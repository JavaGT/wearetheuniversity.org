The related impact on coastal resilience and damage to coastal properties are high and rising. At the same time, we see an increased call for Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to help solve these challenges. Science can play an important role in providing knowledge to upscale the implementation of NbS, such as results from eco-hydraulic research and innovative monitoring of natural dynamics in water systems. In the Chesapeake Bay, oyster integration on gray infrastructures, wetland restoration and living shorelines are among prominent examples of NbS. Eco-geomorphic modeling offers an opportunity to test and quantify NbS impact facing sea level rise.<br><br>William Nardin is an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science – Horn Point Laboratory. Prior to this role, he conducted post-doctoral research at Indiana University, Boston University, and University of California – Berkeley. His research focuses on the application of Nature-based Solutions for coastal resilience. He holds a Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, and Ph.D in Environmental Engineering from the University of Rome, La Sapienza.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>all right why don't we why don't we get<br>going and at least I can do the so thank<br>you everyone for coming it is my great<br>pleasure to introduce associate<br>professor William narden who is at the<br>University of Maryland Center for<br>environmental science which is a great<br>institution over in chesp Bay in the US<br>so I can give you a little bit of<br>background I've got it printed out here<br>on my iPad so will finished his PhD in<br>environmental engineering from the<br>University of Rome in Italy and then he<br>did post research at Indiana University<br>Boston University which is when I<br>actually met William we did a project in<br>the meong Delta together and then<br>University of California and Berkeley<br>and then since finishing at Berkeley<br>he's been at uh Maryland at the horn<br>Point laboratory and he's going to talk<br>to us today about nature based<br>Solutions thank you very much Julia the<br>can introduction so yeah like there will<br>be like some space just to introduce the<br>NBS concept because I'm not sure if you<br>all are aware of Nas solution what<br>doesn't mean and uh then I will check<br>two different<br>exampes the I started when I landed in<br>Marland 2017 so you know the first one<br>is going to be the oyster bi reef and I<br>will tell the oy nothing about oysters<br>until Landing there we have like one of<br>the biggest aery actually<br>in we have the biggest aery because they<br>are building a bigger one in New York I<br>guess but so far we have like the<br>biggest arery o arery on the Eastern<br>Eastern side of us and uh and like you<br>know living Shoreline something that we<br>are starting it's a really a new kind of<br>coastal protection made of rock seal and<br>Mar on the back that the in Marland is<br>regulated you have to build in that way<br>that you have to prove that you cannot<br>build in that way to build with a great<br>infrastructure so it's also like we have<br>some work we start some work on living<br>Shoreline and then we restoration you<br>saw like the image before on PO Island<br>where we are it's really like a<br>playground for geologist ecologist<br>sedimentologist because there a lot of<br>new designing there that's happening Al<br>as engineer too so why first let's let's<br>take a a moment to think like you know<br>natural based solution because for a<br>long time we we talk about like<br>ecological engineering or engineering<br>with nature BL Green City depending on<br>where we are thinking to work with like<br>you know sometimes but also depend from<br>the regions right because if you go<br>Scandinavian region they have like a<br>definition in the Netherlands EOS shape<br>if you are in US you are familiar with<br>the nnf natural natural based features<br>or now it's Eng with nature so there's a<br>lot of different name but they they they<br>are talking all about the same thing<br>like you know acting with the acting and<br>restoring with the ecology some for<br>example like<br>environmental Coastal environments or<br>like Riv in environment too so this is<br>the definition by The Other Nation you<br>can read there so the so the next step<br>like focusing on the cost lines of<br>course this it's a a paper natur GE<br>science that was a 10 years ago now 11<br>years there is a investigating as a<br>first step the you know different<br>approaches right so if you look at the<br>at the different lines you have like<br>estories and the the below one you have<br>like more the coast line with the Sandy<br>Coast lines and you can see like how the<br>effects of so all the Orange Line in the<br>first blot here is showing all the<br>orange part like infrastructure you can<br>see<br>like constraint the storm surge of<br>course you can amplify the stor Sur<br>effect inside the<br>the then you because you are not<br>importing sediment and then you have<br>subsidence it's going to happen anyway<br>in cities in other area but if you build<br>like then you know for the First Column<br>is like conventional cost Gru but if you<br>think more greenstem Bas cost of Defense<br>you can maybe have like wath on the<br>coast lines opening up and making the<br>Wetland flooding so you can import<br>sediment or maybe add more you know<br>Wetland creation too right so you going<br>to have the substance any way in the the<br>areas but then you can have the other<br>part of the system reacting and trapping<br>siment and creating in the long term if<br>you move in the coast L this are refer<br>more like for Bach nourishment<br>specifically for work has been done in<br>the Netherlands with a sand engine I<br>don't know familiar with this kind of<br>project they dump in a huge amount of<br>send you know know just in one time you<br>know not like periodically but a big<br>nourishment and there are now tracking<br>how the sediment is moving to the Dune<br>system which is better than having like<br>a SE wall because a sea wall will stop<br>the sediment to go back so also there<br>are now all you know the somewhere let's<br>say in Maryland maybe you can do like<br>green totally green because we have a<br>space we have a enough well even like<br>you know some cities there is no space<br>but mostly we have like a land which<br>allow the flooding right you can flood<br>you can trop the set but if you are for<br>example like in Miami you have no space<br>so you have to do something else you<br>have to anyway do like some gray<br>infrastructure so you can combine green<br>and gray you do high you can do like a<br>minimal defense with no defense all I<br>don't think it's going to work but<br>natural defense are all green but we<br>some o mentioned the tamman work is we<br>need space to do green so maybe the<br>solution is going to merge gray and<br>green<br>together and why is important because<br>also like most of the human live near<br>the coast so like you know very very<br>well in New Zealand but now 50% of the<br>human lives within 200 kilm of the coast<br>and there a large soci societal Reliance<br>on C like dense human communities and<br>it's a large drive also for the economy<br>too<br>if we go specifically Maryland uh<br>coastal flooding in the the<br>recent time is really like something<br>almost B monly happening for example in<br>Cambridge this are a picture I think<br>from Annapolis where now there's an area<br>like daily flooded because the the C<br>rise is it's in in the in the especially<br>like in in Maryland it's one of the<br>greatest in the in the US and then we<br>per so I want to show like this picture<br>because I really show like you isn't<br>Feit but it's a showing like you know<br>the the day of flooding the you you know<br>now it's a you see from 1950 to 20 2015<br>how is increasing this frequency of<br>flooding on the normal like Sunday day<br>flooding or wance flooding so and the C<br>R is Project to be one 1.2 meter by 2100<br>in a big Bay and if we do not act now we<br>don't know if you know you're going to<br>be able to to you know to have a normal<br>life because once you flooded the road<br>like this school bus is not going to go<br>and then you're not going to you're<br>going to have your kids home you're not<br>going to work right so it's going to<br>impact a lot of the life so these are an<br>example from Little Chop Tank River so<br>my my lab is here right here this The<br>Chop Tank Riv is a little Chop Tank<br>River those are three islands that we<br>are restoring now jyes Island I'm<br>working there so we I we show like<br>another stud Cas like from po Island and<br>you can see that the sides this those<br>are 30 years you can see the sides the<br>yellow is at the end of the T years and<br>the red Lin show like at the beginning<br>in like 1980 so there is a a lot of land<br>leing because it's not only erosion now<br>you know most of the locals think it's<br>erosion so waves they always we always<br>we always saw like erosion around the<br>waves always erode the islands and this<br>like it's not C rise it's just waves is<br>waves but you know I think the waves are<br>you know attacking at the different<br>elevation and they are able to erod more<br>that's the key<br>point so let's start from the first<br>approach<br>so we uh I would say like the Marland<br>soan really open mind like we they<br>really push on natural based solution<br>especially with the new<br>Administration even at the national<br>level so the we we had the opportunity<br>to have like different brands to work<br>and you can see for example like an<br>infrastructur it's called R now is a<br>break water that was a r you can see the<br>signs of erosion on the back so from<br>1998 it was like you know working more<br>or less to now it's completely fled it's<br>droning so the idea is that break waters<br>are fissures around Bay to protect with<br>from the waves attack waves erosion so I<br>think we want to try to add something<br>there for example oyster to see if they<br>can grow vertically and create like a<br>better Dynamic structure right because<br>not<br>only so with level rise the level is<br>going to grow and then oyster are going<br>to grow with with the sea level so this<br>this the<br>idea um yeah this are like you know this<br>is an example showing four break Motors<br>and this is the only Ro Ser like a of 50<br>people in the back here so that that is<br>noted like we know<br>like they build recently those bre WS<br>but they they're not working properly<br>because also like the the gr<br>infrastructure is not able to<br>react<br>so that's an example of uh you know a<br>sketch showing more or<br>less what is the situation now right so<br>the water level you know if we build a<br>um a break water now the engineer want<br>to build somehow to dump and more as<br>possible everything is going to deposit<br>on the back and you know the cost is<br>going to be protected but what happen if<br>the SE level is rising so then we will<br>have like the waves are not dumping like<br>maybe you know some we we still have<br>like 10 or 20% of dumping but then you<br>start erosion on the coast L and then<br>you have less deposition on the back a<br>lot of export of siment and uh you<br>you're going to lose land essentially so<br>the idea is like adding oysters to those<br>infrastructure the oyster can build like<br>a structure that in the long term is<br>going to rise to the to the sea level<br>and then is able to dampen the waves and<br>protect the<br>coastal so to do that we found um<br>these blocks those blocks are called<br>oyster castles they like 25 kilos I<br>think 20 kilos I think you can you know<br>we can you can pass to each other you<br>know with a lot of we build like we like<br>what we build we build something Co and<br>this is a difference between um you can<br>see that small oysters here see that<br>them so it's a it's a a cinder block<br>made of concrete and oyster shell so the<br>oyster really like found a good<br>substrate to to attach and then to grow<br>and you can see like a well developed<br>one after one year you have like this<br>structure so that's that's Virginia<br>that's this this compan is in Virginia<br>like in the Virginia Coastal base we<br>have some challenging some challenges in<br>the in the The Chop Tank Creer because<br>it's too fresh so we have a different<br>kind of oyster it's kind of complicated<br>but it's like more on the ecology side<br>which like you know I have another<br>colleagues taking care of of the that<br>part for me it's just want like a<br>structure anything it's I don't care<br>much about I want to I want to be clear<br>so so they created like a 3D structure<br>fully developed they can set repair you<br>know even if you have like an event<br>antram event breaking the structure they<br>also are able to grow on top of each<br>other and cre like a new they self<br>prepared essentially they provide<br>several ecosystem Services because they<br>also like remove a lot of nutrients from<br>the water so you have like also the<br>benefit of increasing the water quality<br>so B is a b there so we discovered like<br>a lot of problem with recruitment<br>salinity and the main water level are<br>crucial for the oyster survival so<br>essentially let's think about like this<br>oyster you you have an oyster some<br>somehow and then the the oyster Survivor<br>grow decrease increasing the inter<br>position because the top one that get<br>stressed by ice in the<br>winter there's offs<br>for desiccation in the summer so they<br>have a lot of issue they get you know<br>harvesting like they got eat by boat<br>sometimes so that you know they get they<br>they they<br>die<br>but if you think for example to you know<br>so this curve translated so the Suter<br>region they are more resilient while the<br>other region they have like those issues<br>like they are less resilient um so<br>that's that's you know the ecology side<br>of this oyster R so this how an<br>ecologist think as an engineer I think<br>this I want to be built as much as<br>possible as high as possible because I<br>want to be sure the dump 100% of the<br>Waves I don't care about oysters I'm<br>just kidding because I know that I need<br>the O is alive otherwise I'm not going<br>to work right this not going to work so<br>the trade off between me and my<br>colleagues you know there's a guy is a<br>EOP physiologist and working oysters say<br>okay let's do this like a subtitle for<br>me was a big Trad off and then let's see<br>you know if the oyster survive<br>essentially so we found we got like<br>sweet spot there so it's a can be good<br>for both more or<br>less so we build uh in our so we are<br>lucky because we are right on the bay in<br>the Chop Tank River and we have um a cve<br>in our backyard essentially so we asked<br>for permit and then we Grant they<br>granted a permit even if you have to go<br>through like a long process because<br>there is no of course<br>oysters structure mention in this permit<br>just leing Shor line you have to explain<br>what you're going to do why you going to<br>do it's gonna it's going to damage Sav<br>it's going to damage Mar there a lot of<br>political agencies problem there that we<br>have to solve so by the end we did it<br>after nine months like you know like a<br>baby we got finally a permit and then we<br>build like four different bre quers and<br>we also had like some old bre quers that<br>so after this first deployment we also<br>build on top of the four break waterers<br>they actually they are under water I<br>know if you can see that you can see<br>dark they're they're not outside anymore<br>they're underwater so we build also on<br>top of them to see like if the oyster<br>can colonize the Rocks be you know below<br>the blocks and this my student yob just<br>graduated he was like really helping a<br>lot with this project actually did<br>almost<br>everything so and those are the signs of<br>erosion that we have in our cve so and<br>then all those strees in 2017 they were<br>up so this a picture from 2021 or 2022<br>so the the erosion by the waves are is<br>increasing but also there are other<br>effects but the<br>erosion we were able to stop some of<br>thetion so not not not all of<br>it so but coming back to our permit so<br>to convince them really so we have to<br>first do next some prelimin experiment<br>even because there was nothing in<br>literature showing how we can do this<br>kind of<br>um how the bre really impact on the back<br>the the marshes so because we have to be<br>honest with the the agency and theart of<br>environment saying that you know that's<br>true that we're going to reduce the<br>boundary erosion but also we have we are<br>reducing the amount of sediment going on<br>top of the marsh which is making like<br>the marsh more resilient in the long<br>term so it was a kind of trade off and<br>this is just one example of the<br>experiment with the death video we did<br>with a break<br>water and then now that's also like a<br>structure that we build like you see<br>this<br>structure all the green stuff it's not<br>good this algae so the algae killed<br>everything in the beginning so that's<br>you know you have to also learn<br>something so we a lot of a lot of Errors<br>a lot of issues so we learned that you<br>know summer time is not a good time to<br>do that to to sit and put them because<br>it's like a huge competition crabs go<br>there they detou eat everything<br>Barnacles muscles algae everything was<br>against oysters the oyster didn't<br>survive of course but the sub one yes<br>they survived the sub so at the end we<br>removed the one the top one and put the<br>oysters on top so they are now happy<br>because they are very happy but there's<br>another issue those say you can see this<br>are almost all the same sides because<br>all brothers and sisters there's no<br>equipment so in the long term if they<br>die nobody's going to colonize them so<br>we are hoping that maybe they can kind<br>of reproduce but I don't think we don't<br>think that's really like so recruitment<br>is very important you have to be in an<br>active area where you have oyster lar<br>going around so they again once they<br>found with this substrate they're going<br>to be happy they're going to touch it<br>and then grow but there was like no<br>really good um also position so well we<br>are struggling we are working on it<br>still working on<br>it so we did our deployment and then we<br>also track the morphological Evolution<br>so because we want to see like the Cent<br>transport we want to see also how much<br>waves they can dumpen how much sediment<br>is accumulating on the back so we<br>started our measurements as engineers<br>and geomorphologist to understand the<br>the morphodynamics so this our<br>deployment waves are coming directly<br>from that position from the north and we<br>had like two aquad doopler and a buoy<br>measuring the the the water level and<br>the the also the significant in period<br>period also the along the different uh<br>black Waters we track with trans we also<br>did some survey to create a 3D model of<br>the of the B<br>imetry and we discovered that somewhere<br>we have like erosion sometime we have<br>like you know they looking at the for<br>example plot a transact number one the<br>first one you can see the they actually<br>we have erosion because in July 2019 we<br>had like higher elevation the black L<br>high elevation the red L should like a<br>lower evolution of the three years<br>because essentially the waves are able<br>to go behind the the break water and the<br>road on that side transect two on the<br>other side actually show Theos so<br>because because there was also like in<br>the we know we knew that we have to<br>angle angle them but we really didn't<br>get like the permit to do that because<br>it was like some distance we cannot go<br>too far away from the coast line so we<br>have to Deo that with the angle so the<br>the we had some issues with the erosion<br>position Al like like mostly like the<br>the deployment the the wind that we<br>measured the the staty side you can see<br>also like this Northwest Direction which<br>is like entering and align with our<br>black<br>found initially is uh if you look at the<br>plot a so the black line shows the water<br>level measured in Cambridge which is<br>like a couple kilometers from our study<br>side and the the the green circle<br>showing like our the water level we<br>measure with the aquad do and you can<br>see like it is a good agreement between<br>the aquad doop and the Noah station and<br>also we we checked the significant wavei<br>in front of the break water so with the<br>the spotter boy and then on the back<br>with the aquad aquad doopler ey<br>resolution and we saw there is like some<br>web dampen right you see there some<br>reduction on significant W the Blue Line<br>showing like the measurements before the<br>break cers are higher than the but they<br>what then what we we're looking for like<br>what's difference between high tide and<br>low tide so we were expecting actually I<br>was pretty happy to see 52% of wave<br>dampening with the high tide because I<br>thought like you know it's going to be<br>the waves are going to be over that's it<br>but then the W this experiment would be<br>you know kind of hard for this kind of<br>system like you know5<br>met so they were big enough and uh but<br>the low part we like 95% of damping<br>which was like a I would see like a<br>success so<br>then uh after we we measure so well we<br>measure we validated our measurements<br>with the spotter boy and<br>theop put profiler then we went to<br>models because we want to we want to do<br>some gaming with C so to be sure and<br>then actually during the the videoi we<br>got lucky that we had a huge high tide<br>and then a huge low tide and the all was<br>empty and we through the Drone with<br>structure for Mo we build a very good um<br>um dation model uh so there was always<br>fled there there always like a half<br>meter a met of of water but you know you<br>can see like my standing there close to<br>a pressure<br>sensor um s so she she was a she was<br>helping with the kind of measurements so<br>we build our model you can see the model<br>there like a the with a small grid like<br>you know 2 by 5 m and then outside the<br>Chop Tank River with a bigger grid to<br>develop the waves with wind so we have<br>wind measurements we can we can<br>actually create our web condition with<br>the<br>wind so now that we have a<br>uh now that we have<br>measurements measurements from from Noah<br>station measurements for withad doopler<br>profiler then we start to model the<br>condition that we had we had like a good<br>agreement again for water level you can<br>see on top a it bit less with the<br>significant to we you can see there are<br>some points that we're missing but<br>probably I think we found it was like a<br>due to the um the grid so we also we<br>don't know especially those two paks<br>there which is blue line should like the<br>spot me and then the mod is not able to<br>catch those<br>pigs essentially because I think this<br>was like kind of refraction from the bre<br>water we stayed enough far from the bre<br>water to do not feel the bre water but I<br>think there was some you know with the<br>bigger ways May there was some<br>reflection some refraction they impacted<br>the the measure<br>so the gaming and I will show just the<br>gaming but I will not show the results<br>because otherwise we're going to stay<br>here two<br>days uh so that's what so essentially<br>the goal was<br>uh we want to see C level rise so we<br>want to found four scenarios with the<br>actual new water level 20 years level<br>rise projection 50 and 100 years so we<br>did all those four scenarios and on top<br>of those four scenarios we had four scar<br>of wind wave energy and also three<br>landscape because want to see like no<br>break water break water and break water<br>with oair but theod was was missing a<br>piece because we we need to really like<br>know the drag coefficient of the O is on<br>top of the break quar so we have to go<br>in the lap and then we show you like in<br>the next part so at the end we were able<br>to this kind of results mamic results<br>just an example of results you can see<br>there was Rion here here so we have<br>accumulation of sediment you can see<br>this this red part is a sediment<br>accumulating<br>there after some after sometimes like<br>you know after few years of the<br>Revolution ruction you can see there<br>signant way which is increasing here<br>that means you know we have a Rion on<br>this side and this what we found like<br>also in our measurements so we were good<br>enough it's you know it's published in<br>one another in 2023 we have another two<br>papers coming out from this experiment<br>this is why I'm not going to a lot<br>because otherwise going to be very<br>intense so then we jump in the room<br>because we want to see like the drag<br>coefficient really want to understand so<br>we take our blocks put in a in a van and<br>the van went from from Maryland to<br>Illinois in in urban champagne where we<br>have like was<br>available wave Flom where we<br>tested some you know for example blocks<br>oysters and no oysters right right so<br>this are all the configuration we tried<br>you can see p one like the we so we 3D<br>printed the blocks in scale 1 to eight<br>like a small blocks and then we attach<br>them I will show like in one the next<br>figure like and then we also do a<br>structureal promotion with the blocks<br>and we create like all those combination<br>because we say like okay we can do like<br>this is what we have done like in the in<br>the code but what about we dis W not<br>only for impact and roughness but also<br>only for roughness at the the botom<br>right let's try this let's go combine<br>that let's do a bigger so we try you<br>know there a lot of gaming around and<br>with a different R level different<br>velocities but with the values close to<br>what we have measured in the<br>field so that's like the particle image<br>velocimetry so I hope the other one is<br>particle symmetry here this like just a<br>video with a phone you see the flow<br>Direction you can see some recirculation<br>on the back so it was a was good enough<br>to estimate the direct ficient because<br>we know the flow before and after so we<br>can understand the the the strength of<br>the block to dissipate the the you know<br>the energy going from one side to the<br>other side<br>so this is actually the results from the<br>the velocity reaction intensity from the<br>p and those are the two different case<br>men you can see that those are<br>oysters without oysters and we we are<br>comparing the the two different<br>results so and also this the velocity<br>profile you can see the velocity profile<br>like all those lines these are<br>again with oyers without oysters you can<br>see circulations happening also we are<br>looking also this different erosion on<br>the back so the in this<br>direction so here<br>not going to show the results you know<br>but what we found is that the the Dr<br>coefficient increase with o on top of<br>course because there more roughness more<br>um<br>dissipation for the<br>energy but what's next next is that we<br>got funded again so this a bigger<br>project now we have to go in a huge Plum<br>it's like 30 by 50 m we're going to<br>create a real waves here and we're going<br>to do two different<br>reefs um you a fail Di bcv and we're<br>going to build our Reef there all of<br>siment all of shoveling three students<br>shoveling sand all day long it's going<br>to be good for them so and then we're<br>going to find like different weight so<br>this BL is so big that you you can also<br>get a pump<br>system water in cre the condition so you<br>can do a long long sh com too so that's<br>um an opportunity but they really give<br>you like money say you go in miss you<br>work there so the students are going to<br>two this another so the the project I<br>just show was a actually the first part<br>of the oyster Reef was a all small money<br>different<br>foundations and the big one is founded<br>by yop engineer this also founded bycor<br>engineer because there's a huge interest<br>in in with nation right now they really<br>want to understand better how the system<br>react and the goal here was can we use<br>everything we know for natural marshes<br>for living shorelines understanding the<br>lateral erosion how the marsh can expand<br>so that was the goal of the project so<br>the living show this is a picture of a<br>living show like rock seal and Mar on<br>the back these are 16 years old and as I<br>I will show you there are some problem<br>this a close to Ocean City so again we<br>we did some field measurements and<br>different seasons and also we did some<br>we develop numerical model with<br>fet so those are essentially field work<br>was twice a year 2021 2022 we did like a<br>vegetation biomass sediment course GPS<br>survey and uh check elevation we with<br>the Drone we develop like a dig<br>elevation model and we also did some<br>sediment cor to berum derived sediment<br>deis Grand sides so we we we worked with<br>another colleague together to prepare<br>the the model all this data they feed<br>the<br>model but<br>also comparing the the two environments<br>we discovered that you know the natural<br>Mar actually is a roing like very well<br>like you know four almost four meters in<br>five years so it's a huge amount you can<br>see like the SS of erosion and this very<br>cool there's something you can see this<br>lamp here these are all muss together<br>and they they hold up all the land the<br>land is like attached to muscles all the<br>boundary it's muscle Community they are<br>building those the marsh is growing in<br>the middle of the most spes of muscles I<br>should I should should propose on this<br>have time so the the other study side<br>was a so this it's called Sunset Island<br>a it's a a residence Village and they<br>have like a natural Mar on the other<br>side they have a li sh line pretty old<br>16 years old which is kind of good for<br>for Marland because they are building a<br>of precursor of this<br>new new technology so but they're also<br>experiencing erosion to and then we call<br>like open water conversion so there is<br>also there because R I will tell you but<br>that's so we we try to quantify because<br>what what really is important for<br>natural based solution and what the<br>engineers are looking for is<br>quantification so because what we<br>discovered in that in the living<br>Shoreline it was buil with the kind of<br>flat slope it also was not in the right<br>elevation so really they Sofer a lot for<br>from the wave attack so we we did some<br>you know some work really with the GPS<br>and drone that at the beginning and we<br>found that the proportion of water was<br>increased as the elevation of s Mar<br>decreased and at the same elevation the<br>natural March was more likely to convert<br>open water that was really like<br>something that was kind of well known<br>marshes but you know we didn't expect in<br>leing short because we expect there was<br>like abundance<br>was like a s that boundary with the with<br>the you know the rock seal but the rock<br>seal was not really working<br>well so and then also we we saw like<br>there's also a lack of sediment right C<br>rice and the lack of sediment all those<br>B have not siment actually no sediment<br>input because the few Rivers they around<br>they are done for agriculture or farming<br>so there's no like a real of sediment<br>coming down from those Rivers so in fact<br>in fact we found like a peak of of sment<br>deposition in July and look here like<br>this charge of this small river right<br>close to the to the stud side so we have<br>a peck here and then you know we went to<br>October was you know was not P here a<br>lot of nothing was like in Spring spring<br>really was a lot of sment and then we<br>had no sent again and then we had a<br>little bit of pick like less than the<br>one we had you know again increasing the<br>position so this a really a big<br>dependence not only from C RS but also<br>like from sediment<br>inputs this kind of close the second<br>part is short so because I think we need<br>a break<br>here so but um the third part it's a<br>something I really like because it's a<br>it's a playground for me so it's a all<br>you can see this Mar here they have been<br>built between<br>2000 yeah every 2000 and they are we<br>still building those still like working<br>in this area here now this this a new<br>one this a new there like uh it's a it<br>was AIC<br>Island you know the size you can see now<br>but was a then it was like I think one<br>left so we are monitoring we are also<br>assisting the the company there to uh<br>develop those channels the red elevation<br>marshes different marshes we have like<br>two different kind of marsh we are<br>mapping with the my fancy drone that is<br>uh is German we can fly the Drone there<br>now so but also we measuring the<br>Channel all the different velocities<br>this just a quick overview of the<br>approach that we use aop profiler for in<br>the channels for you know flow velocity<br>and backc intensity GPS and drone for<br>elevation and this Co samper for<br>suspended concentration and quadrats and<br>drone for estimate the vegetation so<br>what we noticed for example in know one<br>cell that we started with this cell cell<br>1B that there was a since we we had like<br>all the project all the the definition<br>so we have the the year zero so and then<br>we monitoring from year zero so we saw<br>first of all<br>like the the sh of so this is some<br>enlarging some enlarging of those<br>channels the channel are expanding<br>laterally but also the channels are in<br>fing so you can see like the the the<br>Blue Line shows the actual 2018 or 2019<br>2018 cross-section and the red L show<br>like the the<br>initial the as buil like engineering has<br>buil so the inial configuration the<br>and then we s like there was a lot of<br>feeling because we have to advise them<br>on cross-section geometry or uh even<br>those Channel we are now trying to work<br>also on<br>sinuosity uh on the this this network of<br>channels there's a lot of interest on<br>understanding those processes so like<br>those different you can see secondary<br>Chan they feel like 25 cm the primary<br>channels like a main CH like a 40 cm<br>so yeah this some results with the Drone<br>that we have done to create like Auto<br>photo RGB camera that we have done<br>structure for motion we can create the<br>digitation model of our winter time<br>because we the vegetation very low also<br>this year finally they burned one cell<br>they you know they go there with the<br>fire they burn all the vegetation I can<br>do no vegetation study so there is it's<br>going to rebound but because it's again<br>it's a playground so you it's not this<br>is not access for you have to you have<br>to um it's you SC engineer andmental<br>service you have to book an appointment<br>to get there it's a boat is an item of<br>course you have the boat so it's not<br>accessible so it's um it's also like a<br>construction site so we did some also<br>seasonality with vegetation from uh<br>spring so because our model need the<br>geometry and need also on the platform<br>the right vegetation so we have two<br>different species you can see like here<br>p<br>is and you see p is kind of more<br>resilient winter time but you can see<br>like the projection from early April<br>like winter kind of winter condition and<br>then spring summer fall and then again<br>but<br>colder so then we build our<br>model it started yes started so the<br>the cell 1B we imported all the geometry<br>we place all the different vegetation<br>the goal here is try to understand let's<br>go back in the nor the initial condition<br>add some vegetation and then flood with<br>the the ties that we measure and then<br>see if we can recreate what we have that<br>we have measured in 2018 so that's the<br>validation from the mod and then we have<br>we would like to project with C rise<br>this model so but the real big<br>question we are working with theop<br>Engineers how to approach the channel<br>geometry because it's a there are<br>different School of thinking about the<br>channel geometry but we want to try to<br>find kind of a procedure so for sure<br>that well I have to tell you like a<br>little bit about the popular Island<br>project popular Island project a it's a<br>two two goals they have me two goals so<br>they Dred the the sediment in the<br>Baltimore Harbor and they take the<br>dredge material in place to create this<br>new habitat for bird migration it was<br>like a big this big island was like um a<br>place for birds to rest before going to<br>Canada and other plac in North so<br>the the goal is like you know restoring<br>it also place somewhere the sediment so<br>the so the goal is keeping the sediment<br>inside so flood dominance means the FL<br>the energy of the flooding has to be uh<br>higher than the being because we we need<br>more sh stress higher velocity higher sh<br>stress to bring the sediment up and put<br>the sediment on the marsh where we want<br>to like create more<br>resiliency and also we want to see like<br>the channel morphologic Evolution time<br>if is able to face like challeng like<br>you C rice for example this just you<br>know I'm going you know this just<br>something to radi show like you know the<br>different essentially you want this this<br>charge and this velocity high right<br>that's the goal<br>um so then Cell 5 CD it's another cell<br>all names so this cell is the southern<br>part of the island they are planning to<br>build this 2026 so they asked me to do<br>like um um morphological model of this<br>cell so we get we had like the the<br>project we imported everything GIS we<br>export a degeneration model and we build<br>like this kind of model it's a real<br>model actually in the real Dimension and<br>we are down as much as possible with the<br>grid GD cell size 2 m by 2 m and then we<br>propagate the water level which is the<br>only foring is water level and then we<br>have also the vegetation and everything<br>we know from popular Island from the<br>other cell we have their sent<br>characteristics and vegetation we know<br>the<br>PES so we want to see if so we check<br>first if the velocity were like you know<br>in a range<br>of values that we can say you know it's<br>a it's a real value so we we checked<br>actually<br>those um new cross section because we<br>suggest them this a publication 2019<br>from one of my students we suggest them<br>to do like you know wider and shallower<br>shape cross- section because it's able<br>to First transmit more sediment on the<br>March but also is not is impacting<br>positively like with the flat dominance<br>we check FL dominance all along<br>the the stream of the of the<br>creek so goal number one and then the<br>goal number two to AC with wider CH show<br>flood dominance the the second goal was<br>try to see are we able to send the<br>sediment on top of the marsh and we<br>track with other observation points and<br>this is just an example with three<br>observation points we have like a lot of<br>crosssection observation points around<br>and we and we saw like there is a this<br>the we impose there's like system like<br>5.6 M we saw like the like there is a<br>positive sedimentation on on the on the<br>on different parts of the cell uh but<br>especially close to the mouth because<br>essentially we saw that when we when the<br>t is eing increase the concentration of<br>sediment at the mouth and then when it's<br>flooding back this High concentration of<br>sediment is disposed on top<br>of of the marsh yeah the marsh platform<br>this is again our model showing like<br>some morphological<br>Evolution start here so in 10 years<br>Evolution we we but<br>this it's a five G per liter<br>concentration what what we measure there<br>in um summer summer time no winter time<br>so we we want to like<br>check 02 Kil Peru met more like<br>conditions in summertime where we have a<br>lot of organic matter coming from the<br>the marsh the marsh so we have like<br>higher kind of torpidity and<br>availability of sediment but um what<br>what we saw like probably you cannot see<br>very well here but you see a clear area<br>close the mouth there the so there is a<br>some deposition of s the col<br>sedimentation and we have sedimentation<br>also in in the in the channel but then<br>we know we selected those channels that<br>was in 4 cm and not 40 cm in 10 years<br>not in five years so we are happy enough<br>to say okay we will have some<br>sedimentation but also we have some<br>sediment going on top of of the<br>marsh so and then we also check along<br>with the different cross-section to see<br>if there is any<br>Evolution but also we discover that<br>those since those<br>cross-section are in equilibrium already<br>there's not like a sediment availability<br>because the probably in the first year<br>or two when the this flooded this<br>spending a lot of fine particles because<br>you know the beginning it's like just<br>bare ground it's you know planted Marsh<br>and then they open the inlet and then<br>they flood so that first flood is going<br>to resuspend a all of sediment and then<br>you're going to you're going to see like<br>the first couple months is a it's a lot<br>of sediment going around but it's not<br>really the normal condition<br>for<br>flying so we also checked that the<br>secondary channels so this the first was<br>second CH but we saw like again this<br>secondary Channel since it's close to<br>the mouth has a higher availability of<br>siment we have a higher sedimentation<br>because it's like how you build this<br>network so they you build CH was like<br>another question you know sity how you<br>build people system is like a variety of<br>of Channel network shapes so now we are<br>suggest maybe you have to do like more<br>of those small channels close to mouth<br>because you able to chop more sediment<br>more than having like a very long um<br>long very long main<br>channel so yeah that's it long time<br>right<br>questions you<br>anything sure um thank you for that that<br>was really really interesting um what<br>I'm wondering about is the um I'm trying<br>to like not use my uh indigenous<br>language um the species of oysters were<br>they um indigenous to the area or were<br>they a different species from another<br>space good question so as long as I know<br>because I'm not an ecologist so<br>those Virg which is like very common in<br>ch Bay but the chop Tech River has a<br>specific where we are like chop River<br>it's a actually very pricey because it's<br>a small more round oyster called the<br>chop and sweet because it's sweet if you<br>eat is sweet it's not like salty and<br>that one is impossible to make reprodu<br>it oh okay yeah in the LA so the C<br>Virginia they there was if you look<br>around like there a lot of publication<br>because it's a I think it's easy iier<br>but yeah I should if I remember<br>correctly from my colleagues he was<br>telling me that it's easier but then we<br>have like Sal problem there because it's<br>fresh like a brish brish even our o<br>actually they started operation in May<br>if they don't get do not eat like the<br>red condition and salinity it's a<br>problem for the for the a in the last<br>few years we had a lot of rainy spring<br>it was hard to uh make like the oyster<br>because they they always like also sell<br>around for reproduction and other you<br>know for farming so yeah so there also<br>seem to be um quite a a big population<br>of muscles as well so was there any<br>reason why you didn't use the muscles on<br>on the on the Wier castles well we found<br>we found them there we found them like<br>it's actually between the actually I<br>think muscles are more happy than yeah<br>yeah if they like really prolific they<br>might be more inclined to reproduce yeah<br>yeah I think I think there's something<br>also like with disease if I remember<br>correctly which muscles are like uh more<br>prone to get disease are disease there<br>so and uh I think have like a big<br>archery for oysters I have to use<br>oysters but it's a good point I would<br>love to I actually we we are trying to<br>explore more you know now that we<br>discover like barnacles muscles and I<br>found this muscles on the on the living<br>Shoreline I really want to actually have<br>a student coming this summer and she her<br>topic is working she works another in<br>Europe but she told me I want to work<br>with M okay come come she's a bus<br>scholar coming probably in in Fall when<br>I going back but yeah Master we we found<br>between because there's a lot of space<br>between oysters they feel there can you<br>eat the oysters of course that's a<br>really important question right can you<br>Mar well I think they will get so<br>actually once they start to establish<br>that there is an explosion of I was<br>standing the other day to Asel and Julia<br>is like we found like SD on the back<br>there was like no ICD before and then we<br>found so that's<br>submerged Cass Cass and then also we<br>found like blue crabs because they like<br>also those holes between in the the the<br>oyster cast so they go side so there's<br>like rock fish everything people go<br>there fishing now but that's you know<br>that yeah that's you know we get a kind<br>of abidat they kind of really you know a<br>questions um your channel design in your<br>the last section um uh where you put it<br>in a single step is there a reason why<br>you only thought of doing a single step<br>channnel design rather than a multi-step<br>so that in specific location so you can<br>increase the amount of sent<br>shift yeah we thought about that yeah<br>that's uh<br>there sorry I know it's harder to model<br>yeah the modeling yeah the modeling is<br>hard and that's like uh you know if you<br>go and talk with those companies that<br>build you don't want to go with them we<br>say oh I want like a<br>1.5 what I'm I'm going with a ticker I'm<br>going to do like I do my best to do like<br>just me elevation there and elevation<br>okay okay okay so you have to you know<br>also be I canot the the cross-section<br>there from the inlet they actually a<br>it's almost is also armored you know<br>with the<br>Rocks you can I think there are some<br>specific because Al there's another<br>issue which you can see over there from<br>the the main picture of the the island<br>so there's a private island in front so<br>one one part of that is private so they<br>don't want the jet to be too long you<br>have to be sure that the jet of the f<br>is not eating the island on front so I<br>think they also make larger to be able<br>to you know reduce the flux in the<br>velocity do not scour or make impacts on<br>the other side of the islands so it's<br>just if you start modifying velocity<br>through it and then on some of the back<br>side depending what of the the turns<br>you'll actually land up getting<br>accretion of sediment and change in<br>vegetation object like you can model it<br>and just you you remember me another<br>topic so you know you can imagine you go<br>this uh it's gon cut this part but it's<br>we go like with a lot of agencies and<br>this someone cares about like Gees<br>someone cares about like sa Cass sorry<br>someone cares about like Fisheries so we<br>have to be sure that we make everybody<br>happy so for example the conjunction of<br>of the two channels it's important<br>because create a boundary where the fish<br>hide and then they wait for the prey to<br>come so really the The Fishery side of<br>Noah they want to this conjunction like<br>they want to really see so we have to<br>you know to be make everybody happy<br>there because it's like also we some<br>experiment with pawns which for me as as<br>a as a wet restoration said no please<br>not PS it's it's a proxy for erosion in<br>the marsh why P we need attract big fish<br>okay okay do the ponds said now I'm<br>monitoring the pond so okay I to because<br>we already<br>erosion but you know you have to make<br>everybody happy so I think now we found<br>the the the happiness in the wider Chan<br>we say okay let's do um you your your<br>problem is are water bodies let's do a<br>bigger Chanel so can be like also home<br>for fish is different kind of so it's a<br>big trade off this this is the challenge<br>in not your best solution because I'm as<br>an engineer I want to build it some way<br>and then ecologist no no no no no not<br>ecologist like you know multiple<br>ecologist you know is one fish like SE<br>grass it's like<br>fun see if there's any questions from<br>online yeah we do<br>that and we should probably that not we<br>should probably uh think about wrapping<br>up see<br>go see any questions from online so um I<br>guess we're close to 1 o00 so we should<br>again<br>diversify so on<br>of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
