Born, raised and educated in Tasmania, Andrew moved to Melbourne after graduating from the University of Tasmania.<br><br>He has won many awards, including: the Canberra Medallion; The Eleanor Cullis-Hill National Architecture Award; The John and Phyllis Murphy Award and many more. Andrew’s primary focus has been single residential homes; however, in recent years Andrew and Austin Maynard Architects have delved into multi-residential housing as both developer and architect, resulting in Terrace House (pictured), an 8.2-star sustainable community that won ArchDaily’s Building of the Year award, Gold at the Good Design Awards and a swathe of sustainability and architecture awards; the 9.1-star ParkLife at the Nightingale Village; and Slate House, an 8.2-star development in Brighton.<br><br>Andrew was a founding director of Nightingale Housing. In 2022, Austin Maynard Architects won Dezeen’s prestigious Architecture Studio of the Year award.<br><br>Andrew was the guest speaker at Te Pare School of Architecture's Fast Forward lecture in April 2024</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>welcome it's exciting to have you here<br>um for

AR black<br>uh um yeah we'd just like to say massive<br>thanks to the University of Auckland and<br>Andrew Barry like what a fantastic<br>lecture Series this is going to be um<br>the first you know

to<br>when you get into the office in the<br>morning pull out one of the projects and<br>specify an extra layer uh somewhere in<br>one of your um uh one of your projects<br>it's great for sound<br>the um so<br>um the younger ones here so welcoming<br>you to Andrew's lecture the younger ones<br>will know Andrew through his kind of<br>fantastic social media presence Aki<br>Marathon charging around buildings of<br>the world and um unlocking their secrets<br>for us older folk will uh know Andrew as<br>a previous speaker a great friend to New<br>Zealand architecture and he's been here<br>a number of times speaking and as a<br>juror for uh New Zealand Awards where<br>he's established a reputation as I think<br>one of the great Charmers um the the<br>great storytellers of of uh AR about<br>architecture in this part of the world<br>uh and the folk in the middle will no<br>doubt um know him as the designer of<br>particularly Innovative housing<br>including the nigh Andale projects which<br>uh at the University of ockland are some<br>of the most studied projects<br>by the students so uh without further<br>mayard thanks for coming hi uh so I can<br>work out what to talk about uh<br>students some hands in the air how many<br>students we got uh and then professional<br>like people work okay cool all right so<br>I can't because there's some<br>people that know what they're talking<br>about in here um all right uh I've got a<br>lot of slides hey nobody ever does this<br>but I'll offer it anyway throw in some<br>questions and heckles along the way<br>don't have to say them till the end um<br>uh great to see some familiar faces too<br>thanks for coming along guys some some<br>uh Ary marathoners that came in uh<br>January to Japan with us we had a blast<br>yeah well didn't we I hope so<br>um all right so this is 2016 being on<br>the national jury what a epic way to see<br>a country being dragged around and you<br>know incredible food and drink that New<br>Zealand has to offer and looking at the<br>best of the these architecture Jasper um<br>uh during the trip told me about this<br>incredible bike ride that goes from Cape<br>ringer all the way to Bluff um which as<br>the crow flies is400<br>kilm um and all across country and I<br>thought that sounds awesome I'm going to<br>give that a crack and then in<br>2018 did that the worst thing that's<br>ever happened to<br>me and the best thing that's ever<br>happened to me uh anybody that was<br>following me on Instagram back there<br>they could see my slow decline into into<br>madness uh doing that but I've seen so<br>much of this incredible country and I<br>feel very very privileged to to return<br>again um that's my beloved Kenneth the<br>bike on that on that side<br>um this is uh I won't read it I'll I'll<br>tell you about it this is I've so in<br>2002 I started my practice at 27 I was a<br>notoriously bad employee always<br>interested in other things um and I just<br>decided that I can't work for other<br>people so I start making up myself<br>at far too young but this image has been<br>with me for a long time or you an image<br>like this I've done some bad AI to in<br>the last couple of days um and basically<br>the story of this is uh it reminds me of<br>the importance of<br>design uh<br>because you don't like it is that what<br>I'm hearing um because this is a story<br>uh from an old person's home where they<br>kept on having uh people that lived<br>there a lot of most of them with<br>dementia disappearing running off and<br>they'd always go and find them at the<br>nearest bus stop so rather than creating<br>and solving it by creating basically a<br>prison what they did was in the grounds<br>they put a bus stop with the sign that<br>everybody recognizes from their<br>childhood and a lovely seat there this<br>isn't the particular one and a seat<br>there so that when people went to go<br>home cuz they got dementia and they<br>don't know what's going on and they go<br>well I'm going to go home they would go<br>and sit at the bus stop a bus never goes<br>there and eventually somebody from the<br>home would come out and say oh the bus<br>is coming a bit later today why don't<br>you come back inside for a cup of tea<br>and by the time they got them back in<br>they' totally forgotten they want to<br>leave in the first place and I just<br>think this is a great reminder<br>especially in Instagram age where we get<br>really seduced by the image um and you<br>know which I I understand is incredibly<br>problematic for students as well like<br>well you want me to do some wobbly<br>object Don't You In Space the design<br>offers so much more than just the<br>beautiful<br>image um super quickly just to give some<br>background I know some of you that have<br>been before have heard me Ranch about<br>this but I thought it' be interesting<br>especially for younger practitioners how<br>I've changed very much uh my priorities<br>and and how I am as a practitioner like<br>when I first started I wanted to just do<br>little jobs um H individual houses and<br>then do all of these troublemaking<br>polemics like political things that just<br>poked and proded um so I did lots of<br>things like parliaments that move so you<br>can mess with uh the parliamentarians<br>and um buildings that unfold into like<br>over laneways and then um you could can<br>dismantle them back if somebody like<br>from Council comes to check it out or<br>messing with the economics of apartment<br>buildings what happens if it's<br>constantly reshuffling all day every day<br>while you're at work so you had the<br>penthouse one day and the ground floor<br>the next using military infrastructure<br>to go and bomb people that need housing<br>um especially during floods you know<br>just these stupid ideas that I had so<br>much fun with um uh looking at land<br>Bankers the endless Fury to this day<br>about people just you know sitting on<br>land and letting it appreciate and just<br>and lending you know just helping the<br>the housing crisis along and then<br>actually creating these these sort of<br>playgrounds you just go and dump on<br>their land um to actually try and<br>activate it and pull down the fences or<br>um uh you know giant suburb eating<br>robots that go and reclaim resources<br>from the abandoned suburbs after the<br>peak oil hits so these are all really<br>fun while at the same time just working<br>with some great melburnians and and<br>other within other states as well um<br>deliberately keeping it small and simple<br>and you know I started my practice at<br>the same time that you know my son came<br>into this world so having a little Bub<br>on the desk and then mucking around and<br>keeping things really simple and cheap<br>uh as well I don't come from like I come<br>from tazzy like I don't come from a<br>privileged background so just pay the<br>bills play with you know work on these<br>things um and it's just been really fun<br>but over time getting busier and busier<br>as we get more popular um<br>and it's just got to a point over time<br>where you know 20 years A lot's changed<br>so we've gone from going gee houses are<br>expensive gee there's a lot of carbon in<br>the air to there is a housing crisis you<br>know we're actually cooking the Earth uh<br>about time to stop playing with these<br>ideas and actually start to roll up our<br>sleeves and do something more but we've<br>been having fun with these single res um<br>this is old data and you all know it<br>anyway but it's really interesting when<br>you look at the affordability scale thre<br>is um considered unaffordable you know<br>5.1 severely unaffordable and then when<br>you look at our three cities Melbourne<br>Sydney and Oakland look at that<br>Oakland's you know basically double<br>severely unaffordable so it's severely<br> one would say in ter um and we're<br>in the similar boat it's it's changed<br>around a bit I think this is about 5<br>years old but you get it nothing's<br>changed if anything things have gotten<br>worse um you know housing crisis growing<br>homelessness I just can't believe we see<br>this in Melbourne like it just blows my<br>mind and of course the world's on fire<br>um and we know the solution or a big<br>part of the solution with the built<br>environment adding 40% of our carbon um<br>sort of<br>footprint we know that the solution is<br>density but as a young practitioner I've<br>I've really resisted it for a long time<br>um because I would have developers come<br>and and they identified really early on<br>that we had a quite a popular brand but<br>there was probably a lot of people that<br>couldn't afford a single home from us<br>but they could probably you know get<br>enough debt to secure an apartment so<br>they would come to us and they would say<br>hey come and do an apartment building<br>I'd be like yes this is awesome like<br>let's house some people and then I'd<br>come out with all of these ideas and<br>they'd be like don't do don't just stop<br>it all we want is your brand and then<br>you do the stuff you enjoy which is do<br>the pretty stuff on the outside the<br>spreadsheets will take care of the rest<br>and so it just said No Time and Time and<br>Time again and then I was sort of<br>thinking about um the pical stuff we<br>were doing which is just Naval gazing<br>like hute you know attention seeking<br>stuff really um and constantly bitching<br>about somebody needs to do something<br>about the state of Housing and then<br>having Mark Aon saying wear somebody<br>like maybe shut up and let's do<br>something about it um and so we decided<br>to do our own we'd never done multi-res<br>um and we decided to put on the hat not<br>only the multi-res architect but also as<br>the developer so we wanted those to have<br>some key principles which were they had<br>to be deliberative design so we took our<br>skills of working with individual<br>clients and we spoke to a community<br>about what they felt was important um it<br>had to tackle climate change it had to<br>be an Exemplar of good urbanism and<br>contribute something back to the built<br>fabric it had to have Financial uh<br>sustainability uh in terms of uh the<br>cost effecting risks of it being built<br>but also the ongoing running cost and we<br>wanted to democratize Capital we wanted<br>to stop going to the big four banks in<br>Australia and all of their sort of<br>investment in fossil fuel um to pause<br>that though I'll just talk about the<br>U-turn that I've made um in recent years<br>I just don't talk to Architects as much<br>anymore we are an amazing group that can<br>get in our own little Silo our own<br>little bubble and have this reinforcing<br>um sort of discussion a lot and what I<br>found um especially with the help of<br>others is like um is is have<br>conversations outwardly like we have so<br>much to offer um and the big takeaways<br>there were I'm going to stop I'm going<br>to get out into the world like it's<br>really like Melbourne's got this<br>so much fun brilliant click of great<br>Architects it's really Collegiate and<br>all that but let's go outwards to try<br>and solve some of these problems and<br>rejecting Ary speak is something I've<br>always tried to do because it is a way<br>where Architects sort of fortify their<br>position it was a reaction to the Master<br>Builders we will actually go and create<br>this level of language that mystifies<br>people so we seem much smarter than them<br>there's a great quotee that I usually<br>have in here but get rid of Ary speak so<br>we actually uh not only well it's down<br>there communicating with the public we<br>not only arm uh tell the public what's<br>important about what we do but we arm<br>them with the real knowledge of why it's<br>important um stop creating polemics it's<br>just not that helpful really and I was<br>doing a lot of reading of Peter Singer<br>and and you know I just realized I<br>should be just doing more projects<br>earning more money and then giving away<br>10% of it like that would solve so many<br>problems um buying bed Nets one year um<br>uh I gave away a chunk of cash and and<br>it bought all these bed nets um and uh<br>it's just amazing how something like<br>that that just was spare change really<br>um saves so many lives so stop doing<br>that kind of thing actually just build<br>stuff um and as I said before clear<br>simple language empowering the lady<br>person not only with the knowledge but<br>their ability to talk about design as<br>well we've seen it with grand designs<br>that's you know I I was lucky to start<br>my practice when I did because Grand<br>designs was educating people in the<br>tumultuous nature of engaging with the<br>process um and it'll all be okay at the<br>end most of the time um but also the<br>value of that of of good design and<br>that's where Kev and I started doing<br>this as well just Kev just like just<br>such a nerd for architecture he's like<br>all I all I want to do is go and look at<br>buildings that's all I want to do but<br>I'm broke all the time and I was just<br>like dude just just run tours and do<br>videos and he said do you want to help<br>me and I was like yep um and I'm sort of<br>I pr pride myself in being a travel<br>vampire if any of my mates going<br>anywhere cool I'm like where are you<br>going what flight are you on and then I<br>just get on that<br>plane um and so we try to make videos<br>that are doing two things they're<br>talking to the general public but<br>they're also talking to students because<br>we're finding that there is a generation<br>of students I'll say in Melbourne I<br>don't know whether it's familiar here<br>that don't know what's going on they're<br>learning this this process of like um I<br>turn up I pin up on the wall a bunch of<br>people punch the out of me I get<br>emotional I walk nothing what got went<br>in and then I go home and I stare at a<br>laptop and go what's what's going on and<br>I'm talking about people people tell us<br>that anecdotally right up the fifth year<br>like I've done 5 years of this and I'm<br>about to go out and I don't I think I've<br>learned this game I haven't learned what<br>I need to learn that's what they're<br>telling us so we try to help out a<br>little bit and bring things right back<br>to First principles and then take people<br>on tours and again that that idea of the<br>Instagram image you know the evocative<br>image taking that away and actually<br>saying come and stand get at a human<br>scale it's Al Alto thing what happens at<br>this scale is the most important thing<br>everything else is just industry um and<br>pointing at things uh using layman's<br>terms getting people to touch materials<br>look at the way materials touch each<br>other look at the way buildings<br>interface with public space with private<br>space and people just learned so much<br>and the great thing about this is now<br>there are people from all over the world<br>um and there's lay people as well at we<br>had Kevin from Florida who's he rides<br>horses show jumping he like what are you<br>doing here and he's like a I love your<br>channel and B I love architecture and<br>it's like that's awesome because it the<br>discussions that happened on that last<br>tour were epic because they were not<br>just like cuz we got this really great<br>mix where students graduates and then<br>people like at who are running massive<br>amazing firms that discussion's really<br>good but then when you get Outsiders as<br>well um it changes language there was<br>also r that um is a nurse and she's<br>coming on our next one to Scandinavia in<br>in June like she's a nurse she just<br>saves up to come on Ary Marathon tours<br>now it's awesome um and the places Kev<br>gets its into is<br>amazing and I tried to think about it<br>too much or look too much I just you<br>know sort of go take us Kev and then we<br>turn up somewhere like this and it's<br>like holy I never thought I'd get<br>to see<br>this um and then also so this comes back<br>to education this is how uh I studied<br>and I was really On The Fringe of the<br>new technology coming in and 3D<br>technology and all all of that but I<br>always understood that architectural<br>education happened here in the studio<br>that's where the education happened<br>that's where the ideas sunk in that's<br>where the debate the negotiation the<br>testing of ideas the challenge of ideas<br>happened and then you would go to a<br>lecture to be pulled you know sort of to<br>have this o big world view and then you<br>would go into a crit as to be able to<br>articulate everything that was being<br>talked about there<br>so and I just hear now that it's all<br>it's about go do your crit or go do your<br>presentation get the kicked out of<br>you and then go to a lecture which you<br>don't quite understand and I just think<br>well the most important bit is is<br>missing out of that and I understand how<br>it happened and in Australia it's John<br>Howard's fault defunding universities<br>and all that and this real estate's<br>really important and of course Co kills<br>it even further but what we decided to<br>do this is the other half of our office<br>AMA is on one side and Kev is on that<br>side and we just decided to set up a<br>studio that's God cells rmit design Hub<br>um over the road um and we just said you<br>know to students come and hang out here<br>kev's always here you can sort of listen<br>vicariously learn through hearing AMA<br>doing their thing which everybody's<br>disappointed about because we are head<br>down bum up not really talking um and uh<br>and then just constantly like getting<br>people to draw things get off the<br>laptops and we've got students here from<br>every University in Melbourne so you get<br>this Cross polonization of ideas and<br>that's how good ideas are born is by<br>getting many voices involved<br>and it's been really successful and it's<br>just growing more and more we have these<br>events too which is awesome um there's<br>this great group called yimi in um in<br>Melbourne that's all about yesing my<br>backyard that's really trying to get<br>good housing policy in place and they<br>come and use the space every Sunday as<br>well and the students are 24/7 so they<br>can come and overhear those sorts of<br>meetings we have our own design meetings<br>AMA do on that big whiteboard as well so<br>they can hear that and some of them even<br>throw in their two cents and what what<br>do you think of this idea and I always<br>say shut up um<br>but hopefully they're learning through<br>that<br>process um anyway so that's that's<br>happening as well but back to which is<br>fun and awesome um because building<br>buildings can be really really hard<br>anybody in the industry knows that<br>you're just pushing uphill a lot of<br>the time that uh you um buildings don't<br>want to be be built like it's the second<br>law of Thermodynamics like we are in a<br>universi is going to entropy that is in<br>Decay we're trying to reverse that by<br>building things it's so hard so I'm like<br>high five to anybody that's built a<br>building as terrible as they may be cuz<br>it's amaz it's amazing that we actually<br>do it um but so we decided to do this<br>going back we decided to do some<br>housing triple bottom line housing um<br>and everybody knows what that means but<br>I'll point it out anyway this is typical<br>development is maximize your financial<br>returns because it's a business and just<br>do whatever you need to do in<br>sustainability and livability um to tick<br>the legislative boxes it's just about<br>giving all three of those equal priority<br>so Financial returns um because there's<br>investors sustainability and livability<br>uh and we went to all of our past<br>clients and said hey we've built you<br>really nice houses and you guys rock and<br>the value of property's gone up so much<br>do you want to each Kick in a 100 Grand<br>and we're amazed most of them were like<br>yeah you know if we're going to help<br>House people let's do it so we raised 2<br>million bucks even uh Leon van shik<br>who's like the Grand Daddy of of of sort<br>of Melbourne architecture was the head<br>of rmit for a long time he threw in<br>money which was amazing as a voter<br>confidence and some of our staff threw<br>in money as well to fund this<br>development which is super surprising<br>cuz I do not pay them enough money for<br>them to do that so I've docked most of<br>their wages since um and we found a<br>great land owner who lived in Brunswick<br>ran his business in Brunswick and he<br>could have sold up for more and he<br>wanted to stay there so he owns one of<br>the apartments now um and he wanted to<br>be proud of what he did instead of just<br>cashing in he wanted to be part of the<br>solution rather than seeing what<br>everybody else was doing was selling up<br>to ruthless developers and the gray<br>concrete boxes going<br>up um so in terms of this building you<br>know Apartments have to face outwards<br>from the site not in towards each other<br>I'll skip through this really quickly um<br>the Saxon street is a really troubled<br>Street there's been it's got a really<br>checked terrible history um uh violence<br>against women in the street is just<br>phenomenal it's happened in the past um<br>and the idea of actually activating that<br>street getting not having cars there not<br>having a garage door actually you know<br>having passive surveillance educating<br>the counciling why you shouldn't have<br>setbacks because you want as many people<br>as possible looking down the street the<br>the crazy we have to argue with<br>planners um but also looking at the<br>context like you know so many of these<br>sort of the these great uh sort of<br>Italian and Greek Legacy houses are<br>being knocked down because they not seem<br>to have any value in Melbourne um and<br>then looking up and down Sydney Road<br>which this building will be on<br>predominantly two stories lots of<br>different strange archers and instead of<br>doing that which is happening everywhere<br>through Melbourne which is just a<br>generic godamn box trying to have a<br>conversation like this is two stories<br>versus you know six stories but actually<br>trying to have a bit of conversation and<br>bring in some Greenery because<br>Brunswick's famous for not having any<br>trees all those wonderful Greek and<br>Italian people just cutting them down<br>and putting concrete that is verging on<br>racism I apologize um<br>uh but the cool thing about this process<br>was getting to know the people first<br>actually saying to people AMA is going<br>to do a project here who's who's up and<br>then getting these people together and<br>we had lots of delays we end up with<br>vcap which is like you know boom and n's<br>next store complaining and holding us up<br>and taking us to court and all that and<br>so many of these people just stuck along<br>with us the whole way and they told us<br>what they valued and we pumped that into<br>the design which is awesome especially<br>when you do go and argue with Council<br>and they say can you just set that back<br>because you go well okay that's like<br>that's R's apartment you've just deleted<br>and you actually say to rou in that<br>meeting how do you feel about that<br>you're now homeless<br>so um and the big thing for us with this<br>building is you know the the the hous<br>like the the the problem for first home<br>buyers is so significant you're always<br>tempted to make them as cheap as<br>possible in this one we we wanted to<br>make really good siiz homes because we<br>knew a lot of people wanted to have<br>growing families in there and we're so<br>proud that none of these for how how<br>many years been four four years three<br>three and a bit um nobody sold up and<br>moved out which some of the Nightingale<br>stuff that we were doing earlier on uh<br>you know people would wait their one<br>year out so to avoid their tax<br>implications and sell up and make 200<br>Grand overnight um people are raising<br>their kids here and because of that it's<br>fortifying the community even more which<br>is awesome but what we found with our 20<br>apartments that we did a Terrace House<br>is people that didn't want apartments at<br>all like we do not want that um and we<br>can't afford that and we hate the<br>ongoing maintenance and we probably need<br>to renovate it like it's just impossible<br>and so we came out just saying well<br>we're going to we're going to do Terrace<br>houses the thing that you kind of want<br>to buy but you don't want the<br>maintenance and and all that and then<br>you can have your shared costs shared<br>internet costs shared power costs and<br>that comes from the site because the<br>site's only 10 m wide by 57 M long and<br>we called this uh inde defense of<br>corridors because that's what good<br>housers have actually have thoughtful<br>corridors um you know this is what's<br>called an efficient apartment a good<br>that's a good apartment essentially but<br>they're considered efficient because<br>they you get two bedrooms at a much you<br>know lower square meters of apartment<br>and we're basically paying for every<br>square meter um everything's down at<br>square meter rates our site kind of<br>forced our hand a bit and we just went<br>with it and no developer would do this<br>would be creating these massive<br>apartments and we sold them so far under<br>Market because we' stripped out the vast<br>majority of the profit um but if you<br>look at this standard typical efficient<br>apartment there is a corridor that's a<br>goddamn Corridor they're just calling it<br>living space and not only that you're<br>trying to put your kids to bed and<br>you're trying to watch the TV at the<br>same time it's a nightmare like that's<br>that's a short-term Solution that's<br>where all you're doing is get is putting<br>some debt somewhere to wait for that to<br>appreciate so you can leverage off it to<br>get your next property the real property<br>we weren't interested in being part of<br>that but St Corridor and then the other<br>thing too is you can't sell Shar like<br>shared corridors you want to make those<br>as small as possible because you can<br>only sell the apartment everything else<br>comes as a cost to the to the<br>development so that's why we see all of<br>these places places where you don't want<br>to you feel like you're going to be<br>killed and you don't want to stop and<br>talk to your neighbors like this is the<br>worst place in the world like and you<br>just grunt at your neighbors and move on<br>and what we did again no developer would<br>do this is we tease them apart to create<br>this Zone in between so that people felt<br>comfortable being at each other's front<br>door the other great thing is we only<br>have four apartments on each level so<br>instead of all of those doors we've just<br>got too many people sharing one tight<br>Corridor you've only got four families<br>and the other thing we did was put um<br>study spaces at the front door so you<br>think about the typical Terrace House<br>you come in the front door bedroom<br>bathroom bedroom then there's living<br>space and you all go in that front door<br>and you try look in those bedrooms don't<br>you like admit it you try to have a<br>sticky beak in the bedrooms so and then<br>there's this whole sort of hierarchy of<br>social engagement where if you say to<br>somebody in that Arrangement come hang<br>out with me you've got to take them<br>through the apartment Lobby and<br>everything up through the stair or lift<br>all the way past your private spaces<br>into that into your Lounge room to hang<br>out they're suddenly in charge they've<br>got the power like it's really hard to<br>then say can you go now like I just want<br>to have a chat and now you're in my<br>space this idea of putting the apartment<br>the the the office right on that social<br>space right next to the front door<br>creates what we would trying to create<br>which is a big problem for most<br>Australians we think the front Vera like<br>you look at that and you've got this<br>shared Central space and because there's<br>only four doors even though they haven't<br>paid for it those sort of walkways that<br>go to the front door become their<br>Verandas and they've become occupied<br>occupied with those great stuff and<br>stuff they didn't that space they didn't<br>pay for it's really brutal as simple<br>sort of space so we didn't pay extra for<br>it and then we put those study spaces<br>with Windows in them so they can all be<br>kind of like hi how you going or pull<br>down the Blind and be like off I<br>don't want to talk to you today or<br>whatever it is but there's an actual and<br>and the social engagement then is much<br>more uh informal and you can Retreat the<br>front yard does that really well for us<br>and people in Australia I'm sure here as<br>well there's something great about the<br>power Dynamic there oh hi margerie great<br>to see you sort of thing and there<br>boundaries in between you can be really<br>social and be like I think I can hear<br>that you know the CLE or the kid you can<br>disappear and so we wanted we we're<br>always trying to bring this into all of<br>our work but especially for apartments<br>cuz culturally I think it's the only way<br>we can stop people from going Apartments<br>house and you know I'm really proud of<br>what we've done there at Terrace house<br>and get these great interactions and<br>it's also the personalities that we<br>attracted like Paul and Fitz that you<br>can see the two kids up there they're<br>just like the most lovable people and<br>the front door is directly below them so<br>they're just always out there going hi<br>hi hi gets a bit annoying but it's good<br>um had one resident that came up to me<br>two weeks there' being in the building<br>came up to me just fu ious and she going<br>mayard it takes me to get from this<br>front gate to my door it takes me 40<br>minutes because everybody's stopping<br>there's always these little places to<br>you we've strategically put like look<br>how cheap that is but strategically<br>there's a bench seat out the front of<br>the gate and on the sort of secure side<br>of the gate next to lift there's a bench<br>as well there's always a place to stop<br>and perge and people just find<br>themselves going he's got me again<br>like he's forced me to stop and talk to<br>my neighbors no I didn't like you're<br>just a nice person<br>um and look how simple all of that is<br>like so you think about the typical<br>developer render and the people having<br>Cafe lattes and you know expensive this<br>and that we all know and it's just like<br>the bus shelter good design comes from<br>really thoughtful interaction with<br>people and their emotions and their<br>basic needs and if you can think about<br>that you can solve some pretty big<br>issues look at it it's just so raw and<br>and and simple if you want people to use<br>sustainable transport put the bikes<br>right near the front door don't put them<br>in a basement if you want people to use<br>the stairs make sure that as you walk in<br>you can actually see the stairs not the<br>lift so they might take that as as a way<br>to go up and down um we we kicked one<br>the youngest person living there we we<br>paid to create these Graphics cuz it's<br>just a fire stare that we put GL glass<br>on one side um to give it a bit of life<br>and we made it as sustainable as<br>possible 8.2 Stars navs massive um<br>incredible air tightness it's basically<br>passive house level without sort of the<br>the onerous last sort of<br>10% no heating or Cooling in in the<br>building there's no air conditioner<br>there's no heating it's Erv so we're<br>constantly doing energy recovery<br>constantly moving fresh air through this<br>building we're doing heat exchange so<br>you're not losing much energy um in<br>summer the sprinklers uh the the the<br>misers drop sort of the the temperature<br>of those um those light Wells by about<br>10° and that's where we bring all of the<br>air in to go into those ervs so you<br>constantly in summer bringing in cooler<br>air um no heating or Cooling and our<br>amazing we had a German um uh energy<br>consultant and he just did all the<br>calculations on how much the fridge CU<br>we got Fisher and pel to help us out<br>with stuff and how much energy they<br>produce how much the standard TV the<br>human body and they were really<br>confident that in winter cold Melbourne<br>winter there would be enough energy<br>pumping into this and look at the power<br>bills so most of the cost is meterage so<br>you compare that to the average in<br>Victoria $137<br>um per month that's the average so<br>ongoing affordability in terms of<br>running costs is incredible we use far<br>less concrete I could talk about this<br>for ages but we had a great Builder<br>where we really thought about getting so<br>much of that carbon out of the concrete<br>process we originally wanted to be CLT<br>but we just couldn't make it happen<br>because of the fire RS um the Builder<br>offset all the construction process<br>which was brilliant uh it's all electric<br>um we did external uh sun protection you<br>just have to do that cuz this building<br>faces east west but we did that on the<br>outside of the balcony so when it's down<br>you're not just internalized you're<br>actually capturing that outdoor space<br>low V materials Master switches all of<br>it's thought about in such a a massive<br>way um and then just you know no cars um<br>I'm not a no car person like cars are<br>really important to especially people<br>that are very disadvantaged or single<br>parents things like that but it's about<br>good um urbanism this is this area has<br>just got so much public transport in it<br>and it meant that we could then not have<br>the garage door we could activate the<br>street um I love this thatat so the<br>carbon impact compared to a St develop a<br>standard typical building of this scale<br>100 million balloons of CO2 removed from<br>the atmosphere over the life of the<br>building is what it's estimated to be ah<br>stoked um<br>anyway I'm not watching time so Andrew<br>you'll kick me off when I go too long<br>keep going<br>um so that yep can you tell us about the<br>um what many of our clients are<br>surprised about we we're bloody<br>rationalists they expect us like in<br>their first few meetings be all like<br>woohoo and we're like this is the<br>planning code and this is the sun this<br>is how and so these are all planned<br>incredibly rationally I I could talk<br>about this building forever uh in terms<br>of all of the bedrooms all the bathrooms<br>um the kitchen all line up vertically<br>straight through the building so there's<br>Mass efficiency there but because of the<br>setbacks you'll get slightly different<br>um Living Spaces and we took that<br>efficiency to the roof as well where we<br>knew two of the families wanted three<br>bedroom homes so On th those ones<br>they've got exactly the same plan but<br>where there's sort of some cupboard<br>space that we put in the corridor that<br>becomes a stair and then we just put<br>these little you know AMA you know<br>little cute sort of Shacks on top and<br>that becomes the master bedroom up there<br>but um<br>yeah but there's only two three Bs in<br>the the in the mix of 20 homes so you<br>can live this dream on top of your yeah<br>yeah I really wanted to put a Hills<br>interested and that took us to park life<br>um which is part of the The Village um<br>so uh a whole bunch of us getting<br>together so CLA next door to us CLA<br>cousins hael breathe architecture<br>architecture Kennedy nand you you guys<br>probably all studied this it's been very<br>popular um and we got to do the biggest<br>building there um 36 Apartments um and<br>again just like the Terrace house<br>actually have a look at the context and<br>just like the the Greek and Italian sort<br>of Legacy houses the things that people<br>consider not of value until typically<br>until there's a generational change and<br>people go holy I love those when I<br>was a kid where have they all gone so<br>just looking at what we were knocking<br>down of bringing that into the language<br>of the building and also the scale of<br>the building using it in very AMA ways<br>that we've been doing for 20 years<br>getting big things and breaking down<br>into like an accretion of<br>masses um and doing what we often do<br>which is deal with levels of<br>transparency as well um to create a<br>building this one to Ducket street so to<br>the South where we have some<br>setbacks and then of course the<br>inevitable arguments with Council I've<br>for 20 years I've had this saying I<br>always say in the office work with the<br>problem rather than against it like no<br>room for Tantrums like if it's a thing<br>and it's not ideal how do we turn into<br>something awesome and um one of those<br>things is is that Amphitheater up on the<br>corner which I'll come back to levels of<br>transparency you know the bird cages<br>stuff like this we were really worried<br>about whether people would like it but<br>the great thing about deliberative<br>design is we can really talk to these<br>people we know who they are before<br>they've even signed a sales contract<br>like are you okay with this look you get<br>far less um bastra and great view back<br>to the city and all that<br>in Terrace House you probably notice<br>that this in between space had handrails<br>and we were like everybody just move in<br>there and like put couches there and<br>tables and stuff and of course as soon<br>as you put a couch or a table next to a<br>ballustrade that ballustrade is no<br>longer compliant and if you got a<br>building full of kids they jump up and<br>down on the couches six stories up and<br>you're like um and so here we just<br>use the netting straight through so you<br>can just you um a bit<br>safer we learn um there's six doors on<br>each of these Landings so there's a<br>little bit more shared space around<br>these Verandas as I call them and that's<br>Claire's building Clair cousins building<br>on that side um and that's the West out<br>there so you get these if you follow any<br>of us online you've probably seen these<br>incredible uh sunsets coming roaring<br>through there it's<br>epic um so basically with Park life it's<br>a North building and a south building um<br>which is just like Terrace House where<br>it was an east and west building with<br>this in between space um and that in<br>between space being that social space<br>again instead of that dodgy Corridor but<br>the great thing about working together<br>with other people so each of the<br>Architects we were the Architects on our<br>buildings but we were also just like the<br>Terrace House model were the developers<br>of each of those buildings so CLA was<br>pretty much doing our own building we<br>we' agreed shared services and things<br>like that so we're sharing like the<br>internet and all of the services and the<br>solar and um eded energy network but<br>stuff like this it's amazing how it<br>seems really straightforward like let's<br>line up our our um our light Wells so we<br>got much bigger light Wells and her<br>sight was much thinner than ours and it<br>just messed with her plan so much so<br>this turned into just like weeks of us<br>rejigging each other's plans to try and<br>line up light Wells best intentions when<br>it comes down to dirty reality is so you<br>just see why you know a standard profit<br>driven developer their business people<br>will just be I don't give a like<br>just move on you got to compant like<br>well tick um and then the northern<br>facade which typically we have to do one<br>of these ugly setbacks but because we<br>decided to save Allan the tree there we<br>actually gave up 3 m of space and we<br>went to council and said we could either<br>get rid of that pull our bottom facade<br>out give you your three-story Street<br>wall set back and then you don't have<br>passive surveillance it's a northern<br>facade you don't want to have setbacks<br>anyway uh thank God they went yes please<br>keep that tree and we're now trying to<br>do this with other de develop like this<br>is in every bit of sort of government<br>literature now about an Exemplar and<br>every time we propose a six or seven um<br>story wall next to a park we're going<br>through this at the moment are we like<br>they're like no where's your street wall<br>and we're like our building in your<br>documents says that's an Exemplar and<br>yet we have to do<br>like welcome to my world um that's clear<br>two of our staff brought into this<br>building as well so like and it's which<br>is awesome that's the commons um uh in<br>the background there so by breath<br>architecture that started off so much of<br>like build it and they will come<br>somebody's got to build it um these<br>these ideas for people to sort of invest<br>in them or or understand they're<br>worthwhile uh borrowing from M mvrdv and<br>instead of trying to detail everything<br>really tightly just saying to the trades<br>put it where it needs to go to it to an<br>extent like it's not really fair to Mark<br>Austin and Mark strandon who are out on<br>site all day just like don't put it<br>there um but essentially keep it loose<br>so we really drive down the the labor<br>costs and tie it all together by<br>painting it the same color um uh and<br>other things too like everybody else was<br>fighting so hard for these Florida<br>ceiling glazing like you look at<br>Claire's and it's just it's really<br>beautiful but we got we ended up with<br>9.1 star nathers here like it's<br>considered the most sustainable<br>apartment building this particular one<br>in the village uh in Australia um and we<br>we calculated how much glass was you<br>know would give us the best thermal<br>outcome it seems a weird way to design<br>and then we designed amount of glass in<br>like there was an economy of glass and<br>so we ended up with Just 2 is that I<br>think it's 2.4 and we just did this<br>detail across and everybody that lives<br>there bloody loves it they're like it's<br>just love pot plants and everything like<br>that up and it's just the perfect amount<br>of light so it was good feedback that<br>maybe sometimes sort of the the the<br>perfect architectural idea of you know<br>isn't exactly what is people want or<br>need in their life and you can get some<br>other winds in some other<br>ways um the really interesting things<br>too about both of these communities is<br>we were asking them like what kind of<br>AMA stuff do you want and they were like<br>just just take it easy like they it was<br>really good it was actually exciting can<br>we like we can do all this stuff with<br>the Cabinetry and they're like keep it<br>white like we'll come and bring our<br>lives and put it into this like just<br>create a canvas for us I love it it took<br>the pressure off too so instead of<br>having to decorate too much it was like<br>okay we just make it<br>work um and so all of the shared spaces<br>are like this yellow going through it um<br>and then the ampy theater was where we<br>had more two more houses um and the<br>council said just get rid of those two<br>houses so we've got um so it lines up<br>with the building next door and we're<br>like why and they're like cuz it's a<br>theme we like lining up with stuff and<br>it's like doesn't matter the whole<br>Street's doing this this is what healthy<br>streets do and again instead of fighting<br>we just went all right and we showed<br>them the maths you just put up<br>everybody's apartment like we have to<br>pay for this loss of yield you just put<br>up everybody's apartment by $40,000 it's<br>like no we didn't we just wanted to setb<br>like the the cognitive dissidence of<br>like the actions that Council Force<br>versus the loss of yield so what it does<br>to affordability and also we're<br>increasing surface area there so you're<br>getting more surface area to lose um<br>that exposes sort of the thermal mass of<br>the building no we just want our setback<br>and so instead of throwing a tantrum and<br>instead of going screw it we'll just put<br>Color Bond in on there and we lose this<br>one we spent a little bit extra and we<br>turned it into something and thank God<br>the community loves it cuz it was also a<br>bit of a gamble what if they didn't use<br>this but there's been weddings and stuff<br>there a few of the people in the<br>building turn up every morning and have<br>a cup of coffee there and chat um so<br>beautiful uh 9.1 Stars again the only<br>building in the village with no heating<br>uh no cooling the same we learned so we<br>tried to we tried to do so many things<br>in uh in terce house<br>you know what it's like you know in the<br>what's that quote in the in the amateurs<br>mind there are endless possibilities in<br>the experts there are a few very few<br>possibilities like it's great actually<br>going we tried all that stuff and<br>almost went broke here we're going to<br>try five things and do them really well<br>um and it just made a better building<br>don't tell the people that live in<br>Terrace house that I said don't let them<br>know I said that<br>um and the cool thing about this<br>building and again no other we had an<br>entirely different sustainability<br>strategy<br>um than the other uh five buildings and<br>that's that we try to get rid of the<br>concrete so we we used this insulated<br>panel um which gave us you know it's<br>basically an elaborate esy and we didn't<br>have concrete blade walls instead it was<br>just a post and plank sort of system um<br>but anyway the other good thing is<br>across the village we had 20% affordable<br>housing awesome um and that was housing<br>choices and so teaming up with the<br>housing provider and carbon neutral in<br>operation um and with the village that<br>sort of concludes the original<br>Nightingale um and was during that<br>process of the village there was some<br>ugliness that happened uh and our<br>founding CEO Jesse left um as well as a<br>few few others of us um but the legacy<br>is really important that that she and<br>many of us that aren't involved in<br>anymore uh have left but this idea of<br>you know having that triple bottom line<br>and making something replic that you can<br>repeat<br>um look at the Legacy so nting G one by<br>Breathe um nting g 2 by<br>6° uh you've got bronswick East um which<br>is by CHC and Sophie who now runs AMA<br>actually that she was a developer she<br>was client side she actually uh this was<br>her project so as a developer rolling up<br>a sleeves and and and delivering<br>sustainable cost-effective housing it's<br>it is and of course because of inflation<br>it is and will forever be the most coste<br>effective n Gale that was ever built<br>uh Terrace House started its life as a<br>nightingale until the ugliness and then<br>we pulled it um and you know Regional<br>areas as well so breath did one in<br>Ballarat as well which is cool um but it<br>did what it was meant to do so nting<br>Gale housing you know Del we always<br>talked about it being the disruptor not<br>the answer like the biggest part of the<br>original Nightingale was to educate<br>Architects so actually get us to instead<br>of being utopian and saying this is the<br>way things should be is to actually get<br>dirty and realize how Bloody hard it is<br>um and deliberative design actually get<br>involved with people and ask what they<br>want instead of a real estate agent<br>telling you what the market wants um and<br>related to that but more important and<br>this is the greatest Legacy is imp<br>empowering purchasers to demand more<br>giving knowledge about what a good house<br>and a good apartment is and then going<br>out into the marketplace and just saying<br>when a real estate agent says two<br>bedrooms two bathrooms be like yeah but<br>what is it energy rating like has it got<br>an embedded Network and what is its<br>communal spaces like um that was the<br>whole purpose of the original<br>Nightingale and we always said and I can<br>remember Jeremy saying it many times<br>like in 10 years hopefully we can just<br>fold the whole thing and it can<br>disappear um it's turned into something<br>else that's Now using that name and you<br>know trying to leverage off the village<br>but it's a it's now a developer but the<br>cool thing is that all so the<br>development manager hit versus hype<br>these brilliant people were so<br>fundamental to how we set up the<br>original Nightingale uh and they were<br>the development managers of of one and<br>two um we're working with them now to do<br>Park Life 2 which is just Next Level we<br>got some 10 star homes in there um it's<br>between two parks so park Life 2 because<br>it's between two parks the other Park<br>life got one park and I've created this<br>tagline um twice the park twice the life<br>and now we're really leveraging on the<br>whole 80s thing like the the sequels are<br>always better like Empire Strikes Back<br>am I right<br>um and so and thank God that HP versus<br>Hive it's really their project we're<br>just being engaged as The Architects on<br>on here that they're really into it<br>um this one I'm incredibly proud of and<br>it's probably you know it's it's more<br>useful in many ways like we talk about<br>the missing middle I don't know whether<br>you say use that term here but in<br>Melbourne you know it's just rings of<br>suburbs what do we do about how do we<br>get density into predominantly single<br>story<br>freestanding homes um this was by Lucent<br>who again s was Lucent back in the day<br>um client side this was the last project<br>we did with Sophie until we stole her<br>away and now she's the managing director<br>of AMA um and this is really interesting<br>because you know they helped so much<br>with us in terms of professionalizing<br>the way that we did development um uh<br>Panos from Lucen um who was sof's<br>business partner helped us secure um the<br>building contract for the Village um and<br>uh they they said this is cool you're<br>doing all this stuff in<br>Brunswick you guys have been to<br>Brunswick most people yeah no it's not<br>that good um it's cheap um and I see<br>nodding over there like yeah sucks<br>um and so they came to us saying we've<br>got to do something about Millennial<br>Southside migration I actually use the<br>term Refugee um like what do we do about<br>all these people it's so expensive south<br>of Melbourne that there's a there's a<br>couple of generations that are like by<br>Mom by dad like I'm moving to Brunswick<br>or Preston I'm moving North and the<br>reality is they're doing that because<br>it's cheaper and we're trying to provide<br>a product in Brunswick because we we<br>could get cheaper land prices um to<br>provide this housing so the great risky<br>thing for ostensibly a traditional<br>developer that wanted to I think the<br>tagline was leave it better than you<br>found it can we bring those ideas down<br>to Brighton where it is incredibly<br>conservative area politically incredibly<br>conservative area everybody said no<br>nobody will be interested in that they<br>just want luxury whatever that means um<br>so many bad examples in that area of<br>just the generic boxes going in um and<br>if you look from 2009 versus today all<br>of those have been development sites<br>which where it was predominantly single<br>story homes and just these same gray<br>concrete boxes going up and so the nimes<br>the locals getting really up in arms<br>Council getting very defensive and we<br>our site was right next to one of the<br>most important cardinia house one of the<br>most important um Heritage homes in the<br>area um great heritage in the area so we<br>agree the idea of just more generic<br>concrete boxes going up is wrong but we<br>do need density so we went to council<br>and said that's what you're expecting us<br>to do and they're like yeah we know we<br>need density but please don't do that um<br>and we said well look like but but how<br>do you do bigness they're saying in a<br>place where there isn't bigness and we<br>said you do have bigness like there are<br>Anglican Catholic there are multiple<br>churches many churches in this area that<br>have a scale that basically fits with<br>your planning code and we said what<br>we're going to bring that<br>scale here so essentially we're not<br>there isn't an argument about bigness<br>versus single story like cuz we're just<br>using and of course I know a lot of<br>students get pissed off by where's your<br>site analysis site analysis and<br>responding to something concrete is<br>where the good ideas come from yeah like<br>actually digging in and going what is<br>here mining that is so often where you<br>can do something meaningful instead of<br>just Landing a<br>spaceship um and so we went to council<br>and they were just like holy to go<br>just go and it was the easiest planning<br>it's not quite true but it's the story I<br>like to tell it was the easiest planning<br>process and so we turned two homes into<br>14 sustainable fossil fuel free all that<br>all these things that people like the<br>market won't want that they want their<br>gas burners<br>um and then just showing ccel these like<br>that's your maximum height limit if you<br>think about overshadowing and visual<br>bulk and things like that if we tune<br>those down and we cut through some<br>circulation and we add some fenestration<br>they love to say but balconies and<br>articulation um then essentially we've<br>got a scale that is like the church in<br>the areas but it also is essentially<br>your built planning code you know are<br>you going to get in the way or not um<br>they did a bit that's their job um<br>and so we did 14 houses yeah 8.2 Stars<br>again yeah fossil fuel free 15 K kilow<br>of solar all the good stuff in there um<br>there are cars you do you don't need<br>cars anywhere but um well sorry you<br>didn't need cars here but the market did<br>demand it I totally get that although<br>it's amazing it did become a sales thing<br>like you go down the basement and it's<br>basically empty and there's just like<br>electric bikes and storage and<br>surfboards um in the car Parks which is<br>epic um um and the funny thing is that<br>so many people that live in the area<br>think it's just one rich dude's<br>house it blows my mind and and Council<br>like you talked to some planners as well<br>and and they I've said you know we put<br>14 homes there and they're like what um<br>where there were two homes 8.2 stars is<br>a higher um Nows rating than we had for<br>the village which just took out every<br>sustainability or whatever um and in<br>this area where they're doing lots of<br>luxury concrete boxes and super high-end<br>Stone and all that we're the only this<br>this is the only development that has<br>sold out 100% in the last five or maybe<br>more years there's so much Surplus<br>stock um so really proud of that and the<br>good thing about this is it government<br>and people like that are looking at it<br>going holy we don't we don't didn't<br>know what to do with all of these you<br>know single story quarter acre block<br>sites maybe this is the way we can do it<br>like it doesn't have to be either or it<br>can be both<br>and borrowing materials from the<br>area um I won't talk about it too much<br>no I won't talk about it at<br>all<br>um the other cool thing and again you<br>know essentially in function it's a<br>we're talking about a traditional<br>developer uh but really interesting the<br>the learnings that came from them being<br>involved in the the first ning Gale<br>things two penthouses sold for Gig buck<br>and then these like look at these plans<br>they're great homes like the bedrooms<br>are not directly off the Living Spaces<br>you've got opening both ends so you<br>could get through breezes um like<br>they're excellent Apartments 1.2 million<br>bucks in Brighton 1.2 million bucks is a<br>lot of money in Brighton it's all like<br>it's so cheap and that's because we had<br>a developer that and it worked as a<br>sales strategy as well get in and get<br>some pre-sales but leveraging some of<br>the pre like the the penthouse to allow<br>some other people to get in so basically<br>it means that people that couldn't<br>afford to stay in your mom and dad could<br>now stay in your mom and dad and their<br>support<br>networks very proud of that because<br>unlike the other stuff where we<br>basically just pulled out the profit<br>that we would have taken so we created<br>sort of this fiction and then everybody<br>else you know sells up and you know<br>makes their money this is basically a<br>15% you know profit return to a<br>developer but it's still doing all these<br>good things why okay you can we can all<br>have an argument about capitalism and<br>I'm there with you but the reality is<br>that's the system Marine if we want to<br>deliver housing now it needs to go<br>through a market that's delivering<br>return to the people that are providing<br>the<br>capital um another so hopefully that's<br>related to New Zealand and I think in<br>many parts this would be too like how do<br>you build apartments in Regional areas<br>I'm sure that so many of you have come<br>up against this like U someone like<br>Bendigo that is urbanizing um<br>quickly uh this site that we we bought<br>again with one of the early<br>collaborators in 0 Gale that got the<br>hell out of there as well they funded it<br>we've designed it in this incredible<br>Precinct um great homes 17 homes of<br>Heritage home as well that we've got<br>really great um sustainability outcomes<br>and we've had a priced to build $550,000<br>per box to build that's the construction<br>price so you got to add on top all your<br>other prices all your other costs your<br>archtics fee and everything else so it<br>goes up from there but that's our quote<br>that's what's interesting about per box<br>as a as a construction rate you can<br>drive out of town 8 minutes and there's<br>a three-bedroom home we're all<br>Architects sitting here and we all go<br>well that's well I'll tell you why<br>that's not a good enough home but the<br>reality is it's a big home on a big<br>block with space for the kids to run<br>around and there's three bedrooms look<br>at the price you know 530 to 575 in<br>Regional areas how do you build<br>Apartments you've got the same you got<br>all the same code you got all the same<br>fire onus fire regulations on it how do<br>you build and the answer is you can't<br>like if people are willing to drive out<br>of town they're going to do it and these<br>we can't even hit these prices it's<br>changed since I I last gave this talk um<br>you know that's where the price we were<br>trying to hit um epic homes but but<br>really I can just go down the road and<br>get something more that I'm sure is<br>similar here as it would be in Australia<br>but we ended up with a bunch of people<br>that were real purchasers most of them<br>were downsizers selling up their<br>property so you know most of them were<br>economically and um were the same age uh<br>and that's all great and all fine and we<br>were you know and then we were<br>approached by a local housing provider<br>that just said can we buy the whole lot<br>off you and we got to pull out some of<br>the quality because we need to hit a<br>price point but can we actually buy the<br>development because um it's probably I<br>don't know if it's still like this you<br>had a change of government but you know<br>basically the funding going<br>into uh housing means that for some of<br>these community housing providers to<br>provide social and affordable housing<br>it's easier for them to just buy whole<br>developments all right so so we are<br>talking a lot so we've got a practice of<br>10 people deliberately small Nimble you<br>know Special Forces Unit I always say<br>like just these incredible people my<br>staff I'm always saying to them you know<br>you could run your own practice and<br>they're like yeah but we see the hell<br>you go through so we're not going to do<br>it um but great people and and but<br>what's brilliant though is that we're<br>like we're talking to all levels of<br>government they want to they want to<br>know like how as you as like w wi<br>designer but you've also gone through<br>the brutal economics of providing<br>housing how do we do it and so we've got<br>great projects like this where<br>government is unlocking land where<br>typically they would have got into a PPP<br>or they would have gone to a developer<br>and just said here you go and develop it<br>just does docklands um uh and actually<br>going how how do we how do we do this um<br>I'll skip through this really quickly<br>this is a presentation I gave to one uh<br>uh sort of M middle ring suburb uh um<br>Council they said how how would we do it<br>we own all this land and instead of<br>going out to traditional developers how<br>could we do it and I was just saying<br>this is how we did it create a<br>development entity get a great architect<br>great development manager build housing<br>that's overly simplified by so much but<br>like like just be the client was the<br>message we were saying like just engage<br>great architect great development<br>manager that's what we did we we created<br>a development entity we we hired the<br>town oh um sorry um and uh Armitage<br>Jones Armitage Jones brilliant uh<br>emerging sort of development managers um<br>uh you know it's beside the point but I<br>love the fact that their the business<br>owners their team were all women at the<br>time as well um and we got in we did<br>that fonk was the development manager<br>for each of the six sites at the Village<br>um and we were saying that for<br>government at all levels to develop<br>their own land they need to rethink this<br>word risk like Risk is a word that<br>developers use to scare away people go I<br>I'll take all the risk but they usually<br>in two ways for that tactically but risk<br>also for them needs opportunity like it<br>is real risk too like a developer can<br>take a massive loss but also there is<br>potential massive uplift and we were<br>just saying that's fine they're business<br>people that's their job like they're<br>producing a product and they turn that<br>opportunity or that risking to profit<br>and if you do it yourselves you can then<br>like we were doing where we pulled the<br>the profit out as much as we could you<br>can go and invest in other things we we<br>just tried we just drove the the sales<br>costs down to under Market that was what<br>we did but as a council you can then go<br>and put in a Childcare Center or more<br>medical facilities or sporting<br>facilities you can actually have those<br>surplus funds that would become profit<br>and do something else with it or just<br>simply drive down the cost um and so the<br>barriers what are the barriers for<br>anybody wearing the developer hat to<br>producing housing okay or the barriers<br>to this like what are the barri like why<br>isn't every single thing prioritizing<br>affordability sustainability and the<br>rest community and the reason is the big<br>risky items access to land super hard<br>people are land banking even though<br>costs have gone crazy everywhere<br>nobody's dropping the price of their<br>land the council owns that land that's<br>like tick gold star that's that already<br>Dr risks the process planning approval<br>this long war that happens that costs<br>like Terrace hous cost $120,000 that<br>just got lumped onto the price of<br>housing just fighting this war with<br>Council and the local neighbors you can<br>drisk that because you're the Goddamn<br>Council like just make a decision um and<br>pull out all of that money access to<br>Capital well that's question mark But if<br>you're got unencumbered land you can you<br>can leverage off that land to fund your<br>own development and then you avoid the<br>early invest like our early investors<br>these lovely clients of mine and that<br>they got back 12% return on their money<br>um thank God they trusted us but the<br>reality is they got a pretty yummy<br>return if they leverage their own land<br>to develop they pull out that straight<br>away so they goals in terms of um I<br>never thought I would talk about this<br>stuff when I started my practice okay<br>debt to equity splits it was a moment I<br>said that in a meeting one day and I was<br>like holy who have I become but the<br>reality is what do what do designers and<br>Architects do we we get constraints and<br>we try to work magic with them and so<br>often those constraints are competing<br>with each other there's no easy way to<br>do anything and the finances are a<br>constraint gravity is a constraint and<br>if you roll up your sleeves and get<br>involved in the spreadsheets you can<br>actually do more creative uh and and<br>critical thinking it is it becomes a<br>design task in itself sorry digressing<br>and then sales you can drisk sales by<br>you know if you've got a brand like ours<br>straight away it does cuz people will be<br>like I want one um but building<br>communities and councils are pretty<br>should be good at that um or don't sell<br>it just own it as an asset and build to<br>rent so this Council we're saying that's<br>that's all the barriers to development<br>um and it's it's amazing that you guys<br>have ticks across the board because most<br>traditional developers and what we did<br>as well with ours we didn't have any of<br>that we like just just sort of wishing<br>wishing a prayer is what we started with<br>we didn't have any of that to start with<br>so if you don't have any of that<br>sustainability and community and all the<br>rest that' be nice if we can tack that<br>on at the end but we've got to think<br>about survivability to start with um so<br>I was just saying to this Council you<br>have a winning hand I know it's scary<br>but God you're so far ahead just please<br>play it and now as we entrench further<br>in the in the uh housing crisis it's not<br>please play it it's like you're obliged<br>to play it you own these assets you own<br>this land you must put housing on<br>it um how to do it enable an ethical<br>delivery team so that goes back to what<br>I was saying before good architect good<br>development manager create a development<br>entity that has really great governance<br>that has all the things that a council<br>should be delivering in terms of their<br>housing and you make it then at arms<br>length to the so you drisk the the<br>council you already have that ahead of<br>you and just start building homes just<br>start be the client this is the problem<br>I think a lot of governments get really<br>freaked out because they don't have<br>embedded expertise just hire that<br>expertise you know be the client that's<br>what used to happen in the ' 50s and 60s<br>you know um and then hopefully there's<br>Surplus money where you can have you<br>know you you could have child care<br>health or anything like that or you<br>could start a housing fund so if there<br>if you accidentally went and made 6% or<br>10% um because you had your contingency<br>there and you got most of it back put it<br>into a housing fund to fund the next<br>development again you're not borrowing<br>money so you're not feeding back debt to<br>Banks or investors it becomes a<br>cascading wind where you can build house<br>after house after house none of this is<br>new they used to do it<br>postwar was called social<br>housing um and so we're doing that now<br>we We're working directly with we<br>essentially with the uh we're just<br>engaged as Architects that know how to<br>do this stuff so um there's a bit more<br>confidence this this one's amazing<br>because they came to us with 57 pretty<br>typical three-story walk up studf frame<br>homes with just your car up to the front<br>of each one of them um and we said you<br>could do that or you could put a<br>shitload more homes 200 and something<br>homes I think we've got on there that<br>will fund a basement where you can put<br>all the cars underneath and then get<br>more green space around here and<br>introduce two parks into it um and then<br>all of this will be given to a community<br>housing provider so there's no<br>speculation there's no for-profit<br>element to it at all um this is going to<br>happen it's so exciting the other thing<br>we're doing too like in Northern New<br>South Wales uh there's a council there<br>that's just flying us up to run<br>charettes with the local community<br>they've got some Surplus land and<br>they're actually we we just go up and we<br>meet with the community and uh many<br>different stakeholders and actually<br>draw outcomes there on the spot instead<br>of talking about it like you know and so<br>one guy there dale is a lawyer uh<br>retired lawyer and he's like he's always<br>sitting like that saying this is what<br>should happen and I like I eventually<br>got him it's take the pen and draw<br>something um so we actually all dip in<br>and we draw outcomes and the great thing<br>about having somebody like Sophie there<br>is she can pretty much run the metrics<br>on those straight away so it's like<br>everything should be a freestanding<br>house right well every house is now four<br>million no no no it doesn't but if you<br>actually go and put three stories on<br>there and do you know hundreds of houses<br>the cost drops to this so it means you<br>got informed decision- making at that<br>meeting so you trim down all the<br>amazing<br>um look and then we're doing other cool<br> I want to show you this one okay<br>this is the last one everybody wake up<br>we're almost there I saw the Nappers you<br>um that was you at I saw<br>you um this one in Townsville so we<br>we're doing projects all over the place<br>and we potentially got one in La that<br>could be epic um this one's in<br>Townsville uh and it's uh it's fun like<br>this this this this doctor who is just<br>like what I do every day drives me crazy<br>I want an off the hook house and he's<br>bought this incredible site and it's<br>like my views you have to protect the<br>views and I'm like bro I've got<br>you and so the the rule here is do not<br>there's no columns shut up like there'll<br>be columns okay<br>um everything has to be in the<br>floor nothing pokes out of it's so much<br>fun and so I've I've he he's like rang<br>me on the stage I'm in Melbourne he's<br>like how's it going should we have an<br>online meeting I was like I'm I'm going<br>to come to Townsville I want to talk to<br>you about this because I just didn't<br>want him to say you're an idiot you're<br>fired uh on on Zoom so I flew up there<br>and he's like let's do it I was like<br>holy um so we're going to do this<br>there will be<br>columns um so much fun so we're still<br>doing this stuff um we're still doing<br>expensive houses for rich people and<br>it's great fun but we're also trying to<br>house as many people as possible like at<br>the end of the day what we're trying to<br>do is just build homes and build<br>resilient homes build sustainable homes<br>um and there's arguments that can be<br>made but the reality is you you you die<br>one day so we're trying to also have fun<br>as well as smash our heads against you<br>know the difficulties of<br>density creating density um thank you so<br>much for putting up with me I appreciate<br>it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
