Human well-being depends on healthy ecosystems. Understanding the biotic and abiotic processes within an ecosystem and how they respond to environmental change is necessary to inform potential interventions to restore and sustain ecosystems. In this lecture, I will (1) describe my attempt to further our understanding of essential ecosystem functions, such as the storage and flux of carbon, water, and nutrients across diverse terrestrial ecosystems, (2) present case studies showing the effect of natural and human disturbances on ecosystem functions, (3) discuss the opportunities and limitations of ecosystem-based strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions.<br><br>ABOUT THE SPEAKER<br>Luitgard grew up on a small farm in the Black Forest. She completed a PhD at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, Germany. After a postdoc in the US and a fixed-term lecturer position in Germany, she moved to New Zealand in 2010 to take a position at the University of Auckland. Her research is at the interface of ecosystem ecology, biogeochemistry, and biodiversity. Her current research focuses on carbon and water fluxes in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and how environmental change alters the functions of ecosystems. She works across diverse terrestrial ecosystems (forests, grasslands, tropics, temperate).</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated

I'm professor of<br>geography to um introduce uh lutgard in<br>complimentary manner<br>to uh the way in which uh George<br>introduced<br>her I'd first like to just say two<br>things one of a very practical nature<br>which is there are<br>exits on each Direction I feel like I'm<br>a flight<br>attendant and if there is any reason to<br>suddenly need those exits we will be<br>guided by our uh trustee event<br>coordinators in the front row there uh<br>secondly I would just like to convey the<br>greetings of uh the dean of science uh<br>professor John hosking who can't be here<br>this evening and he has uh vested me<br>with the honor of um introducing my<br>colleague uh<br>lutgard now the word Professor has the<br>word profess embedded within it and that<br>is really part of the responsibility of<br>being promoted to Professor that we are<br>given the opportunity to<br>uh speak to the wisdom of our<br>disciplinary background and uh this is<br>what we're going to hear something of<br>tonight and an augural lecture is the<br>symbolic uh first public lecture uh from<br>someone promoted to the status of<br>professor at the University it's a<br>tradition that goes back many centuries<br>and the uh uh opportunity of a of a an<br>the uh speaker can connect to their<br>backstory can connect with a general<br>audience and we look forward this<br>evening to hearing a little of uh lot<br>guard's a very diverse background so<br>just to give you a little taste of her<br>biography and you know it's one of those<br>things that even when you're ahead of<br>school and you regularly interact with<br>colleagues you don't quite sometimes<br>appreciate on a day-to-day basis the<br>absolute diversity of their experience<br>it was only when I said to lutgard today<br>could I please have a little thumbnail<br>sketch of your background I'm reading<br>this wow makes me feel very parochial<br>actually uh although she did whisper to<br>me that she feels a little embarrassed<br>about her carbon footprint but<br>nonetheless her bachelor's degree was uh<br>in environmental engineering from uh the<br>University of applied sciences in bingan<br>Germany and uh for that she studied the<br>impact of logging on soil science soil<br>chemical and physical characteristics in<br>the Peace River in Canada Peace River is<br>rather North isn't it and then for her<br>uh MSC which was in resources<br>engineering she studied um sediment<br>nutrient flow in a mangrove ecosystem in<br>Brazil then for her PhD from Ghan<br>Germany she studied the uh uh<br>Subterranean carbon dynamics of a<br>tropical forest in Costa Rica and then<br>going on to undertaking a post postto<br>that involved research in Panama and<br>then she came to us in 2010 and so for<br>the last 14 years she's been a very<br>valuable colleague who has served as um<br>uh head of the uh uh environmental<br>science discipline in our school among<br>uh numerous other uh service capacities<br>and along the way uh gathered together a<br>very productive uh group of postgraduate<br>students and uh uh is a uh clearly a<br>very valued member of this University DP<br>promoted to a full Professor so that's<br>enough from me now I'm looking forward<br>to hearing from you and we're going to<br>ignore these clocks that seem to be<br>unchanged from the last season and<br>they're both actually showing different<br>times this is going to be a Timeless<br>Zone that is only uh going to be um in<br>accordance with uh perhaps uh my cell<br>phone and I might give you a wink if<br>it's about time we had some questions<br>but I'm sure that you're going to be<br>calibrated to the next 45 minutes to<br>leave some time for questions and uh<br>look forward to it very much thank you<br>thank<br>you so thank you Robin and thank you<br>very much uh George for the introduction<br>so many more teral classes for me to be<br>able to um understand what you have been<br>saying thank you for joining me uh this<br>evening uh it turned out to be a quite<br>windy night um so thank you for making<br>it um and to take you on a journey<br>because there might be another surprise<br>because I had a career before I did my<br>first degree so I'll shed some light on<br>this but also take you on a journey<br>introducing uh you to some of the<br>ecosystems I had um uh the fortune and<br>and the pleasure to work in but also to<br>learn and observe and admire um the<br>other processes and the ecos systems uh<br>and what they deliver and provide us<br>with and contributing to our well-being<br>right so let's get<br>started so I grew up on a small farm and<br>this was really end of the road so you<br>would uh what is the saying where only<br>the fox and the rabbit meet and stay for<br>the night farms in that area have names<br>and this is the name of my grandmother's<br>family so Hala and you will be pleased<br>to know so it's still a family farm my<br>brother inherited and is now uh<br>operating<br>it<br>now this must have been a Sunday me all<br>dressed up uh wandering in between the<br>Orchards<br>because Orchards were also part of the<br>farm because there is a farm- owned<br>Distillery because the kwasa has to come<br>and has to be produced somewhere so yeah<br>growing up I definitely got skilled in<br>also making a black forest cake but yeah<br>dairy farm um a small one especially<br>compared to New Zealand standards so<br>here we were talking about 20<br>cows um but also what was very very<br>important um the forest which uh is is<br>part of those Farms because yeah it is<br>um the place where you go when you need<br>a new farm machinery anyway you can<br>imagine you're definitely exposed to<br>Nature because youve been helping on the<br>farm and you get to know quite a bit<br>about weather forecasts and the ups and<br>downs and the good and the bad years so<br>probably a shaping of what I ended up<br>doing for most of my career now a bit of<br>um career journey and this is not to<br>test your um German language skills it's<br>just for me<br>reminders um because the idea my parents<br>had for my career was banking<br>Administration even at that stage no<br>that's not for me so I went to college<br>and trained as a biological technical<br>assistant which provided me with some<br>some really really important skills and<br>many of my students they still know the<br>Legacy because lab work is part of all<br>the work we're doing in uh my research<br>group now how many of you know the time<br>when<br>valan was a topic oh my dear I'm the<br>only one oh thank you thank you<br>Christian thank you thank you thank you<br>V Forest<br>diag I'm I this is this was a topic and<br>in the midst of it I was working for a<br>forest Research Institute as a<br>technician um measuring a lot of tree<br>cores and uh diss to identify the growth<br>patterns and try to find out what's<br>driving the decline in uh tree growth so<br>it was acid rain air pollution<br>definitely one of the drivers but<br>highlight already the complexity climate<br>blade role silver culture management all<br>these things came to the mix and um<br>there is still you know some unknowns<br>luckily the forest did not uh die at<br>that time they actually grew quite well<br>afterwards and suffer now from bar<br>Beetle dieback and other climate related<br>um<br>issues I<br>realized I need a bit of upscaling so I<br>started with a correspondence course in<br>ecology I was also working uh for an<br>Environmental Protection office so going<br>from the research to more the policy<br>side and and planning side um as um as a<br>in a local Council in um times where<br>know environmental issues just become a<br>bit of uh to the Forefront and U you<br>advising Mayors deive deriving or<br>developing policies and here it's just<br>an illustration uh also advising and<br>providing information for elopment<br>gardeners to minimize their pesticide<br>use uh because that was one of the<br>policies of um the local<br>Council<br>anyway topics which um are really really<br>complex and um I'm doing work uh which<br>was usually<br>done people having a graduate degree and<br>I was paid on a technician celery I<br>thought now things have to change so<br>I'll have to get a better Foundation<br>I'll um get my first degree and that's<br>um my first degree environmental<br>engineering it was actually an<br>engineering science degree an amazing<br>degree um I'm definitely um my stronger<br>skills towards the science side so don't<br>rely on my Structural Engineering skills<br>and I was especially drawn to soil<br>science because of the passion Professor<br>B had head for the subject so when the<br>opportunity not opportunity I mean we<br>had to find a topic for our research<br>thesis um I opted uh to do it in Wood<br>Buffalo National Park I have been there<br>uh on an internship was exposed to some<br>of the challenges uh this is a national<br>park Mega clearcuts I just could not<br>believe it and then there were surprised<br>that there was issues with the<br>Regeneration of um white spruce so I was<br>looking into whether it had to do with<br>limitations and soil chemistry and soil<br>physical properties amazing soil<br>profiles uh it's just extraordinary what<br>you can see what the history lays down<br>was a mix of flooding and then the<br>regrowth of forests<br>um<br>not there was a danger element as well<br>because this is the country of black<br>bears and uh Wood Buffalo um but also<br>what I want to highlight here the cabin<br>also served as the lab because I had to<br>preprocess the samples to be shipped to<br>Germany and then analyzed as part of my<br>Theses um I ended up getting a position<br>at State Institute for statistics it did<br>not last that long and went um on to do<br>my master thesis um and yet did my<br>research in mangr forest in Brazil as<br>you see later on mangroves are still<br>part of uh for my<br>research okay now the remaining part of<br>the talk they're divided into three<br>parts so first uh some introduction into<br>ecosystem functions uh using soil carbon<br>Dynamics as an example but also uh<br>talking about the link between<br>biodiversity and uh water cycling and<br>this uh just to get us all onto the same<br>page um so I'm particularly focusing on<br>those biological physical processes you<br>influencing the transformation of carbon<br>nutrients um in ecosystem so the linkage<br>between the biotic part and the abiotic<br>part as you can see there is a bit of<br>complexity involved because there are so<br>many factors influencing those processes<br>and um I'm yeah particularly focusing on<br>those major uh functions uh like<br>production productivity grows of of<br>organisms but also then the breakdown uh<br>led to uh water and nutrient<br>cycling so this um was the place where I<br>did my PhD I spent with substantial<br>amount uh at lasa Biological Station so<br>1,500 hectar reserve and the Foothills<br>uh Caribbean lowlands in Costa Rica no<br>amazing amazing<br>forests um and what brought me to the<br>topic uh this is my um PhD advisor so<br>thank you ETO for taking on uh a mature<br>PhD student giving uh me the opportunity<br>to uh do my PhD on this subject so what<br>has been found at that stage um was that<br>there is a substantial amount of carbon<br>stored below 30 cm it was like that<br>everyone knows that now at that time and<br>stage and even nowadays there's still<br>sort of thinking yeah most of the things<br>happen in in the closer to surface soil<br>but we should not underes they made was<br>store deeper down and even more striking<br>is the activity which happens the or um<br>the organism the microorganisms you know<br>contributing to breakdown and<br>transfer so when I did my PhD I was<br>lucky enough not to have to dig these<br>profiles because they are three to four<br>meter deep um but that did not mean um<br>taking additional soil samples so<br>running around with<br>soil orgers on the back and eyes on the<br>ground because of the poisonous snakes<br>to obtain the precious information so<br>just here an illustration here the<br>reserve we're talking about two<br>different soil types which um yeah<br>influenced uh the findings so here what<br>one of those um you know major processes<br>with soil respiration the second largest<br>carbon flux after photosynthesis<br>so a flux which is very very important<br>when we're looking into carbon budgets<br>you know potential implications of land<br>use and so on so what we have been<br>finding um spatial differences between<br>the soil which is derived from volcanic<br>uh soil uh having a higher trans<br>transpiration respiration than the ones<br>on the aluvial soil so driven by um the<br>amount of carbon stored in the soil<br>phosphorus rot activity because what we<br>measure as soil C2 e flux is the sum of<br>heterotrophic respiration plus root<br>respiration now just on a site<br>development of tools and techniques is<br>definitely advancing we call this Rover<br>I have no idea why it was called Rover<br>because there was nothing roving with it<br>we had to carry it um but nowadays these<br>type of equipment is a bit<br>smaller now George told me not to talk<br>about anything climate related sorry um<br>these<br>processes are influenced by temperature<br>and moisture and in this case it's not<br>temperature driving the amount of soil<br>soil CO2 respired back into the<br>atmosphere uh it is moisture here with<br>an Optimum corve so um moisture<br>enhancing the activity of microorganisms<br>the diffusion uh of gases but then once<br>you reach a certain point it all goes<br>downhill because the pores are blocked<br>with water less oxygen less activity by<br>microorganisms but also less possibility<br>for the gas to diffuse out what's of<br>even more concern is this finding uh so<br>not only looking into what's emitted<br>back into the atmosphere but also where<br>is the carbon coming from acknowledging<br>that we have this activity in deeper<br>layers and then find ing this um<br>extremely positive correlation between<br>temperature and soil CO2 production so<br>concerned because if we have increasing<br>temperatures which penetrates down<br>through the soil profile uh we may see<br>you know positive feedback and increase<br>in biogenic emissions into the<br>atmosphere now carbon is only one part<br>of the cycle has dominated a lot of my<br>career but I like water as much and um<br>also because carbon and the water cycle<br>are so closely linked we can't do them<br>one without the other here talking about<br>the greenw cycle so the water which is<br>taken up by plants um and moving through<br>the plants transpired in contributing<br>then to uh the rainfall yeah you were<br>wondering how can you measure the amount<br>of water used by plants so we're using<br>the so-called um thermal dissipation<br>method or granier method where you stuck<br>two thermocouples into the water<br>conducting SE wood um and based on temp<br>one probe is heated based on temperature<br>differences complex equations you can<br>estimate the amount of water uh<br>transpired now what's the context now<br>here I'll take you on a trip to Panama I<br>don't think many of you know this<br>children book uh very popular one in<br>Germany it expose you to biodiversity by<br>first of all introducing Kine POA who<br>set up this first Tre diversity<br>experiment in the tropics um but also um<br>here Elise pendel at that time at the<br>University of Wyoming and now what<br>better to do doing a post in Wyoming but<br>working in Panama So to avoid the<br>winters but uh yes so um she introduced<br>me you know to uh to uh cin and um be<br>able to to work on the plantation so the<br>setup because the question is are more<br>diverse plantations more productive<br>basically grow do the trees grow better<br>because that's that's important for<br>various reasons um and uh one of them is<br>definitely also carbon sequestration so<br>the plantation was set up in<br>monocultures uh two and three species<br>mixtures and five species mixtures as<br>you can see here you know each species<br>has a certain characteristic<br>right some lose their leaves this is<br>during the twi season some develop new<br>leaves some are tall and skinny and some<br>are a bit broader so very different in<br>their physical<br>characteristics now what uh we found um<br>so this um as um as Robin said before I<br>moved to New Zealand I was on a fixed<br>term position at the University of<br>gutting and where I also did my PhD in<br>the department of tropical cic culture<br>and tropical ecology in De culture the<br>head of Department you had a lot of<br>expertise in you know water flux and SE<br>flux so great also learning experience<br>and Nobert kunard here busy installing<br>Seux sensors into trees what did we find<br>here on the x-axis you have the diameter<br>on the y- AIS you have the water<br>use and without going into detail what<br>we can observe so the mixtur so the<br>trees growing in mixtures they had a<br>higher water use compared to the ones<br>growing in<br>monoculture so yes this is basically<br>what you want if you're looking into<br>carbon but do you want to have excessive<br>water use because interestingly these<br>trees did not turn it into carbon or<br>that's that's a bit of a concern<br>especially if you're working in in a<br>system where water is limiting so what<br>could have led to this so some<br>fundamental um yeah mechanisms to<br>explain some of the biodiversity effect<br>effect so complimentarity effect so<br>lower competition because they all have<br>their um specific characteristics they<br>have need complimentarity but overall on<br>on an area they have a more efficient<br>utilization of<br>resources now this could be uh as I was<br>uh indicating um by a change in canopy<br>uh because you can imagine here the<br>roughness is higher potentially wind<br>wind speed is higher which influences<br>the amount of water transpired so this<br>is above ground now but you can also<br>observe a differences in the rooting<br>pattern so where um depending on the<br>species some may have really shallow<br>root distribution so only be able to tap<br>and use water from upper layers While<br>others may go deeper down so growing<br>next to each other they may not compete<br>for the same pool of water now how do we<br>find this out stable isotopes<br>101 um so a<br>natural occurrence so it has nothing to<br>do with um radioisotopes which I talk<br>about a little bit later but so the<br>atoms of an element having the same<br>number of uh protons and neut electrons<br>but different numbers of uh neutrons so<br>as you can see the size of the cats<br>differs here the one representing oxygen<br>18 eight neutrons<br>slight slightly larger one uh oxygen 18<br>containing um 10<br>neutrons difference in size has<br>implications on the evaporation of water<br>for example so this is um the tool I've<br>been using and and setting up at um the<br>University of gang and here showing with<br>these differences in their behavior uh<br>for example uh when we're talking about<br>evapor ation you have a gradient of<br>isotopic signatures and this you can use<br>to identify where for example this one<br>or takes up its water compared to this<br>one because we assume that the mix which<br>we find in the sep flow in the exym is<br>the summon and of the sources where<br>those trees tap into so quite a bit of<br>field and lab work required to get the<br>water out of this material and then um<br>analyze it in a mass spectrometer and<br>with some<br>modeling you can quantify where is the<br>water coming from again showing these<br>five different<br>species uh in their different size and<br>shape during the tri season uh where we<br>can see that the one which shed its<br>leaves at the onset of the tri season<br>relies on water from the top layer so<br>maybe not a surprise they lose their<br>leaves because this is the area where<br>water is most Brown to differences in<br>soil water availability because that's<br>where you know evaporation uh<br>happens now we have another species tyaa<br>during Dr season investing a lot of<br>energy to activate its roots in deeper<br>layers where we have you more Still<br>Water available so they would not<br>compete for water because they're using<br>a very different compartments of the<br>soil there are some others they go<br>across the profile so anyway these<br>complimentary water use definitely one<br>of their possibilities to contribute to<br>the overall you know enhanced uh water<br>transpiration which we found at this<br>Plantation so think hopefully a nice<br>case study know again showing the<br>linkages understanding the mechanisms<br>and you know applying a variety of tools<br>to assess uh where uh the wood has been<br>taken up okay right want to move on to<br>the second part uh talking about<br>ecosystem responses to<br>disturbance and here I'll um talk about<br>and focus on the ecological impacts of<br>tree diseases um which um I spent you<br>know quite a number of years um working<br>in that area so Forest iack horse by<br>pathogens definitely not something new<br>so uh you know you may have heard about<br>Dutch lmdc Chestnut BL and and diseases<br>which um have gone through forest and<br>eradicated species so what um I'm<br>focusing on is some Rust species so for<br>example mytle rust a fairly recent<br>arrival to New Zealand and<br>also uh the myates phof where we have<br>Kye dabeck as an<br>example so thanks to Nick via um at the<br>time when he introduced me to the<br>subject he was still at at Oakland<br>Council<br>um but uh you know introducing me uh to<br>the topic and thanks to him also for his<br>interest in not looking only into the<br>pathogen and what it does to the tree<br>but also the wider perspective so what<br>are the implications on the ecosystem<br>and here we're talking about CI forests<br>uh which it's uh really specific<br>characteristics regarding their uh<br>chemistry regarding you know the size<br>and the dominance in ecosystems<br>went um you through Oakland Council uh<br>we received a scholarship where Donna<br>fer West who is the master student did<br>sort of a first study looking into uh<br>what is the composition of the leaflet<br>are falling down of the trees is there<br>more L of falling down because phyo<br>destroys the roots um with subsequent<br>consequences in in nutrition and water<br>update loss of leaves and um and so on<br>the dieback of the canopy and Tre deps<br>so what he found was in a really really<br>small um scale study that um they<br>observed that less reproductive material<br>of cowry is found in in those little TRS<br>which is of concern because that means<br>you know the next generation is not<br>happening because if you have know less<br>less seed uh sources but what we also<br>were looking into what are the<br>implications on the water passing<br>through the canopy the so-called<br>throughfall which I think is often<br>ignored but it's definitely also an<br>important pathway of you know<br>Distributing nutrients transporting it<br>from one location to<br>another and um thanks to be mik a<br>collaborator at the University of viena<br>in Germany uh who spent her sabatical in<br>2015 uh in<br>Oakland um we set up an experiment<br>measuring all the different water fluxes<br>so here what you can see here there's so<br>so-called sfall collector we developed a<br>non disturbing stemflow collector so<br>there is nothing um you know hindering<br>and and damaging uh the bark and then we<br>also collected water underneath the<br>organic layer and thanks to B because um<br>she analyzed all those samples and um<br>finan the analysis what we have been<br>finding is that there is an implication<br>so we see less carbon and nutrients<br>coming into the system or passing<br>through the canopy um in situations<br>where we have a high concentration of<br>the<br>pathogen could have various reasons I<br>mean at that time we had more questions<br>than answers um it could be because we<br>have less leaves so less water being<br>able to hit the leaves and leech<br>nutrients and carbon off it it could<br>have been a change in leaf chemistry uh<br>so a multitude of potential um you<br>reasons uh leading to this um<br>outcome now uh funding in the space<br>especially if you look uh be Beyond<br>operational and uh the actual um<br>implications on the host all there was<br>uh funding made available as part of<br>saving our iconic trees Naraku Tak Tak a<br>program which just came to an end and<br>Marie uh was co-leading one of the um<br>themes as well so I was appointed to<br>co-lead the theme risk assessment and<br>ecosystem impacts together with Simon<br>bner from cion social scientist so our<br>mandate was uh to examine the impact of<br>the diag on The Wider ecosystem and also<br>you identify what's at risk and uh<br>establishing baselines and we really<br>tried to you know use a holistic<br>approach um so thank you and uh George<br>uh also uh indicated as thank you to<br>tavra omaki because the white t re<br>Rangers they're still under rahui for<br>granting uh an exemption to the rahui<br>for us to be able to conduct the<br>research but also thank you to George<br>and Bruce Burns because they had the<br>foresight to set up plots in the<br>whiteaker ranges about you over 10 years<br>ago um with no no little funding I think<br>James was also part of the team<br>measuring setting up those blots which<br>we now have the benefit to go back and<br>revisit in and assess what happened to<br>the the growth of the trees um the the<br>host of of the pathogen the C but also<br>the neighboring species so do we see<br>changes in plant Community composition<br>so just one example because I was sort<br>of surprised given this is a soil and<br>rootborn disease um Janie thank you for<br>being here today um doing her master CES<br>working on um you know the the amount of<br>roots found in the soil but also uh the<br>production uh of roots so what we see<br>and already sort of indicate potential<br>shifts what we see above ground also<br>reflected below ground so first of all<br>you know the root growth of C is<br>definitely a lot less given a fairly<br>short amount of time so that again it<br>represents also the species you know um<br>potentially rather slow growing but what<br>we also see the non-cow roots um they<br>benefit from locations where the<br>pathogen is detected where the trees<br>also show symptoms of dieck because<br>because you know different light regimes<br>um you know less competition for space<br>below ground which they can use and and<br>benefit from it um so again those<br>ecosystem level not only looking into<br>the host but the surrounding the changes<br>the dynamic of systems of how what<br>what's<br>observed then uh a brief uh not should<br>shouldn't say brief but the other<br>pathogen I'm also<br>I've been looking at so I learning a lot<br>about pathogens and a lot about you know<br>um different in new subjects so thank<br>you uh much for inviting me to be part<br>of uh the successful Beyond mytw team uh<br>looking into the impacts of of Myrtle<br>rust so an airborne disease on here in<br>this case um ecosystem functions and<br>thank you haa um for um you know Against<br>All Odds um during Co um taking care of<br>the plants on your balcony um before we<br>were able to move them back into the<br>class house uh so definitely disruptive<br>here the same for for the other program<br>um you quite some challenges for field<br>and lab based um scientists but here and<br>also illustrating that we're working at<br>different scales different tools here in<br>Glass House experiment because we're<br>definitely um yeah working on on an<br>organisms we do not want uh to spread<br>and do this um in uh under ambient under<br>environmental conditions and so this<br>more the most plant physiological work I<br>think I have done um you know looking<br>into tree grows the behavior during the<br>cycle of of the pathogen U because it<br>has different stages which has different<br>implications on um here the<br>photosynthesis which is definitely<br>infected but also some interesting<br>pattern with um with the stomatal<br>conductance again looking into water and<br>um carbon and then you know internal<br>processes right now part<br>three um how can we apply and<br>use some of those learnings um from you<br>know ecosystem processes uh in the<br>context of nature-based solutions to<br>help address societal<br>challenges um so two examples are<br>looking into urban vegetation and then<br>also talking about uh blue carbon and<br>especially in the context of um CO2<br>emissions in in carbon um um you know<br>sequestration so what are nature-based<br>solutions fairly new term for what<br>others call ranges from Green<br>infrastructure um ecosystem based<br>adaptation so quite a wide range of<br>terms you know it's all Rel ated and<br>based on know processes on natural<br>processes so it can be the protection<br>restoration um enhancement of forest<br>Landscapes so we're doing definitely a<br>lot in the restoration space it could be<br>the same or similar activities along the<br>coast um here we're looking into urban<br>systems uh but these uh nature um based<br>Solutions they're not only in the<br>context of mitigation of of CO2<br>emissions it's also to improve water<br>quality uh to enhance biodiversity so so<br>a wide range of um yeah hope or expected<br>outcomes of these activities so just to<br>uh shed some light um as yeah being in<br>Oakland and how many have commented that<br>we were almost again a crit loock<br>situation tonight and when I was walking<br>uh to una this afternoon I thought now<br>it's not Oakland going to solve this<br>issue um because cities you know the the<br>predominant um emissions are transport<br>um you besides Energy use and so on and<br>probably many of you have also estimate<br>your personal footprint but there's also<br>hope because if we<br>can take measures and improve um<br>situations in urban systems we can<br>definitely contribute to um um a<br>minimization of emissions uh<br>globally now Al L wiisard uh my first<br>PhD student here at the University of<br>Oakland Co by chenny Salman um we were<br>interested so what is the potential of<br>uran vegetation uh to mitigate local CO2<br>emissions in um L literature review it I<br>mean for many many many cases is most of<br>the literature most of the Studies have<br>been done in the Northern Hemisphere and<br>what I one thing I definitely learned<br>throughout my career is don't transfer<br>knowledge which you obtain in place a to<br>place B because that's not never going<br>to work in in New Zealand again we have<br>a particular ecosystems we have<br>particular tree species so yeah we were<br>lacking information on what would the<br>situation be because what has been<br>observed is the higher the vegetation<br>cover<br>uh the less uh CO2 you see uh in in the<br>atmosphere now how can we measure<br>this so uh a different approach a quite<br>complex approach and don't ask me how<br>long it took us to find a site where we<br>were allowed to set up a 10 m tall<br>Mast um because this is what it is<br>required of and the higher the better<br>because you have to be at least twice<br>the height of your average sort of<br>Building height or tree height or<br>whatever you're going to measure because<br>we're using here the so-called ovarian<br>method so super super super high<br>frequency measurements of wind direction<br>and wind speed together uh with the<br>measurements of uh CO2 so finally we're<br>able to find a location together with an<br>air um Quality station at hock bony<br>Downs a fairly new recent um uh<br>residential development so what did we<br>find so what this figure shows so on the<br>xaxis you have the time of the day and<br>on the y axis you have the CO2 e flux so<br>now the CO2 in the atmosphere now how to<br>read this so when you see a negative<br>flux means uptake so there is CO2 taken<br>up uh out of the atmosphere here in in<br>this case into uh plant growths<br>so yes we definitely see uptake means<br>photosynthetic activity all year round<br>thanks to many many many Evergreen<br>species we have in<br>Oakland<br>still we had here in this case about 47%<br>of vegetation cover and the area is<br>still a<br>source also what we did are using in<br>this case radiocarbon which you can use<br>to distinguish between ENT genic<br>emissions so fossil fuel derived uh<br>emissions which are related to transport<br>versus the biogenic emissions again<br>brings us back to soil<br>respiration uh to the respiration of<br>plants and what we found um was that<br>definitely during peak hour yeah you see<br>the signal of fossil fuel coming through<br>but know the tree grow trees grows well<br>but that also means the microbes do well<br>they break down they respire so biogenic<br>emission<br>is also contributing to the CO2 which<br>we're seeing in the atmosphere now which<br>then reminds us what can we do regarding<br>land use management to you know<br>influence this you know how can we um<br>the selection of species with with the<br>uptake know management of of our green<br>spaces are there ways to minimize um you<br>know stimulating the breakdown and the<br>release okayy now being in<br>Oakland um blue<br>carbon oh thank you Caroline for I'm I<br>don't recall when and where we met but<br>we have supervised quite a number of<br>students and we have called through some<br>quite some mud and mangroves uh across<br>the Oakland region over the past decade<br>or<br>so um blue carbon also one so this is<br>the carbon stor in oceans and in coastal<br>vegetation all<br>also promoted um and you sometimes it it<br>feels like you know these are all the<br>solutions these are the Silver Bullets<br>um without really understanding or<br>knowing enough of the system so what um<br>we did first of all I mean we we knew<br>that the area of mangroves definitely<br>changed um across Oakland and also where<br>mangroves occur in New Zealand<br>um but I think it was still the first<br>study to really quantify it so that<br>wasis work a PhD student using a lot of<br>field-based work but also remote sensing<br>to really uh quantify and and um what is<br>it called area photographs to quantify<br>the change and the increase in mangroves<br>what was surprising that because we<br>always thought oh yeah these are all<br>going going seaword no it's so-called<br>now I call it densification because they<br>did a lot of filling um that uh yeah<br>definitely um considerable increase from<br>2,000 hectares in in 1940 when uh we<br>started uh you quantify I mean we used<br>aerial images the first ones sort of<br>available in photographs aerial<br>photograph not not for aerial<br>photographs photographs and uh you know<br>to 10 over 10,000 hectar in in 2014 when<br>when C did the work so a lot of<br>fluctuation but also you know there was<br>a lot of information floating around oh<br>yeah this is because of sedimentation<br>this is because of enhanced input but it<br>was<br>also here was su's work to really pin it<br>down because it was just I mean I was<br>astonished how closely linked it was you<br>have Forest Clearing in the catchment<br>and subsequently you know you have<br>higher sedimentation rates and mangroves<br>know they just like the conditions so<br>they're they're benefiting from modified<br>conditions and um now but what what is<br>there are there the contribution to<br>carbon uh storage so like many cases<br>it's highly variable location and tree<br>Size Matters we only have one species in<br>New Zealand but their shape and form is<br>quite uh diverse so well it's more like<br>dwarf type uh statue but we also have<br>really tall growing mangroves not as<br>tall as the ones I've seen in Brazil and<br>as as I say the system not as species<br>diverse but quite a strong sonation with<br>distance uh you know from from the A3 to<br>inwards it also depends whether they're<br>growing along rivers where you see the<br>tallest ones whether they're estrine<br>mangroves Delta mangroves so quite um<br>quite a quite range of um variability so<br>just you know along some of those aies<br>which we<br>investigated across uh Oakland so quite<br>um some variation above ground but here<br>look at how much is stored below ground<br>so that's the the root biomass um but<br>also what's what's stored in the<br>sediment you know just uh flicking back<br>um you know uh Richard was was really<br>instrumental in developing those<br>equations because you know how do OB how<br>do you obtain the amount of carbon<br>stored in systems so basically you have<br>to harvest a few trees to get a size<br>biomass relationship uh which he did you<br>know for mangrove trees but also<br>especially below grounds and and you can<br>imagine how tedious and a lot of work<br>that is to sort out roots of these you<br>clay soft sediment uh Rich sediments but<br>that's what's required to be able to to<br>do this quantification and then also to<br>be able to upscale uh to larger<br>scale yes so that's um now our<br>contribution we have done that also in<br>terrestrial areas to really identify U<br>you know dises related carbon<br>sequestration rates as I say um you know<br>they're all different with a grow<br>pattern and how they um relate to to<br>environmental conditions but I just um<br>want to um sort of<br>conclude um that you know those<br>nature-based Solutions definitely have<br>have their important Place uh when we're<br>talking about you know um offsetting and<br>minimizing some some of our uh emissions<br>and other ecosystem benefits because<br>hopefully I've made um shed some light<br>that now don't focus on one because it's<br>so closely linked because if you if you<br>maximize something for carbon you have<br>to think about what are the implications<br>on the water or or nutrient cycle but<br>it's also to remain realistic right<br>because um there are you know one tool<br>in our<br>toolbx um but uh but know we have to<br>really explore and understand especially<br>when we're talking about restoration<br>where there is a lot thereof but now how<br>many restoration projects has anyone<br>gone back and see how many trees<br>survived and how well they have<br>grown um the because there is um you<br>know a lot of studies done now<br>calculating how much could we offset how<br>much could we mitigate uh with um with<br>uh you know restoration and so on which<br>which may end up with uh land uh to<br>offset shortages because then we're<br>competing uh with<br>other um demands on land as well and<br>then also what hopefully the examples uh<br>showed now we have to know their<br>behavior under potentially modified uh<br>conditions so may it be climatic<br>conditions but also when we're talking<br>about Coastal systems right now our<br>sedimentation rates largely exceeds the<br>sea level rate but if that changes now<br>we have a complete modification of the<br>space in the um where where the trees<br>can grow so just to summarize hopefully<br>I was able to shed some light and to a<br>number of ecosystems and their related<br>functions uh the complexity and um<br>probably a bit more work cut out for me<br>over the next few years with all uh the<br>topics which are still needs to be<br>interesing and uh to contribute uh to<br>hopefully uh better um environmental<br>conditions in the future so thank you<br>and I'm looking forward to<br>questions Ian there are so many people<br>and um it is very very difficult<br>difficult definitely colleagues and<br>collaborators um the technical team<br>because usually my requests are always a<br>bit last<br>minute um and know the environmental<br>science team for the pragmatic approach<br>to solve our uh issues and move forward<br>with with teaching and whatever uh we<br>we'll have uh to do um you know<br>colleagues and friends and um also a<br>shout out to uh my youngest sister um<br>who helped me with some of of the<br>research work uh but also know remains a<br>really really strong link uh to you know<br>family at home and dealing with whatever<br>you know aging parents and and family<br>situation throws at you so thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
