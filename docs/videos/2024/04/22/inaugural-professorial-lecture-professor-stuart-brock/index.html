all on behalf of the<br>university to this professorial lecture<br>to Mark Professor Stuart Brock joining<br>us as deputy Vice Chancellor<br>academic I'd like to give a warm welcome<br>to students to Stuart's friends and<br>colleagues and students who are with us<br>on in person and online I'd like to give<br>a special welcome to steuart's partner<br>Maro um who's with us in person this<br>evening and to his father John um son<br>Julian and brothers Anthony and Greg who<br>are watching on live stream it's lovely<br>to have you all with<br>us so ipls are a real treat for me<br>anyway if and I hope for the rest of<br>you um they give us an opportunity to<br>learn about our talented academics and<br>to showcase the excellent research that<br>occurs across the university and for<br>some of us to embrace understanding of<br>disciplines that differ from our<br>own in a moment Professor Weber is going<br>to provide a formal introduction to<br>Stuart but first I just wanted to say a<br>few words um first because in Stuart's<br>case he was a professor before he came<br>to atago so while this is his first<br>public lecture this is not technically<br>his inaugural professorial lecture<br>although steuart's just confided in me<br>that he managed to escape his IPL at Vic<br>so it's probably<br>appropriate um I first met Stuart at the<br>University of New Zealand meetings of<br>the dvca from the eight universities<br>when I was the dvca um and Stuart was<br>and is highly thought of in that group<br>he is a reputation being for being a<br>thoughtful collegial person<br>understanding the academic landscape and<br>for getting things done his experience<br>as Vice Pro provest and dvca and a<br>member of the senior leadership team at<br>Victoria have enabled him to come in and<br>hit the road running his wealth of<br>experience and his ability to bring<br>fresh eyes are already Pro proving<br>beneficial to a taro so Stuart we're<br>delighted that you decided to join us<br>here I'm very much looking forward to<br>your lecture and I'd now like to invite<br>Professor Zach Weber head of the<br>philosophy program to provide a formal<br>you thank you Helen uh Koto um associate<br>professor Zack Weber can everybody hear<br>me I'm the head of the philosophy<br>program here at atago uh and it's my<br>absolute pleasure tonight to be here to<br>help W welcome uh Professor Stuart Brock<br>to aago along with recognizing his new<br>role here as the deputy Vice Chancellor<br>academic I'm here to introduce Stuart as<br>a philosopher which is his academic home<br>and background and I'm especially here<br>to say on behalf of the philosophy<br>program at atago that we're simply<br>thrilled uh to welcome him here to be<br>part of our community uh it's great<br>Stuart has a long and distinguished<br>research record uh his interests are in<br>the area of metaphysics philosophy of<br>language philosophy of literature and<br>the philosophy of emotions<br>uh a lot of his work as you'll hear<br>tonight centers around the ideas raised<br>by fiction his first article in fact was<br>titled modal fictionalism what's<br>interesting about that is that it was<br>written when he was still an<br>undergraduate student uh doing a ba at<br>manes and published in the journal mind<br>which is probably the most prestigious<br>Journal you could publish in uh as an<br>undergraduate so no small thing there<br>well done uh since then uh Stuart did<br>his master degree at the Australian<br>National University in canra and did a<br>PhD at Princeton he taught at Western<br>Washington University before coming to<br>the University of Victoria Wellington<br>where he's held various senior roles as<br>Helen just mentioned amongst all that uh<br>impressive leadership work he did he has<br>continued to teach philosophy teaching<br>things like critical thinking<br>epistemology metaphysics and the<br>philosophy of literature and has<br>published a lot of important work on<br>fiction and<br>metaphysics uh so he's published lots of<br>articles and chapters in reference works<br>including in places like philosophical<br>studies philosophical quarterly the<br>Journal of philosophy and noose and the<br>philosophical review uh which for those<br>of you who are in the know realize that<br>I just rattled off basically the top<br>five journals in the area uh so that's<br>pretty good too he also has several<br>books most recently a new collection on<br>moral and religious fictionalism with<br>Oxford University press if you want to<br>have a look at it uh we've got a copy in<br>the reception at philosophy uh you can<br>come over and ask Karen to show it to<br>you uh so it's a pleasure to have him<br>here participating in the life of the<br>university and the life of our program<br>so I'll just say one or two words about<br>uh the thread through his research which<br>is fictionalism which he'll tell you<br>more more about fiction but what is that<br>um philosophers have traditionally<br>really been into<br>Truth uh and so traditionally going all<br>the way back to Plato there's a lot of<br>skepticism about fiction which pretty<br>much by definition is not true<br>uh so how philosophers Wonder could we<br>ever gain knowledge by just imagining<br>things to ourselves especially things<br>that we know aren't so isn't fiction the<br>opposite of Truth so the answer that you<br>could give is that fiction can still be<br>deeply valuable and we can learn<br>profound things from it and even find it<br>useful even if it is fiction uh it's the<br>idea that some things can be good<br>without being true and if philosophy is<br>about helping us make sense of Our Lives<br>maybe sometimes the thing to do is to<br>look at a dry ethical treat cus but<br>sometimes the thing to do is to dip into<br>a good piece of literature and then come<br>back to real life Having learned<br>something from the experience um so as<br>Iris Murdoch once put it man is a<br>creature who makes pictures of himself<br>and then comes to resemble the picture<br>and I like that very much this semester<br>we're very happy that Stuart is teaching<br>religious fictionalism in the philosophy<br>program alongside uh Heather Dyke and me<br>in a new honors course that we've got<br>and I think this bodess very very well<br>um not just because our students I think<br>some of whom are here well they said<br>they would be here oh I'm going to talk<br>to them and okay not just because our<br>students will benefit from his expertise<br>but by doing this teaching for us I<br>think it really shows what kind of<br>leader uh Stuart has come here to be<br>teaching is not a requirement of the<br>dvca role uh but when he arrived here he<br>said to me that he just couldn't imagine<br>leading an overseeing teaching at aago<br>without doing some teaching at aago and<br>that's music to my ears that's what you<br>want leaders to be if only more generals<br>would do that um so that's in a word<br>marvelous uh he's offered to teach about<br>modal metaphysics and the philosophy of<br>language and he has ideas about other<br>classes too like ones where we get<br>undergraduates to try to publish in<br>prestigious journals and now I know<br>where he got the idea uh so thinking<br>about fiction is to ask questions about<br>ourselves and our imaginations as we'll<br>hear tonight we are in very good hands<br>so welcome and congratulations<br>k<br>I want to start this evening uh by<br>tonight for those of you who don't know<br>me and I assume most if not all of you<br>do my name is Stuart Brock I am the DVC<br>academic I am F first and foremost a<br>philosopher it's an absolute honor to be<br>here tonight I'm very grateful to have<br>the privilege to give this lecture to<br>you all tonight but I feel it's somewhat<br>self-indulgent uh so I do um do thank<br>you for sitting through uh this hour or<br>part I want to structure the lecture as<br>follows I want to start by telling you a<br>bit about myself giving you a bit of<br>personal history then I want to tell you<br>a little bit about my research and I've<br>I've uh some of it is very Arcane and<br>esoteric uh I've tried to avoid talking<br>about that and try and focus on on part<br>of my research that I think might<br>interest uh some of<br>you and then I want to finish uh by<br>talking to you a little bit about what<br>my Approach as the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor academic will be at uh at<br>atago University and I'm going to try<br>and Link some of what I<br>in my uh discussion about my research to<br>how I think about what I do uh in my<br>role as<br>dvca um I will warn you from the<br>beginning it's a little bit of a long<br>bow uh I hope to draw here but I hope<br>you'll excuse me<br>tonight um let me start though by<br>thanking uh those of you those family in<br>Australia my son Julian my brother s ant<br>and Greg who are watching uh via the<br>live live<br>stream I'd like to thank my in-laws in<br>Japan shitaka son maduri son and kanako<br>son I'd like to also thank uh my family<br>and friends in New Zealand who couldn't<br>make it here tonight who are watching by<br>live stream especially Emma and<br>Louie I'd also like to thank everybody<br>without exception at

SLT<br>colleagues I'd like to especially thank<br>all of the staff the professional staff<br>who work for me they do an outstanding<br>job<br>I'd like to thank the academic staff who<br>do all of the core work of the<br>University you do an amazing<br>job and I'd like to thank the philosophy<br>program for welcoming me uh and and you<br>really have welcomed me uh inviting me<br>to uh to take part in the life of the<br>dep Department I've been uh to the pub<br>many evenings uh with you all and have<br>appreciated those<br>opportunities I'd like to also thank all<br>of those who e emailed me uh before my<br>before my talk this evening I did invite<br>people to do that um I especially asked<br>invited them to give me advice on um how<br>I should think about the new role as<br>dbca that was that was what I I was<br>really hoping for and I want to reflect<br>some of that advice back to you<br>tonight but what I was blown away by was<br>that a lot of people did that but a lot<br>of people also took the time to write to<br>me about the content of the philosophy<br>I'm going to talk about tonight and the<br>people who did that were often people<br>working outside of the discipline so I<br>really thank you for that early<br>engagement in what I'm going to talk<br>about<br>tonight I do have two special thanks<br>tonight though um before I start the<br>first one is to my partner Maro um I am<br>so grateful to you for everything you've<br>done for me all the support you give me<br>um I couldn't be here without you I<br>couldn't have taken on the role without<br>you<br>um I want to thank you also for making<br>sure you could be here this evening it<br>really means means the world to me so<br>thank you so much sweetheart<br>um the most special thanks I I want to<br>uh give tonight though is to my Father<br>John dad um dad was diagnosed with um<br>with terminal cancer about 2 years<br>ago um he was not given much time to<br>live he was told not to plan for his<br>80th birthday which was just a few<br>months<br>away dad I want to thank you for<br>sticking around a little bit longer uh<br>really appreciate that I also want to<br>thank you for all the support you've<br>given me over the years and when I I<br>reflect on<br>it he you know he gave me uh a lot of<br>love skills knowledge that that really<br>brought me to where I am today or was<br>really important to it but when I<br>reflect back on the kind of<br>support that my father has given<br>me uh I I can say without a shadow of a<br>doubt he has read<br>more of my work than anyone else in the<br>world um so Dad thank you for engaging<br>with that and thank you for being here<br>tonight at least<br>online um let me start by um the talk<br>this evening by giving you just a little<br>uh bit of an understanding of where my<br>personal Journey uh began I Won't Go<br>Back at sometimes people go back a long<br>way in history I won't don't plan to do<br>that<br>tonight um I want to start with my<br>1958 uh mom went to<br>Fairbank uh girls school dad went to<br>Brighton Grammar School uh they both<br>lived in Brighton which is a a suburb in<br>Melbourne um by<br>1960 they were in Dad's uh dad's words<br>going steady with one<br>1967 they were<br>married um by the way apologies for<br>these sort of um blurry photos but I do<br>want to take have another shout out at<br>this point to Russell buckton who used a<br>little bit of AI to improve the phos on<br>here tonight so thanks<br>Russell um so in 196 68 I was born you<br>can probably tell from these uh these<br>photos my parents were really um came<br>into themselves in the<br>60s uh in<br>1969 they moved into what became our<br>family home in uh 61 Katherine Avenue<br>Mount wavely Mount wavely uh by the way<br>was a suburb just adjacent to Clayton<br>which is uh where the main campus of<br>Mones University<br>is we lived uh in that family home uh<br>all of our<br>1970 my first brother aunt was<br>born and exactly 8 years after I was<br>born to the Day in<br>1976 my third brother Greg was born and<br>there we all are in I guess the late<br>1970s uh with<br>Mom looking very serious I guess the<br>1970s were a serious<br>time uh mom and dad had a huge influence<br>on my life um in in two related<br>ways it was my parents valued very<br>deeply uh education and in particular<br>tertiary education<br>and it was that value that was<br>inculcated or just ingrained into us uh<br>from a very early age that really uh<br>really did mean that I was uh I did feel<br>like it was not really an option that I<br>not come to<br>University uh but the other value uh<br>that Dad well both mom and dad really<br>fostered in US was the value of the<br>creative arts and dad in particular the<br>value of literature and uh it's because<br>of him I I have a love of literature and<br>it really is a a a deep love but it was<br>one that came to me late in life as a um<br>as a high school student I really didn't<br>enjoy reading but uh I guess towards the<br>very end I started to and now I can't um<br>two I just want to tell you a little bit<br>about the value of Education that came<br>from my<br>can and there we<br>go<br>um Mom let me start with mom mom<br>really wanted to go to university that<br>was some she she had a very strong to<br>desire to<br>go that desire unfortunately was<br>thed through no fault of her own mom<br>when she was at high school got nothing<br>but a pluses for every single class she<br>took much to the Chagrin of her younger<br>brother who really couldn't understand<br>why she enjoyed school so<br>much she wanted to go to university<br>and made no bones about it she didn't<br>hide it but in<br>1960 when she would have uh when she was<br>looking to go less than<br>20%<br>of uh less than 20% of the places that<br>tertiary education were occupied by<br>women it's very different<br>today and less than Not only was the<br>proportion so much lower the absolute<br>number of people going to University at<br>the time was so much slower as well<br>there were at the time fewer than<br>9,000<br>females at univers at doing a bachelor's<br>degree across the whole of<br>Australia so it wasn't something uh<br>something women were expected to do back<br>then they were expected I guess to be<br>housewise in that context mom's dad took<br>her out of furbank her High School um<br>the year before her final year so she<br>had no opportunity to be admitted to<br>University nonetheless it didn't stop<br>her pursuing tertiary education so once<br>she finished school she could enroll at<br>Tac Teachers College that's what what<br>you see up there and that's exactly what<br>she did now that was in 1960 and that<br>was no small feedback then uh it might<br>seem seem like a straightforward thing<br>but in 19 it was only in 1956 a few<br>years<br>before that women who were married were<br>allowed to uh uh to be teachers so if<br>you were a teacher in N before 1956 in<br>Australia the moment you got married you<br>had to resign any permanent position uh<br>in in uh at school it's hard to believe<br>uh now and it it's uh at that time there<br>was also something known as the marriage<br>bar in the public service and the<br>marriage bar basically said the same<br>thing if you had a role in the public<br>service if you you had such a role you<br>had to resign<br>if you got married that was abolished a<br>year or so later but you can see it was<br>not an easy time to get uh a role in the<br>then Dad had it a little easier<br>um Dad enrolled at Melbourne University<br>in<br>1961 in a Bachelor of<br>Arts uh and he he completed a Bachelor<br>of Arts with honors majoring in English<br>literature and minoring in pure<br>1965 dad enjoyed his time at University<br>very<br>much he uh he enjoyed it so much he went<br>back in<br>1965 to Melbourne University again and<br>uh and got a uh sorry in 1969<br>and enrolled in a graduate diploma in<br>teaching and graduated in<br>1970 but he didn't stop there in<br>1978 he went back to Melbourne<br>University again and enrolled in what we<br>would call a certificate of<br>proficiency uh to do a course in<br>probability and also to do another<br>course in statistical<br>inference later again he decided to<br>enroll in a course at MES University on<br>computer<br>programming uh these days we might uh we<br>might think about micro<br>credentials uh for continue education<br>and Dad uh you have inspired me to think<br>about opportunities there might be in<br>that<br>space dad's first year at University and<br>thank you thank you for um bearing with<br>me on this uh was was transformative for<br>him he writes in his diary that in many<br>ways and I'm quoting from Dad's diary in<br>many ways the best part of 1960 was<br>taking English sorry Dad en I just<br>realized dad enrolled at University in<br>1960 not<br>61 the best part of 1960 was taking<br>English Lit as a subject Not only was<br>Thomas Hardy on the course including far<br>from the Madding Crowd which I read at<br>least three times as well as several of<br>his other novels but so was King Leah<br>which has has ever since been my<br>favorite Shakespeare play we were lucky<br>to see a professional production of it<br>early in the year other highlights<br>included cha The Poetry of Shelly and<br>others and I think more sha so I guess<br>what I'm I'm trying to to uh pass on to<br>you at the moment is is how much my dad<br>enjoyed l<br>lure in<br>1965 mom uh had completed her her um<br>diploma of Education she had a job and<br>she um she went on a gap here she<br>decided to go to Europe with a number of<br>her<br>friends dad was miserable he didn't<br>enjoy that year at all he didn't enjoy<br>it cuz he missed mom but he wasn't<br>really enjoying other things about<br>University life at that stage but he did<br>did really enjoy his honest thesis so he<br>decided to immerse himself in that and<br>Dad decided to write a thesis on Thomas<br>Hardy's uh what he called I think uh uh<br>was it an epic play or uh called the<br>dentists it's<br>um it was written as a play but for very<br>obvious reasons it has never been<br>performed it was it uh was written in<br>three volumes it had 19x it had 130<br>scenes and uh when I looked it up on on<br>uh Amazon today the uh it has 550 pages<br>with reasonably small<br>print it was hard for me to find a read<br>a review<br>online there was one positive review I<br>found from someone who' bought it as a<br>gift for someone else and said it came<br>book Dead's thesis was uh that the main<br>protagonist in the uh in the dentists<br>that's Napoleon<br>bonapart uh was a tragic hero and that<br>claim was vigorously denied by Hardy<br>himself uh but Dad put a lot of uh<br>devoted a thesis to explaining why he<br>thought Hardy was wrong despite the fact<br>that he was the author of the play and<br>no one was going to dispute dead because<br>Hardy wasn't alive anymore and no one<br>play so Mom and Dad so Dad I just want<br>to say too thank you for that because<br>you have you have ingrained in me a<br>passion uh for Thomas Hardy um I I I<br>haven't read and I know I never will the<br>dentists but you have uh you I have an<br>enormous Joy uh reading uh Thomas hard's<br>other shorter<br>novels Mom and Dad's passion for<br>tertiary education I hope is obvious and<br>Dad's passion for literature um is my a<br>love shared by<br>me Dead's Joy was much about it was not<br>just about the dad's joy for University<br>life though was not just about the<br>academic study it was about the<br>experience the student experience of<br>being at Melbourne<br>University<br>um this is a picture of Ormand College<br>in the<br>1960s Orman College uh was where Dad<br>resided in the final two years of his<br>his Bachelor of uh arts degree at<br>Melbourne and he enjoyed the experience<br>immensely he got to stay with uh with<br>some friends he already knew well he<br>made other friends he enjoyed the<br>experience of uh as as we all know uh<br>all students do of the that that<br>experience of having an independent life<br>for the first time<br>dad also met uh some Fascinating People<br>at almond college and uh one of those<br>acquaintances uh not probably not a<br>friend but an acquaintance was uh Peter<br>Singer I'm not sure if uh if how many of<br>you know Peter Singer but he's uh<br>probably<br>Australia's uh most famous uh living<br>philosopher uh he's an<br>ethicist um and I I've had uh<br>intersections with Peter's life as well<br>since I do recall vividly uh a<br>conversation or two with my mom about<br>Peter when I was growing up and I do<br>remember vividly her her calling him a<br>rat bag so there was something that got<br>under his her skin um I I have never<br>quite got to the bottom of whether it<br>was just his ethical views that she had<br>a problem with I guess I'll never<br>know fast forward um fast forward a few<br>DEC<br>decades um I'm nearing the end of my<br>time at school I went to Campbell<br>grammar<br>school um that was a school at which my<br>father uh was a teacher dad was a uh d d<br>because Dad was a teacher there I got uh<br>the opportunity to uh enroll there I<br>think for free um whereas others had to<br>pay it was an elite private school um so<br>others would have had to pay an enormous<br>there I was enormously lucky and<br>privileged to be able to go to<br>campwell uh the the resources there for<br>students were um mind-blowing when I<br>think back on it<br>I didn't really appreciate that at the<br>time uh I didn't enjoy my time at<br>camwell much at<br>all I was a very average student and I<br>was an average student because I checked<br>out I checked out because I didn't enjoy<br>my time there um when I think back on<br>the reasons why I didn't enjoy my time<br>there three come to mind there may be<br>more one was uh I wasn't really people<br>didn't really like the fact fact that I<br>was the son of a a a school teacher<br>there so I was bullied a little<br>bit<br>um on top of that I I did start school<br>too young and my my parents appreciated<br>that there was a choice they faced uh<br>when I was very young and they put put<br>me in enrolled me in school at four<br>years of age and that meant I struggled<br>a little bit as I went through although<br>I was stretched but I I think probably<br>the main reason why I didn't enjoy it<br>was I didn't really gel with the<br>people who I had to mix with the<br>students there<br>because they were<br>extraordinarily<br>privileged and with that kind of<br>privilege without the matur without<br>maturity of of adulthood uh you can be<br>incredibly self- entitled and um I I've<br>just did not uh enjoy that at<br>all so I was not a great student and it<br>was not clear to uh to I guess my<br>parents that uh I was going to go to<br>university but in my mind there wasn't<br>really an option so I was I was<br>determined to go to university I wanted<br>to go to the University of Melbourne<br>like my<br>dad um but I just didn't get the grades<br>to get into Melbourne so I had to go for<br>my second choice uh which<br>was mes University which was just up the<br>road now I can't tell<br>you the<br>absolute Good<br>Fortune uh of of a couple of things that<br>happened at this point so<br>first absolute stroke of good luck that<br>I got to go to monish rather than<br>Melbourne and I'll explain why in a<br>minute the other stroke of good luck was<br>that I didn't really I knew what I<br>wanted to study I wanted to study<br>psychology<br>um but you had to pick other subjects as<br>well and I didn't know what my fourth<br>subject would be and it was only at the<br>very last minute when I knew a couple of<br>other friends were enrolling in<br>philosophy that I decided that I was<br>going to enroll in<br>philosophy um well I didn't know at the<br>time how much I would love philosophy<br>and didn't know at the time how um how<br>awesome the philosophy Department was at<br>uh at Mones<br>University so that's a picture of the<br>menes building that's where the<br>philosophy Department was back then um<br>there's a list of some of the<br>philosophers I worked closely with at<br>MES the philosophers probably will<br>appreciate the caliber of uh of of<br>people up there others may not just a<br>whistle top tour from there there I went<br>to the Australian National<br>University um I got to work with with<br>these people again outstanding caliber<br>of people you'll see some some of them<br>followed me up<br>there um and uh and then from there I<br>went to do my PhD at Princeton<br>University uh so this is a picture of<br>1879 Hall where the philosophy<br>department is<br>located and um<br>and there is a list of the the<br>philosophers I worked quite closely with<br>there as well I'm going to reflect on<br>those lists in a moment not just to say<br>how wonderful those philosophers are cuz<br>they<br>really they really were amazing<br>philosophers but there's another<br>observation I want to make but I'll come<br>back to that um I then uh had my first<br>job at Western Washington<br>University um and there the philosophers<br>uh that was just a small uh<br>University my God what a beautiful part<br>of the world that is uh it's almost as<br>beautiful as New Zealand it was<br>incredible um it was lovely to be there<br>I was at a tenure track job I was there<br>for 3 years before getting uh the job at<br>Victoria University taranga Waka uh in<br>2002 and um and there are my colleagues<br>I want to thank I want to thank all all<br>of these philosophers by the way for the<br>uh the support and influence they've had<br>on my my life it's been uh it's been<br>amazing but the reflection I want to<br>make is that if you I I'm not sure if<br>you noticed it but there is an<br>extraordinary<br>proportion of<br>Bloks in those<br>lists um and I didn't realize quite how<br>significant it was until i' um until I<br>went back and looked at that list for<br>this lecture and every single University<br>I think there were only one or two two<br>if we were lucky women on any of the<br>lists and I do I'm glad that I'm glad at<br>at Taro were at the upper end of the<br>average on that one but so philosophy I<br>I'm I have known for a long time is a<br>discipline that's that's just not doing<br>a good job in this<br>space<br>um there aren't many if any indigenous<br>philosophers<br>either well I do want to tell you a<br>little bit about what I've tried to do I<br>don't know how successful I've been in<br>addressing it just a little little small<br>steps I've tried to take in my time in<br>New Zealand the first thing I did when I<br>got to New Zealand was I did try and uh<br>I did apply for a teaching Grant to try<br>and look deeply at uh at what was<br>happening and why and where um we were<br>losing females cuz in first year we had<br>a proportion of about<br>5050 I'm also very pleased to<br>say that uh my research students uh not<br>not roughly 50% of my my my research<br>students whether they're ma or uh or PhD<br>that I I've supervised have been<br>females but I think from the thing I'm<br>most proud of is the austral Asian<br>Association of philosophy which is the<br>peak body in<br>philosophy uh in<br>australasia it's recently celebrated its<br>100 years I don't know how many El Lia<br>new but I'm not sure if anyone else knew<br>my plan when I first got in was to<br>change the profile of the executive uh<br>and if I could the<br>board um so I was the CEO for about four<br>or five years when I I got there the<br>there was one female and we we she<br>stepped down soon<br>afterwards um so I was determined to uh<br>to make sure that profile changed my<br>Hope was for a little while to have it<br>100% uh females I never got there uh but<br>I was very happy uh to step down and see<br>that profile change quite dramatically<br>and I and the reason I think that's<br>important is I think people can see<br>themselves in the leader leadership<br>group it might change things elsewhere<br>anyway that's all I'll say on that<br>one let me tell you now a little bit<br>about my<br>research as Zach uh Zach has told<br>you uh my research primarily is and it<br>won't be a surprise to you now uh on<br>when I I try and find a theme across it<br>all it's the role that literature can<br>play in discovering truths about the<br>world and as Zach said that's that's a<br>that would be a surprising thing because<br>fiction<br>is is a about engaging your imagination<br>the purpose of fiction is to entertain<br>us it's not to get it the truth you'd be<br>um foolish to think that<br>fiction has a role in asserting things<br>about reality so why should I be<br>interested in that<br>question uh well on my view fiction can<br>tell you a lot of not just a lot of<br>things about the world it can tell you a<br>lot of interest interesting things about<br>the world and I want to tell you just<br>about just<br>one interesting thing you can learn from<br>fiction<br>tonight um and it's just a part of my<br>research but it's it's one I'm I find<br>myself coming back too often and it's<br>got to do with a fact about our<br>psychology and our engagement with<br>fiction and it's a puzzling thing to<br>to illustrate the idea I'm going to give<br>you a a selection uh from Thomas Hardy's<br>Obscure so Jude and Sue uh have three<br>children they're very poor they're<br>struggling in uh christminster they've<br>just gone out they had a good time<br>they've come back and uh this is what<br>the passage says Jude stood bending over<br>the kettle with his watch in his hand<br>timing the eggs so that his back was<br>turned to the little in inner chamber<br>where the children lay a shriek from Sue<br>suddenly caused him to start around she<br>saw that the door of the room or rather<br>the closet which had seemed to go<br>heavily upon its hinges as he pushed it<br>back was open and that Sue had sunk to<br>the floor just within it hening forward<br>to pick her up he turned his eyes to the<br>little bedspread on the boards no<br>children were<br>there he looked in bewilderment around<br>the room at the back of the door were<br>fixed two hooks for hanging garments and<br>from these the forms of the two youngest<br>children were suspended by a piece of<br>box cord around each of their necks<br>while from a nail a few yards off the<br>body of little Jude was hanging in a<br>similar<br>manner an overturned chair was near the<br>Elder boy and his glazed eyes was was<br>slanted into the room but those of the<br>girl and the baby were<br>closed as I I'm sure you can appreciate<br>with the with the longer narrative this<br>is quite a a disturbing disturbing<br>passage the most disturbing disturbing<br>passage in the novel and the narrative<br>changes after that<br>point I want you to<br>imagine if Hardy had continued the<br>narrative<br>thus and Jude unlike Sue did the right<br>thing by keeping quiet for it's a vice<br>of the worst kind to squeal as suited in<br>such<br>circumstances<br>or and this was all for the good for<br>there were too many children<br>anyway I hope you can<br>appreciate that these last statements<br>which of course Hardy didn't<br>add are very very jarring indeed and<br>there something goes deeply deeply wrong<br>if uh if we added or if anyone try if an<br>that so part of what I want to talk<br>about tonight is what's problematic<br>statements let me start by saying that<br>the<br>problem is is uniquely about the moral<br>nature or the evaluative nature of the<br>claims at the end I mean there are the<br>problems perhaps with it but that is one<br>of the problems with the claims the the<br>Bold claims<br>there and the idea is this when we<br>engage with<br>fiction an author has the capacity to<br>engage Us in<br>imagination on the wildest most<br>speculative claims possible an author<br>can say that their characters travel<br>backwards in time and change the past an<br>author can talk about in adamant objects<br>talking to one another and we have no<br>trouble engaging with those things even<br>though they're<br>impossible but when an author tries to<br>make a moral claim that jars with the<br>CLA the morality that We believe We<br>resist we don't we don't imagine what<br>cases this puzzle is wide has been<br>centuries re in recent times since about<br>the 1990s the puzzle has come to be<br>known as the puzzle of imaginative<br>resistance but David Hume over 250 years<br>ago long before Thomas Hardy was even<br>born notice the<br>problem this is what he said in uh a<br>passage towards the end of his famous<br>work of the standards of taste and I<br>quote whatever deviations from fact are<br>found in fiction they detract but little<br>from the value of those compositions<br>there needs but a certain turn of<br>thought or imagination to relish the<br>sentiment or conclusions derived from<br>them but a very violent effort is<br>requisite to change our judgment and<br>manners and excite Sentiments of<br>approbation or blame love or hatred<br>different from those for which the Mind<br>from long custom has been familiarized<br>and where a man is confident of the<br>rectitude of that moral standard by<br>which he judges he is justly jealous of<br>it and will not pervert the sentiments<br>of his heart for a moment in comp sence<br>quote recent interest in this puzzle has<br>revolved to quite a large<br>extent from in<br>disentangling a myriad of puzzles that<br>Hume conflates in that single passage<br>and all of them are genuine puzzles so<br>let me try and outline them for you very<br>quickly<br>actually I've got the order of I've just<br>realized I've got the wrong set of<br>slides here um before I outline them for<br>you let me take special care to try and<br>persuade you that there is a genuine<br>puzzle here by pointing out that the<br>puzzle that Hume is pointing<br>to is not one of these puzzles which<br>aren't puzzles at all so for example<br>it's not the puzzle of explain why<br>readers can't imagine morally bad things<br>happening as they're described in<br>fiction because morally bad things<br>happen all the time in fiction that's<br>not that's not a puzzle that needs to be<br>explained at all if you read any novels<br>written in the 19th century or almost<br>any if you read Hardy or Doki or TL sto<br>or Dickens all of these writers took<br>great pleasure in describing how bad the<br>Human Condition was so it's not a puzzle<br>about explaining how bad things happen<br>moreover it's not a puzzle about<br>explaining why we can't imagine<br>characters and narrators having deviant<br>moral points of view we know that<br>happens all the time as well we know if<br>you read um uh uh if you read Lolita and<br>you think about the uh the character<br>hbert hbert you you know that there are<br>all the time characters in fiction that<br>view and it's also not the puzzle of<br>explaining why readers can't desire<br>morally bad things to happen in<br>imagination okay there are lots of<br>occasions where you as a reader might<br>actually enjoy the experience of wanting<br>bad things to happen uh Charles pigdon<br>who wrote to me on the weekend described<br>just such a situation it was a situation<br>where you think about The Sopranos you<br>think about the the um the mafia moral<br>code um you want you you you in<br>imagination by into that and you want<br>that um you want Tony the main character<br>uh to to buy into the code that's that's<br>explain the puzzle or the puzzles we're<br>trying to explain in<br>Hume require us to think about an<br>alternative morality because notice in<br>all of those Furious cases we hold<br>morality fixed the moral truths remain<br>the same we just see that other that<br>morality the world isn't always a good<br>place or that people sometimes do bad<br>things but morality stays the same what<br>human what Hume is asking us to do is to<br>wrong there are a whole lot of things<br>that go<br>wrong one of the things that goes wrong<br>is sometimes when you have a fiction<br>that's like that is we think there's an<br>a not the moral problem in the fiction<br>is also an aesthetic flaw so if you<br>think about maybe Lenny rifen stol's uh<br>Triumph of the will advocating a kind of<br>uh<br>Nazi propaganda film there that you<br>might think in those cases that the<br>moral the moral claims made in the work<br>actually make it an aesthetically fla in<br>some way and so the puzzle there's a<br>puzzle about explaining why that might<br>be the case there's a puzzle about<br>explaining why we feel funny why why we<br>have the the the particular feelings<br>that we do the the repulsion that we do<br>when authors make deviant moral claims<br>in their<br>works and there's a puzzle about the<br>author's control over their f and<br>whether or not they can actually control<br>the content of their fiction when they<br>talk about deviant alternative<br>moralities none of these problems are<br>the problems I'm uh that go under the<br>name the puzzle of imaginative<br>resistance the puzzle of imaginative<br>resistance is a puzzle about explaining<br>a failure of our imaginative<br>engagement when it comes to an author<br>inviting us to imagine that alternative<br>morality<br>holds okay and it's it's it's a puzzle<br>because there is no such barrier in our<br>imagination when it comes to wildly<br>implausible perhaps possible descriptive<br>puzzle how do I know how how does I know<br>how does hum know how does anyone else<br>know that that claim about um morality<br>is in fact<br>true well it's all anecdotal it's all<br>all it's based on the intuitions of<br>philosophers and philosophers traffick<br>in intuitions but one of the most<br>remarkable things about this particular<br>case is that there is an overwhelming<br>consensus of philosophical opinion on<br>this particular<br>issue um there<br>are there there are scores of people who<br>write on this problem and almost<br>universally every published piece has<br>agreed that there is a phenomenon here<br>that needs<br>explaining um there are a few outlier<br>papers I could find three which seem to<br>claim that there's no problem here or<br>that there's no asymmetry here but in<br>each and every one of them if you look<br>and you actually read the paper they're<br>talking about another<br>puzzle or they think it's not or they<br>think they just think they can explain<br>it that's not to say that there's not a<br>an asymmetry there there not to say that<br>no one thinks that uh there isn't a<br>genuine asymmetry there just I hope you<br>don't mind me quoting you Charles on<br>Sunday he wrote The Following to me<br>the second proposition that's that's the<br>second claim there seems to be just<br>about as obviously false as a statement<br>about our responses to fiction can very<br>well be so I know there are at least<br>some philosophers who disagree with the<br>asymmetry and Charles they maybe a paper<br>there for you<br>um but here are just a couple of<br>citations to back that up you'll see if<br>you look at these uh these philosophers<br>they say quite explicitly that it's just<br>their<br>intuitions that uh that back it up for<br>those of you who are still not convinced<br>though there's an extra there's a<br>growing literature in social<br>psychology actually testing in various<br>different ways that very hypothesis and<br>every single one of those papers listed<br>there in a different way gives empirical<br>evidence that there is an asymmetry here<br>so it's a<br>explained<br>um let me finish this piece by telling<br>you a little bit about what remains to<br>be done so if there's a genuine<br>asymmetry there we need to be able to<br>explain why there's an asymmetry there<br>what gives rise to<br>our resistance or failure to imagine<br>deviant moral claims being<br>true if we're invited to do so in<br>fiction<br>and the<br>literature suggests that there are three<br>high level kinds of explanation you<br>might be able to<br>offer I I use a terminology here from<br>Tamar gendler who's quite uh who's<br>written some very important papers in<br>the this um this area so I don't take<br>credit for it myself the F the first<br>kind of um the first kind of explanation<br>is what she calls<br>onanism and that kind of explanation<br>which is one she advances suggests that<br>the reason readers fail to take up an<br>author's in invitation to<br>imagine a deviant moral claim being<br>true is because they're unwilling to do<br>so it's because it's something they<br>don't want to do um and because they<br>don't want to do it they literally<br>resist<br>imagining what the author is inviting<br>them to imagine<br>for various reasons I don't buy that<br>explanation but I won't go into that<br>today the second kind of explanation<br>which is probably even more popular than<br>the first is called<br>cism and according to that explanation<br>readers fail to take up the author's<br>invitation to imagine deviant moral<br>claims being true because it not because<br>they don't want to they might want to<br>well enough it's just that they find<br>themselves unable to do so there's<br>something preventing them from uh<br>imagining what they're invited to<br>imagine and and it might be because<br>there's some conceptual<br>impossibility in the invit in sort of in<br>the invitation as it's presented to them<br>and as a consequence they can't imagine<br>it if you if you adopt that kind of<br>explanation though you need to carefully<br>explain why the conceptual impossibility<br>here is a barrier but it's not in uh in<br>the descriptive<br>case and the final kind of explanation<br>this is the one I I I tend to find most<br>plausible though I I will explain that<br>there are other options available is uh<br>is a position position called hardian<br>ISM that's my terminology<br>um and that's the the kind of<br>explanation that readers failed to take<br>up and author's invitation to imagine<br>deviant moral claims being<br>true because not because it's because<br>they don't want to they might want to<br>well enough and it's not because they<br>can't um they they may be able to if<br>they try hard enough or if the author<br>helps them uh with their narrative in a<br>folsome enough way but it's difficult to<br>do so there are certain barriers there<br>to imagination that need to be overcome<br>now obviously no matter which kind of<br>explanation you adopt you're going to<br>have to go into more details and there<br>are lots of different ways you can do<br>that I want to finish this part of the<br>talk by saying that one of the things I<br>try and do in a number of papers I've<br>written in this literature is to say<br>that's not the<br>only um that's not the only possible<br>kind of solution you can adopt because<br>all of the solutions just outlined make<br>two<br>presuppositions the first one is that<br>any statement within a<br>fiction is an invitation by an<br>author of the fiction to imagine the<br>content of what's<br>said and the second is that the reader<br>recognizes this intention on the part of<br>the author and I look at in my work on<br>on the topic I look at a lot of<br>different ways you might deny one of<br>those two<br>assumptions and find plausible ways in<br>my view and and find alternative<br>solutions to the to the puzzle um but I<br>won't have time to go through those<br>tonight let me<br>finish by giving very briefly and I'm<br>recognizing I'm out of time so I'll be<br>very quick um some uh<br>some comments on my vision for Learning<br>and<br>teaching so the first thing I want to<br>note before I give you my<br>Reflections is that there are a lot of<br>really good things about um about<br>learning and teaching at at Taro uh but<br>also a lot of really good things about<br>the student experience at a Tigo and<br>having a good student experience for a<br>whole lot of reasons is good for your<br>education<br>this is a photo of the toga party last<br>uh this earlier this<br>year couple of observations I want to<br>make first observation we don't want we<br>don't want to think only about learning<br>and teaching which we do want to think<br>about we do need to think very carefully<br>about the student experience because<br>that's part of the reason that students<br>come and enroll at a Targo but the other<br>thing we have to think about is is uh<br>how to do that well and so that's uh<br>that's a uh something we really need to<br>think hard about going forward and I<br>could talk about that for a whole hour<br>um but know that we need a new On's view<br>around<br>that the second thing I want to note and<br>we don't need actually we do need a<br>little bit of a Nuance view around this<br>we do extraordinarily well at a Targo<br>and I don't want us to lose sight of<br>this on all of the<br>Equity measures that that Tec or we<br>should care about in terms of multi<br>success rates and success rates in terms<br>of Pacifica success rates uh in terms of<br>Student Success in terms of other Equity<br>Group successes we do we on every single<br>measure shoot above the average uh we<br>are either first or second and I think<br>we need to for whatever reason we do<br>that we need to congratulate ourselves<br>for<br>that but I think we do also have an<br>opportunity to enhance what we do really<br>well so that's something I'll be looking<br>at as<br>well I want to reflect back to you the<br>themes I've got in my first 90 days at<br>the University so I've got feedback from<br>students they've been very clear that<br>they have three priorities and they're<br>going to push hard this year one is<br>around class reps and teaching<br>evaluations they want to make sure that<br>our class reps have a role in putting<br>some of those teaching some of those<br>questions in the teaching evaluation<br>forms so we've already started looking<br>at how that can be done in a in a<br>positive and good<br>way they want clear communication about<br>courses and program offerings in future<br>years because they're worried about the<br>management of change processes that have<br>happened and now they feel confused<br>about we've got so many causes on the<br>books why aren't we offer why why are we<br>offering so few how can I make<br>predictions about what I should enroll<br>in in future years I think it's a really<br>good idea for us to be clear in our<br>Communications as far as we can so I'm<br>working with them on<br>that the third thing they have been<br>pushing me on very hard is advocacy for<br>universal access to lecture recordings<br>and close captioning so I will be<br>thinking about that this year so uh just<br>that's just a heads<br>up I won't go into the staff advice uh<br>in detail today but here are nine themes<br>that have come through uh uh the advice<br>that's come to me and I should tell you<br>I got I've continued to get advice I I<br>got the last email about hour before I<br>came<br>here these are all good suggestions<br>these are all good ideas and the many of<br>them were made by more than one uh staff<br>member I want you to know one of the<br>most uh gratifying things from my<br>perspective is that as I start looking<br>into these I think I can help possibly<br>with every one of them and I should say<br>when I I should say when I say I can<br>help often what I I do is just ping some<br>of these off to other members of staff<br>and say can you help and they come back<br>and they're great they say yes yes I can<br>so I don't know is Joe here<br>tonight is Joe Joe Joe I do want to<br>thank you for helping with with some of<br>these so thank you very much<br>um I do have to think about the at Taro<br>teaching and learning plan it will be<br>part of P the domain plan for Pata<br>um but I do also want to say and this is<br>my last slide when I think about it and<br>this is the long bow I was hoping to<br>draw um when I think about my talk what<br>what can I learn from my talk that will<br>help me develop that<br>plan well I want to say first that<br>there's a link here to our imagination<br>because I think in order to lift<br>ourselves up and develop a a learning<br>and teaching plan strategy we need to<br>think Beyond just the small things we<br>need to to to have a big picture and<br>have blue skies thinking and capture the<br>imagination of Staff professional staff<br>academic staff and students as we do<br>that so we've got to engage with our<br>imagination my<br>responsibility uh will be to make clear<br>that I'm actually inviting staff to<br>contri contribute to that implementation<br>it's not just a a top down uh approach I<br>don't think it will work well if it's<br>just uh managed in a small back room uh<br>by me and a couple of others it has to<br>be something that engages all staff<br>across the<br>university I need to go from oneism to<br>wuism I need to get people to want to do<br>this uh and that requires me to engage<br>with the goals and aspirations and<br>values of our staff I might not be able<br>to engage with everybody's goals and<br>values and<br>motivations because we have such a<br>desperate um and and that's that's one<br>of the most wonderful thing things about<br>a university there it's very hard to get<br>a consensus on anything but I do need to<br>make sure that I talk to you all and<br>need to and I need to be able to carry<br>as many of you with me as I can<br>and the final thing I want to say I want<br>to move from cism to<br>cism and by that what I mean is I think<br>what we need to do is primarily focus on<br>the aspirations the goals the outcomes<br>that we want rather than focusing on the<br>barriers and on the reasons why we can't<br>do any of these things because I think<br>that gets the order wrong if you focus<br>first on on those things and just give<br>up you you're not going to get anywhere<br>what I think you really need to do is<br>work out where you really want to get to<br>and then focus on taking away the<br>barriers as we can so that's not uh it<br>doesn't give you much of a list on what<br>I'm I'm planning to do it just tells you<br>a little bit about my<br>Approach but I've only had a little over<br>90 days here so uh now's my time to<br>start think about it thank you all very<br>very<br>much thank you Stuart for your excellent<br>lecture I think you um have challenged<br>us and made us all think in one way or<br>another so thank you um it was lovely to<br>hear about your personal journey and it<br>really brings back that our family<br>history and family values play such an<br>important part in who we are and I think<br>for you hearing about the value that<br>your parents set on education and<br>literature has really made a difference<br>and I guess it makes us all think<br>especially those of us who are parents<br>as to how we have or can influence our<br>Offspring hopefully for the better<br>um and for me talking about Hardy I grew<br>up not far from where Hardy lived so it<br>was it was lovely to hear about Thomas<br>Hardy<br>um I'm reflecting that as part of the<br>interview process for our dvcs we don't<br>often spend a lot of time talking about<br>their research although we expect them<br>to be research active so it's it's<br>interesting to hear your research and<br>perhaps we should get all new people to<br>give lectures as well um I think your<br>discussion of puzzles and imaginative<br>resistance was fascinating and provides<br>much food for thought and um I'm going<br>to be really challenged I think next<br>time I sit down and read a good book so<br>um I think thank<br>you and your link to imagining how<br>things could be different in a in a<br>practical way for the University I think<br>was uh was a long bow but thank you um<br>and and the importance of both student<br>exper experience as well as learning and<br>teaching is what you said uh thank you<br>for asking students and staff what their<br>priorities are because I think it's an<br>important thing that we actually engage<br>and engagement is really key if we want<br>to make a difference in the future so<br>thank you very much and I have a small</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
