to autism and altero this<br>is the third of our Series today brought<br>to you by Victoria University and we've<br>got a lovely panel today all with really<br>interesting fascinating stories we've<br>also got Matt on a video he has<br>pre-recorded answers so we'll be<br>discussing those as<br>well Koto called Michelle Stevens CH Ina<br>I am a speech language therapist I work<br>at Autism New Zealand and for the autism<br>clinic with Victoria University my<br>special interest is autism and I feel<br>very privileged to work with so many<br>amazing people hey I'm RJ I'm a<br>transgender Heim pronouns and I'm<br>probably here cuz I got diagnosed about<br>4 weeks ago with autism so I went<br>through my entire Education Without<br>diagnosis and so you get to hear all<br>about that K I'm Philippa I work with<br>autistic children in Theo but today I'm<br>here representing my own neurod<br>Divergent family in particular my toe<br>autistic children hi I'm Rey I use any<br>pronouns um I'm an autistic and multiply<br>disabled and neurod Divergent person I<br>worked for the Ministry of Education for<br>2 years as a lived experience adviser um<br>and I'm really passionate about the<br>well-being and learning of disabled<br>young people hello my name is Matthew I<br>am atic and I am a special Olympian I<br>won won a medal silver and a bronze and<br>the 2023 special Olympian World Games in<br>bing tell me about your or your child's<br>experience in the education system watch<br>all right let's see what Matt has say I<br>started kindy at bport at 3 and a half<br>my brothers had all gone to Island Bay<br>but Mom was white it was too big and not<br>safe enough I was a runner so B po Cy<br>was great for<br>me I had a special teach rade called<br>Marian just for me when I I was five I<br>went to St Francis to our school that<br>was 2001 over the years I had lots of<br>teachers and teach<br>I stayed at St Francis to school until I<br>was 12 that was 2008 then 2009 I went to<br>horo residential Co college for two<br>years it was a boarding school it was<br>hard at first and that I got used to it<br>after hor well I went to wington high<br>from 2010 until<br>2016 I also went to IC for 2<br>years um so I'll talk about me I don't<br>have a child I'm autistic uh so I went<br>through my entire education system<br>without knowing I was autistic I<br>realized that I might be back in first<br>year of University and for the next four<br>years I attempted to get a diagnosis and<br>literally on my last day I got my<br>diagnosis appointment thank<br>you and they said yep you are like cool<br>that would have be nice four years ago<br>or 10 years ago but this is awesome as<br>well so yeah I didn't have any<br>accommodations and I was just sort of<br>drifting in the ocean for most of uni<br>thinking probably maybe but I don't feel<br>confident enough to actually look for<br>help or use the right terminology<br>because I don't have that official yeah<br>totally so you know that thing where uh<br>kids will be really in primary school<br>and then go on high school and like feel<br>not talented anymore cuz they're no<br>longer the gifted kids I actually had<br>the opposite I sucked in primary school<br>I couldn't do anything my basic addition<br>multiplication spelling it's all<br>terrible like my little siblings they're<br>all under 10 they literally have a<br>better understanding at the moment of<br>those basic principles than I do now and<br>so I was always taken out into those I<br>don't know if every uh school did this<br>but ours was literally like you get<br>taken out of the main class and put into<br>the little hallway and that's just like<br>one teacher one-on-one for like three<br>students saying okay this is how you<br>spell dog but in high school it was like<br>a switch flick I'm really good at<br>writing I'm a really good writer I can<br>type like nothing else I was getting<br>really good grades not without a fair<br>share of tears and uh stress but I was I<br>could do it finally and I just sort of<br>made my entire education around that so<br>that was high school for me I passed<br>that and when I uh I've always liked art<br>I've liked animals I decided to look at<br>design which is uh drawings and looking<br>at products and taking products apart<br>and learning how to improve products so<br>those are like hits all the hyper<br>my my University degree is<br>actually weird<br>because I am the first student of it<br>they've created a new thing at my<br>University which is basically a<br>combination of two courses so I decided<br>to combine industrial design which is<br>the making of products making of things<br>Vehicles boats to water bottles and<br>concept design which is the initial<br>stages of game design animation uh<br>movies and such it's really cool right<br>that's really cool it's really cool I<br>got to do my funky little drawings and I<br>got to go to my other class and make<br>chairs so I got to combine the two of<br>those and that was a really interesting<br>course because I didn't have a class for<br>a lot of it it was very much a you are<br>the first student ever doing this and<br>you are the only student doing this in<br>your year so you are the front runner<br>you have to make all the decisions you<br>have no one to guide you besides a<br>one-on-one hour lecture that you have<br>with the guy running it so I was doing<br>all that sort of myself and I could<br>follow completely my own schedule and<br>that worked really well for me so<br>basically jump into a class if I wanted<br>to but most of the time I was at home<br>making things and I did uh not to sound<br>overconfident I did really well awesome<br>yeah so that's uh sort of how my<br>education went it was very much bad<br>better cuz I had at least something I<br>could do in it and I it did all my<br>classes around that and then really good<br>because I was doing something I was<br>interested and passionate in and while<br>everybody else was dying at the end of<br>the year trying log through it I'd come<br>in all smil and Havey like guys I made<br>another toy he be like good job AJ we're<br>going to go<br>sleep but isn't that just such a<br>beautiful example of how um how the<br>system around you can influence how you<br>feel about yourself as a learner and<br>when you've given space to be creative<br>and follow what you're interested in<br>you're so successful mhm exactly cuz<br>nobody would have predicted when I was a<br>kid that I would go on to be able to<br>accept sell in a class yes I did that's<br>awesome I was really inspired RJ when um<br>I found out about how you took<br>your what you were really passionate<br>about and you made it into essentially<br>you went and said this is what I want to<br>do and you made it happen and I think<br>that would be I know for me it would be<br>really intimidating um and just kind of<br>having making something out of from<br>scrap but it sounds like it really<br>motivated you and you were really good<br>at organizing those fun kind of things<br>so do you were you intimidated at all or<br>did you find like I guess the world is<br>my oyster I think I was intimidated but<br>also not as much as you would think like<br>I say I was doing all I was doing really<br>well but I was also absolutely exhausted<br>and sort of falling apart mentally a lot<br>of the time so I'd walk in I'd be like<br>Ugh dying and both of classes ran at the<br>same time my two majors ran at the same<br>time so I'd either have to do uh an hour<br>and that an hour and that an hour and<br>that or just miss out<br>so I was running back and forth between<br>buildings and it'd be RJ what are you<br>doing to yourself and i' like I'm having<br>fun just not in classes and yeah as the<br>years went on and as especially this<br>year happened I started trying to do<br>that run back and forth between<br>buildings absolutely burnt myself out<br>couldn't do it and so for the last<br>semester I went up to my lectures and<br>said I cannot be in class anymore I<br>literally am having a mental breakdown<br>with within 2 hours of being out of the<br>house I can't show up I can't do any of<br>this but I will do the work you know I<br>will do the work so I basically did not<br>go to university at all for the past 6<br>months because I was just at home doing<br>the things and I'd only go in if I<br>needed to use the workshop or particular<br>uh resources and I could I could do it<br>perfectly selfmotivated but I<br>couldn't uh work within a structure<br>anymore I couldn't work within an<br>education<br>system and so not only were you<br>University student but you're also your<br>own advocate so you were doing a lot of<br>things at once but um I think it's a<br>really good example of how being able to<br>know what you can do and what your<br>strengths are and presenting those and<br>say I can do this yeah I think it also<br>did help that because I was the only<br>student in this and I could essentially<br>do whatever I want as long as I had that<br>consultancy and let my lectures and<br>everything know this is where I'm at<br>this is what I'm doing I'm fine I could<br>sort of mold the educ structure that I<br>was in to my needs and that was really<br>really useful I wouldn't have been able<br>to do it without being able to do that<br>yeah it's a great story that's awesome<br>graduation so I'm here as a parent<br>speaking about um my experiences<br>parenting young autistic children and<br>just acknowledging that we're really<br>early on in our journey so my autistic<br>children are six and two um um and I am<br>listening very carefully as I always do<br>to autistic adults who have been through<br>the education system because I'm taking<br>learnings from um their experiences and<br>hoping to carve out something really<br>positive for my kids we have had a real<br>mixed bag of experiences um we've had a<br>couple of settings that have been really<br>beautiful and worked really well where I<br>felt my kids were being uh appreciated<br>for who they are really well understood<br>really well supported and it was still<br>challenging you know there's still bumps<br>along the road especially when you're<br>talking about a big system with a lot of<br>kids in an environment that isn't<br>necessarily set up for autistic kids um<br>but we have had a few years that have<br>gone really well and on the flip side<br>we've had a year that went really<br>terribly and so I guess as a parent I've<br>also had the examp um the experience of<br>seeing the effect that uh poor placement<br>in education system has on my children's<br>mental health and their well-being their<br>physical health and so we've had a a<br>year rebuilding and um home Skilling to<br>kind of build back up from that so mixed<br>bag so far but I'm hopeful with our next<br>placement we have another good<br>experience how are you feeling like<br>homeschooling is working for you cuz<br>I've always looked at like yeah that<br>could have been useful but I've also<br>looked at my parents and how we had<br>interacted over homework which is<br>a whole thing on its own and that was<br>just always a nightmare so it seems good<br>and like how was I was saying my<br>education at for the last part of uni I<br>could structure it to my needs and that<br>seems like a good thing for<br>homeschooling but I'm not sure how<br>that's working in practice for you yeah<br>I think you have to consider the whole<br>family hey and we've got um a little bit<br>of privilege in our house that meant<br>that we could homeschool a lot of people<br>just don't have that option um I don't<br>feel like we were a family of born<br>homeschoolers it's not my passion and<br>it's not my plan to keep them separate<br>from the education system but I feel<br>that um yeah my eldest really needed<br>that time away from school just to<br>rebuild his confidence and his physical<br>health um because an anxiety takes a<br>huge toll on a little body um and I<br>guess we were winging the homeschooling<br>a little bit and doing it in our own<br>space and time to borrow some<br>terminology um I'm expecting our<br>educational journey to be a little bit<br>creative we might not follow a clear<br>linear path so um I can imagine we might<br>have times where we dip in and out of<br>homeschooling as we need to yeah that<br>sounds like a good<br>idea it's our experience with it how old<br>are your kids now uh my eldest is<br>six my middle child is four they are not<br>autistic they're in a little autistic<br>sandwich and my youngest is two<br>yeah and I guess it's just they're tiny<br>they're tiny they're right at the<br>beginning um but in saying<br>that education and experiences in<br>community are profoundly important when<br>they're young and they teach you a lot<br>about how you understand yourself and<br>how you can have relationships with<br>other people so they're really critical<br>years and to me it's really important<br>that they're going well and just the<br>huge toll that you can see when they<br>don't go well<br>um yeah it's very important a child is a<br>person I definitely in my work get um to<br>work with um uh several uh teenagers<br>female teenagers um I love working with<br>teenagers um and I see them they and<br>they did that road alone you know they<br>didn't have the parent that maybe was<br>able to say hey what's going on here you<br>know and get in there whereas they might<br>have had the felt of not have had the<br>confidence to do that and I think your<br>background has hopefully supported you<br>in that in feeling that way um and when<br>a lot of times it gets that intermediate<br>time or that college time and suddenly<br>everything to a parent perspective of<br>suddenly they can't go to school you<br>know they aren't able to do the things<br>that they were used to do their<br>interests change and it's really<br>traumatic for the parent for the child<br>as well obviously but sometimes it's<br>this disconnect like I as a parent<br>sometimes it's like what have I done<br>wrong how have I not supported how have<br>I not facilitated and I know how that<br>feels as a parent whereas the child's<br>just like it has nothing to do with you<br>and uh what I try to do is support them<br>to come on to the same page and look at<br>the different aspects to see what is it<br>what is it that's really difficult for<br>you so that then we can make some steps<br>towards and there's no rush either but<br>towards you being able to access what<br>you want to access in the way that you<br>want to access it so it's like<br>rebuilding but I think it's amazing<br>you've started that at your child's very<br>young age um and I think it's really<br>Brave too because it's not always easy I<br>think there's a lot of value in just<br>knowing that your parents are there to<br>support you and that they are willing to<br>take a massive step into homeschooling<br>just so you will be comfortable I say<br>just like it's a little thing so you<br>will be comfortable and I think that's<br>just a really amazing thing that you're<br>doing knowing that you're not going to<br>be alone and you're not going<br>to be cast out or so just try harder if<br>you can't do a thing if you're<br>struggling yeah I think the stakes are<br>pretty high though I don't necessarily<br>felt like we had a choice to continue<br>school um this year you know there was a<br>lot of physical unwellness and high<br>anxiety and I didn't feel like school<br>was safe at that point which is really<br>sad to say I think it's still Brave to<br>go on the journey that you had to go on<br>I think I glossed over in my notes<br>Primary School entirely CU I didn't<br>remember most of it<br>um I went to I think eight different<br>primary schools cuz we moved a bunch um<br>I did all right I was good at making<br>friends quickly I did really good at<br>like English subjects<br>um not so well at maths cuz I couldn't<br>memorize all of the things you had to<br>memorize very well so whenever they were<br>doing like the basic fact sheets<br>everyone else would look at it and just<br>remember the answer but I would be<br>actually working out each individual<br>question in my head so I did it like<br>five times as slow as everyone else um<br>they sort of sometimes didn't really<br>know what to do with me like if I could<br>spell all the words in the group they<br>were like I guess you can go into that<br>other classroom and draw Celtic knots<br>instead of doing English lessons and I<br>okay or I could do something<br>else I don't know it feels like a good<br>tradeoff yeah or i' be like educational<br>or I'd be like 8 years old and they were<br>like man you can read this book so<br>quickly maybe instead you could do like<br>a self-directed essay about mountain<br>gorillas but I was eight so I didn't<br>know how to do a self-directed essay<br>about mountain gorillas so I just drew a<br>picture of mountain gorillas for three<br>months it was a really good picture um<br>but yeah anyway um there were a few<br>situations where teachers just sort of<br>like didn't really know how to meet me<br>in the middle and gave me a weird task<br>to pass the time while they taught the<br>rest of the students primary school was<br>okay I did okay at it I found<br>that didn't have to work very hard to<br>figure out how to do the assignments I<br>was given um which wasn't something that<br>stuck um in high school I was pretty<br>much instantly having like major<br>shutdown episodes every single day in<br>every single class um and it got to<br>where they were like here is this card<br>that you can show the teachers so you<br>can leave the classroom whenever you<br>want and sit in the wholeway and make<br>yourself normal again um and then it got<br>to the point where all the teachers knew<br>that I had that so I didn't have to show<br>them and then I just stopped going to<br>class and then my attendance in year 11<br>was like 11% um and in year 13 I got<br>like not expelled but sort of expelled<br>for lack of attendance cuz I just didn't<br>show up for three months um I like<br>stopped going or left High School about<br>five times um two of those times I went<br>to uh Central Regional Health School in<br>the city um and I was there which is<br>like a<br>um school that teaches you how to go<br>back to school doing the kind of visits<br>and things that you guys do but more<br>like structured um and it was all right<br>the first time and then worse the second<br>time um the second time I didn't like it<br>so I left in the middle of the day and<br>got a train back to my high school and<br>was like hey can I come back and they<br>were like No And I was like please and<br>they were like okay um<br>and the power of please yeah and then I<br>dropped out again<br>um um after that I went to weltech um<br>and I was there for three months um my<br>teacher at weltech I was studying hair<br>um and her strategy was she would uh go<br>into the room and she would get up in<br>front of the Whiteboard and she would<br>write like pin curls on the Whiteboard<br>and then she'd turn to you and go look<br>it up on YouTube and then leave the<br>classroom um so I dropped out of that um<br>and I felt very sort of aimless and<br>freaked um and then very quickly after<br>that that got a job at Ministry of<br>Education and felt much less aimless and<br>freaked and now that's been kind of the<br>work I've been doing for the past 3<br>years has been similar stuff cuz once<br>you are in it people are like oh do you<br>want to do this for us do you want to do<br>this for us do you want to do this for<br>us do you want to come be on this<br>discussion panel that they're filming<br>for Autism New Zealand yeah sure thing<br>um yeah that was what education was like<br>for me I found that um in high<br>school people wanted to help but they<br>just did not have the<br>resources or the bandwidth or the<br>understanding of what they could do or<br>like any ideas of how to help they would<br>be like I don't know you're having a<br>hard time with exams do you want to do<br>it alone in a room and I'd be like no<br>and they were like damn okay well good<br>luck<br>then or I would be like I'm having a<br>hard time with the stuff in this<br>classroom and they were like do you want<br>to do a self-directed research project<br>for a whole year and I was like<br>absolutely not and they were like like<br>damn okay good luck then<br>um yeah but I'm not<br>like this is because learning support is<br>terrible and we're screwing me over on<br>purpose they<br>just can't help yeah sound like it was<br>either option A or option b and if that<br>doesn't apply to your brain then well<br>they don't have enough staff and they<br>don't have enough like things that they<br>are allowed to do and they don't have<br>enough bandwidth of able to see you a<br>lot or come up with ideas a lot there's<br>just not<br>much they can help with um but when it<br>works for people that's<br>great and when it<br>doesn't that's less great but you know<br>oh there was a really great um speech<br>language therapist at my high school I<br>know slp's for the win um and she was<br>awesome and she did a lot of like<br>I guess like the stuff that I wish<br>learning support could do for me she was<br>like like the main thing that she wanted<br>to do was just help me to communicate my<br>needs to my teachers and I really<br>appreciated that cuz I didn't I didn't<br>talk for about two maybe two and a half<br>years in high school um so that was how<br>I got to meet her and she was really<br>helpful and wonderful and I'm really<br>grateful for the support that she gave<br>me yeah I you know I have to say that<br>although I come from an ADHD perspective<br>there are so many similarities I mean I<br>know that my child struggled<br>immensely um in college Years and one of<br>the main things was that there were so<br>strict around um what they wore that<br>they finally said you cannot wear a<br>jersey they weren't supposed to wear a<br>jersey and so my child decided to carry<br>it with them and that was seen as<br>complete yeah Disobedience and just very<br>openly quite rude and then when he said<br>give me your jersey they would say no MH<br>and that was even worse and so it was<br>this constant because they needed it<br>with them but they weren't able because<br>they have such high anxiety they weren't<br>able to say I need it because and we<br>talked about it at home and things like<br>that but in the moment they weren't able<br>to do that and I just I'm just it's<br>resonating so much these stories and I<br>think it's a real although this is<br>related to autism I think that<br>neurodivergence can um see the the<br>similarities yeah I mean there's also<br>definitely like um a Power Trip that<br>certain teachers go on who are like<br>there because they are bigger than kids<br>um and it is difficult in that<br>environment for kids to learn which is<br>very important for them to learn that<br>they are also people who are able<br>allowed and welcome to communicate and<br>advocate for their needs I wish that<br>teachers and staff in education were<br>more willing<br>to put<br>communication<br>as like their primary intention and<br>interactions with young people<br>um I think that coming from a place of<br>like curiosity and wanting to understand<br>where that young person is at and what<br>they are needing and what they're trying<br>to tell you could do a lot of good for<br>the well-being of the whole<br>classroom it's a really nice way of<br>saying it yeah I agree cuz the best<br>classes and the best the times I've done<br>the best in school has been when<br>I've had a rapport with the teacher like<br>uh the one that I've done my University<br>with for the past three years uh we've<br>reached a point where we just sass each<br>other and it's really great it's like I<br>show up to my uh uh weekly meetings and<br>it's basically just an excuse to uh<br>banter with each other back and forth<br>and that was in high school as well it<br>was uh with my English teacher and my<br>geography teacher especially I remember<br>one time I was handing in a geography<br>paper and I think it was meant to be<br>like a five-page essay Max it was 15<br>pages and that was me severely cutting<br>it down and he went AJ I have to read<br>this and I said I had to write it and he<br>he said okay that's<br>fair and yeah those like those were<br>always the classes I did best in because<br>they were just the uh sass the teacher I<br>guess and they always worked well but on<br>the opposite end when you can't do that<br>it uh doesn't end well yeah cuz there's<br>some teachers that just Power Trip like<br>you said<br>and that's not doing anyone any favors I<br>think um that's probably where we are at<br>with as a family at the moment is what<br>we're hoping for our little people in<br>the education system is to have good<br>relationships with their teachers in<br>good Mutual relationships where they can<br>appreciate different communication<br>Styles and I think if my child goes into<br>a system and they feel liked and<br>supported I actually don't really care<br>what they learn cuz they already<br>learning that they can be in community<br>and that they're a worthy wonderful<br>person and that's really the only thing<br>I worry about as a parent not to be a<br>terrible influence but as soon as I<br>finished high school my immediately<br>immediate wish was that I didn't try so<br>hard in high school because I went into<br>design school and I didn't even I hadn't<br>even finished high school at that point<br>I basically came and I showed them a<br>demo of my uh portfolio and I was like<br>yeah do you have any advice on like how<br>to improve it they're like you're in<br>excuse me you're in congratul welcome to<br>the school so yeah my immediate thought<br>in high school was well that was a waste<br>of time I wish I didn't stressed about<br>out about that so<br>much that's a really good point I think<br>knowing your options is a huge thing and<br>being able to make those choices that<br>are positive at at the time that you<br>need them yeah as someone who didn't<br>stress about high school and went<br>through all of it with the thought in 10<br>years when people look at my resume they<br>won't think about about how I did an NCA<br>literally at all um and so what is the<br>point um I agree doesn't matter I didn't<br>do any of it I do not have any NCA<br>levels but I do have a career that I<br>love and a volunteer job that I love and<br>friends and family that I love and the<br>life that I love and that's much more<br>important and that's really interesting<br>cuz I'm the I'm the same but opposite I<br>have Excellence endorsements in all my<br>ncas and it doesn't matter I have a life<br>I love I have friends I love family<br>we're getting there but I really enjoy<br>being a person that I am now and I agree<br>High School didn't matter no one's life<br>is over at 18 no exactly<br>exactly that's such wise words um for a<br>parent because it's scary it's really<br>scary when your child is afraid MH to go<br>to school and I think you think they're<br>missing out on those things you know<br>those High<br>sorry College things two American still<br>and um it is and I think hearing that as<br>a parent is incredibly valuable and very<br>insightful it's like oh yeah this isn't<br>the end game you yeah this is just a<br>step I feel like it's so easy to feel<br>that and just high school was a<br>nightmare for my mental health cuz uh<br>kind of not on the top of autism here<br>but every project was focused around how<br>[ __ ] up the world is and how<br>everything is going wrong there was<br>never any solutions in those classes it<br>was always everything is bad good<br>luck I think one class we had like I<br>think this is actually the class that<br>got me into industrial design it was<br>yeah this guy out of college he made<br>this special trash collector that skins<br>the top of the ocean and picks it all up<br>and it's a really cool recycling I'm<br>like wow amazing finally we have a<br>positive interaction we have someone who<br>is doing something and my teacher went<br>up and said yes so this isn't really<br>working it doesn't clean up all the<br>microplastics it doesn't matter it's not<br>trying to clean up the microplastics<br>it's trying to clean up all the other<br>trash someone else can invent something<br>to clean the microplastics that is what<br>I<br>said we're not going to fix everything<br>by finding one person who is smart<br>enough to solve all of it with a single<br>idea the way<br>that the reason that people are alive as<br>a species is because of our communities<br>and because of the connections that we<br>have to each other it is our greatest<br>strength um<br>when newborn Es are born the first thing<br>that they can do is run because what<br>keeps them alive is that they can run<br>and when babies are born the first thing<br>that they do is cry because what keeps<br>Us Alive is that we communicate with<br>each other about our needs um when I<br>feel at work like the things I am doing<br>can't fix everything I look around at<br>the people I am working with and I<br>remember that I do not have to because<br>if I cannot do something there are other<br>people who will fill in the gaps and<br>that is what it means to have a<br>community<br>or something that is a really I've I<br>love that metaphor I guess or comparison<br>of horses to babies that's really cool<br>that's a weird sentence to say without<br>context but I think that is what in the<br>ideal World classrooms could offer my<br>kids this feeling that they don't have<br>to be everything and do everything but<br>they can be a valid part of the<br>community yeah a very Val part in that<br>yeah can you describe a positive<br>experience with teachers or School staff<br>I had lots of favorite teachers at Bor<br>KY it was Maran she was good in Catching<br>me at St Francis the sales they were two<br>special teachers they were Mandy and<br>aeda who was my teach Ro for most of my<br>time at St Francis when I I went to Hors<br>everyone was so kind and nice so they<br>were all<br>my favorites in wington high I enjoyed<br>being taught by Hannah and Vicky at<br>walck my teachers were Marie and Scott<br>and they were good<br>fun cool that was that's really positive<br>so glad there were so many yeah I think<br>in every in every place that he went and<br>the teacher aids being a real key role<br>for him as well I have a couple of<br>really POS positive experiences I'm<br>bursting to talk about because they've<br>had such a profound impact I think on my<br>child but actually more importantly on<br>our whole family um and the first one<br>was our first visit to kindy um so I was<br>taking along my 3 and 1 half year-old<br>and with my baby on my hip and I was<br>more tired than tired and so frightened<br>I've never been so frightened um I<br>didn't know what to expect I was very<br>aware that my child was developing in an<br>unpredictable asynchronous way and I<br>didn't know how that would be received<br>at kindy and I also knew that he had a<br>lot of sensory things going on he was<br>likely to find kindy loud which he did<br>busy what she did the kids would be<br>overwhelming they were so I was going<br>along anyway somehow I'd mastered up all<br>this courage and I was very prepared to<br>be turned away that was what was going<br>on in my head and um as a little three<br>in kindy initially it went worse than I<br>even had nightmares about um yes my<br>child was overwhelmed they got a fright<br>when someone ran around the corner and<br>they pushed them over which created a<br>whole big thing but the kindy just<br>showed how<br>beautifully understanding and skilled<br>they were um so I just saw this these<br>teachers emerge like the well<br>orchestrated SWAT team and one went to<br>help support the child who was<br>unfortunately pushed and one was<br>supporting us cuz all three of us at<br>that point had started to cry um and I<br>remember saying like I don't know if um<br>my child can participate at KY and the<br>head teacher Nikki and I think everybody<br>deserves a Nikki she said oh this is a<br>bread and butter this is we've got this<br>this is Early Childhood this is<br>predictable this is expected and then<br>she went on and actually really got to<br>know my boy really well and then she was<br>coming at me with a different narrative<br>which was your boy is such an exciting<br>learner I saw him do this and she just<br>had such a clear belief that my boy<br>deserved to be at KY and that our family<br>deserved to be there and that um he<br>could participate in his way which is by<br>the way supported in the ti curriculum<br>like there is provision there that your<br>child should be to participate and play<br>like they like to play but that whole<br>kindy really wrapped around and they<br>created that for my boy and they also<br>gave him opportunities that we just<br>couldn't as a family so yes he had his<br>interests and they had all the materials<br>to build and expand on these and they'd<br>slowly draw in another child into the<br>play too so we could learn to kind of<br>tolerate that and it really build just<br>this confidence and um capacity in him<br>but more importantly I guess beliefs in<br>our family that actually our kid could<br>do this they could participate they<br>could be part of it um and then all the<br>learning stories coming through were all<br>about his contributions to the kindi<br>like he's thinking of new like you were<br>saying new ways to play new things to<br>bring in and it was being so valued and<br>I think that actually set us up as a<br>family to believe that actually our<br>child who is a really capable learner um<br>participate a really capable member of<br>his community yeah so that um I will<br>always remember that I will always be<br>appreciative to Nikki I don't think I<br>think when you are that skilled teacher<br>you may not<br>appreciate how critical Your Role is and<br>how much of a fundamental change that<br>you can have to a little person but<br>their whole family around them as well<br>so that's my favorite positive<br>experience we've had other positive<br>experiences TOA that was just such a<br>lightning B for my family that's so<br>beautiful I'm so happy amazing yeah and<br>I um when things don't go very well and<br>they don't often um that's one of the<br>memories I really draw on to think no I<br>have a child who's an exciting learner<br>and who can participate when when he's<br>got a team around him who believes in<br>him and likes him and and makes an<br>effort to connect<br>and understand him then he's capable of<br>anything yeah but it does it does take<br>the whole system to believe and get<br>behind a little person I think I mean<br>that's all any parent wants isn't it is<br>for other adults to like take their kid<br>in good faith and<br>think this little person's really cool<br>what are they trying to say yes yeah<br>yeah that's exactly what I want um<br>there's black birds<br>outside um let them stay<br>outside um female black birds are brown<br>and they have spots on their chests<br>which makes them look very similar to<br>song threshes but song threshes look<br>different cuz the spots on their chests<br>have like a gold ring around them like<br>cheetah spots and that's how you can<br>tell the difference because they're much<br>more<br>contrasted<br>Co I only know how to identify like<br>knowledge I think that your example I<br>mean when I think about the examples<br>that I have or I thought of yours<br>captured the the main essence of what<br>those are and that is um just empathy<br>understanding acknowledging yeah and<br>then community and acceptance yeah but<br>not even just acceptance but that that<br>acknowledgement like your contribution<br>yeah and then that also the effect that<br>it has on the entire family and I think<br>it was just a perfect example cuz for me<br>those are real three components to what<br>my stories were as<br>well um and it was yeah it<br>was great to hear yeah that was the game<br>changer for us um yeah so I was to my<br>memory quite close with all of the<br>teachers that I had in Primary School um<br>I was always like the kid who felt like<br>they were besties with their teacher um<br>and that was really wonderful for me and<br>worked great for me um it was a bit<br>trickier in high school CU you just have<br>suddenly a lot more teachers and you<br>can't be besties with all of them um law<br>of large numbers not in the cards that's<br>okay um but my textiles teacher who I<br>had for all of high school was really<br>really wonderful and supported me so<br>much um she was always really<br>like excited about my ideas and cared<br>about the things that I wanted to make<br>um and helped reain me in when my ideas<br>were actually way too complicated and<br>unfeasible to pull off in the time frame<br>that we had in our classroom um I<br>appreciated that<br>um<br>when um she also like was always like on<br>board with me going way off script of<br>her assignments um and doing things I<br>wasn't really supposed to do um as long<br>as I made something cool and did it and<br>it was great gradable she was like I<br>would love to grade whatever you would<br>like to make um when I was away at he<br>school for long periods um she would in<br>her class time uh work on my projects<br>that I was doing so that whenever I was<br>back in the classroom I was always CAU<br>up with my peers and I could still like<br>be doing what everybody else was doing<br>and that meant so much to me um and at<br>the end of high school when I was like<br>17 um and I had come back and I wasn't<br>really going to almost any of my classes<br>right before I dropped out for the last<br>time uh the one that I always always<br>always went to was my textiles class um<br>I loved it very much I felt really<br>supported by her yes cool teacher yeah<br>she was<br>cool a lot of my good teachers came in<br>University and I will say Tanya's name<br>because Tanya's amazing and she's<br>awesome but I'm going to tell you a bad<br>story about Tanya<br>instead uh so we Tanya does is my<br>concept teacher she does prop making she<br>makes toys she is single-handedly<br>responsible for getting me into that so<br>I have only good things except for this<br>one thing to say about Tanya so we were<br>making prop props for one class and I<br>really wanted to have the spinning light<br>thing and Tanya kept saying to me over<br>and over I can't count how many times<br>she said why does it need to spin and<br>apparently that meant AJ you should not<br>make the spin it is far too complicated<br>and you're slowing yourself down I just<br>heard why do you need to make it spin<br>cuz spinning is cool<br>Tanya and I did not understand it that's<br>what she was trying to say until the<br>final week and I went I would also<br>interpret that as I've got to come up<br>with a really cool written justification<br>for why I want this thing to sprin to<br>put in my project brief exactly that is<br>exactly how I took it and it wasn't<br>until the final week when we were like<br>finishing everything up and I uh turns<br>out I couldn't make it spin I went<br>oh and I I think that Epiphany came<br>during class and everyone was like cuz<br>they don't heard this feedback as well<br>they're like yeah RJ no<br>kidding why did nobody tell me yeah you<br>didn't tell me my idea was bad you asked<br>me to justify it I love to justify my<br>ideas justify it but I think she admired<br>the uh tenacity to it but I'll tell you<br>a positive story about Tanya when I was<br>at this last semester of unity when I<br>couldn't show up to anything I had to<br>tell my three main lecturers hey uh I<br>can't come to class anymore and all of<br>them responded especially Tanya was like<br>that is okay you do you uh we fully<br>support you we will work with you and uh<br>we trust that you can do this and yeah<br>they were they put me first and foremost<br>and that was just I didn't expect it<br>like even though I know like I've been<br>working with them for years I know<br>they're lovely people I still didn't<br>expect them to care about me as sad as<br>that seems to sound but they were yeah<br>that was just really lovely and having<br>that support of a teacher acknowledging<br>don't worry this isn't a failure on your<br>part and we can still work with it and<br>you can still work despite or around you<br>can yeah just that faith in me was<br>really really nice and positive yeah and<br>there I do want to make a point to<br>anyone watching that it is really scary<br>to say hey I need this or hey I can't do<br>this but a lot of the time if you get up<br>that bravery people are really cool<br>about it and you don't understand how<br>happens yes that they are the most<br>valuable thing from my perspective um<br>and that they're worth asking for yeah<br>and that schools are incredibly um busy<br>pressured places and sometimes you might<br>need to ask a few times um if the first<br>answer when we're a bit busy at the<br>moment I think they're important if your<br>child is struggling and they're<br>important if your child's not at the<br>because sometimes people say oh they're<br>doing pretty well at the moment they may<br>not be needed I would um strongly<br>suggest they might still be helpful the<br>reason I think that is that you get a<br>moment where one-on-one with your<br>child's teacher and with the Seno or<br>anybody us and the team supporting your<br>child and that you can go through and<br>share your understanding and really<br>partner<br>um in supporting that child yeah and um<br>often you can solve 30 problems quickly<br>with a lot of people around the table<br>rather than 20,000 emails yeah so I<br>think they're really<br>helpful yeah so I don't know what IEP is<br>it's an individual education plan and<br>it's a plan that gets made between the<br>staff of the school and their families<br>about what is the best way to support<br>that learner and what things they need<br>to be able to learn as well as they can<br>and it is one that the school is<br>beholden to they have to follow it um<br>and it is subject to change over time is<br>that is there more that's a beautiful<br>summary okay well I've never had one so<br>I think I did pretty<br>decently um I think in practice it often<br>looks like people mating around a table<br>and talking through like um student<br>teacher interviews but larger scale<br>better because teacher interviews are<br>short and sharp this would be like an<br>hour and an hour and a half you might<br>have um the family you can bring support<br>people too which is really important um<br>I've got my child is really teaching me<br>to be a lot braver in how I communicate<br>and Advocate because historically that<br>has been a weakness of mine and it's<br>having to become a strength um but I<br>sometimes feel a lot of pressure going<br>to those meetings to have all the<br>answers will be perfect but then I think<br>no actually my role is to be there as<br>family and um I always say things like I<br>can be quite slow processing and I might<br>come up with an answer that I'll email<br>later rather than the pressure to have<br>to solve all of the um challenges it's<br>like what I said before about how you<br>don't have to be the person to solve<br>anything because you are not alone and<br>there are people to fill in the gaps it<br>feels like that when you have an IEP<br>that's supportive and you've got a lot<br>of people around the table yeah um the<br>kindy that I was raving about in their<br>IEP I don't know how they got it to<br>happen but we had the family we had the<br>head teacher we had every single other<br>teacher who had showed up for my boy in<br>their own time we asked a lot of our<br>teachers actually to do the sort of<br>things in our own time I'd like to see a<br>world where teachers were supported with<br>more released time to um be able to<br>attend these meetings but that actually<br>blew me away every single person showed<br>up I have to say that too pep and and<br>one that I went to and it was at college<br>and I don't the only thing that I<br>remember from<br>is that there was about nine teachers in<br>the room and I thought I am I have never<br>seen this and it absolutely took me I<br>was I was in awe I was like I'm so glad<br>my son is here and the goals were great<br>and I looked at them afterward but that<br>was the the thing that I was really<br>impressed by that they took that time um<br>something that I really appreciated<br>about the speech language therapist that<br>they had at my high school was that um<br>she was the first person I think I met<br>who really cared about like my goals and<br>what was important to me um I found that<br>in school previously it seemed as though<br>goals were something that other people<br>make for you based on what they think<br>you should be and you just kind of sit<br>there and wait for them to make them and<br>then don't do them one of the biggest<br>ones that we had was um cuz I went to<br>meet her and I went into a room with her<br>and I closed the blinds and turned all<br>the lights off um and she was like it's<br>so cool to meet you and I nodded and she<br>like handed me I think like paper or her<br>phone or something for me to start<br>writing notes to her and we started<br>talking about all of my interests and we<br>got along so well and it was wonderful<br>um and it was like I think the first<br>person who didn't see me not speaking as<br>like a hindrance to us getting along or<br>getting to know each other she was just<br>like this is a neutral fact about you I<br>am going to be your friend anyway um<br>what she used to say a lot was um you<br>are a young person and that means that<br>sometimes people won't listen to or<br>respect you when you say your needs but<br>you know what you're needs are I don't<br>know them my job is that I am an adult<br>and I'm going to stand behind you look<br>very tall and official so when you<br>communicate your needs to people they<br>think oh a grownup better listen to that<br>um so all you have to do is help me to<br>do that for you um and that was our main<br>goal that we had together was um to<br>figure out what the best way is to<br>communicate my needs to my teachers and<br>that was something that was really<br>important and meaningful to me and I<br>really appreciated<br>that it's awesome I'm borrowing that<br>yeah it's a good one is it yeah cuz that<br>sounds like something that was missing<br>for my education cuz I didn't have a<br>diagnosis for all of it so I was just<br>struggling to do anything do everything<br>uh myself and I never had that sort of I<br>had to advocate for myself if I was<br>struggling I never had somebody to be<br>like oh you are struggling here let me<br>help you with that it was<br>always either silently just keep pushing<br>and keep pushing yourself harder cuz if<br>you don't it's a failure on you or when<br>University when I finally got some<br>confidence I was okay I have to start<br>admitting I can't do things and it<br>worked it was a good positive experience<br>but it's a difficult thing to have to go<br>yourself I think that each autistic<br>person is different and that people<br>supporting them should find out their<br>lives and dislikes so they they can<br>support them<br>better give them more money please just<br>pay them better they'll care<br>more I think more support to understand<br>autism and neurod Divergence and general<br>um and more support to understand the<br>individual autistic student in front of<br>you I think um fair enough actually it<br>is quite difficult sometimes to<br>understand a person who is developing in<br>a different exciting way to what would<br>be considered standard and I think<br>that's challenging because sometimes you<br>have a lot of asynchronous a they're<br>asynchronous so they've got a lot of<br>really Peak skills and sometimes you<br>look at those skills and you think right<br>you should be able to do everything at<br>this level and then it suddenly becomes<br>very frustrating the teacher and the<br>student when they're not or you look at<br>their absolute base skills and I guess<br>that might have been what was you're<br>saying is happening to you at school<br>this is the the lowest skill set we're<br>seeing we're assuming everything is at<br>that level and then suddenly School<br>becomes very boring and unexciting and<br>you're missing all the gold as well but<br>that's quite a hard process to do so I<br>think more support for schools and<br>understanding each individual child<br>would be brilli I want teachers to have<br>the time and money and resources and<br>bandwidth and support to be able to do<br>that for all of their students yeah um I<br>think that um embracing variations in<br>the way that students learn is something<br>that can only help everyone I would<br>really like for students to be uplifted<br>and supported in their learning um I<br>think that teachers are never going to<br>be able to spot every neurod Divergent<br>kid in their classroom and they should<br>shouldn't have to and those kids<br>shouldn't fall through the gaps when<br>that happens and also like kids who<br>don't get to hide their neurod<br>Divergence like I could in Primary<br>School shouldn't be falling through<br>those gaps either<br>um like I don't know for example<br>information doesn't need to be conveyed<br>in really vague ways with a lot of words<br>and if it isn't that's not going to hurt<br>the kids who can understand things that<br>are conveyed vaguely and with lots of<br>words it's just going to help everybody<br>to be on the same page when I did my<br>work for the roal commission something<br>that I said a lot was that uh most<br>people who are working taking care of um<br>autistic people are not waking up with<br>the intention to cause harm but harm is<br>still happening um and it isn't because<br>they're evil it's because they are tired<br>and they don't have it in them to be<br>there for everyone and I think the world<br>could be a whole lot better if we made<br>it so that they had it in them to be<br>there for<br>everyone<br>yeah uh do you want to add something or<br>I'll add something no it's all your J uh<br>a specific piece of advice I would say<br>is keep on top of and learn about<br>symptoms of autism uh signs of autism as<br>it keeps new research keeps coming in<br>just keep on top of that because I feel<br>like the reason nobody caught it when I<br>was little or teenager or at any point<br>was cuz I didn't fit into those boxes<br>of old research and that's something<br>even now that my parents look back and<br>say like ah but you didn't show any of<br>the signs I did they're just not the<br>signs that you knew and that comes from<br>uh a family that has a history of<br>nursing as well so they had more and<br>that's yes they had more research and<br>knowledge than most but it still was<br>wrong wasn't<br>enough I get that I personally don't<br>mind whether teachers can tell if their<br>students are ner divver as long as<br>they uh can do their best to uh figure<br>out how they learn and how they can<br>support them in that for<br>everybody<br>um but I understand how it could also be<br>helpful to know yeah I only say it<br>because when I started looking for a<br>diagnosis uh everyone's reaction was oh<br>your teachers never picked it up so it<br>was like the beend or like that is part<br>of their job like I actually think<br>that's what my mom said to me at one it<br>is part of their job to know if you're<br>autistic to see those signs right that's<br>what I said like I'm like I said that<br>doesn't sound right that doesn't sound<br>like something they should be weren't<br>able to do or should have to do yeah too<br>much that's not fair okay that's the<br>last one can I say one last thing that I<br>would just love absolutely I would love<br>for you to do that um well for everybody<br>for the for our whole Community is I<br>guess a broader mind and openness to<br>different communication Styles and maybe<br>letting go of some of the assumptions<br>that neurotypical communic communication<br>styles are the best most respectful<br>appropriate way of communicating I know<br>there are some things that I think my<br>son will never be able to do comfortably<br>I don't think he's ever going to want to<br>choose to make eye contact comfortably<br>as a way to communicate I think um if<br>you tone police them the whole time uh<br>it's going to be unsuccessful also a<br>distraction you're not paying attention<br>to what he's communicating to you if<br>you're so busy thinking about all the<br>ways that he's doing it wrong thank you<br>um I would really love yeah you're right<br>for people to be like excited and<br>curious about how to best communicate<br>with every person that they meet yeah<br>yeah I guess I would walk into a<br>classroom and if I see a poster that<br>says this is how a respectful listener<br>is and it's like still bodies I contact<br>hands and lap and I look and I think oh<br>my child is never going to be able to<br>show you respect in the way that you're<br>wanting yeah but they will be the child<br>in the back of the classroom listening<br>to every word you say yeah that would be<br>what I would like is maybe a bit more<br>education around different communication<br>Styles and appreciation for them as well<br>my last suggestion is just to get rid of<br>all those posters oh yeah then the<br>posters and get rid of punishments for<br>rules<br>everyone's looking at me I can start um<br>I've got my notes<br>again excuse my phone on the table of<br>everyone<br>um I think that the problem with autism<br>inclusion in the classroom is that<br>education is a lot like a coat that is<br>too small um and accommodations are like<br>they are trying to stretch it to fit<br>around the students that it doesn't work<br>for but it doesn't sit right and it<br>pulls in all the wrong places and people<br>are always asking things like how do we<br>change this what spot do we need to pull<br>on to make sure that it fits around you<br>like what do you need to suck in where<br>do you need to put your shoulders what<br>should we be tugging at um and what we<br>really need is just a bigger<br>coat um I don't want to be stretched<br>around I don't want to feel seams<br>popping at my shoulders and to be<br>sucking in when people pull up a zip I<br>don't want to feel fabric pressed tight<br>that the Cuffs um I want a bigger<br>coat I think that education would be<br>better if we just had a bigger coat I<br>think that should be written down<br>somewhere beautiful beautiful it is<br>written in your okay I think that should<br>be shared more broadly that's poster up<br>yeah that's right um I think that the<br>question is really simple and complex at<br>the same time I actually think a lot of<br>the answer would be things that would<br>improve the system for all students I<br>think all students would benefit from<br>smaller classrooms ab and being able to<br>self-regulate by moving in and out of<br>environments that work for them I think<br>that's going to take a real shift in<br>mindset about how we value education and<br>the resources we put into it yeah I<br>think lots of the like um improvements<br>that can be made to education for<br>autistic students I can't really think<br>of any that wouldn't have a real curb<br>cut effect for every student in the<br>classroom um I think that it is not just<br>autistic and neur diversion kids who<br>would benefit from the education system<br>being a bigger coat I would like it to<br>fit around everybody without any tugging<br>I think if you flipped the script too<br>and you you could have a lot of time<br>thinking about all the amazing things<br>that the autistic children bring to the<br>classroom I mean if we're wanting our<br>kids to learn about creativity Thinking<br>Out of the Box Um passion for projects<br>and what you believe in and following<br>your gut and your instinct think that we<br>want to be looking to our autistic kids<br>if you want kids to get stronger at<br>perspective taking and understanding<br>different frames of reference that you<br>want autistic kids in your classroom um<br>I would like my class my children to be<br>in classroom with a lot of diversity to<br>stretch and grow them because I think<br>that's what we're going to need our<br>adults to be in the future as well I<br>don't disagree with that sentiment but I<br>do think it's important to include the<br>fact that an autistic child does not<br>have to have a purpose they do not yeah<br>I know that's not what you're saying but<br>I'll say it for the purpose of video and<br>uh saying it out loud that you don't<br>have to be useful you don't have to<br>Justify Your Existence as an autistic<br>person you exist and that's fine<br>yeah yeah I agree don't have to be<br>useful yeah I'd really like for those<br>like as you were saying like those core<br>learning skills to be prioritized over<br>the like little projects that try to<br>communicate them cuz some of them might<br>not be the way that that core learning<br>still gets across to that student and<br>I'd love if we could figure out like how<br>we can teach everyone those skills of<br>like critical thinking and following<br>your interests and self motivation and<br>learning and research and connecting<br>with other people and communicating your<br>ideas I'd love if that was on top<br>yeah uh I think this comes from my<br>speech therapy point of view but uh I<br>think that um developing friendship<br>and the importance of the the role that<br>the teacher plays in showing people how<br>to communicate in different way so that<br>you can<br>access the amazing skills and the<br>amazing attributes and humor and<br>intelligence and all these things that<br>sometimes people aren't sure how to<br>communicate with people to access those<br>things because the communication is<br>different yet when you get past that uh<br>not I shouldn't say past it but when you<br>understand and have another Pathway to<br>go it's a Gold Line and I just think<br>that should be encouraged for all<br>children so that they can experience the<br>other parts of school like the<br>friendships that they may just not know<br>how they need a bit of support to get<br>there and then everyone wins so I think<br>the friendships is something that um is<br>invaluable and the stories that I hear<br>is that's what people remember yeah<br>teachers can be help us by understanding<br>the<br>disability each of us has individual<br>needs we just need to be understood for<br>me structure is very important and most<br>of us work in our own special once<br>teachers gain our trust and we let them<br>in and understanding teis is the best<br>personally absolutely once you have that<br>trust in that relationship then<br>everything goes better and that's what<br>you've all said isn't it yeah I feel<br>like I've touched on already but having<br>the ability to create your education to<br>suit you is really the most valuable<br>thing and it's an really hard thing to<br>set up as a system to say oh some of you<br>have to follow these stringent rules and<br>others you can make a path for yourself<br>and it's really looking at an entire<br>upheaval but there are middle grounds I<br>worked in University well with everybody<br>else following the same strict<br>guidelines strict guidelines for a<br>design major uh but I was working with<br>my own way and that worked really well<br>for me so it's there's ways to work it<br>in there but I do think that it's<br>important to look at the education<br>system itself isn't quite working for<br>this specific needs and it's either<br>looking at how can we fix that from the<br>ground up or how can we alter it as it<br>is now to work and I don't I'm I don't<br>have the answers to that question I<br>don't work in the education system but<br>that's okay bringing up the question is<br>is one of the main things and then we<br>have other people to do that right Ry<br>well I used to work in the education<br>system and I can say none of us have the<br>answers either but that's why we fill in<br>each other's gaps and that's why we work<br>change oh beautiful look at me<br>go what was your favorite subject in<br>school<br>um history history what do you like<br>about history um I really love memories<br>and I really love<br>dates and<br>birthday are you are
