Her wide-ranging research includes copyright and other intellectual property laws, consumer law, decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), cryptocurrencies, NFTs and blockchain more generally. She has held a numerous leadership and governance roles throughout the University. Alex has also served on governance bodies for many organisations outside the University including ConsumerNZ, Telecommunications Dispute Resolution, BlockchainNZ, Legal Research Foundation and the Australasian Law Teachers Association.<br><br>In her inaugural lecture, Alex draws on her research and teaching at the University to discuss law and other paradoxes. Her presentation explains that contrary to the common portrayal of law as clear and straightforward, how the law applies in any given situation depends on the facts and a range of other factors. This presentation also covers other paradoxes including why people are prepared to pay significant sums of money for digital files, which anyone can copy with a right mouse click.<br><br>Follow us on

you that don't know me my name<br>is Andrew Patterson I'm one of two<br>Deputy DS of the faculty of business and<br>economics uh inaugural professorial<br>lectures have a longstanding tradition<br>in Academia and indeed it marks a<br>significant milestone in an academic<br>career it's a WR of Passage that we take<br>very seriously and we honor at our<br>University now let me allow you to uh<br>let now allow me to introduce you to<br>Professor Sims Alex started as a<br>lecturer in the department of commercial<br>law in the year 2000 after completing<br>her master of commercial law in the<br>department her research has three areas<br>they are intellectual property uh<br>particularly copyright law consumer law<br>and various aspects of blockchain<br>recently Alex has brought two of these<br>areas together together in her work on<br>the right to repair they are<br>intellectual property and commercial law<br>she believes in the need for research to<br>be understood by the public and policy<br>makers and also for academics to provide<br>comments on news events to achieve these<br>aims Alex regularly writes opinion<br>pieces and appears in the media<br>including as a tech commentator on Radio<br>New Zealand in case you're wondering uh<br>her next appearance will be at 11:00<br>a.m. on this<br>Thursday Alex is teaching like her<br>research is also very broad she teaches<br>on a range of topics and in different<br>programs from stage one all the way<br>through to postgraduate and this year<br>alone you might be interested that she<br>is teaching on the the bom core and<br>business 1112 which is a<br>multi-disciplinary course an elective<br>course on intellectual property and<br>innovation in the commercial law<br>undergraduate major part of a<br>post-graduate course in the Masters of<br>bioscience Enterprise and a course on<br>Technologies and compliance in the<br>master of information governance program<br>I admit to being biased positively in<br>favor of the master of information<br>governance program I teaching it myself<br>but I know that Alex has a wonderful job<br>in that program uh there's not enough<br>time really for me to go through all of<br>the achievements and contributions that<br>Alex has made to the faculty and the<br>university but some highlights do<br>include being part of the team that<br>created the business school woman's uh<br>program which began in 2011 and is still<br>going strong driving the creation of the<br>Department of commercial laws visiting<br>scholar program and its annual student<br>prize giving uh more recently Alex has<br>demonstrated her proactive nature<br>and insisting that there was an urgent<br>need early in 2022 for wide faculty<br>engagement and discussions around the<br>impacts of generative Ai and chat gbt in<br>particular we certainly remember that<br>time period don't we um she foresaw the<br>impact of geni would have on assessments<br>including tests exams and other<br>assignments Alex co-organized AER on<br>assessments and generative Ai and made<br>many presentations both within the<br>faculty and outside of the subjects in<br>the spirit of collaboration she freely<br>shared her adapted assessments so chck<br>GPT proof assessments for others across<br>the university for others to to learn<br>from which is very very important at<br>that time given that she's an expert um<br>in in the area and of course true to<br>form she engaged in writing some opinion<br>pieces for the media um on generative Ai<br>and assessments and the future of work I<br>just wanted to say that as we listen to<br>this lecture this evening let us not<br>only absorb the knowledge being shared<br>but also appreciate the Journey of<br>perseverance dedication and passion that<br>has led to this moment Alex let us be<br>inspired to pursue our own Paths of<br>inquiry with the same fervor and<br>commitment and with that I hand you over<br>um welcome everyone uh for coming here<br>and it's great to see so many people<br>from all sorts of different walks of<br>life um many over the years that I've<br>interacted with um subtitle an<br>unorthodox and accidental academic um<br>unorthodox because more than one person<br>has said that about me and probably<br>other terms as well um and the<br>congratulations messages have been um<br>really interesting um a lot of welld<br>deserved um about time um but to stand<br>out in particular um no I know I should<br>have asked the people who sent me the<br>messages beforehand but as we'll see<br>it's always better to seek forgiveness<br>and ask for permission um and I just say<br>that both our academics at this<br>University and uh they were in different<br>faculties and not in this faculty so the<br>first message was um but as we know it<br>often takes this institution a long time<br>to do the right thing um but this was my<br>first time applying for promotion so<br>it's my fault not applying earlier and<br>the second message was um well-deserved<br>Alex uh being a prophit Visionary is<br>never easy keep challenging the status<br>quo your inspiration to many um so I<br>think some people will know that um<br>challenging the status quo is accurate<br>um um but I don't go far enough for some<br>people so someone else simply messaged<br>last week actually said congratulated me<br>and then said um I hope they' be able to<br>be a bit more outspoken about a certain<br>issue in my new position I'm<br>thinking I can't run um but I'm not a<br>prophet or a Visionary um but what I am<br>is a systems thinker and so systems<br>thinking is of a definition up here um<br>and so you know for me systems thinking<br>means seeing how the world is working<br>and then trying to put it into context<br>in the current current system uh make<br>change that way now I wish I could just<br>walk past things and ignore them but I<br>can't I'm always thinking that could be<br>changed for the better but what I have<br>learned is not to tell people that they<br>don't like it they really don't like it<br>so I just just shut up and and be quied<br>um I also listen to lots and lots and<br>read very very widely from all sides of<br>the political debate from history to all<br>sorts of things um when things are being<br>sensed of course um and so part of the<br>issue is now is that there's no source<br>that you can rely on that's always<br>accurate so even the So-Cal mainstream<br>media get things wrong quite often so<br>what we need is critical thinking um<br>which I try to get students to engage in<br>um not Le successfully so um to only an<br>orthodox title this may be a bit<br>unorthodox this talk um and also because<br>part of my sort of thing with teaching<br>is make get people to think that's what<br>I'll be doing here<br>now um Banky so I just show one video<br>and this this um is a video I show to<br>students quite often and I showed at the<br>beginning just to show people that um<br>that law depends I mean law does p in<br>fact they get hold off the same pins and<br>sometimes there are some clear rules but<br>even when there are some clear rules you<br>may not want to follow them so if this<br>works<br>okay um I did sort this out before so<br>two minute clip so this involves Banky<br>so if you don't know Banky is a very<br>famous sud dominous artist in the US in<br>the<br>UK should work<br>not a typical lunchtime at Bridge Farm<br>primary a 14 ft baie original in the<br>playground he snuck in over half turn it<br>was 7-year-old Charlie who wrote to<br>Banky to tell him pupils had named a<br>house after the Bristol born artist what<br>did you think when you came into school<br>this morning and saw that on the wall<br>really amazed amazed yes 100 million per<br>yes sure what's your message to Banky<br>for doing this for the school<br>thank you so much for this really good<br>picture the caretaker found this letter<br>stuck to a gutter pipe when he turned up<br>this morning inside a handwritten letter<br>from Banksy in which he says thanks for<br>naming a house after me if you don't<br>like the artwork I've done feel free to<br>add stuff I'm sure the teachers won't<br>mind he says then at the end the message<br>remember it's always easier to get<br>forgiveness than permission much love<br>thanks teachers would normally be<br>warning children against trespass and<br>vandalism but they say this artwork is<br>inspirational and Banky was kind of<br>invited of course it's also worth a lot<br>of money but the school doesn't intend<br>to sell a child with a burning tire it's<br>not necessarily what you'd expect to see<br>on a playground War I think you have to<br>interpret art how you interpret art so<br>um the symbolism in it I guess is for um<br>other people to to work out we just like<br>the fact that we have a fanky in the<br>school the man who found it was are the<br>less impressed when he opened up this<br>morning I mean normally you'd be<br>clearing off graffiti wouldn't you yes I<br>was very I was a bit annoyed when I<br>seeing that on my wall think that's<br>going to have to come off but then it's<br>was like okay there's a bank SE in the<br>corner right let's get on the phone then<br>to the<br>Head now the school intends to cover<br>Ba's present with protective plastic to<br>stop it being ruined by other graffiti<br>artists oh the irony John K BBC News<br>Bristol okay some thinking okay um I<br>won't go through the actual law here I<br>um very quickly there the law if the<br>property owner consents in New Zealand<br>then it's not there's been no um<br>criminal um action there um so it looks<br>to me like there's retrospective<br>consent um now it's a very good thing<br>the caretaker didn't follow as normal<br>rules of wiping that off um and removing<br>the bank SE and there's nothing worse<br>than people that follow the rules 100%<br>of the time okay there's always<br>exceptions as this one shows um now most<br>of us knows know within this University<br>or other organizations There are rules<br>that must be followed and rules that you<br>don't really need to follow um it took<br>me it took me a few years to work there<br>what rules so now I<br>know so in the beginning okay um that's<br>a bit of a custom for people a bit of<br>their sort of childhood and stuff which<br>I'm going to do take the luxury of doing<br>it now I was born in Kent I wasn't born<br>there but Kent is famous for its Hots um<br>and I'm the eldest of three um and I<br>think there was something to birth<br>orders um and my father was English and<br>fortunately he can't be here because he<br>died a few years ago and my mother who<br>was here tonight um is a New Zealander<br>um and she had gone to London as many<br>people did for their OE but she went on<br>a boat um now they fly um and she ended<br>up staying in London um and just on my<br>new family I forgot how many generations<br>but my mother's about fifth generation<br>on both sides of her family um and my<br>father was always very ambitious but he<br>was from a very very very very poor<br>workingclass family so he had far more<br>opportunities in in New Zealand because<br>he left school when he was 15 um and I<br>do remember him um regarding the stories<br>oh my mother telling us that she was who<br>grew my mother grew up on a farm and you<br>know she was saying that boor with muton<br>for breakfast and my father just<br>couldn't believe as he is because mutton<br>was the home would be once a year type<br>of thing um that's a difference between<br>the two countries so anyway my parents<br>um were three small children um left<br>England when I was five you know so um<br>and came back settled in Oakland um and<br>she just bit more on History my mother<br>had gone to teachers training College in<br>Ardmore um so she was a teacher did go<br>back later in life to get a ba she came<br>came back um to Oakland part of it and<br>also on my mother's side come from a<br>very long line of farmers in fact<br>shepher one of our family names um and<br>also teachers as well so if I think i'<br>if I'd been born 20<br>years earlier I probably would have been<br>a teacher rather than an academic well I<br>am a teacher so so I'm continuing the<br>tradition now fast water generation<br>there was never a doubt that i' go to<br>university but it wasn't that<br>straightforward which she go through now<br>um my parents ran a series of businesses<br>um in<br>um uh we get schooling a second in in<br>Oakland s of garden furniture my mother<br>had a cafe on Queen Street um and then<br>it turned into office furniture and um<br>designed and manufactur into papa papa<br>only H some people may know um I used to<br>work in my father's business my parents<br>business um and I still remember the<br>smoko room when people are allowed to<br>smoke at work not allowed to do that now<br>um and I still often see the furniture<br>around or so that's what 40 odd years<br>later and it still was very wellmade<br>Furniture um one of the influences um of<br>my father was on me was he was always<br>into Tech so um which I which I do quite<br>a bit and he always had to have the<br>latest tech and I remember in the mid<br>1990s he had one of the first um<br>mass-produced cciio cameras he was very<br>proud of it remember would cost Â£1,000<br>and the pictures were terrible but<br>that's always the case with new<br>technology it's always bad at the<br>beginning then it gets better and<br>surpasses the technology it was going to<br>do um and and also another feature of<br>that is technology takes a long time so<br>I remember in the mid 1990s he had<br>excellent website okay a really good<br>website in the 1990s well most<br>businesses in New Zealand until very<br>recently didn't have websites you know<br>so well when Co came along it was a bit<br>of an issue so it takes a long time to<br>come along Now quickly on schooling now<br>I went to Michael Park School<br>rud Steiner School in um<br>Ally and very<br>different very different to the to the<br>um mainstream schools um we teach called<br>our teachers by the first name we had no<br>uniforms um and you see from the<br>buildings they were a lot different and<br>I do remember again my father was<br>complaining because these were expensive<br>buildings he said why can't you just put<br>these cheap prefabs up you know um well<br>these are still looking good 40 years<br>later they were all would they they were<br>beautiful now um Michael Park was good<br>but um it turned out um I got told<br>recently that I um basically gave to<br>teachers PTSD<br>um um and so one of the teachers was<br>talking to them at a reunion and she<br>said that the other teachers basically<br>feared teaching me um but she she<br>enjoyed teaching me I don't know why um<br>I all I can think is I asked questions<br>about the content I got bored because it<br>was easy now the other interesting thing<br>and I wish I'd known at the time was she<br>also said that there were two students<br>um during her whole career for about 40<br>years that she regarded as<br>Geniuses and it was me and someone else<br>okay they never she never told I never<br>knew this I mean I it was right but I<br>didn't know if it was that right um and<br>in fact I didn't even get into<br>University if I wanted to so we we'll<br>come back again to that now I just want<br>to do bit of a rof on that genius book<br>and explain three paradoxes because this<br>is about war other paradoxes<br>um so the first one is um is it nature<br>or nurture now if you haven't read this<br>book it's excellent It's called the<br>geography of genius<br>and what his argument was is its culture<br>and location and so there's places that<br>um around the world like ancient Greece<br>Florence silic Valley and other places<br>that it's the geography that makes it<br>okay it's not the people themselves and<br>they have things like PE there's people<br>that are B Outsiders and they discuss<br>things you know if you all get together<br>and all have to have consensus well that<br>doesn't really work so you need you need<br>it's very good book to read on that<br>another one is that IQ is not enough so<br>if you haven't read outliers please read<br>it it's a really really good book by<br>malol Gladwell and part one of the<br>stories that relates in that book is um<br>a longitudinal study in California where<br>they took these kids with IQs higher<br>than Einstein okay and it was the the<br>thesis was was these kids at 11 was so<br>brilliant that they are going to lead<br>the United States long teral study and<br>then when they went back and they found<br>that well there was a lot of them that<br>actually ended up unemployed okay even<br>okay and the thing what is how can this<br>occur and it turned out that it<br>was social economic status okay that's<br>it that's it so if if you're very bright<br>but you come from very poor family your<br>chance of success is very low so not to<br>do with that so um and then another<br>quick one is also the fix versus growth<br>mindsets so you know it's really sort of<br>dangerous to label someone for example<br>being bright um probably can't read this<br>um but you can get someone with a fixed<br>mindset is that they um they want to<br>look smart so they don't they avoid<br>challenges they give up<br>easily no point working you're either<br>bright or you're not they don't take on<br>feedback<br>um they feel threatened if other people<br>are successful and they don't achieve<br>what they could but the growth mindset<br>is um you embrace the challenges you<br>persist you see effort as a path to<br>Mastery you learn from criticism um and<br>you find lessons inspiration for SE<br>success of others and you do better so<br>it's not where you start it's your<br>attitude and at this University and<br>other places we label people I don't<br>think that's very helpful and also<br>they've done study on us where they've<br>um looked at um children they've done<br>soal tests on them and they've said to<br>um the teachers oh these kids are bright<br>and they were they were the same as<br>everyone else and a year later to go<br>back and they're performing much B<br>because the teachers treated them<br>differently so anyway let just to think<br>about now back to schooling um I will<br>might skip um some of this otherwise<br>I'll run out of time um but it was<br>interesting<br>um but oh actually one one I will do one<br>there was I was going to do three backs<br>exams because we were non-competitive so<br>we don't want<br>exams I quite competitive so it wasn't<br>good um so it's all all internally<br>assessed and we didn't do seven we<br>didn't do versy back in the day for<br>people that are older we did six one<br>certificate and it was just uh was a<br>nightmare I like tests um the new exam<br>um and<br>um because I didn't do any work because<br>it was too easy I didn't get<br>particularly good marks and because we<br>had done versary I had to apply for<br>University and I didn't bother applying<br>because of course I did not want to go<br>to university come the next year I<br>wanted to go and they wouldn't let me in<br>so um I then went overseas um oh<br>actually this sorry this slide I'm just<br>one my things um we look quite a away<br>from the University nowly we lived in<br>bay back when her Bay was really really<br>cheap it was either Bay or South which<br>seems bizarre but that literally was the<br>case and as soon as I was 15 I got my<br>license my parents had to get them one<br>part of walk to another and this was my<br>parents car that they bought new in<br>England and they brought it over because<br>at the time in the' 70s cars were<br>insanely expensive in New Zealand you<br>couldn't even buy them even if you had<br>the money restrictions so I drove that<br>around<br>umland um and I and we<br>also we had these like chicanes where<br>you went to slow down and I worked out<br>the Octoman speed for going through and<br>the back would fish tail<br>out no I never had an<br>accident I do remember a couple of<br>friends getting out of the car and<br>refusing to go anyway so be<br>um we done this morning okay now what<br>about after the S form could get<br>University so um I then went to Sydney<br>this isn't the actual flat that it was<br>similar so I was in one of those there<br>about six months or so working in<br>hospitality and then I went to London<br>cuz my parents by then had moved to<br>London so um I stay with them of course<br>as you do<br>um I during London I was there for a<br>couple years and one of the places I<br>worked was a wine bar in Fleek street<br>called Alo that's a picture of it at<br>night it was quite interesting um to<br>work there and this actually leads into<br>my choice of um mage of degree because<br>um I was trying to work out when I Was<br>preparing this why did I want to become<br>a lawyer um or study law and one of them<br>was this place it was mainly lawyers<br>that came in because it was just down<br>the road from the temple it was on stre<br>um there was also I was like watching<br>legal dramas I thought they were<br>interesting um and one of the people<br>that work there she was a lawyer from<br>New Zealand doing her OE because this is<br>how impressionable young people are so<br>yep had to do law now I couldn't get<br>into Orland because my marks were<br>hopeless um so I ended up in this place<br>in Oto this is called the hacken<br>building now called Richardson Building<br>now just on there um<br>um the the story from the slide that<br>it's taken from um is a story from Theo<br>times about the fact that the hawen<br>building had just been given you know<br>the highest status of the historic<br>placees trust okay and it was one of the<br>youngest buildings now the Paradox<br>because remember we doing LA and other<br>paradoxes is that we know what beauty is<br>don't we as people um but the Architects<br>here um thought that um they just<br>designed an ugly building and in fact<br>the trust the historic placees trust<br>acknowledged this because in the story<br>it says the hawen building was a itical<br>success with the architectural<br>profession but public resistance to its<br>particular aesthetic has not greatly<br>diminished over<br>time I actually wanted to be an<br>architect actually I didn't say that<br>when I was young um but I was hopeless<br>at physics um probably because the<br>teachers I believe<br>teachers I've since been told you don't<br>actually have to be any good at physics<br>for that um now this picture I didn't<br>play rugby um back then um 1990s not<br>many women or girls play um uh rby but<br>it is a uh picture of I mean I think<br>it's quite a good picture to represent<br>something<br>now when I had my first law tutorial so<br>I what two or three weeks of of studying<br>lectures reading some some um cases and<br>things because we had to read cases we<br>didn't read textbooks or anything um I<br>worked out and I said to the tutor I<br>said the judges just moving the goal<br>posts they're manufacturing it and<br>giving the outcome that they<br>want I should have stopped doing law if<br>if I can work that out of three weeks<br>that this is just a fast but I I I kept<br>on going<br>um uh but I was B quiet I wasn't s<br>challenging the this the lecturers at<br>all in law I just get my head down um<br>now just on this you don't have to be<br>you don't have to be anything to work<br>this out um for example this don't know<br>if I came across this case but I'll just<br>go Um through it very quickly now this<br>is a very well-known case that we teach<br>to our students sometimes well when we<br>had a stage one course we did um<br>now Lord Denning who is in the court of<br>appeal his first sentence okay so before<br>we get to it what this case was about<br>was it was about criet green like this a<br>Village Green and the balls would go SE<br>was going across and Hing people in<br>buildings and<br>so the pl wanted to close it down and<br>get Dam okay now this is what the judge<br>with I wonder who won the<br>case okay yes okay but but to be I mean<br>Dr side um judge most judges are a bit<br>more sub than there now there's a really<br>good um podcast series called more<br>perfect from um the U<br>and it goes through Supreme Court cases<br>now I don't really like law but I'll<br>listen to this um I I mean um that's why<br>I do many non law now but um so if you<br>ever if you look at the political thre<br>and what it was was about a case where<br>the<br>judges they decide the case according to<br>their ideological beliefs and this is<br>what happens in law they judges decide<br>according to their beliefs and it turned<br>out that the<br>um one I think one of the judges ended<br>up having a heart attack and the other<br>one had meal breakdown because they were<br>under such pressure from different<br>people decid it different way so anyway<br>listen to that one it's quite<br>interesting and it might s of shatter<br>your Illusions about law now coming back<br>to University um actually um now just<br>Hest very very um quickly is that this<br>is back um in University of tago to get<br>into the LLB you had to do two law<br>courses and then chose other courses<br>that you could do um now I made an error<br>while fting in the forms this was all<br>paper forms we didn't have you know<br>computers back then um and I me to<br>enroll in Philosophy for two courses and<br>I end up in<br>Psychology they both start with me but I<br>don't know and so I didn't know how to<br>change so I ended up with them and um<br>now I'd never remember i' never done an<br>exam before going to University and I<br>remember distinctly<br>first exam and this was full semesters<br>full years we didn't have semesters so<br>full year um I multi Choice was fine and<br>then when I had to do a written one I I<br>just panicked and I couldn't remember<br>anything and I just wrote luckily I<br>prepared very well and I actually went<br>A+ last day CL um next time next other<br>psychology one I got an A so very good<br>now normally youd be invited to do<br>honors because you did well but I think<br>I filled in a survey when I said that<br>psychology was load of rubbish so<br>they so of a p occuring here um also I<br>did education paper um because people<br>said it was really<br>easy I got my S Mark that um and I also<br>did accounting because that was mentally<br>easy and I got really bad but for that<br>as well and I teach accountants but<br>luckily I don't teach them accountant um<br>the other thing this would of a paradox<br>is remember I had to do two law courses<br>one of them I actually got an A CL 4 um<br>the other one I got a uh sees which is<br>bizarre I mean how could you and know<br>that was enough to get through but it<br>was<br>just weird but anyway got that um now my<br>second year at ATO I met my partner<br>Michael and we are still uh together and<br>um two children B University um my<br>daughter Beth is in her final year down<br>in Massie doing passion design um<br>Wellington and my son George who's here<br>tonight is in the second year at A2 a<br>doing Communications so I'm just jumping<br>portrait<br>um so my daughter is there she's a man<br>um and my son is a creepy robot um so<br>that was a and in fact the family takes<br>um spany very seriously and that was so<br>good her headless man that they thought<br>she was a member of m m stuff and she<br>didn't now the next year we going to<br>make an effort so she was a headless<br>woman but not just that she did it I<br>Haven a photo so that her head was like<br>this so it looked like she was carrying<br>her Sate head um and she should have won<br>I mean when you walk down everyone was<br>stopping and taking photographs you know<br>with it because it was so good um but<br>the family joke is when it came she got<br>much made the finals and she was beaten<br>so luckily she was a bit older this was<br>2012 so she was about 12 so that was<br>okay she being younger that would have<br>been you know traumatic Now quickly<br>after the university I went back to um<br>to um London because I didn't get into<br>professionals so profs so and then I<br>dragged my partner Michael with me so he<br>duely came along um which was good<br>otherwise we wouldn't be together so<br>another 2 years again um I was just<br>working and um as you're working with my<br>parents<br>now and then I decided that I wanted to<br>come back and I applied actually applied<br>for the hour in festival and I got a so<br>I had a la degree now um but when I was<br>animals and then I saw this poster was<br>incom law it looked much more exciting<br>than I done of commercial law so I I<br>transferred that one which I thought was<br>a bit a bit better um and before I go<br>this one now okay so I did that and then<br>also we the incom law was like a t<br>Masters so some of you will know what a<br>t Masters is instead of doing a big sort<br>of dissertation or or thesis you do<br>courses and back then it was slightly<br>different because we had to do like<br>6,000 word um assignments but I went<br>over I think my longest was 16,000 words<br>now you wouldn't be able to do that but<br>I was sort of encouraged to do that and<br>then the head of depart said you want a<br>job I yep and he said look I don't know<br>whether it will be a tutor or a lecturer<br>or parttime or fulltime so I don't know<br>I turned up on January and I opened it<br>and it was a full-time lecture for one<br>year now you know how to do oneyear<br>contracts now okay um but the then here<br>Department did that all the time it's a<br>really good idea because you get to see<br>what people are like um and it was<br>getting near the end of the first year<br>and we had bought our first house in<br>Kingsland now this looks a bit flasher<br>Kingsland was a bit rough in the year<br>2000 um lot rougher than that and we<br>said do I have a job um and yes I had a<br>job I had another two-year job which<br>again was quite unusual and then the um<br>head of department they then<br>manufactured two jobs one for me and<br>someone else and we didn't know that we<br>just we applied for it and we got it and<br>coincident the other person to get it<br>he's also been promoted Professor this<br>year so it's taking taking us a while to<br>get<br>here so<br>um the this is actually this image um<br>when my um children were young I lied to<br>them and I said that a princess lived at<br>the top of that house<br>and they believed me for a long long<br>long time um yes now just another sort<br>of um<br>paradx um with um jobs especially I'm<br>always telling students that it's the<br>networks and the connections they make<br>at University which were the most<br>important thing much more important um<br>than grades and as by way of sort of<br>evidence of that um my P Michael he got<br>his job this way because he'd gone for a<br>job at Datacom and failed to get the job<br>and then a friend of mine from school he<br>then said what about this person there's<br>a 3 month contract coming out why don't<br>you just try them out and the guy the<br>manager goes oh well might doesn't try<br>again no doesn't work it doesn't work um<br>and then by the end of the 3 months<br>again we were nervous was there a job<br>and yes there was and he was there for<br>the next 20 OD years um but again it's<br>because those trials you can kiss<br>someone that you wouldn't normally um<br>kissed out and then irony is when that<br>when that manager left he then said that<br>Michael was the best person he'd ever<br>HDE and he forgot that he'd actually<br>rejected but um we didn't point that out<br>to him at all um now um so we've got<br>we've got that now<br>um jumping a a<br>bit so this is an old map of the<br>University okay so some of you may<br>remember it um and and business school<br>where's the business<br>school there's nothing there because it<br>wasn't there okay this was in<br>2000 um but the uh um business<br>school as a faculty was all over the<br>show so for some reason this actually<br>came up I didn't color this this was<br>actually online I went to the way back<br>machine and so um the everything in red<br>is the is the business school and so<br>because of this because we were so<br>dispersed um I actually knew far more<br>people outside the faculty than inside<br>the faculty and our then head of<br>Department made sure of that and he had<br>a saying that um the mountains are high<br>and the emperor is far away so the<br>emperor was the dean Sor Barry I think<br>what um yes it's Miss old car is it oh<br>okay no no it's it's fine now being so<br>we so where we were so we were up there<br>so we were at the sort of the farest bit<br>we're now and L is now in that building<br>now why I'm showing you this is because<br>my first ever lecture was in b28 which<br>is there and that at the time was the<br>biggest lecture theater in the<br>University over 400 people this was<br>before the business school was built and<br>I had so my first ever said my first<br>ever lecture was to uh Comm 101 over 400<br>students it was on contract law burned<br>in my brain and um I was quite nervous<br>because I done tutorials which are fine<br>but 400 people in a room it's a lot of<br>people<br>now but back then I was quite nervous<br>and I had prepared extensively I had<br>completely written out notes which I now<br>would be able to do for a class I have<br>done some notes for this one so I don't<br>forget um so had everything<br>and had it all sorted out and when I<br>went to get everything out I suddenly<br>realized my notes aren't there and so it<br>was like rabbit in the headlights I was<br>thinking what do do I run it's over 5<br>minutes each way and so I'll be late and<br>I<br>went no I didn't run um luckily I was<br>again a bit like that psychology exam I<br>was overprepared and plus I had the<br>benefits of overhead uh projector with<br>transparencies now some of you won't<br>is so this is St<br>of so what we would do is we had to<br>photo we had these transparent sheets<br>and your photo copy and put them up um<br>and so wouldn't to see them from the<br>back of the room with these huge but we<br>used that um those things so that was<br>that was okay and but that's actually is<br>luxury because I remember when I was at<br>law school we didn't even have that all<br>it was was a person talking and we were<br>writing and it was quite funny because<br>I'm not the best speller um and then I<br>would be writing out all the names of<br>these cases and then trying to find them<br>later and they B no resemblance at all<br>to it I mean they were just doing it to<br>they could have at least written<br>something up on the board but no and so<br>now you get students that are<br>complaining about<br>hand I don't have any sympathy um but I<br>can't say<br>that um now okay so we done that<br>now outside the university um one of the<br>reason why there's quite a broad range<br>of people here is because um and one of<br>the reasons why I was promoted to the<br>professor is because of outside<br>activities um now I'm just going through<br>a few of them that I've done over the<br>years but not all of them and also just<br>bit of fun I've used the Wayback machine<br>to get pictures of websites as they were<br>at the time<br>um now I'm I I must admit that um some<br>of my external stuff came at a detriment<br>to my family so I do remember one time<br>um when my son was small I was reading a<br>books by that stage my daughter did not<br>want me to read her books um she's<br>always being rather independent anyway<br>so I'd read books to my son and a had<br>spal meeting because they were all um in<br>person I'd set an alarm so I go off and<br>I knew I to get up and then go out um<br>now I remember one time my son who I<br>don't know how old he was four or five<br>and he said he said you Mom um you go a<br>meeting tonight and I said no he goes<br>good you could read me more which was<br>sort of but then I guess you know he<br>now you know um but there's that but at<br>least you know I I did that um now first<br>my first thing um actually working not<br>working being volunteer for planket I<br>was say this is really sort of um early<br>2000s website deliberately um I ended up<br>I don't know how I can't remember um<br>being on the volunteer committee for the<br>family centers ended up you treasure<br>prison and I must admit I end we ended<br>up selling um we were the uh plunet Road<br>um landscape Road plunet Landscape Road<br>Mount Eden and we also sold the one in<br>um uh what you call it um Pon b as well<br>to set up one a new one that was running<br>the full time cuz we had these two that<br>weren't running very well another thing<br>legal Research Foundation um one of the<br>roles there was co-organizing the um uh<br>the co annual writing Awards um when I<br>got to that role there were no rules so<br>I had to write the rules which c a few<br>ruckuses but that's okay um consumer New<br>Zealand because I do believe that<br>academic should be actively involved in<br>um in fact involvement or knowledge in<br>the areas that they're teaching and<br>researching in so I did actually ask<br>someone to nominate me for this to be on<br>the board and I was there for about six<br>years part of that was his Deputy um<br>chair now when I was on consumer I was<br>then asked could I be a consumer rep on<br>the telecommunication dispute resolution<br>and if you don't know about it it's a<br>really good thing if you've got a<br>dispute with your Telco so for example<br>one or um that was vone um spark is that<br>you can it's free okay unlike the<br>disputes tribunal where you've got to<br>pay a whole lot of money um and but no<br>one knows about it which is a Pity um<br>also I end up on gr and Farmers Market I<br>go there all the time end up as a<br>secretary because no one else wanted to<br>do that<br>um blockchain NZ got nominated for that<br>um which is bit that's been really<br>interesting again that industry<br>um academic Nexus which has been good um<br>now inside the<br>university G I've done lots and lots of<br>different roles within the department<br>that in by the University<br>um but just one thing I do want to<br>quickly go over is stuff I've done with<br>tu so this is the Union uh the main<br>um well before I get to this one um I<br>start out the branch committee ended up<br>being the secretary then ended up at the<br>as a woman's committee then the vice<br>president woman all these different<br>things and during that part of it we had<br>this bitter industrial campaign<br>um for about 18 months and I was on The<br>Barking committee and it turned out to<br>be posters I didn't want them made but<br>they had them made and they asked me<br>could they use them and it's like well<br>you've already got them made so you um<br>but it's a bit disconcerting when when I<br>used to go into departments and you see<br>post I didn't want to be but it came in<br>handy later now um the<br>um another thing with the Union when I<br>was on it was that we had an<br>endorsements policy so we had lots of<br>commies at this University and people<br>run for them and it was a case if we if<br>Union endorses someone they will get in<br>because union members will vote for them<br>and um I rewrote the policy and I wanted<br>it so that if there was only one<br>position only one would endorse one pit<br>but the rest of the committee said no we<br>can't do that we can't pick people we'll<br>just endorse everybody and I said that<br>won't work because you have other people<br>get in so but I left it because they<br>were arguing you can do what you want<br>well I had to last laugh two years later<br>they changed it because of course it<br>wasn't working properly um now just<br>start this also um with the This Bitter<br>industrial campaign um there was a seat<br>going on University Council and I was<br>asked to put my name forward and I said<br>I can't do this and I said please can<br>you please do it and also there was a<br>vote coming up as part of the industrial<br>campaign<br>and we needed someone to be there and I<br>worked out that if I got in I couldn't<br>make that first meeting but there was<br>someone else who's also running who's<br>also a um a union member and I phoned<br>her up and said look I can't make that<br>meeting so if you can make the meeting<br>I'll take my name off and you one and<br>she said no no she couldn't make it so<br>stayed on and got on councel<br>um which again accidentally because I<br>didn't really um mean to to get on there<br>ma was there for nine years but also I<br>again the endorsement okay because which<br>I Probot which I I didn't intend to help<br>me at all um I also didn't apply for<br>another s another term because I don't<br>think people should be in positions for<br>too long you need that cycling through<br>people um<br>so and now just as part of this<br>industrial um campaign we had these<br>rosettes in I've got one here I found it<br>today which are very subtle um and<br>what say thank you students for<br>supporting staff was that some of the<br>students were wearing these but they<br>were refused to graduate if they were<br>wearing so so it was terrible for the<br>University but I was on Council and so I<br>had one on and when I went into the room<br>with all council members you could tell<br>they were Furious they couldn't say<br>anything but then I was sitting in the<br>front row because that's where the<br>council members sat and someone was<br>telling me later because they have<br>I so it's quite funny anyway um oh<br>actually just a fun fact this guy B<br>Harbor um he was doing law and I got<br>called up for jury service last year and<br>he was one of the lawyers there and so I<br>had spoken to him for what 12 years and<br>I was about to go up to the judge saying<br>I knew him and he said objection so I<br>had to walk<br>off now another quick thing um we also<br>at this time of this industrial dispute<br>about 12 13 years ago we brought in some<br>the PTF positions now I don't know any I<br>remember but this fly was doing the<br>rounds I won't show I can show I can<br>send it to you later if you want Andrew<br>and I did this but I my name wasn't on<br>okay just to explain the two so it was a<br>bit of subverse of things now you might<br>think I'm a pain which I am but it's not<br>all painful so one of the things that we<br>did um with the TU we had a good<br>relationship with like Equity office and<br>HR and we in one of the things that we<br>did was to create the salary sacrifice<br>of for early childhood education fees<br>and I worked out that if to my kids to<br>the University of Crash that if it had<br>been operating I would have saved<br>$10,000 a year okay so it's a lot of<br>money but by the time we got it up my<br>kids went in PR so but it was never for<br>me so that was a positive thing and it's<br>still running today now quickly research<br>and Publications um<br>so so much now as um and you said I've<br>got um three main areas of research um<br>first one was copyright law so it's what<br>I started with um now the thing with<br>copyright law and in property laws in<br>general is that if there's too much<br>protection actually style<br>creativity and um blockchain which I'll<br>get to in a second and I wrote something<br>on that you know because blockchain has<br>developed so quickly because there was<br>no intellectual property rights okay so<br>again another<br>Paradox now also there's a good<br>um with copyright copyright is meant to<br>protect creators but it doesn't and in<br>fact the first Copyright Act statue<br>about 1709 or 1710 depending on how you<br>view it it was never the artists or the<br>authors that were seeking copyright<br>protection it was the Publishers um and<br>what this slide is about is there is an<br>artist and Dean Harvey who is a<br>full-time artist and he wasn't making<br>much money at all but now through nfts<br>he's actually making a living of them so<br>you don't need copyright to actually<br>make<br>money now conuma law is my was my next<br>one and one of the areas I did was<br>unfair contract terms and<br>um I have a saying that the law is<br>useless okay because we got these laws<br>but they're not necessarily followed so<br>we had this new law that was going to<br>come in and I thought it's not going to<br>work and so what I did was I got a<br>student to take a whole lot of contracts<br>and new contracts and analyze them to<br>see if there had been unfair contract<br>terms in them and then I got it this is<br>before the law came into effect and<br>after the law nine months later I got<br>another student to look at the same<br>contracts to see whether there' been a<br>reduction of contract terms now the<br>there was a massive number of unfair<br>contract terms before and then<br>afterwards they'd only been reduced by<br>10% so it effectively had very little um<br>effect now why did I know it wouldn't<br>have an effect or not much of an effect<br>is because we've got this law but you<br>can't enforce it only the Commerce<br>Commission can and so I've done a whole<br>lot of work basically arguing the com<br>that it should be other people that can<br>also enforce it so um with unfair<br>contract terms it's not just a case of I<br>think it's unfair there are There are<br>rules um but I'll just give you a quick<br>couple of um examples on contractor so<br>say for example you enter into a<br>contract um for Broadband for $80 a<br>month for 12 months ter and and the term<br>in that contract allows the retailer to<br>change the terms and conditions at any<br>time okay that used to be quite common<br>um and say the retailer increases the<br>cost $140 halfway through um and you<br>can't terminate early well that means<br>you're stuck paying an extra $60 a month<br>another one might be this is a real one<br>um a termin a gy contract that says even<br>if the gy were to move location up to 12<br>km away you still have to pay the<br>membership fees okay so there are<br>examples of unfair contract terms but at<br>the moment you can't do anything about<br>it what you can do is ask the Commerce<br>Commission and the Commerce Commission<br>hasn't done very much it's done a little<br>bit one of the things it has done is<br>work with hot you know the hot cards<br>because it changed like 20 because they<br>were just reaching you know lots of<br>different laws so one of the things that<br>I mean I'm sure it doesn't happen anyone<br>in this room but a lot of people some<br>people think that businesses follow the<br>law okay um and that even if they're not<br>following the law someone is actually<br>checking and enforcing the law well not<br>that often doesn't occur and so that was<br>an article we wrote on it<br>now NB the ministry for business<br>Innovation and<br>employment I think questioned the study<br>because it was so bad and so what it did<br>was replicated the state and so I handed<br>over all my work everything like that it<br>was checked and it was correct and then<br>they got a student then to to go and<br>find the most recent contract so was a<br>couple of years later to see whether<br>there had been some change now um we'll<br>do a bit a full experiment very quickly<br>okay so you're in business and you hear<br>about a new law down contract terms law<br>but you see that no enforcement is<br>happening um and the customers can't<br>challenge the unfair contract terms okay<br>what would you do um well you're<br>ethically you change your contract would<br>you yes um now do all or most businesses<br>act<br>ethically I'm always telling they not<br>about it but the short answer is no they<br>don't and so when this was<br>repeated there were more<br>unfair because why not and actually at<br>at the end but I didn't do any of the<br>analysis I just helped write it so so<br>it's there so my work was clean and and<br>what we also wrote as a a piece um for<br>the public in this um the conversation<br>now another Factor another Paradox is<br>that reputation is often more important<br>than law okay so for example plagiarism<br>so if you're an academic and you<br>plagiarize you can lose your position<br>but he haven't broken the law so this<br>why law is and business yeah um another<br>quick one is blockchain um I got<br>involved in blockchain run out the time<br>but um basically I listened to two<br>podcasts back to back one was Canadian<br>one was New Zealander talking about<br>smart contract ethereum and I went oh my<br>god I've got to do this and I ended up<br>um doing a big report and I've done a<br>whole lot of other things things as well<br>um and then as part of it I also did a<br>very belated PhD which is unusual<br>because normally now you can't even get<br>an academic position without a PhD um<br>some exceptions and um and also just<br>make part of most of this is not on law<br>it's on economics I've never studied<br>economics um also I didn't do like<br>historical one I was doing as the<br>centralized autonomous organizations<br>were on the rise when I started doing it<br>I set up a Google alert for DS and<br>decentralized tus organizations there<br>was about a hit every two weeks but now<br>when I finished it was like 10 a day you<br>know so this whole thing was was was<br>going up but that was a useful exercise<br>I always had the typical thing where one<br>of my my main supervisor left got made<br>redundant hope someone else come through<br>so it was a useful learning exercise now<br>very quickly um couple I put this in the<br>sort of title um for this talk<br>why are people to pay significant sums<br>of money for digital files anyone can<br>copy with the rice right Mouse CL um<br>well perceptions are value because<br>people are weird um now you can buy a<br>rare you know this guitar for this much<br>last year you could<br>okay but the same make model guitar sold<br>you know for 2.1 million<br>us<br>why well because because it was magic<br>magic you know it's no different I mean<br>you have the two they're identical okay<br>so you know perceptions are weird um so<br>the digital art nfts aren't worthless<br>even though anyone can copy them because<br>if you copy you don't own it and<br>ownership is important because people<br>like to own things we' just seen that<br>with John lon's guitar they want that<br>guitar not that<br>guitar um and you can show ownership so<br>for example on Twitter you could show um<br>the only the owner certain nfts could<br>use them on Twitter for their profile<br>pictures um and when you're in the<br>metaverse only owners will be able to<br>display the nft so you can show<br>that um and there's been a lot of hype<br>over nfts and stupid amounts of money<br>being paid um but new technology that<br>normally<br>happens um now a common thing and I'll<br>just finish with one minute um I thought<br>it was about<br>technology but but then I think why why<br>do we have<br>technology well maybe it's about human<br>flourishing isn't it why we have<br>technology to help us now I'm sort of<br>walking back on a whole lot of things<br>because I've realized as other people<br>may have out the technolog is not really<br>helping us at the<br>moment you know people's mental health<br>and all sorts of things so what drew me<br>to blockchain in the first place which<br>was the ability to enforce the law is<br>now making me really nervous because it<br>may not be a good thing um so I'm a bit<br>having I'm being a bit ambivalent over<br>it um it's fine if everything is<br>decentralized and people have control<br>about what they want to do but the worry<br>is is that we may lose control you won't<br>be able to pay what you want you may<br>have restrictions imposed on um on you<br>for example you may not be able to book<br>an airline ticket um if for example your<br>power<br>credit allowance has been exceeded so<br>yeah<br>so I will end there a bit of a<br>provocative<br>not uh well one one or two questions<br>what what are you excited about sing<br>your next I don't<br>know oh no um Andrew mentioned right to<br>repair so um I'd be doing a whole lot on<br>that and and I'll keep on doing because<br>that's<br>um I didn't mention it I will quickly<br>and this relates to the software as well<br>that more and more products be being<br>ided with software that's venting people<br>from even using it so classic example<br>was this has just happened last year or<br>two someone had a Tesla and they wanted<br>they wanted to put a toe bar on it or H<br>they call it America they didn't Tesla<br>didn't have any so this person then went<br>to a reable place to get the toeb bar<br>installed and then he found out Tesla<br>and said oh can you activate the<br>software so I can use it and they said<br>no you can't use it the<br>time printers for example if you they<br>now sell on subscription basis and if<br>you don't keep on paying the<br>subscription it stops and so it's that's<br>my something I've really been interested<br>so I'm doing more on that that's a a<br>really big issue for us all and people<br>have been talking about this for a long<br>time but it's coming to fruition now<br>there's a really good book no called<br>unauthorized bread if you read that it's<br>quite scary um and also just on that<br>coming back to copyright law which was<br>my main area before is that if you've<br>got someone who has to like you know<br>jailbreak something to fix it or to<br>modify<br>Zealand yeah which should not be the<br>that's one of the things I've observed<br>is that people trying to regulate<br>techology don't understand because a lot<br>of them are lawyers seem very skobic so<br>do do you think that's an issue and we<br>need to about<br>that um yes but Al yes it be good to<br>have different people in the room but<br>also things move so fast and the legal<br>is so slow so that's an issue so I don't<br>that so<br>okayy Alex thank you so much for sharing<br>your knowledge with us um I've got to<br>know as well um certainly um the<br>coverage of paradoxes is very<br>interesting and it was really<br>fascinating to hear about your current<br>interest in way your research might be<br>going into the future as well so um</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
