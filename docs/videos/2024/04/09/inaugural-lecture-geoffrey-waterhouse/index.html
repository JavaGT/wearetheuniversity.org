hosking I'm the den of<br>science here at the University of<br>ockland and it's my very great pleasure<br>to welcome you both to the university<br>and also to the inaugural lecture of<br>Professor Jeffrey Waterhouse the first<br>science inaugural lecturer of the year<br>uh and I begin with an apology apology<br>for the uh late shifting a venue we've<br>had uh intermittent power issues in<br>building 303 we thought it was just a<br>little bit too ironic to have a a<br>lecture involving alternative energy<br>storage being canned by a lack of<br>power so uh warm welcome to Jeff's<br>Family sitting in the the front row glad<br>to have you here Jeff works at The<br>Cutting Edge of green chemistry with a<br>focus on addressing key science<br>challenges between behind s several of<br>the UN sustainable development goals<br>such as decarbonization of society ution<br>abatement and human health much of his<br>work focuses on developing nanocatalysts<br>for a wide range of chemical<br>Transformations most of which support<br>decarbonization of the global energy<br>sector major result of his research has<br>been the discovery of lowcost catalysts<br>for water splitting and oxygen reduction<br>Evolution reactions which are key<br>processes and water electrolyzers fuel C<br>cells and metal air batteries the also<br>works in the area of lowcost optical<br>photoelectrochemical and electrochemical<br>sensors for environmental monitoring and<br>the detection of threat in Foods threats<br>and<br>Foods Giff has been amply recognized for<br>his work including receiving a<br>university of Oakland research<br>Excellence medal the New Zealand<br>Association of scientists shortland<br>medal the Royal Society tarangi mcdad<br>midle and a James Cook Fellowship as<br>well as consistently being rated by<br>Claret as a high highly related sorry<br>highly cited<br>researcher he's also a distinguished<br>professor at Hanan<br>University Jeff is an ockland graduate<br>one of our own undertaking bachelor's<br>Masters and PhD here probably<br>appropriate he's in the clock tower then<br>for this uh this<br>lecture uh before joining the staff<br>initially as a research fellow then<br>later as a senior lecturer and associate<br>professor before his most re recent<br>promotion to Professor which was<br>celebrating<br>tonight tonight Jeff is going to talk to<br>us about nanospace the final frontier as<br>it says up<br>there uh in doing so he will attempt to<br>matter his motto perhaps could be from<br>Small Things big things grow Jeff the<br>yours<br>uh Kato welcome everyone thank you John<br>for that introduction it was a very good<br>bio I think I'll use that myself later<br>on in<br>life oh yeah very good yeah obviously<br>looking around the audience here it's a<br>trip down memory lane I can see people I<br>studied with here as a student at Oran<br>University uh people I was taught by uh<br>people I have since taught um people<br>I've met in other walks of life at later<br>stages of my professional career<br>um some of you I haven't seen before and<br>may have just been here for the catering<br>that's fine I used to do that myself<br>when I was a student uh but obviously<br>it's an honor to have my parents here so<br>my lovely wife D sha our daughter Jane<br>her fiance Matthew and of course my<br>parents Joan and Jeff senior aged 84 and<br>85 respectively about 52 years ago they<br>started to do these sort of Gene<br>engineering experiments and eventually<br>eventually those experim have produced<br>the University of Oakland Professor so<br>Dad uh yeah so I'm preparing this<br>lecture like all people delivering an<br>augural lecture need to do you need to<br>say what is an inaugural lecture um it's<br>quite different to a normal presentation<br>you'd give at a conference so I had to<br>look at a number of universities<br>descriptions of what an inaugural<br>lecture is um to try and get a sense of<br>what I was supposed to present here<br>today the first one reads a bit like I'm<br>under examination so I didn't really<br>like<br>that but if you read down and go through<br>these things you find out that actually<br>it's more about Reminiscing on your<br>experiences that have led you to this<br>point uh thanking a lot of people<br>because no one gets to professor at a<br>university without a lot of people<br>supporting them on the way and there are<br>many people in this audience who have<br>helped me on my journey so you have my<br>great appreciation your supposed to try<br>and entertain and Inspire and that's<br>what I want to do I don't just limit it<br>to inspiring young people old people can<br>be inspired as well University of<br>Oakland you know we don't discriminate<br>based on age so let's try and Inspire<br>young and<br>old so John's talked a bit about my bio<br>obviously I'm very proud of where I've<br>got to at this stage of my professional<br>career but really this tells nothing<br>about the journey to get here um so I've<br>had some luck some Fortune along the way<br>a lot of ups and downs so it's up and<br>down journey I want to share with you<br>today because I think it's more<br>interesting than just reading about<br>where I am at this point in my life so<br>1972 great year of music for those of<br>you who are familiar with it but I got<br>my first promotion getting out of that<br>sort of embryonic fluid getting out in<br>the world seeing what's happening where<br>I could have<br>impact um then I did my primary<br>schooling at Sylvia Park School in Mount<br>Wellington followed by high schooling at<br>Penrose High School interestingly we'd<br>come into to the university for our 7th<br>form or year 13 exams a lot of mine were<br>held in medium chemistry uh where I<br>subsequently you know did a lot of<br>lecturing in later life so that was<br>quite interesting I then did a BC<br>majoring in chemistry uh taught by a lot<br>of people in the room tonight I was in<br>Brent cpp's first lecture at the<br>University here um you might say that<br>you know the positive confidence he got<br>from that experience has enabled him to<br>go on become one of our finest teachers<br>here at the University I subsequently<br>did msc's and phds here at the<br>University of Oakland uh towards the end<br>of my PhD I dabbled a bit with food<br>science being hired as a research fellow<br>to help develop some of their new labs<br>for undergraduate programs then doing a<br>post-doctoral fellowship in the area of<br>nanocatalysis some of which I'm going to<br>talk to you tonight<br>about sort of came back to the<br>University of Oakland late 2007 flirted<br>around on fixed term contracts for about<br>5 or 6 years before finally getting<br>tenure at the ripe old age of 40 by the<br>time people in our our school our<br>faculty are already becoming professors<br>so that was an<br>experience um sorry just there<br>yeah sliding okay and then obviously<br>delighted with this recent uh promotion<br>to professors so definitely a<br>interesting career with more ups and<br>downs than a pogo stick some of you<br>might know what a pogo stick stickers<br>it's a device you jump up and down on<br>like<br>this let's talk about the younger years<br>cuz a lot of my Inspirations for<br>becoming a scientists came from my<br>younger years so the photo on the left<br>that shows dad me I think it's probably<br>under the age of one at that time with<br>my older brother David we'll talk a bit<br>about him later obviously mom here uh me<br>again I think this was our tent from<br>memory this brown one with the green lid<br>I don't know about these old cars here<br>it's making me feel feel old seeing the<br>design of those but obviously I<br>developed an interest in water and this<br>has continued on with my current<br>research at the University of Oakland<br>where we're trying to make fuels from<br>water in particular<br>hydrogen so if you're doing experiments<br>you got to make sure you're not<br>introducing contaminants into your<br>experiments and this was a step I<br>learned early on that don't pee in the<br>pedaling pool that affects all the<br>experiments you want to do with water<br>interestingly in the background there<br>you see a garage okay about 5 years<br>later that garage burnt<br>down dad had left a can of kerosene open<br>my brother was David who you saw earlier<br>was playing around in there somehow a<br>spark got into the kerosene can Mom Dad<br>and I were driving down our road going<br>oh there's a fire in our straight and it<br>turns out it was our garage that was um<br>burning down so that was an interesting<br>experience and that taught me another<br>thing that kerosene and air and a spark<br>equals trouble if you're not balancing<br>the composition and burn rate so that's<br>another valuable science lesson I<br>learned at a young<br>age and of course a lot of what I do<br>about nanotechnology scale is important<br>so this was me at a young age where I<br>had to communicate to mamas how big the<br>fish was That Got Away uh when Dad was<br>fishing uh and obviously leadership<br>roles this is really important in<br>becoming professors so here's me leading<br>the design of some massive<br>build obviously you can't be outside all<br>all the time I mean I like to be outside<br>as a kid often would come back in summer<br>at like 9:00 p.m. at night just when it<br>got dark uh so on rainy days we used to<br>watch a lot of Science Fiction mom is a<br>big science fiction buff so Doctor Who<br>Battle Star Galactica these were all TV<br>series at the time I like the original<br>Star Trek episode and there's one<br>particular episode normally with Star<br>Trek you're thinking about people with<br>phases people with communicators people<br>with<br>teleportation from the surface of a<br>planet up to the Enterprise<br>in this episode all that technology was<br>taken away and Kirk had to battle this<br>reptilian creature called a gor with his<br>bare hands slow moving but much stronger<br>than he was but it turns out this rocky<br>planet had a lot of minerals on its<br>surface and so here you can see him<br>collecting sulfur potassium nitrate<br>carbon combining these to make gunpowder<br>stuffing it into a bit of bamboo and the<br>projectiles he used with these large<br>Rock<br>diamonds as a result he was able to<br>decapitate or injure anyway uh this Gorn<br>in the end he spared it he didn't kill<br>it uh I'm not sure that angle would have<br>actually led to um the projectiles<br>hitting the gor but anyway this inspired<br>me to do more chemistry of course then<br>you need a bit of schooling if you want<br>to develop your habit or your interests<br>um so these are my primary school days<br>this was my first year at Primary School<br>most of the year I was at primary school<br>I was wearing jerseys nuted by my mom um<br>very stylish obviously the tab collars<br>gone out of fashion<br>but uh very interesting nonetheless and<br>of course another promotion going from<br>Junior 1 year to Junior 2 very important<br>in my early<br>development of course you have to be<br>media Savvy if you're an academic and I<br>had a lot of exposure to this when I was<br>young um obviously teacher retires it's<br>a big deal in the local rag I think this<br>was the Eastern Courier<br>and of course I enjoyed Outdoors so I<br>was part of Cubs and you go on these<br>camps this was going to mahe Island for<br>uh a week or so yeah great times and of<br>course you get badges for achieving<br>different things when you're a cub<br>forgot to put them in my promotion<br>application might have helped I'm not<br>sure but also the toys you're given when<br>you're young you know looking back now<br>this was 1978 when I was 6 years old I<br>collected this toy range called<br>micronauts look at the names of the toy<br>neon Orbiter thorium Orbiter rodium<br>order all all elements of the periodic<br>table you know so there's this subtle<br>influence there's even a bit of French<br>here on the<br>box I don't know what it's about but of<br>course then things start to get a bit<br>more seriously two Christmases later<br>these were the books I was given the<br>McDonald Encyclopedia of rocks and<br>minerals this aligned perfectly with our<br>interest in rock hounding traveling to<br>places collecting rocks from different<br>places trying to identify what they were<br>obviously this piece of obsidian I found<br>on one of our holidays to the coramandel<br>with this nice conoidal fracture<br>perfectly matched what was in the book<br>so we were gone this is another book<br>which I think all families should have<br>um the birds of New Zealand I'm a big<br>fan of sort of birds and watching them<br>and we'll talk about that a bit more<br>later okay but some science questions<br>emerg from my youth I mean you've<br>probably all had the same questions and<br>I'm here to answer those questions so<br>why do leaves change color in<br>Autumn we used to climb trees a lot and<br>you'd find nests why are Dove's eggs<br>white why are black bird's eggs blue<br>with these Brown<br>Speckles what are those gold spots on a<br>monic butterfly Crysis real gold this is<br>what people told me because they didn't<br>know any better and then you realize not<br>all colors the same some objects change<br>color with viewing angle like a power<br>shell or um a house flight they got the<br>shiny iridescence on there so what are<br>the origins of these things these were<br>Mysteries I had from quite a young age<br>so then you hit high school and you're<br>hoping that you'll start to learn how<br>you can explain things so this was the<br>front cover of our 1988 yearbook looking<br>up at wry Hill when there was still a<br>tree at the summit you see some barb<br>wire on the fence that was from our<br>swing pool it was designed to keep<br>people out rather than students in um<br>the tree uh the school underwent a name<br>change uh in 2008 this was after the<br>tree had been cut down the name change<br>was from Penrose High School to One Tree<br>Hill College so the current name's a bit<br>of a misnomer um so that's an<br>interesting fact another interesting<br>fact this school is a breeding ground<br>for school of chemical Sciences<br>professors so I wasn't the first there's<br>another uh Bob are you here<br>Bob he there oh sorry I didn't recognize<br>you with that<br>beard he's<br>Incognito yeah so obviously Bob's<br>achieved this Milestone before I did and<br>uh he's a good friend of mine so he<br>won't mind that little laugh and of<br>course I have great memories of my time<br>at that school it's not one of the great<br>academic schools not one of the biggest<br>but we had a really good cohort of<br>students go through the school at the<br>same time I did and excellent teachers<br>really committed teachers some of them<br>like had done master's degrees in<br>physics and chemistry at this University<br>they knew what they were doing so I did<br>well academically and really excelled in<br>sports um so that's something that's<br>interesting at that time there was a<br>television program called its academic<br>um I'm sure some of you will be familiar<br>with the UK UK program University<br>challenge where different universities<br>go and they answer quiz questions and<br>then they try and get the maximum number<br>of points so this was a school uh thing<br>for students up to their form year where<br>you go compete against other schools our<br>school had bombed for 5 years in a row<br>and this is all televised so you know<br>really low scores the students just<br>getting ridiculed when they came back to<br>school so the year we went on actually<br>uh we won the first round and<br>interestingly we we took down the might<br>of Epsom Girls<br>Grammar why does this make me happy my<br>mom went to that<br>school but subsequently so did our<br>daughter<br>um so there's and we live right next to<br>that school now so it's a very<br>interesting<br>Association and of course I did well in<br>sports Athletics Cricket football and I<br>was the senior Sports boy of the year in<br>my sixth form year so something I'm<br>proud of my sister Maria she wanted in<br>her sixth and seventh form years and was<br>also head girls so she's got bragging<br>rights over me as far as I'm concern so<br>we finally get to the seventh form year<br>which is now year 13 I took three<br>Sciences and two maths got an aurer<br>again you think about the cohort the<br>previous year there had been three<br>Aeries across the seventh form year the<br>year I went through I think we had an 11<br>um so that was a really important<br>milestone for the school uh and I also<br>played representative Cricket in the<br>same year playing in the national<br>tournament at Wellington so this was a<br>conundrum for me Academia or<br>professional<br>sport so I arrived at the University in<br>1991 enrolled in a b<br>still struggling with this tertiary<br>studies or spend the New Zealand winter<br>playing Cricket in the UK trying to get<br>into maybe first class Cricket so I<br>decided okay I'll give tertiary studies<br>a go did two cam two math two physics<br>botony and bio I did got my best Mark in<br>biology in seventh form so I thought I'd<br>probably become a<br>biologist memories of this time<br>University was quite different full year<br>courses not semesters like at with<br>summer school like we have now fees were<br>about $2,000 a year the previous year<br>that'd been 200 this was when we'd gone<br>from a sort of free education towards<br>paying a little bit and then obviously<br>most of the people who taught you had<br>handwritten lecture notes nothing was<br>printed there was no cesil or canvas if<br>you lost your lecture notes you're<br>pretty much trying to get them off a<br>friend um long lab hours so people did<br>36 hours of labs per course and you did<br>those in half of the semester it's very<br>appropriate we're here here today at the<br>end of the year all final grades were<br>posted by name and grade in the<br>cloysters right outside this lecture<br>theater so usually your friends knew how<br>you had done even before you did because<br>we were living in Mount Wellington you<br>have to travel and they were posted in<br>the cloes about a month before you got<br>the final grades by post really<br>interesting times now this is where my<br>career switched from biology to<br>chemistry obviously I'm interested in<br>cricket cricket practices were always in<br>the afternoons when the physics botony<br>and biology lectures<br>were maths and chemistry were in the<br>morning so I attended all those classes<br>net result GPA<br>3.8 obvious Professor material okay for<br>those of you who don't know the<br>University's GPA system that sits<br>between a C+ and a B minus in that sort<br>of grade range uh but the fact that my<br>friends had a whole year to ridic me<br>about this actually made me improve<br>across the next 2 years so having a bit<br>of cajoling from your friends is<br>sometime a positive influence here's our<br>cohort from this year really good bunch<br>of friends we'd socialize a lot and all<br>this sort of thing I'm in the back<br>row uh Joe gamma and Paul Harris who's<br>working in school of biological sciences<br>working with Margaret brimble<br>obviously um Peter rutage many of you<br>remember him he was the son of Stu<br>rutage who was is an associate professor<br>in organic chemistry here Peter's now a<br>professor of chemistry at Sydney<br>University uh he would always had an<br>opinion to offer even if you didn't ask<br>for it uh in this particular photo he's<br>asking me should he be in the front and<br>center at the center of the<br>photo um because that would make a<br>better photo obviously I'm happy to<br>oblige but at the same time thought he<br>might be better off on the row down um<br>so I'm giving him a nudge in the back<br>there and there are other victories to<br>celebrate such as securing the last<br>three beers at the graduation function<br>um so fun times but one of the good<br>things to come out of this was from my<br>BSC and what I think anyone who's doing<br>a BSC majoring in chemistry uh should<br>know from their time at the University<br>of Oakland is light these light matter<br>interactions so know how atoms come<br>together to form molecules via bonds<br>what type of bonds can exist in<br>molecules and how you can use different<br>types of magnetic radiation to<br>interrogate those molecules to learn<br>things about their<br>structure so for example you can use<br>microwaves to make molecules rotate this<br>is how you heat up water in a microwave<br>you can use infrared and uh visible<br>light um to basically cause vibrations<br>in molecules and from that you can get<br>information about the types of<br>functional groups or how the ensembles<br>of atoms exist in molecules you can use<br>VIs ible and ultraviolet light to excite<br>electrons from bonding orbitals into<br>anti-bonding orbitals and this is what<br>gives a lot of molecules their color<br>that I was interested in from my youth<br>you can also use x-rays to determine if<br>materials are crystalline or not or<br>amorphous um so there's a lot of<br>information and knowledge you can get<br>from studying how electromagnetic<br>radiation or waves of different<br>wavelength or frequency interact with<br>materials and obviously when you have<br>light interacting with an object it can<br>be absorbed some wavelengths from White<br>Light are taken out of that light some<br>of it can pass through the sample to the<br>other side some of it's bounced off a<br>sample other light is scattered in<br>different directions some of it's<br>refracted so these are all interactions<br>that you need to know and of course know<br>the relationship between energy<br>frequency and wavelength of these<br>different forms of electromagnetic<br>radiation the critical part is this<br>visible spectrum okay it's a range of<br>wavelengths which can be seen by the<br>human eye extends from about 380 NM up<br>to 750 NM so all those things I was<br>interested in my youth all related to<br>the visible spectrum and how light or<br>visible light interacted with objects so<br>if we look at these leaves obviously a<br>Lea growing on a tree is green as it<br>starts to get towards Autumn it starts<br>to change color going from eventually to<br>yellow and then some leaves go finally<br>to red and that's all to do these<br>different types of pigments that are<br>present in these molecules okay these<br>pigments absorb particular wavelengths<br>and it's these um absorptions which<br>actually give color so if we look at<br>chlorophylls down here which are a<br>special class of compound called porin<br>I'm going to talk a lot about them you<br>see they have this ring structure<br>sometimes they have a metal in the<br>middle sometimes they don't chlorophyll<br>the green pigment and plants does and<br>you see there's a lot of conjugation so<br>double bonds single bonds double bonds<br>single bonds double bonds single Bond<br>those that conjugation is important<br>because that lowers the energy<br>separation between the bonding and<br>anti-bonding orbitals enabling color at<br>visible wavelengths if you just have one<br>of these double bonds this absorbs in<br>the UV we can't see that so all of these<br>molecules which give rise to color all<br>have that<br>characteristic so what happens is when<br>the Leaf's on the tree you have these<br>all of these pigments contained within<br>the leaves um the chlorophyll there's a<br>lot of it when it's growing on the<br>and it's absorbing in the red part of<br>the spectrum it's absorbing in the blue<br>part of the spectrum we're seeing all<br>the wavelengths which aren't being<br>absorbed so we see a lot of the green<br>when you go to these other pigments<br>they're absorbing at different parts of<br>the uh absorption Spectrum so anthos<br>they were what was in your red wine that<br>you were drinking before you came in<br>here they absorb about 546 NM which is<br>in the green part of the spectrum we see<br>the wavelengths which aren't being<br>absorbed in this case red so by<br>understanding the structure structures<br>of molecules and their interactions with<br>light you can explain their color and a<br>lot of what we do in chemistry is this<br>spectroscopy where we're using<br>instruments to basically probe where<br>things absorb but this gets interesting<br>because eggshells also have similar<br>compounds to chlorophyll protop for 9<br>Billy verden so a dove egg it doesn't<br>have any of these pigments the blue<br>speckles that are on there are sorry the<br>blue color is coming from this compound<br>Biv verin the brown speckles are coming<br>from this compound<br>protopine okay now very interestingly<br>you see these compounds are very closely<br>related there's an enzyme in the body<br>which basically converts this to this by<br>oxidizing that Bond right there okay<br>also if you put a take those two<br>hydrogens off and you put an iron in the<br>middle you get heem heem is what<br>transports oxygen around in your red<br>blood cells<br>another<br>observation if you hydrogenate this Bond<br>you get this compound this is what makes<br>your poop brown okay in case you're<br>wondering why is your poop brown a<br>combination of this compound plus bile<br>gives the brown coloration so very<br>interesting so hemoglobin to protopine<br>to Billy verden it's a poop compound<br>fascinating so these were all things<br>that I thought about in my childhood and<br>through my BC I was able to answer we've<br>since gone on and done a lot of<br>experiments where we've used a technique<br>called ran spectroscopy with shining a<br>visible light laser in and trying to<br>quantify Billy verden and protoc Orrin<br>that are present in eggshells very<br>interestingly we did this experiment we<br>were able to get a piece of eggshell<br>from the upand mower which was the last<br>New Zealand mower species to go extinct<br>and using Raman Spectros op y we were<br>able to show it had these same<br>characteristic Peaks here as uh<br>compounds which as or eggshells which we<br>know contain Billy verden so we're able<br>to show that these mower eggs were<br>actually blue because they contained the<br>Billy ver and<br>pigment other people have since gone<br>back and looked at fossils okay how<br>stable are these compounds how long can<br>they last for you're going to be shocked<br>okay this is a 46 year old for 46 46<br>million year old<br>mosquito okay they've actually gone<br>through and actually found heem pigment<br>actually inside the mosquito where from<br>where it had bitten a mammal and had its<br>last meal so that's how stable these<br>heem compounds are that we just talked<br>about that are an egg shells okay here's<br>here's some dinosaur eggs now Matt I<br>know you love dinosaur eggs okay okay<br>these have been shown to contain Proto<br>and 9 and also Billy verden so this is<br>important because the type of compounds<br>uh catalysts we're now developing for a<br>lot of these reactions that perform<br>similar functions to he are based on<br>this porin structure like protopine 9 um<br>so very interesting and this shows this<br>demonstrates how stable these compounds<br>are of course color comes from other<br>mechanisms I talked about this color<br>that changes with angle or<br>iridescence if we look at poers<br>Shell what you find is if you do it<br>scanning electron microscopy image on<br>the crosssection of the shell you find<br>these calcium carbonate tiles okay<br>they're about 400 NM thick if you look<br>at peacock feathers the green part you<br>find these melanin rods about 140 nanm<br>in diameter if you look at the gemstone<br>opal which shows striking iridescence or<br>color change with angle you find these<br>200 nanom size Silica colloids so all of<br>these materials silica calcium carbonate<br>they're normally colorless yet here by<br>engineering this structure so they have<br>a sub micronized or periodicity similar<br>to visible light we actually can achieve<br>color and it's called structural color<br>so it's not the actual material itself<br>that's giving rise to the color it's how<br>that material is structured uh that's<br>responsible for it and of course we can<br>go through all of these things that we<br>see in our garden here's a stey blue<br>ladybird if you actually look at the<br>cuticle of this with an electron<br>microscope you find it's got these kiten<br>sheet kiten is a polymer of n acetal<br>glucosamine okay that's its structure<br>okay and the fact it has these uniformly<br>spaced sheets means it reflects light or<br>defract light at a particular wavelength<br>4 to four 92 NMM which is in the blue<br>region those golden spots on the monic<br>butterfly Crysis okay I've always<br>wondered what they were it's still kiten<br>but instead of having a uniform<br>thickness of the kiten sheets there's<br>actually a change in the periodicity as<br>you go deeper into the material this is<br>called a chirp multilayer and instead of<br>reflecting at a single wavelength like<br>this to a maximum it actually reflects<br>over a whole range of wavelengths and<br>this is also seen in this Beetle from<br>Costa Rica called Christina organs so<br>this black line here this shows the<br>reflectant spectrum of metallic gold you<br>can see it's absorbing strongly below 5<br>500 NM all the blue and violet<br>wavelengths are basically being absorbed<br>there's electronic transitions which<br>occur but it's reflecting all<br>wavelengths above 500 NM so reflecting<br>green orange uh yellow orange and red<br>the average of all those is a sort of<br>yellowy orange color what's interesting<br>with this particular beetle is that<br>these kiten<br>sheets actually contain these kiten<br>crystals which have a anti-h helical<br>pitch as you go up through the material<br>what happens is when white light comes<br>in certain wavelengths are bounce back<br>out but the light that's bounced back<br>out is also circularly polarized so<br>you've all been to a cinema and watched<br>a 3D movie you put on the glasses the<br>left lens enables left circularly<br>polarized light to go through the right<br>lens right circularly polarized light if<br>we look at the beetle using the left<br>lens it looks the same because the<br>Beetles reflected left circular<br>polarized light but the other lens the<br>light can't pass through the right cly<br>polarized lens so it's showing<br>remarkable features of nature that I<br>appreciated when I was young but only<br>recently have I been able to explain and<br>this is another Beetle uh moth found in<br>New Zealand called a golden pucia on its<br>it has these scales you think it might<br>be the same mechanism it's not there's<br>actually some Chevron or zigzag pattern<br>of kiten which is also giving a gold<br>coloration so a lot of my research is<br>about just looking at simple things and<br>trying to understand them you're all<br>familiar with what happens if you put<br>oil on water you can get iridescence<br>from there especially if you have a<br>bitan road black it's been raining and<br>there's a bit of oil floating on top<br>you'll see some really nice rainbow<br>patterns if you look at um pigeon<br>feathers you've got these black<br>melanosomes so they they're normally<br>black colored but what's giving the<br>color here is actually this layer of<br>keratin keratin is what your fingernails<br>are made from and this surrounds the m<br>melan melanosomes and the feather<br>barbules basically by changing the<br>thickness of the Keratin sheath we can<br>actually change what wavelengths are<br>reflected and we can actually model the<br>color of the so up near the head of the<br>pigeon that keratin sheet is about 500<br>nanm thick we can go through put the<br>numbers into this equation and this<br>tells us we should get reflection Maxima<br>in the red green and violet this is the<br>experimental result confirming that if<br>we go to further down near the shoulder<br>it's a thinner keratin sheath we get a<br>different reflected color it's<br>reflecting blue and red you both know<br>from your childhood days what happens if<br>you mix paints that are red and blue you<br>get purple and that's why the pigeon<br>feathers have that color Mark great to<br>see you mark Todd and I went to Primary<br>School Secondary School uh University<br>together we played squash every morning<br>as undergraduates fantastic to have you<br>here and of course recent researchers<br>found that T-Rex Velociraptors actually<br>probably had feathers colored<br>feathers um so very interesting most<br>dinosaur species were still scaly but<br>actually yeah this T-Rex was probably<br>feathered so very interesting and of<br>course we can go through and make<br>photonic crystals quite easily by<br>synthesizing colloids of about 200 nanm<br>in diameter crystallizing these and you<br>can see that they behave just like the<br>gemstone<br>opal there's a whole lot of things we<br>can do we can take materials like tio2<br>which is this pigment responsible for<br>the white pain on the walls and then<br>actually engineer this to have color so<br>this is T A2 or this material here just<br>by changing the structure and this<br>inverse opal material changing this<br>macropore diameter we can actually<br>produce a rainbow of color so structural<br>color rather than pigment-based and<br>these materials have fascinating<br>properties if you wet them with liquids<br>you can actually change the color they<br>reflect so here's the same tio2 inverse<br>opal in air filled with ethanol Doro<br>methane or Benzene so these solvents all<br>have increasing refractive index and you<br>can see how changing the solvent<br>refractive index is changing the<br>reflected<br>color of course nature does this better<br>than anyone so um this is the panther<br>chameleon okay normally they're living<br>in the trees they like to be green but<br>if they see a female or they see in a<br>male that they want to shake off they<br>change their color as a result and they<br>do that by In Their Skin there's a layer<br>of dermal aridor so made of guanine<br>crystals so guanine has a very high<br>refractive index so it's very good for<br>this application and so when they go<br>from green to Yellow they just change<br>the spacing of these guanine crystals<br>and as a result they change their color<br>sorry we got a video here I'll show what<br>the panther chameleon does it's been<br>sped up eight times compared to how<br>quickly it would do this<br>here and over a period of about 3<br>minutes it changes its color to<br>Yellow so this Dynamic iridescence is<br>really interesting we tried to reproduce<br>that we embedded silica colloids in a<br>stretchable polymer so in this case when<br>you stretch the polymer the colloids<br>will move closer together and this is<br>the result this is the type of stuff my<br>research students do here at the<br>University that is really fascinating so<br>we've been able to kind of replicate<br>what a chameleon skin<br>does of course course that was the BSC<br>now I started to think a bit further of<br>course I was still interested in playing<br>Cricket at this time obviously had some<br>success for the University Club in the<br>final year of my PhD actually but<br>actually my Cricket<br>days created another mystery and you<br>guys have probably thought about it the<br>same way when you mow the grass that<br>Aroma what is<br>it okay it's actually this compound<br>called three hex enal down here okay but<br>there's a whole lot of other compounds<br>methanol and aldah which are present<br>when you inhale the vapors that come<br>once you uh cut grass and this really<br>influenced my PhD topic this these<br>alcohols aldah tides and so I did a PhD<br>actually on Industrial formaly<br>manufacturer so formaly is one of the<br>world's most important industrial<br>chemicals top 25 chemical it's used to<br>make the resins that go into particle<br>boards and a range of other chemicals<br>and cosmetic products process involves<br>passing methanol here mixing it with Air<br>heating it up adding some steam passing<br>it through a bit of silver Catalyst<br>here collecting the products and then<br>collecting the for Malahide product here<br>the problem with this process is you can<br>make formaly several ways but you can<br>also get a lot of other products carbon<br>dioxide formic acid carbon monoxide um<br>the formic acid is particularly bad if<br>you're trying to make synthetic resins<br>so producing formaly with a minimum<br>amount of formic acid uh is a real<br>Challenge and obviously we need to<br>understand what the catalyst is doing<br>here so normally if you're trying to<br>convert methano from aldah there'll be a<br>big energy barrier you need to go over<br>in order to get to your product okay a<br>catalyst provides a lower energy Pathway<br>to enable you to do that and that's what<br>the silver catalyst is doing in this<br>particular reaction<br>here's what the actual reactor looks<br>like it's about 3 m wide uh it's about<br>an inch thick of this granular silver<br>Catalyst and it's actually hot okay<br>you're running at 650 to 700° C okay<br>this is what the plant looks like so I<br>worked at with hexion New Zealand it was<br>ICI New Zealand at that time in Mount<br>monoi not a bad place to go every month<br>or so to spend a bit of time but this is<br>what the looks like imagine something<br>the size of a Rugby<br>field okay pretty<br>massive PhD project reproduce this in<br>the lab take something that's this big<br>industrial process and then actually<br>reproduce that onto something about the<br>size of this table here basically<br>requires retraining as a chemical<br>engineer and then screen Catalyst from<br>different suppliers to see which gives<br>the best performance so for those of you<br>involved in research currently if you<br>want to do research and get a big sum of<br>money you apply to an organization<br>called the ministry of business<br>Innovation employment for an Endeavor<br>program which is worth about $10 million<br>usually you'd have like five or 10<br>people involved in it that's the amount<br>of effort required to actually get this<br>project done kind of why my PhD took<br>eight years uh in case anyone's<br>wondering but basically from industry<br>they had gone through and they had<br>screened catalysts from different<br>suppliers and what you see is that some<br>of these catalysts are granular with<br>boundaries in between the grains these<br>turn out to be good for making form<br>alahh without formic acid Catalyst B<br>which has mirrorlike facet surfaces this<br>turned out to be crap so understanding<br>why a good Catalyst worked well was the<br>real challenge of this so here's the<br>Prototype I ended up building that<br>simulated the industrial reactor it took<br>about 5 years to optimize the end<br>results down here is that in the reactor<br>you're passing methanol water and oxygen<br>through the bed of silver Catalyst and<br>you're looking to see how much form<br>alahh are you getting out that's<br>ultimately what's driving this so this<br>is the industrial process this is what<br>we got as percentage yields it's pretty<br>decent and I was I think out of all the<br>research I've ever done I've had more Su<br>more publicity with the recent stuff<br>nothing compares to that in terms of it<br>a personal achievement that's my feeling<br>about it so obviously you can study how<br>temperature affects things like the<br>conversion of methanol and the formation<br>of the F fromal but your catalyst is<br>also changing during reaction it starts<br>off looking like that through reaction<br>you start seeing all these pin holes<br>appearing so this indicates that during<br>the process oxygen is somehow in the<br>bulk of your silver reacting with<br>hydrogen then blowing out as Steam<br>creating a lot of debris you can see<br>little pieces of debris around here and<br>this is something people forget about<br>that your catalyst is in a dynamic state<br>of change it's not just a fix so using<br>insitu ran spectroscopy at reaction<br>temperatures we were able to show that<br>the selectivity of the Catalyst to form<br>Malahide or the other products was<br>actually controlled by the types of<br>oxygen species present on the surface<br>and these have become highly cited uh<br>works in the field of<br>catalysis so obviously got out of the<br>PHD in 2004 you know eight or ninee<br>Journey you're kind of happy for that<br>and I still had that question Academia<br>or Cricket um you might recognize Jim<br>Metson here he's got a mustache he had a<br>mustache for the most of the time I knew<br>him um so I applied for a New Zealand<br>Science and Technology postdoctoral<br>Fellowship uh and they were offering 25<br>um fellowships that year my application<br>ranked<br>26th okay if I hadn't got that funding<br>at that time I wouldn't be here right<br>now fortunately one person declined and<br>that meant I was given the 25th<br>Fellowship that year so yeah I mean I<br>look back on that as a pivotal moment<br>and that's led to my current work in<br>nanot technology um CU that's where what<br>I started doing during my fellowship so<br>we need to talk a little bit about scale<br>I mean obviously you all know one meter<br>uh that's 10 9 NM okay you know a millim<br>okay that's 10 6 or 1 1 million nanom<br>okay I was talking about those photonics<br>crystals and visible light so they're<br>operating in that region between 100 and<br>1,000 nanom when we're talking about<br>nanomaterials we're talking about<br>materials with Dimensions less than 100<br>nanom some of the materials I'm working<br>on now were less than 1 nanometer this<br>is<br>Tiny okay but nanotechnology is all<br>around us and it's been around us for a<br>long time I've already talked about bulk<br>gold how it absorbs light below 500 NM<br>but reflects all those longer<br>wavelengths like green yellow orange and<br>red so we see it as that sort of pale<br>yellow color lustrous okay but if we<br>shrink gold down to small Dimensions its<br>colors and properties change so like a 5<br>nanom spherical gold nanoparticle in<br>solution will look red so it's absorbing<br>about 520 530 NM that's in the green<br>part of the spectrum and we're seeing<br>the wavelengths which aren't being<br>absorbed and also the color that's<br>reflected or absorbed um actually<br>depends on the shape of the nanop<br>particles what's interesting is gold<br>nanoparticles colloidal gold has<br>actually been used in stained glass<br>windows uh for hundreds of years so the<br>red color you can see there all of<br>that's coming from gold nanop particles<br>actually embedded in the<br>glass and of course properties change<br>when you shrink down even smaller a<br>feature of these small clusters which<br>make contain about 50 gold atoms is that<br>they show fluoresence fluoresence is a<br>process because they're more like<br>molecules than they are a bulk metal so<br>in molecules you if we have bonding and<br>anti-bonding orbitals you can excite<br>electrons from lowlevel orbitals into<br>high level orbitals they shake off a bit<br>of energy and then emit light at longer<br>wavelength this is typical for these<br>porine compounds I'm talk I was talking<br>about<br>earlier but we can go through and make<br>these very small gold<br>clusters okay and then study their<br>fluorescence properties so if we make<br>them just 1.7 NM in size this one<br>absorbs at uh 560 and emits red light so<br>if you shine visible light at 560 NM on<br>it it if you look at it it'll look red<br>this other one's slightly smaller if<br>you're excited at under UV wav of 320 NM<br>it will flues in the blue okay it's an<br>interesting feature<br>we connected this to a peptide sequence<br>here and this peptide sequence targets<br>cell nuclei so we can put these small<br>gold nanoclusters inside cell nuclei<br>shine light at those wavelengths where<br>they absorb light and then look at their<br>fluorescence so those red and blue<br>patches you can see there are where<br>we've put these gold nanoclusters inside<br>nuclei once you shrink gold down to<br>small Dimensions it can also Drive Catal<br>Catal itic reaction so there's an enzyme<br>called horseradish peroxidase okay so<br>peroxides in the body these aren't good<br>for you they can cause uh damage to free<br>radicals or they can cause damage to<br>biological tissues lipids uh not good<br>for your health so enzymes such as<br>horseradish<br>peroxidase um are important and these<br>gold nanoclusters have properties<br>similar to that they can drive the same<br>chemical reactions and destroy peroxides<br>we can also make use these for detecting<br>Mercury so here's an example where we<br>had carbon Quantum dots these don't<br>interact with Mercury but fluores in the<br>blue and gold nanoclusters which um<br>absorb UV light and flues in the red but<br>gold interacts with Mercury ions so we<br>what we can do is we can have these two<br>types of um quantum dot in our system<br>shine UV light on it if Mercury is<br>present then the fluoresence of the gold<br>is selectively suppressed as a result we<br>can see a visual color change as we<br>increase the concentration of mercury so<br>we've got a way of detecting heavy<br>metals and water M based on the<br>fluoresence of<br>materials the rest of my talk is going<br>to be about our current work obviously<br>Global warming's becoming a big big<br>issue I was born in 1972 so was Mark I<br>think May and June respectively um in<br>our lifetimes the population of humans<br>on the planet has doubled again my<br>parents' lifetime it's tripled since<br>their parents was born it's quadrupled<br>okay crazy numbers the current<br>population growth ratees about 228,000<br>extra people every day or the population<br>of New Zealand in 20 days is pumped<br>somewhere on the planet uh crazy stuff<br>and in the Asia Pacific region where we<br>live most of our energy is currently<br>coming from fossil fuels not good we all<br>know what this means CO2 is going into<br>the atmosphere causing global warming<br>and temperatures aren't changing<br>uniformly over the planet the Arctic<br>much hotter than other regions so it's<br>predicted by as early as 2030 that the<br>Arctic may be ice free in summer where<br>there'll only be a little bit of ice<br>clinging to the top of Greenland kind of<br>scary this was a painting done in 1899<br>where some a group of artists was asked<br>asked what will the world look like in<br>the year 2000 what will people be doing<br>in the year 2000 you know quite a long<br>time ago now this is it people are<br>living<br>underwater fishing for seagulls this<br>could be us if Global warming's not<br>combed so how can we reduce global<br>warming okay those familiar with the MCU<br>Universe Thanos went around collected<br>these Infinity Stones forged a GL<br>gauntlet<br>clicked his fingers straight away half<br>of the people everywhere gone Earth<br>other planets<br>gone not a bad option actually as as as<br>as someone who's interested in pretty<br>Stones I kind of wonder what these<br>Infinity Stones are made from and if I<br>could make them I wonder if I could have<br>got to Professor<br>earlier Professor just by clicking my<br>fingers okay but another Alterna of<br>another way we might get there is<br>through embracing Renewables um and this<br>is really where a lot of my current<br>research is at so we're looking at ways<br>we can use renewable energy Wind Farm<br>solar um we can store that electricity<br>shortterm in batteries but we need much<br>higher energy density batteries than<br>what we're currently making or we can<br>feed that in electricity into an<br>electrolyzer make split water into<br>hydrogen and oxygen then use that<br>hydrogen as a fuel uh using a fuel cell<br>to convert the hydrogen back to<br>electricity for New Zealand how can we<br>reduce our emissions I think the easiest<br>way is through the transportation sector<br>uh we're about 19% of our emissions are<br>currently coming from uh the transport<br>so cars burning Octane and Diesel um<br>so<br>therefore if we look at the<br>transportation sector what are our<br>options we've got battery electric<br>vehicles or fuel cell vehicles was<br>powered by hydrogen so there's some<br>people in the audience doing some great<br>work around electric vehicles Greg and<br>cther from Tron Greg where are you great<br>so Greg's driven the length of the<br>country showing that our current<br>electric vehicle recharging<br>infrastructure can enable that uh really<br>fantastic stuff for heavier Vehicles<br>obviously uh range becomes an issue and<br>that's where hydrogen because of the<br>fast refueling uh is expected to play a<br>more important role so Greg and<br>Catherine doing a great job great to<br>have you here tonight<br>Greg another alternative is this form of<br>Transport I mean obviously with grass we<br>already have the refueling<br>infrastructure required to sustain it um<br>but obviously Greg with his electric<br>vehicle is interested in acceleration<br>from standstill I think this won't<br>appeal to you<br>Greg one of the problems with moving to<br>a green hydrogen the key technologies<br>that we need to use uh we talked about<br>it rechargeable batteries those<br>electrolyzers which make hydrogen the<br>fuel cells which convert hydrogen back<br>into electricity currently they all use<br>heavy metals so those Metals there<br>particularly platinum and aridium<br>they're really good for driving a lot of<br>these reactions<br>needed so how can we replace these<br>precious metals with lowc cost<br>Alternatives in particular that first<br>row of trans transition metal elements<br>there how can we make catalysts from<br>those which do the same function as<br>these precious<br>metals okay in medieval times people<br>were talking about the philosopher stone<br>this was a magic material it might have<br>been a stone might have been a powder<br>people don't really know a tincture um<br>but this had the property of being able<br>to convert ordinary metals based Metals<br>into precious metals like gold and<br>silver okay when I was an undergraduate<br>the lab kind of looked like that and but<br>in the modern day environment obviously<br>a lot of health and safety violations<br>going on there but I think actually<br>nanotechnology is the philosopher stone<br>it enables us to take materials which<br>are common and do fancy things with them<br>so with Greek support we're developing<br>this new type of rechargeable battery<br>called a zinc air battery why are we<br>interested in it this is your normal<br>lithium ion battery in terms of its<br>energy density about 265 W hours per kg<br>these metal air batteries trying to<br>develop this is their sort of um<br>specific energy density so you can see<br>it's about four times High a zinc air<br>battery can store has four times as much<br>energy density as a lithium ion which is<br>currently used in electric vehicles and<br>portable electronic<br>devices so how do this how does the zinc<br>air battery work pretty simple during<br>the discharge of the battery when you're<br>using the electricity zinc's dissolving<br>from that plate going into the alkaline<br>electrolyte Oxygen's going from Air into<br>this so these are like air breathing<br>batteries they're sucking in oxygen and<br>this is part of the thing electrons are<br>going via the circuit in this direction<br>and that's where you can have your<br>device that'll be powered by this<br>battery during the<br>recharge then what happens is the zinc<br>plates again onto that metal plate there<br>and actually oxygen comes out of the<br>battery so what we need to do is develop<br>Catalyst for the oxygen reduction<br>reaction which is what heem in your<br>blood actually does when it's<br>transporting oxygen around your body<br>it's actually reducing oxygen and then<br>on the iron site and carrying that<br>around and obviously we need a catalyst<br>which can do both to make this a<br>rechargeable<br>battery and we're taking inspiration<br>from so traditionally with nanocatalysis<br>people have been using nanop particles<br>these aren't very good because only the<br>surface atoms of these materials<br>actually participates in the catalysis<br>okay it wastes a lot of the metal we're<br>interested in downsizing actually making<br>a nitrogen doped carbon support with<br>isolated metal atoms sitting on that<br>surface so every one of those isolated<br>metal atoms here can actually<br>participate in a catalytic reaction so<br>great Energy Efficiency and atom<br>utilization efficiency so obviously we<br>want to have a metal we know Iron which<br>is in hemoglobin can drive the oxygen<br>reduction<br>reaction and so we're making these metal<br>single atom Catalyst to mimic what<br>hemoglobin and some other enzymes do we<br>can do computational screening to show<br>what will be the best metals if we<br>coordinate them by nitrogen or<br>coordinate them by three nitrogens and a<br>phosphorus so but what we find is that<br>if we have this simple arrangement I was<br>talking about like he where you have<br>four nitrogen atoms coordinated to the<br>metal then the best Catalyst for the the<br>oxygen reduction reaction turns out to<br>be ion the best catalyst for the oxygen<br>Evolution reaction turns out to be<br>Cobalt first row transition metals<br>potentially offering a replacement to<br>platinum and<br>aridium we can go through and make them<br>and do some Advanced<br>characterization and then we can test<br>their performance in a battery and what<br>you find is that these metal single atom<br>catalysts if you apply them in a battery<br>and look at the uh energy density of the<br>um battery that you make using these C<br>Catalyst it's actually much better than<br>using a catalyst which was 20 we%<br>platinum on carbon so Platinum nanop<br>particles poor utilization of platinum<br>using these single atom catalysts which<br>are modeled on he is actually the best<br>way to go so this demonstrated we could<br>use make a primary battery which just<br>gives out electricity and in this next<br>work we demonstrated that by the<br>addition of some other component we<br>could actually produce a fully re<br>chargeable zinc air battery with<br>performance far outperforming a catalyst<br>based on the precious metal uh<br>Alternatives obviously this is our plan<br>over the next few years our current lab<br>batteries look like that even though<br>we've got great catalst they're very<br>Frankenstein like with a lot of bolts<br>and nuts um we really want to move<br>through this commercialization phase<br>make things the size of an A4 sheet<br>stack these together into modular<br>systems or make Flex one of the<br>advantages of these zinc air batteries<br>is they enable us to make flexible<br>batteries which we can use in wearable<br>electronics and at serendipitous<br>Discovery we found that if we have Mel<br>coordinated by two oxygens and two<br>nitrogens instead of four nitrogens we<br>can electrochemically produce hydrogen<br>peroxide so hydrogen peroxide is an<br>important chemical it's used for<br>sterilization and other purposes during<br>covid-19 production of hydrogen peroxide<br>increased 3 times everyone's trying to<br>sterilize surfaces so we're showing that<br>using metal single atom Catalyst and by<br>varying the coordination around the<br>metal atom we can actually get um the<br>product we want in this case hydrogen<br>peroxide of course sustainable Aviation<br>fuels is a big one are we going to be<br>able to do long haul travel from New<br>Zealand in future currently I know a New<br>Zealand's looking at hydrogen which will<br>maybe get us to Australia problem is<br>with hydrogen it's hard to store in and<br>large quantities for Long Haul flights<br>so really we're looking at ways we can<br>actually make sustainable Aviation fuels<br>they typically have a carbon number with<br>about eight carbon atoms through to 16<br>carbon atoms so reasonably small<br>hydrocarbons recently we found out that<br>we can come up with a way of using Focus<br>sunlight and a ruthenium Cobalt single<br>atom catalyst so Cobalt nanoparticles<br>with ruthenium atoms embedded in it we<br>can actually produce these liquid fuels<br>that we need that uh could be used as<br>part of sustainable Aviation fuels so<br>this is showing the value of metal<br>single atom catalysts uh in supporting a<br>renewable energy future I'm quite<br>excited about this work and where it's<br>going next so if I'm to talk about my<br>career Jeff I know you love<br>Janus so I thought I'd mention it here<br>this shows my research productivity as a<br>function of time obviously up I got out<br>of a PhD in 2004 was on these fixed term<br>contracts for a while eventually got<br>tenure at the age of 40 at<br>2012 this is my research productivity<br>since so this is number of Publications<br>per year versus citations on those um<br>I'm really proud of where things have<br>gone over time this is atypical I think<br>for someone who become professor at this<br>University where normally they'd have a<br>fixed number of Publications over an<br>extended period um so I'm much happier<br>to be at this part of my career than<br>perhaps at the front end and obviously<br>in that first part I was dabbling<br>between professional Cricket or Academia<br>the body's too old to even think about<br>that now so but the skills I learned<br>before I got tenure have really<br>benefited me in the back end of my<br>career and continue to do<br>so obviously plenty of people to thank<br>um students I mean I love teaching<br>undergraduate students one of the great<br>Passion and joys uh and responsibilities<br>as being a University academic the<br>students love these mobile spaces where<br>they can move discs around they probably<br>thought they'd get a bit of Mark by<br>putting it in the shape of a<br>g I was okay with it and obviously a<br>screenshot from some experiments we used<br>to do in chem 340 where we got this<br>handheld xrf analyzer which enables us<br>to go through and look at the chemical<br>composition of different coins so a lot<br>of you might be surprised the and $2<br>coin don't contain any gold they look<br>golden but actually if you look at their<br>composition uh they're mostly copper<br>with a little bit of nickel and<br>manganese similarly copper you know is<br>that red color there if you look at a<br>10cent piece then it's mostly copper as<br>you'd expect but if you look at the 50<br>cent piece it contains a lot of copper<br>it's still<br>41% copper yet it's colorless it doesn't<br>have the normal color you'd associate<br>with with copper so again showing how<br>alloying of metals together can<br>introduce new functions so my research<br>at the university has been supported by<br>a huge number of technicians over a long<br>period and often they get neglected when<br>people are giving thanks for the<br>contribution so I mention them here one<br>of the good things about traveling and<br>being internationally involved in<br>research I've now published with over<br>1100<br>Coors um to me this is a win you know<br>the more scientists can get out and<br>collaborate and publish with others the<br>more likely you are to do something<br>useful obviously plenty of Supervisors<br>and mentors along the way top row then<br>there's other people you just like to<br>see around campus laori<br>Malon Bob Anderson Bob I mentioned you<br>earlier that's why I haven't got your<br>photo here uh bromin Smith is no longer<br>with us but my time in food science she<br>was a real good Mentor David Williams<br>and Jeff Jamerson I mean critical<br>Junctions of my career they've stepped<br>up when there's nothing for them to get<br>out of it but have offered help and<br>advice and of course occasionally you<br>know I'm a bit of a live wire you need<br>people to rain you in and kther and<br>Gordon have done that from time to time<br>and just say maybe think about doing<br>things in other ways so it's important<br>that I acknowledge them<br>also obviously family's a big part of<br>anything and uh one of the great joys of<br>actually you know living I think is<br>having good family and having fun with<br>them so obviously my parents Jane and<br>Matthew uh my dog Pepe who was with me<br>right through PhD<br>studies yeah but above all my wife yeah<br>dong<br>sh she just inspires and amazes me every<br>day yeah just like yeah I I'm really<br>blessed to have you in my life as my<br>wife so thank you mate yeah<br>and thank you all for being here today<br>it's been special for me and your<br>presence has made it so so thank you<br>very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
