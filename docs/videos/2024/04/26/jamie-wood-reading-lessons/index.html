accurate.</p><p>um so I think what I sort of started<br>with over the last few years I've got<br>increasingly interested in Reading um<br>and I've come to realize that um over<br>the course of my career as I've been<br>teaching people to read at University<br>one of the problems that I um faced is<br>that I've forgotten what it's like to<br>learn to read um I've realized that<br>through um as my my daughter is learning<br>to read at the moment seeing her like as<br>a 5-year-old trying to do it but also as<br>our students are transitioning to come<br>to University that we're trying to teach<br>them to read in specific ways and I've<br>forgotten how I learned to do that which<br>creates a um a real barrier I think to<br>to to getting them to read how we want<br>so today I'm going to share some of what<br>I've learned um about what it was like<br>to go to school in Antiquity in late<br>Antiquity the end of the ancient world<br>and a little bit about what it's like to<br>try and read online now if you're a<br>student I wouldn't say that there's you<br>know I wouldn't say there's an argument<br>in this paper it's just some stuff that<br>I think is interesting in a sort of<br>structure and I think that's the sort of<br>privilege of um giving an inaugural you<br>can do what you want um within reason um<br>so I'm going to come back to these two<br>images one is of a Christian Saint being<br>scourged for reading classical<br>literature on that side and some<br>hedgehogs as we move through the through<br>the talk um as I was Was preparing the<br>talk um I thought well what I'll do is<br>I'll look back at like when I started<br>teaching which is now about 20 20 years<br>ago started teaching at University about<br>20 years ago on a course called the rise<br>of Christianity um at the University of<br>Manchester um and I remember how we we<br>taught that it was led by uh someone<br>called Kate Cooper who's now a professor<br>at Royal Holloway in London um and<br>really what the way in which we did it<br>was read one one page of text every week<br>we poured over this with these first<br>year students trying to teach them how<br>to engage with this this very in a very<br>detailed way with the<br>text I also remembered how terrifying it<br>was to to be in front of just 10 15 if<br>they all turned up maybe 20<br>undergraduate students how how like<br>scary that actually that actually was at<br>the time and<br>how really crap I was at it to begin<br>with and how it took me a long time to<br>kind of figure out um how to how to kind<br>of improve get a bit<br>better and as I reflected I thought well<br>actually my pedagogy hasn't really<br>developed that much since then really<br>what I still do is read small blocks of<br>texts together with students sometimes<br>it's online sometimes it's in person and<br>then try to come to some sort of<br>understanding of it<br>together<br>um so in the spirit of that reading<br>things together there are a number of<br>there's quite a lot of text on some of<br>the slides I'm not expecting you to read<br>it but you can read it if you drift off<br>and get bored of listening to me and<br>there are some bits of those texts that<br>I really want to try and focus<br>on the other thing I just mentioned<br>before that my daughter is learning to<br>read at the moment my favorite book over<br>the last couple of years has been this<br>book The Knight who wouldn't fight it's<br>a story about a knight called Leo who<br>really loves reading but his parents<br>really want him to love<br>fighting so they they buy him a new<br>shield and sword and send him off on a<br>quest to defeat a dragon on the journey<br>to defeat the dragon he doesn't defeat<br>the other monsters that he meets the<br>troll the Griffin and the dragon<br>eventually he doesn't defeat them by<br>fighting them he defeats them by reading<br>them stories defeats them by it's a it's<br>a book about the power of reading and<br>for me that's quite quite powerful and I<br>think it speaks to anyone who stayed at<br>University to do Humanities it's about<br>that tension it's about staying at Uni<br>and doing reading rather than going to<br>the real world which is what I've<br>endeavored to do for the<br>last 30 years nearly now I guess I'm<br>going to give do a bit of context to lay<br>out what education was like in at the<br>end of the Roman world and the start of<br>the Middle Ages I'm going to introduce a<br>couple of the figures that I'm going to<br>going to talk about a man called<br>libanius and a man called Augustine and<br>then at the end I'm going to get to my<br>old friend Isidor who I did my PhD on<br>many years<br>ago in dispers with that I'm going to<br>talk a bit about some of the work I've<br>done on digital reading um and I'm going<br>to really I think if I have an argument<br>it's about the power of reading together<br>um something that we can do obviously in<br>in person physically in the same space<br>digitally just the only map of the<br>presentation the three people that I'm<br>going to talk about in a bit of detail<br>in my abstract I talked about<br>introducing you to some little known<br>teachers I think aart from possibly one<br>or two people in the room nobody will<br>have heard of this guy called libanius<br>who is a teacher of rhetoric somebody<br>who teaches how to give speeches in the<br>city of Antioch in the Eastern Roman<br>Empire um at the end of the 4th Century<br>his contemporary Augustine St Augustine<br>who many people will have heard of and<br>may have gone to a school named after um<br>for example um is is his rough<br>contemporary and I'm going to talk about<br>him as somebody who who gives a story<br>about his life<br>um his career really that that is that<br>that develops through this process of<br>reading in lots of different<br>ways and then I'm going to end by<br>talking about Isidor um who's a bishop<br>in the south of uh what's now Spain in<br>the early 7th Century so two people from<br>the late 4th Century one guy from the<br>early 7th<br>Century so who is<br>libanus so as I said he's from Antioch<br>he's from a quite an elite background<br>he's somebody who goes to be educated in<br>the city of Athens becomes a teacher in<br>Constantinople and then goes back to his<br>hometown of Antioch where he becomes a<br>teacher of rhetoric as I<br>said he's really quite well connected<br>and he's so such a kind of prominent<br>figure within Antioch antiochian society<br>that he's entrusted with delivering<br>speeches for example when a new emperor<br>when an emperor comes to the city a<br>speech of Welcome would be given and and<br>leenus would was entrusted with that on<br>a number of<br>occasions why he's interesting to think<br>about in terms of education is that lots<br>of his Works survive so over 60 of his<br>speeches<br>survive many of which talk about his<br>approach to<br>teaching um over, 1500 of his letters<br>survive again many of which are about<br>his students um written to the parents<br>of the students to tell them how the<br>kids are doing um trying to get jobs for<br>his students sucking up to his ex-<br>students to try and get make connections<br>so when when I've been using him to<br>teach I've used him as a means of giving<br>kind of really textured view of what a<br>classroom might have been like what a<br>school might have been like what it was<br>like to teach and learn in late<br>Antiquity he's a fascinating<br>figure um and he's a pagan so we need to<br>bear that in mind because this is the<br>period in which Christianity is is<br>emerging to the four during the lifetime<br>of Augustine Christianity becomes um the<br>the religion of the Roman<br>Empire it's also the period in which all<br>these groups of people that we used to<br>call barbarians but now we don't<br>generally call barbarians but it's much<br>easier to call them barbarians so I'm<br>going to do that lots of different<br>people like the Visigoths the Franks the<br>Anglo-Saxons are all moving into what<br>used to be the Western Roman Empire<br>and we used to think that they all<br>smashed it up but now we think that they<br>just kind of fiddled around with it a<br>little bit and much of it stayed the<br>same anyway that's not really important<br>but we're in this transitional<br>moment Christianity is<br>emerging um as the powerful force um<br>we've got these new Barbarian kingdoms<br>emerging and here we get St Jerome the<br>dream of St Jerome in a letter to a<br>young young woman called UST stokum<br>Jerome reports having a dream a fever<br>dream really in which he's um dragged<br>before<br>Christ here in in a tribunal so Christ<br>acting as a judge and um Christ asks who<br>are you and Jerome says I'm a<br>Christian and Christ says no you're not<br>a Christian you're a<br>ciceronian which means he's accusing him<br>of being much more wedded to classical<br>literature to the literature of the<br>classical past to Cicero the kind of<br>emblematic Latin writer you like him<br>much more than you like Christianity and<br>he then has um Jerome scourged until he<br>he promises never I'll never touch that<br>stuff again I'll never have anything to<br>do with this again instead I will be a<br>pure Christian so it's obviously a<br>highly kind of crafted story about kind<br>of<br>conversion through<br>Reading um it's it's a story about what<br>books we accept what texts do we accept<br>and what texts don't we accept we don't<br>like that Pagan stuff anymore don't like<br>that Roman stuff this gets us to to<br>Augustine who's somebody who also had a<br>problem a bit of a bit of a habit with<br>um he's born he's a North African he's<br>born in a small city um from a mid sort<br>of a middling level family and manages<br>to through his education to move through<br>the Roman educational system and kind of<br>make<br>good um he's he's somebody who's in a<br>sort of undecided Camp religiously he<br>ends up being a Christian obviously ends<br>up being a saint but through his his his<br>life um in a book that he wrote after<br>he'd become a bishop called the<br>confessions he tells a story of his kind<br>of gradual conversion to Christianity<br>and this story is one very much of<br>reading reading as being part of the<br>process of becoming a true<br>Christian so he's sort of spiritual<br>autobiography and this text really<br>resonates with people of the time it<br>very rapidly becomes a bestseller PE<br>bestseller when everything's being<br>copied by hand um but people are reading<br>it very soon afterwards and it's<br>extremely popular and I the second<br>course I ever taught at Manchester with<br>someone called Conrad Liza who's now um<br>uh works at Oxford University um was<br>essentially a close reading of the<br>confessions there were 12 weeks of the<br>course and happily there are 12 books of<br>the confessions so we simply read a book<br>A Week stopping actually at book 10<br>because in book 11 and 12 it goes a bit<br>crazy um and that was just a bit<br>difficult so that gave us enough time to<br>kind of fit everything in and that<br>really taught me again about that the<br>value of kind of close reading the value<br>of reading with somebody who knows a<br>text really well and can guide you<br>through it was um yeah it was amazing<br>and also that can engage you with<br>something that's sensibly really really<br>esoteric this kind of spiritual<br>autobiography okay so that's giving you<br>Augustine and lanius I'm now going to do<br>a little bit of um introduction to Roman<br>education so Roman education is really<br>Romans don't<br>really<br>value you know business studies isn't<br>that important or important at all um<br>technical disciplines aren't where it's<br>at it's not about The Cutting Edge of<br>lab-based subjects Romans are all about<br>language at the elite level of Education<br>you can see this in the sort of exercise<br>School exercises that's that survive<br>from um Antiquity in in thousands and<br>thousands of um Papyrus fragments for<br>example um and you can we can see it in<br>in narrative sources as well sources<br>where people talk about<br>education here we've got an extract from<br>a second century biography of um sort of<br>four fifth century BC Greek figure in<br>which this this biography is saying<br>biography is saying this guy called<br>alcibiades who's a um Greek General and<br>Statesman from Athens giving an account<br>of his uh childhood he says he visited a<br>teacher and asked for a book of homer so<br>Homer the kind of foundational book of<br>Greek literature or maybe of all<br>literature um he said he didn't have any<br>any any homer so alides punched him and<br>left but when another teacher said that<br>he had a copy of homer which he had<br>corrected himself alidi said why are you<br>bothering to teach the alphabet when<br>you're good enough to correct Homer why<br>aren't you teaching young men this this<br>illustrates that that those the the<br>importance of language<br>the violence of the school room and I<br>think one of the things that attracted<br>me to this like late late antique<br>education was its violent nature I don't<br>know if it was some kind of vicarious<br>sort of like oh you know you know it's<br>really frustrating it's not working you<br>know they had one way of resolving it<br>which was violently um it talks about<br>the classics that the importance of<br>engaging with these classic texts like<br>Homer and it's really elitist is isn't<br>it you shouldn't be bothering this<br>piffling business of teaching people to<br>the nuts and bolts of reading what you<br>should be doing is engaging them with<br>this higher order learning so they're<br>elitist just like we<br>are<br>um and part part of that was the point<br>of Education of that higher order<br>learning was to train young men Elite<br>young men a very small group of them to<br>rule to imbue them with certain<br>characteristics certain learning that<br>were enable them to demonstrate that<br>they belonged in the elite class that<br>was running the<br>Empire<br>to to to train them in rhetoric so to<br>put it bluntly so they could do what<br>they wanted so they could get other<br>people to do what they wanted it was<br>about learning how to Once you'd<br>mastered the the grammar the basics of<br>language it was about learning how to<br>manipulate it in order to to to make the<br>world as you wanted it for yourself that<br>very elite<br>level so Romans also had just like we do<br>they have un they had University towns<br>and campuses places like Alexandria had<br>these quite very large complexes that<br>were devoted to this higher order<br>learning they had lecture theaters that<br>don't look that dissimilar to the sort<br>of lecture theaters that um that we have<br>to many of us have to teach in um that<br>probably are warmer because they're in<br>Alexandria than the ones that we have to<br>teach in and in which the AV probably<br>um and you can see that the ways the way<br>in which this is laid out from the plan<br>you can see the standardized the more or<br>less standardized layout um the fact<br>that it's next to the bath complex and<br>the theater it's suggesting that there's<br>some level of planning going on this is<br>like a Civic project for some of these<br>cities like Alexandria Athens Bordeaux<br>Beirut lots of different places<br>is so they become a kind of source of<br>cities they also had things like tuition<br>fees um so you see lots of uh reflected<br>in some of the sources you see an<br>anxiety from teachers about whether the<br>students parents are ever going to pay<br>them up or students writing letters to<br>their fathers asking them to send the<br>fees so that they can pay they can pay<br>the<br>teacher they have report cards that are<br>sent well what are the equivalent of<br>report cards that are sent from the<br>teachers to the parents this is one from<br>libanius to a man called acacius and it<br>says that when when you sent your son to<br>us you said that he was basically UNR he<br>was unruly he'd be much better at<br>fighting than he could ever be at<br>learning libania says to him but I've<br>solve that problem for<br>you I've taught him how to Value peace<br>much more than to value the use of his<br>fists there are hundreds of these<br>letters in libanus his collection and um<br>and from other collections too there's<br>this strong idea that the the teacher is<br>responsible for forming these young men<br>into an image of their<br>father and that the teacher is at the<br>same time it's all he's a rhetorician<br>he's he's trying to cultivate a<br>relationship with the father to show to<br>to show that he's done a good job to<br>generate more business for the future<br>so it's all about reputation as well so<br>some I think some of this resonates with<br>how um teaching Works nowadays whether<br>in schools or<br>universities right I'm now going to talk<br>briefly about some of the stuff I've<br>done in relation to to digital reading<br>as we press on um I just wanted to point<br>out one of the things what what got me<br>into this why I<br>am a Renaissance unicorn or whatever I<br>am um it was a the time between<br>finishing my PhD and um starting my my<br>post-doctoral<br>fellowship um I spent some time two and<br>a half years working at a place called<br>the center for inquiry based learning in<br>the Arts and social sciences at the<br>University of Sheffield which no longer<br>exists but for a brief sort of five and<br>a half year period<br>um during which I was at it for for some<br>of um we were funding lots of projects<br>and working with people to experiment<br>with with pedagogy and with tech<br>technology and to basically to sort of<br>like play around with how we teach the<br>subjects that you know subjects in the<br>Arts and social<br>sciences and that's really what got me<br>interested in the whole like how we<br>teach um at the same time as I was had<br>my sort of medieval and sort of late<br>antique his history um history<br>historical interests one project that<br>I've done recently is um that that I've<br>been involved in recently with a with a<br>number of Partners at various<br>universities which you can see listed on<br>here um is about was about online<br>reading um which was which was um which<br>I'm going to tell you a little bit about<br>over the next the next couple of slides<br>and then I'll intersperse some of that<br>over the rest of the the<br>presentation what we were interested in<br>doing was finding out how we teach PE<br>students to learn or to read online when<br>they come to<br>University and also what practices do<br>they adopt how do they actually do it um<br>and I'm pleased that one of the students<br>who was involved in that project is<br>actually here Annabelle so amazing<br>thanks for coming Annabelle who now<br>works in our department<br>um so we we did some surveys we did some<br>work with students we did some work with<br>colleagues to try and identify what's<br>kind of good practice what works what<br>doesn't um so here's some of the things<br>that we found out I'm also uh sort of<br>addicted to GE lingo which I know those<br>of you who teach languages I I<br>appreciate it's not a very good way of<br>learning languages but it is also<br>extremely addictive um if you're into<br>really tedious things anyway so<br>um we asked for example one of the qu<br>questions we posed to the um teachers<br>who responded to our Sur uh survey was<br>how important is online reading to<br>students learning in your discipline so<br>that online reading how important is it<br>and I think we can all agree that there<br>are a few outliers but pretty much<br>people think it's rather important yes<br>is that your reading of the graph too<br>good I well that's what I'm telling you<br>it is anyway um but then we asked<br>um staff and students to rate how good<br>they thought<br>um they<br>were staff thought that students were<br>sort<br>of you know if to sum it up in a sort of<br>just sound like<br>me sort of online reading they're kind<br>of okay but more of them are not very<br>it when we have students we get almost<br>the exact reverse of that result um<br>students you know most of them thought<br>they're kind of okay at it but a lot<br>more of them thought that they're really<br>quite we're really quite good at this<br>online reading business um and hardly<br>any of them thought that they were they<br>were rubbish at it so you've got a kind<br>of interesting Divergence there between<br>what the student the staff think and<br>what the students think<br>the and the the staff responses in a way<br>when we we D dug into that are in a way<br>a little bit more more more um<br>interesting there's a very strong idea<br>amongst those that students at least<br>struggle to understand texts and<br>arguments which is obviously a bit of a<br>problem because that's what we're trying<br>to get them to do um they often use the<br>wrong tactics when they're trying to<br>engage with text so they'll they'll<br>adopt a surface approach to reading when<br>it would be better to try and really dig<br>into it and then sometimes do the<br>reverse adopter sort of really try and<br>really dig into it and what we want them<br>to do is to just kind of float above it<br>bit the the one of the things as well is<br>that um academic respondents were really<br>like strongly of the opinion that<br>digital distraction is what's causing<br>all of this that what's social media is<br>rotting students brains and it means<br>that they're incapable of ringing<br>reading long texts long long bits of<br>writing um and that when they do embark<br>on the process of reading a long text<br>they simply can't concentrate enough on<br>it I'm not saying that that's true or<br>false but that's the perspective that<br>was put across um that that's the sort<br>of dominant sort of view around this<br>kind of distraction that's there and<br>also that there's a huge amount of<br>students talked about this too a huge<br>amount of distraction in the sort of<br>digital environment that it's hard to<br>hard to put your phone down it's hard to<br>close the app and focus on your reading<br>and I think we we've all experienced<br>probably so in the third part of the<br>lecture I'm going to talk a little bit<br>about um no I'm not going to talk a<br>little bit there's going to be a good 20<br>minutes in which I talk about um reading<br>lessons um I'm going to talk about how<br>people read in late Antiquity how they<br>were taught to read and I'm going to<br>make some<br>probably quite tenuous efforts to relate<br>that to digital reading but I'm going to<br>have a go<br>this object which is not to scale it's<br>it would have been it is much<br>smaller um is a small fragment small<br>fragment of um uh of of<br>pottery um on which somebody has written<br>in Greek very several lines copied out<br>several lines of home um um of home as<br>Iliad and this this object illustrates a<br>number of important points again the<br>focus on these these Classics Tech the<br>classical texts a small cannon of<br>important texts like like Homer it<br>focuses on the idea of repetition as<br>being really<br>important it connects reading and<br>writing which I think um is something<br>that I often forget about the two are<br>inter inter<br>interconnected<br>obviously um and it it illustrates how<br>Romans wrote on pretty much anything<br>this is the equivalent of a Roman<br>Post-It note<br>it's something that's lying around that<br>you can pick up and sort of scribble on<br>and then throw away but they're using<br>materials that are accessible that are<br>you're cap that you can write on as part<br>economy so I'm going to start by talking<br>a bit<br>about reading more or reading less or<br>the quality of<br>reading so when I first when I first<br>started teaching and I'm thinking about<br>the first probably five or six years<br>that I was<br>teaching<br>I I thought that the students didn't do<br>the reading and obviously some students<br>don't do reading I'm not naive enough to<br>think that they all do the<br>reading um and I think some of that<br>frustration fueled my my vicarious<br>interest in the violence of the<br>classroom in the late late Roman<br>period um but then I I I over time<br>thinking about it talking to some<br>students I figured out that probably<br>what I I I think what's going on on a<br>lot of occasions is that it's not that<br>students haven't done the reading it's<br>that they haven't processed the reading<br>it's that they haven't either by magic<br>or because we've encouraged them to sort<br>of like worked through it thought about<br>it they've sort of passively sailed<br>through it and got to the end they've<br>ured it survived it and then they don't<br>really know what it was all about<br>in some cases so I developed some<br>strategies to try and help them to to to<br>engage some of which I learned figured<br>out myself some of which I learned by<br>talking to to colleagues so I tried to<br>SCA scaffold the reading Provide support<br>for them I definitely tried to give them<br>less of it to make it seem less<br>intimidating I tried to grade their<br>reading so to give them marks for for<br>the reading that they done figure out a<br>way in which I could assess<br>it and I tried one of the things that<br>technology allowed me to do was to<br>figure out ways in which I could get a<br>perspective on what the students had<br>read before they came to class so to<br>start to see the students reading more<br>in a sort of live way rather than<br>something that is simply presented to me<br>in the class where I'm like or they<br>haven't done it or in the assessment<br>where I'm like the essay they didn't get<br>more okay<br>um so like I said Romans are really into<br>literacy um and Christianity is a is a<br>religion of the Roman Empire it merges<br>within the Roman Empire and flourishes<br>within<br>it this is a really one of my favorite<br>texts<br>ever um it's an apocryphal text from the<br>2 Century um and it gives an account of<br>Jesus's um<br>childhood so it's one of those texts<br>that doesn't make the direct director's<br>cut of the Bible as we know it<br>today<br>um but these these texts are really<br>interesting because they reflect<br>contemporary social values you can see<br>that that manifested in the way they<br>talk about not just education but loads<br>of other things the text isn't written<br>to tell us about Roman values of<br>education but it does tell us about<br>those by accident<br>almost so my reading of this this text<br>and the longer text is is that Christ is<br>essentially like in a superhero film<br>it's where the early stages where you're<br>learning to harness the power and the<br>power is sort of running out of control<br>how does the young young person who's<br>possessed of these Supernatural Powers<br>learn to harness them so it tells us<br>about literacy Joseph wants wants Jesus<br>to be educated so that he can move on in<br>the world it's reflecting the idea that<br>fathers are responsible for the literacy<br>of their children of their<br>sons um it's reflecting the violence of<br>the classroom and that<br>violence I think happily if it had to be<br>violent it wasn't just the teachers<br>beating up the students it was the<br>students beating up the teachers as well<br>everybody could have a go so Jesus<br>basically talks back to the teacher he<br>says you<br>know if you know what A and B are in<br>Greek Alpha and beta you tell tell me<br>I'm not going to tell you cuz I already<br>know cuz I'm you know special the<br>teacher gets annoyed and hits him on the<br>head teacher on student violence Christ<br>curses the teacher the teacher falls<br>down dead seemingly falls down dead I<br>should say because the bit that I didn't<br>afterwards it's all resolved and the<br>teacher recovers and everything's okay<br>in the end so um but it's this idea of<br>sort of like this the struggle to make<br>somebody literate um Can can involve<br>these sort of violent<br>processes this also work the the sort of<br>violence is also reflected in the<br>grammatical instruction this is um quote<br>from a a secondary author in which<br>they're talking about the model verb<br>that's used in the in the the verb<br>tables that teach people<br>Greek so when I was learning Latin the<br>model verb was am Amar amas I love you<br>love he she loves<br>Etc that's that that's proposing quite a<br>nice view of the world isn't it the<br>quite a nice view of the classroom if<br>that's what you're repeating over and<br>over again to learn the verbs to learn<br>the<br>language in the in in late Antiquity in<br>this particular collection of can verb<br>tables the the model verb is to beat the<br>verb the words that have been would have<br>been<br>repeated repeated over and over again<br>were I beat you beat he he beats now<br>when I do this with students as an<br>Outreach activity not beating them<br>telling them about this I get them to to<br>to say these words out and to have a to<br>think about you know how the language is<br>functioning and what what sort of<br>message that might be giving about the<br>relationship between an individual um or<br>developing their their relationship to<br>their<br>learning um because the language works<br>in the future and in the passive doesn't<br>it I will be beaten it's pretty dark<br>um okay so this speaks about the violent<br>process of Education as well as its kind<br>of content in this<br>period it talks about it speaks to this<br>idea of drill and repetition being<br>really<br>important<br>um and it talks about yeah so so like<br>volume is important and that may me<br>think well maybe my stripping back the<br>reading getting them to read less wasn't<br>such a good idea should I be figuring<br>ways of getting my students to read<br>more so when we did our little survey um<br>we ask students um how much reading how<br>much reading do you do a week um and<br>depending upon the audience I've spoken<br>about this to people are either really<br>shocked or totally unsurprised so I'll<br>be interested to see which Camp you fall<br>in the good news about this graph is<br>that as students progress through their<br>studies they are reporting to us that<br>they read more as they move on on it is<br>still suggesting that 50% of our first<br>year respondents first year<br>undergraduates um<br>read less than 5 hours a week in total<br>for their studies which is quite<br>shocking considering our respondents<br>were mostly from Humanities disciplines<br>where we want them to read a lot there's<br>also one PhD student who's reading less<br>than five hours a<br>week which they must have just clicked<br>the wrong button I think so there's<br>we also asked people if they had a an<br>disability that affected their ability<br>to engage in reading and we found that<br>um that people who have disability are<br>le as we would expect less likely to<br>engage in online reading compared to<br>their peers who don't report having that<br>disability it's not unexpected but it<br>does suggest there's a sort of there<br>might be a there's a sort of vicious<br>cycle in operation that you're less<br>likely to read therefore you read less<br>which presumably is going to impact your<br>engagement and um<br>Etc so the next thing I wanted to talk<br>about was understanding your audience<br>and and and um we speak a lot about um<br>students moving from uh School into<br>University we call it<br>transition um and I think a lot of that<br>focuses on what students can't do what's<br>wrong with students when they get to<br>University instead of thinking about<br>what can they do how can we turn that I<br>think it would be interesting to talk<br>about how we could turn that into a<br>positive and one of the most<br>um transformative things for me one of<br>the most inspirational things over<br>actually over the last couple of years<br>has been the amount of work that I've<br>done with teachers uh and talking to<br>teachers about some of these issues is<br>really really interesting because they<br>give you a they've given me a different<br>perspective on on on our um on students<br>and on reading<br>and our our our teachers these the<br>teachers that I want that I'm talking to<br>you about today were very well aware of<br>their Their audience they knew that they<br>needed to pitch what they were what they<br>were speaking about and what they were<br>teaching about at an appropriate level<br>this is a quote from Augustine in a text<br>in which he's talking about how do you<br>educate somebody in the basics of<br>Christianity and he's saying well what<br>you because you will have a diverse<br>audience what you need to do is pitch<br>your education at different levels you<br>need to think that people who come from<br>the schools of rhetoric will be much<br>more into serious questions he calls<br>it um we need to encourage those people<br>to be humble because they might have a<br>tendency to kind of think themselves<br>to the r the Rudy bus the people that<br>the the bumpkins the people who don't<br>have very much education or any<br>education you need to adopt different<br>strategies we can see this in how he<br>tells the story of his own education I'm<br>not expecting you to read that<br>um but what he talks about is he gives a<br>narrative in this autobiography<br>of I learned rhetoric and that was<br>intended to make me into a lawyer then I<br>became a teacher of<br>rhetoric then I moved then because the<br>the students in Carthage where I was<br>teaching weren't very well behaved I<br>moved to Rome where they were I heard<br>they better be they were better behaved<br>then I got a the dream job I got a job<br>in Milan as the professor of rhetoric in<br>Milan which at that time was the<br>imperial<br>capital so he's giving a story of his<br>kind of that he's giving a story that<br>everyone can identify with who is<br>literate in this period he's talking<br>about him like living the dream he was<br>really good at rhetoric and he kind of<br>moved through this<br>system he's also in a way presenting<br>himself S<br>as um as an every man kind of figure<br>that people can identify with he<br>presents himself um in in this this kind<br>of this specific kind of way right and<br>he talks about his conversions he<br>doesn't just have one conversion he has<br>many conversions he talks about how I<br>was really into Cicero and that was when<br>I was into rhetoric and that was a bit<br>rubbish in the end I didn't think that<br>was very good then I was into philosophy<br>but that was sorry to the philosophers<br>who are here but that was the wrong<br>choice I shouldn't have been into<br>philosophy then I dabbled in this this<br>religion called manism which is a kind<br>of dualistic religion um and that was<br>kind of interesting for a bit but I<br>didn't really like that after I read<br>about it then I read about Christianity<br>and that that dragged me in a bit more<br>then I read about aesthetic Christianity<br>that was what really really kind of got<br>me involved so he he unfolds this story<br>as his career is developing of reading<br>being the thing that converts him that<br>life it ends that that final conversion<br>ends with the the the event that's<br>depicted here where he he reports having<br>been um in a garden in Milan sort of I<br>can only describe as kind of having a<br>bit of a moment not really sort of like<br>you<br>know um struggling a little<br>bit and he sits there and what he says<br>is I Heard a Voice telling me um to Le<br>pick it up and read it pick it up and<br>read it he says there's this child's<br>voice kind of that he hears when he's in<br>the garden it makes him pick up this<br>book and he reads um St Paul's epistle<br>to the Romans and that makes him convert<br>that's the moment that that for that<br>causes his<br>conversion so it's very much this story<br>um of of conversion through reading so<br>people like Augustine know how to press<br>the buttons of the people that they're<br>teaching in the stories that they're<br>telling about themselves in the stories<br>that they're telling about reading<br>they're using this as a means of kind of<br>getting the audience on side and how and<br>engaging<br>them so let's think back to our our um<br>our um survey digital reading is really<br>important to our students so um digital<br>reading is really important to our<br>students and they're not very good at it<br>so how much time do you spend thinking<br>about it in your classes uh not very<br>much so there are some and obviously we<br>were asking people who maybe don't see<br>that as their primary responsibility<br>we're trying to teach lots of things to<br>our students but there's a disjunction<br>there when we come to think about<br>reading<br>online and we got this is my favorite<br>negative response to the question which<br>made me wonder why why this person even<br>bothered to fill in a survey that's<br>about how we teach reading but this kind<br>of it's the students responsibility they<br>need to do the reading it's not up to us<br>to understand who they are or where they<br>I'm going to propose that reading<br>together collaborative reading is really<br>important to thinking through some of<br>these these<br>issues<br>um and as you've seen there's this<br>strong tendency towards violence and the<br>use of force to encourage people to<br>learn in the in the late Roman<br>world my supervisor who I won't name my<br>PhD supervisor gave me an anecdote when<br>I was starting out learning he said that<br>his supervis visor had told him of the<br>best way to get students on<br>side is in the first week or two what<br>you really need to do is to Comm commit<br>one act of flagrant<br>Injustice and then the students will<br>never know what to expect from you and<br>will always be sort of on edge and ready<br>to do they'll be at your beck and call<br>because they won't know how to cope with<br>this now I don't think that's probably<br>the best strategy but<br>um at the same time as some of our<br>authors talk about the use of force they<br>also talk about the importance of kind<br>of<br>curiosity this is Augustine talking<br>about how he started to learn the Greek<br>classic sorry for any Greek classicists<br>in the room he reports having hated the<br>Greek Classics because he was forced to<br>learn them it wasn't like how he learned<br>Latin which was his native language<br>curiosity and like I I told you before<br>he he's tells this story of his life<br>unfolding through these reading reading<br>episodes when he gets to Milan he says<br>the the the the pivotal moment when he<br>got to Milan was meeting this man called<br>Ambrose who was<br>Bishop and he<br>says two things two more reading<br>conversions that Ambrose affected for<br>him<br>one he says I saw ose reading silently<br>to himself and I was like mind was blown<br>because a common practice in the period<br>was that reading would be something that<br>you would do aloud so he sees this kind<br>of Cutting Edge technology technology of<br>reading which is to read to yourself and<br>it kind of transforms the way he thinks<br>about<br>reading he also says that rrose<br>introduces him to ways to read the<br>Christian scripture that make him think<br>differently basically says um and I this<br>is not on the slides um when I first<br>looked at the scriptures when I was<br>young<br>they appeared to be quite unworthy<br>unworthy to be compared to the Dignity<br>of Cicero I was repelled by their style<br>what Ambrose does is teaches him how to<br>read these texts in a deeper way so what<br>you can do is start to he teaches him<br>how to look at the hidden meaning<br>underneath the words the Mysteries that<br>underlay<br>them and then he talks about how in in<br>the other text the texts about how to<br>preach how to preach to the<br>bumpkins some people it's really an<br>effective way of teaching them is to<br>teach them these hidden meanings because<br>it will pique their<br>curiosity it's most useful for these men<br>to know that the meaning is to be<br>regarded as superior to the word so it's<br>not reading the text literally it's<br>thinking about the meanings that are<br>them um so I'm going to press on because<br>I've got a few slides left and not much<br>time um one of the things that I've been<br>interested in um is how we read together<br>online and I've did a lot of work in a<br>technology uh called Talis Elevate which<br>I won't bore you about in great detail<br>but it was a tool that enables students<br>to read together by annotating texts<br>online and for me this was um<br>transformational because it enabled me<br>finally to be able to see how the<br>students read more or less live as they<br>are reading they are annotating I can go<br>and access that before class and it<br>enabled me to start to see see students<br>reading which was and well through them<br>through the medium of whatever The<br>annotation they'd<br>added so this was super powerful for<br>me um we asked our students what do you<br>think of this in the survey that we did<br>and they quite they much prefer being<br>able to see what other people have<br>written online that's a really good<br>thing but we're a bit less keen on<br>sharing what we think so there's certain<br>kind of anxiety around sharing what you<br>think but students report this as being<br>like a really powerful driver for<br>cases<br>right so the final part of the lecture<br>um was inspired by my wife who said are<br>you going to talk about jut GPT a few<br>days ago and I was like oh crap I've<br>forgotten to talk about chat GPT so the<br>final few minutes are going to be about<br>AI I think one of the things about Ai<br>and reading is that we really focus a<br>lot in if we've thought about it about<br>how things like chat GPT generate text<br>they automate the process of writing you<br>can you know when you put something into<br>chat GPT you can see it writing really<br>quickly what we don't think about so<br>much is that it automates in in the<br>process of doing that it automates the<br>process of reading as well so I I asked<br>um a an AI tool called um Runway to<br>generate a I asked it to generate an<br>image but it generated a video so I'm<br>just going to show you a quick video a<br>video that represents ask AI to<br>represent the relationship between Ai<br>and<br>reading it's pretty rubbish isn't<br>it um it's quite a literal depiction of<br>machine<br>reading um but it did it did the job um<br>um so one of the things I wanted to say<br>is um<br>that like the anxiety around chat GPT is<br>and and AI is real but we also need to<br>kind of I think if we can put some of<br>these things in a bit of longer term<br>perspective we will see that you know<br>these are some of the some challenges<br>that we faced over time um people have<br>developed tools to meet the challenges<br>of dealing with information uh<br>information overload um in lots of<br>different contexts so in late Antiquity<br>we see a transition a technological<br>transition from the dominant form of um<br>text Medium being the scroll the Papyrus<br>scroll to it being the Codex the book as<br>we as we understand it now we see a huge<br>kind of shift in that period of time um<br>and I'm running out of time so I'm not<br>going to explain very much about that<br>but that is connected to shifts the<br>bigger shifts that we see politically<br>and religiously<br>access to Papyrus which only grows in<br>Egypt is is more restricted because of<br>the fragmentation of the Empire so<br>people have to figure out new ways of um<br>of making text mediums things you can<br>write<br>on and parchment the the the material<br>that we start to use in the west which<br>is made of animal skin does not lend<br>itself to being rolled up like like<br>Papyrus<br>does Isidor my my uh PhD guy used to be<br>is somebody who's sort of like dealing<br>with some of these<br>issues um he used to be seen as a bit of<br>an idiot um a Dark Age sort of like a<br>Dark Age figure somebody who's<br>desperately trying to save some of the<br>learning of of antiquity but not really<br>knowing what he's doing and you can see<br>this this is one of his friends bralo<br>who's writing about what Isidor<br>did um his main text that he writes is<br>something called the atmology and this<br>becomes a foundational text in the Early<br>Middle Ages and through the medieval<br>period for un for people's understanding<br>of language<br>language um so let's have a look um what<br>so one of the things he's doing is<br>trying to process all of this learning<br>that's available to him tons of stuff so<br>in his atmology this is a list of all of<br>the different sources of the etymologies<br>a vast list of classical and early<br>Christian Learning and he's trying to<br>condense<br>that the method that he uses<br>um well he organizes it thematically<br>into a series of books um which are<br>intended to kind of have a comprehens of<br>like comprehensively record<br>knowledge um it's not a dictionary it's<br>more of an<br>encyclopedia it starts with traditional<br>Roman education grammar and rhetoric<br>sprinkles in a bit of Christian stuff<br>and then has a bunch of things that we<br>would I think would consider you know to<br>be he's attempting to kind of generate<br>this kind of comprehensive<br>encyclopedia focused on the origin of<br>words so let's have a look at um oh yeah<br>and his you know what used to be seen as<br>his sort of like useless compendium of<br>useless<br>knowledge um randomly compiled in this<br>sort of<br>Encyclopedia contributes to him being<br>known as the patron saint of the<br>internet<br>um the source of all useless information<br>so what's he trying to do in the<br>etymologies how do you find out what<br>he's trying to do let's look at his<br>definition of atmology what he says is<br>atmology is useful because it allows you<br>to trace the origin of a word and if you<br>know the origin of the of a word you<br>know what it really means it's kind of<br>core<br>meaning it allows you to get right back<br>to to<br>Basics so it's it's an attempt to kind<br>of encapsulate knowledge by by this kind<br>of tracing of<br>Origins it's not a dictionary but unlike<br>Dr<br>Johnson in Black<br>Adder as depicted by Robbie c train<br>Isidor doesn't leave out<br>sausage um which gives which gives an<br>indication of some of his working<br>practices so lanika a kind of sausage is<br>SOC called because it was first made in<br>lucania so<br>in this case it's it's very simple it's<br>because it has a geographical origin<br>he's really into these kind of word<br>plays if it sounds like it it probably<br>is that's where it comes from he says<br>specific type of sausage is meat cut<br>into small bits because intestines are<br>stuffed with it so he's making a link<br>between the noun faren and the the the<br>verb<br>far that is filled with other things<br>mixed in if you were to read the text<br>there are thousands and thousands and<br>thousands of these sorts of of atmology<br>he's trying to kind of comprehensively<br>encapsulate um<br>knowledge this and the kind of codex<br>format mean that he and the people who<br>follow him have to figure out ways of<br>organizing<br>knowledge one of these is to excerpt<br>bits of Isidor and use it to help you<br>understand other<br>texts so to reuse it you might<br>illustrate it like drawing a diagram of<br>a hedgehog<br>because according to Isidor hedgehogs<br>feed their young by visiting Vines<br>plucking the grapes from The Vines and<br>as you can see there sticking them on<br>their spikes and then going and enabling<br>the the young to eat the the the the the<br>um the grapes off the the<br>spines sort of cocktail sausage delivery<br>mechanism for<br>Antiquity and there were more practical<br>means in which you might have engagement<br>you might do things like develop tables<br>of<br>content um you might develop visual<br>methods for representing some of the<br>text that Isidor had<br>generated um so different ways of of<br>navigating this<br>information<br>um when I first started teaching we used<br>to have this approach to new<br>technologies lots of you'd see that a<br>lot on lecture slides and and and<br>handouts don't use Wikipedia it is like<br>the worst thing you could possibly do<br>and over time what we've started to do<br>is think about well maybe there are<br>productive ways in which we can start to<br>engage students more productively with<br>this I realize that Wikipedia isn't a<br>direct analogy for chat GPT but the<br>process by which we're thinking about it<br>at University and in school I think is<br>is really productive we're thinking<br>about how can we engage students with it<br>and teach them about it rather than try<br>to scare them off it because it failed<br>dismally with Wikipedia so maybe a more<br>productive engagement would be possible<br>with um<br>AI um and here is where my favorite<br>tools that allow you to see the process<br>in operation how you can see students<br>reading might be a way forward in<br>thinking about this rather than thinking<br>about the product that students have<br>produced which they can do by writing<br>some prompts in in chat GPT or whatever<br>maybe we we experiment with a that allow<br>you to address the pro the process like<br>instance okay so um I'm just going to<br>talk to you very briefly Amy mentioned<br>my next project which kind of wraps<br>together a some of this stuff<br>um um because the bit of my research<br>that I haven't really talked about is<br>like is the social history of the church<br>in late Antiquity which is something<br>that I've been working on for a long<br>time um um and my next project or the<br>project that I'm sort of starting out<br>now is to think about the role of um<br>unfree people and people who often often<br>aren't even named in our sources and<br>think about their role in the making of<br>the church um so what you've got here is<br>a quote a letter from Isidor to Bro in<br>which he talks about losing losing a<br>previous letter that he'd been<br>sent you know what we would have thought<br>about what I would have thought about<br>before embarking on this project is the<br>two big men bro and Isidor but in the<br>letter what you can see he he's talking<br>about a royal servant boy a chamber<br>servant who were involved in the<br>transmission of this text and also the<br>loss of this this<br>text um servant servant is just a<br>euphemism it means an enslaved person so<br>I'm interested in exploring the roles of<br>these sorts of people in knowledge<br>production in this case in the<br>interaction between Isidor and bro and<br>the inscription there is a is a<br>recording records the building of some<br>Churches um and it in the south of Spain<br>in about the year 600 and what it talks<br>about is you know there's this there's<br>this illustrious man who pays for the<br>building of the<br>churches what people haven't looked at<br>so much is that it also mentions the<br>role of his enslaved workers who did the<br>work to build the churches so what I'm<br>going to be working on over the next um<br>few year well hopefully it'll be quicker<br>than that year or two is the role of<br>these kind of enslaved people in the<br>sorts of processes that I've been<br>talking about the people who are kind of<br>doing the actual work who are um doing<br>the work that enables this knowledge<br>production this education system to<br>happen that is the end of my talk and I</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
