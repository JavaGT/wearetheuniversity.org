However, these indicators are not commonly used to supplement estuarine monitoring programmes due to the complexity of application to shallow intertidal water bodies. Therefore, in this study, we use the modified Lyzenga’s model to demonstrate how satellite-derived dominant wavelength and diffuse attenuation coefficient in band blue (Kd Blue) can be used as indicators to monitor estuarine water health over large scales in 12 New Zealand estuaries. These two indicators integrate several parameters including chlorophyll-a, coloured dissolved organic matters (CDOM), and suspended particular matters (SPM) due to their high correlation with OACs. Although smaller scale variability was site-specific, both indicators showed a strong seasonality in summer and winter. In addition, dominant wavelength and Kd Blue were correlated (R = 0.83) and allowing Kd Blue to be inferred ins deep channels. By combining with K-means clustering, twelve estuaries were categorised into three groups including less impacted, moderately impacted, and highly impacted. Classes were well-aligned with other in situ monitoring methods such as light availability, benthic health model scores, and eutrophication index. The study provides a foundation for future work assessing estuarine health automatically using satellites, which can provide a step change in spatial and temporal resolution, which may allow improved detection of impending system state changes.<br> <br>Zhanchao Shao is currently doing his PhD in Environmental Sciences at the University of Waikato. His study focuses on estuarine health monitoring using satellite data and machine learning to simulate the potential effects of sea level rise and climate change on New Zealand's coastal environments. Zhanchao is going to continue his study as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Environmental Research Institute after his PhD to keep contributing to coastal process modelling and estuarine restoration.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>for it all right well welcome everybody<br>to today's ER seminar and it's my<br>pleasure to introduce Z cha cha here<br>I've known him since 2018 when he<br>started here at the University of w with<br>his um<br>Master's studies and Karen Bryan his<br>supervisor recruited me to be on his<br>committee because of my expertise and<br>remote sensing and um and and the one<br>thing that I really enjoyed working with<br>Zang sha was that he really didn't shy<br>away from difficult problems in remote<br>sensing what we often do is we take<br>pictures usually from satellite and we<br>study what we can see um and derive and<br>it's it's hard to enough to look at<br>water and derive the properties that we<br>want to know about in water from remote<br>sensing images but janga really was<br>interested in the things that he<br>couldn't see with satellite imagery so<br>he was looking for water that was on top<br>that was in Shallow environments esteres<br>where where a lot of the<br>reflectant that you would pick up from a<br>satellite actually came from the bottom<br>and so you didn't see much water but<br>that's those are areas of course that<br>are immensely important for for Ecology<br>for biodiversity and for us who live<br>near shallow water environments um so so<br>this is a really important topic that he<br>studied and then he went on to<br>derive solutions to the problem of<br>looking at the water in shallow water<br>environments and in The Next Step he<br>then applied this with environmental<br>modeling photosynthesis modeling in<br>order to to to take this a step further<br>to productivity of eseries and um and<br>and so that's the part that I really<br>enjoyed working with him he he picked<br>difficult problems he worked at it hard<br>and he came up with results he's got two<br>great papers uh published right now um<br>and he's finished his PhD that is due to<br>be uh examined on very soon and he<br>started a post do with the ER here at<br>wado so he's going to be around for a<br>little while so that's awesome um but uh<br>I'll shut up now and let you speak so<br>Flor is all yours thank you hello<br>everyone I am gen show I'm here for five<br>years it's my first talk to do a onour<br>presentation here I'm so super nervous<br>but so excited to see guys here thank<br>you guys oh so I would like to talk<br>about my today um evaluating and<br>classifying New Zealand estan house<br>properties uh but right before I go to<br>my presentation I like to get more<br>information about<br>M as Maris mentioned before I came here<br>in 2018 and after one year a half I<br>finished my the uh Master here and I<br>received invitation from Karen bran and<br>I started my fish Journey with her and<br>last mon I start making my thesis finger<br>crossed on hope I can receive the<br>feedback soon and now I am a post doctor<br>researcher working for EI and have a lot<br>of uh research interest I like remote<br>sensing and like machine learning numer<br>simulation and personally I stand for<br>progr I am P programmer I'm trying to<br>learn more about MTH and I'm prob big<br>Traver so uh currently I'm working on a<br>project about the fungal uh so we are<br>trying to find out how much stent are<br>going to be uh deposit after like 100<br>years and we can give more information<br>for the communities and scientific teams<br>over there yeah that's what I'm doing<br>right<br>now and during my P dur definely we have<br>a lot of people help me before and a lot<br>of people are right here so I want to<br>thank my supervisors Karen krat moris<br>Donna and all my colleagues and friend<br>from customer group W University and I<br>need to say a big thank you to uh Dr JY<br>from con she gave me a lot of very<br>useful data yeah and also because I<br>receiving a lot of fun from National<br>Science challenge s St thank you all<br>thank you<br>guys all right so let's go to my<br>presentation about my thesis so my is<br>about all about Estes because we know<br>EST is very important and complicated<br>they connect the Inland Waters and open<br>ocean that's why we have to uh evaluate<br>and monitor EST house but in my this is<br>I divide into three parts the first part<br>is water Optical properties and the<br>second part is surrounding vegetating HS<br>like seags microfat pencils and third<br>part is Coastal sement budget so we need<br>to estimate how much a sent is going to<br>be accumulated for example in Tanga Haro<br>har and other EST New Zealand which is<br>pretty important for the local<br>communities all right this is my first<br>part so classifying exterior uning<br>satellite derived Optical properties<br>from from shallow intertitle asies so I<br>would like to give some background of<br>This research so generally our Aster<br>under under St because the increased uh<br>extreme weather events and the strong<br>human impacts So currently we're trying<br>to do more um measurements and<br>sustainable work to protect our EST<br>Series so we use clity turbidity diffuse<br>the T coent or water calor to evaluate<br>overall health of the series but these<br>traditional indicators are really very<br>expensive and really need a lot of<br>people to do it we want to do the large<br>scale so so from the third chapter I<br>would like to explore the possibility of<br>a uning satellite derived Optical<br>properties and to classify the S with<br>similar conditions for consistent<br>management but I would like to mention<br>here as the data I use for all my<br>chapters is the<br>to because it can provide very good spal<br>and tempor tempor resolution at large<br>scales so here are the meths from my<br>first and first first big part so we<br>have certain different sites in to<br>across New Zealand and this we start<br>from Tango and these 13 sites range from<br>rela pris ecosystem like mangi and to<br>the open influence as like manal<br>and we also have very different sement<br>sources for these regions for example we<br>have rlin which has a unior black<br>standand because of volcanos and we have<br>bangal which has a mixture of the Rocky<br>and Sandy shortes so all these sides can<br>these SES can actually represent the<br>general classifications of allers in New<br>Zealand so it's pretty good for us to<br>start from these sides and see what's<br>going on next from next level and this<br>is our floor chart for the pth one so<br>first we are going to use the stellite<br>images to find out where are inundated<br>regions and we are going to combine<br>these inundated regions with lighter and<br>light to get into P<br>regions and because if you compare your<br>the sensors on the satellite to your<br>eyes if you can say the C here that<br>means the C can contribute a lot of<br>signals or noises to the the water<br>surface reflectance that's why you need<br>to do the<br>corrections so in this part we developed<br>a c correction model to get the true<br>water reflectance and after we have this<br>model we are going to have the crate<br>reflectance in the dual bands blue green<br>and red and then during this process we<br>are going to have the KD in different VI<br>bands as well but we prefer to use the K<br>blue here because we know the KY blue<br>has a good correlation with suspended<br>camon concentration which will be very<br>useful for the local people and we also<br>want to use uh dump Wavin to represent<br>water C because it's going to be very<br>easy and numeric uh there's going to be<br>more U information about it in the<br>coming slide and finally we are going to<br>do the class PA is on these two<br>indicators from<br>satellite and as I mentioned before uh<br>SE bed can significantly contributed to<br>the water reflectance in the shall area<br>that's why we need to do the correction<br>for C<br>buts um so we would like to use the<br>zingus model and here is the model but<br>the first thing we need to do is verify<br>or validate whether this model is going<br>to be useful or pH feasible in our<br>slides so here I give two different<br>figures thetic one and observed one so<br>for thetic one I actually set up the<br>vales for this variables so we can say<br>once the pixel it is<br>exposed uh the reflectance is not going<br>to be changed anymore so at this time R<br>is equal to RB but after the reflectance<br>is submerged so reflectance is going to<br>decrease<br>immediately and we actually can find the<br>similar Trends from satellite images<br>from two different cut elevations which<br>means we can use this model for our<br>sites it's going to be<br>useful but we can say we we have two<br>different unknown varibles both of them<br>are very important for us to divise but<br>it's very possible for us to C or solve<br>this equation we do not have any other<br>information for this method so here we<br>are going to set up an assumption so the<br>something here is the water property<br>water properties KD and RW are<br>homogeneous across a short range of<br>pixels at different water depths so this<br>means for example for from the water<br>depth of 0.3 M to 0.5 M there's only<br>going to be one r w and one KD so this<br>assumption can be equivalent to find out<br>to we have to find out the appropriate<br>value of r w which should satisfy the<br>slope between KD and z z which means KD<br>and Z on a KD and water deps is not<br>relevant and at the same time the veres<br>should be also<br>minimized so this resarch question is<br>actually becoming uh to becoming uping<br>questions so we are going to try out a<br>lot of different RW values from zero to<br>R because we know R is always the<br>largest number you have you can have in<br>this model and then we are going to do<br>numer search to find out the best values<br>for uh r w so here I give the<br>example um different colors represent<br>different estimate of our w so in order<br>to make sure the the relationship<br>between KD and work is not relevant so<br>it's the curve should be flat but it's<br>very hard to say right here point one<br>over here so I plot the slope against RW<br>so here we can see a value of r w makes<br>slope zero and the same time the re is<br>also minimized so the appropriate value<br>of RW here zero about<br>0.0 but we have to care be careful about<br>this method because we are going to have<br>a lot of Reflections as inputs but we<br>only have one RW as we assume because<br>they are homogeneous so this means this<br>meod is going to sacrifice the uh<br>resolution of the original data so it's<br>probably not going to be applicable for<br>some small sizes of the St<br>didn't and then we after we get the<br>corre Reflections we are going to do<br>calculate the water C but we prefer to<br>use dump walence because dump walence is<br>a verbal reflecting the object color as<br>it perceived by human eyes in the form<br>of digital numbers so your color the<br>color you can see can actually<br>represented by a number which is very<br>good for me because I'm color<br>scientist okay and uh so according to<br>the color signs I need to talk about the<br>defination according to the color signs<br>the D wav length is the wav length join<br>from draining from the white point to<br>the point of interest at the interest of<br>this H charge so for example uh the Dum<br>walence of of this yellow Point here is<br>about 54 so it's actually it's a green<br>color but because green has a different<br>uh uh differences in different greens so<br>this 540 NM probably actually easiest<br>way for us to represent a color in a<br>mathematic way and we can say if we want<br>to make sure uh if we want to get the<br>value of the Dum wance we have to get<br>the c x and c y we just call it a<br>chromatic or Ps which can be trans can<br>can be transferred from the TR values<br>thanks to the previous research we<br>actually do the mul linear refering from<br>the reflections to the values which<br>which allows us to to do the four<br>conversions to get the D<br>weapons and now we can look at some<br>results before and after we remove the C<br>reflectors so on the left side this is<br>the before on right side is after so we<br>can see after we remove water button<br>Reflections uh the color actually<br>becoming Greener but still bit tricky to<br>see how differ going to be so I put all<br>these values into this H chart again so<br>if you can say after remove the water<br>but Reflections the color becoming<br>Greener especially the range is going to<br>be from 540 nomers to about<br>575 nomers so most of these scatters<br>actually Gathering the r of green after<br>we remove the water bance so excuse me<br>do you mind speaking up a little problem<br>really struggling to hear Sor okay uh so<br>for KD blue uh during this Corrections<br>we can get the KD blue values but K<br>Blues have very strong uh special<br>distribution patterns we can say uh the<br>K blue values are going to be higher at<br>uh at the intersection of the water and<br>den and the value is going to be smaller<br>when it's close to De<br>channels uh and we compare the K blue<br>values to the instant major KD part we<br>can find there actually has a very<br>strong correlations between these two uh<br>indicators which means we can probably<br>use this estimator uh we can probably<br>use this<br>uh relationship to estimate the<br>available light intensity at the seab OR<br>at this water<br>surface and then we can have a look at<br>the dump wand at different sites in New<br>Zealand so uh apparently we can find for<br>most do dum to wence has seasonality so<br>for example like man raan or uh a new<br>Riv State on the value is going to be<br>higher in summer or winter but the uh<br>the variety is going to be very specific<br>so for example the blue scen here has a<br>very narrow D changes of dump weapons<br>but like fun they have a very broader<br>dump weapons<br>range and similarly we can get the dist<br>uh get values for Dum uh the KD blue<br>everywhere in New Zealand in this S<br>Series so we can say the scality of the<br>KD blue is not as strong as the D<br>walence but similarly they do have the<br>site and after we got all this<br>information we need to think about how<br>we are going to process data and what we<br>can get from this data um so here I PL<br>all these data from different sources<br>like summer winter and All Seasons so<br>par summer and All Seasons there's clear<br>correlation between the dump wance and<br>the KD blue um so which means we can<br>probably use uh this relationship to<br>estimate the KD blue values in deep<br>channels where when the Lingus mode is<br>not plat especially in the Deep channels<br>um so we have all this information and<br>we would like to find the classification<br>for these uh exteriors based on their<br>health so here we introduce K means it's<br>like AI uh classification model so we<br>div AI divid them into three different<br>uh classifications based on these two uh<br>indicators so we have highly impacted we<br>have more moderately impacted and less<br>impact it<br>so mangi and<br>uhia they still fine because the values<br>of K blue and D wlin are pretty low<br>which means they're at a good state but<br>for like f and New River so D wence is a<br>little bit too high and the Katy blue is<br>actually in the very Danger<br>border it's quite close to the<br>point<br>five so we have to we probably need to<br>pay extra attention to this S Series and<br>after we have the classication from our<br>model we need to compare them to other<br>results or other models so here I got<br>the uh results from the Bic health model<br>scores and the E to measure the power<br>review uh to measure the power values<br>and S Tropic and from Nea so apparently<br>we can find the uh the classification<br>from our models can actually match up<br>with<br>other uh measurements or other scores<br>for example like Tanga fungal and F but<br>we do have some uh disagreement with<br>other methods like murang and M we might<br>need to do actra calibrations or we<br>probably need to introduce more<br>indicators because maybe two indicators<br>in my mod mod is not enough to provide<br>the complete<br>information and that's my first part and<br>the second part about the vegetation<br>Health in the coast environment so the<br>title for this part two is scaling off<br>the Bic prary productivity estimates in<br>a large interp EST series using your Mo<br>sensing so first I like to give some<br>background about why we like to do it so<br>here I give two examp uh two two figures<br>about SE distribution in Tanga H we can<br>find this is 60 years ago and this is 10<br>years goo apparently we are losing a lot<br>of cigar in the past 60<br>years um that's why we have to do some<br>protection and monitoring on vegetations<br>in Tanga har So currently we're trying<br>to use the sados to do the some meure<br>movement work to calculate the SE<br>density in this one small quadrant and<br>we also have some uh drones to take C uh<br>to take the photos to find out where<br>distribution of the sequence and also we<br>would like to use St light data to uh<br>extract the SE in a very efficient way<br>so here I give the spectral information<br>of the different L covers and uh<br>different L covers so we can find uh the<br>sence here is very unique they're not<br>going to be overlapped with other<br>uh uh other land covers here so which<br>means we can probably use their spectral<br>signatures to extract the<br>sence and here is the simplified uh host<br>uh flow chart for my chapter two so<br>first we are going to use the St uh<br>Reflections from stellite to find out<br>where are squl and what the percentage<br>SE coverage in each pixel internal C and<br>then after we have this special special<br>map we would like to combine it with<br>some Institute measured uh productivity<br>to scale them up to find out the gpp of<br>the SE everywh in trun Hub we're going<br>to do similar stuff for on flat for mpb<br>microp pencils here so we can get both<br>results for sequals and MPV at the<br>end so but we need to uh be specific and<br>detailed about the classification Rion<br>here this actually the best part so we<br>are going to use a supervis<br>classification with random for here to<br>Define which part are SE and which part<br>are which part spot SE which part is D<br>SE and which part are the unated pl or<br>MPV uh we would like to use dad PS<br>because they all they actually very<br>robust and they can barely be over over<br>fited the reason we would like to uh<br>space SE into spots and then two<br>different classes because when the<br>sequence is too dense uh it looks like<br>flat so it's it's going to be very<br>confusing for the machine learning so<br>it's better for us to<br>separate uh so after we find where are<br>SE and where on unedited flat we are<br>going to introduce two more uh indexes<br>here into this machine learning so<br>that's normalize normalize the uh nor<br>ndwi and NBI so word index and uh<br>vegetation index here to calculate the<br>SE percentage coverage for each pixel we<br>are going to try three different machine<br>learning uh regression here including<br>the artificial neon Network support<br>Vector regression and random Force<br>regressions but we need a lot of uh<br>grous Point samples uh so we can<br>actually finish the validation and<br>testing so we carried out a lot of uh<br>field workor and turn C from north to<br>south house we actually carried about<br>one two three four five six different<br>points after different sides in turn but<br>in total we collected about 500<br>samples and then we can have look at the<br>results here so after we do the five FL<br>for validation uh we can actually get<br>the optimum values we have parameters<br>here or just put numbers here it easy to<br>see and then for testing part we can<br>actually get the classification report<br>using random Forest so like like I<br>mentioned before like the SP seers has a<br>low lower PR recall and F1 score is<br>actually the varibles to evaluate the uh<br>classification uh it's the values are<br>lower only because it's when there two<br>spots it looks like St flats or uned<br>flats but overall accuracy is about 0 96<br>is super high so I think this model is<br>impressive to do more class app work in<br>the<br>future and I put all these pixels back<br>into the map so we can actually do some<br>comparisons so on top this RV uh map and<br>on the bottom and this is the result<br>from our CL classting models So<br>currently you can see this dark area<br>the and which correspond to this green<br>areas and this like uh White are<br>actually are the plats like in this uh<br>map and after we find out where are SE<br>we want to be more specific because the<br>resolution of the satellite is 10 m<br>times 10 m so sometimes they are not all<br>full of V we want to see the density of<br>the pixel so here I tried out three<br>different machine learning recessions a<br>printer we're going to select artificial<br>new network<br>because Al like support Vector record<br>has also good uh result but prefer to<br>use for because uh it performs better in<br>validation but both of them can work I<br>think and after we have this complete<br>detection model we are going to use the<br>model from 2019 to 2022 to find the S<br>arrrows and uned erors in turn C so here<br>I give the examples of winter and summer<br>so apparently we can see in Winter we do<br>not have a lot of seers in the M of<br>Tavo and but in summer the density is<br>going to be super high it's almost close<br>to 100% especially in the metal hos but<br>we do not really have a lot of seet in<br>the South as we saw before in the two<br>figures I show you guys we are losing a<br>lot of uh SE in the South and then we<br>can have the SE area uh fluctuation<br>figure here from 2019 to 2022 we can<br>actually find there are some sequal<br>start to grow in the subtit regions<br>which is pretty good they're going to be<br>the new hotot of of<br>SE and for the inter Tian regions<br>previously we just worried they Pro we<br>probably going to lose more se but<br>actually after 2019 they are going they<br>we are having a good Tren so they're<br>going to have more Z in<br>thrang now we got this<br>um detection model we would like to<br>provide more information for uh<br>communities or for the councils so I<br>would like to combine my special map<br>with the<br>productivity measurements from ton har<br>so a colleague of mine jorina flowers so<br>she uh collected a lot of productivity<br>plost and Dr H using this incub a here<br>so she actually gave me a lot of Pi<br>curves which can be which I can use to<br>uh scale up my result and I can also use<br>light light intensity potions so after<br>we combine all this information together<br>we can actually get the productivity or<br>gpp everywhere in turn C so apparently<br>similarly in Winter we don't really have<br>a hard gpp because first they do not<br>have a lot of squl over there and<br>uh the productivity in winter is not as<br>high as in summer but in summer totally<br>opposite we can say we have a lot of s<br>over there and the gpp is accordingly<br>higher but mpb is a little bit different<br>because uh the productivity is not<br>really affected by the uh it's not too<br>affected by the seasons so we can find<br>the gpp and this Haro is not too<br>different between two ciens<br>and then we can have this we can have<br>this uh estimate estimations on cars<br>carbons from 2019 to 2022 so we can say<br>apparently they are going to be very<br>distal as uh more sees going to be uh<br>thriving in summer and less in Winter<br>and also it's going to be S specific<br>because we know we have more secret in<br>the made of Tang H and if we have more<br>sers over there which means the<br>productivity is going to be higher<br>because MPV does not really have high<br>productivity and it can be uh almost<br>like a half of half of<br>uh uh cus so generally we have more uh<br>productivity in the middle<br>problem and after we do have this uh<br>productivity information for t h we<br>would like to do something something for<br>the future and say what's going on if<br>the sea level rises and what's going on<br>the tability increases so here on the<br>left I give two different<br>assumptions um the first if the C rise<br>is coming with the buring or increasing<br>turbidity the pr s<br>once s Rises and toity increases the<br>productivity is going to be decreased<br>immediately some areas actually can lose<br>about 7 5 5% of the current productivity<br>like like here and mpb is a little bit<br>different because like for in the middle<br>Hub like here they're going to lose a<br>lot of productivity because they do not<br>have enough light but like at the inter<br>intersection of the uh or like upti<br>regions with with the sver rise they<br>actually can have more time to be<br>submerged which means they have higher<br>productivity when the sver<br>Rises and if we assume assume this uh<br>with the toity is not going to increase<br>with the water level so we are not we<br>can say cigar is not going to lose too<br>much of the current productivity because<br>they can actually compensate for it uh<br>with more time to be submerged and MPV<br>is little bit more complicated we can<br>find uh most virin can benefit from LEL<br>rise because they have more time to be<br>uh submerged and for these rins like<br>here because they have a very low<br>productivity over there um at these M<br>mudy<br>areas uh when the sver Rises they're<br>going to lose more productivity so I<br>generate all these Stars into these six<br>curves the first is we are going to have<br>a increas in turbidity and uh C rice and<br>or without and or we are going to allow<br>s second to expand to the sh short W<br>because we know the S is going to occupy<br>part of the areas if the silver Riz St<br>especially in the AL tile regions so for<br>scenario one we can say<br>um SE is going<br>to their states it's not going to be<br>affected too much but MPV can definitely<br>benefit from SL rise because they have<br>more time to be submerged and if theity<br>is going to be increased which means<br>cous productivity gpp is going to be<br>decreasing<br>immediately but uh mpb is a little bit<br>different they're going to benefit a<br>little bit from ciz and then start to<br>lose andar uh for the last scenario you<br>can say um SE can actually migrate to<br>the shower that's why they are going to<br>have a higher for uh gpp at the very<br>beginning but after that because the<br>limitation of the light availability<br>they are going to lose a lot of<br>productivity and at for the um mpb<br>similarly they going to take over their<br>uh spaces where C move from at the verb<br>game years and after year 20 52s they're<br>going to lose a lot of<br>gpp I think it's uh these are our<br>conclusions for the chapter two so first<br>a supervis classification with machine<br>learning can be used to provide very<br>detailed and accurate seos coverage maps<br>and these Maps can be used to<br>uh combine with other literature Dev<br>relationships to Define hotpots for of<br>productivities or just uh quantify the<br>importance of the SE or PV and we can<br>use this information to predict the<br>future change it will be very<br>interesting to uh probably the local<br>communities to do some protections right<br>before everything bad<br>happens and this my last chapter is<br>uh first three uh to improve the<br>estimates of suspended delivery to<br>briding envir uh<br>estering Woodland so right before I<br>start my this chapter I would like to<br>ask a question so first we know we have<br>if we want to say this uh distribution<br>of the suspended sment concentration<br>we can use death to do the moding work<br>and we can actually get data from<br>stellite images we have integer<br>measurements and we can actually uh<br>build up regressions but which one is<br>telling the true story which one is more<br>accurate death 3D or satellite I<br>strongly believe satellite is going to<br>be more more accurate because death 3D<br>actually when we calibrate the D models<br>we actually just based on the sever<br>observational points sometimes if you<br>just calibrate these points for the rest<br>pixels in this model they're not going<br>to working too well we actually did a<br>try on that so that's why we would like<br>to combine these two informations from<br>two different models and provide a<br>better uh estimates of suspense and<br>concentrations here is what before<br>charge so first we are going to set up<br>dep 3 from Modo to get the suspended<br>stand concentration from dep 3 and then<br>we are going to get the suspended sment<br>concentration from stellite based on<br>inst measurements and the according<br>relationship<br>between uh inst measurements and band<br>and the band and after that we are going<br>to compare the difference between the<br>satellite deriv suspend stand<br>concentration and DEP stud derive<br>suspend concentration like how<br>difference in each<br>pixel and then we are going to use C to<br>classify this regions into different uh<br>classes like class one can be uh very<br>very different class two is going to be<br>less different and then after we have<br>all these classifications we are going<br>to treat the uh the satellite der s say<br>as the monitoring or observed data and<br>then death St and other inputs are going<br>to be<br>the dep stud and other uh variables are<br>going to be inputs of the entire model<br>and finally we are going to get this new<br>suspended C concentration prediction<br>model and here is how we set up dep<br>rting model so we have five sides in<br>Haro so from St one to set five we Carri<br>out the Fe workor over there we<br>collected the flow FL results we collect<br>the water level result and we also<br>collect the suspense concentration from<br>these sides and we also have two sides<br>from this console and here and here so<br>they are going to to provide the<br>long-term monitoring so we can actually<br>verify if our model can be used for long<br>term<br>yeah and after we set up our dep St we<br>have to look at the stellite derived<br>suspension conentration so for satellite<br>it's going to be easy because we just<br>need to uh find the relationship between<br>bends and suspens concentration but for<br>deep and Sh it's going to be different<br>of deep regions we're going to use this<br>uh relationship on left apparently they<br>going to be more precise and on the sh<br>regions after we corrected work button<br>Reflections we're going to use this<br>relationship to get the<br>SSC and here is the information about<br>the C classifications based on the<br>difference of satellite images and DEP<br>3D so app we can say the best uh<br>classification we can have is about<br>forever point is here for so we are<br>going to classify all this difference<br>into four classes so from class one to<br>class four apparently we can find this<br>classes actually correspond to Natural<br>land covers so for example the class<br>four is actually the combination of the<br>deep channels and the shallow water<br>regions in the west and this pink areas<br>here is actually the intersection of the<br>STS and the water and for the class one<br>and class two they're actually the<br>combination of the uh interc<br>regions and then we are going to do the<br>uh new prodiction model so<br>here we are uh we are going to have a<br>look at the performance have about<br>parameters St for<br>each uh class because we have four<br>classes here so we are going to have<br>four different model so apparently from<br>class one to class four we do have a<br>very good rcare values from<br>0.76 to<br>0.79 and which means our model looks<br>fine and after we put all this<br>information into one big model that<br>going to be uh our Square value is going<br>to be 0.8 and at the same time the ma is<br>about<br>ter uh 10.10 so generally model is going<br>to be<br>precise and after we have this model we<br>would like to get the results from this<br>motor and we compare this the results<br>from model to the instit measurements<br>and the previous death 3 results so<br>apparently the red line here is the<br>Institute measurements and the green<br>line here is the results from our model<br>and the blue line here is actually from<br>Del 3D so we can say inside Point inside<br>five we our motor actually improved a<br>lot compared to dep because we can see<br>the the paks here actually not<br>corresponding too much to the uh inst<br>measurements but at the very beginning<br>days we can we do find like our motor<br>still need a lot of improvement because<br>we cannot really see any overlap lines<br>here especially for the first two or<br>three days it's either prob because the<br>weather condition is not included in our<br>model or it's because uh we did not use<br>the house do for our uh demra so it<br>might going to be some errors over there<br>and after we have the short monor<br>monitoring we would like to see what<br>about and what about the longterm<br>monitoring so we actually compelled our<br>data from the model to the uh to<br>the the two points from the two research<br>points from the counil we can find the S<br>Square values going to be lower that<br>means it's not that as precise as before<br>we used in the shortterm but generally<br>are still good we can also find our<br>values a little bit overestimated which<br>we have to do more for uh collaboration<br>the V<br>and after we do have these uh production<br>models on the suspended concentration we<br>would like to combine it with the sement<br>accumulations and other<br>models so here we would like to see for<br>example you site<br>five how much stent is going to be<br>accumulated over there there are lot<br>there are a lot of mangr over there they<br>should be able to fix a lot sets so here<br>I introduced the cross models I have the<br>ter mod and uh two model defin by myself<br>so for the CR model they actually pretty<br>easy so assumes the incoming sement is a<br>constant and there's no uh sement going<br>out app ties because we know in the M<br>groups uh they are pretty good at fixing<br>the cements that's why they can assume<br>is not there's no out sement but for t t<br>model is a little different there is<br>assume the incoming cohesive sement is<br>going to be time varing they use a<br>linear model to estimate the c0 for each<br>time and they still assume there's no<br>upgoing segments and from these two<br>small models here we assume this um the<br>incoming cohesive STS are going to be T<br>varing we can get the data either from<br>the de or our new prediction model and<br>we also assume<br>the cement is not going to move at all<br>in aing tyes and for the last um we have<br>here is the m seek out varable we both<br>assume incoming and outgoing cements are<br>going to be very as it's going to be T<br>varing and we can get the data from Del<br>s or new prediction model so according<br>to different assumptions on the incoming<br>cohesive statements we can find the<br>cohesive statements<br>and<br>uh the cohesive will be very very<br>different using these different models<br>and because we have very different<br>cohesive statements in when coming which<br>means the final results are also going<br>to be very very uh subjective so if we<br>use the constant we can have can say the<br>value is going to almost half of the<br>tance model but if we use our new<br>prediction model we can find it's going<br>to be about like once uh two3 of the dep<br>St model<br>so this story tells us probably going to<br>be more we have to be more precise when<br>predictions yeah so this is our results<br>for this uh chapter three the first is<br>the results show that the use of the<br>difference models cause substantial<br>differences in incoming cements<br>estimations which can actually further<br>per the understandment understanding of<br>the sentiment accumulations and also the<br>variability in um incoming sement<br>concentration can also cause a greater<br>differences when we apply to different<br>sment accumulation models and we do have<br>a lot work for uh uh in the P for the<br>three years and I'm pretty sure my<br>models are not really complete right now<br>so we probably need some future work to<br>make it more perfect so first first we<br>would like to do improve the accuracy of<br>the estimating the C Reflections in the<br>intertial OR subtitle regions and we<br>would like to increase the accuracy of<br>predicting sequence areas when submerge<br>and modeling the potential SEC<br>distribution<br>pland and we still can involve more<br>biological effects when we do the<br>estimations on the productivities in t<br>Caro and also for the last chapters we<br>would like to introduce more features<br>and to improve the ACT St incoming St<br>concentrations we still have a lot to do<br>uh but this model is going to be uh very<br>very important for local communities but<br>that's what we can do and what we will<br>do in the future I think that's all for<br>guys um cou questions um so back when<br>you uh showing the KD results across the<br>estries it didn't seem to me that there<br>was that much difference not just KD but<br>the other par there wasn't that much<br>difference so between Ragin West Coast<br>black some of the other sites which was<br>quite unexpected really I've got that<br>right what do you think that's about in<br>shallow water you know with the FL body<br>this is you know FS ctim yeah so like d<br>w we don't really have a lot of<br>fluctuation for example all these sides<br>as you mentioned right<br>so I think it's m because of how we<br>actually collect the data so uh although<br>we remove the water button Reflections<br>but uh some ACT some areas for example<br>like Regin no not reg for example like<br>oh or other place are very into title<br>but I'm not sh here so for step slide<br>it's actually tricky for us to extract<br>values for this interp regs even I<br>remove the water but reflectors but the<br>noise is too much so it's too hard for<br>way to do very interp areals so<br>generally we get the values that from<br>the the combinations of interp regions<br>and the Deep channels so for deep<br>channels the result are going to be more<br>uh accurate but for the inters it's<br>going to be tricky that's why uh when<br>they come PL together they're going to<br>affect the uh accuracy in okay I just<br>thought that was one of the key<br>objectives of that first party work was<br>to deal with shallow a conditions that's<br>yeah so what you're saying is that<br>there's a lot of um noise yeah still<br>it's difficult to kind of make that to<br>detect that that difference yeah my<br>second question from the last part of<br>your um study to do with the you<br>compared your um SSC um satellite<br>derived result with um the long-term<br>monitoring and it seemed for the um that<br>summary comparing the council's data<br>against yours that one so it seems like<br>there's a lot of you know uncertainty at<br>the law you say see which corresponds to<br>what's happening A3 most of the time you<br>know you had much better fot for the<br>higher<br>concentrations particularly high but um<br>yeah just wondering again you know<br>what's going on there do you think at<br>those more kind of typic those sort of<br>fair weather<br>concentrations um and that plot on the<br>right hand side yeah we do found this<br>problem like for a while like uh because<br>for this l Mar we track back to 2014 and<br>we set up another dep models and use the<br>model from that as result from Death TR<br>models to put our uh this modeling work<br>the things like um we don't really know<br>how much discharg in at that time of so<br>get more so we can see we have a lot of<br>discharges here along the coast line but<br>uh in our model we actually think about<br>that but we don't really have the<br>results for this<br>discharge from 294 to 2020 uh I think 20<br>uh<br>2015 so that's why when we put the<br>results sorry so that's why we have a<br>lot of weather conditions here when you<br>put there and you have to negate a lot<br>that's why it's going to be less<br>accurate I was going to say um yeah W<br>suspension is going to be a big play so<br>the Del model is doing W res suspension<br>of sentiment yes yeah and that's<br>incorporated into those produtions<br>yes it seems like uh we know that we<br>probably need to put more uh uh<br>indicators because the suspense<br>concentration has a lot of connections<br>with other uh stuffs pretty sure the six<br>VAR are not really enough to predict the<br>very accurate results here so we are<br>trying to put more but the things like<br>we don't really have enough data to make<br>it more perfect that's actually I think<br>I started for three say four years about<br>these things I do find<br>sometimes you have very good ideas but<br>you have the data to make it<br>perfect it's kind of like a compromise<br>when uh when we do this longterm<br>monitoring because we we see the up<br>values or we see the m is fine and we<br>don't really want to go forward but I<br>know it's pretty bad a lot of the time<br>you you were doing better than the model<br>yes that's cool and final comment was<br>are there kind of new senses coming<br>along um with satellite um that you<br>think well you know is there anything in<br>the in the wings that's going to be<br>launched that will improve the<br>data quity that you know<br>uh the first thing I would like to uh if<br>I can have a chance of probably just not<br>doing with the st2 because even it's<br>like 10 m times 10 met it's not really<br>that high probably just Max Max because<br>they have like a 0.1 M lotion so it's<br>can be super simp if we can do it for<br>our measurements or our mods especially<br>like this AA is not a really big H with<br>much smaller than the Tang and if we<br>have Max I'm pretty sure this thing<br>uh the distribution everywhere is going<br>to I mean the suspens concentration will<br>be much much more precise I think that<br>actually the first thing we can do but<br>they're expensive so sometimes I need to<br>compromise again and then uh if possible<br>we would like to put more uh uh not put<br>I mean like carry out more be workor<br>because we only have like five STS here<br>it's probably enough for the he h to do<br>the modeling work but not enough for us<br>to do a prodiction model it's basally<br>like you know machine learning is going<br>to be based on data how much data you<br>can provide and how good data you can<br>provide so Five Points definitely not<br>enough so and generally we have like<br>only have like uh 25 days monitoring and<br>but like other university other research<br>they probably just did the uh uh the DAT<br>for like one year or even like one year<br>and a half it's going to be a lot of<br>data for them to use so the training<br>data at the end is quite frustrated<br>might and apparently we can see<br>like over there thank you it just<br>doesn't work theim just though we don't<br>have more data after like six days nice<br>you well thank you very much and uh so<br>on behalf of<br>thank you very much for Shing knowledge<br>office</p></main><footer
