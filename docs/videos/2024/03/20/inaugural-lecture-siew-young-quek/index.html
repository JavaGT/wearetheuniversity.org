you to both<br>the university and also to the inaugural<br>lecture of Professor suang quick suang<br>is from<br>Malaysia she studied for a BSC and<br>biochemistry at the national university<br>of Malaysia then worked in Industry<br>before doing a PhD in chemical<br>engineering perhaps it's appropriate<br>that we're in the engineering school<br>tonight yeah at Birmingham then returned<br>to M Malaysia working initially as a<br>research scientist and then gained a<br>lectureship at University Putra<br>Malaysia in 2004 we attracted it here to<br>A lectureship in food science in the<br>school of chemical Sciences so young has<br>played a major role in developing the<br>food science program here leading the<br>program from<br>2015 she's both a teaching Award winner<br>and an accomplished grant winner<br>including as a pi at the redet Corp and<br>has also attracted over 10,000 citations<br>to her<br>Publications suan Works in areas such as<br>food properties functionalities their<br>interplay with processing aspects and<br>the creation of food products for health<br>benefits and consumer<br>enjoyment food is basic to human society<br>as children some of the first chemical<br>processes were exposed to were those<br>used in the cooking and preparation of<br>food from denaturing proteins when we<br>cook an egg to the complex interplay of<br>biological and chemical processes and<br>making fermented products such as bread<br>some of the early lessons we learned in<br>the kitchen have often led to an<br>interest and Fascination in doing novel<br>and inspiring things with<br>food it takes more than chemistry and<br>biology to prepare food that is tasty<br>nutritious satisfying and safe to eat we<br>often need to understand a combination<br>of physics medicine business Arts social<br>sciences cultural norms not to mention<br>sustainability to successfully and<br>consist consistently bring a tasty<br>nutritious plate of flu food food to our<br>table so sue young tonight is going to<br>introduce us to her passion for food in<br>the process illustrating some of those<br>complex interdisciplinary connections<br>and the passion that led her to making<br>food a career so the floor is yours<br>John Kora good afternoon<br>loboo so I'm trying to greeting in the<br>language that I know and there's one<br>moreat datang it's a Malay work of uh<br>welcome so very warm welcome to everyone<br>I'm very happy to be here after the<br>lecture uh was postponed multiple times<br>and finally I make it thanks for coming<br>academics so this is the content of my<br>talk I'm going to divide into three main<br>thing talking about my journey<br>transition to acemic and then my<br>research so let's go to the journey<br>first so I came from Malaysia as John<br>introduced so Malaysia is um if I put a<br>map here is is from uh this part of the<br>world and<br>uh I came from the northern Malaysia<br>which is a a state called K and a city<br>called suani so you can see Malaysia<br>have two part the East Malaysia where we<br>have sabba and salaak and also the West<br>Malaysia which is a peninsula and um<br>this is a country of a British colonial<br>and we independent in<br>1957 uh later this sabba and sa joined<br>into Malaysia and we formed the Malaysia<br>in<br>1963 so Malaysia is a very Multicultural<br>place you can find different uh ethnic<br>City there are three main ethnic City<br>the Malay Chinese and Indian and uh we<br>share a lot of festival and celebration<br>as you can see here the Muslim celebrate<br>a f and actually we celebrate as well to<br>be frank and then their are Chinese<br>descendant celebrate the Duna New Year<br>and also India and descendant celebrate<br>the Val or we call it de in<br>Malaysia and of course if you talk about<br>Multicultural Society we share patient<br>for different type food so you can see<br>here a very wide variety of food and<br>this actually initiate my paion for food<br>from a young age and uh you can see some<br>of the thing I like here as well like<br>this all these dishes and especially put<br>all these photo to share with<br>you yeah so Kaa is the state I came<br>from this place is called the perfield<br>of<br>Malaysia um where we have a lot of P<br>field in this stage Malaysia actually<br>produce about 2.4 million ton of par<br>each year and K alone natur contribute<br>Malaysia K is the oldest state in<br>Malaysia with the history uh Dat Back to<br>LBA bujang or we call it bujang Valley<br>and this place actually is uh in my<br>hometown Sani and the place is actually<br>more than 2,000 years when I did some<br>Trace history I was amazed to find out<br>this is actually the oldest civilization<br>in uh in Southeast Asia is longer<br>history than the uncle war that we<br>know so the place actually came traced<br>to lanasa Empire which is founded by<br>Malong mahawangsa believed to be from<br>Rome and after many generation maron's<br>descendant convert into Islam and they<br>call the stage as a kah and then the<br>ruler become a sutan of<br>KDA in<br>1909 through the angamis treaty the K<br>the suan of KDA actually consented the<br>suani and then they later in 1912 Sun P<br>was developed by British as a northern<br>administrative uh hub for nor Maya at<br>the<br>time so here you can see the clock tower<br>which is one of the famous Lark of my<br>hometown suani and uh it still function<br>until this day it was built in<br>1936 uh before the second world war to<br>celebrate the um birthday of the King<br>George 5 at the time<br>and this one showing the Su China Town<br>in<br>1900s so in place in in case the in fact<br>the place have a good history<br>behind and Back in 1970 years when I<br>grew up the place is full of Greenly so<br>you can see me as a very happy child<br>running in the P field catching uh<br>dragon fly or fing a cite and then<br>playing in the Stream playing with the<br>sand catching fish and um in the rubber<br>estate as well playing this game so um<br>the rubber seat game I don't think I<br>have time to to share with you but I can<br>tell you more about this rubber seat<br>game is exciting<br>yeah and also we have a uh lots of<br>tropical tree tropical fruits around<br>like um gowa we call Chu this one um and<br>Then star fruit coconut and I would say<br>all the children are are champ pain for<br>climing coconut tree including<br>me can you imagine me crime coconut<br>tree okay so very happily growing up um<br>nurture in the nature and there has been<br>a research saying that playing Frey in<br>nature May boost complex thinking<br>creativity and social skill in kids and<br>I think I'm very lucky in that sense<br>that in growing up in this place and<br>here I'd like to share this house mle<br>house traditional mle house with um we<br>normally play Under beneath the house<br>away from the tropical Heats and the<br>good thing is this house can be actually<br>move when people move home they move the<br>whole house together so when I first saw<br>New Zealand in New Zealand when people<br>move their home I actually wasn't very<br>surprised at all because this actually<br>happened already when I was a child in<br>my hometown<br>yeah so family my father came from the<br>southern part of China<br>when he was a teenage a teenager before<br>the SEC uh after the second world war he<br>followed his brother who actually<br>successfully established a business in<br>Malaya and my mother's family is has<br>been in Malaysia for a long<br>time yeah and I remember she has this<br>birth certificate in Jai right um<br>writing they have eight children this is<br>all of us actually it's not very um<br>supplies at the time is not very unusual<br>in my place to have eight children one<br>of my uh classmate actually have 13<br>sibling and uh it's very normal people<br>have more than four or five children in<br>a family so it's not unusual for that we<br>live in a house look like this which the<br>older generation call it the bamboo<br>house which is long uh can be like 30 m<br>long yeah this day if you want to see<br>house like this you can go to a<br>neighboring Pang State Pang state or you<br>can go to visit Singapore chinat town<br>you have similar to house so coming from<br>this big family you can imagine I<br>actually I enjoy growing up with a siing<br>around me all the time the most<br>difficult thing maybe is to find a quiet<br>piece of time to be friend it's like I<br>have to find somewhere to hide otherwise<br>there are always somebody around with<br>also activity also noise yeah but they<br>fun<br>of course sometime we have some conflict<br>we share a lot of happy moment a lot of<br>story experience but sometime we have<br>conflict and I has been the one who are<br>recognized as the person who is a good<br>Peacemaker<br>so Nur my tolerance and also the<br>Diplomatic Behavior which can be good<br>and bad<br>actually yeah so this is my<br>Shing so there are eight of us and two<br>of us actually went all the way to PhD<br>this is my eldest brother with a PhD in<br>education and me and uh three of them in<br>business the other two work in<br>accounting as um accounting area and uh<br>one housewi is my eldest<br>sister so we don't have many children<br>compared to my parent we we only have 16<br>of our next Generation when probably we<br>don't share all the similar personality<br>or whatever but they one common value we<br>share is we all believe of the<br>significant of education so you can see<br>the 16 Next Generation 10 of them um<br>have already graduated with PhD Master<br>BC or ba degree and uh the other two are<br>in University including my son and uh<br>two having vocational training two still<br>at school age so I've been very lucky to<br>to enjoy the love for all my sing and<br>me so I also like to say about my<br>father's shop this is<br>um something is my earliest opportunity<br>to learn about food product consumer<br>behavior and food packaging yeah my<br>father have a shop and and these are not<br>the photo from the shop but the concept<br>is similar where he has all this um fesh<br>produ in front of the shop um and then<br>all this uh B food in a grass jar like<br>20 plus grass jar big jar for sugar um<br>flour peanut also uh theum or something<br>like that and a shelf on the wall for<br>some can or B food<br>product yeah and they hardly any<br>packaging I mean especially plastic<br>packaging at the time and in my memory<br>my older siing are helping my my parent<br>to do some paper packaging like this and<br>sometime they even use a new space to<br>make packaging for for grocery<br>product customer normally come to the<br>shop with their R basket or wer basket<br>so there's a something like a zero waste<br>shopping concept that is getting very<br>popular now today in European countries<br>for yeah the chair is for me actually<br>because I was I was too young and I<br>couldn't help much in uh making paper<br>bag or something something like that so<br>I was normally placed on the chair and<br>because I was short I couldn't even run<br>away yeah so I sit there doing off pick<br>hours when whenever there's customer I<br>would alert my my parents saying oh<br>somebody's coming like that yeah so I<br>still play my role in that yeah so very<br>interestingly that um we have a some fun<br>product we like these are the the fair<br>things for my father's shop like colle<br>Smo over all this from old memory and uh<br>perhaps they are the functional food of<br>that at time 1970s or<br>1980s and as a child I always curious<br>like how are uh why how are this product<br>made what made them taste so good<br>especially this we really love it yeah<br>it's it's sweet and then we can put on<br>biscuit we put in a Milo and it tastes<br>wonderful yeah and also always wonder<br>why can they last longer than freshh<br>produce so without me knowing actually<br>are already asking about all these food<br>science question from from the age<br>yeah a little bit about my primary<br>school and secondary school I went to<br>local school which is like between uh<br>walking distance from my home and as a<br>child I really enjoy<br>singing um arts and interacting with<br>classmate so therefore I<br>I was always um selected as a class<br>monitor by by the classmate every year<br>almost every year yeah and then the<br>school also have a some advantage of<br>giving us a Chinese Malay and and<br>English education so from Young I<br>already benefited for being biling uh<br>multilingual actually we learned three<br>languages yeah then in the secondary<br>school I'm still very keen to organize<br>activity I was a school prefect a<br>librarian involved in the school<br>corporation shop and organized a lot of<br>activity like teach teachers um Day<br>celebration sports day schools debate<br>yeah so I did have wonderful time during<br>my my school days and many of my<br>classmate are still in contact today<br>experience so I mentioned a art and then<br>despite that the education system in<br>Malaysia at the time actually compelled<br>me to study science yeah so I just keep<br>the interest in the summer I try to go<br>through my old J and then all this to<br>share with you so these are the work I<br>produced um from primary school to<br>intermediate and after that I don't have<br>yeah so for pH education my<br>undergraduate study I choose to study<br>life science and uh I went to faculty of<br>life science in the national university<br>of Malaysia this is a public Unity there<br>were only six public Unity at the time<br>and they charge very um low fees and<br>that's the<br>reason we want to go there actually very<br>low is about 600 600 msia per year of<br>fees and the hostel also in car<br>um chip highly subsidi field is about<br>150 per<br>semester however to get into public<br>school public Unity is very difficult<br>the competition was dearly tough and<br>only the top 20% of student can can get<br>into into the public Unity during my<br>time so this Unity is um about 30 kilom<br>away from qualo the capital of Malaysia<br>and in the place called babal Bang<br>there are some very interesting uh story<br>here of course during my my day in the<br>University here is the hostel and you<br>can see the greenery of the University<br>so because I stay in the hostel I<br>normally wake up in in the bir songs<br>very nice or or monkeys<br>party because the hostel actually just<br>neighboring a bush<br>yeah<br>so one interesting story is like we we<br>normally hang our laundry outside the<br>sun yeah if someone forget to collect<br>the laundry in the evening the following<br>morning they found the monkey has<br>collected<br>them so for BC owner this is a four-year<br>program I<br>study and I major in Biochemistry study<br>a lot of subject in Biochemistry BL<br>biochemistry clinical<br>biochemistry um enzymology<br>metabolism regulation molecular biology<br>all sort thing then I also took uh six<br>microbiology forood Science Nutrition<br>and genetic<br>paper at that time I didn't know this is<br>a right decision that help with my food<br>science career<br>later for the BSC honer project I I work<br>in deit science so I'm working on um red<br>palm oil which is very rich in beta<br>carotin and I use a this oil as a frying<br>medium trying to see how is a quality of<br>frying using potato as a food<br>system I work most of the time in<br>isolation in the dark room because meta<br>keratin is very sensitive to light<br>however normally I'm not alone because I<br>would have a a classmate came to the<br>room and check about when are you going<br>to fight your next next bch of<br>potato so so they want to see if I have<br>extra portion for them for more<br>afternoon tea yeah so very interesting<br>story there so this is a batch of the<br>biochemistry um classmate I have and<br>here you can see a few Professor I would<br>say this guy finished biochemistry in<br>Cambridge this girl from uh doing<br>molecular biology in Japan and uh this<br>lady is um having um a PhD in food<br>biotechnology and became a lectur a<br>professor now actually in un P where I I<br>was I mean I was going to mention later<br>so this elegant lady here is my um<br>supervisor drct Rohani and she's very<br>project so in 1993 I graduated with a<br>BSC first class owner in Biochemistry<br>and I received the university book priz<br>as a one of the two top biochemistry<br>major<br>student this is my father and my younger<br>brother during my graduation<br>day and a very important live milstone I<br>met a guy who later become my husband<br>and and who has G me constant love and<br>support in the last 30 years and for<br>that I de appreciate and he's there here<br>yeah and we had a we had a wonderful<br>after working for a while I decided I<br>should just pursue my dream to go for<br>PhD<br>study so I I choose University of<br>Birmingham I was lucky to get a<br>scholarship from the uh cival Department<br>of Malaysia serious service of um we<br>call it jpa of Malaysia and they gave me<br>a a scholarship with condition to find<br>subject in a environmental or<br>engineering deted subject and this is<br>how I end up in engineering I have to<br>decide if I want the scholarship or not<br>but judging from the family environment<br>I don't think my parent can give me the<br>opportunity to go over so I told myself<br>this is fine I'm going to make it yeah<br>so the amount of the scholarship is not<br>enough to study in in London so I give<br>out imperian College the other thing is<br>my dream of going to Cambridge cannot be<br>fulfilled because of the um entrance<br>time I I missed the time when I get a<br>scholarship and also Cambridge didn't<br>have a engineering or environmental<br>subject at the time if I'm not<br>mistaken then I choose to go to<br>Birmingham which is actually a right<br>decision Birmingham Unity have a very<br>beautiful campus as you can see here and<br>they are established in 1900s rank in<br>the top 10 for engineering research in<br>UK this is a school where I study school<br>of chemical engineering this part is<br>actually the new building when when I<br>was there this extension wasn't wasn't<br>there so uh you can see all the red<br>portion for PhD I study uh adsorption of<br>heavy metal from water using a cultur<br>waste product I make<br>absorbent from a waste by product like<br>coconut processing waste um SEO<br>processing waste and also palm oil<br>processing waste and turn it into a<br>absorbant and use them for absorbing<br>heavy matter I study adoption processes<br>looking at equium study uh looking at<br>kinetic study I also built a a column<br>for continuous study and doing some uh<br>mathematical modeling that is proved to<br>be challenging for me and uh it took me<br>three months to get my fortron uh<br>programming work but finally I got my<br>PhD that's good yeah and my thesis is<br>recognized by examiner as a good thes is<br>a pass without correction yeah then this<br>is my uh supervisor uh Professor um John<br>W he has taught me a lot of thing<br>actually he has a very interesting<br>character he inspired me with his uh um<br>uh<br>positivity and also the Insight of<br>science<br>um and also other supervisor who are<br>very very helpful like Professor Foster<br>from Civ engineering and professor<br>engineering so I I like to say about<br>this experience I have with my PhD I<br>think this is really invariable<br>experience without this experience I<br>wouldn't think I I would come to join<br>University of Oakland As a<br>lecturer so the first thing I learned is<br>adapt to new environment in ter of<br>climate from a very sunny um 35° c<br>Malaysia to to a a winter that this it's<br>Prov difficult for me every time when I<br>try to put on layer layer CR before I<br>manage to put on everything it's already<br>outside but after a few years I I I was<br>just like one of the British who walk in<br>the rain don't care who care to get<br>umbrella because initially in Malaysia<br>if you get rain under R you got a big<br>umbrella you know so it's a chain really<br>and food as well from this St of food<br>at that time I couldn't really find<br>ingredient to prepare food like that it<br>become this typ thing and this is a<br>nightmare for me<br>jacket jacket potato with baked bean and<br>because it's normally cold but it's the<br>cheapest thing I can get on campus it<br>cost 99 P yeah CH yeah so as a poor<br>student that is the best food that can<br>fill your stomach but problem I always<br>have brought the stomach after<br>this and the other thing is the culture<br>one very interesting story you love is<br>that I went to in order to save money<br>sometime I went to the local market in<br>the city center to die to buy food and<br>every time I get something from this uh<br>food these uh people who are selling the<br>product fresh produce they will say<br>thank you my love thank you my love I'm<br>say what<br>love so in Malaysia we don't say my love<br>you know you only say my love to your to<br>your husband or you know so I was like<br>okay I'm my love I'm the lover of<br>everyone in the in the in the in the<br>market so it was quite interesting quite<br>interesting experience for me and<br>problem solving skill learning Style<br>asan versus Europe This is a East versus<br>West and you know in eastern Society we<br>are more structured um supervisor maybe<br>instruct or told student what to do it's<br>it's not uncommon they do that but in um<br>in a European country like UK my my<br>supervisor the first time I met him he<br>he was actually ask me young lady what<br>do you like to do I'm like what I<br>thought I already make my proposal but<br>he said wow you can change the scope you<br>know you can uh tell it you can make it<br>to the way you like it and later I come<br>to De appreciate that and I afraid that<br>the method I use for my PhD student this<br>day so don't blame me okay I'm British<br>train I wouldn't tell you what to do and<br>give you one piece of paper a b CDE e f<br>do this this this this<br>no yeah and also the change of subject<br>from biochemistry to engineering is pro<br>difficult to be friend there are many<br>time I I read this modeling paper<br>especially and I I was thinking oh my<br>God how am I going to understand this<br>mathematic so I pick my I pick my target<br>so I went to see um this uh student who<br>are C PhD student and then I sit beside<br>them and wait for them to have time and<br>show me how to dissolve this solve this<br>equation that equation and know there<br>make it so a lot of a challenge actually<br>but it was really worth it communication<br>skill with supervisor with stuff delated<br>to research uh also with peer and friend<br>and that was the time I started watching<br>football actually this is also have a<br>motive behind because the store manager<br>we were given 400 like some some sort of<br>press account in in unity Oakland this<br>day and then um it wasn't enough<br>sometime so I found the store manager<br>that his name it's incredible friendly<br>if he started talking about football he<br>will give me some chemical free of chge<br>know and the grass bow is the same thing<br>uncle Stan I call him it's the same<br>thing we talk about football and things<br>like that and then say okay I will make<br>your column faster and I make sure you<br>got it after two weeks so I I managed to<br>squeeze into the queue thanks God so<br>this is how I I get things done with a<br>soccer and being independent is very<br>important as well like<br>financially yeah U The Confident I get<br>self reliant decision making and I also<br>developed new hobby I have no time to<br>pain anymore then I start learning<br>taking photography with my husband give<br>me a a nice camera I start making taking<br>photo I developed lifelong friendship<br>and you can see here the people from my<br>lab uh from Ireland Czech Republic Spain<br>UK French and this is from Nigeria yeah<br>and some of us are still keeping in<br>touch and here they are enjoying the K<br>cook by me<br>yeah then I'm going to talk about<br>transition during<br>ecomic so my first job after PhD um was<br>a junior research scientist at the<br>standard and Industrial Research<br>Institute Malaysia this is a a very<br>pretty relaxed environment 845 to 445<br>nobody work over time and before 4 to 45<br>everybody kill out in front of the the<br>the machine to punch cut and the job<br>actually deal with wastewater treatment<br>many contract research from industry<br>involve a lot of routine testing<br>bored so I was looking for something<br>more intellectually challenging yeah so<br>very lucky me in year 2000 I was offer a<br>lecturer<br>position in a faculty of Food Science<br>and<br>biotechnology um in the Unis Putra<br>Malaysia so this is not a typo I want to<br>say yeah it's a Malay spelling of the<br>University yeah and at the time the de<br>is a professor gulam Pier here he T to<br>me he he said um wow we have too many um<br>you know younger staff in biotechnology<br>I want you to consider to join food<br>science department and I was saying well<br>based on my research background I'm more<br>suited to the biochem uh biotechnology<br>Department then you say well okay qu<br>tell you what if you can gain a PhD with<br>your<br>biochemistry background I strongly<br>believe you can adapt to the food<br>science and technology research area and<br>this is how and he gave me this uh food<br>chemistry PHA to read and after<br>consideration I say yes to him and this<br>is how I started as a lecturer and uh<br>they give me things like um food<br>analysis um nutritional changes in food<br>processing which I start with with and<br>after 2 years one of my colleague went<br>on a maternity leave and I was trusted<br>with the cost called food<br>chemistry and de I feel this is a dream<br>job I want because um I believe in<br>education a Gateway changing the job are<br>changing the world<br>actually and upm actually has a best<br>theary program in Malaysia in term of<br>Food Science and Technology and it's<br>established in 1976 and you can see the<br>global ranking in 20221 it's pretty<br>high these are the colleague I have in U<br>uh some of my colleagues I have in uh<br>during that time and some celebration<br>students so what is food science and why<br>it<br>matter I start learning food science a<br>study about physical of physical<br>biological and chemical makeup of food<br>and the concept underlying food<br>processing and uh this is obviously more<br>than cooking and food handling and food<br>technology is an application of Food<br>Science to the selection preservation<br>processing packaging distribution and<br>use of safe food and if you look at the<br>Institute of food technology back um<br>website they say food size is essential<br>to ensure our food supply is safe<br>nutritious taste good economical<br>sustainable and at upm it give me very<br>uh good experience about the F size<br>curriculum I was um serving in um I I<br>serve in the curriculum committee after<br>uh two years and from here you can see<br>food size curriculum is a very<br>multidisiplinary<br>these are the three agency which give<br>accreditation for food science um<br>subject you can see chemistry<br>engineering microbiology sensory science<br>uh safety uh actually appear in all this<br>ACC<br>Edition<br>then exciting in 2004 I moved to Unity<br>oan so this is a a place everybody most<br>of my colleag here are familiar with<br>anyway I got a lecturer in food science<br>in the Department of Chemistry then and<br>um in the new food science program which<br>is established in<br>1997 so here I'm having Professor LLY<br>Milton the founding director he couldn't<br>be here today because um he was not very<br>well so he this morning I feel a bit uh<br>sorry anyway he couldn't come<br>but he has been the one who um started<br>the program and in 1997 we have the<br>first batch of postgraduate diploma<br>master and PhD<br>student and then in 2002 we have the<br>first batch of BSC food science but<br>because at the time we didn't have first<br>year paper therefore the student only<br>came to us in 2003 and I joined in 2004<br>just in time to develop<br>um two important third year courses<br>which is a sensory science and food<br>product<br>development so this is the first B<br>student we have back in 2004 there are<br>only 10 student in the sensory class so<br>it's actually a very uh valuable photo<br>we have ke we have kept at the time we<br>only have three permanent academic staff<br>Lori and then my colleague uh bronan<br>here and myself we have<br>um um we have some contract staff who<br>has contribut to our program um after a<br>few years like Professor conr<br>P yeah and um um R Stevenson Dr Peter<br>swetland who has come and teach and help<br>us in our<br>teaching there's something I'd like to<br>highlight in my teaching of uh uh food<br>science in University of O is about the<br>food product development<br>cost from the enrollment of in 2004 we<br>have the enrollment of 47 in<br>2020 when this course was turned into a<br>Capstone course yeah so the course<br>cultivate Innovation preservation skill<br>teamw Spirit preparing student for the<br>food industry and the student have to<br>use um their knowledge they learn from<br>second year third year to make a food<br>prototype product and present to judge<br>here you can see on the day of<br>presentation I have uh been very well<br>supported by industry judges here<br>Dave thanks Dave he's here in the<br>audience today and uh like Paul Harrison<br>sensan yeah and also uh this is lecture<br>and there are many industry people will<br>help me in this process and I would they<br>see the they say the industry support<br>from New Zealand food industry is just<br>incredible I have free ingredient I have<br>ingredient Workshop organized with the<br>help with company like sensan uh<br>ingredion dupon yeah Hawkings W I have<br>threee ingredient for project I have a<br>product judging and feedback for my<br>student and uh Hawkings SW is a company<br>who set up a food product development<br>price for our student as<br>well so here you can see the food New<br>Zealand which is the official Journal of<br>the food science and technology<br>Institute in uh this<br>November um December issue in 20<br>6 reporting about our batch of food<br>technology from Unity o and this is<br>really a very good promotion for us and<br>thanks to Dave for writing that<br>article yeah and uh with this patient<br>for teaching I won teaching award in<br>2007 um and also over years I have<br>helped students in their product<br>development and we wanton some prices<br>like velocity Innovation Challenge I for<br>international Union of food science<br>price back to the food science program<br>in the mstone in 2012 we have the<br>Bachelor of Food Science and nutrition<br>program and now there are two pathway<br>for student student have the nutrition<br>pathway and also the food science<br>pathway and we are well supported by the<br>nutrition in the faculty of medical and<br>Health Sciences as a feeding program for<br>their master of dtic uh program in 2015<br>I become the director of Food Science<br>there are lots of challenges at the time<br>for the undergraduate and postgraduate<br>program the changes the expansion<br>sortage of stuff and this is like a<br>chicken 18 because you want extra stuff<br>but then we have to to grow the number<br>to get the stuff so while growing the<br>number of course we have a extra job to<br>do in 2016 we have um have the our first<br>teaching fellow Dr swetland uh Dr Peter<br>swetland joined us and 2017 we have the<br>first year paper and this is a<br>significant Milestone because for many<br>years we never have a first year full<br>science paper and the second year paper<br>changed to so that we are um consistent<br>with the nutrition pathway student and<br>this also we get good support from the<br>nutrition in the faculty of medical and<br>Health Sciences in 2019 I have a new new<br>colleague who has microbiology<br>background Dr Kang hang and he developed<br>a small microbiology lab and this is an<br>mous phone and in 2021 and 22 20 and 22<br>we are lucky to have another two staff<br>to join us which is Dr David and Dr Dar<br>Lon sitting in the audience and then in<br>2022 we have the master of f sign talk<br>course this is also another major mstone<br>and if you look at the<br>enrollment we have been doing well and<br>affected by uh covid this is a time I<br>take over and the number keep going<br>until we hit we were hit by the co and<br>now actually it's speaking up again this<br>is showing the full sign of completion<br>the number of student in uh of graduated<br>yeah also a a good curve and hopefully<br>go<br>up in of international ranking we are<br>proud to say that the program is now<br>doing very well and we rank 38 uh<br>according to Shanghai ranking compared<br>to in 2017 we are in 51 and 75 and uh in<br>another ranking new US news we have a 72<br>um internal ranking this is the highest<br>in New Zealand uh all the food science<br>program and of course this uh success<br>wouldn't come uh without effort so many<br>people have contribute to this including<br>the support of the department the school<br>the support of the faculty the<br>university and the effort of the staff<br>um students who are working hard to make<br>the reputation in the food industry so I<br>consider everybody have a piece of Dix<br>so puzzle and without everybody's effort<br>this will never happen therefore I<br>really like to take this opportunity to<br>thanks all my colleagues students all my<br>my um colleague in food science for<br>their effort to make this happen and<br>hopefully we can be stronger and<br>research so here it's showing that in<br>the last 10 years I'm actually um my<br>role is mainly as a last author<br>co-author because I believe all the<br>student were the younger researcher or<br>emerging researcher it should be the<br>first<br>author<br>and if you look at this um inm of<br>breakdown by article most of my<br>publication is research article which is<br>um about<br>88% and uh a fraction of review 8% book<br>chapter about 3% and<br>others if if I look at by publication by<br>Journal it's a very significant number<br>is on the food chemistry which is the<br>top journal in food chemistry area with<br>the impact factor of 9 I check it's<br>9.23 and also Journal of food<br>engineering which is a top area in food<br>engineering and uh others and also other<br>Pap here's publication in uh other<br>Journal this is my fav<br>diagram this one show the area of<br>publication my research work is<br>associated with so you can see here most<br>of my publication is from the<br>Agricultural and biological science<br>which is a about<br>43% and uh chemistry<br>16.32% biochemistry 9 about 10%<br>engineering five chemical engineering I<br>don't know why they don't group this<br>together yeah and Immunology social<br>science pharmacology environmental<br>science health profession uh interesting<br>mexon nursing energy Neal science<br>psychology arts and Humanity business<br>economy and physics so it's a very good<br>defraction of the multi-disciplinary<br>actually so little bit about my research<br>interest I try to integrate my knowledge<br>in Biochemistry food science and<br>engineering into a researching food<br>property and functionality their<br>processing aspect and also the<br>development of food product for health<br>benefit and consumer enjoyment basically<br>I can classify my research into three<br>area which is a first one is the<br>functional ingredient and bioactive<br>where I do extraction characterization<br>evaluation of a bioactive and functional<br>ingredient and then develop um delivery<br>system through<br>encapsulation I look at product<br>development and uh recently I look at<br>alternative protein and the second area<br>in food processing quality and safety<br>where main focus is on the property of<br>the food uh and the process uh and the<br>processing and flavor development and<br>modification for sensory and fomic<br>approaches the other thing is using<br>waste by product for all this uh<br>research and finally is the food depit<br>which I look at oxidation and the depit<br>quality which is um relatively minor<br>compared to the other two reason the<br>other two<br>area and diding my day in upm I have a<br>chance to join this uh program called a<br>jaica<br>um International collaboration agencies<br>um young researcher development program<br>and I have a chance to go to Yamaguchi<br>University for three months for training<br>and I work on separation of carotin from<br>red palm oil using adoption cometography<br>the professor yamam yamam so here is a<br>very kind man in addition to research he<br>has also um give me opportunity to<br>attend seminar um seminar simple Sim in<br>a different city so I I took the<br>opportunity and travel around actually<br>so been to Kyoto been to Nara Osaka I to<br>Hiroshima at least these three very<br>beautiful<br>city so this project actually helped me<br>Malaysia so Dr Buu or Buu is my first<br>PhD uh student in uh University P<br>Malaysia and I'm lucky to have a um my<br>colleague bisa who is a very uh very uh<br>helpful colleagues who who help to uh<br>develop this project and we co super as<br>a student so why we look at this Palm<br>fatty acid<br>distilling this is actually a byproduct<br>from Palm Oil processing so after the CR<br>palm oil they finally we get about 5% of<br>this um soal Palm fatty acid distillate<br>and the very interesting thing about<br>this is they have a very<br>high vitamin E content yeah so we are<br>trying to separate this vitamin E<br>content from this waste product and then<br>the waste product can be used as animal<br>Feit uh or can be used in the aoch<br>chemical uh industry making soap for<br>example<br>yeah so vitamin E have many forms many<br>you can say too tooer and<br>toino the main part of the vitamin E in<br>this uh uh palm palm fatty acid is here<br>is actually in the too trino form which<br>is a more po antioxidant compared to the<br>too fero yeah um they have also<br>something like<br>anti-cancer uh neural protection effect<br>lower um cholesterol um also trying to<br>help with breast sugar and things like<br>that lots of benefit and people have<br>studyed about that we are trying to work<br>on the method which is uh using less<br>capital investment energy saving and<br>using M processing condition so we come<br>up with entic hysis neutralization and<br>using aborption<br>craphy we published some paper we<br>received some some awards for the for<br>the projects including the go matter at<br>the international exhibtion of process<br>Innovation<br>Geneva and uh this work also helped me<br>in my subsequent work in Oakland looking<br>at adoption isot separation of<br>juice then in the at the unity of U FIA<br>I'm also very lucky to join Professor<br>nazima Hamed she's also here today uh on<br>the tropical fruit research and we look<br>at spray drying fish drying drum drying<br>we look at Post hours minimally<br>processing solid stability<br>we evalate the physical chemical<br>property flavor microbiological safety<br>sensory property and uh we we produced<br>three Master student these are the three<br>Master student I have initially with uh<br>Dr nzima so yigang is already become the<br>head of technical service in no time and<br>suong is a as a research scientist in<br>Australia National phenon Center and I<br>haven't get in touch with the other<br>student between at catch up and see what<br>it's doing now so these are the paper we<br>are publishing we have<br>published then exciting<br>thing after I join Unity oan because you<br>are only three staff I have a lot of<br>teaching 250 hours contact time is a nor<br>and I was very dedicated to develop<br>material teaching material uh cost and<br>things like that I hardly find time to<br>develop a sound research project only<br>after three years I successfully attract<br>a students um she later become my<br>colleague in a full Science Program Dr<br>Dan nson a outstanding and outstanding<br>BSC honor student to work with<br>me so Dan look at um effect of thermal<br>processing on the property of New<br>salon and I'm lucky to have a Dr lawren<br>here um he's um very famous the chemist<br>in New Zealand to support me in the<br>super super uh supervisor as a<br>co-supervisor in the<br>project so we just choose the method the<br>processing method which December common<br>cooking method for uh for seeing the<br>effect of the termal processing on King<br>salon and the project is supported by<br>New Zealand King sumon so here you can<br>see uh Dan has chose porch steam<br>microwave bit pen flight deep flight as<br>a common method and uh we analyze the<br>fatty acid dist distribution de content<br>uh micro micr structure changes using<br>some noal non-destructive method like<br>using MRI as you see here also she's<br>using environmental electron<br>microscopy she has trying to corate the<br>instrumental uh measurement with the<br>sensory panels data<br>yeah and from here<br>New Zealand King suon company actually<br>obtained some very useful data for them<br>so from the the research we can very<br>comfortably say if you take 100 gr of<br>king salmon you cook it um you should<br>have more than enough of omega-3 fatty<br>acid for your diet regardless of cooking<br>method yeah with one exception maybe is<br>a it's a deep fry where oil is used and<br>increase the ratio of the Omega 6 fatty<br>acid which is not not good um in the in<br>the product but if we use por steam<br>fine anyway the next thing is about food<br>powder you may wonder why I study fot<br>powder actually this is one of the major<br>part of my research so the reason is<br>being if you have um say juice we have t<br>of juice but if it's spray dry we reduce<br>the water and you you deduce the weight<br>of the final product the same with milk<br>as well you turn into milk powder you<br>get deduction of a weight and volume<br>easy<br>Transportation easily used in the food<br>product they give a better stability and<br>shelf life and the other reason is I I'm<br>working with micro encapsulation of a<br>functional ingredient which is like I<br>normally turn the product into food<br>powder as well so little bit about mro<br>encapsulation where you can see here we<br>have metric and then we trying to use<br>some um cover or War material to<br>encapsulate this matric which is like<br>bioactive compound like omega-3 fatty<br>acid vitamin flavors whatever we want to<br>encapsulate and then we protect the<br>ingredient and then this ingredient can<br>be added in product and then delas when<br>we digest the food<br>product so the reason for encapsulation<br>is normally the mat or the the material<br>this material are having some say very<br>bitter bitter taste like for example<br>this uh polyphenol is bitter therefore<br>we want to encapsulate it otherwise<br>consumer cannot<br>accept if you add polyol straight away<br>into food product it's too bitter yeah<br>and also something with fishy oo like um<br>fish oil and things like that uh we need<br>to encapsulate to minimize the<br>unpleasant order a lot of metal has been<br>used spray drying Extrusion<br>cation um are common method or even fish<br>drying and they use in different<br>product this is the F first work first<br>work I have uh on food powder and<br>publication at the University of oan is<br>about watermelon<br>powder and King is a student who is<br>doing a actually a small project on<br>postgraduate diploma project but because<br>I didn't have any student at the time I<br>took extra effort to go to the lab and<br>make extra experiment and endal they I<br>publish this paper it's too desperate<br>for paper for a young<br>acemic yeah and um Dr Peter S is helping<br>me in a technical uh thing and he called<br>to this paper and amazing is like I feel<br>this paper is just a pretty normal but<br>it get a very good citation yeah one of<br>the reason I figure out is because not<br>many people are doing this sort of work<br>at the time so if you're pioneer you get<br>the<br>rewards<br>yeah this this saw the list of project I<br>have I have a um work on on food powder<br>see from watermelon fish oil M food some<br>fruit product like Mandarin Cambry<br>fedra and also Esten vitamin E coq0 this<br>one from the food powder uh research I<br>have a G three very important um three<br>very important um achievement one is<br>about coencapsulation of a of a<br>ingredient this is very important<br>concept at the time not many people<br>talking about Co encapsulation and I was<br>one of the first who said yes if you put<br>a few um ingredient together they can<br>form synergestic effect and they give a<br>better health effect and therefore we<br>make all them together and here I'm<br>trying to uh um and my student and the<br>group trying to encapsulate fish oil<br>with fytoo loline and you can see the<br>oxidation become better one encapsulated<br>we do a sensory evation we put this in<br>well I don't have much time so I have to<br>go<br>faster yeah and the second thing is the<br>knowledge in a microcapsule particle<br>formation it's very common in um in a<br>particle formation in encapsulation we<br>get this spray dryer and we don't know<br>what happened we get the powder so<br>actually what happened here from the fit<br>solution you get the powder we can't do<br>sampling in between therefore you don't<br>know what to do or what is the science<br>here and um I found this professor um he<br>used to work in University of oan he<br>work on milk powder Professor donen he<br>has a paper pish on milk powder and he's<br>using this setup called single drop<br>drying trying to dry one single droplet<br>to see how this droplet can be dry and<br>he follow the whole history of the<br>drying here there's a camera and here<br>there's a temperature prop for drying<br>and uh we hang one single drop off uh<br>sample here so it's really a very um how<br>to say tedious work and the student have<br>to have a very steady hand and uh free<br>of vibration so they can successfully<br>hang one drop of a drop that to see what<br>happened in dry so this student working<br>on cranberry juice and she first<br>produced some uh some photo to show us<br>what happened with different time going<br>on what happened in the drying how the<br>particle form and how they they strange<br>thease water and things like that she<br>also put a drop of water on the Dred<br>particle and then trying to see how this<br>particle dissolve turn turn back into<br>the juice yeah and then we can use uh<br>engineering modeling uh trying to see<br>the kinetic and uh predict the particle<br>formation so another another student is<br>doing taking this Fu and he's working on<br>non<br>juice then he's trying to predict the<br>drying and trying to come up with a<br>mechanism of drying saying there are<br>three stages of drying for this uh non<br>juice from the first isotropic drying to<br>cast formation and then solidification<br>so on anyway I don't want to go too much<br>here no time and then also he can delate<br>it to the bioactivity of the powder and<br>also delate to the flavor of the flavor<br>Detention of the product actually in<br>this case is like the oo actually uh we<br>don't want the smell of the the the the<br>product which is a pretty awful the<br>third thing is about um mono disper<br>particle we are thinking if the particle<br>can be uniform in size we might be able<br>to predict the loading of the uh say the<br>ingredient inside the particle and uh<br>the same with Professor donen he<br>designed a a dryer for me here which is<br>a a SoCal um microfic jet spray drying<br>which is like you can imagine it's like<br>tap water when you have water drop drop<br>drop drop that yeah and then in the<br>process you have a hot a dry the<br>particle then we have uniform particle<br>form and uh Yong uh y Yong is um Yong is<br>working on the project and<br>uh he's um making a very good progress<br>on the uh project and in order to<br>increase the throughput you imagine if<br>you only use one tape water you only<br>have one line of particle you can<br>actually have multiple noer so you have<br>a multiple uh multiple um particle<br>drying at the same time<br>so here showing the vitamin E and also<br>the coqen powder using this method by uh<br>Master student elain and Yong<br>Jun and these are the new project I'm<br>working on the more recent project using<br>noic acid which is good for brain health<br>and we encapsulate with<br>a uh phosphor liid to increase the bio<br>availability and we make it into a nano<br>these are the two student working in the<br>project J and also uh<br>Yen and then it's the probiotic<br>encapsulation where we use a p extract<br>trying to encapsulate probiotic and then<br>making them<br>um<br>more I mean High longer shelf life so<br>it's like what extract you can add in<br>the probiotic to help the probiotic<br>survive and then you encapsulate them<br>using some of the ingredient here like H<br>protein PE protein whe protein anything<br>and evaluate how much the probiotic can<br>still survive so this is ongoing<br>research sponsored by<br>Ren and then I also work with bioactive<br>compound we use initro chemical and<br>cell-based antioxidant aay uh<br>inflamatory aay anti-cancer aay gene<br>expression and proteomic study and I got<br>a lot of support from my colleagues on<br>all this method especially from medical<br>school and uh these are the project we<br>are working on we have actually um<br>working on and finish all this project<br>one of the project in particular I like<br>to mention a little bit is about this uh<br>mushroom project which is a indigenous<br>mushroom so this mushroom is<br>interesting at the time we study we<br>don't know what the species of the<br>mushroom yeah we know it's a helium and<br>hel<br>actually is well studied they have a<br>popular curin called helium ensus which<br>is a having a lot of anti-cancer neural<br>protection antioxidant activity and very<br>well studyed but the New Zealand species<br>has not been studied so throughout the<br>study we have managed to um uh get um an<br>expert to uh do<br>philogenetic DNA andal sequencing things<br>like that and name it ASM Nova this is a<br>new spe<br>we publish quite a number of paper we<br>identify a few compound which is U very<br>specific to this species and also some<br>nucleoside compound which is good in<br>immune<br>system so I just have to rush through<br>sorry and also we have some uh uh<br>vitamin E vitamin D precursor and uh<br>looking at the def defic fraction and<br>predict the mechanism action trying to<br>see how they involved in uh curing the<br>anti-inflammatory so very interestingly<br>is like we found this research we have<br>worked on here you can see all our paper<br>published has been used by company to to<br>sell their product online and I just<br>pick up this one yeah they say they have<br>done study and I go and have a look it's<br>all the study we have done with my<br>student uh Grace chain<br>we have a good help from people for this<br>project including a professor from Japan<br>journalist joury giving us the<br>the the reference reference for<br>analyzing analysis otherwise you can we<br>cannot de Identify some of the<br>flavor so this is a combination of order<br>and taste that create the designable<br>perception so in fact flavor perception<br>is most of the multi- sensory experience<br>in our everyday experience we need to to<br>to use our visual taste smell touch and<br>healing to um to give the whole<br>perception of<br>flavor so when we study flavor chemistry<br>we study the compound that elicit a<br>flavor sensation produce from chemical<br>compound reacting with the receptor with<br>in our mouth and also the Nal cavity<br>and this can be something we taste<br>tasting like sweet sour bitter salty<br>Umami and some Aroma we can smell and<br>every Aroma have a specific specific<br>smell um according to their uh chemical<br>here and then in addition there's<br>another compound which is called bound W<br>compound which is very useful as well<br>they probably wouldn't give a taste of<br>flavor sorry by itself because they are<br>bound to a sugar this is aroma compound<br>bound to sugar and it need to be cut and<br>released to give the aroma but why this<br>is important is because this two um free<br>ver and the bound veral give um together<br>give a balance of the the flavor of a<br>fruits and these are the fruit that have<br>a gyc bound veral<br>compound so we studied the gcos bound<br>compound of kiwi fruit the very small Ki<br>fruit called aguta yeah and also Tamaro<br>we also predict their biochemical<br>pathway and these are some of other<br>compound we have studied for the flavor<br>project then a bit about International<br>collaboration actually on the product<br>development this is a very interesting<br>place called U UN in<br>China and through the formalization with<br>the unity Oran between the UN and un<br>Services I have been given money to do<br>consultation for them and uh I have uh<br>visited the place a few time also<br>bringing my colleagues from industry<br>there um involved in the product judging<br>and uh building collaboration with uh<br>other Professor from other country in<br>selenium space station like here with uh<br>Dr mial we developed something like um<br>astr rice product green tea powder and<br>uh we also do uh selenium Rich<br>ingredient like conj<br>for Noodle and there are a lot of<br>product and some of them are already in<br>the<br>market and then the next product<br>development project I like to highlight<br>is a food for dispy which is for some<br>people who have a difficulty in<br>swallowing and this is a project<br>sponsored by a company called Pure Food<br>Company with K Innovation and<br>uh is uh coming to the end for the by<br>shika<br>moving forward it's like we know<br>ethically everyone everywhere should<br>deserve to have a safe nutritionist<br>nutritious food that does not cough the<br>Earth but the issue is uh 2.4 million<br>people struggle to get regular access to<br>sufficient food and more more than a<br>third of all food is lost or wasted in<br>the<br>process either lost in a like developed<br>country these are all the finished<br>product already but because of the<br>expired or it get throw away and uh they<br>are they are wasted and in term of some<br>underdeveloped or developing country is<br>because of the um drought uh or some P<br>or some uh spage issue the food is lost<br>and the other issue is everybody know is<br>about the uh<br>emission and the climate change<br>issue so if you look at New Zealand it's<br>about half of the agricultureal<br>um the greenhouse gas is from the<br>agricultural<br>sector when we look at the the of food<br>product you can see the pl product give<br>more<br>um environmental impact therefore now I<br>have a very quick I have some project<br>working on this extent to<br>um innal sustainability to to solve the<br>issue one is looking at the<br>LIF from B from cabbage and relish and<br>this is one of the specialist which is<br>not in in uh New Zealand but we got it<br>from China they are all basa Leaf why we<br>study basa Leaf because they produce<br>biomass very fast and then they also<br>wasted a lot of a lot of waste from<br>these products half of 50% of the<br>produce are wasted you imagine we eat<br>the buy bu we don't eat a leaf is it<br>yeah so we looking at extracting protein<br>we look at the uh health benefit<br>antioxidant aay uh anti- cancer property<br>and things like that for this project<br>the student just passed last week<br>without correction so happy for<br>her and the next student working on hand<br>isolate basically we look at the<br>processing method and how it affect the<br>property of the protein we have a<br>proteomic study we also have bioactivity<br>prediction and validation and some of<br>the work has<br>published the next stent work on the<br>plant extract and see and essential oil<br>and see how they can be used as a meat<br>preservative natural preservative so<br>she's looking at a synergestic<br>antimicrobial interaction trying to<br>apply in meat product and do invo study<br>using animal looking at G microbiome is<br>this going to be affected by the natural<br>preservative and then next is the new<br>project from U two student on mushroom<br>and on insect protein<br>then very fast this is a MB project in<br>wolfing using CIT where we collaborate<br>with Singapore in the future food<br>research program which is going to<br>conclude this<br>year and I recently involved with uh<br>professor paultin in the project and<br>also my other colleagues from uh<br>chemical sciences and aut and cion in<br>ways to treasure project using noval<br>chemistry to uze residual PL material<br>and my part is looking at the gra<br>promise<br>prot and these are some other these are<br>the other<br>um product we aim to achieve in this<br>project so this is a five years<br>project then I'm now um become the<br>co-author in Chief in this journal<br>dedicated to sustainability actually S<br>2000 invited by Elia and we are doing we<br>have been doing well with the first<br>impact factor 5.7 last year if you have<br>any paper for this please support<br>us and finally it's a uh future food<br>Research Center in view of the<br>importance of food sustainability I have<br>um um anyway collaborate with my other<br>colleagues in uh medical school and also<br>engineering and we set up this Center<br>Under The Faculty of Science and we have<br>a a very good support from U different<br>colleagues from other faculty and from<br>Arts Angus uh Amber from uh Medical<br>School Emma environmental<br>Sally um Jennifer from nutrition and<br>Professor bang for<br>engineering so we aim to improve food<br>and nutrition security and hopefully we<br>can achieve something um after a few<br>years<br>hopefully so finally is the deflection<br>about my experience as EIC this is the<br>last SL I<br>promise so no degrade at all to be<br>friend because I'm doing the job I love<br>this is a meaningful job because I work<br>young adult I can bring young people to<br>the world of knowledge I shape the next<br>generation of the society and I'm always<br>young at heart because I'm dealing with<br>all these young people and my student<br>give me a nickname so young This Is How<br>They call me yeah as usual nothing is<br>perfect multitasking is perfect the<br>biggest challenge I I I face working<br>long hour and the work life balance<br>where my husband say when can you stop<br>working on<br>Saturday anyway I try to<br>yeah and uh dealing with a s people with<br>difficult<br>personality<br>anyway if you view this as a job it's is<br>quite a demanding job but it's<br>challenging yeah um if you want to go<br>fast my experience this is for younger<br>younger uh student who wanting to become<br>academic one day you go by yourself you<br>walk fast you can go very fast if you<br>want to go far go with a team like the<br>research program I'm now joining in the<br>impact and then we focus this is also<br>for the student who want to be a one day<br>success wouldn't come without effort but<br>without one everything else is zero is<br>true yeah so thanks so much um I dearly<br>owe this uh appreciation to many people<br>that make my journey who have supported<br>me throughout this years all student<br>have supervised and co- super and taugh<br>who have shared the Journey of my<br>research and development as a teacher<br>the research collaborator at Unity payia<br>University of Oakland and all<br>International collaborator special<br>thanks to professor gulam and also<br>nazima for daily giving me great support<br>and start my food science career<br>colleagues at University of oan uh food<br>science program School of chemical<br>Sciences who have supported me<br>throughout the years technical staff<br>without them students experiment cannot<br>go through um a special thanks to S<br>forood industry Peer who have given<br>their invariable time do all this<br>Workshop you know support student and uh<br>also very special thanks to um
