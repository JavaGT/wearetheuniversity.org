Globally, tensions, populism, intolerance and racism are on the rise and calls for monolingualism seem to follow. Post-pandemic, education systems and institutions are struggling to get students back into class and to achieve basic reading and math skills in one language. Climate-related events regularly disrupt teaching and learning. And equity and equality for girls and others remain a challenge. So why should we invest time, effort and funding into preserving, revitalizing, promoting and legally protecting mother languages? This lecture reflects on the transformative potential of Pacific mother languages from Moananuiākea (the Pacific) in Aotearoa New Zealand. It explores complexities and implications for indigenous peoples, human rights, climate change, and the future of work. The discussion departs from notions about the ‘mother’ aspect of such languages and explores the crucial role of wahine.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may

for<br>coming<br>along<br>um uh I guess I've I've already had a<br>really lovely introduction so I don't<br>need to say anything about those things<br>um but I'm really glad to be here today<br>languages are um close to my heart um<br>probably just uh by way of placing<br>myself within the context of this<br>conversation um my grandparents uh in<br>Hawaii were the generation that grew up<br>um uh and my mother actually having the<br>law prohibit the use of Hawaiian in<br>public spaces including schools uh my<br>grandparents spoke Hawaiian olelo Havi<br>um at home fluently and they would speak<br>to each other and their brothers and<br>sisters um and others uh in that<br>language uh but my mother and her<br>siblings um growing up in Hawaii in the<br>1950s and 60s do do not speak<br>fluently it's something that bothers<br>them it's something um that is kind of<br>hard um and in<br>1978 um John W uh like one of our first<br>native Hawaiian governors in Hawaii um<br>was part of a movement to uh amend the<br>Constitution in the state of Hawaii to<br>um uh really to make sure that Hawaiian<br>language was was taught in schools um<br>and and it but it wasn't until the early<br>1980s that that law was actually<br>repealed<br>so um I come to this um as an adult<br>who's um learning and I don't come to<br>this as a Linguistics person specialist<br>I come to this as a legal scholar with h<br>you know who dabbles and some other<br>things um and and um from from working<br>with Pacific people and communities and<br>um and and in education spaces but thank<br>you so much Mahal so uh I just want to<br>get started<br>um by talking uh about a really special<br>lady so um<br>um so the the people of Hawaii and<br>kanaka Mali kanaki people and kakali<br>means kind of like Mai like you're the<br>regular people of of that country um I<br>prefer kanako iwi because it means that<br>we're come from the bones of those<br>people it's like e the word ewi here um<br>and it means that your genealogy your<br> or your Mo AO comes from Hawaii so<br>um so kanaka uh Mai kanako iwi people<br>owe a lot to um this lovely lady her<br>name um is Mary cavena pukui um over the<br>course of her lifetime she would write<br>she would uh research and write and<br>publish and and then update and amend<br>and publish again some of the most<br>important<br>um kind of reservoirs or repositories of<br>Hawaiian language that we have<br>today um so um in in kind of the<br>interest of today I I thought of her as<br>a mother of<br>languages<br>um and uh so she was this in many ways<br>she was a scholar a<br>linguist um a composer a translator she<br>she was a kumu hula or a hoola teacher<br>um and and really a h hola master um her<br>body of work included more than 50 books<br>that she wrote or co-authored in more<br>than 150<br>songs um and it's been described as the<br>backbone of Hawaiian culture and<br>language uh significantly contributing<br>to um the preservation and<br>revitalization efforts of kanakam Mali<br>so so this body of Works um includes um<br>as I said a dictionary um a book on<br>grammar um and then the Hawaiian<br>Proverbs and poetical says which we<br>call um one of the ones I really love is<br>is this one<br>Leo<br>or um akah hav so um great and numerous<br>is the knowledge of the<br>Hawaiians um and um uh today I'll kind<br>of propose that great and numerous as<br>the knowledge a Pacific Civic peoples um<br>which just as we see here is contained<br>in<br>language so<br>um um I feel really inspired by by this<br>uh by her work um and um even um to the<br>point where she has these she's<br>collected Olo noo um that place you<br>right where your ancestors came from so<br>um if you look through heard<br>2,41 or however many ol no are in this<br>volume um there's even one for La where<br>you know where our family comes from or<br>one of the places where our family comes<br>from um which which talks about um the<br>twin girls that La is named after and<br>talks about La II um who was the the<br>twin that got taken away and trained by<br>a tuna right um our our word is Kahuna<br>so<br>they're quite amazing and that's the AA<br>that that I associate with so um pukui<br>was a fluent speaker of ol hav and<br>that's really important uh she uh was<br>raised in a family who passed down<br>volumes of knowledge um in this oral<br>tradition to pukui um and throughout<br>these volumes and others one is struck<br>by the extraordinary breadth of her<br>knowledge um the painstaking efforts and<br>sacrifices that it must have required um<br>to put those volumes together um she<br>literally had to just go around and talk<br>to people um about their local ol no<br>right um it's quite quite extraordinary<br>so she she visited everyone in every<br>island um so her commitment to ensuring<br>that our culture our language and our<br>history um would continue as quite<br>apparent and she was still contributing<br>to this work into her 90s so um I think<br>the most recent addition of the old no<br>book is uh in the night is like 1986 and<br>she would have been like about 90 at<br>that time so it's quite<br>extraordinary um now in the forward to<br>this 1986 Edition um a close colleague<br>and friend of pukui described her in<br>this way um quote she makes us a gift of<br>the lay of knowledge that she has spent<br>so long collecting unquote in Hawaii and<br>other places in Moana Nui AA the Pacific<br>area the Pacific Ocean um in places such<br>as the Cook Islands um lays are a gift<br>um the uh one of the last uh probably<br>the yeah two two trips ago um one of my<br>cousins um who who lives there sent her<br>husband to an outer Island um to gather<br>Miley Hawaiians love Miley and it's this<br>very fragrant plant you don't even love<br>it because of the flowers you love it<br>because the leaves are fragrant um and<br>her husband went to another uh Island to<br>get those uh for me uh for my visit and<br>so the whole trip I had this lay sitting<br>in my hotel room with this beautiful<br>smell of Miley and you don't take that<br>and just lightly throw it in the rubbish<br>when you're done you stick that into the<br>refrigerator um every chance you get so<br>that it will last um and uh because<br>someone has made that for you they've<br>gathered those things for you and<br>they've made made that for you and it's<br>very<br>precious and he knew uh he knew that<br>Hines love Miley good Miley it was<br>better than our Miley but I Tred not to<br>tell my mom that okay um so so so when<br>pukui is described in this way um I I<br>propose that it's because of a couple<br>things one uh she her gift is such a<br>treasure uh she is herself a gift and a<br>treasure um but what she presented us to<br>through the Hawaiian language um is<br>quite a gift and a treasure<br>too um so I'd like to talk more about<br>that<br>um uh today I hope to share a few<br>thoughts on the gift of the lay of<br>knowledge that comes from mother<br>languages um mother languages are gifts<br>not least because they can teach us<br>about transformative education outcomes<br>and um as I said by way of disclaimer<br>I'm not going to approach this like a<br>ling linguist um but um but I'll share a<br>little language um yeah Mahalo um and of<br>course uh being kakali kako iwi I don't<br>represent all the diverse Pacific<br>peoples um of Mo Nu AIA um but I hope I<br>will share um what I've learned from<br>them and observing them uh these<br>wonderful people and working with them<br>so um oh and lastly I especially honor<br>our our tutus our grandmas and grandpas<br>The Mamas and the Papas and our TOA<br>experts<br>um and Scholars for their generous<br>sharing of precious<br>knowledge<br>so um mother languages issues and<br>challenges so um I don't know if you<br>guys have noticed but we're living in a<br>very complex time um I don't<br>know um and and um and and it has these<br>uh these complexities have a real impact<br>on education as we've seen over the last<br>few years so um on one hand mother<br>languages are key to transformative<br>education and inclusive<br>societies um but they are under threat<br>and frequently narrated as endangered<br>even uh by people with the best<br>intentions right um and we kind of want<br>to draw attention to the fact that those<br>languages are in danger um but if we<br>leave it at endangered we're going to<br>miss something right<br>um which is why I get to talk today all<br>right um so places like Hawaii<br>demonstrate the benefit um and and why<br>this matters right is that places like<br>Hawaii demonstrate the benefit of<br>Multicultural multiethnic and linguistic<br>societies um which um if you look at<br>some of the I think it would have been<br>three or four years ago I I believe it<br>was pre pandemic um that Hawaii for<br>instance was voted<br>um the best place for gender equality in<br>the United States um and there's been a<br>number of studies about the impact of um<br>living in a place where different<br>cultures and ethnicities and languages<br>are are accepted um right so Hawaii's<br>been studied in that way having said<br>that we live in New Zealand um and even<br>here in the WTO we're in a very<br>Multicultural multiethnic place um I<br>really love going to the base um our<br>local shopping center for those of you<br>who are zooming in um and just seeing<br>how Multicultural We are Becoming in the<br>woto and in Hamilton it's really quite<br>extraordinary um so you can hear Tagalog<br>you can hear Spanish um and on and on so<br>um on the other uh and not on the other<br>hand so New Zealand has also been<br>hospitable to Pacific languages in a way<br>like in a formal way in a way that other<br>places haven't so I think we're up to 11<br>Pacific language weeks now um and so of<br>course um uh We've benefited from models<br>of talii um and revitalization there but<br>it's extraordinary to live in a country<br>where your government recognizes<br>minority languages like that so to put<br>it into perspective the United States<br>would never do such a thing the the<br>federal government in the United States<br>would never do such a thing they have a<br>hard time accepting minority rights of<br>any kind including language rights<br>including Spanish which is now spoken by<br>a sizable chunk of their population so<br>uh some of the other neat things we've<br>seen of course is that the NCA changes<br>um as I know as um complex and<br>contentious as those have been at times<br>um those promise uh that will see more<br>pacific languages in in our NCA<br>curriculum and that students will be<br>given more credit for those so it's<br>those kinds of nuts and bolts things too<br>that are really<br>exciting but we also know I recently<br>read that pacific language fluency and<br>there's a report by treasury um just<br>last year by su led by su Thompson Su<br>Kevin Thompson um that was talking about<br>uh one of the things they found in the<br>data they were looking at is that<br>pacific language fluency is declining in<br>New Zealand which is um extraordinary<br>given all of these efforts um<br>so Studies have shown that pacific new<br>zealanders who do not speak their mother<br>language um do not feel as connected to<br>their Island culture or Community um and<br>that's an issue because many of us have<br>found in our own research that of course<br>connection to your language culture and<br>a community is a plus and it's a success<br>factor so uh like climate change<br>narratives about Pacific people our<br>languages are frequently narrated as if<br>we are an endangered species um and that<br>should bother us too because of those<br>dying race narratives from the 19th and<br>20th centuries<br>so now globally some other fun stuff<br>happening in the world um we've got some<br>uh different tensions<br>populism um intolerance and racism I was<br>watching a documentary yesterday about<br>the rise of strong men again um the<br>likes of which we've not seen um since<br>World War Two um right um well no postc<br>Colonial and um some really evil<br>dictators in different places in the<br>world right um and then World War II so<br>um along with uh some of the stuff that<br>we're seeing uh we're also seeing uh a<br>rise and C more uh so increased calls<br>for monolingualism<br>again um and we are hearing these in New<br>Zealand so the stated inent of the<br>government in regards to thari is<br>Gravely concerning the potential fate of<br>all the gains<br>um that we have made for Pacific<br>languages um will be influenced by that<br>um no doubt um and and so the Our Fate<br>remains really uncertain uh because the<br>inclusion of language and culture can<br>improve outcomes in the classroom um<br>these linguistic um threats are also<br>educational<br>threats um we've learned in the past um<br>over decades and decades and really<br>through the experiment of colonization U<br>by education um and even integration<br>that one siiz fits-all education is not<br>effective um and it's not really<br>neutral um so legal and policy efforts<br>such as the No Child Left Behind Act<br>2000 in the states um actually created<br>these perverse incentives um whereby um<br>standardized testing and your funding<br>relying on standardized testing of<br>course um led to perverse outcome were<br>minority students um and many students<br>who were different in the classroom were<br>left<br>behind<br>ironically um now monolingualism is also<br>the linguistic equivalent of the virent<br>Democracy threatening authoritarianism<br>and populism that's on the rise as I<br>said and these would be rallying cries<br>of monolingualism are full just full of<br>things that sounds like Fascism and<br>racism um and world wars so post<br>pandemic education systems and<br>institutions are struggling to get<br>students back to class and um those of<br>you who work with teachers in the<br>classroom or have been teachers in the<br>classroom know this really well um the<br>are you know uh we're we're lucky um in<br>some places to be back up to 40%<br>attendance in some of some schools in<br>some<br>areas um and then uh there is a call<br>right because of um Peace scores and<br>other achievement scores um to focus on<br>basic reading and math um which also<br>takes the focus away from things like<br>languages<br>um so we we've kind of all heard uh seen<br>these headlines as well and heard<br>promises about um basic reading and math<br>being the focus um but we're also in the<br>midst of these Wicked messy challenges<br>like climate change and we've<br>experienced the pandemic we've learned<br>some interesting things there um these<br>are challenges that fundamentally<br>threaten the human right to education<br>and in fact um I think probably in the<br>first several months of the pandemic um<br>the UN Secretary General Antonio guas um<br>basically called um the pandemic a<br>generational education or generational<br>catastrophe for Ed for the right to<br>education um and he was especially<br>worried about<br>girls<br>so<br>um uh we're also in an Information Age<br>um where by all um kind of indicators<br>our students need a certain level we<br>want everyone leaving High School um and<br>our institution to have some level of<br>stem skills especially digital skills<br>the the critical ability to sort through<br>a vast amount of information um and be<br>able to engage with that in a way that<br>that protects you and um helps you get<br>through the world right and into um<br>careers for instance that are future<br>proof um so that's some of the things<br>that we've got to think about and we<br>know from the treasury report that<br>pacific people are already getting left<br>behind in terms of those particular<br>kinds of<br>jobs so last but not least um we have um<br>the ongoing issue of equity and equality<br>for girls and women in<br>education and Pacific women um we also<br>know uh from the work of our equal um<br>Rights Commission or equal opportunities<br>commissioner um uh uh I think in 2022<br>that's when the report came out that<br>pacific women experience um the largest<br>pay Equity gaps so things like that<br>future of work um right things like that<br>future of work situation are will will<br>really magnify these disparities and<br>gaps um and uh we know that pacific uh<br>people also have these biggest<br>disparities in terms of well-being so<br>that's in the treasury report from last<br>year um now education well educated<br>women and girls and here's The Clincher<br>right where Society also misses out is<br>that educated women and girls are a<br>defining factor in the realization of<br>Human Rights and they're they're what I<br>multipliers so um so organic<br>multiplication is is this this funny<br>tendency of Human Rights um uh to<br>multiply one another and to open Bridges<br>and open doors and Gates and options um<br>in real life but on the ground as<br>something like the right to vote and be<br>uh participate in political the<br>political discussions um that happen<br>during an election will be practically<br>useless if you don't know how to read<br>and right right um and in an Information<br>Age you also have to do that in a<br>digital space and know how to do that<br>so um so what the UN and other people<br>know is that when you want to get things<br>done you get the women going even though<br>we love our T we love our um but but<br>when the UN right has has this kind ofo<br>of working with the women in a place to<br>get them going and them educated and in<br>fact um in studies um way back to 2009<br>um that talk about the double dividend<br>of gender um you can see on one hand how<br>um uh an an uneducated woman has all<br>these flow on effects for her children<br>in her community whereas an educated<br>woman will also have these wonderful<br>flow-on effects for her community so<br>um we know weird stuff like children<br>under five tend to you know live longer<br>if they're well CH so women educated<br>women I better say this properly<br>educated women tend to not have children<br>that die under the age of five stuff<br>like that right um their children tend<br>to not live under the poverty line they<br>tend not to be exploited and work in<br>dangerous work that these weird things<br>they tend not to be child soldiers weird<br>stuff which seems far away but it<br>actually that actually happens in places<br>so um so so there's really interesting<br>and Powerful um things about women that<br>we have to keep in mind when we think<br>about whether the right to education is<br>is real for women around<br>us okay so I have talked a little bit<br>about why we might want to invest uh<br>time and effort and funding um into uh<br>preserving revitalizing promoting and<br>legally protecting mother languages and<br>I really was also struck by this these<br>numbers um to think that children around<br>the world 40% of the children around the<br>world will go into a classroom where<br>they don't understand anything is the<br>height of some form of<br>discrimination um it breaches natural<br>Justice and that is just weird right<br>that's weird um it puts that child at an<br>aiori disadvantage<br>before um they pick up a pencil or open<br>a book or anything um and that's really<br>quite<br>concerning so of the 7,000 languages<br>spoken in the world um we have more than<br>a thousand I want to say more than a<br>thousand I think<br>it's it's well over a thousand but I<br>don't have the um sorry my mind's blank<br>on the exact number but there's a<br>sizable chunk of those languages that<br>that are in the Pacific so for<br>instance um in Papua New Guinea um and<br>we have a growing Papua New guine in um<br>Community here in New Zealand there's at<br>least 800 languages and that doesn't<br>count<br>dialects okay that's just<br>languages so<br>um um so as Nicholas um introduced as<br>well um these are some of the<br>considerations about why this is<br>important besides the<br>numbers um but one of the most<br>interesting things um that I that I<br>found when I was digging around unesco's<br>um documents was um that<br>monolingualism actually is linked to<br>people asking questions about the<br>relevancy of Education as a whole right<br>um and and so um part of unesco's work<br>is working on um making sure that we're<br>articulating education in a form that<br>remains relevant for Learners um so on<br>one hand we've got to um be able to show<br>Learners that there's a job at the end<br>of this like why are you doing this<br>what's at the end of it um coming out of<br>Victorian times education was a<br>privilege and and there were Generations<br>that were happy just to be able to get<br>an education just like being able to<br>come here and get a tertiary education<br>um but<br>um in a world with diverse very diverse<br>options and lots of pressure for things<br>like driving a forklift or you know<br>making quick money in a postco economy<br>where where costs are High um we've<br>we've actually got to be able to to<br>articulate our relevancy um and it's<br>really important but so does the right<br>to education so that's part of unesco's<br>work at the time as well and in fact um<br>some of the stuff they talk about is how<br>um if you walk into a classroom where<br>you don't speak the language and your<br>education is not going to be a great one<br>why would you stay there right<br>yeah have any of you seen a great movie<br>called<br>VI you can smile at me if you have okay<br>um it I I'm trying to remember I think I<br>saw it on TV and Z Plus for those of you<br>who are coming in from Alo New Zealand<br>um and it's a wonderful wonderful movie<br>so<br>um uh VI is uh across the Pacific in<br>many countries and this name was chosen<br>specifically so I'll explain a little<br>bit about the movie the movie is was<br>made by I think something like nine<br>Pacific women filmmakers uh filmed over<br>like seven different countries um and<br>contain seven different languages so I<br>think they come to Alo like twice and<br>then they like they're mostly like<br>speaking English and New Zealand sling<br>but um all of all of the women in the<br>movie going from a little girl up to an<br>older an older woman um represent the<br>same woman over the course of a lifetime<br>it's a it's a really great film okay and<br>um through the course of her life and<br>all of the scenes there's always like<br>rain or the ocean sometimes the the this<br>woman in these different stages of life<br>either as a Solomon Islander or a salon<br>in South you know in ockland or um<br>there's usually rain or Ocean or some<br>form of water and um in some of the the<br>scenes they're actually on the Moana so<br>none of this is by accident so just like<br>in trari why meaning water V in many<br>places places across the Pacific means<br>water and for some of us um for uh who<br>have VI in our names uh like myself um<br>VI refers to the ocean this Great Ocean<br>um what we in Hawaii call moan Nui AA or<br>the ocean of the great expanse and I<br>always think of that as the ocean of the<br>great opportunities the great<br>possibilities um and I think I'm going<br>to guess I kind of think that's what our<br>ancestors thought as they were sailing<br>into this very largest thing on planet<br>Earth it takes up onethird of the<br>surface of the Earth 995 Parts water to<br>five parts land or less by some<br>estimates and you can't see the next<br>Island and therefore you've got to be<br>very<br>smart um as you're traveling across it<br>so of course our ancestors developed<br>wave finding skills that were kind of<br>off the charts um the thing things that<br>they did um to settle the Pacific and<br>not in a wayward halfhazard accidental<br>fashion but actually in a very studied<br>very smart way um where they kept<br>supplies and took crops that were the<br>best ones to grow in any Island right<br>the most like drought resilient crops<br>with them um that all happened over a<br>few Millennia but um It's amazing And<br>what makes it more amazing is no iPads<br>no books no Seance your hand measuring<br>angles um but mathematical knowledge SC<br>biological knowledge medicinal knowledge<br>historical knowledge um only up here for<br>generations and so in Hawaii we have<br>things like the kumulipo the kumulipo is<br>a creation chant um which is<br>2,12 lines long um it takes a<br>I I have not done this I'm I have not<br>done this um but um uh by my<br>understanding it takes quite a long time<br>to recite even here in New Zealand um<br>famously some to when they were teaching<br>some chants like this would start<br>chanting at about dinner time or right<br>after dinner uh on a Saturday night and<br>they'd still be chanting early the next<br>morning right um and that genealogy<br>interestingly enough uh it's the<br>genealogy especially of the ULU Hema<br>line in Hawaii which is the an<br>especially important genealogy for<br>chiefess in Hawaii um but it links those<br>Chiefs back to 800 generations of<br>through 800 generations of time back to<br>the creation of all things um and back<br>to things like sponges and the<br>Moana right so um amazing knowledge um<br>in these places<br>um now in words like Ohana so if you've<br>watched Lilo and Stitch which I have<br>mixed feelings about but um people know<br>this about me um but if you see words<br>like Ohana um and ainga and S and Kaa um<br>in places like aloa and in kbus um that<br>word if you trace that back um through<br>Islands um there's this really important<br>connection between your kind of central<br>identity your family or your genealogy<br>um the your place the the place and the<br>land that you come from and then<br>everything else encapsulated in this one<br>word so Ohana um is OHA and AA and OHA<br>is the part of the T root uh the color<br>root that Roots into the ground and<br>links you to that place um and the other<br>part Isa for us is land and you can hear<br>that in these words AA and Kaa um<br>meaning home and um your kind of<br>extended kinship group um in places like<br>sorry I'm looking at my my S and friend<br>um uh so in in Gan Sam that's um that's<br>all of that is there in the word ainga<br>which we frequently use here in Al so<br>the important part about these languages<br>is their repositories of knowledge<br>they're virtual libraries of<br>knowledge um and the trick is<br>translation is limited right to fully<br>translate that word is<br>really almost impossible you kind of<br>have to live that word so the example<br>that I always use is that when I was<br>growing up um and this is these are the<br>beautiful things in my mother's<br>scoldings um so when we were little um<br>uh one of the things that we were taught<br>is don't be Maha oi and Maha oi is um it<br>contains all these things so I could say<br>that it's kind of like when you go visit<br>somebody else's house don't be cheeky<br>and don't ask for things that don't<br>belong to you and in fact don't ask for<br>anything don't be greedy don't ask for<br>Stuff be really humble and sit back and<br>just no no no auntie and your your job<br>is to say no thank you no thank you I<br>and not put anyone out right so that's<br>part of that but really there's so much<br>more in that word um that like when you<br>try to explain it it take you essays to<br>try to explain and then unless you've<br>lived it you may not understand it so um<br>if you're feeling like wow it's all<br>right this is how I feel when my Fugi<br>and Friends try to explain sou to to me<br>which is this holistic well-being I<br>understand it at that at at that level<br>but they keep teaching me things and I I<br>know I haven't got it yet okay so so<br>these are the limits of translation and<br>that makes the language really important<br>to preserve because it's the repository<br>it's the vehicle and everything<br>else okay so sorry our first lesson was<br>to treat mother languages as virtual<br>libraries um our second language is um<br>that transformative education will not<br>happen if we repeat the mistakes of the<br>past and the Pacific really this<br>beautiful ocean um of the great expanse<br>and<br>possibilities um has also had its fair<br>share of<br>apologies um over the last several years<br>um and other things that have gone<br>unaddressed so um uh another ol no that<br>I like um is this one which is um pretty<br>straightforward um iava mamua iava Mah<br>which um if you know your means that<br>pretty much to look forward you've got<br>to look back right um so uh we've had<br>the over the last few years we've had a<br>series of um last couple of decades we<br>had the Clark government I think in<br>2001 um make some apologies for things<br>that happened during New Zealand's<br>administration of Samo Colonial<br>administration of<br>Samoa things um that were still hurting<br>people um things that people remembered<br>because in the Pacific we don't really<br>forget a lot we<br>remember<br>um and then we have things like um uh so<br>then we have things like<br>blackbirding um does everybody know what<br>blackbirding is so yeah hopefully this<br>is some of the things that we'll be<br>learning in the new history curriculum<br>um so blackbirding was a euphemism for a<br>form of slavery whereby a 100,000<br>Pacific people from Island ranging from<br>the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu uh Fiji<br>places like that uh Samo Tonga um uh the<br>middle of the Pacific Hawaii um and as<br>far east as rapanui that's about as far<br>east as you can go um with our with our<br>Ohana um people were were stolen they<br>were tricked into thinking they were<br>going into work and were really<br>enslaved um and uh so uh I think it was<br>just<br>like last year the year before um that<br>the um a Queensland mayor apologized for<br>uh the role of Queensland in<br>blackbirding and that's because about<br>65,000 Pacific people ended up on the<br>plantations in<br>Queensland um however Pacific people<br>were also bought and sold and traded um<br>in ports like San Francisco and Honolulu<br>and Auckland and<br>akarua okay um so those those are the<br>histories that tragically link Pacific<br>people to this place um and later there<br>were some indentured servitude schemes<br>that were not much better right so those<br>are those funny things and then there's<br>places like Baba which is now um part of<br>uh the Republic of kbus and banaba was<br>once an island with a mountain um it was<br>leveled for phosphate um tragically as<br>they as this British company that New<br>Zealand was a part of mined that<br>mountain they also took the the ewe the<br>bones of the people there um so uh and<br>ground them up they became part of<br>fertilizer that was um according to<br>Katarina TAA um who's a baban and a<br>Fijian um scholar here in New Zealand um<br>was then sprinkled over farms in<br>Canterbury and<br>gisburn so um there's this weird twist<br>that the bones of those people are<br>actually in this country um but we just<br>don't think about<br>that so we of course have the impact of<br>colonization by education and I um this<br>is this has been a little bit of my<br>research which was you know in some<br>place is a really brutal thing um uh<br>brutal violent corporal punishment for<br>speaking language as we talked about um<br>and basically taking decision making<br>away from Pacific peoples and<br>reorienting that education system to um<br>to to a western construct of what<br>education should be so you can imagine<br>the impact of that on a culture that um<br>has thrived with oral history and oral<br>culture and oral repositories of<br>knowledge when you're forbidden to speak<br>your language in other places it wasn't<br>forbidden legislatively it was just<br>really hampered by benign neglect and<br>fiscal neglect as<br>well so um we know that that kind of law<br>policy and decision making and the<br>impacts it had on language continues to<br>stay with us and we see similar things<br>coming through different systems um so<br>that won't be a surprise to<br>anybody now we also see some<br>possibilities so um we also saw in uh I<br>want to say 2021 I think it was 2021 to<br>Senda ur's uh government made a formal<br>apology to Pacific people in New Zealand<br>for the dawn raids does everybody know<br>what the dawn raids are okay everyone<br>shaking their head nice I love being<br>among teachers um so uh what was<br>extraordinary of course um and you<br>hopefully can see it in that picture is<br>um that um this word EA um is literally<br>the bowing down or the<br>lowering yeah the lowering um um and<br>taking a very humble submissive and<br>apologetic physical position um allowing<br>that mat to come over you and so you can<br>see that in the picture um what was<br>extraordinary in this picture is just<br>Sinda ardern the daughter of a policeman<br>who participated in some of those raids<br>um and later a wonderful like consulate<br>um diplomatic officer to the Pacific by<br>by all accounts um is standing there um<br>just just on the other side you can see<br>Alito Minister um you know William um<br>SEO holding the side of that Matt and he<br>was one of those families that was<br>impacted by the dawn raids and at that<br>time living their family living under a<br>great deal of stress about when that<br>would happen to them so um this is<br>really an extraordinary moment for<br>Pacific people in um New Zealand history<br>although we continue to look forward to<br>a substantive um continuing stantive<br>expression of that apology um the third<br>lesson is to move uh from the language<br>of vulnerability to the language of<br>resilience and think ahead and so um we<br>have these opportunities um considering<br>that we're in the midst of all these<br>Wicked challenges like climate change<br>and climate change is in going anywhere<br>fast um it's it's something we've got to<br>navigate it's something we've got to<br>think about and it's something that we<br>have to Future proof our work about and<br>um show Learners that they've got a path<br>um to to kind of navigate as um the best<br>that they can through that um but<br>there's lessons in the kind of response<br>of Pacific peoples both anciently and<br>currently um in terms of things like<br>this so uh what you can see in the<br>picture and I I love um just has see me<br>um show this before um but um so this is<br>um probably a little poignantly this is<br>the island of Maui right and we also<br>have those headlines um you will have<br>seen of course um those tragic fires<br>lives taken um the full story is still<br>coming out um but what you but what we<br>know right is that um residential<br>communities built near the mouth of a<br>canyon known for hot Warm Winds and your<br>local indigenous Community knew that um<br>living in a place where there should<br>have been sugar cane planted and sugar<br>cane by Nature has to be well irrigated<br>takes a lot of water and instead um<br>there was IND uh non-indigenous grasses<br>planted that are highly flammable plus<br>water issues um hotels had water and<br>those local neighborhoods did not have<br>the water that they should have so while<br>all of that is still coming out um we<br>can contrast that with the way that<br>indigenous people manage that land and<br>um I am a little biased here because uh<br>my Kalama ancestors come from kipulu<br>which is that little AAA um just uh down<br>in your in the bottom bottom right hand<br>of the<br>island so um it's also where my name<br>comes from my name comes from this<br>island so um uh what you see in front of<br>you is an aopa it goes it's a ridge to<br>Reef ecosystem which is also your<br>sociopolitical unit um and within that<br>aopa the most important job of everybody<br>from uh High Chiefs down to little kids<br>who can understand is to take care of<br>the water you don't Dam the water you<br>don't cut off the water um you don't you<br>know dirty the water you make sure that<br>that water can flow right from the ridge<br>um down to the reefs when we go to the<br>uh when you go and talk to Pacific<br>people in the islands and you talk to<br>them about covid um and how it was<br>during covid or any of those things um<br>you don't hear them speaking in terms of<br>vulnerability you hear other people<br>describing them in terms of<br>vulnerability but you hear them speaking<br>in terms of resilience um and in Hawai<br>you we have um a re urgence of interest<br>in ideas like animam Mona which means<br>that everybody nobody goes hungry and<br>everybody thrives on this land um so the<br>final lesson um and I really like this<br>lesson um but the final lesson is to<br>never underestimate the power of women<br>in educational<br>transformation so I have a wonderful I<br>have several wonderful PhD students um<br>but one of my PhD students um is Teddy<br>PE Solomon um she uh she is a teacher um<br>and a department head she was the<br>Pacific Aden at tokoroa and I hope I'm<br>not embarrassing her at the moment but<br>she's awesome I'm really proud of her um<br>as is our team um she's nearly through<br>her PhD um she comes from that um strong<br>cook Island Salon etc etc Community down<br>in the south wut in a small um Town um<br>where most people are employed in things<br>like forestry um called<br>tokoroa tokoroa is is a really special<br>place I've learned more about it through<br>T um it's really a place where people<br>from the Cook Islands um formed like<br>this extension of the Cook<br>Islands um right and brothers um would<br>help brothers and their families come<br>over and you would help the next person<br>to come over and in this community The<br>Mamas are especially important so I had<br>no idea even though I studied the right<br>to education in New Zealand at some<br>point um but I had had no idea that<br>there were language nests in tooa<br>teaching tari Kiani in the<br>1960s now that's pretty amazing um where<br>um these these kinds of lovely ladies<br>the same kind of ladies that gather to<br>quilt um those particular that<br>particular quilting style is called tvi<br>um it reminds me of a Hawaiian quilting<br>style as well um but you can see them<br>carefully selecting materials you have<br>to base down the edges and then they<br>embroider the edges um it's time<br>consuming work but it's not um from what<br>I'm understanding from teddi it's not<br>that much different than what they've<br>been doing with kids for<br>Generations so you know ensuring that<br>kids get to school asking them about<br>their homework forming ensuring that<br>they know their language and their<br>culture and their Community structuring<br>the community so that at any given time<br>you have three churches right in the<br>middle right by your high school um this<br>is no mistake in this community but it<br>really um strengthens their educational<br>outcomes so she's of course studying<br>them because they experience these<br>wonderful NCA achievement rates um and<br>that's you know that's one of the<br>reasons uh why she wanted to look into<br>them um so the last the very last idea<br>um is one last ol<br>no and um uh people who know me know<br>that for a long time one of my<br>was Ma and um uh so the literal<br>translation is about the the grandchild<br>in our arms like you could say it like<br>that but there's words in here that are<br>about um like ma doesn't mean just like<br>for now it can mean like kind of always<br>in our arms like and it's like loco is<br>kind of like within like like protective<br>right um but the idea of this and um my<br>one of my daughters just had our sixth<br>grandchild a couple weeks ago or about a<br>month ago and we just love our<br>grandchildren they are the best thing<br>best things ever um best thing ever in<br>the whole world and I love my children<br>but they know this um and uh and we look<br>forward right we were looking for this<br>little guy little Elisha to come into<br>the world and anticipating that<br>preparing for that and and trying to<br>make the world a better place for him at<br>the same time so um now this really<br>isn't talking about the grandchildren I<br>hold in my arms now it's the ones we<br>look forward to it's the possibilities<br>and a grand just like that ocean of the<br>great expanse these are the<br>possibilities that we look forward to um<br>and transformative education is like<br>that we've got to think ahead to what's<br>there however um another one that I like<br>more recently um was one one that Mary<br>Caven pukui um used to start her Olo no<br>Yao book and um it's this<br>onea Alo which means the the grandchild<br>that's in our presence now and um really<br>transformative education if we wait for<br>systems to be perfect um we may be<br>waiting a a long time um but there are<br>things that we can do within our power<br>now um within our uh kind of<br>um within our um responsibilities within<br>our jobs within our families within our<br>communities um that we can do now and so<br>um a couple of these and I'll just<br>mention one thing um uh a couple of well<br>a couple of those things is use social<br>media to use Pacific language um don't<br>be afraid to try I know people that<br>don't speak some of our Pacific<br>languages um don't want to mess it up<br>and I really love that that but but we<br>love it when you try um and that we're<br>not used to that in in many public<br>educational settings we're not used to<br>people always speaking our language so<br>that is that is really awesome um if<br>you're a scholar um Dr aosa and I would<br>love to translate anything you're doing<br>on the Pacific into a Pacific language<br>and publish it in our Journal now I'm<br>looking at<br>bronwin<br>um and<br>Sashi um but please um so there's little<br>things like that we can do I don't want<br>to take any more time um I have a whole<br>list don't even get me started um but I<br>really appreciate this time to talk to<br>you all and um um I'm just really think<br>we can do this this this isn't beyond<br>the realm of possibility we can do this<br>and um sitting in a mostly Mana wah room<br>we can do this um so I I humbly offer<br>these these thoughts um and I offer my<br>Aloha Nei to you all and um just say<br>mahalo</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
