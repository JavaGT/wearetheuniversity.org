uh<br>Professor Tony Balentine and I'm the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor external<br>engagement here at the University of<br>otago and it's my absolute pleasure to<br>welcome you all here this evening to<br>this inaugural professorial lecture uh<br>in my Mi I acknowledged our location<br>where we are I acknowledge the manaa the<br>people of this place um I acknowledge<br>those who have passed before us and then<br>turn back into the<br>room acknowledge a very special person<br>Professor Lang Lots acknowledged uh all<br>of you um and then switched to English<br>and this where we are now so it is<br>fantastic to see you all here um I did<br>also acknowledge uh tobias's family uh<br>Stephanie his partner who is also clayi<br>here at the University and and their<br>daughter Freda uh so it's great to see<br>you both it is great also to have um<br>tobias's family uh joining us in in<br>Germany um and also we know lots of<br>friends and family will probably connect<br>after the event as well so warm<br>greetings to you whether you're in the<br>room whether you're online virtually now<br>or virtually in the future so um we're<br>just delighted to see you and we're<br>delighted to see you because this is a<br>celebration of one of our great<br>colleagues but it's also a very special<br>event you know it's a special event<br>because at the University of tago we<br>don't normally get dressed up<br>we certainly don't wear these robes or<br>gowns on a regular basis we only do it<br>on the most special of occasions so the<br>two times we really do it now uh when we<br>celebrate our students reaching the end<br>of their academic Journeys and<br>graduating and when we gather to<br>celebrate our colleagues attaining the<br>highest rank in the university the<br>promotion of a colleague to the rank of<br>Professor an occasion that celebrates<br>their scholarship their research and<br>their contribution to our institution to<br>their profession and to our<br>communities these occasions are really<br>special because they embody and<br>celebrate the Endeavors that are at the<br>heart of the<br>University teaching<br>supervising so engaging with our<br>students research and of course it's<br>research that under our empowering<br>legislation that defines the university<br>we are defined by delivering uh research<br>informed teaching and of course that<br>service service to colleagues um in an<br>academic unit in the division in the<br>water University but also service to<br>professions and<br>communities so this is a a very special<br>occasion it's also a special occasion<br>because it's open to our colleagues and<br>friends and members of the public and<br>that reminds us that the university<br>should always be connected uh to our<br>host community so it is great that we<br>have all gathered here to celebrate<br>knowledge and to celebrate professor<br>langlotz and his uh very significant<br>work and his promotion uh kti uh that's<br>quite enough for me I will now hand over<br>so<br>Professor<br>Ballentine professor<br>rean professor Barker Professor Brock<br>and the star of the evening Professor<br>llots then n<br>Coto<br>Stephanie and Freda a very very warm<br>welcome to you both and to your extended<br>Foo and friends both here and of course<br>online as well<br>dinoto friends and colleagues dinoto<br>dinoto<br>Oto Cura everyone cor Marie Ty tooa my<br>name is Marie and I have the distinct<br>privilege of being the pro Vice<br>Chancellor and Dean of the atago<br>business school the division of Commerce<br>and commerce is the division where<br>Professor llots was based when he was<br>awarded his promotion to Professor the<br>information science department which<br>last year was merged to become the new<br>school of computing and is now based in<br>the division of<br>Sciences it is my absolute pleasure to<br>warmly welcome you here today to<br>Professor lotz's profess professorial<br>lecture Tobias LLS was awarded and<br>promoted to Professor in February<br>2023 and tonight we come together to to<br>celebrate at this auspicious<br>achievement after completing an MSC in<br>media informatics at bohos University in<br>Germany Tobias completed a PhD in<br>Austria and Graz University of<br>Technology his PhD was entitled AR 2.0<br>social media and mobile augmented<br>reality and can I point out that<br>tobias's PhD was completed in<br>2013<br>just over 10 years ago and in this time<br>his career has gone from strength to<br>strength making full professor in less<br>than 10 years an extremely impressive<br>achievement as I said tob's PhD was on<br>social media and mobile augmented<br>reality with the concept of augmented<br>reality continuously playing a<br>significant role in his research over<br>the past 10 years<br>whether this is in the context of<br>historical photographs Sports spectating<br>and coaching ethics the physical devices<br>we use for augmented reality<br>Rehabilitation or the impact of social<br>presence and of course we will hear more<br>of that<br>tonight tobias's Research into augmented<br>reality and human augmentation a field<br>that was only explored in a few academic<br>research labs when he was embarking on<br>his academic career has of course now<br>become so relevant that quite recently<br>meta or Facebook had 1,000 job V<br>vacancies available only focused on that<br>topic Tobias talks down his role in<br>developing his field and this field and<br>his summary of His talk today but I know<br>we are going to learn of his significant<br>and internationally regarded role in De<br>veloping this field of research and<br>Innovation after graduating with his PhD<br>tobas undertook a postto at Graz<br>University of Technology as well as a as<br>well as consultancy work at the same<br>time fortunately he then saw the light<br>and applied to the University of atago<br>2013 since I sat on the interview panel<br>I can say firsthand that it was a<br>unanimous decision to offer Tobias a<br>lecturer position at a tago it was clear<br>that we needed this bright highly<br>skilled engaging academic and<br>fortunately for us he<br>accepted toas was not a lecturer for<br>long quickly becoming promoted through<br>the ranks to senior lecturer then<br>associate professor and now of course<br>full<br>Professor a promotion to full professor<br>as we've heard is not taken lightly uh<br>at the University of atago you have to<br>excel in all three areas of the role<br>teaching research and service and toas<br>has certainly achieved this and More in<br>his career as an<br>academic first research tobas has an<br>enviable I would actually describe as<br>eye watering track record and research<br>funding securing more than $14 million<br>in funding during his career to date and<br>can I just remind you this is a career<br>post PhD which has spanned just over a<br>decade he has had success in HR HRC<br>feasibility grants MB smart ideas and<br>most recently he has led a team to<br>secure an MB Endeavor research program<br>million tobias's research is highly<br>cited and awarded winning receiving<br>numerous distinctions such as best paper<br>Awards and outstanding review<br>recognitions tobas has a hugely<br>impressive research and publication<br>record which also includes patents and<br>the development of computer software a<br>true application of academic<br>research but tobas not only excels in<br>research he is also an outstanding<br>teacher teaching across all levels his<br>teaching is extremely well received by<br>students Tobias is an excellent<br>Communicator engaging with students in<br>the lecture theater and in<br>Labs he receives excellent feedback<br>teaching accolades and has been<br>instrumental in teaching into our bcom<br>core program in the first<br>year Tobias has an immensely uh<br>impressive supervision profile nine PhD<br>completions and five current pH D<br>supervisions alongside a number of<br>honors and Master's<br>students it is no surprise that he was a<br>finalist for the ousa supervisor of the<br>Year competition in<br>2016 as well as being nominated in the<br>same year for a university of atigo<br>teaching<br>award I know Tobias is well regarded and<br>sought after as a supervisor he is<br>passionate about student engagement and<br>success and he is also extremely an<br>extremely popular Mentor for our early<br>career staff always willing to give them<br>his time his wisdom um and share his<br>advice indeed tobias's service<br>commitments have been wide Reaching<br>Across the information science<br>department the division of Commerce and<br>the university particularly with respect<br>to mentoring he has also assisted<br>research development as a member of the<br>PBF steering committee a member of the<br>University of atago research Grant<br>committee and member of the committee of<br>teaching but tobas is not only an active<br>citizen across the university he also<br>contributes to The Wider Community<br>particularly through providing advice<br>and Consulting with relevant<br>organizations and co-chairing<br>international conferences in his field<br>his extensive International<br>collaboration also means he is invited<br>as a keynote to many International<br>conferences and his International<br>research collaboration is far-reaching<br>and<br>impactful although I have not been<br>fortunate enough to yet teach or<br>directly research with toes I have<br>always been taken by his energy and his<br>positivity I have also spoken to many<br>people who do get the opportunity to<br>work directly with tobas and their<br>comments and experiences are always<br>positive I thought I would share some<br>words from a colleague which I believe<br>sums up the perceived standing of<br>Professor<br>llots Tobias is easily one of the<br>brightest Minds I've encountered in my<br>academic career his remarkable ability<br>to analyze Matters from various and<br>often contradicting perspectives is<br>evident in his successes such as<br>Publications and research funding a from<br>his intellect Tobias embodies the<br>epitome of coolness amongst professors<br>and here's one of the reasons why I<br>enjoy working at a taro and I don't<br>think this would be the only person that<br>would say that to best the impact that<br>you have on students and staff is<br>evident Professor llots I am delighted<br>and absolutely privileged to be able to<br>warmly welcome you up here now to give<br>your inaugural professorial lecture<br>please join me in welcoming Professor<br>Tobias<br>llots<br>I thought I had it all under control but<br>it's not the case I quickly need<br>something to drink uh before I Collapse<br>here<br>um welcome everyone<br>Tena<br>to school of computing aoto tenot tenot<br>CA welcome everyone um I'm super nervous<br>to be here I'm really excited to have<br>you all here I'm getting emotional that<br>was planned for 45 minutes um so yeah<br>welcome everyone also welcome for those<br>online in Germany it's 5:30 at the<br>morning and I told my parents they have<br>to come um and and my my dad sometimes<br>said that they have sleeping issu so I<br>there was not even an excuse so over the<br>next couple of 45 minutes uh yeah I want<br>to tell you bit about mainly my research<br>area but but also yeah my my my small<br>role in that research area and um yeah I<br>would summarize that as a journey from<br>augmented reality this is how I started<br>to augmented human this is what it more<br>and more became um hoga said I can talk<br>as long as I want uh and you all have to<br>stay but I hopefully that will just last<br>uh 45 minutes yeah so as with every<br>Journey um yeah I have to for well you<br>have to think about where do you start<br>and I had no idea I had like five<br>different starts um but actually then I<br>realized and I came back to the classics<br>and this is you can't U yeah start to<br>talk about my fear without talking about<br>Ivan Southerland so I want to start my<br>journey really long time ago so Ivan<br>Southerland uh he was an academic and he<br>was a Pioneer in in Computing in<br>particular Pioneer in my field and the<br>60s again this was the time of of<br>Mainframe Computing uh he created this<br>um on the search of the ultimate display<br>he created this what we nowadays call a<br>head-mounted display and uh I show you a<br>video of this head-mounted display it<br>was actually a display that was mounted<br>to your head and it was attached to this<br>mechanical tracker so somehow we even<br>knew where this or he knew where this<br>device is in space and with that display<br>head mounted display he can create the<br>illusion of that green wireframe and<br>space so you can look around it you can<br>see it from different angles and he<br>didn't call it like this but for many<br>people including myself uh this was the<br>start of augmented reality yeah and so<br>again he really late in my opinion the<br>foundation he had many other<br>contribution to the field of computing<br>and as a consequence of that he was<br>awarded the touring award in<br>1988 um which is the for those of you<br>who are from a different fear this is<br>equivalent to the um Nobel Prize in<br>Computing of course that was not me I<br>was not born my parents were just about<br>teenagers my journey started much later<br>so my journey started in the 1980s in<br>the country that no longer exists so I<br>was born in in Eastern Germany uh this<br>is one of the photos that my my parents<br>sent me and uh my parents were students<br>at that time uh and architecture and<br>civil engineering so early on they<br>exposed me to German culture this is one<br>of the First videos I have of me um and<br>I don't drink alcohol uh you can put it<br>together uh if your German is a bit<br>Rusty um uh I can help you with that<br>rather a good beer than a bad University<br>lecture um so yeah um these were<br>apparently their priorities in in German<br>academic culture yeah so but besides<br>that um I had a pretty uh pretty normal<br>childhood I I did all the things and a<br>pretty good childhood so I did all the<br>things that that kids do um was maybe a<br>bit shy that some people nowadays have a<br>bit problem to understand or believe but<br>it's true um so yeah uh I learned again<br>this is still Easter Germany and again<br>but did the things that uh I guess all<br>the kids or most of the kids would do um<br>at some point I had my first contact<br>with computers um I know exactly where<br>that was I can describe the room it was<br>at my father's workplace um I think it<br>was for him also an excuse to somehow<br>get a bit more extra time at work<br>because he kind of parked me in that<br>room but I I I appreciated it uh I know<br>there were two computer games I could<br>only find this one the other one is a<br>monkey who's jumping from rope to rope<br>and I couldn't find that one um but<br>despite this it was really unforeseeable<br>that I become an academic then I become<br>an academic in Computing and that I<br>become an academic in New Zealand yeah<br>um talking about New Zealand um this was<br>my first contact with New Zealand uh my<br>granddad he was a stem collector I think<br>uh when I was around eight years he gave<br>me that book or stem collection book<br>it's a photo I just made a couple of<br>days ago so I still have it and I still<br>remember or remember this this stamp of<br>New Zealand yeah that was the first time<br>I became aware of of New Zealand it also<br>formed a bit my picture of New Zealand<br>I'm I'm very grateful after coming uh to<br>the needen that's not as icy and cold as<br>I imagined and I know many people<br>complain about the weather but yeah from<br>the stems uh from learning from stems<br>actually pretty cool place yeah<br>um if that stamp is of any value please<br>let me know of course it's an emotional<br>value but I yeah uh of course there were<br>some political changes but uh I was just<br>a teenager so for me that was uh just<br>something that was going on nevertheless<br>it also meant not just that uh somehow<br>uh the place or the country I was living<br>it got bigger but suddenly um particular<br>for my parents but later also than for<br>me it made it just more likely that uh I<br>would travel internationally or even<br>come to a place like New Zealand yeah um<br>I don't want to show too much of my<br>private photos I found quite a couple of<br>cool ones uh that's my last day at<br>school we had a special uh theme always<br>how we finished school heaven and hell<br>so I uh was Heaven and dressed up at the<br>Angel um also uh we had kind of that uh<br>that ritual at the school um and I'm not<br>sure if you would call it like this uh<br>but that we were baptized we were thrown<br>in a fountain or well in the city center<br>so this is uh uh where you see me going<br>um but that was also when the fun was<br>over because then I for the first time I<br>had to make some some big decision and<br>that was what what is the career what do<br>you want to be everyone started to ask<br>you and I had absolutely no idea um I'm<br>not sure if I should say luckily<br>uh but I gained one more year and this<br>was because back then in Germany there<br>was a compulsory military service and um<br>that I think was because they changed a<br>couple time was probably 11 months but I<br>really I wasn't Keen to go to the<br>military so uh I also have to thank you<br>my my dad my father he helped me to<br>objecting the military service so it was<br>not just something we say are not<br>interested you really had to write long<br>letter and justifying it and there were<br>two reasons and the first one is I'm<br>really not a military person to this day<br>I don't like weapons particular and<br>don't like military so much but the<br>other reason is probably a bit harder to<br>understand from nowadays perspective I<br>was not keen to cut my hair and<br>um but of course that was the reason I<br>couldn't bring up uh so again thanks<br>thanks also to my dad he helped me to<br>objective military service and but then<br>I was accepted into a replacement<br>service it's called civilian service in<br>Germany and uh I was really lucky<br>because there are a lot of options what<br>you can do and I was really lucky I was<br>in<br>um allowed to do civilian service and<br>it's Museum so it's Museum of prehistory<br>in early history in tringa in Vima which<br>is my hometown and my home Province and<br>it's not just the museum but this is<br>actually also the place they do the ex<br>excavations in the province so they<br>doing the digging and if we found<br>something and so I worked there at the<br>museums I was there over the weekend as<br>a as a guide or just paying attention I<br>built that uh under supervision of<br>course but I built that house uh there<br>which is still uh part of the museum<br>exhibition because back then they were<br>modernizing that uh but most of the time<br>I was actually either washing uh ceramic<br>that was found or I was on actually<br>excavation so I dug up an Bronx age a<br>cemetery uh to quite the shock of the<br>homeowner who wanted to build a house<br>there um I I uh found Roman coins on<br>fields and I was in a neighboring town<br>where a lot of Medieval Age so really<br>cool stuff I became really excited so<br>suddenly there was somehow the the<br>subtle idea yeah maybe that's a maybe<br>that's a pretty good career maybe I<br>should do this one and um one of my<br>supervisors or or bosses became became<br>aware of that and one day he took me a<br>bit toide and said tobas I like you oh<br>thanks um and he said but don't do it<br>don't do it and I said I said why and he<br>explained me that he as I'm not sure if<br>I remember it correctly but I'm pretty<br>sure that he had a PhD in physics and he<br>had a PhD in archaeology and he said but<br>it was very hard to find a job for him<br>and for most of the people staring this<br>is a direct route to to unemployment or<br>lots of short-term contracts and um yeah<br>so he made me think about it and um so I<br>changed my plan and or I had the feeling<br>I had to change my plan um but I really<br>didn't know what so I went back to my<br>high school uh uh graduation or not exam<br>but my marks and my best Mark was<br>computer science and I said yeah maybe<br>that's a a good plan B U maybe this is<br>what I will do so um so and this is what<br>I decided up to so enrolled in a<br>university uh small mistake I forgot<br>that most of the time uh in my school<br>when we had Computer Science Education<br>that was the pure reality uh so we<br>played this game and it was the only<br>picture I found that I can kind of show<br>um and but nevertheless I I kind of<br>ignored it and and I gave it a try um I<br>actually started at one different<br>University so um I will not talk so much<br>about that one because after one year I<br>only studied there for one year computer<br>science but after one year I changed<br>back actually to the Bowers or changed<br>to the Bowers University Vima which<br>again is in my hometown but that was not<br>the reason why it changed um the main<br>reason was because they had this new<br>degree and I roughly uh translated there<br>is no no really good English translation<br>like media informatics and what this was<br>that was a very new degree in Computing<br>it was extremely project oriented it was<br>highly interdisciplinary and it was<br>extremely research oriented yeah and and<br>I kind of liked it uh I knew someone who<br>studied it one year before me and uh<br>while I didn't like my other university<br>I always liked what he did so I said<br>yeah that's that's what I should do my<br>father was not so happy uh he said it<br>was a big mistake but I can tell it's<br>and he nowadays agree was probably one<br>of my my better moves or if not my best<br>move yeah so I enrolled there and this<br>is also when I first got in touch<br>relatively young with the feeld of<br>augmented reality uh specifically with<br>projector based or spatial augmented<br>reality so um there was a relatively new<br>professor you see him there Oliver<br>bimber um and yeah he was one of the<br>first professors in augmented Duality<br>and on the left hand side you uh you see<br>one of his uh one of his work uh that he<br>did before I joined so that was with<br>projector so there's this real uh T-rex<br>skull and with projector and some<br>Optical tricks he gave the illusion that<br>he can actually project on it and put<br>computer generated Graphics in space<br>which is augmented reality is basically<br>instead of having these classes and<br>having a wireframe you use projector<br>yeah and I joined his lab uh so you see<br>it there um and yeah that was the start<br>of my journey that was not the only lab<br>in the world doing augmented reality but<br>back then it was really constrained<br>mainly to research Labs but there were a<br>couple of other labs working on it so<br>here a few Works um so usually they use<br>projectors to somehow change the<br>appearance of as you see normally white<br>surfaces yeah and that led actually also<br>to my first research work and I was<br>still an undergrad student uh when<br>Oliver involv me and us so I was not the<br>only student and and really research<br>work so the topic was here how about we<br>don't project onto White surface but we<br>we project onto some colored surfaces<br>more specifically we wanted to project<br>on these pictorial artwork yeah so the<br>question was a bit um can we just<br>project something on it or what do we<br>need to project on this known surface if<br>we want to have a known result because<br>it turns out um you need to project<br>quite something different yeah so this<br>is this is image because you need to<br>consider somehow the background in your<br>projection yeah and we created an<br>algorithm that was doing exactly this<br>and Computing in real time so you see a<br>bit here it's relatively old video um<br>but um I'm not sure if it's me or one of<br>my friends uh who did the project with<br>me so we're holding a wide sheet of<br>paper and there you see what we actually<br>project but what you also see uh when we<br>project it on this content it kind of<br>mix and delivers or on the surface it<br>mixes with the background and gives<br>actually the result that we really want<br>to see yeah and yeah this was super<br>exciting uh I really liked it it was<br>very challenging I think for um for us<br>students but also for Oliver I have<br>never seen a professor I have to say<br>that who took that much time for their<br>students I remember uh we had weekly<br>meetings and it was not just once where<br>we had meetings that took four to five<br>hours no break and at the end we all<br>gave up and said we meet again on Monday<br>yeah um so but of course um we we then a<br>couple of applications like for example<br>you can use it for storytelling on these<br>graphical uh um yeah artworks uh using<br>highlighting effects um so just to show<br>you some of the things that we did uh<br>this is another example of the bottom<br>row this was an actual painting but it<br>turned out uh through scans they found<br>out that was overpainted a couple of<br>times and they revealed the other<br>painting and that was a story that we<br>were using these projectors able to<br>project and communicate on this actual<br>artwork yeah I became really hooked with<br>augmented reality HED with hooked with<br>research uh and hooked with uh hooked<br>with projectors so since then we<br>projected on basically everything yeah<br>um and uh so later on I was involved in<br>a project projecting Holograms uh that<br>was a one to one uh hologram of a T-rex<br>skull uh and we projected onto it which<br>is quite challenging because uh for<br>those of you who have seen actually<br>really real Holograms it's from most<br>angles it's like a transparent piece of<br>film uh I will not go into detail looks<br>relatively easy but don't imagine that<br>you just put a projector and project on<br>it yeah um later on uh we projected then<br>on also a geometrically more complex<br>surfaces like this wall uh which again<br>very corrected for the color but also<br>for the geometry and uh Stephanie said I<br>should show the wall because all of us<br>who went through that lab we spent days<br>hours and weeks to watch at that wall<br>yeah it's very much impregnated on my<br>brain yeah for all of us I think that's<br>how we spent time there so it was really<br>cool experience and again for for a<br>student uh I was involved in so much<br>research it was really excited also<br>patenting also we as a group not on me<br>alone but uh we as a group we managed<br>then to to create a um um a company with<br>that Vio uh I was working then for uh<br>one of the first employees uh uh for<br>this company they still exist but I have<br>for ages nothing to do with them but<br>they still do really cool projection uh<br>based or projection mapping software<br>yeah if you look for this for your<br>wedding or for other events yeah um so<br>it was a really cool experience I also<br>have to be thankful for Oliver because<br>actually he also allowed me to go abroad<br>which is I think an experience which is<br>really valuable so at some point he<br>asked me uh where would you like to go<br>and he offered me uh I remember it was<br>Hawaii I think it was us Colombia<br>University I didn't know it was a good<br>University back then I have to say uh<br>and I said I want to go to Japan so he<br>allowed me and he had some connections<br>so um so I went to Japan to Osaka<br>University uh where I was hosted by uh<br>professor takamura and professor kosi<br>kokawa he's still a really good friend<br>um and I went there for probably six<br>seven months I forgot and it was a<br>really really good experience um not<br>just because very different country<br>country very different culture I learned<br>some some new research on some new<br>techniques and skills so it was the<br>first time we get in contact with with<br>mobile devices so was involved in a<br>project uh that had reconstructions from<br>shrines and temples throughout Asia and<br>we rendered those on these mobile<br>devices relatively power constrainted<br>devices uh but more importantly uh there<br>was something else because I didn't go<br>alone uh so I went with my later partner<br>Stephy who's here as well and uh while<br>you all get evidence so this photo is<br>pretty much 20 years old uh Stephie<br>looks exactly the same and I think I<br>have to all of you explain who's the guy<br>on the left hand side yeah so um yeah I<br>leave this up for speculation why why<br>this is here um it's the hard work now<br>um so yeah it was a really really cool<br>experience we had a really really cool<br>time and in many ways a shape that I<br>still have a very deep connection or we<br>have a very deep connection not just<br>with each other but to Japan um and it<br>was really cool experience or really<br>good experience um I graduated from the<br>B University then with a with a master<br>of science which is pretty in common in<br>Germany that you do the full thing until<br>the master so you don't stop at the<br>bachelor which again brought the problem<br>what do you want to do next and um I<br>applied a couple of places uh and and I<br>kind of came or kind of came out that I<br>wanted to do a PhD so and there was a<br>really cool opportunity I'm really<br>thankful uh for d uh he recruited me<br>basically in his group which was back<br>then and still is one of the really best<br>and largest augmented reality groups uh<br>internationally so um so I joined as a<br>PhD student at the Kass University of<br>Technology in Austria to this day many<br>people think I'm from Austria so now<br>again uh know that I just did my PhD<br>there yeah so the group in Austria it<br>was a really big group I'm I don't have<br>the actual numbers but I think we were<br>over 20 PhD students then working on<br>augmented reality and there were overall<br>an Institute just working on computer<br>Graphics computer vision uh close to 100<br>people but a lot of people were working<br>on mobile augmented reality and so did I<br>so what is mobile augmented reality so<br>suddenly projectors were not uh not so<br>fashionable any longer but suddenly uh<br>there was that what I call uh the mobile<br>Revolution and this is uh basically that<br>something that we just used uh to place<br>a phone call and suddenly be something<br>became more powerful and I attributed to<br>that to a large extent to actually<br>Philip khah who you see on the left hand<br>side uh he was the inventor of the<br>camera phone so uh in fact and actually<br>this is the first uh it's publicly<br>available uh it's the first photo that<br>was uh made and sent via phone um from<br>his daughter and that changed a lot uh<br>some of you might remember the company<br>not called old Nokia so they were<br>dominating the mobile phone market back<br>then uh so that was their first camera<br>phone and uh it's not just when you add<br>a camera to a phone you do not just add<br>a camera to a phone what you actually do<br>is you add also add a lot of comp more<br>computational power because suddenly you<br>need this power to do the processing on<br>the photos uh to send it so actually I<br>think as a consequence phones became<br>much more powerful so what we wanted to<br>do in gr we wanted to use that power and<br>we wanted to use it to uh enable<br>actually uh an augmented reality<br>interface so again this overlay of<br>computer generated graphics and at the<br>beginning when I started my PhD I was<br>involved in a lot of project which was<br>really building the underlying<br>technology for that and back in the days<br>the typical way or the standard way how<br>you do it you needed to somehow track<br>your position and you were usually doing<br>this it's called Market tracking um so<br>you had some some fiducial some<br>outstanding object a marker think about<br>it as a barcode and uh it's somewhow on<br>the camera image but there are a couple<br>of algorithms that allow you um to<br>compute your position of the phone<br>relative to that marker and consequently<br>then the put overlay it with information<br>so this is what we did um it was<br>relatively challenging because phones<br>was by far not as uh as powerful as<br>there nowadays uh I don't want to um<br>bore you the fix point mths and the<br>implementation to to make this all quick<br>but we managed to make it quick and we<br>demonstrated different Market designs so<br>for different um use cases is here for<br>example this is one where we uh<br>augmented the map luckily um at the same<br>time also industry became much much more<br>interested in this uh so there's a<br>Qualcomm it's still one of the biggest<br>uh uh companies when it comes to mobile<br>phone related technology patents uh<br>wireless networks uh they really thought<br>uh that augmented reality is the future<br>and they started to invest so what they<br>did they kind of uh co- sponsored or<br>funded our group and they funded my<br>whole PhD and I'm really thankful that<br>it because opened really lot of avenues<br>so we patented with them we were really<br>in contact with them and they released<br>then later the SDK which among other<br>things uh uh uh integrated a lot of the<br>technology that we developed in the<br>research lab so it was really cool even<br>though I have to say that it still<br>exists but they sold it on a couple of<br>years ago to compan uh Paramount<br>technology yeah but it did more than<br>just uh Market tracking I became more<br>and more actually also um interested in<br>the question if we enable the technology<br>what is it what we can do with that so<br>one of the applications that I was<br>working is is this one so here it was<br>again a mobile phone application uh and<br>an augmented reality interface and what<br>it allowed you and this is what you see<br>there you can just go somewhere and play<br>some labels Place some annotations and<br>can share it with other people so you<br>don't not only do this for you but you<br>can place some labels for example here<br>on the campus share it with other people<br>other people can go there lift up their<br>phone and they can retrieve that<br>annotations that are presented via this<br>augmented reality<br>interface um oopsie another example and<br>still one of my favorite project by but<br>by far not my highest cited or something<br>like this but I just really like it uh<br>was the project here uh with Mato Singa<br>um we were both skaters the difference<br>was he was pretty good much better than<br>his actually C there and was really bad<br>but we also wanted to incorporate this<br>one so here the general idea is what can<br>you do with video footage with video<br>content can you also uh represented some<br>on augmented reality so here that was uh<br>our prototype so the first thing is you<br>just have to record it it's pretty much<br>you record a video um what you see on<br>the top left and but later then we<br>created an interface that someone else<br>can go there at the same location just<br>uses phone switches on the camera and<br>now receives the video and here that<br>means only the skateboarder is an<br>overlay and this is what you see here so<br>this is on a different day um you just<br>go to the same place and you retrieve<br>all for example these video<br>augmentations that are out there you can<br>do everything what you can do with a<br>video for example here back and for and<br>you can load actually several videos but<br>that for example that women is going<br>there right through<br>um there's a lot more uh stuff um uh or<br>interesting research uh that I could<br>show um but overall my PhD turned at the<br>end out that it was a lot um yeah<br>enabling uh augmented reality on mobile<br>phones um but also then thinking about<br>what to do so there was the concept of<br>what we back then called augmented<br>reality browsers so we had the idea<br>instead of just using Google or your web<br>browser you just go around with your<br>phone if you're interested in something<br>you just point your camera at it and you<br>receive that information via this Ari<br>interface um I have to say that uh uh uh<br>Stephie initially she she studied at the<br>same place uh at some point it looked<br>like uh uh she needs a bit more time<br>which was actually not the case so I was<br>then took quite some time I thought I<br>wait at the end she was much quicker uh<br>than I do but also eventually I also had<br>my PhD defense and this is this is a<br>photo there uh from my PhD defense and<br>uh actually it's two photos so that's<br>actually my public uh oral defense and<br>this other one is probably 3 minutes uh<br>after I learned that I passed the oral<br>examination um again I have to say thank<br>for for uh dmar for yeah allowing me in<br>his group and it was a really cool time<br>and a really good experience also as a<br>group um but actually also see another<br>person that many of you know and if you<br>haven't seen him he's sitting there and<br>having exactly the same tie we discussed<br>the story um uh yeah so hulga actually<br>joined uh probably halfway through my my<br>PhD and became a mentor um but actually<br>also an external examiner so which is<br>okay in the Austrian right so and this<br>is uh where we got in touch and that<br>again changed quite my direction because<br>he knew again I had to think about what<br>to do next and I discussed a couple of<br>plans with him and at some point he he<br>asked um can you imagine coming to New<br>Zealand and I know exactly when he asked<br>the question I was like I have not even<br>thought about it but at the end I<br>thought about it or we thought about it<br>and we applied worldwide almost<br>everywhere and<br>um you were on the job interview yeah so<br>apparently I did not completely screw up<br>um I I got the offer from from danen and<br>decided to go uh so it's a big move uh<br>moving on the other side of the world uh<br>I know some others of you have done it<br>as well I vividly remember when the big<br>container came and picked up all our<br>belongings I even more remember uh that<br>our ship had the biggest container loss<br>reported in history<br>um<br>um yeah do do an insurance um yeah no I<br>have to say it all R safely yeah but but<br>I was nervous for for at least a month<br>yeah uh and I had a good start here then<br>at Taro in 2014 as already highlight<br>before so here I again I um I I want to<br>continue working on augmented reality<br>but I also uh continue to working on<br>mobile devices so one of the first<br>research themes uh that I was working on<br>and still work on is is this idea of<br>mobile tele presence and virtual tourism<br>so what's what's the idea so the idea is<br>I was far away from home suddenly and<br>there was always I actually before<br>coming here I already developed the idea<br>it would be really cool if we can use<br>these mobile devices and not just do<br>Skype FaceTime Zoom calls but but really<br>share the environment yeah instead of<br>let's let's imagine I call my parents I<br>don't want to just show uh them because<br>for them is they they can only look<br>where I point my my camera which makes<br>them clear that they're not there I want<br>to give them the feeling that they can<br>really freely look around regardless of<br>where I'm looking at so and this is not<br>possible I was not the only one with<br>that identify that problem so there's a<br>work I quite like a lot from swen CRZ uh<br>he called it poly which was basically<br>the shoulder uh um mounted robot which<br>allowed remote people to turn the phone<br>but we wanted to do it without these<br>robots so we came up with an approach so<br>this is relatively early on and I just<br>show you the final result so so imagine<br>that I'm actually of the University ofo<br>campus um and here it looks like we're<br>just making a panorama but it's what we<br>called it's actually life Panorama so<br>while we're actually rotating our phone<br>around we share everything what we<br>capture like this panorama which is<br>conly updated also with another site so<br>and then on the other side there is<br>let's say y who was working with me on<br>that project and he receives that<br>information but because over time this<br>Panorama builds and also constantly<br>updated allows him to freely look around<br>yeah at his own pace um so we were<br>indicating of course where everyone was<br>looking at and you uh could also do uh<br>small things like for example drawing<br>into the Panorama as you will see in a<br>second and highlight something what you<br>don't see is that they're constantly<br>connected also via audio and Chris who's<br>then actually the person was back then<br>the person who was there in front of the<br>clock tower here he would then see<br>basically this marking via an augmented<br>reality interface that started really<br>that project started a big theme and um<br>actually I would like to talk about that<br>almost like or could talk about it for<br>minutes um because then someone else<br>took over Jacob who's also here and he<br>made it his PhD topic and and had really<br>great results uh and I already told him<br>that I will compress it uh and only give<br>uh some of the examples what he did so<br>this was one of his later works and uh<br>this is a prototype again of a mobile<br>device it's all mobile devices and this<br>time instead of having a panoramic<br>environment it was almost like a mobile<br>3D scanner so this is what you see here<br>so while he's starting his application<br>and just going along it starts to build<br>a 3D model not just for him but the 3D<br>model again is constantly sent to the<br>other side as well so here just a bit<br>accelerated at some point he<br>reconstructed again while being<br>connected to another person uh his his<br>apartment back then uh so basically uh<br>while Jacob is going around and<br>reconstructing his Department the other<br>side also sees more and more and more of<br>jop's apartment yeah we did a lot of<br>studies on that one uh how people feel<br>it how they perceive it and you can<br>build uh like really funny applications<br>so this is Jacob again in his apartment<br>and he invited here Rosa another student<br>who's represented by an avatar and she<br>can go around and um uh move in and<br>Jacob's apartment yeah so that's the the<br>whole idea of really just using mobile<br>technology bringing people together in a<br>more immersive way than we currently do<br>it with zoom or other Technologies uh uh<br>I bring this up because at some point<br>then I said oh Jacob is finished done<br>excellent work let's stop here but then<br>uh hulga and I we were discussing it say<br>yeah we had a couple of ideas and one of<br>the ideas and that became really um like<br>a big new project um is the idea to use<br>a similar develop a similar technology<br>and of course go much further and use it<br>for tourism experience which was<br>basically almost like we started because<br>initially I wanted to have my grandma<br>and bring her to New Zealand yeah so<br>here you see uh a lily who's also here<br>uh this is couple of weeks ago with some<br>our partners on the west coast so the<br>idea is that there's a local guide for<br>example really uh kayaking in that<br>scenario and then real time sharing<br>everything the whole environment with<br>someone else for example Jacob who could<br>again then uh uh or is connected and and<br>immersed in this environment and really<br>ideally feels like being there okay um<br>so I'm and I really want to thankful for<br>for M actually of supporting that as you<br>have heard beforehand it was uh uh quite<br>an unexpected and and uh yeah big<br>achievement yeah from the whole<br>team finally another theme that I uh<br>established was the idea of vision<br>augmentations and augmented human and<br>that was another theme that I'm uh did<br>uh and still doing with we're still<br>working on that uh which somehow emerged<br>and became quite big bit similar to this<br>um to the work on mobile devices is<br>actually driven by the changes in<br>technology so I would call it the the<br>rise of head mounted augmented reality<br>in virtual reality<br>displays I started with Ivan<br>southernland in the 60s with the first<br>head mounted displays but also for years<br>for decades not much happened uh there<br>were very few uh Labs who could afford<br>or build head mounted displays and many<br>people did not research on it there were<br>few uh products that were developed um<br>for uh for military purposes mainly uh<br>but they came at the price and there<br>were very few there was almost nothing<br>uh for the uh end user market and that<br>changed and that changed uh mainly I<br>think or I would argue through two<br>devices so it's the Google class and the<br>Oculus Rift um some of you have heard it<br>one that's more an AR device and the<br>other more an VR head mounted display<br>where the success<br>well not in the commercial sense uh they<br>were not successful but I think they<br>really started something because what<br>they showed is actually then suddenly<br>you can build these devices and make<br>them relatively affordable yeah and it<br>really triggered in particular Oculus<br>really triggered a large investment into<br>this augmented in virtual reality<br>technology so since then and you<br>probably have heard it in the news uh if<br>you follow that from time to time almost<br>uh everyone is now somehow committed uh<br>uh financially also committed um to the<br>field of augmented virtuality uh may it<br>be Microsoft or snap uh meta obviously<br>magic Le which is heavily backed up by<br>Google or the recent release of the<br>Apple Vision Pro so many companies<br>consider this somehow the future of<br>computing so what do we do do we again<br>show some annotations yes you can yeah<br>you can also show your browser or some<br>image material I can watch a video but<br>we became more interested to use that<br>technology and do something completely<br>different with it and um specifically<br>this was we got kind of interested in<br>replacing something uh that we all have<br>for centuries and this is traditional<br>classes yeah we thought can we use the<br>technology and can build computerized<br>classes and this is what we call Vision<br>augmentations or it's one part or one<br>sub feet of this large area of human<br>augmentations yeah so uh and we started<br>to work on that on the right hand side<br>uh you see Jonathan<br>um and you will see him in a couple of<br>photos because he was a PhD student and<br>he started to work with me um uh for his<br>PhD and Jonathan uh was coincidentally<br>um he was affected by color vision<br>deficiency or many of you know it under<br>color blindness and that was also just<br>really coincidentally one of the first<br>um applications or scenarios that we had<br>in mind for a couple of reasons because<br>it's relatively well understood It's<br>relatively it's not absolutely uncommon<br>um but there is also um um how should I<br>say for most of the people there is a<br>lower severity so for ethical reasons uh<br>that was quite a good scenario so what<br>is color vision deficiency again color<br>blindness it's also often called uh<br>usually it's affect men and we just<br>perceive the environment quite<br>differently there is a simulation uh of<br>different forms of color blindness or<br>color vision deficiency and um I hope<br>you see that the world looks quite<br>different and people can be even though<br>it's considered a relatively mild uh uh<br>uh impairment people can be affected<br>Jonathan for example uh he wanted to go<br>to the military exactly the opposite by<br>the way to what I wanted to do um but<br>luckily uh uh oh well unlucky for him he<br>couldn't because he was color blind<br>lucky for me because he ended up as a<br>PhD student an excellent PhD<br>student um so what was the general idea<br>and there a couple of detailed pictures<br>but on a very high level the idea is we<br>want to build some classes really build<br>some classes and the idea is that they<br>integrate some camera and we want that<br>the camera is almost seeing what the<br>what the eye is seeing perceiving the<br>environment this the eye and then we<br>wanted to do some yeah so seeing for<br>example here this ishihara marker which<br>is a really old uh method for detecting<br>color vision deficiency and the general<br>idea was that if we have an image of the<br>environment uh we want to sense some of<br>the colors some of what we call the<br>critical colors so the colors that<br>people who are affected by cision<br>deficiency struggle with and then via<br>that small display that is integrated<br>here we wanted to change the color so we<br>wanted to compute an overlay that we<br>show here and display to the wearer yeah<br>and again similar to the work with the<br>projectors at the beginning uh that<br>overlay will mix with the real world<br>yeah because you see both a half<br>transparent display and slightly change<br>the colors uh I always it's very much<br>always exaggerated uh I will later talk<br>about it for a second yeah to achieve<br>the the effect Jonathan built a lot of<br>prototypes and tested a lot of<br>prototypes uh this by far not everything<br>uh the 3D printer in our lab not just<br>because of him but also because of him<br>is very well used he built small<br>prototypes benchtop opticle prototypes<br>mobile prototypes lots of prototypes um<br>and uh we tested them so this is this is<br>Jonathan uh one of the uh larger<br>prototypes that we built early on here<br>this is to give you a rough idea how<br>that looks like it's not calibrated for<br>the camera but I think for either<br>Jonathan or my eye so this is why it's<br>slightly off yeah but you see that we<br>lightly manipulate the colors in fact if<br>it's really calibrated for your eye or<br>for the camera that is the perception<br>that you that you get again with a very<br>strong and exaggerated effect here for<br>maximum<br>visibility um we tested of course not<br>just in uh uh on these isara markers but<br>also uh uh we we had a lot of<br>participants in there uh who were all<br>diagnosed at cavision deficient um and<br>we tested in different conditions uh I<br>know that someone else came up with<br>example said I'm always really affected<br>by the games because there's the health<br>bars and they're green and then switch<br>to the red and I I really struggle to<br>see it yeah so this is what you see then<br>on the left hand side uh of course for<br>illustration uh for other Graphics<br>mixing colors and again the isara marker<br>and here this isara Mark on the right<br>hand side this is just an example<br>because it actually shows how little you<br>actually only need to change the colors<br>this is all captured through these<br>classes but uh on the right hand side<br>this is calibrated for Jonathan um and<br>then the top one he sees a<br>21 uh he looked so often at the markers<br>I think he he also now sees a 74 but but<br>he sees a 20 21 that case and for him he<br>only needed a very subtle change that<br>you hopefully can see to make it clearly<br>a 74 this depends of course in the<br>severity uh it's just an illustration<br>that for most of the people this effect<br>does not by far not be uh that strong as<br>it's shown in the other pictures<br>yeah and that really started something<br>uh it started a big theme for me it<br>started a big PhD for Jonathan um<br>because then we got it really exciting<br>said if we can do this what else can we<br>do so it really started the idea that we<br>really have these computer controlled<br>classes so so suddenly we were directing<br>attention uh so we had then for example<br>imagine that you're in an environment<br>and normally people would just look at<br>the areas that are here indicated as<br>bright but somehow let's imagine I want<br>to they are normally not looking there<br>what can I do to actually if I want them<br>to look there so<br>which basically is that area yeah so we<br>develop basically an algorithm that or<br>classes that allowed you to do that so<br>what they do you put on the classes and<br>in a very subtle way they change the<br>appearance of the real world they tone<br>it a bit down make it a bit more unsharp<br>reduce the contrast and reduce the<br>intensity something that we call Visual<br>saliency and they modulate it and make<br>certain other areas suddenly very<br>appealing and attractive to the human<br>eye yeah so we implemented then again as<br>a high level overview uh again in these<br>classes the overlay what you actually<br>show in this classes looks like this but<br>again similar with the projectors it<br>mixes with the real world uh to achieve<br>that effect and we did a lot of ey<br>tracking studies uh with participants<br>where we showed them for example how<br>effective it is and that they really<br>showed they much quicker at the areas<br>where they normally would not look much<br>quicker much longer by still while still<br>exploring the rest of the image and this<br>has lots of potential applications uh<br>even though this was not the focus um I<br>need a couple of more minutes but again<br>I have as much time as I want um yeah if<br>you no um so we did other works uh where<br>we then for example we're also looking<br>in computational Optics so not<br>necessarily using this half transparent<br>display but for example we built in<br>classes and prototype uh together with<br>our partners in Japan utos group for<br>example they were replacing the static<br>lens with programming Optics yeah with<br>computer controlled lenses and there<br>different ways to do it but we had here<br>one of these computer controlled Optics<br>that you see here that is basically<br>basically going from front Focus to back<br>focus and um not only can you do this<br>you can control it at runtime but you<br>actually you can actually also Focus<br>elements that are far away and very<br>close and put both of them in Focus<br>which is kind of interesting um<br>particular for people who normally would<br>need bifocal classes yeah um more<br>recently uh we again expanded more and<br>more and I just want to briefly mention<br>so this is one of our more recent work<br>uh this is the idea with Jun who also<br>should be here is hiding um so his PhD<br>is again on uh on these computational<br>classes but he explores more the idea of<br>visual discomfort or something what we<br>call Visual noise so uh and can we<br>basically his question is what is<br>actually this visual noise or what<br>causes visual discomfort and healthy uh<br>uh people and uh can we actually<br>compensate for that with these classes<br>so one of the example are if you're<br>epileptic you should be careful uh could<br>be for example this I know some people<br>are extremely sensitive to that flick<br>why some others are like no I don't care<br>so the question and he demonstrated that<br>that we can compensate for that another<br>example is for example this glare and<br>the night we can't wear Sun classes<br>because it's night but something is<br>still relatively bright can we build<br>classes that detect that and make those<br>areas very selectively dark yeah so um<br>this is jiz so if you see him with<br>classes prototypes around don't be<br>surprised um uh he is a very nice human<br>being and he was just told to do that<br>yeah no no uh really cool work so to<br>wrap this a bit up um and to bring you<br>one step closer uh uh to the snakes um<br>so that Journey again did not start for<br>me but the Journey of augmented reality<br>for me always started and and the 96 at<br>the time of Mainframe Computing yeah<br>again absolutely revolutionary work that<br>at that time when most of the computer<br>didn't had an traditional display<br>someone was thinking about this display<br>for me it started much later and what we<br>often call the personal computing time<br>so basically we had more personal<br>computers and that was when I started<br>this work as a pro on projectors still<br>projector-based augmented reality is<br>something that you were not experiencing<br>continuously you went to an exhibition<br>uh and this is where you were exposed to<br>that so it's really something that you<br>rarely use and for specific events that<br>already changed a bit with with mobile<br>phones um and not just because mobile<br>phones became such more pervasive or<br>ubitus to us yeah we we have a lot of<br>power in our pockets um but they Al<br>suddenly allowed a relatively easy way<br>and cheap way relatively cheap way to<br>implement an augmented reality interface<br>but already B back then said an<br>augmented reality interface on the phone<br>it's yeah you use it and you look around<br>you switch it on and then you switch it<br>off it's not continuously used but this<br>is what's going to change so in one of<br>our works we said or we we proclaimed uh<br>that that the trend what we're going is<br>what we call um pervasive augmented<br>reality so this is in continuous<br>augmented reality experience and I gave<br>you a couple of examples uh where it can<br>be used as an assisted technology uh<br>maybe with create benefits but of course<br>there are also a lot of other scenarios<br>where you ask yourself do you want to be<br>constantly augmented can can I still<br>separate what is real and what is<br>virtual and particular with hulga or L<br>by hulga uh we're also looking at the at<br>the ethical dimensions of uh dimensions<br>of that because the overall question is<br>that uh is that what we want so this is<br>a simulations relatively known well<br>known from ich matsuda there are much<br>more videos he created this videos where<br>you basically have the ultimate<br>continuous augmented reality everything<br>is augmented you it's very hard to<br>distinguish what is weird what is not do<br>we want that um I as someone who who<br>builds technology for that I say<br>probably not but at the same time I<br>believe very much in in the potential<br>and the the really cool application and<br>cool really useful application what we<br>can do with that yeah so this is<br>something more food for for for you and<br>I will question you next time<br>with that I want to finish but as you<br>know uh an IPL is actually always a very<br>good time or not not just a very good<br>time but makes it much or very clear how<br>much you rely on different people and I<br>could talk now for the next two hours um<br>I will not do that and I just want to<br>highlight a few of those foremost the<br>students and I apologize to the two<br>students where I don't have a picture um<br>so thanks a lot um you did all the hard<br>work that I'm just casually talking<br>about uh it's because of you it's really<br>joy to to go to the lab every day uh<br>thanks for the cool lab culture and and<br>really um for the really yeah for the<br>really cool time it's really of course<br>we have all good and bad times but<br>somehow because of you um yeah I really<br>like my job yeah so thank you to all of<br>you including also my first students at<br>Gratz University of Technology because I<br>started to supervise students there as<br>well and I had a really good start there<br>a couple of people that are working in<br>the background and we rarely talk about<br>um but I want to talk talk about some of<br>those and this is Heather and Gail I'm<br>not sure if Heather is here no she um so<br>who were basically our administrator in<br>our department for a long time and since<br>then retired I would have been screwed<br>without them from day one yeah I was<br>like a baby so uh they helped me<br>continuously so a big thank you for that<br>I always remember had I came with a<br>problems he said always leave it with me<br>and I left it with her and she really<br>found a solution and thanks for that um<br>couple of other people that always<br>worked in the background um I had in in<br>the division of Commerce where I was<br>until recently two really awesome<br>research adviser and I was really lucky<br>as uh uh Professor th highlighted<br>beforehand to to have that success but<br>to a large extent I attributed to them<br>uh they just did me told me exactly what<br>I should do and I was just yeah I do it<br>so thanks Gabrielle and thanks jelica uh<br>yeah like uh it's to large part also<br>because of you uh Graham Arnold some of<br>you know it he was until recently my<br>divisional financial advisor uh I'm not<br>sure if you after the talk think I'm<br>smart or not smart I can just tell you<br>one thing I can't read my financial<br>statement and I'm absolutely stupid when<br>it comes to that without him I would be<br>screwed I spend there so much time uh so<br>uh thanks gram for that um I'm still not<br>surviving yeah uh couple of more people<br>I have lots of external collaborators<br>but like three people I did a lot of<br>work with uh Dennis car kofen from GR<br>uto uh from Tokyo University or<br>University of Tokyo and Jen kruba from<br>KOB University of applied science became<br>really good friends are really good<br>friends and enjy to collaborate with<br>them almost finally I had almost so not<br>almost I had always amazing HS yeah and<br>uh it's really great that started from<br>mik wiov who hired me then later to<br>hulga and noways Grant as our head of<br>school um I was very lucky uh I had<br>really the best HS that you can imagine<br>always fighting for the department and<br>as a consequence also always supporting<br>me and I can tell you and I know there<br>are quite a lot of academics here it<br>really helps that you know when when<br>when your H is supporting you so thank<br>you for that one particular thank for<br>hogga I will not make it too awkward but<br>as you know many of you know uh hoga was<br>not just an HUD you have seen it in the<br>photos uh he has been a mentor he's been<br>colleague we ran the lab together we<br>supervis together um it's probably very<br>fair to say without hogga I wouldn't be<br>here uh uh and also uh not here in Oto<br>but probably also not here today yeah so<br>thank you for that uh finally and this<br>is then really last one thanks to my<br>parents uh I hope it's not too early uh<br>thank you for getting up uh mom you're<br>almost done and then you can do a Power<br>naap uh yeah thanks for thanks for<br>always supporting me uh and um yeah<br>believing in me and finally uh I want to<br>thank to those two uh they are there to<br>Freda and my partner Stephie uh because<br>they always show me where my place is at<br>the bench next to them and uh thanks for<br>going through the journey together uh as<br>some of you might know uh you call it<br>the two body problem and yeah there's no<br>one I I would like more to have and go<br>through the two body problem and an<br>academic career uh I think you're much<br>smarter I think you should stay here but<br>I'm not sure if it's too inappropriate I<br>say hopefully that will come soon yeah<br>so thanks for that um with that I would<br>I would finish again thanks everyone for<br>coming for listening to for a bit more<br>maybe what hell of a good talk I mean I<br>I was really entertained it really shows<br>what great<br>teacher tobas is you can imagine in<br>class you know really engaging with the<br>audience and yeah what a great talk and<br>I would like also to Echo uh what<br>Professor Ty said what a career what a<br>career what a career so um I want to<br>highlight a couple of things that to<br>beia's work is really as you could see<br>in his in his talk is really relevant<br>right so he does relevant stuff is<br>shaping the next generation of<br>Technology with his F you know<br>fundamental and applied applied work<br>right and you saw it as examples let's<br>say with the color deficiency studies or<br>with directing attention with augment<br>reality glasses uh so that has an impact<br>and when you think of it in the<br>foreseeable future that will have an<br>impact on all kinds of spheres of our<br>life private and and and businesslike<br>right so there's a lot of that it's also<br>very timely so it's Timely search not<br>only because you have seen those head<br>mounted displays or reality glasses up<br>there but combined probably with artif<br>artificial intelligence these days these<br>are the Hot Topics right that's mainly<br>AR and and AI which might shape the<br>future and he's at the Forefront of it<br>right so that's what I wanted to say<br>what I also wanted to say probably not<br>many of you might know and I do a little<br>bit of promotion here so that um so the<br>the all academics in this country go<br>through a research assessment exercise<br>you know every six or so years right so<br>each of us will be U evaluated on on all<br>kinds of research matters and then we<br>get assigned you know a grade right and<br>of course uh to be as you know received<br>the highest of those grades in a right<br>but also what I wanted to say is that<br>Computing here at otago was ranked in<br>the last uh research assessment exercise<br>as number one in the country so uh in<br>addition to that uh I would say and to<br>beas might might dis agree but when you<br>now come to tobas and say okay let's<br>let's have a look at the high quality<br>Publications the number and the quality<br>of Publications and the research funding<br>I would uh I would rate them as the best<br>as the best researcher in the in the<br>school so now you connect the dots right<br>so we have the best best Computing in in<br>the country and we have the best<br>researcher uh in in in the school so I I<br>think we have I'm really I'm really<br>honored to have tobas as a as as as a<br>colleague and thanks for mentioning all<br>that thank you very much for that right<br>here yes<br>um uh as a little token of appreciation<br>I was asked to actually hand over this<br>it is not a frame picture of the head of<br>Department it's<br>not but uh thank you very much it was a<br>very good good talk thank you very much<br>and I think we all can join join me and<br>lot thank you for all for coming uh also<br>the ones on uh on the video link the<br>parents and perhaps Jonathan as well I<br>don't know who is who's joining uh<br>thanks for getting up that early uh<br>thanks for doing the recording media<br>team thanks up there and um actually um<br>the only thing I can say now is uh we<br>invite you to come over to the staff<br>club for some for a cup of tea and and<br>some some refreshments and I thank tobas<br>again for his for his great talk and um<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
