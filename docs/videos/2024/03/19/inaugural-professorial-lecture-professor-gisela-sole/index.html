name is Helen<br>Nicholson and I'm the acting Vice<br>Chancellor at the University of atago<br>and it's my great pleasure to welcome<br>you to this inaugural professorial<br>lecture to Mark the promotion of gizela<br>soul to professor and this is the first<br>professorial lecture this year um in<br>denen anyway so welcome to it I'd like<br>to give a warm welcome to giza's family<br>and friends who are with us in person<br>and online and I'd like to give a<br>special welcome to giza's husband Chris<br>and um daughter Claudia and Son<br>Sebastian who are with us and her<br>brother Mel sisters Monica and Heidi and<br>their families who are joining from<br>South Africa<br>so as I've said before promotion to<br>professor at the University of ataro is<br>not easily achieved and it requires an<br>academic to show outstanding competence<br>and leadership in teaching research and<br>service and as you'll hear shortly um<br>Giza has demonstrated all of these um<br>it's particularly special for me to um<br>introduce gea's IPL this evening um<br>geiza I had this pleasure of being one<br>of giza's PhD student uh supervisors and<br>a student I learned a lot from her and<br>um we've stayed friends ever since um in<br>fact we have shared interests we both<br>sing in the city choir of denen but<br>other sides of the um Hall and and we<br>both go to St John's Church so it's it's<br>good to be there it's also very special<br>for me because um gizer is the first of<br>my PhD students from atago to become a<br>professor so it's lovely that I can be<br>here um congratulations gesler on your<br>welld deserved promotion I'm very much<br>looking forward to your lecture and I'm<br>now going to hand over to Professor Lee<br>hail who's going to give a formal<br>Saul<br>T<br>not<br>manak ha<br>took good evening my name is Lee hail<br>and I'm the dean of the school of<br>Physiotherapy and a very warm welcome to<br>you all on this very significant<br>celebration Professor Giza Soul's<br>inaugural professorial lecture it's a<br>mouthful that and a very special welcome<br>to Giza family<br>Chris um Claudia and Sebastian and to a<br>family linking in from South Africa Hora<br>good morning to you all and welcome<br>notably giza's promotion to Prof<br>professorship is only the second one<br>that has occurred in our school for the<br>internal promotion process so very well<br>done on this outstanding<br>achievement Giza joined the school in<br>2001 she came to us from South Africa<br>having completed her Bachelor of um BC<br>physiotherapy at the University of<br>stellos and her BC honors and MSC in<br>exercise science at University of Cape<br>Town she had a varied work history in<br>South Africa working in one Military<br>Hospital in Petoria and then an acute<br>and a sports injury um clinic in<br>Switzerland and then back to Private<br>Practice in Cape Town and then as a<br>senior lecturer at the University of<br>Cape Town's Department of<br>physiotherapy G Giza went on to attain<br>her PhD from aara in 2008 with work<br>focusing on hamstring<br>injuries for those in the audience who<br>are Runners if I'm not mistaken one of<br>gea's PhD advisers of the<br>internationally renowned Professor Tim<br>Stokes author of law of running is that<br>correct<br>here at a taro um Giza has gone on to<br>develop expertise in teaching and<br>research in the areas of sports<br>Physiotherapy and mascular skle and<br>manual manipulative therapy in<br>particular research has focused on ACL<br>injuries shoulder pan and in<br>implementing a sport framework for<br>students with concussion in secondary<br>schools she has successfully obtained<br>both intern internal and external grant<br>funding to support this research and<br>recently was awarded a three-year HRC<br>project Grant to investigate stepped<br>Rehabilitation for people with<br>persistent pain and she's also stany<br>Paris research fellow in her research<br>Giza collaborates with International<br>researchers from this from Sweden the<br>States Canada J and<br>Japan she has supervised or<br>co-supervised 11 PhD and four Masters<br>students to completion as well as a<br>number of b50 honor student<br>projects she has a really robust<br>publishing record having published over<br>86 peer reviewed journals many and high<br>impact journals such as sports medicine<br>and the British Journal of sports<br>medicine her presentation tonight will<br>showcase a diverse range of method<br>theologies she uses within this<br>research key areas of teaching for Giza<br>are the postgraduate paper and sports<br>physiotherapy the school's b50 honors<br>research paper and also ensuring that<br>our undergraduate students are trained<br>in sports meding and um team up with<br>local sports teams here and and<br>nationally you can ask her what sports<br>meding is if you don't understand<br>that giza's undertaken a range of<br>service roles in our school including<br>associ dean of undergrad studies<br>chairperson of the school's Ethics<br>Committee and is currently the school's<br>Deputy Dean her wider Services extend to<br>the being on the University of um<br>University's Board of studies Senate and<br>has been president of theago medical<br>school research Society she's been on<br>numerous um physiotherapy New Zealand<br>committees including twice being the<br>scientific chair of our pnz national<br>conference and she's the New Zealand<br>representative of on the Australian<br>physiotherapy Council accreditation<br>committee and I think I'll leave it at<br>that and highlighting giza's CV as<br>you've come to hear her talk not me so<br>in short Giza is well deserving of her<br>professorial ship and very well done<br>from the school of<br>physiotherapy now I'd like to invite<br>Giza to present her IPL entitled<br>movement for health head shoulder knees<br>and I did ask her where are and toes cuz<br>I know she does research on the foot but<br>Giza<br>rust Han Burma<br>Hana<br>F<br>Chris<br>cludia<br>Lee and Helen thank you for the<br>invitation or for the kind<br>introduction um friends of course the<br>family also online neighbors um longtime<br>friends choir church friends and I think<br>there's some Runners here as well<br>somewhere over there um thank you for<br>joining us tonight it is an absolute<br>honor to share not only about my<br>research but a little bit about myself<br>and how I got to where I'm now so the<br>story of my family starts in<br>Germany when my ancestors um immigrated<br>to South Africa in the late<br>1800s and they settled in the eastern<br>part of the country my father gter was<br>born in a on a farm um just outside a<br>tiny little village called VB or W in<br>English it was called Sandy Mount during<br>the World War II and then got back to V<br>again afterwards and he wanted to become<br>an architect but he had to get leave<br>school as a teenager and start an<br>apprenticeship to become a builder and a<br>carpenter and we have some of his<br>furniture with us in our<br>house my mother was born in the OR grew<br>up in the northern part of um Nel but it<br>was called then and um a little German<br>Lutheran Community called Olsen she came<br>down to V for her high school at the<br>V where we went a well um and that's<br>where she met her future husband in the<br>youth group she had to return home after<br>school because her father did not think<br>women should have a career much has<br>changed and he was that was normal at<br>that stage for many fathers they were<br>married by the time that my mom was 21<br>and she they had four children have four<br>children um Mel and the two younger um<br>sisters for me Monica and Heidi this<br>photo was taken<br>2014 the last Christmas where we were<br>all together with my parents and I do<br>want to acknowledge my sister-in-law Gan<br>who passed away in December um quite<br>unexpectedly<br>um my father being a builder he built<br>our little house on the farm next to the<br>house of my grandparents this tiny<br>little cottage thatched Ro and as<br>Boulders do they extend the house and<br>they extend and extend my mom one say<br>she's never lived in a fully completed<br>house but it turned out to be quite a<br>large house and my mom did the gardening<br>um with help but she she absolutely had<br>green fingers we went to the vate H of s<br>this photo was taken of probably a third<br>of my class in<br>2019 reunion just before Co hit us first<br>four years at school were in German and<br>we started learning English when I was<br>about 9 or 10 and Africans as well and<br>then two years later the German and the<br>English speakers were merged into one<br>class and it was all English and we all<br>had to do German as a foreign language<br>and of course metrick we all got A's um<br>and then as Lee already said I went to<br>the um university of stalos some people<br>thought that I was going to study<br>mathematics and music and were very<br>surprised when I came back and said I'm<br>actually doing<br>physiotherapy um I was the Dux of the<br>class and also did grade eight piano um<br>exam in my last year my love for music<br>comes from our parents my mother was a<br>Pianist and organ player um and I<br>remember falling asleep as a child with<br>her practicing the piano for her next<br>exam so so she did become a piano<br>teacher my father did not learn an<br>instrument really well he played the<br>trumpet as many lutherans do um and then<br>but was very involved in the choir a Bak<br>choir which is quite common in the<br>German Lutheran Community and he was a<br>chair person so that's where my love for<br>choir singing comes as<br>well so coming back here I did work in<br>Durban first and then in the military<br>hospital and pretorius I always get<br>itchy feet and always move quite a lot<br>in those times and it came a time where<br>thought what else can I do should I<br>become a doctor I did apply for medicine<br>but checken out and went to Switzerland<br>instead I got a position in Canon Aro<br>which Aro is halfway between um Basel<br>and Zurich and um stayed there for about<br>18 months and this is the team the<br>nursing team of the neurosurgery Ward so<br>neurosurgery muscular scle so I've done<br>all the rotations um in terms of<br>Physiotherapy<br>I then met a physio who by chance was<br>opening a clinic in Zurich in the middle<br>of a fitness center a gym and that was<br>very unusual for physios at that time in<br>the 1980s to work in gyms so there was<br>an incredibly great experience for me in<br>terms of exercise prescription at that<br>time I also started to do more courses<br>in medipol of physiotherapy particular<br>in the Jeff mland concept which<br>originated in Australia and what struck<br>me with him so he was influence<br>influential for me as a clinician what<br>struck me was his absolute humility and<br>the way that he communicated with the<br>patient person Center Care was<br>absolutely maintenant back in the 1980s<br>already and earlier and here on his own<br>course he was filming a young instructor<br>called Harry from Pats from the<br>Netherlands demonstrating new techniques<br>on matlin's own wife so he was willing<br>to learn from young people on his course<br>um and that really impressed me I was in<br>Switzerland for four years made<br>fantastic friends and was in the<br>mountains this was a snow a snow showing<br>Expedition with my physio friends I<br>could go to different cities just for<br>weekend F now come back go to work next<br>week in Z Bo that kind of Lifestyle but<br>then after four years one year became<br>four years I had to make a decision what<br>I wanted to do stay there or go back to<br>South Africa to people really stand out<br>in<br>Switzerland um and I decided to go back<br>this time to University of Cape Town to<br>as LEC to do the exercise science in um<br>at that University at honors level and<br>the reason why I did exercise science<br>was because that was the only postgrad<br>course that was available for physios in<br>beginning of the<br>1990s so it's by default that I did an<br>exercise science post grade and Tim no<br>did influence me and I think I created<br>my critical thinking skills from him and<br>also he absolutely<br>exemplified that the willingness to<br>change his own beliefs if evidence does<br>not stack up so he influenced me as a<br>researcher whereas um Matlin probably<br>influenced me as a<br>clinician after that I wasn't sure what<br>to do and I had a conversation with<br>Professor Pat Bank of the physia<br>department um and she suggested I apply<br>for a position that was open for<br>muscular scal Physio and I I don't know<br>what else to do I might as well try<br>teaching so everything in my career has<br>been very<br>circumstantial and I did start teaching<br>muscular at undergr level I did clinical<br>education in the out patients Department<br>of Cur and in retreat in the poor<br>communic um Community where our fourth<br>were placed and then i' worked in um<br>exercise science developed a master's<br>degree from the honors degree for Sports<br>Physio but then as it happens you meet<br>some somebody and you get married um he<br>graduated as a<br>physiotherapist and um we had Claud and<br>Sebastian and after Sebastian's birth I<br>resigned from University joined Chris in<br>his practice 207 Main Road rabos um I<br>worked three mornings a week um and then<br>looked after just because of<br>flexibility but I thought always thought<br>I wanted to get back to Academia and was<br>by pure coincidence that I saw an advert<br>from the University ofo I didn't really<br>know where it was was I knew where<br>danine was but but I wrote to<br>John and that email probably the email<br>or maybe it was a letter to John became<br>an application that became an interview<br>in person there was no Zoom at that<br>stage and that became an offer and then<br>it was really really tricky for us cuz<br>we didn't really want to we weren't<br>desperate to leave South Africa but this<br>was an opportunity for me um and in the<br>end we did decide we took the children<br>they did not have a choice they were two<br>and four um from their grandparents and<br>the extended family so the German foran<br>shaft and that was that was a big loss<br>that we had but we came here and met<br>many other people so and it's worked out<br>well I did complete the PHD as well and<br>that initially was part of the<br>attraction so I work in muscular scle<br>and Sports Physio and when I was a<br>student I wanted to be a pediatric<br>physio that's all I wanted<br>but then the opportunities that came up<br>when I needed an opportunity was all in<br>muscular scle and sports and that's how<br>I landed in this area we know that<br>muscular scal conditions are leading<br>causes of living with disability<br>globally it's not always obvious because<br>not everybody is limping or everybody's<br>walking with crutches it's often hidden<br>and the New Zealand stats also show the<br>high frequency of disability adjusted<br>life years for them so it is not it's<br>not more important important than any<br>other field but it is<br>important I'm in sports as well and<br>somebody May recognize that gentleman at<br>the front Sports not as all all about<br>winning it is about participation it's<br>about building communities it's about<br>social connections and it's that what<br>people lose when they get a serious<br>injury it's not just about the injury it<br>you can use it to build self-esteem that<br>then spreads to other areas of their<br>their life as well so there are many<br>benefits of keeping people active and<br>I'm interested in sports and it's sports<br>phys that often spend hours of voluntary<br>hour um hours um next to the sports<br>field to get people back to the sports<br>that they love so I think Sports pH yes<br>we all like the people running on the<br>field and the football World Cup but<br>that's only Pinnacle or only a few<br>physes who actually want to do that so<br>my there you've got the toes I'm not<br>going to talk about them<br>today but um I'll talk about the<br>concussion the shoulder injuries in the<br>knes but in the reverse order and in<br>research um we have to break questions<br>down into little bits little bit at a<br>time so if you explore ACL injuries you<br>might look at just at the movement at<br>the knee I'm doing that in the<br>biomechanics lab so that's the mechanism<br>of the injury we also have to of course<br>think about the person as such and their<br>role in society and that's what we're<br>doing with qualitative research so<br>interviewing people and stakeholders and<br>that's where the clinical studies come<br>in as well and then the last level that<br>I talked last about is the systems based<br>approach which came by chance in a sense<br>um concussion in schools so I'll talk<br>about all of<br>those so the problem with ACL injuries<br>is not the frequen they're not as<br>frequent as ankles brains or Cal strains<br>or hamstring strains but they have a<br>very long recovery time up to a year for<br>Community level for um<br>athletes um just over half of the people<br>with ACL um rupture return to<br>competitive sports for more than two<br>years so just over half and so quite<br>often they are offer surgery to get them<br>back to sports but the evidence shows<br>that it's actually not as high as as<br>what we would like so they do have that<br>long-term disability in a sense where<br>they can't get back to the levels where<br>they were beforehand has a highly injury<br>risk not only of the same knee but the<br>opposite knee is also at risk and there<br>is that long-term risk of ostearthritis<br>with concomitant decreased physical<br>activity and weight gain so an ACL<br>injury I say is not just the injury it's<br>a chronic health condition that we have<br>to and we have to find out how we can<br>particularly that chronic Health that<br>the long-term outcomes for some of them<br>not for all some do really well but<br>that's where the health need is in terms<br>of ACL reconstruction so we did<br>qualitative studies and labor based<br>studies and I do use students use them I<br>invite them onto my research and here<br>was Sarah Scott she's now actually<br>completed her PhD in a different topic<br>and Mand was my PhD candidate so Sarah<br>looked interviewed people less than two<br>years after reconstruction and Mand was<br>up to 10 years after the surgery and<br>they all spoke about a very convoluted<br>Journey it's not a straight path to get<br>to for Recovery they valued the<br>therapeutic alignance so the<br>relationship with the clinician was<br>could be a barrier but it was a very<br>strong<br>facilitator so in particular the physios<br>you often take time to to to get to know<br>the patients so that was absolutely<br>critical for the long term and also to<br>get them through the depressive times<br>that they get they often go through<br>support systems were the parents it was<br>the employees employers because often<br>they are on like Duty for long and then<br>those coaches and teams who made an<br>effort to keep them engaged so that was<br>important to them they did describe<br>severe loss of identity because these<br>were are often at Community level very<br>very passionate Sports people and then<br>they lose their position for up to a<br>year and that comes also with social<br>isolation and grieving and depression<br>and I think we as physios we need to<br>identify those low moods in our patients<br>when we work with him Mand in particular<br>explored that fear of reinjury there's a<br>high risk so that fear is rational it's<br>not an irrational fear um or anxiety or<br>hesitation whatever we want to call that<br>in physio we just speak in terms of<br>fear um so she wants to explore what<br>what is it about that injury that has<br>that high fear injury<br>and for most it's the pain it's<br>incredible but they just know something<br>severe has happened and you can see this<br>on the footballers um face here the pain<br>of the injury and then again when they<br>have surgery because it's an enormous<br>insult to the knee the surgery itself<br>and they spoke about the injury being<br>absolutely oh not the injury the injury<br>mechanism exactly what they were doing<br>remains imprinted in the mind and they<br>can't get rid of that and it's a<br>movement that subconsciously they just<br>avoid ever again<br>the social isol isolation and the long<br>rehab feeds into the fear because quite<br>often they have higher work commitments<br>they might have children that are<br>growing up that they think they will<br>never be able to go through another<br>surgery and another Rehabilitation again<br>so the fear is not only about the injury<br>itself it's about all the social aspects<br>that go with that injury that feeds into<br>it so we listened to those and some did<br>well others did not and in this study<br>with Kier Hood his honors um we wanted<br>to listen to people who thought that<br>they had done really well so what worked<br>well to get them back to where they<br>wanted to be and they are P they are<br>half the people at least do really well<br>and these are the three themes so the<br>first one is a driver for return to<br>sport these are people that say they<br>refuse to give up the athletic identity<br>and they absolutely mentally tough one<br>person was saying he was sitting at that<br>sideline after second injury and he said<br>to himself I I've done this I will do it<br>again and just that mental stamina was<br>was evident in them and they were<br>totally committed to their team and<br>didn't want to lose them<br>down they prepared the body as well as<br>the mind and the connected us that's<br>where the relationships come in is again<br>having a physio for example whom they<br>could text or email at any time and know<br>within a day or two that would get a<br>response just to have that Dr ins was<br>really important to them when they felt<br>vulnerable of course they describe a<br>physical rehab that's what our<br>profession is about but some of them<br>also spoke in detail about cognitive<br>skills from a mental skills coach but<br>most student patients don't have access<br>to that some had been in treatment<br>Elsewhere for mental wellness and then<br>use those skills in term to to get them<br>back to where they wanted so I think we<br>as physios we talk about psychologically<br>informed individual iions and those<br>should become more important even even<br>than what they're now at the end of the<br>day if the want should get back to sport<br>they just had to accept the risk and<br>some said it's fine I'll just do it I'm<br>just not worried um others spoke about<br>situational risk analysis where they<br>trained themselves to very quickly Split<br>Second make a decision whether they're<br>going to kick that ball or leave it so<br>um very quick decision making that they<br>learned and we really like this one<br>person said to coach said she can't get<br>back to the r team if she's not ready<br>for chaos and confusion and we added<br>that with confidence and I think that's<br>where as physic we often um fall through<br>a bit we want perfect beautiful movement<br>patterns but here we have to prepare<br>them for<br>unpredictability in any direction even<br>in the non-standard beautiful um<br>movements so less focus on perfect<br>movement patterns more focus on<br>unpredictability I think that is crucial<br>to get these back to their sport or to<br>their<br>work so those were qualitative studies<br>and this is now the laboratory study<br>where we did a cross-sectional study<br>it's part of M's um PhD study so she<br>recruited 24 25 participants with ACL<br>reconstructions up to 10 years post op<br>and 24 controls and as you would expect<br>they had weaker quads and hemps on the<br>inured side compared to the uned side um<br>and also compared to the cont TOS that's<br>not surprising at all and the quality of<br>life so the C is a question there we can<br>give people with knee pain and the<br>quality of life section was very low in<br>the ACL cohort 47 compared to 80 out of<br>100 cohorts normally in studies are<br>between 80 and 90 maybe 95 so but<br>there's a large standard deviation for<br>the injured ones so some did well but<br>there is a cohort of people with ACL<br>injuries who in the long term don't do<br>well<br>we also ask the people to walk up and<br>down those steps movement analysis<br>cameras around them there's a force<br>plate in the ground and the skin markers<br>are picked up by the cameras<br>and we found that they were walking up<br>and down the step with a stiffer knee so<br>less knee flexion and lower knee flexion<br>moments so that indicates that there's a<br>persistent subconscious protection or<br>unloading of the knee even up to 10<br>years after the injury so these really<br>have long-term consequences to for some<br>people so in M's qualitative study some<br>participants said to help them with fear<br>or give them confidence they used a knee<br>brace or a sleeve as part when they're<br>training or when they are feeling<br>vulnerable and then we decideed well we<br>want to see whether these theves really<br>do make a difference because it's<br>elastic it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't<br>support the knee as such it doesn't<br>chain stabilize it and happened again by<br>chance have a con a conversation with<br>Neil hmer who was in the department of<br>anatomy who had had link to a commercial<br>company in Germany called bind who had<br>an e Lea so we contacted them and they<br>were happy to fund us but other than<br>that they weren't involved in the study<br>at all but I reported to them so for<br>that one we had 34 pars up to five years<br>and we use this a different activity so<br>the person was standing on the box and<br>then we ask them to step down very fast<br>and hop forwards and that's what it<br>looks<br>like and we were interested in what is<br>happening at the knee during that stance<br>phase but they did not know what we were<br>looking for and we didn't give them any<br>instructions we just say it as fast as<br>they can so the black line here is the<br>knee flexion angle so at in at contact<br>the knee is normally in about 10° of<br>extension you drop down to about 40 45°<br>and then the knee extends as the person<br>jumps forward so the black line is the<br>control or the opposite side the<br>opposite un ined side the red line is<br>the knee angle for the in side so you<br>see that it's slightly lower so less<br>knee flexion the green L line is for<br>with the knee sleeve so there you see it<br>moves back towards the more um black<br>line so on obser observation it looks as<br>though it makes a difference and it<br>actually does so um this is statistic<br>parametric mapping and comparing the<br>unsleeved uninjured side to the in to<br>the uninjured side the STA the<br>significant difference is Midway so it's<br>over here at Peak flexion so they had 4°<br>less flexion on average um without the<br>knee sleeve with the KN sleeve the area<br>of Interest was in the first third so<br>from touchdown<br>um a few seconds and that is where most<br>of the ACL injuries occur it's in that<br>Split Second as soon as a person land so<br>basically what we've shown is that the<br>KNE theve can change the movement<br>patterns without telling the person<br>about it at all and we often train<br>people to to land with a softer knee and<br>the studies show that it only approves<br>by about 3° and that's exactly what the<br>knee sleeve did so I'm not saying that<br>we have to use a knee sleeve for<br>everybody cuz exercise is still the<br>first part but in some people it might<br>be useful to to give them confidence as<br>a tool just as a one tool in the rehab<br>so probably what happens so we did find<br>that increased knee flexion and learning<br>with the softer knee in other variable<br>that we looked up at that also showed<br>increased control in that first Split<br>Second um on Manning and that's where<br>the ACL injuries occur so probably if<br>you have fear you afraid of an injury we<br>all start moving a bit stiffer and we<br>start moving slower and we get less less<br>active so the movement patterns change<br>activity change just add a little bit of<br>confidence and perhaps that is enough in<br>some people to sort of normalize the<br>movement and motivate them to get<br>active so that's what that study showed<br>so overall for all the ACL rehab<br>rehabilitation is never complete it's a<br>long-term rehab that's needed perhaps<br>booster sessions in the long term<br>somebody who they can contact for advice<br>they need to strengthen and maintain the<br>thigh strength in the long term because<br>we they normally increase and then after<br>2 years it goes down in particular when<br>they drop out of the sports we need to<br>do everything we can to boost their<br>confidence um and perhaps for some an e<br>can be helpful but exercise will always<br>remain the main thing we have to address<br>the beliefs and the anxieties and also<br>help them to change to another sport<br>that can Inspire them if they do have to<br>drop out<br>and sometimes in research I think Nadine<br>you see in research um there's sometimes<br>this interest maybe CH these interesting<br>other things you find and what we found<br>in our volunteers that 30% of them were<br>obese they had a BMI over 300 my deep<br>study it was 60% that were either<br>overweight or obese as opposed to 30%<br>for the controls so this is being<br>described at the moment internationally<br>weight gain after an ACL injury and and<br>physical activity and that's why I say<br>it is a chronic health condition in some<br>of of these people but not all so if<br>you're sitting with an ACL injury it's<br>not all bad news but we have to be aware<br>of<br>that so that was my KN research now<br>we're coming to the<br>shoulder and here I also do experimental<br>pain um work and then the whole person<br>and in the laboratory this comes from<br>Craig bent's work we happen to have an A<br>talk with David backer at a conference<br>and said that he would want to come here<br>as a post do and that was possible so he<br>and his wife Kate came over and we had<br>common interest in shoulders so we<br>started the study to do biomechanical<br>studies on acute pain you will never get<br>a person with AC an acute injury into<br>the lab it's not safe and the person<br>probably wouldn't volunteer anyway so<br>that's why we use the experimental pain<br>study the way we do that we take half a<br>teaspoon full of salt water and inject<br>it in the back and that's what Dr H<br>Osborne did for us so you have two<br>conditions experimental pain condition<br>and control and there's a crossover try<br>and we did quite a few in those 15<br>minutes of the pain after 15 minutes the<br>pain is gone um although they don't<br>believe it while the pain is they<br>cloudly was a participant um so you have<br>to do as much as you can in those 15<br>minutes so I'll show you just samples so<br>here the blue line is the control<br>condition the red is the p pain and this<br>side here is for the muscle strength we<br>call it torque so sitting twisting out<br>and twisting in external inter rotation<br>there was an immediate drop in strength<br>as you would imagine for somebody who's<br>got pain and the throw index was how<br>often they got that ball into the box<br>the accuracy and that also drop at<br>20% and that's exactly what we find in<br>people with with pain with should with a<br>real injury so often people can have<br>pain and it's the pain that inhibits the<br>strength it's not a change in the muscle<br>it's a change in the brain so see it's<br>governed by the<br>brain we did prop perception as well<br>because we physio like the word prop<br>perception and one variable we can look<br>at is emotion sense so that's where the<br>person sits arms and the lever<br>blindfolded they they hear white noise<br>so that they don't know what's going on<br>and the lever slowly starts turning half<br>half a second half a degree a second and<br>they press on the other hand as soon as<br>they know that the arm is moving and<br>whether it's moving out or in and our<br>hypothesis was that in pain it would<br>take longer because that's what decrease<br>proception would be but we were<br>surprised and the pain here we had an<br>ABA design so the pain condition they<br>responded faster which means that prop<br>perception was enhanced and it does make<br>sense because if somebody has a s arm<br>and they just do a small movement<br>they'll immediately grab that arm so we<br>as physios kind assume that prop<br>perception is always worse in these<br>patients and I'm I queried this in a<br>book chapter that I was asked to write<br>in the should in a shoulder book um and<br>I'm stared to query do we actually need<br>prop perceptive<br>exercise because every exercise we do<br>entails Pro perception so I think we<br>need to simplify our our our reasoning<br>in terms of of um exercise prescription<br>so after those studies we were suddenly<br>contacted by somebody called janas from<br>from Laval University and asked whether<br>he can come here I think was because we<br>could get um ethics for this this kind<br>of work and bring his own equipment I<br>said of course he's most welcome so we<br>knocked on H's door again Craig came<br>back on a sabatical now with two goals<br>as well and federick ji was the um ra<br>she's now PhD student and we had lots of<br>fun in the LA together while some people<br>had<br>pain so um this was more sophisticated<br>with inertial senses and mg and this is<br>what it looked like to the<br>that so here the instruction was they<br>had to move as accurately and as fast as<br>possible to follow the ball and it was<br>unpredictable and that is really<br>important they did not know what the<br>next movement<br>was and so that is more relevant to to<br>sports related um movements or work<br>related and we did find find that they<br>were slower and less accurate they moved<br>with a stiffer arm like ACL people walk<br>with a stiffer knee that had less<br>flexion in the shoulder but not only the<br>shoulder the elbow also moved less so<br>everything was stiffer and then of<br>course they use more trunk movement when<br>looking at MG the top line and I've<br>warped these so that there's more of a<br>dynamic you see the control it took<br>faster and the in in the pain could have<br>that was slower so in the control<br>condition the amplitude muscle activity<br>for the muscle up here increases sharply<br>and then decreases again for the control<br>group it works harder if you look at<br>those units 1.5 versus 2 for the um it's<br>an arbitrary unit and also they take<br>longer and they get longer to reach that<br>Peak so they become far more CES and<br>that also held up with the mean of the<br>of the<br>conditions so what do these studies show<br>well experimental studies seldom tell us<br>what we should change in clinical<br>practice but they add to our our<br>understanding so it's likely a<br>protective mechanism controlled by the<br>brain that's what you see in those<br>immediate<br>changes another observation was that<br>there was enormous variability of the<br>scapular movements and that also comes<br>from another PhD students work Sor Tong<br>gr physios we always look at the<br>humorous cap of Rhythm and think this<br>should be a perfect pattern but that<br>does not hold up in real life there's<br>enormous variability so again I think as<br>a physi should think about these perfect<br>movement patterns that we want to try to<br>achieve already said we need to think<br>about prop perceptive exercise and then<br>for function shoulder Excel should be<br>done in multiple directions multiple<br>speeds multiple variations think about<br>this person has to work with an animal<br>who can be very unexpected or the sports<br>person so that was laboratory by studies<br>now coming to the clinical<br>study I call this the otag shoulder<br>Health re research pathway and the<br>acronym is oo my family knows why oo is<br>so important it's the oo chocolate um<br>but um the problem with this kind it's<br>also called shoulder impingement and the<br>problem with this condition is we don't<br>always know exactly what is going on in<br>the shoulder one of the reason is that<br>many of you whoever is 50 years and<br>older if they 10 of you one of you will<br>have a partial rat CER and you won't<br>even know it and if you know it it won't<br>predict whether you will have pain or<br>not so in a group of people where<br>there's are people who circumstantially<br>find out that there's something wrong in<br>the shoulder either r cfer or maybe of<br>the laum and then those who don't have<br>anything we don't know who is going to<br>be the person who's got the pain so as a<br>physio we screen out reasons to to refer<br>the patient to a doctor making sure<br>there's nothing something else is going<br>on but then we treat the patient we<br>assess the patient and prescribe<br>exercise Mania therapy according to that<br>and international best practi is patient<br>education I call them clinical<br>conversations exercise and staying<br>active and then man theapy as a very<br>important<br>adjunct um often to help them to get<br>active so the kopa of this pathway is to<br>develop non-surgical care for people<br>with rotat cuff um related Al the pain<br>that focus on self management and is<br>relevant for Alo New Zealand and the<br>self-management is important because<br>this kind of pain often comes back it's<br>like a cold or a flu that's what Jeremy<br>Lewis says a a UK specialist it's like a<br>cold comes back it's not necessarily<br>worse it's not necessarily progressing<br>so the patient needs to know what to do<br>for themselves so this is the pathway<br>and I just on this program want to show<br>you the the funding you start with very<br>small funding from physio New Zealand NZ<br>MPA then I had a Jack Thompson arthritis<br>Grant then it grew a little bit more to<br>an HC activation Grant then the Stanley<br>Paris and now a threeyear hlc so from<br>2015 to now to it took eight years to<br>get an HC project um and I do thank the<br>full team everybody along that whole<br>pathway that helped towards it so in the<br>first two studies again I've got honor<br>student Melissa Gillespie we we<br>recruited 10 participants and She<br>interviewed them to find out what they<br>think is going on in the shoulder and<br>they all said it's in the shoulder<br>that's a problem you need to fix my<br>shoulder in 2015 when we wrote the grun<br>pain Neuroscience education was a big<br>new thing but um it was more it's common<br>for really chronic pain but we were<br>starting to to use that for people with<br>persistent pain as well so I wanted to<br>develop a tool that was re relevant for<br>this people and I developed PowerPoint<br>site was up to an hour including<br>conversation with the patient to find<br>out what was relevant for them and then<br>we followed up um every week for three<br>weeks so they came in just for a few<br>minutes if just in case they had any<br>questions and we re um interviewed them<br>3 weeks later and what I found that they<br>were more aware of factors that<br>influence the pain and they seemed to be<br>able to control the pain better and they<br>were not worrying that much<br>but the pain was still there so that<br>they still wanted to know what what how<br>we can fix them so the next one I want<br>so that was a proof of concept of<br>whether patients can accept that but an<br>hour is very long it's very heavy so I<br>broke it down into smaller pieces again<br>PowerPoint slides and then videos as<br>well the patients could watch it home<br>and we did add the anatomy and path<br>Anatomy because that's what patient want<br>to know they want to know how the<br>shoulder looks and what might be going<br>on and then we added 10 minutes on what<br>they can do themselves and then this<br>time Rosie AKA honor student She<br>interviewed them after so we integrated<br>that in physiotherapy so eight sessions<br>of usual Physiotherapy in our clinics<br>and the the physios had to use the<br>PowerPoint sites and patients could<br>watch the videos and the patients were<br>interviewed afterwards and without<br>exceptions all of them spoke very highly<br>of the physiotherapist so the patient<br>physio report was really important to<br>them and I think by talking more with<br>his phys giving them more information<br>asking them bouncing back and forth that<br>probably helped with with developing<br>that<br>Rapport but there were two groups of<br>them some of them in the middle one some<br>of them thought this was absolutely<br>fantastic changed their mind about the<br>their insight about what pain is<br>actually about the other half thought<br>it's not for them and that's what we see<br>in other uh studies as well but at the<br>end of the day all of them regardless<br>what direction they came they felt they<br>were more in control they knew what to<br>do for the shoulder they had more hope<br>and they had less worry so I think<br>sometimes if we share some information<br>with P it has to be relevant for them<br>but sometimes they think it's not for<br>them but subconsciously there's some<br>like the students when they learn some<br>Learning Happens<br>subconsciously so that was a feasibility<br>to see whether we can<br>integrate their those resources into<br>Physio and then decided yes it can it<br>seemed like it but then we wanted a web<br>site and for this one we used a new<br>methodology where Ali Calder was our<br>methods person participatory action<br>research so instead of us deciding what<br>needed to be on the website we asked<br>people with shoulder pain there's at<br>least one in the room here um and and<br>physiotherapists so we had Tracy Pon is<br>a physiotherapy specialist in pain and<br>Nancy Longnecker is Professor in science<br>communication and here Roa was now an<br>early graduate and this is Stuart mckin<br>from our media unit and Janie Steen was<br>on our ra um in my kitchen at home<br>filming something I was in the model<br>because nobody else wanted to be the<br>model but the patients told me that's<br>what they wanted so we were the research<br>team were absolutely nervous at the<br>beginning because we couldn't make<br>decisions we had to listen to others but<br>in the end it was an absolute it was so<br>much fun five meetings where with the<br>stakeholders and then everybody had<br>homework in between and we eventually<br>came to this website um and it's hosted<br>by Turbo web which is here in in Den so<br>it is it is available already it is very<br>much focused on New Zealand and on our<br>health system and we are now using it as<br>a tool in the next studies so every part<br>of the study Builds on the other<br>one so last slide on the shoulder this<br>is what we're doing at the moment so for<br>the stainy Paris<br>Fellowship that Fellowship has to be<br>aligned with manual therapy that's<br>that's the important brief and what are<br>we doing here we want to see for people<br>with that R cuff pain we want to see<br>with a manual therapy adding that to<br>usual physio which is the education<br>self-management exercise prescription<br>whether manual therapy has any added<br>benefit it is a pilot study only 60<br>patients but it will give us indication<br>of firstly whether a larger study can be<br>done and what the effect or the benefit<br>of man therapy will we'll only be able<br>to answer that in a larger study but<br>it's the starting point and we are<br>integrating that website into the study<br>as well and just to say thank you to the<br>physio clinics here in the school and<br>Christ Church physio um who are the<br>providers and then it's the step care<br>that Lee mentioned um that's the hlc<br>study so here we will have 200 patients<br>and add um focus physia in myatu in a ma<br>predominantly Mai area and Oakland<br>shoulder clinic and problem with step<br>with with ret C related shoulder pain<br>it's often patients that can't get ACC<br>so they either have to pay themselves or<br>they have to go to theat order where<br>there's often a long waiting list and to<br>get those people through quicker you<br>offer only one or two sessions and then<br>follow up with them and then give<br>physiotherapy to those who actually<br>still need it and that's exactly what<br>we'll do here one group will have<br>pragmatic physio immediately exactly<br>like this group here and the other will<br>will be offered two sessions and we will<br>catch up with them at six weeks and then<br>offer them more if they need it so I<br>can't say more of that and we have<br>Christina Douglas who's our very valued<br>project manager for those<br>two so last one is the<br>concussion now I got into concussion by<br>default because John was part of the New<br>Zealand RP research group and when he<br>went on retirement he asked me whether I<br>would like to join that that study<br>mainly being the ethics holder and of<br>course I said yes and I started working<br>with Danielle salmon and aut colleagues<br>and at that time L and dby was assessing<br>how good the concussion management<br>pathway works and those were the studies<br>that were doing at that time one of the<br>findings was that they often lost<br>students with concussion at school where<br>schools had no idea how to look after<br>them support them and get them back to<br>learning not and and also get them back<br>to sport<br>so we started this it's called the Frank<br>study and it's not funded by New Zealand<br>Rugby and this is definitely Beyond<br>rugby it does include rugby players But<br>it includes any person with concussion<br>at school could be two people banging<br>their heads which has happened this year<br>um uh racing to get their their Ruck<br>saxs so over four we now in the fourth<br>year in the first year we work with two<br>schools in Oakland and three here to<br>find out from them what is work working<br>what is not working and what might work<br>um so yes the attitudes were very<br>different across the schools um some<br>thought it's not a problem at all why<br>waste your time others thought it was<br>absolutely critical but they didn't know<br>what to do with it very different<br>Healthcare access up north all schools<br>have a nurse here we don't um concussion<br>education was sometimes given most times<br>not and of course the schools all have<br>very different resources so we worked<br>with them we interviewed I think was one<br>123 um participants and with them we<br>designed a a framework that can work and<br>is adaptable for for each school it's<br>basically just a pro a process from<br>having an email and then having a person<br>who answers that email and then that<br>person letting the right teacher and D<br>know and then checking in with the<br>student every week to make sure they're<br>getting better that they have seen the<br>GP or or not it's simple but adaptable<br>and then 2022 we um um implemented in<br>five schools and last year we um worked<br>with seven schools so we've now worked<br>together with 14 Schools across the<br>country um postco Oakland was really<br>difficult with non intendance so<br>concussion was not an issue at all not a<br>problem for the schools that more<br>important problems as as in Hawks Bay<br>with a<br>flooding so we now have an agency<br>activation Grant to develop more formal<br>resources and will roll it out to the<br>whole<br>country and I think that study probably<br>will be the most meaningful that I've<br>done for a long time because there's a<br>real tangible outcome so take home<br>messages for<br>researchers grow your network but it<br>does take time sometimes these<br>relationship come by chance and must be<br>people that you can work with keep your<br>peripheral vision open because nothing<br>that I ever did was what I wanted it<br>just when I needed something there was<br>something there so yes have a plan but<br>be willing to change it opportunities<br>often come including of Grants come at<br>unexpected times keep a broader platform<br>to remain flexible if there's a change<br>in funding or change in the health needs<br>of New Zealand so I've got different<br>methods that I work with and and<br>different areas of the body in a sense<br>that we're looking at clinicians listen<br>to your patients don't blame<br>them build their confidence to move and<br>self-manage the pain wherever that's POS<br>possible and my big thing is progress<br>towards unpredictability in exercise not<br>just the perfect movement pattern terms<br>of patience if there's somebody here<br>with pain movement is important for<br>health and for your injury the most<br>important injur exercise is the one that<br>you'll actually do I think we all know<br>that and you as a person has a say what<br>that exercise should be all physical<br>activity seek a healthc care<br>professional that listens to you who can<br>take the time and who helps you to<br>understand what you can do yourself<br>have thank<br>you first to my<br>family first people to to say thank you<br>of my family Chris had to sell his<br>practice in rabos we sold our little<br>cottage road to come here as I said you<br>didn't have a choice but you had to come<br>and as you see on this one here we're<br>perfectly acclimatized to the<br>needen um Claudia Sebastian had<br>wonderful opportunities here and Claudia<br>is now back going from an occupational<br>therapist the primary school teacher and<br>of course we've really we really do love<br>the environment<br>here um our staff thank you for your<br>support collegiality and also<br>friendships work is not only about work<br>it's also part of our life and it's also<br>about friendships some people are not<br>with us anymore they've left us others<br>will be leaving and others have come<br>since then our students you are why most<br>of us are here most of the time and you<br>inspire us um and also the postgrad<br>students um the sports Medics there<br>might be some here as well this is when<br>the um football tournament was here last<br>year in the Swiss team that was based in<br>denen their physios were willing to come<br>and talk to us students which was great<br>our family friends there not everybody<br>but representatives of them um so ker<br>tan um Mah Hut arot town just at home um<br>you basically our extended<br>family and then the communities St<br>John's Rosland where that we joined when<br>we arrived um children have moved on and<br>that's fine um the running Community is<br>absolutely critical particular to keep<br>Chris and Claudia say and active um and<br>cl zasan and I on the sidelines and then<br>Denine city choir that's really connects<br>me with my music there always only two<br>things I have to do do what the<br>conductor here thalma is here as well<br>and Colin um do what the conductor says<br>and stay in<br>tune and we've got a concert coming up<br>and then of course all the people in<br>research that I've worked with starting<br>with with my PhD supervisors Stefan<br>isn't here but John and Helen are here<br>so I'm very lucky to have you here um my<br>own PhD students or those that I<br>co-supervise not they more I just<br>couldn't fit them in the ACL group on<br>this side seems be mainly males um but<br>they are women involved as well the<br>Franks concussion group here these Ras<br>were absolutely critical because they<br>were working in in the schools and then<br>all on the side is mainly shoulder<br>related so after a while you start<br>working with up to 50 people and I found<br>that quite quite humbling and I'm<br>standing here but it's everybody who who<br>we who we are actually<br>celebrating so I end off with this quote<br>there's beuty differences in strength<br>and<br>unity that comes from a TV program that<br>you all should look at the chattam<br>island about Mai marori and the Paka and<br>our our differences are different<br>nationalities different parts of<br>physiotherapy we've got clinicians we've<br>got researchers statisticians patients<br>stakeholders and those we need to be<br>different we can't all be the same and<br>our<br>Unity is that's our research outputs and<br>impact and our students because that's<br>why we ultimately here and that is what<br>is our strength so I leave you with that<br>t<br>thanks Nami Nei Giza thank you very much<br>for an excellent lecture and there was a<br>lot in there wasn't there so thank you<br>um it was lovely to hear about your<br>family and your journey and I guess the<br>message is that sometimes opportunities<br>come and we have the choice to either<br>take them or not and I think you've<br>shown us that it's important to take<br>those<br>opportunities I think many of us in the<br>room can relate to your story I think<br>many of us um don't end up where we<br>thought we would be at the end of high<br>school so I think we can relate to that<br>we've learned a lot I think about common<br>injuries um and how you can manage them<br>most of you know that I'm an anatomist<br>by background so for me it's really<br>important it's really good to see the<br>clinical applications of anatomy both<br>the anatomy of the various joints and<br>heads but also the neuro Anatomy that's<br>important the importance of sensory<br>motor and<br>proception I think one of the things<br>that's come out of your talk is the<br>importance of a holistic approach to any<br>injury and the importance of not just<br>thinking about the the joint or the head<br>that may be injured but the importance<br>of thinking of the patients well-being<br>their mental state um and the social<br>factors that will impact their recovery<br>or not as the case may be um and and I<br>think sometimes we we we don't take that<br>holistic approach so it's really<br>important I think it's it's been really<br>interesting to see the breadth of your<br>research both in terms of lab-based<br>studies action research and clinical<br>research we need all three of those to<br>actually help people get better and to<br>move<br>more you talked about your take-home<br>messages so I think for us who are<br>patients it's important that we find a<br>clinician that we can talk<br>to who understands us and that we trust<br>for our clinicians I think it goes<br>without saying that we we train our<br>students to listen to patients and<br>that's really important um and to be<br>realistic and understand the other<br>factors that may be impinging on our<br>patients<br>lives and then of course for our<br>Searchers we really do need to build<br>networks and be nimble and think more<br>broadly so perhaps the final message is<br>that all of us need to keep moving and<br>to move effectively as we as we um live<br>our lives so thank you um I'd like to<br>call you up and give you a small token<br>of our appreciation and I'd like to<br>everybody to thank Giza again thank you<br>thank<br>you<br>so my last task is to thank you all for<br>coming and to invite you all to join me<br>and gizela and her family at the staff<br>club for some refreshments where you can<br>actually talk to Giza and the family and<br>tell her what a good job she's done so<br>please come and join me in the staff<br>Club</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
