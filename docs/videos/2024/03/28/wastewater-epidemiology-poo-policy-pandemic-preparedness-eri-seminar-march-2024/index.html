WBE is an effective way to undertake multi-pathogen surveillance, capturing the signal from many individuals, including those who are pre- and asymptomatic, in a single sample. Compared to conventional clinical testing, it is highly cost-effective and relatively unbiased, simultaneously capturing data from all societal sectors, regardless of factors such as demographics and economic status.<br><br>The presentation will showcase the WEWASH Programme, a collaborative initiative between Cardiff and Bangor Universities in partnership with Dŵr Cymru/Welsh Water. Established as a pilot project in 2020 and funded by the Welsh Government, the Programme expanded to monitor approximately 50 wastewater treatment facilities and nine major hospitals across Wales. Sampling these sites 3-5 times per week and reporting weekly, WEWASH has transitioned from its initial focus on monitoring SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater using RT-PCR, to currently providing data on SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as other viruses (e.g., influenza A, enterovirus, RSV, norovirus genotypes GI and GII), key bacterial pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) markers. The lessons learned from WEWASH will be discussed, particularly in terms of linking research/innovation and big data sharing, with Government to inform public health policies. The wider challenges of WBE will also be considered, including the disjointed nature of current WBE initiatives that has resulted from poor integration of data linking to traditional clinical health surveillance.<br><br>Andy Weightman is a Professor of Microbiology in the School of Biosciences who investigates microbial communities in the natural environment, particularly with regard to adaptation of microbes to environmental challenge in aquatic ecosystems. Andy’s work has spanned studying of microbiota from the deep sub-seafloor biosphere through to microbial and ecosystem adaptation to environmental contamination with halogenated compounds. During the COVID19 pandemic, Andy was heavily involved in the Welsh government’s wastewater surveillance testing, which has now been expanded to track dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes.

of people walking and like minutes<br>because that's what always happens with<br>these things but um thanks very much<br>Andy for coming and giving the ER<br>seminar um are we recording this as well<br>yeah it's started I will turn up the the<br>banter at the beginning yeah lovely<br>thanks so yeah that means that people<br>can check it out later on as well if<br>they haven't teaching would been able to<br>M come in person um so Andy's a<br>professor of biosciences at University<br>of Cardiff I got to know Andy through<br>the<br>cff what's called strategic initiative<br>and um he's been part of the XNA project<br>a little bit prolifer peripherally um<br>with giving some sequences from the deep<br>CA biosphere project and so been had a<br>look for add end on to that but today's<br>going to be talking about has worked<br>with the Welsh government on Wastewater<br>testing for Co covid-19 and uh I think<br>this is just a fantastic title I'm quite<br>on to that yeah yeah thanks very much<br>okay well thanks thanks for the<br>invitation it's it's lovely to be here<br>um I'm not sure I mean in some ways I'm<br>here and some ways I'm mid Pacific some<br>oh I don't know where I am to be honest<br>but I arrived yesterday sun shining you<br>know what's not to like so thank you<br>very much um and what I'll be as Adele<br>has said what I'll be talking about uh<br>today is really just the what we' call<br>the wewash program which stands it's<br>it's a shortened form of whales<br>Wastewater Sentinels for health and<br>environmental surveillance but really<br>started under covid as I'll explain and<br>just to illustrate I hope some of the um<br>uh the the the the benefits and the<br>challenges of working uh with with<br>government and particular the Welsh<br>government um how we've uh how we've<br>progressed that and where we are at the<br>moment indeed so the there is a<br>Wastewater program and has been for some<br>time in in New Zealand um I can't<br>remember the initials of the<br>organization that runs that it's uh ESR<br>or something something yeah yeah<br>um and they're still uh they're still<br>running I saw that the report for uh for<br>January um we're in a sort of we're in a<br>bit of limbo at the moment we're just<br>running towards the end of March and<br>we're not quite sure what's happening<br>politically but more about that and on<br>so<br>oh oh there we there we are so um it'll<br>be a lot about Wastewater poo and uh a<br>tiny bit about how that's sort of<br>translated in terms of policy and<br>pandemic preparedness is where the whole<br>world should be at at the moment not not<br>necessarily for another virus um<br>pandemic but AMR is in the background<br>always has been and these sorts of<br>things you know need some uh need some<br>sort of serious consideration<br>obviously so the original project um<br>started through a conversation that I<br>had with a colleague at the University<br>of Banger Dave Jones uh who's a soil<br>microbiologist and has been working on<br>uh environmental virology through a a a<br>a postdoctoral fellow called Kata farus<br>and um liasing with uh various<br>colleagues in water utilities Welsh<br>water in particular and this map just<br>shows the area that's covered by Welsh<br>water and the blobs are the Waste Water<br>treatment works uh large medium and and<br>small uh across the whole of Wales the<br>main water treatment works are um in<br>Cardiff and uh for the south of Wales<br>and rexon for the north of Wales but as<br>you can see there are hundreds of the<br>things and decision that we had to make<br>early on was how many to to to look at<br>it also involved um funding from Welsh<br>government so relatively quickly and<br>this was great they responded um in<br>England there was a project that was<br>going on at the the same time but<br>probably not as well coordinated in<br>terms of links between government and<br>public health so we involved the public<br>health Wales and duy Welsh waterer is<br>the main water company for Wales but<br>there's also a seven Trent outlet that<br>um that controls this area of of<br>Wales as you probably know um or as you<br>might know waste these days Wastewater<br>can be used to measure all the um<br>activities of of society really we can<br>look at what we're producing in terms of<br>waste uh chemical Pharmaceuticals<br>antibiotics uh you can measure um uh<br>product from uh that have come in<br>through um uh through being thrown into<br>the Wastewater or just uh derivatives of<br>of human activity in in some shape or<br>form endocrine disruptors hormones and<br>so on and um pathogens pathogenic<br>bacteria pathogenic um uh viruses as<br>well and Wastewater based epidemiology<br>therefore had been uh is a concept that<br>and and had been applied quite widely<br>but the question was and had been used<br>for in various ways and to look at polio<br>virus in particular I'll mention that in<br>a moment<br>asymptomatic and and<br>presymptomatic and data existed for some<br>viruses particularly norovirus so in in<br>banga they were doing quite a lot of<br>work looking at norovirus in in the in<br>the Wastewater but at the outet it<br>wasn't really known whether you could<br>measure um sarov 2 virus the covid virus<br>in Wastewater so would this work for<br>sasov 2 not necessarily<br>Obviously good to look at in Wastewater<br>because it's a respiratory virus you<br>know to what extent would it be<br>transmitted through Wastewater would it<br>come through urine would it come through<br>fees it turned out of course it was<br>quite easy to detect it in feal matter<br>and therefore in<br>Wastewater so surveillance using<br>Wastewater were developed in the in the<br>1940s so way back<br>um cell culture methods were used to<br>isolate polio virus from Wastewater and<br>that was really and and I supposed uh<br>bit of work with hepatitis A in the US<br>in the 1980s but things really changed<br>with the Advent of the poas Chain<br>Reaction PCR where we could start to<br>design primers for all sorts of<br>different agents in Wastewater and<br>particularly taking up the work with<br>hepatitis hepatitis A and norovirus and<br>polio through the uh through the<br>2000s but the thing that's given it real<br>impetus and I think hopefully will be<br>good for the the future a legacy as it<br>were of something that was really uh<br>terrible is uh the as a legacy of the co<br>covid-19<br>pandemic and this shows some early work<br>it actually was published but quite late<br>in let me see now in 2020 of course but<br>this was done by by um the um uh medma<br>group in in the Netherlands and I<br>remember seeing a presentation it was<br>Town Hall so-called Town Hall<br>presentation EU Town Hall presentation<br>online and um uh Gan was was talking<br>about the uh the work that they've done<br>around two no three wastewater treatment<br>works in around utre and and Amsterdam<br>in the Netherlands and what this figure<br>shows is the number of rep cases that<br>were occurring right then back in the P<br>pandemic I mean before lockdown in the<br>UK and I can't remember when lockdown<br>happened in in New Zealand but uh you<br>know relative early stages late February<br>early March and you can see the cases uh<br>increasing um scale on the left hand<br>side here and then the the virus<br>detection sasov 2 virus detection which<br>was fairly rudimentary at that stage in<br>wastewater treatment works around utre<br>and Amsterdam showing the gene top is<br>per Mill of Wastewater uh on on the log<br>scale on on the right hand side so this<br>was really the the gave gave us the the<br>confidence to invest quite a bit of<br>effort and and governments to put quite<br>a bit of money into detecting the virus<br>in Wastewater in other<br>countries so um just this is a summary<br>of how the program has as it were<br>developed and where we are now through<br>about five phases of um of of the<br>program starting in although we were<br>talking to Welsh government back in uh<br>March April of 2022 but the funding<br>really started to come on stream in in<br>July for a pilot project and then<br>through these phases to where we are now<br>and I'll say a bit about that at the end<br>but the total funding is something that<br>for for the whole program and the and<br>the partners that we involved are shown<br>on on the right hand side um is is<br>really so substantial for I don't think<br>I've ever had funding like that that's<br>been given so quickly for any sort of<br>project and that was split mainly<br>between between Banger and and Cardiff<br>over the period so that's definitely an<br>upside um the the challenges are really<br>how do you get the information in in a<br>in a usable form to Welsh government and<br>to Public Health officials and what<br>government tends to do is to set up<br>these huge<br>organizations uh or rather project uh<br>management and so we suddenly became a<br>supplier to the user groups and I<br>suppose that it's particularly in the<br>early stages a problem was that as<br>suppliers we were supplying data and<br>information to users who were the public<br>health uh uh scientists and the public<br>health officials and Welsh government<br>was um managing that relationship and we<br>weren't really talking directly IR L uh<br>at first anyway to the people involved<br>it also involved technical Advisory<br>Group which was the kind of uh providing<br>scientific advice to Welsh government<br>that Davey and I both uh sit on and<br>um test trace and protect which was<br>basically doing um clinical analysis in<br>the in the community um and we had to<br>interact with chief medical officer and<br>uh the chief scientific officer for<br>health who's Rob Oren really great<br>people who put a lot of time and effort<br>into the project and and allowing us to<br>move at PACE because there was a lot of<br>innovation required as well and I know a<br>lot of countries were doing this work<br>not least uh uh New Zealand European<br>countries across the the states but it<br>was difficult to coordinate it at the<br>time because of the uh because of the<br>pandemic and we we were lucky we had<br>quite a bit of publicity uh that helped<br>us uh raise the profile of the program<br>on the BBC and and and locally and the<br>benefits of doing this I think were<br>fairly evident from from the beginning<br>it was going to be and is um and we can<br>show this now much more Co coste<br>effective than doing surveillance by uh<br>by testing um uh asymptom catches<br>asymptomatic as well as symptomatic and<br>presymptomatic individuals automation uh<br>as we introduced it robotics for example<br>allowed us to processar large numbers of<br>samples relatively quickly<br>non-discriminatory so these these<br>factors I think are particularly<br>important by comparison with the<br>problems we faced with with with testing<br>individuals by PCR and the lateral flow<br>test and getting those data back from<br>all sectors of society that waste water<br>everyone has to P waste water is<br>non-discriminatory independent of Health<br>seeking behaviors and independent of<br>clinical testing and that's really<br>important particularly when you're<br>looking at some sectors of society uh<br>some are is geographical within the<br>within the within Wales in particular<br>and the question as well at the<br>beginning although I don't think this is<br>I think the evidence lies rather on on<br>both sides were we able to use it as an<br>early detection mechanism that was<br>certainly hoped at the beginning and I<br>think to some extent it's it's true that<br>waste water does provide an early<br>indication of the signal coming through<br>and you can customize it as<br>well so we started looking at um a bunch<br>of sites as far as we could travel in<br>those days was difficult because of the<br>uh covid restrictions um and we were<br>getting we had to get drivers to to move<br>out to these sites it involves<br>collaboration with Welsh water to go to<br>the wastewater treatment works but<br>basically along a road here which is the<br>M4 for those of you who know Wales at<br>all and then there's another major road<br>that goes along the top here so that's<br>that's what with the drivers were doing<br>going up and down this every day<br>collecting samples from these 27 sites<br>and we quickly um managed to expand with<br>Welsh Waters help to about 50 sites or<br>just under 50 sites across the whole of<br>Wales in the middle of whales here there<br>are dragons so it's it's<br>rather it takes you ages to get there<br>and it's well a sheep actually to be<br>honest but um all of these sites were<br>being monitored five days a week and we<br>had the flexibility to so taking samples<br>from um from automated samples we're<br>using what's called composite sampling<br>so the the the sample was taken across<br>the 24-hour cycle you weren't just going<br>and taking a a a spot sample at one<br>particular time um so it's integrated<br>signal over the over the the 24 hours<br>five days a week and weekends when<br>necessary and believe you me it was<br>necessary at sometimes to go at<br>weekends the the the thing that we<br>didn't manage to to push and we would<br>have bit like to have have done was was<br>to be more doing more sample within<br>within the networks within the larger<br>networks in particular and I'll I'll say<br>something about this in a moment but we<br>did develop um approaches for monitoring<br>other sources uh sea ports for example<br>at hollyhead and and fishu guard<br>airports there's only one airport in in<br>Wales which is Cardiff but we're looking<br>at Bristol airport as well and<br>ultimately about nine or 10 hospitals<br>that were dotted around the major um the<br>major um um Health Boards of Wales there<br>are seven Health boards in are and we<br>were breaking this down so this map<br>shows where the sites are and there are<br>14 areas here that are that are colored<br>and those these aren't Health boards<br>they're not political areas they're<br>actually the catchments um for the main<br>rivers in in Wales and it made more<br>sense to in fact Welsh government wanted<br>us to focus on um a geographical<br>attachment rather than link it<br>politically to certain areas of around<br>the country um for good reasons so these<br>are what what to call the L2 drainage<br>areas that are being identified by the<br>the water<br>companies so this infographic really was<br>used to in when we started reporting was<br>developed to indicate what we were doing<br>collecting samples from all around Wales<br>um pulling the samples in in Cardiff and<br>Banger and then um uh carrying out the<br>analysis which initially was qpcr<br>analysis of uh of the sarov 2 virus in<br>the lab here and you can see these These<br>are um um these are the robots that we<br>used for uh for the for the processing<br>of the samples um MSC um microbial<br>safety cabinets uh in which the work was<br>done no people there moment but believe<br>there were people there and then I won't<br>run through the protocol in detail but<br>I'm happy to answer any questions but<br>basically you take your your Wastewater<br>sample coming in um the most efficient<br>way to identify the virus was to<br>precipitate um the RNA with polyethylene<br>glycol that involved leaving it<br>overnight and then spinning it down and<br>that then could go onto an automated RNA<br>extraction DNA and RNA extraction and<br>then rtqpcr to uh to measure the uh the<br>virus signal and retaining the sample as<br>well ultimately once we've develop the<br>uh the um the sequencing<br>procedures so sampling these 47 sites 5<br>days a week and we could process samples<br>collected on the Monday and be reporting<br>the data by Wednesday which was um about<br>50 hours uh from collection to providing<br>the detail for Welsh government and they<br>were using it for policy as well as it<br>turned out we didn't know it for a long<br>time because they didn't feedback but um<br>it's there's well there's a a CO 19<br>inquiry going on in the UK at the moment<br>which will ultimately report in 2026<br>it's really extensive a lot of the<br>publicity that you might have come<br>across from the UK about that has been<br>what's in the whatsapps you know and and<br>uh people slagging off each politicians<br>I should say slagging off each other but<br>there is a serious purpose to this uh um<br>to this inquiry and the ministers in in<br>uh in Wales who were rep who were<br>actually being uh inter being questioned<br>uh last week was saying how important<br>the Wastewater program was for<br>them so we published uh and to some<br>extent we're still publishing although<br>it's been stripped down uh now a<br>situation report across Wales every week<br>through Welsh government we're using<br>normalized data um because of course<br>Wastewater flows vary depending well in<br>the UK and in many countries you've got<br>a combined sewage system so in addition<br>to the Wastewater coming from uh<br>domestic and Industrial sources there's<br>uh rainwater and a lot of it in Wales<br>coming into the system diluting it so<br>you've got to have some way of<br>normalizing for that dilution effect and<br>we were using uh physical chemical Pro<br>proxies such as conductivity well the<br>main ones that we use for conductivity<br>ammonia or the phosphate so that we and<br>we were able and this is this was<br>something the English program couldn't<br>do we were able to get from the Welsh<br>waterer information actually every 15<br>minutes on the flow rates coming into<br>the wastewater treatment works that we<br>were uh that we were monitoring so we<br>had flow data in real time which was<br>which was great and so what we plotted<br>was was an um data a national picture<br>and this is similar to many reports that<br>you see in in different countries um<br>including the New Zealand report where<br>you get a breakdown of what's happening<br>in in each of the areas and a historical<br>um timeline to show what is how the<br>signal today is by comparison with what<br>it was um through a period usually round<br>about to six months or a year and we<br>could break the data down in terms of<br>the areas these 14 L2 catchments um<br>which although<br>they yeah it would certainly it allowed<br>us to identify problems in certain um in<br>certain geographical areas and therefore<br>certain Health boards which was helpful<br>to the health WS in in planning things<br>um particularly in that period through<br>the end of<br>2021 and um and into uh uh into into 19<br>into<br>2021 so I touched on this but just to<br>just to sort of develop and and say<br>something a bit more about the the<br>challenges that we face or that one<br>faces doing this kind of way water<br>treatment works uh uh Wastewater um<br>based epidemiology you've got to be<br>aware that you're looking at wastewater<br>treatment works of very different sizes<br>so I've just picked out two here Cardiff<br>Bay and this is Cardiff this is where um<br>the the university is and the catch the<br>catchment as you can see it's got these<br>fingers these are these are the southw<br>valley South Wales valleys that used to<br>produce loads of coal had um major<br>communities in in The Valleys Ponty PRI<br>is out here this is a massive catchment<br>coming in all funneling in down to one<br>wastewater treatment works down here in<br>Cardiff Bay which is a massive<br>wastewater treatment works but obviously<br>the signal that you're getting there is<br>is is is compromised in in various ways<br>you know how long does it take a signal<br>from out in the uh the reaches of Pont<br>PRI in the in the valleys and and the<br>eale top of the eale um uh catchment how<br>long does it take for the signal to come<br>down to uh to Cardiff what we really<br>wanted to do was to break down and and<br>still want to do and I think we'll be<br>moving forward with this with Welsh<br>water is to be able to get into the<br>catchment and do some sampling within<br>the catchment as well as being able to<br>sample at Waste Water treatment works um<br>kinmel Bay so some ways they covered<br>different geographical areas and you've<br>got you've got a a mobile population in<br>in Cardiff but here you're talking about<br>around about 900,000 people people<br>contributing to this signal so if you've<br>got um I don't know say 50,000 students<br>coming in periodically that's a that's a<br>big change but it's not it's not huge by<br>comparison with some places um kin quinl<br>Bay so this is real up in North Wales<br>Which is popular with with<br>tourists from Liverpool and the and the<br>and the Northeast well you know kin Bay<br>can go from a relatively small<br>population a few thousands to many<br>thousands during tourist season and and<br>a very different sort of how do you<br>account for that so the effects of<br>migration commuting to workplace and<br>tourism are really particularly<br>important I've mentioned dilution of the<br>signal by rainfall that's running off<br>into the uh combined sewer systems we<br>investigated things like transition time<br>temperature and chemicals on the viral<br>stability on on the RNA um degradation<br>the covid c19 sasov 2 degradation and<br>these were important things to do early<br>on and we were trying to do this kind of<br>whilst we were developing a monitoring<br>system to report to Welsh government so<br>and we never really got well established<br>sub the subsampling of these larger<br>catchments particularly Cardiff uh rexam<br>Nash Newport<br>um but we were able to identify how we<br>might do it and in fact we did apply it<br>in one smaller catchment which I'll come<br>on to so this is um just to orientate<br>yourselves this is South Wales it's<br>Cardiff down here Newport here which are<br>the two and Swansea here which are the<br>biggest uh uh cities in in in Wales and<br>this area here is um uh called um Mera<br>tville up at the top Mera tville um is<br>rather steep valley the water treatment<br>works for merville is called kfin and<br>this is a larger map of the area so<br>kilin the water treatment works is down<br>here and then the flows as it were the<br>Wastewater flows from uh merther in the<br>in the top quite a quite a high<br>elevation moving down through Aban and<br>then into into kineth and the colors of<br>these areas represent the rep the level<br>of the relative deprivation of the<br>communities in those uh in that<br>catchment which was an important<br>consideration as well so we were able to<br>set this up and<br>identify with with the Army actually<br>identify where the sampling points were<br>going to be within the catchment and<br>then to uh Implement that I think we had<br>about a week to to get going on this so<br>we got a lot of of help with uh Welsh<br>water as well to get into the into the<br>network and to set up these uh seven<br>sampling points including one sampling<br>point that was collecting waste water<br>from the Prince Charles Hospital which<br>is the biggest in in that area and that<br>allowed us to um get information from<br>the community which wasn't being<br>collected otherwise because members of<br>the community weren't necessarily coming<br>forward to be tested in the<br>um well they eventually they called it<br>Community testing this was towards the<br>end of of<br>2020 but unfortunately you can as you<br>can see from the the BBC News article<br>here it got called at the beginning of<br>the process and there was one or two<br>places I think<br>Liverpool um somewhere in the Midlands<br>somewhere in the Southeast were chosen<br>you know for this uh for this community<br>testing but they were told that they<br>were going to go through Mass testing<br>which you can imagine the how the<br>community might react to being told well<br>we we decided to pick on your community<br>for some Mass testing you know they<br>really it really made them want to<br>volunteer to come along and give a<br>sample not so Wastewater sampling was<br>important in linking what the results<br>that came from the community testing<br>unbiased so I just want to look at one<br>aspect of the of the development work<br>that we did um which was<br>to sequence and and look at variance in<br>the uh in the Wastewater and that was a<br>challenge and I remember that towards<br>the end<br>of oh end of 21 we were told we were<br>going to have to do this with at speed<br>because there was another variant coming<br>in which turned out to be Omicron and<br>you probably are aware that there are<br>various ways in which the sarov 2 virus<br>uh can<br>mutate which are indicated here<br>replication errors or host mediated RNA<br>editing recombination of course it<br>wasn't known to be recombinogenic and it<br>isn't particularly recom enic<br>recombinogenic virus but their<br>recombinant did um did occur and these<br>created variants which we referred to as<br>as uh vamc's or voc's vamc is variance<br>of and mutations of concern or voc's<br>variance of<br>concern um<br>and could that be monitored effectively<br>using PCR approaches well to some extent<br>it could and it was being so remember<br>way back we started the first variant to<br>appear after the Wuhan was Alpha and<br>then beta and then briefly gamma and<br>then Delta and then of course Omicron<br>I'll come on to that all changing the<br>spike protein and the specificity of the<br>spike protein giving concerns about how<br>transmission and infection might be<br>affected by those by those mutations and<br>this uh panel here is just an indication<br>of the huge sequencing effort that was<br>going on across the world this is a Gade<br>uh compilation of data from a whole host<br>of countries and there was a an effort<br>in the UK that was called the Cog UK<br>brought together by Sharon peacock very<br>quickly uh set up to do sequencing of<br>clinical samples and but we were asked<br>Can you know can can waste water tell us<br>anything so we looked at qpcr and and of<br>course you can create uh relatively<br>easily uh assays for the different<br>variants once you know something about<br>them but there were problems with Omron<br>and it it subl linages and things were<br>changing so quickly that you had to be<br>changing the assay almost you know as<br>soon as you got an assay that was tested<br>and and and and in place you were trying<br>to think of a new<br>one and the problem with with the uh PCR<br>approach was that you were looking at uh<br>very often sometimes uh snip artifacts<br>and polymerase area errors false<br>positives in other words that had to be<br>carefully controlled we have published<br>uh relatively recently work that was<br>done by one of the posts on on the<br>project Shin Shang uh who developed what<br>was called a vlock assay based on on<br>Loop mediated amplification lamp rather<br>than PCR and was more um sensitive using<br>a a sort of crisper Cass uh sequence<br>recognition system that was more<br>sensitive but really the push was on to<br>snip assays were useful and the push but<br>but limited and the push was really on<br>to do genomics to provide a gold<br>standard and so we managed to uh to do<br>that many other groups across the world<br>are able to do it with their own uh<br>methodologies as well and we started to<br>implement it towards the end of in in um<br>in in reports going to Welsh government<br>right at the end of 2021 which was good<br>was timely really because there we had<br>Delta throughout and then suddenly over<br>overr everything happened over holidays<br>bank holidays Christmas you know Easter<br>you knew something was going to happen<br>over that time and sure enough over<br>Christmas uh in the UK 2021 to 2022<br>Omron came in and it really started to<br>change quite quickly so you had this<br>period when you had single lineages you<br>know a lineage would sweep through and<br>then it would dominate um the picture as<br>far as the waste water was concerned and<br>that would be reflected also in uh in in<br>the clinical uh sequencing I'll show a<br>comparison in a moment and for a period<br>you know you had uh ba1 Omicron ba1 the<br>World Health Organization sto giving<br>them these um uh these Greek letters and<br>uh switched to just a very confusing<br>lature so I won't go through that but<br>basically the colors tell you when<br>you've got a variant of concern that's<br>coming in ba1 to ba2 and then three four<br>and then there was a period in in end of<br>2022 into<br>2023 particularly around here and this<br>we had<br>problems we had problems around about uh<br>early which was that's gives me the<br>sweats thinking about that but we got<br>back on again but this was what was<br>called um by the um a number of<br>investigating teams Omicron soup so you<br>had so many variants in there it was<br>just you know how did they coexist in in<br>the community and what was what were the<br>what was which variant was going to win<br>out next and and it always seemed to be<br>uh uh it always seemed to be quite<br>diverse so we were happy with that and<br>we were using a package uh and many<br>other groups do as well which was<br>developed at scripts in California<br>called Freya to take what is I mean bear<br>in mind you're looking at small<br>fragments of RNA in Wastewater that's<br>being uh sequenced so made copied into<br>RT uh reverse transcript into DNA and<br>then short reads that are then been<br>compiled to produce a it's it's a sort<br>of slated mechanism uh to produce the<br>the viral identification and I always<br>the question in my mind because we we<br>weren't able to get hold of the clinical<br>data because of uh the the limitations<br>on the and there were some ethical<br>issues as well um to compare it with the<br>the the genomic data that was coming out<br>of of<br>cob but we did eventually and I'll show<br>you the comparison so we did some a lot<br>of stats on these data to try and work<br>out what how how we could model um this<br>this process of of these um sweeps of<br>mutations that were coming through and<br>and reflected in in the Wastewater and<br>this is just one uh early um modeling<br>that uh that came out of work that um<br>one of the postdocs Will Perry did where<br>you could identify two um using uh<br>multi-dimensional um scaling you could<br>identify two clusters which are<br>imaginatively named imaginatively named<br>one and two here um so one is the<br>circles and and and two is are the<br>triangles and the colors here they from<br>indicate the point at which uh those<br>variant those clusters are are evident<br>in in the data so this is kind of a<br>statistic uh to represent the data and<br>uh<br>the what it pointed towards was that we<br>had evidence statistical evidence from<br>the Wastewater of a change from this as<br>it were orderly succession of variants<br>uh through to about um October September<br>October uh<br>20122 to a more chaotic Omicron soup<br>situation which was represented by<br>cluster 2 so cluster one represents an<br>orderly um uh succession of um of viral<br>genome<br>and cluster two represents the more um<br>the more<br>um the more random as it or the the the<br>variants when we were able to get hold<br>of the um the clinical data from uh from<br>Cod UK specifically for Wales and you<br>put it against the Wastewater data it<br>doesn't match exactly but you can just<br>see from from the colors that there is a<br>a pretty good uh um link between the two<br>and and we analyzing these data at the<br>moment now in fact we've got we're just<br>about toh to submit a paper to indicate<br>the extent to which for the different<br>variants whether we were seeing them in<br>the Wastewater before we they were being<br>seen clinically or at the same time or<br>in some cases afterwards and it's it's<br>it's mutation dependent so there's not<br>one answer even for sasov 2 and the<br>situation now at the moment just so this<br>is bang up to date this is uh um from U<br>from<br>March that uh in the UK it's all gone<br>back to one single variant called<br>j.1 and it's the same in New Zealand<br>everything and in the US everything has<br>settled down and unless something<br>emerges that's where going to be but the<br>the value of Wastewater is indicated I<br>think here these are this is from the so<br>this is the clinical data as it were the<br>Cog uh data<br>and these this is a l a log scale of the<br>number of tests that are being carried<br>out over time and the red line that or<br>the dotted red line that I put in there<br>in indicates 100 tests across Wales so<br>bearing in mind it's log scale you know<br>in the early parts of um<br>2022 thousands or even hundreds of<br>thousands of tests were being done a<br>week and that was maintained you know<br>around about the thousands hundreds to<br>to thousands through most of the period<br>into<br>2023 but now it's kind of dropped off a<br>cliff and we you know some weeks only<br>getting 10 samples for all clinical<br>testing a week so waste water provides a<br>a sort of reassurance to government<br>anyway as to what is happening across<br>the whole of the country and this<br>statistic again a multi-dimensional<br>scaling statistic just shows you how the<br>patterns of the Wastewater data set um<br>even when it's not normalized for<br>population and then the population uh<br>normalized data set here and the Cog<br>data set which is the uh the variant<br>sequencing from patients and individuals<br>in public health surveys how they they<br>follow each<br>other and I think that's that's really<br>um pleasing from from our point of view<br>and uh and and you know helps to provide<br>uh some evidence to to suggest that<br>Wastewater uh is providing use<br>information has provided useful<br>information I'll move through this quite<br>quickly but I think it's going to be<br>important for the future development<br>what we want to do as well is to be able<br>to use waste water as it were to say<br>when a new variant is coming in you know<br>what can we do that without<br>having um as it were prior and and can<br>the signal be interpreted so um our this<br>this was a multi disciplinary project<br>and and on the uh on the informatics<br>side on the math side um Owen uh Jones<br>and um and Arthur Morris are working on<br>a synthetic data or have worked on a<br>synthetic data set which has been<br>generated to look like the uh the phases<br>that we were seeing in the real data so<br>a phase one where you're getting a flux<br>these stable lineages uh taking over<br>phase two where you got Omicron soup and<br>phase three now where it's gone back to<br>how it was in in phase in Phase One<br>transition back to single dominant<br>dominant lineage States um and Arthur<br>has taken this with a tool called Art um<br>to generate a um a model for the genetic<br>drift um or the genetic changes that are<br>happening um in that data set in that<br>synthetic data set based on real<br>clinical data and you can see uh it's<br>represented here in this<br>three-dimensional space although he's<br>working with uh many more Dimensions<br>than three but I think it it simplifies<br>things and I'll try and walk you through<br>this diagram in particular so we've got<br>what we've seeing here is the is the<br>state as it were the mutational state of<br>the uh of the Wastewater with time so<br>the colors represent time here on a time<br>scale from zero to 100 days arbitrarily<br>in the in in this model um<br>and the three phases that I mentioned<br>earlier are represented here and they're<br>also represented along this vertical<br>time scale and the three dimensions here<br>show you what's happening in terms of<br>the mutational state of the of the<br>metagenomic sample that's been taken and<br>you can you can trace a path through<br>these three dimensions uh from the the<br>purple through the the green yellow<br>through to the yellow the end point is<br>after 100 days what's that tell you well<br>what you've got is cluster formation in<br>certain places here for example here<br>around the the Omicron soup very briefly<br>and then here and those are points of<br>stabilization and when you got movement<br>away from those stable clusters you've<br>got a new mutation coming in or an<br>emerging mutation an emerging lineage um<br>so drifts as it were from the Clusters<br>in this uh analysis to um<br>uh and an emergence of new mutations are<br>are indicated or are identified in this<br>in this sort of way and this statistic<br>can now be is now being used to create a<br>basin model to predict when you've got a<br>change so if if we're starting at day<br>100<br>now and there was a change away from<br>that is that can we see that as a new<br>mutation and are there no without having<br>any prior information as to the<br>mutations the type of mutation that's<br>that's happening as as was the case with<br>the<br>pru we doing for<br>time okay so I shall uh wrap up<br>reasonably quickly now we're using this<br>for um uh Wastewater analysis for for<br>looking at antimicrobial resistance as<br>well which I'm particularly pleased<br>about because that I think is as much if<br>not more of a threat than potential<br>future pandemics and so the 47 sites and<br>nine hospitals the the sh the the<br>shading of the areas here now represents<br>the Seven health boards uh across Wales<br>so we're um we're evaluating the<br>abundance and diversity of antimicrobial<br>resistance genes with huge metagenomic<br>sequencing of samples across um across<br>Wales over about a period of a year now<br>we' collected samples and trying to look<br>at the stability and or or or otherwise<br>of these of these signals in time and<br>and space we've used two approaches<br>actually to look at uh antimicrobial<br>resistance Gene markers metagenomics<br>which I think is is probably more<br>valuable but high throughput qpcr as<br>well where we looked at 20<br>175 U markers 175 primer sets and cre we<br>got a<br>huge huge bu Bank of waste samples so if<br>anyone wants samples just write and let<br>me know<br>need we need to monetize this this<br>stuff and we're trying to<br>map antimicrobial resistance genes<br>across Wales bear in mind this is in in<br>the Wastewater itself the Wastewater<br>signal and the hospital signals which<br>represent communities so the good thing<br>about this sort of data is that you<br>don't face the ethical problems that you<br>might face if you were going to sample<br>individuals or clinical use clinical<br>data<br>it's also got environmental um impact<br>because because of the the the combined<br>sewer uh system we have combined sewer<br>overflows so when there is storms and<br>when the sewage system can't cope it's<br>uh goes out into the rivers through<br>outfalls or it goes out into estri<br>through wears and so there is a lot of<br>um political public concern about this<br>and has been since since covid I don't<br>know whether the same is you probably<br>got better controls in in New Zealand<br>than than we have but it's it's really a<br>live issue in the states in in in the uh<br>in in Wales and in the UK this map here<br>from the river trust all of these um<br>suitably uh Brown blobs are where there<br>is uh C A CSO going into your River so<br>when you swim you to some extent you<br>might be swimming in diluted poo I'm<br>exaggerating of<br>course and so we've used the<br>samples um both well with sampling<br>Rivers now and the and the Wastewater<br>samples I won't run through this this is<br>the workflow for the AMR analysis and<br>we've developed pipelines uh based on a<br>program called AMR<br>Plus+ uh for to identify the the<br>antimicrobial resistance Gene markers<br>and also uh the microbiome or the<br>microbial communities using Kraken and<br>Bracken databases so we've got two<br>outputs two data stream outputs the<br>resistome really and the microbiome and<br>a lot of effort is needs to go into<br>analyzing that it's a huge huge data<br>set and it impacts on one Health so you<br>know<br>traditionally<br>our until the last 10 years I suppose we<br>focused public health is focused on on<br>the human uh experience and and and<br>human communities but it's much better<br>recognize now that if you just focus<br>here then you're only seeing a partial<br>picture because of course there is<br>evolution of microbes um uh in the<br>environment in the um in the uh in other<br>in animals and uh whether they're wild<br>animals or or livestock that is going to<br>have an impact on human health and vice<br>versa and so unless you're considering<br>all of these compartments you're not<br>really not um going to get a full<br>picture as to what's uh what is<br>happening for example with antimicrobial<br>resistance and well this uh graphic<br>which is taken from L and Flack review<br>relatively recently just illustrates the<br>fact for most<br>antibiotics um uh you're in pollu<br>environments you're looking at<br>concentrations of actual antibiotics in<br>those environments in Industrial Waste<br>in untreated Hospital effluent and to<br>some extent in untreated Municipal<br>sewage you're looking at concentrations<br>of antibiotics that are actually present<br>in those samples which are at or above<br>the typical minimum inhibitory<br>concentrations those antibiotics for uh<br>the organisms that they're meant to uh<br>they're meant to kill in and use for for<br>treatment and rivers and and and seas<br>although they're below those mic's<br>they're nevertheless selecting for<br>antimicrobial resistance in the in the<br>in the natural environment in the uh<br>engineered<br>environment um one of the data that<br>we'll be publishing shortly has been<br>submitted for publication this is just<br>one figure from um uh from um rma's uh<br>paper but looks at antimicrobial<br>resistance marker abundance<br>and antimicrobial resistance marker<br>diversity in hospital um Hospital<br>samples and then the Wastewater uh<br>inflow or Inlet associated with the<br>hospital and then the Wastewater Outlet<br>which is going into a river um and<br>although abundance and this is um a<br>linear scale although abundance and the<br>diversity represented by the Shannon<br>index are reduced as a result of going<br>through the wastewater treatment works<br>and at the outlet you're still getting<br>substantial um abund substantial markers<br>antimicrobial resistance markers you're<br>still getting AMR going out into the<br>rivers um uh um which will uh have an<br>impact so<br>um this just sort of I just yeah so this<br>is um the political side as you don't<br>really want it and um there's an<br>election going on in in Wales but before<br>that last year um the health Minister<br>Ellen Morgan who was really very<br>supportive uh and very helpful um in May<br>2023 opened up the new lab in Bango or<br>it a refurbish lab there's a lot of<br>fanfare associated with that and then a<br>few weeks later there was a financial<br>crisis in in the UK because uh the um<br>Chancellor decided that the government's<br>going to pay the public sector um uh pay<br>award 6% and that money had to be found<br>within the year and while government was<br>turning into crisis and so on the 31st<br>of July which isn't that long after may<br>we were told we had to shut down<br>completely you know we were given a<br>month to close the project and then uh<br>which and Ellen Morgan was really upset<br>about this but felt that there was no<br>choice and then a new variant seemed to<br>be coming in was coming in in fact into<br>and and there in in in in the UK new<br>covid variant New sasov 2 uh variant and<br>she agreed<br>under um she pressurized her colleague<br>cabinets I think to agree that there<br>should be uh resumption of Wastewater<br>monitoring in Wells but um what was<br>called at a lower at a lower scale so we<br>had to devise a plan to do to shift from<br>50 sites to something like 11 sites but<br>the data that we had was excellent uh in<br>in in identifying what the what which<br>were the sites to concentrate<br>on and then just last week um Ellen<br>Morgan was giving evidence at the covid<br>inquiry and as I said earlier she was<br>saying how important that program has<br>been in uh in assisting in in the<br>um policy decisions that were being made<br>by by well<br>government but we're running until the<br>end of March we don't know what's<br>happening end of next week um it will go<br>through another<br>Hiatus I think it's been the the first<br>Minister uh for Wales uh has been pretty<br>well elected now so it's likely to be um<br>it's likely to be somebody who has a<br>science background and that's great for<br>us but we honestly don't know where<br>we're going to be going with uh with<br>with in terms of the program as far as<br>Welsh government is concerned beyond the<br>end of this<br>month and I think it's fair to say that<br>this has been successful but the science<br>and methodology really from here needs<br>more development needs to become more<br>robust we got we were getting well we<br>got within the last six months we got to<br>a place where we had trust and and and<br>cooperation between uh ourselves and<br>public health well a real partnership<br>and that it's a shame that we're going<br>we're going to have to work hard to try<br>and build on that in the absence of<br>Welsh Government funding at least for a<br>few months but I think that's that's in<br>a in a good place now whereas it wasn't<br>a year ago but we still need to secure<br>funding to make this what I think is it<br>needs to be a a um a a program uh that<br>is is embedded and is is is fit for the<br>future and has um security uh to allow<br>it to operate in a in a um for pandemic<br>preparedness so we're working closely<br>with uh the other um Nations across the<br>for across the UK the England Scotland<br>and and Northern Ireland to try and<br>develop standardized approaches um for<br>the for the future from the ukri has<br>gone in for that it'll only provide a<br>small amount and also some of one of the<br>the the great things to come out of this<br>is a a center of doctoral training which<br>um is involves Cardiff Banger bath<br>University ex University the center for<br>Ecology and hydrology and I mention it<br>here because um it's also uh attract we<br>can we can take on students from<br>overseas and so if anyone has an<br>interest in this or you know anyone who<br>might have an interest in this sort of<br>research um please pass the information<br>along and I'll just finish with cast<br>of thousands and maybe I should point<br>out you know the colleagues Isabel Don<br>Pete ke Owen<br>Jones um and Tom Connor in public health<br>Wells particularly important well Tom is<br>is Jo I got a joint appointment with<br>card is particularly important and Davey<br>of course Davey's team K and<br>um Rachel Williams been hugely uh just<br>just brilliant post dos Will Perry Amy<br>Baldwin um Arthur in particular and and<br>Alvaro on the sequencing side developing<br>the sequencing the drivers uh yeah<br>unsung heroes and then all of these um<br>alumni and Gareth uh Gareth Prost and<br>Steve Coby in Welsh<br>government Tony Harington INRI in in in<br>Welsh waterer really you know brought a<br>team together in a team spirit and it's<br>been uh it's been a fantastic<br>experience sorry I've gone on for far<br>too long<br>questions you alluded to the fact that<br>when you looked at the Westing along the<br>clinical data that there were times when<br>the waste water testing preceded the<br>prediction of different bars but there<br>was other times when it lagged yes do<br>you know why that no no I mean would<br>have to but it's the the it that's a<br>statistic really that and it it's it's<br>only very slight so I'm<br>thinking you know it's not by any much<br>more than a week or two either way and<br>most times it's it's pretty well they<br>were being reported at the same time<br>bearing in mind as well that for the for<br>both data sets you're looking at data<br>that's collected over a period of a week<br>and then it's it's comp but whether<br>there's a<br>biological um<br>explanation I think I'd look for<br>something in the in the way in which the<br>you know the data are being uh being<br>processed rather than biological<br>explanation and it's disappointing<br>because I think there was a lot of hope<br>that Wastewater testing would give you<br>that edge and it would do if you have if<br>you have no I mean bearing in<br>mind the the huge amount of testing that<br>was going on for a lot of the period of<br>the pandemic if you imagine that wasn't<br>happening of course yeah and and and if<br>we can if this tool that Arthur and and<br>and Owen<br>developed um could be applied to you<br>know metagenic OMC analysis of some<br>other pathogens some other virus you<br>know if you're looking at flu or<br>something like that I think that could<br>be really powerful and important<br>yeah Josh um so I noticed that you so<br>you had the three<br>phases um is it likely or is it is it<br>likely for a phase two like thing to<br>become sort of<br>cyclical U so go through a phase one<br>where it's where it's the succession and<br>then a phase two where there's oh I<br>don't I don't think yeah it could it<br>could even now I don't think we bearing<br>in mind okay I don't know we don't know<br>the answer to that I don't know the<br>answer to that that's for sure whether<br>that could happen I think possibly it<br>could what Arthur is doing at the moment<br>is just focusing on mutations in in the<br>spike protein which have Ro is really<br>the the forar c 2 anyway is the<br>important the mutations in that seem to<br>be the most important in terms of its<br>transmission and and um its infectivity<br>and and whether it was competitive and<br>and took off in the population so it<br>might he might be able to you know to<br>model different<br>outcomes but what we all we're looking<br>at is what we saw actually in the<br>pandemic and looking at it otherwise is<br>any you know and the you know could<br>question is is how stable is it now is<br>is a mutation going to come with jm1 I<br>think the sorts of mutations that really<br>make a difference and there's there are<br>some variants in the Wastewater signal<br>which point towards this are the<br>recombinants and that change that can<br>change things really uh really quite<br>quickly but sasov 2 isn't so Comin it's<br>not like flu for example it's not so<br>recombinogenic<br>interest using this to um aex<br>development yeah yeah well not not not<br>the yeah yeah and and there's group<br>working on that about many groups<br>working yeah but I can't tell you know<br>it's not my my area so not really tell<br>much about that at all<br>unfortunately<br>think</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
