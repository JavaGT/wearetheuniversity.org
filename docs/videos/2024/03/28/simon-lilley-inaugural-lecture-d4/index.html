accurate.</p><p>as as Abigail said um what I want to<br>look at is the way in<br>which we do stuff with stuff that's<br>what's animated me throughout my career<br>I'm interested in the ways in which we<br>use Technologies in the broadest<br>possible sense to enable us to do things<br>and to enable us to do things at scale<br>and scope to do things we can't<br>otherwise orchestrate bring together<br>sustain without those Technologies and I<br>want to look particularly at the role of<br>representation in those sorts of<br>Technologies I want to think a little<br>bit about the ways in<br>which working in that<br>Way Comes not only with uh significant<br>benefits but also with a series of<br>associated costs and I want to think<br>particularly about referencing some more<br>recent work I've been engaged in how<br>that understanding of the world might be<br>helpful to us as we move into what is<br>increasingly likely to be recognized as<br>the anthropos scene I'm working with<br>some of the geologists who are involved<br>in trying to get that recognition of the<br>fact that our our our new era the era we<br>have been<br>probably the best guess I guess is<br>probably mid-40s is when you'd start it<br>that we are now so significant an<br>influence on the world system and the<br>Earth system the ways in which the<br>planet sustains itself<br>persists that uh we have to think about<br>factoring that into how we think of the<br>eras of the of the Earth's life and then<br>finally as Abigail said you got to give<br>a soop throw some meat to the audience<br>I'll have a little reflection on<br>academic freedom at the end so that's<br>goes so little bit about me well that's<br>a bit of a rhetorical flourish isn't it<br>really because it's all about me today<br>but<br>uh I am for my sins a lapsed<br>psychologist I think people who study<br>psychology end up doing one of two<br>things with it either they make a<br>fruitful and marvelous career or they<br>run away screaming um I'm in the L Camp<br>um I I signed up to do a psychology<br>degree naively thinking I get to think<br>about dream and what they meant and<br>instead I got to train a rat to press a<br>lever many times before it got a pellet<br>um so my flight from Psychology was<br>enabled by uh a PhD at Edinburgh under<br>the aaces of what then was a flood of<br>money from the uh economic and social<br>research Council to find fund five major<br>centers in the UK in its program on<br>information and communication<br>Technologies and this dates me a bit the<br>kind of intent behind find that program<br>the<br>unwritten um sense of the urgency of of<br>why that work was necessary was it was<br>apparently going to enable us to<br>LeapFrog the Japanese in information<br>technologies that was the the the<br>nerking thought and the inelegant<br>um title I ended up with for my PhD was<br>discourse and socio technical<br>transformation the emergence of Refinery<br>Information Systems as a page<br>Turner dad actually read<br>it bizarre um and a lot of this work<br>came together in a book from I think<br>that's now 20 years old representing<br>organization with a couple of colleagues<br>uh but a lot of my PhD was in that along<br>with other bits and<br>buls<br>so the PHD in Practical terms involved<br>me hanging about an oil refinery for<br>about 2 years I don't recommend it<br>they're smelly things um and everything<br>you're told in the safety training for<br>the site is honored in the breach on a<br>minute by- minute basis um but<br>essentially what I did was I wanded<br>about mainly in the administrative<br>blocks talking to people about what they<br>thought they were up to they were in the<br>process of attempting to integrate the<br>different systems through which they<br>modeled different parts of the refinery<br>into some overall model of how the<br>refinery would work and that's because<br>they felt that they were were<br>increasingly being managed by the plant<br>rather than managing the plant and they<br>wanted to get some more control of it<br>now for those of you don't know crude<br>oil refining is a relatively simple<br>matter in basic terms it's much more<br>complex in uh in more sophisticated<br>terms but in basic terms what you do<br>with crude oil is you separate it into<br>different<br>bits different lengths of hydrocarbons<br>essentially now what you end up with is<br>a mix of those things some of which are<br>consider more valuable than others and<br>other processes at refineries try and<br>break down the bits that aren't that<br>valuable into being the bits that are<br>more<br>valuable now the sorts of things that<br>fascinated me and continue to fascinate<br>me around<br>that are things that are kind of<br>signaled by one aspect of the system I<br>was looking at a thing called the mass<br>balance reconciliation<br>system now the mass balance conciliation<br>system would try to work<br>out when some product had left point a<br>and supposedly went to point B but<br>didn't register on meter C in<br>between what was wrong had the stuff not<br>moved had the sensor not worked had the<br>receiving tank not captured the fact<br>that the thing had<br>arrived and I've given you a more<br>parochial example down the bottom there<br>that's my bloody dashboard on my car<br>which protect per actually has that<br>symbol flashing at me and every time I<br>take it to a mechanic he oh there's<br>something wrong with the computer system<br>or the lights mate you don't want to<br>worry about that so I carry on driving<br>it one day of course my car's going to<br>explode while I'm on the<br>motorway and the police will arrive say<br>didn't you pay any attention to that<br>flashing yellow<br>sign but it's a perennial problem what<br>do if a sign tells us<br>something how do we know that the sign<br>is right and if it's not right it's is<br>it something to do with the sign or is<br>it something to do with the underlying<br>system that the sign is trying to inform<br>us about after my PhD I had the pleasure<br>of working as a a researcher on a couple<br>of funding projects with um the<br>delightful mmud smml and Hugh Wilmont at<br>what was then umist projects funded by<br>um The Institute of Chon accountant<br>Springland and Wales and the Char<br>Institute of Management accountants and<br>they were basically projects trying to<br>look at how management had changed in<br>the flour of activity that came along<br>with the kind of neoliberal<br>reorganization of the economy that took<br>place in the<br>1980s so this was things like delayering<br>just in time Total Quality Management<br>endless fascination with culture change<br>organizations wanted to change their<br>cultures right left and Center so the<br>the example I've picked up here in a<br>paper from accounting organizations and<br>Society was some work we did looking at<br>in in in some detail at changes going on<br>in an aircraft<br>manufacturer now the Zeal of the changes<br>is kind of indicated by a number of<br>things around this some of the people we<br>interviewed described themselves as<br>Evangelical management<br>accountants strange breed and not a<br>Creed I'd sign up to myself but they<br>were interesting people the most<br>interesting guy in this in in our study<br>was a a chap who' done an MBA and<br>obviously worked in the car industry<br>before coming to work in aircraft<br>manufacturer and he was endlessly<br>frustrated with the engineers he found<br>there who saw themselves as some sort of<br>Artisans he didn't like that at all yeah<br>the factory cleared painted most of it<br>blue and then put gray lines on it where<br>the work was meant to flow he described<br>it as building a Motorway to the Future<br>and he wanted these people these<br>previous Artisans to see their their<br>work in making planes as a bit like<br>shelling<br>peas yeah wasn't having any of this<br>and they also started running very very<br>sophisticated uh just in time<br>systems and the quote there they're on<br>the dust test really stuck with me at<br>the time I was interviewing this guy he<br>looked out the window and there's a huge<br>nose cone about to be assembled onto<br>this plane and he said those things<br>those things out there they're on the<br>dust<br>test so in the process of this<br>transformation something that a year<br>before would have just seen been seen as<br>an inconvenience or a reason to sack the<br>cleaners for not doing the job well<br>enough has suddenly become the most<br>important economic indicator as far as<br>this manager is concerned if a nose cone<br>that costs a million pounds has been<br>sitting there long enough to gather dust<br>you have wasted a considerable amount of<br>capital funding its presence and you<br>didn't need to do that one of the other<br>things I particularly liked about his<br>work and reordering Factory was that<br>every now and then when he was bringing<br>dignitaries down from head office he'd<br>be walking them around and the the<br>rather more waggish members of the<br>remaining staff still somewhat smarting<br>at their lack of artisanal um status in<br>the putative future where they would put<br>ducks on the blueit rubber ducks on the<br>blue bits of the of the floor and then<br>they would hide themselves between<br>behind various Dividing Walls around the<br>place and as the dignitaries were going<br>past they make duck<br>humor more recently a similar thing<br>trying to understand how people make<br>sense of the objects that they work with<br>and through so this is a study with some<br>colleagues uh in a specialist Hospital<br>looking at the ways in which the<br>hospital's rearrangement reorganization<br>to cope with the covid pandemic became<br>freighted with huge amounts of symbolic<br>significance but also moral<br>significance so they'd always been talk<br>about a central Corridor in the in in<br>the hospital and what it meant and what<br>it did but the process of shifting a<br>load of people to working from home and<br>another bunch of people from working on<br>the premises produced a divide and a<br>different what and it enabled people to<br>kind of see the corridor<br>differently uh and I heard today<br>actually that our follow-up paper to<br>this one with in the same Journal<br>focusing much more specifically on the<br>corridor and from where this picture<br>comes got accepted today so that's<br>nice so in all three cases I'm intrigued<br>by the meaning of things and how people<br>work with things and I'm interested in<br>the way in which the meaning of things<br>shifts and how those things act as<br>conduits to other worlds how those<br>things<br>augment the here and now with the there<br>and then either from the past or in the<br>future images are treacherous things<br>though as indeed a words and the<br>relationship between words and images is<br>treacherous<br>enough when you actually throw in the<br>matters of the world as well the<br>treachery abounds and<br>multiplies and just like that indicator<br>on the car dashboard you never quite<br>know which one of them is being<br>unfaithful when a story isn't traveling<br>properly the meaning isn't traveling as<br>we'd expect so this is the bit if I were<br>selling uh shampoo in the 1980s where<br>bit I was fortunate enough to work in<br>his later life with Bob Cooper and he<br>also examined my<br>PhD and I<br>suspect probably I can say this without<br>exception nobody's work influenced me as<br>much as Bob's<br>did he was an iconoclastic thinker an<br>absolutely appalling work colleague lots<br>of the time um but absolutely brilliant<br>phenomenally<br>brilliant hardly ever managed to publish<br>anything in any sensible places because<br>nobody wanted it was almost impossible<br>to work with because if you tried to<br>change a word he would lose it<br>completely because he spent so much care<br>over each word but a genius real insight<br>into the world so these uh quotes here<br>are all taken from a piece uh he<br>published in an edited collection in<br>1993<br>um and they try to get to the heart of<br>this this issue that I'm I'm grappling<br>with how do we work with Technologies<br>what's the relationship between<br>technology and representation how do we<br>use Technologies to bring stuff that<br>isn't with us now into our purview into<br>our calculations into our thinking into<br>our<br>planning according to Bob and I think<br>he's right technology and representation<br>are immemorially connected there's<br>always been a relationship between<br>representation and for<br>Bob the key insight there is that the<br>representation is our response to our<br>body's inadequacy in the<br>world our body's fragility in the world<br>our<br>body's limits in the world be they<br>cognitive or<br>physical or conceptual<br>even all representations originate in<br>the instability of the body body or Tech<br>the ancient Greek term for technology of<br>this sort or making flows from this need<br>of the body to represent itself in terms<br>structures and that entails a couple of<br>moves<br>first of all you have to kind of look at<br>the body and work out where it's holding<br>you<br>back and then capture that some way but<br>capture it in a way that turns a deficit<br>into a benefit that turns a cost into an<br>opportunity and<br>then you augment the body with that<br>which you've taken from it and brought<br>back to it I'm going to need to unpack<br>this a little little bit I think in a<br>couple of the next<br>slides and<br>then that immemorial process under goes<br>a qualitative change with the Inception<br>of modern technology and modern<br>Technologies of<br>scale instead of the more ancient<br>concern with just making something<br>present for apprehension or use as<br>chance might allow so I guess the most<br>obvious example would be a sale yeah it<br>only it only does the work you want it<br>to do when there's wind in wind in the<br>right<br>direction compared to say an outboard<br>motor modern technology puts the stress<br>on immediacy of use constant<br>availability and easing of effort it<br>turns the world into a standing reserve<br>for human use and that's great it gives<br>us all sorts of<br>benefits but it comes with<br>costs it comes with costs particularly<br>when that world view when that way of<br>seeing how we are and how we can be in<br>the world takes precedence over all<br>others and crowds out the space for<br>other ways of capturing the world and<br>thinking about it like the ways of art<br>for<br>example now my two key sources apart<br>from Bob and I'm sure I came to these<br>sources through Bob in working this<br>stuff through were uh both literary<br>theorists so Sam vber there in the top<br>what's it what's it to you top right<br>hand corner mass media auras fantastic<br>series of essays the one that<br>particularly took me is one<br>about television the essay is called<br>television set and screen and he looks<br>at the way in which television in a<br>number of different European<br>countries uh the ways in<br>which television is both a surface on<br>which we can see distant aspects of the<br>world it sets before us things that<br>aren't here in the here and<br>now but it screens the fact that it's<br>doing that it hides it and we look<br>through the television as if we have a<br>natural purview on the world but of<br>course we don't we're looking at a world<br>radically altered and changed and<br>denatured in many ways by the presence<br>of the technologies that enable<br>and<br>entertainingly he then draws out the<br>things that seem to attract most<br>attention and be aware of the fact that<br>this is obviously pre on demand<br>television so<br>um what what really captures our<br>attention on television and he claims<br>this is the case in all three of the<br>kind of different terrains in which he<br>looks it's things like<br>sport now why is it things like sport<br>well V's answer is because actually the<br>technology of television in bringing<br>everything closer together making us<br>able to see things from afar has altered<br>the world radically and destabilized it<br>and thus the thing that we like to use<br>the technology for most is a comfort<br>blanket we watch things that deliver<br>certainty because we're living in a<br>world that's now more uncertain more<br>confused more difficult to navigate<br>because of the technology that we<br>deployed within it and we mify ourselves<br>by watching people chase a bladder<br>around to an outcome that is agreed and<br>unchallengeable<br>here Elaine scary Harvard literary<br>theorist that book is is a hell of a<br>read I recommend it if you've got a<br>strong stomach but effectively what<br>scary did in that work is look at a<br>series of reports from y International<br>on<br>torture and one of the things she<br>finds tragically I guess is that our<br>kind of Hollywood versions of torture in<br>which there are elaborate torture<br>implements doesn't actually marry up<br>much with the realities of the world<br>torture is generally inflicted almost<br>always inflicted with everyday objects<br>really everyday objects everyday objects<br>that become menacing in the way in which<br>they are are taken out of their normal<br>domesticized use and instead used to<br>inflict<br>pain and what she draws from that is<br>that the process of that torturing is a<br>dehumanization it's a way of reducing<br>the subject narrowing their world to as<br>small a point as possible until they<br>crack and will tell you anything which<br>is of course why Tor torture is an<br>absolutely useless mode of Engagement<br>with an enemy because its consequences<br>are that you get unreliable information<br>from people because they'll tell you<br>anything to make it<br>stop but what she does by effectively<br>she reverses that say like if that's how<br>worlds are<br>reduced then the converse is how worlds<br>are made augmented extended that's how<br>we increase our reach that's how we are<br>in the world and extend ourselves into<br>the world other sources that in<br>influence me around about the same time<br>so there that tracing the semiotic<br>boundaries of politics is where Bob's<br>piece that I was talking about earlier<br>appeared um I'm going to come on to the<br>formal organization of representation<br>piece in a moment but Bob was drawing<br>upon and lots of people were being very<br>influenced by this again another Harvard<br>uh academic shashana zubov probably more<br>famous now for her more recent work on<br>surveillance capitalism but at the time<br>she was looking at again similar<br>processes to the one I was looking at<br>the ways in which information<br>Technologies were not only being used to<br>automate existing uh manufacturing<br>processes but were in the process<br>informating them they were necessarily<br>generating an informational excess as<br>part and parcel of the way in which the<br>um automation was going on and if you<br>want an explanation as good as any for<br>why we have so many managers in the<br>world it's<br>that information begets management<br>management begets<br>information without information you<br>can't manage and the proliferation of<br>management I've got a FEA up there the<br>Open Access Journal because to my<br>delight I am about to uh publish a<br>co-edited uh issue of that with a couple<br>of colleagues from uh Bristol and<br>Copenhagen business school where we have<br>gone back and looked at some the more<br>weird and wonderful output of Bob's work<br>that never ever got published anywhere<br>or if it did get published you can never<br>find it now these things circulate as<br>MOS or photocopies amongst the faithful<br>and have done for years but we thought<br>that we should probably take this out to<br>the world so we we we we we've re we've<br>published six of these pieces but also<br>invited commentary upon them by a number<br>of um exist current Scholars to look at<br>how they might might be useful for<br>Bob's most elegant paper I think is<br>probably now only findable in this book<br>an edit a collected um Gathering of his<br>work put together after he<br>died and the title of the piece is<br>formal organization as<br>representation and the subtitle<br>argument so Bob's contention is that in<br>organizations are increasingly<br>processors of information if they were<br>ever anything else but an increasing and<br>more more prominent function that they<br>engage in is processing information but<br>that arrives in the second act before<br>you can process information you need a<br>representation and that representation<br>can either be diminished or strengthened<br>augmented or weakened by the information<br>that comes to it but the information<br>cannot register cannot do anything<br>without an existing<br>representation now what does Modern<br>representation this kind of grand scale<br>representation<br>entail well for Bob it's about remote<br>control yeah it's about building centers<br>of calculation in which stuff is<br>gathered and then people pour over<br>it and decide what to do it's about<br>expand ing power expanding<br>influence now how do you gather things<br>together to do that with them well first<br>of all you got to make them as small as<br>possible because they've got to travel<br>and then you've got to move them yeah so<br>representation involves remote control<br>enabled by abbreviation of the world so<br>that the world those aspects of the<br>world can be displaced can be moved can<br>be gathered together and treated as one<br>dealt with on the same tabletop there's<br>a nice pre-digital example I don't know<br>how many of you came across this at the<br>time I only heard about it actually a<br>couple of weeks<br>ago uh a number of the uh successful<br>escapes from German prisoner of war<br>camps were apparently enabled by a fake<br>charity working for the British State<br>sending out copies of<br>Monopoly nice thing to keep the keep the<br>lads distracted stop them building<br>tunnels<br>um but within those Char charitably<br>distributed copies of the innocent game<br>were silk Maps folded up as small as<br>possible so that they would fit inside<br>the pieces of a Monopoly board that's<br>how a number of the escapes knew where<br>they were escaping to cuz somebody had<br>already been there made a map produced<br>it reduced it displaced it and delivered<br>it to them that's how they knew where<br>they were going now quite why I pick the<br>pick the picture from the film with the<br>uh the two saddest characters who who<br>get the grimmest demise is still Beyond<br>me but uh there's the Great Escape and<br>of course once you<br>digitize once your information is being<br>carried once your representations are<br>being carried by<br>bits that process radically accelerates<br>and radically<br>hyperbolized so that's the other<br>problem and vas or Sam V has already<br>hinted at it where we saw earlier when<br>you pull stuff together in this way you<br>make the interactions between it much<br>more rapid much more thoroughgoing and<br>much more<br>unpredictable so chap paro's book from<br>the early 80s normal accidents<br>effectively looks at systems that have<br>been involved in disasters<br>really and tries to unpick Common<br>patterns and the patterns he picks up<br>are that most disasters involve four<br>things they involve an active error so<br>somebody using the technology does<br>something stupid with it or something<br>ill advised or something ill-informed<br>and that couples with a latent error<br>somewhere in the guts of the system and<br>it's that combination that produces the<br>unpredictable disastrous<br>effect and it's more likely when two<br>conditions are met<br>when the things in the system are<br>complexly<br>interl so it isn't that one thing is<br>just connected to one other thing but<br>the connections<br>ramify and also when the elements of the<br>system are tightly rather than Loosely<br>coupled if something's tightly coupled<br>the effect flows through it almost<br>immediately almost automatically if it's<br>Loosely coupled there's a gap yeah and<br>you see this today with some of the<br>discussions around connectionist<br>artificial intelligence yeah there aren<br>many people who are utterly resistant to<br>artificial intelligence the resistance<br>is rather I don't want it deciding on<br>its own yeah and if I go back to my time<br>with the oil refiner one of the mantras<br>that I heard throughout that is we don't<br>want to do jobs people's jobs for them<br>we want to do about 70% of their job for<br>them but we want them to fill in the<br>remaining bit that's the safety check<br>that's the the the<br>balance and the second book there is the<br>uh brilliant but toxic Martin haider's<br>uh question concerning<br>technology it's heiger who talks about<br>this notion of turning the world into a<br>standing<br>Reserve through the ways in which modern<br>Technologies represent it but in the<br>process of doing that we we tend to<br>create gigantic representation<br>that become ever more<br>all-encompassing and instead of<br>Technology helping us with the problems<br>that we found in the world we<br>increasingly find ourselves spending our<br>time using technology to address the<br>problems that the technology we've<br>deployed in the world has created<br>because of the gigantic system that we<br>now have of<br>interconnection it's a dog chasing its<br>tail if you want an image to try<br>and capture this now that sort of thing<br>is rendered in tragic comedy terms in<br>films like Terry gillams<br>Brazil for those of you who've not seen<br>it again I<br>recommend the uh that's Robert dairo on<br>the left there he is a terrorist heating<br>engineer in a totalitarian system in<br>which the hitching Engineers that the<br>system supplies can never Sol<br>the problem with the technology they put<br>the wrong size beam in they they they<br>they bring a fitting that related to the<br>old iteration of the<br>system Bob just swoops through the<br>window comes in puts a pipe between the<br>ducts that aren't connected and swoops<br>out again yeah in the process of an<br>arrest warrant being generated for him a<br>fly falls into the printer and rather<br>than the warrant being for btle for<br>Tuttle it becomes for but tle so Tuttle<br>is the Robert dairo character the uh the<br>uh terrorist heating engineer and butle<br>is Sam in the film the um the this the<br>central character who endlessly dreams<br>of flying away and eventually loses his<br>mind it's a film that's way too long but<br>certainly about the first half hour is<br>among amongst the most visually<br>arresting imagery of what a dystopia<br>technological future can and does look<br>like here's a rather more sobering and<br>real example from much closer to the<br>present<br>day the imagery to your right is the<br>wreckage of a Boeing um 737 Max that<br>went down in Ethiopia killing I think<br>everybody on board about 140<br>people and the fleet of these planes was<br>grounded for a period afterwards because<br>it wasn't the only<br>such incident and what seemed to be<br>going on in the background was that a<br>well-meaning attempt on the part of a<br>piece of software to make sure that the<br>plane didn't lose<br>height when taking<br>off was doing battle with the more<br>situated understanding of the unfolding<br>circumstance of the pilot and overriding<br>the pilot and crashing the plane into<br>the ground preventing the pilot or<br>reinterpreting the Pilot's attempts to<br>take ameliorative<br>action with the result of loss of life<br>life and technology so my core ongoing<br>interest and this this collection of<br>work by edited by John law came out in<br>86 I think when what was called actor<br>Network Theory or one of the strands of<br>the kind of Sociology of knowledge and<br>Technology was first coming into being<br>and it's a series of essays by the Great<br>and the good in in in that emerging area<br>and what they're really trying to get at<br>is how do people and things build<br>networks of each other and who gets to<br>speak for those networks who gets to<br>represent them who gets to own them<br>effectively who gets to claim their<br>benefits it's not really sociology<br>because there's much more technology in<br>it than you'd normally get in sociology<br>it's more an ass sociology how do things<br>how are they built into networks who<br>speaks for those networks and how do<br>those networks Marshall and deal with<br>the competing interests of the elements<br>now in more recent work with my<br>colleagues in the anthropos scine<br>research group those uh weird and<br>wonderful<br>geologists we have been trying to look<br>at the ways in which that form of<br>understanding might enable better<br>responses to the emerging<br>anthropy<br>might that way of thinking enable us to<br>find ways of talking to carbon and<br>finding out what it<br>wants might it f help us find ways of<br>talking to covid might it help us find<br>ways of talking to water might it help<br>us find ways of opening up the very<br>narrow and short-term Cycles associated<br>with standard business decision making<br>with the very much more longer term<br>cycle in many cases and Cycles working<br>at different scales and Scopes that make<br>up the Earth system that we are<br>increasingly disturbing to the point<br>where it will be<br>unsustainable now that invocation of the<br>notion of representation and democracy<br>is<br>deliberate just as we have a number of<br>disenfranchised populations that find it<br>hard to have their voice heard and we<br>strive to find ways of bringing them<br>into<br>conversation we do that because that's<br>the best way of dealing with this<br>because if you don't do that you are<br>confronted by people with pitchforks and<br>torches and masses of anger yeah and the<br>same same thing is going with the<br>constit going on at the moment with the<br>constituents of the earth system we can<br>either find ways of commerc and<br>conversing with those systems better to<br>better understand them and better bring<br>them into our decision making or they<br>won't bother to talk to us they will<br>out they won't Wipe Out the world<br>they'll just wipe out the irritating<br>species that we've become in the<br>realization of the benefits of scale of<br>the advantages of centers of<br>calculation enriched by these traveling<br>as representations of different aspects<br>of the world to allow command over a a<br>large scale of terrain and<br>time violence is happening various<br>voices are being shut down as well as<br>spokespersons for conglomerations of<br>gathered materials are coming into being<br>and getting heard as Michelle Colon says<br>in that uh article in that collection I<br>was I just put up to speak for others is<br>to First silence those in whose name we<br>speak and that hand some chap to your<br>scollop kalon's paper in that uh<br>collection was about the scollops and<br>the fishermen at St Brio Bay off uh the<br>coast of France and as various people<br>looking at their article have pointed<br>out ever since the scollop never speaks<br>to us directly somebody always has got<br>to intervene and speak for the<br>scholp now if that's a benign<br>power in relation to the scholp that's<br>probably to the scolopes good but it<br>might not<br>be<br>so I'm currently working then on an<br>agenda of how we bring through<br>representation the voices the concerns<br>the interests of what we previously<br>considered to be inanimate matter into<br>our considerations because it's becoming<br>increasingly important that we<br>do but to do that we probably need<br>experts we probably need scientists<br>artists those who find ways of<br>understanding the interests and speaking<br>for the otherwise mute elements of the<br>world that we need to attend to but<br>expertise is in bad adur at the<br>moment and it's inad adur both from the<br>unprincipled and opportunistic right as<br>much as it is from the principled or and<br>indeed first principled arguments of a<br>rather more reflective<br>left and the tension is an age-old one<br>the tension between democracy and<br>technocracy we need expertise we need<br>expertise to make the right Democratic<br>decisions but if only those who are<br>credentialed and authorized to speak in<br>that<br>way are the voices that heard then<br>democracy<br>dies and as uh Terren Karen has pointed<br>out uh with his colleagues Terrence<br>obviously not long ago of this<br>Parish the balance that one can possibly<br>put in place there is academic<br>freedom the rigorous disputation by<br>informed<br>others of the author the authoritative<br>thing but as Terren and others have<br>highlighted protections for academic<br>freedom in the UK are notable most<br>obviously by their absence there's a lot<br>of lip service paid but you never find<br>out whether your academic freedom is<br>protected or not until in<br>practice which takes me<br>on to I think my last but one slide<br>you'll be pleased to know and my latest<br>book coming out uh is impress at the<br>moment it's out later this year looks at<br>a case study of change at a British<br>University<br>according to the<br>law academics enjoy freedom to question<br>and test received wisdom and put forward<br>new ideas and controversial or unpopular<br>opinions without placing themselves in<br>Jeopardy of losing their jobs or<br>privileges but the case we look at<br>involves the dismissal by reason of<br>redundancy of academic staff because of<br>a strategic decision on the part of the<br>university in question to disinvent best<br>from research characterized in their<br>words in the italics at the<br>End by as entailing a profound<br>questioning of the authority and<br>relevance of mainstream thinking and<br>practice it's virtually unchallengeable<br>an employment tribunal has no interest<br>in academic<br>freedom if you try and take this to<br>judicial review you will hit the bipoc<br>in the institutional nature of an<br>institution<br>such as a university a university is a<br>public body and has public duties<br>associated with it when it is performing<br>as a public institution included amongst<br>those would be the protection of<br>academic<br>freedom when an institution such as a<br>university chooses however to make a<br>strategic decision then it is acting as<br>a private body and when it acts as a<br>private<br>so drawing to a close what's the point<br>what's the point of all this<br>particularly when there's no wine<br>afterwards what's the<br>point the point I think is to understand<br>how the world's put<br>together and to try and do that in novel<br>ways because understanding it in<br>different ways increases our potential<br>purchase upon it and if we understand<br>the way in which the world's been put<br>together and is producing effects that<br>we don't don't particularly like we've<br>probably got more chance of resolving<br>them and addressing them and so my final<br>substantive slide is the compulsory<br>lengthy quotation from a literary Source<br>uh in this case I've gone for Kurt vonet<br>slaughter house 5 if you haven't read it<br>uh Central character is Billy and all<br>you really need to know about Billy is<br>that he has a curious relationship with<br>the world and time and often Witnesses<br>things backwards and in the particular<br>instance I'm going to share with you<br>what he Witnesses backwards is a film<br>Germany American Planes full of holes<br>and wounded men and corpses took off<br>backwards from an Airfield in England<br>over France a few German fighter planes<br>flew at them backwards sucked bullets<br>and shell fragments from some of the<br>planes and crewman they did the same for<br>wrecked American bombers on the ground<br>and those planes flew up backwards to<br>join the<br>formation the formation flew backwards<br>over a German city that was in Flames<br>the bombers opened their Bombay doors<br>exerted a miraculous magnetism which<br>Shrunk the fires gathered them into<br>cylindrical steel containers and lifted<br>the containers into the bellies of the<br>machines sorry the bellies of the planes<br>the containers were stored neatly in<br>racks the Germans Below had miraculous<br>devices of their own which were long<br>Steel tubes they used them to suck more<br>fragments from the crewman and PLS but<br>there were still a few wounded Americans<br>though and some of the bombers were in<br>bad repair over France though German<br>Fighters came up again made everything<br>and everybody as good as new when the<br>bombers got back to their base the steel<br>cylinders were taken from the racks and<br>shipped back to the United States of<br>America where factories were operating<br>night and day dismantling the cylinders<br>separating the dangerous contents into<br>min minerals touchingly it was mainly<br>women who did this work the minerals<br>were then shipped to specialists in<br>remote areas it was their business to<br>put them back into the ground to hide<br>them cleverly so they would never hurt<br>anyone<br>again thanks for listening any<br>questions</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
