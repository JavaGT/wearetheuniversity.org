In this presentation, Dr. Kevin Rose will discuss his research to understand the causes of large-scale changes in lakes, focusing on how dissolved oxygen concentrations are responding to climate change and the implications of aquatic deoxygenation for global-scale processes. Dr. Rose will also discuss his lab group’s research on understanding the factors that lead to the formation of harmful algal blooms. Nearly all multicellular life depends on oxygen availability, and the loss of dissolved oxygen can create conditions favourable to the formation of harmful algal blooms. These blooms can produce toxins that are harmful to people and wildlife. However, despite the importance and impacts of harmful algal blooms, they have so far generally resisted prediction. Dr. Rose will highlight how sensors, models, and large volumes of data are being used to understand both changes in dissolved oxygen in lakes around the world and the factors that stimulate harmful algal blooms. By understanding the factors contributing to algal blooms, Dr. Rose will highlight a pathway to forecasting these important events.<br><br>Dr. Rose leads a research team based at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, USA. His research spans ecology and biogeochemistry and focuses predominantly on understanding broad-scale patterns and processes at the ecosystem and macrosystem scale. His group focuses on freshwater ecosystems such as lakes and ponds, because they represent archetypal sites to develop and test ecological theory and provide critical services to society. A goal of his lab group is to forecast the future state of aquatic ecosystems in a regional to global context, with an emphasis on understanding how freshwater ecosystems are changing in response to factors such as land use and climate change. This interdisciplinary research draws on diverse skills in biology, ecology, biogeochemistry, advanced environmental sensors, and computational modelling. His research findings have been published in high-impact journals such as Science and Nature and featured in media outlets such as NPR, the Washington Post, Fox News, and Popular Science magazine.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>people joining on but which just Mak<br>actually supp be really nice all right<br>guys thanks everybody for coming uh to<br>today's ER seminar um yeah I'm glad you<br>can join us and welcome to people online<br>um it's fantastic to see quite a<br>diversity of people in the audience<br>today and for those who don't know me<br>I'm Dennis esonda I'm a freshwater<br>scientist here at the University in the<br>School of Science and we're really<br>pleased to have Kevin with us for a<br>sabatical um and so just a short<br>introduction to Kevin Kevin is an<br>associate professor at The rensler<br>politch Institute in New York USA where<br>he leads an interdisciplinary research<br>team uh spending ecology bi geochemistry<br>development of advanced environmental<br>sensors and computational modeling um<br>with a focus on understanding broadscale<br>patterns and processes at ecosystem and<br>microsystem scale so um Kevin holds the<br>Frederick our colleague 52 career<br>development shair in freshwater ecology<br>he's

science<br>and nature and featur the media Outlets<br>such as the national Radio National<br>Public Radio Washington Post Fox News<br>and Popular Science magazine um so very<br>privileged to uh have Kevin with us uh<br>for the six months of youle um and I'm<br>handing over to you for the seminar<br>thanks great thank you Dennis thank you<br>all for coming thank you for people that<br>are<br>online as Dennis mentioned my name is<br>Kevin Rose um I've got number of topics<br>I'm going to cover first a brief<br>introduction to who I am what of my<br>study systems where I'm from and then<br>talking about majority of this talk will<br>be about dissolved oxygen why it's<br>important what do we understand about<br>how dissolved auction is changing and<br>then transitioning into harmful ablums<br>and some research we're doing on<br>understanding harmful aoms and<br>forecasting them understanding their<br>Dynamics so uh as Dennis mentioned um I<br>came here is this first is that okay<br>that does work um so I'm here in<br>sabatical I arrived in December um so<br>I've got my wife and kids with me we're<br>here um at University of wetto until<br>July mid July so um I'm happy to meet<br>with others in set of meetings of after<br>this uh anytime over the next four<br>months or so um I come from upstate New<br>York right near Albany which is the<br>capital of New York state from as Dennis<br>mentioned rer poly Technic<br>Institute um my research as Dennis was<br>saying um involves understanding<br>large-scale environmental change and how<br>it impacts lakes and fresh freshwater<br>ecosystems in particular so um<br>characterizing the effects of<br>environmental change for Lakes the<br>organisms that inhabit them represents a<br>major challenge in ecology um two topics<br>I'm going to talk about today are<br>dissolved oxygen and nutrification in<br>Alo blooms another topic that my<br>research group focuses a lot on is<br>acidification and recovery from<br>acidification that's something that's<br>been happening in for example in the<br>Northeast us where uh I work but is not<br>an issue here as far as I'm aware um so<br>I won't be talking about that today um a<br>lot of my study systems are in New York<br>um so on the map on the lower left is<br>the Northeast us and I've highlighted<br>the ADC Park in particular that's the<br>largest state park in the lower 48 so in<br>the lower 48 states in the United States<br>um and it's got about 3,000 Lakes over<br>10 hectares or larger um if you go to<br>smaller surface areas it grows ex faster<br>than<br>exponentially um as Dennis mentioned I'm<br>also the acting director of the Darren<br>freshwater Institute which is my<br>University's Field Station on Lake<br>George which is in in the adun deck Park<br>it's a roughly 50 km Long Lake legat<br>Tropic Lake where a lot of our research<br>is done and a picture on the upper right<br>is a picture of our Field Station um and<br>at this field station we've been<br>operating a partnership with a few other<br>organizations um including um IBM<br>research and Lake George Association<br>which is not for-profit focused on on um<br>water quality there um with this<br>partnership it's called The Jefferson<br>project at Lake George this is in<br>Partnership as I mentioned with the LGA<br>Lake George Association IBM research<br>we're combining a lot of cutting edged<br>Technologies I say cutting edged they<br>are to often to the general public but<br>to this audience they often won't be and<br>in fact a lot of what we have mirrors a<br>lot of what you have here uh vertical<br>profilers we have several of our own<br>homebuilt vertical profilers at this<br>point uh weather stations going up and<br>down a lake tributary monitoring<br>stations on the lake and adcps or<br>acoustic Doppler current profilers that<br>we can use to look at what are mass<br>movement um vertical horizontal<br>velocities turbidity concentration<br>particle particle movement Etc um we<br>ingest all of this data plus roughly a<br>little over at this year this point 40<br>Years of historic water quality<br>monitoring data for visualizations we've<br>got something what we call scenario<br>engine which is essentially long-term<br>forecasting for different scenarios um<br>and operationally we have a series of<br>different models that we use so we have<br>uh we have we run uh land surface and<br>weather models down to weather models<br>are down to 111 meter spatial resolution<br>which is incredibly fine scale um we<br>find that actually makes our<br>hydrodynamic modeling much more accurate<br>right and the two the two are work hand<br>and glove so we use um weather models<br>and runoff models to then drive<br>hydrodynamic models which then we can<br>look at runoff and pollutants like<br>increases in solinity is something we're<br>seeing in the Northeast us quite a bit<br>with road salt applications<br>uh we look at circulation water mass<br>movement and then the chemistry and<br>biology nutrient uh nutrient cycling um<br>npz models for example nutrients<br>phytoplankton so Plankton um Etc and all<br>of these are coupled together so that's<br>a little bit about who I am and where I<br>work now I'm going to get into okay show<br>me the data show me some some patterns<br>show me what you've actually discovered<br>so far so a little bit of context uh for<br>research this is a paper by Katherine<br>O'Reilly published in 2015 geophysical<br>research letters using Institute data<br>and remotely sensed data to look at<br>surface water summer surface water<br>temperatures and they showed on average<br>a median temperature increase of about<br>34 degrees per decade um that number<br>I'll come back to but that's roughly<br>what we continue to see is3 to point4<br>degrees per decade but Lakes generally<br>are warming some are cooling and I could<br>get into why um and um in another<br>lecture but we know that Lakes are<br>definitely being um exposed to climate<br>change and are warming as a response one<br>of our first questions that we started<br>asking in 2016 was okay with Lakes<br>swming what's going to be the effect on<br>the chemistry of these systems and<br>biology spec specifically thinking about<br>dissolved oxygen Dynamics and what are<br>the effects of climate change on aquatic<br>dissolved oxygen concentrations why<br>dissolved oxygen you know we know that<br>systems will undergo if you lose oxygen<br>you undergo this Redux ladder where you<br>um you lose your an uh arobic<br>metabolizers first and then you move<br>down with the end stage being<br>methanogenesis and also not only are we<br>going to alter the chemical reactions<br>that occur in the water column or the<br>sediments depending on the oxygen<br>concentrations and the duration of an<br>oxia for example but then aquatic<br>organisms are very sensitive to to disol<br>oxygen some of the most sensive species<br>such a certain species of trout start to<br>exhibit abnormal behaviors starting at<br>even 5 milligrams per liter dissolved<br>oxygen that's pretty high um and I used<br>to say all complex life dis depends on<br>dissolved oxygen and that got the<br>microbial ecologists really upset<br>because they said well this is complex<br>life too even just because it's single<br>cell doesn't mean it's not complex and I<br>said okay well then it's only you know<br>multicellular life or multicellular life<br>depends on dissolved oy then I had a<br>colleague come up to me from scripts and<br>say that's not true either there's some<br>organisms in the ocean and this paper um<br>was published in nature<br>a couple years ago that they found these<br>uh these metazoans some multicellular<br>metazoans in the ocean um surviving at<br>basically close to as close we can let<br>measure it um to zero you know complete<br>anoxia that they're surviving in so I<br>say the vast vast majority of Life<br>complex life depends on oxygen dissolved<br>oxygen so complex life in general<br>requires oxygen is climate warming driv<br>Global Lake oxygen loss is our Central<br>research question and we started um This<br>research in 2016 as I mentioned and then<br>the very following year as we're Midway<br>getting into this project um this paper<br>came out by Schmid Co at all in nature<br>focused on the oceans and showing that<br>the oxygen content in the oceans has<br>declined about 2% since<br>1960 and and so that's not a very large<br>proportion but there were a lot of areas<br>where oxygen is historically been low<br>there's oxygen minimum zones and there's<br>coastal areas where there has been<br>historically a lot of hypoxia so this<br>can push a lot of systems Beyond<br>critical thresholds in terms of<br>biogeochemical feedbacks and um<br>survivorship of of U some types of<br>organisms but we asked is a similar<br>phenomena occurring in freshwaters in<br>some ways we might say yes you know if<br>we look at the relationship between<br>oxygen content and temperature a<br>dissolved oxygen concentration goes down<br>as temperature goes up because of the<br>solubility of oxygen and water goes down<br>with that and we know it depends on the<br>salinity of the water and that's fairly<br>predictable so we asked our Lakes just<br>small oceans you know would we expect to<br>see similar phenomena and we said we<br>would not expect the same why because<br>the lakes are generally much more<br>productive than the oceans and so we are<br>we have much larger gradients in<br>productivity um and we know for example<br>this is a paper from Gabriel van draer<br>in 2010 showing that this is one over KT<br>um so higher temperatures are actually<br>on the left hand side of this axis but<br>as temperature goes up so moving to the<br>left on this axis metabolism metabolic<br>rates also increase so if we have a lot<br>more productivity in our Lakes than we<br>do in the open oceans we might expect a<br>biological feedback that consumes more<br>oxygen as temperature goes up we also<br>know we're seeing observed changes in<br>ice cover and stratification that can<br>regulate oxygen Dynamics as well so he<br>asked how are lakes responding to<br>temperature warming um so we started<br>this um leading this project in<br>organization called gon Global Lake<br>ecological Observatory Network which is<br>actually how I met Dennis and actually<br>several others of you in this room um<br>and we were able to compile a data set<br>of about 440 lakes that had profiles of<br>dissolved oxygen and temperature we set<br>a minimum of at least 15 years of data<br>um the mean number of years of data was<br>24 years totaling about 24,000 profiles<br>each for dissolved auction and and<br>temperature profiles um in the center<br>here we can we show that uh the data SPS<br>going back to 1941 researchers on lake<br>kkin and Sweden were starting to collect<br>data even in the you know middle of<br>World War II uh and those were that was<br>the earliest data set we could get the<br>data really start to pick up around 1980<br>and especially 1990 onward is where<br>we've got a lot lot more data where a<br>lot more monitoring was going on uh we<br>can see the leftand map the red dots<br>indicate our study sites we're<br>definitely not well represented in a lot<br>of areas of the world right a lot of<br>Africa um nothing in South America had<br>met our data requirements that we could<br>find but the coverage that we did had<br>which was primarily the US Europe and<br>actually a decent amount of lakes from<br>New Zealand um represents the<br>distribution of where Lakes are<br>concentrated around the around the<br>planet uh we organized this by profiles<br>we separated these by surface water and<br>deep water so we looked at Trends<br>separately surface waters we defined as<br>the top two meters of the water column<br>and deep Waters in the bottom two meters<br>of the water column if the lake was<br>stratified um if it wasn't stratified<br>then we only looked at the top two<br>meters of the water column um and we use<br>that data set to ask how how is dissed<br>auction changing globally do Trends vary<br>with depth and what explains warming<br>induced solubility losses um can observe<br>Trends be explained by warming into<br>solubility losses alone so we know<br>systems are warming so let's get into<br>the data um this plot shows our surface<br>water data our surface water<br>measurements so um in the right hand<br>side here um we can see surface water<br>temperatures have increased and<br>dissolved oxygen generally has decreased<br>our warming rate that we observed was 39<br>degrees per decade recall back to what I<br>showed for Katherine O'Reilly's paper<br>was 3 four degrees per decade so<br>actually Rel relatively similar using a<br>lot of different lakes over a different<br>time period so I was good to see that<br>consistency the plot in the upper left<br>shows our expected change in dissolved<br>oxygen due to solubility changes versus<br>our observe change in uh observe change<br>in dissolved oxygen concentrations so<br>that means we would expect due to<br>solubility alone some changes in<br>dissolved oxygen how much should we see<br>versus how much should we expect to see<br>the side alone if all of the changes<br>were due to you know physics alone just<br>that change in solubility all of them<br>would lie right on that black line that<br>oneto one line the Blue Line shows the<br>low s smoother of it and actually that<br>blue blue lowest smoother actually falls<br>very close to that Ono one line overall<br>um suggesting that our changes in<br>surface water dissolved oxygen<br>concentrations actually reflect our<br>changes in solubility fairly well<br>there's a lot of variation across<br>systems a lot of that is driven by<br>uncertainty in our Trends um and a lot<br>of those Trends are fairly<br>weak and there are other dynamics that I<br>can get into that explain things on a<br>case-by casee basis what I'm looking for<br>here is just generally overarching<br>patterns too so surface waters in<br>general like I said that blue lowest<br>smoother is fairly close to one to one<br>line saying the population level change<br>is well explained by U by changes in<br>solubility um but that represents about<br>a 5 and a half% loss since 1980 so 5 a<br>half% loss in dissolved oxygen<br>concentrations meanwhile deep waterer<br>dissolved oxygen Dynamics same plot here<br>on the lower left where we're looking at<br>expected change in dissolved Ox due to<br>solubility changes versus The observed<br>change in dissolved oxy there you know<br>there's a there's a cluster of lakes<br>around you know zero change in expected<br>change of solubility um but on the<br>observed we see a wide range quite a<br>large really looks like a shotgun blast<br>there and in terms of temperature Trends<br>our median trend for temperature for<br>deep water temperatures was actually<br>negative so despite the fact that<br>surface waters were warming decently<br>rapid rapidly um deep water temperatures<br>were not warming dis and um and<br>dissolved oxygen concentrations were<br>declining and that represents close to a<br>20% decrease in dissolved oxygen since<br>since<br>1980 so I probably attribute that to the<br>reason why this got accepted in nature<br>um because that's an absolutely enormous<br>number um part of the percentages can<br>hide something really important which is<br>that the reason why it's a very large<br>percentage because if you look the rate<br>of dissolved oxygen decline is actually<br>fairly similar to surface waters but the<br>percentage is a much larger percentage<br>because hypolimnetic water start out<br>often at very low do concentrations to<br>begin with so our median dissolved<br>oxygen concentration at the beginning of<br>the period was something like 3 to 4<br>milligrams per liter and so so when<br>we're losing even a small amount of that<br>it's a relatively large<br>percentage so um so then we started to<br>to dive into okay what exactly is<br>explaining these Trends is it um<br>increases in temperature and consequent<br>reductions in solubility is it changes<br>in consumption rates so biological<br>feedbacks occurring is it onset or<br>changes in stratification that that are<br>occurring so first in terms of the deep<br>water temperatures I already gave it<br>gave that away which is deep water<br>temperatures here are not changing right<br>our Trend was um surface water<br>temperatures were increasing we saw this<br>deal scale pattern um which actually is<br>driven by a lot of large lakes of Europe<br>mostly that only mix every few years to<br>the bottom so they build up heat and<br>then they'll mix and cool down and so we<br>tended to see overarching population<br>level Trend driven by by those larger<br>Lakes but if we look at the distribution<br>of Trends and our temperature Trends<br>here deep Waters in blue are not warming<br>the center of that distribution is right<br>at Zero versus the surface waters was<br>much faster was warming quite<br>substantially another paper that came<br>out the year before Ours by Rachel fill<br>at all which actually used a lot of the<br>same data but not not completely there<br>wasn't perfect overlap showed similar<br>Trend where surface water temperatures<br>were increasing by 37 degrees per decade<br>and they showed in their analysis deep<br>water Trends were basically close to<br>zero right they showed a very slightly<br>slight positive overall median<br>Trend but our net is that net result is<br>that there is basically no warming<br>across all these hundreds of lakes and<br>so we wouldn't expect or solubility<br>doesn't explain changes in solubility<br>don't do not um explain our changes in<br>dis oxygen losses so with solubility<br>ruled out is it changes in deep waterer<br>dissolved oxygen consumption rates and<br>so what we mean by that if we look at um<br>dissolved oxygen concentrations on a<br>seasonal basis often times we see<br>something like this where early in the<br>season our dissolved oxygen<br>concentration is high and this is North<br>North hemisphere Centric so early in the<br>season being April May and June<br>dissolved oxygen concentrations are high<br>when when the water column is often<br>mixing deeply and we're getting mixing<br>of that atmospheric oxygen into our deep<br>Waters when the Lakes then stratify and<br>we're talking about monomictic or<br>dimictic lakes often here and that's<br>what our analysis was focused on for<br>Deep Water Dynamics<br>uh we often see that dissolved oxygen<br>concentrations decrease often remarkably<br>linearly off over the course of that<br>stratified season until the point where<br>they should reach zero and then they'll<br>Flatline for a while um and then<br>stratification eventually breaks down in<br>a fall and we get renewal or mixing of<br>atmospheric oxygen<br>concentrations if we see an increase in<br>deep water dissolved oxygen consumption<br>rates we would see this as reflected as<br>the red line and an increasingly steep<br>slope over time right where there the<br>oxygen is drawn down more rapidly and<br>this can occur for example if we get<br>more inputs of laile organic matter if<br>temperature increases you know these<br>factors can increase microb respiration<br>rates<br>alternatively we can see changes in<br>stratification phology so this is things<br>like the onset or duration of<br>stratification U so s similar starting<br>diagram but if stratification starts<br>occurring earlier and earlier then we're<br>shifting that entire line to the left on<br>that diagram we're not sh changing the<br>slope of that line we're just shifting<br>it to the left so so it's in parallel<br>but our analysis for um the the nature<br>paper is focused on the July and August<br>time period and so if we're looking at<br>July and August even if the rate of<br>oxygen consumption hasn't increased but<br>oxygen consumption starts earlier by the<br>time we get to that July and August time<br>frame then we're going to see lower<br>dissolved oxygen concentrations so we<br>ask okay what is it is it and is it both<br>perhaps but do we see changes in our<br>consumption rates or do we see changes<br>in our stratification phenology um the<br>other thing too that our study actually<br>doesn't even address at all is that<br>stratification breakdown is also<br>shifting later in the year so we focused<br>on this July and August time frame<br>because we said well that's probably the<br>time frame when most lakes have the<br>lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations<br>but if stratification is also shifting<br>later and it is that time frame of the<br>most severe oxygen depletion is actually<br>probably also shifting later and so our<br>study period might not even represent<br>the most critical time period um for for<br>lakes in the future so jumping into some<br>results this is a distribution of Trends<br>in our deep water consumption rates<br>right so if our um if our if our liines<br>are getting steeper here meaning<br>consumption rates are increasing we<br>would see this these consumption rates<br>start to increase right and this the<br>distribution of Trends would be shifted<br>to the right here meaning that our our<br>consumption rates are increasing over<br>time they were centered right at zero<br>the the median dissolved auction<br>consumption rate was centered right at<br>zero and at least for this was you know<br>for the lakes that we had data for so<br>this is a subset of the 440 Lakes this<br>was about 150 175 Lakes for which we had<br>these data for and what we think is<br>happening is we see a wide range of<br>patterns across Lakes is that some Lakes<br>are increasing in that dissolved oxygen<br>consumption rate and know those Lakes<br>it's factors like neut tropication<br>Browning you know more sources of labile<br>organic matter but then we also see the<br>opposite Trends where some are actually<br>slowing down so that rate of deep water<br>dissolved oxygen consumption is is being<br>mediated over time by things like<br>pollution controls right reductions in<br>phosphorus inputs nitrogen inputs or<br>some types of invasive species um for<br>example invasive quag muscles and zebra<br>muscles filter out a lot of that organic<br>matter and improve water Clarity reduce<br>productivity and we've seen really clear<br>evidence in some of our Lakes where when<br>those invasive species inv invasive<br>filter feeders come in that we see<br>improved dissolve oxygen concentrations<br>as a result that's not true obviously<br>for all invasive<br>species um so so we really there ruled<br>out deep waterer dissolved oxygen<br>consumption rates do not explain overall<br>the trend toward um deoxygenation that<br>we're seeing<br>what does what does explain it though<br>really well if we look at the onset of<br>stratification the breakdown of<br>stratification and the overall duration<br>of stratification we see pretty<br>consistent patterns toward earlier onset<br>of stratification by 1.4 days per decade<br>um and then later Strat you know<br>breakdown of stratification by 2.5 days<br>per decade and an overall increase in<br>the duration of stratification by 3.8<br>stratification um overall stratification<br>earlier onset of stratification We<br>Believe provides more time for dissolved<br>oxygen draw draw down in in deep Waters<br>help hence explaining why we're seeing<br>much faster rates of dissolved oxygen<br>losses and Trends toward deoxygenation<br>than would be predicted based on<br>solubility alone for example now the<br>concern really gets into the future here<br>because we know that stratification is<br>changing and that is consistent with we<br>see our surface water temperatures<br>increasing but our deep water<br>temperatures are not increasing so the<br>temperature difference between our<br>surface waters and deep Waters is<br>increasing that acts as a greater<br>barrier to mixing and a greater barrier<br>to atmospheric renewal of oxygen into<br>our deep Waters projections by yes and<br>wway published in nature Communications<br>in 2020 show that exactly what we've<br>found is what we expect to see over the<br>coming decades um so we showed that um<br>we're looking at was a trend 3.8 days<br>per decade overall increase and the<br>duration of stratification and they<br>showed that over you know over the next<br>80 years or so under the fastest forming<br>scenario the red line for example we're<br>expecting to see another up to a month<br>or more increase in the duration<br>stratification so it's likely our our<br>data indicate that uh you we see<br>widespread deoxygenation occurring<br>driven largely in deep Waters by earlier<br>onset of stratification and this is<br>likely to continue into the<br>future um and that just summarizes so<br>warmer temperatures so to summarize the<br>dissolved oxygen section here dissolved<br>oxygen um you know the warmer<br>temperatures is causing reduced Doo<br>solubility in our surface waters<br>consistent with ice loss warming<br>temperatures climate change is Shifting<br>the onset of stratification earlier<br>resulting in more time for deep water<br>deoxygenation our breakdown the<br>breakdown of stratification also<br>shifting later so our severity of do<br>losses is perhaps greater than our<br>analyses indicate and that time period<br>is probably shifting to the Early to<br>late fall when ecosystems when deep<br>water habitats are becoming the most<br>stressed and deoxygenation is projected<br>to continue or perhaps amplify in coming<br>decades from a management P perspective<br>um the you know dissolved oxygen is<br>critically important for nutrient<br>cycling for aquatic habitat for<br>organisms Etc and the question becomes<br>how do we locally manage do<br>concentrations when the dominant driver<br>of deoxygenation is a global process<br>right remember I said it's not due to<br>changes on the net of changes in<br>productivity for example now it will be<br>and when you we see for example<br>increases in productivity in places<br>that'll amplify these problems but this<br>becomes an challenge for what resource<br>managers and I think the answer is that<br>this puts even more emphasis on the need<br>for ProActive Management to reduce<br>nutrient inputs to reduce organic matter<br>loading<br>Etc okay stepping bigger picture for a<br>minute I showed the paper from Schmid Co<br>all 2017 that showed Global um oxygen<br>losses in the oceans Denise braberg um<br>also has a paper on look showing hypoxic<br>areas in coastal zones all around the<br>world um published a review paper in<br>2018 in science U and deoxygenation is<br>really a global phenomena and now it's<br>been consistently shown across from the<br>open oceans to the coastal zones to<br>Inland Waters then there's even been<br>some recent papers that are showing that<br>this is increasingly a problem in river<br>systems as well and so working with<br>Denise breitberg her group and some<br>other oceanographers we just have a<br>paper accepted in nature ecology and<br>evolution show proposing deoxygenation<br>as um I'll get into this more in a<br>minute a new planetary<br>boundary um and take-home here is that<br>if we look at across you know Marine<br>systems to coastal zones to Inland<br>Waters to you know including Lakes<br>reservoirs and rivers and streams<br>deoxygenation is caused by a small<br>number across all those different types<br>of ecosystems in a reduced solubility<br>under warming B increases in<br>stratification strength duration Etc and<br>C increases in organic matter loading or<br>nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen um all<br>three of those things you know the<br>relative importance of those varies<br>based on on our ecosystem type and where<br>we're located but those are the common<br>drivers across it why does this really<br>matter well rockstrom at all in a paper<br>published in nature in 2009 and Then<br>followed up um by a review by Stefan at<br>all 2015 and science proposed what they<br>called um planetary boundaries and this<br>is a series of nine interacting Earth<br>system processes that regulate the<br>stability and habitability of the planet<br>and they talk about things like<br>freshwater use land system change land<br>use land cover change um novel entities<br>novel entities being things like<br>microplastics or pcbs or other things<br>climate change biosphere integrity mean<br>meaning extinctions per million species<br>years um stratospheric ozone depletion<br>atmospheric alol loading etc etc and<br>when we look at aquatic dissolved oxygen<br>not only looking at freshwaters now but<br>looking at marine ecosystems and Coastal<br>EOS systems aquatic dissolved oxygen and<br>the trend toward deoxidation regulates a<br>lot of these other PL anary boundaries<br>and sometimes in complex ways right<br>aquatic dissolved oxygen by altering<br>whether the dominant form of metabolism<br>can be anerobic or aerobic Alters the<br>whether or not we end up resulting in<br>CO2 production or methane production and<br>hence feedbacks to climate change um and<br>regulates the rate of organic carbon<br>burial or nitrous oxide production Etc<br>and so we're proposing that aquatic<br>dissolved auction represents a planetary<br>boundary because it's both impacted by<br>these other changes like I just talked<br>about climate change and stratification<br>but then it also has these really<br>important feedbacks to these other<br>planetary boundaries when aggregated at<br>a global<br>scale okay so that summarizes what I<br>want to talk about with dissolved oxygen<br>Trends and patterns in Lake sub otion<br>drivers of lake deoxygenation and<br>proposing deoxygenation as a 10th<br>planetary boundary um now I'm going to<br>get into harmful algo blooms and<br>relating that to dissed oxygen Dynamics<br>but then moving a little bit into a new<br>space that my group has been working on<br>and trying to forecast changes in<br>productivity and harmful LS so another<br>central question we've been working with<br>is how will Lake productivity respond to<br>climate warming um first productivity<br>and dissolved oxygen are coupled right<br>um higher productivity um we often see<br>you know higher um higher concentrations<br>of dissolved oxygen surface waters for<br>for example um productivity controls<br>carbon cycling Fisheries water quality<br>evaluations Etc we know harmful loms are<br>are a manifestation that occurs when we<br>often get high productivity but not<br>necessarily and harab Booms pose<br>substantial economic and ecological<br>threats um there's lots of reviews on<br>this we can get into people are<br>interested it there's multiple ways we<br>can let me dial step back for a sec um<br>multiple ways or Pathways by which<br>people have proposed that climate change<br>will influence productivity or late<br>productivity the first hypothesis is<br>clim climate warming will increase Lake<br>productivity the temperature just due to<br>the temperature dependence of primary<br>production for example that we would<br>expect to see an increase in<br>productivity as temperature goes up and<br>we would even more specifically expect<br>to see more cyanobacterial blooms or<br>harmful alab blooms um papered by Pearl<br>whisman at all pear whisman 2009 should<br>look at the thermal performance curves<br>of different types of phytoplankton and<br>the two thermal performance curves that<br>top out here um at you know over 20 you<br>know 20 to 25° C these are both<br>cyanobacteria so we know that<br>cyanobacteria tend to do better um under<br>warm conditions and so one hypothesis<br>might be as temperatures increase we<br>would expect to see higher productivity<br>um because of that or as a result<br>however a contrary hypothesis might be<br>well it's not just temperature that<br>regulates productivity and harmful aoms<br>for example there's things like<br>nutrients matter right and as we<br>increase our temperature first we if we<br>look at a a curve here um the Blue Line<br>might be historic temperature and a<br>historic nutrient concentration gradient<br>through the water column we know that<br>deep Waters when when a water column is<br>stratified deep Waters tend to have<br>higher nutrient concentrations and if<br>we're extending and strengthening our<br>duration of<br>stratification we would expect to see<br>more depletion in our surface waters of<br>nutrients and higher concentrations in<br>our deep Waters and so perhaps then it's<br>not driven by you know temperature at<br>all um perhaps what we would expect to<br>see in future conditions under warming<br>is more nutrient limitation of s<br>bacteria in our surface waters so what<br>is it should we see increases in harmful<br>agoms Santa bacteria um or should we see<br>decreases um the literature on this is<br>mixed um ho it all published a paper in<br>2019 in nature using remote sensing to<br>look at um Bloom intensity in about 75<br>lakes around the world see if I get that<br>to<br>disappear U uh you can click<br>more and then hide the<br>they showed um in this paper that Peak<br>summertime Bloom intensity had increase<br>in about two-thirds of lakes showing<br>that there's evidence of widespread<br>increases in at least surface blooms C<br>potentially cyanobacterial blooms um in<br>lakes around the world then another<br>paper by Grace Wilkinson published in<br>2020 showed that if we look at<br>distributions of the magnitude severity<br>and duration of sanab bacterial Blooms<br>from about 300 Lakes across the United<br>States that overall if you look at those<br>distributions they're really balanced<br>and overall the magnitude severity and<br>duration the percentages are on the the<br>negative side meaning that overall the<br>magnitude severity and duration of<br>blooms has decreased over time not<br>increased so now we've got two<br>conflicting studies using very different<br>methods and different systems so it's<br>not necessarily a surprise that they're<br>going to um that they're going to<br>conflict with one another but there's<br>not a consistent story here there's not<br>a consistent message of saying you know<br>warming or we're seeing a trend toward<br>increases in productivity increases in<br>alums or the opposite so we went back to<br>our dissolved oxygen data set and said<br>do we have anything to say about this<br>and that sounds like we actually the way<br>I said it is not actually actually how<br>it occurred the reality is we found this<br>really cool phenomena where if we look<br>at the number of lakes where we have<br>increasing versus decreasing surface<br>water temperature Trends and then we<br>look at do Trends right recall that we<br>should expect to see under solubility in<br>our surface waters right as surface<br>waters are warming we should see<br>decreasing dissolve oxygen side and we<br>see that in 224 Lakes out of whatever<br>224 is plus<br>87 the we see the vast majority of them<br>are decreasing in surface water<br>dissolved oxygen as conditions of<br>warming but there's 87 lakes that are<br>increasing in surface water temperature<br>and increasing in dissolved oxygen<br>solubility well that doesn't make sense<br>physics would say that that shouldn't be<br>happening right so that's where we we<br>looked at that and said what else is<br>going on there and so then we extracted<br>those Lakes from our overall population<br>and looked at how they're responding<br>differently and those are the trends the<br>red lines are there are the ones that<br>had this increasing in surface water<br>temperature Trend and increases in<br>surface water dissolved oxygen<br>concentrations so if we look and the<br>blue ones are minus those right all of<br>the 224 other ones obviously the black<br>line was all of them together so we can<br>see they're not really different in<br>terms of warming rates right nothing<br>considerably different is occurring<br>there but in obviously the dissolved<br>oxygen curve is is very different there<br>we can't do the same for deep water<br>dissolved oxygen concentrations because<br>interestingly enough most of those lakes<br>in that that had that red curve there<br>had no Trend in deep water dissolved<br>oxygen concentration because they were<br>consistently in noxic for the entire<br>time period which should sh tell you<br>something about what's driving it um so<br>unpacking this a little bit we put<br>together this three-dimensional<br>relationship between dissolved oxygen<br>water Clarity and temperature recall we<br>were pulling a 400 Lakes from around the<br>world and pulling as many data we could<br>we didn't have a lot of other data to<br>support this but water Clarity is one of<br>those things that we can REM Le s on<br>every Lake and what we find here in<br>general let me do this with the cursor<br>here as temperature increases dissolved<br>oxygen decreases right we see this<br>General curve of downward as temperature<br>increases down this axis right dissolved<br>oxygen concentration tends to go<br>downward until you get to really low<br>water Clarity it's up here right at that<br>point then in the top of that graph<br>temperature as temperature starts to<br>increase the o decreases until you get<br>to a threshold of about 24° C and at<br>above that Threshold at 24 degre C we<br>start to see that positive feedback uh<br>but only when water Clarity is<br>low similarly if we take a plot and look<br>at for the laks that we had data on<br>which is I think 77 laks or so mean<br>chlorophyll concentration and then our<br>deep our dissolved oxygen Trend when<br>temperature is cold so 21 degrees see<br>the Blue Line regardless of Summer<br>productivity our do Trend was negative<br>when temperatures were moderate 25<br>degrees C there was no Trend in dissol<br>aution and when surface temperatures are<br>warm we see s do Trends increasing over<br>time showing this interplay between what<br>looks like you know measurements or<br>indect proxies of productivity and you<br>know its effect on disolved oxygen and<br>here's indirect evidence of what we<br>think is happening is that as temperatur<br>is warming we're potentially seeing you<br>know favoring cyano bacteria dominance<br>of these systems especially in more<br>productive environments where water<br>Clarity is very low summer chlorophyll<br>concentrations are high and we<br>especially see this at a threshold of<br>about 24 degrees C and above is where<br>we're starting to see evidence in the<br>dissolved auction data of increases in<br>productivity over time now this is in a<br>lot of ways it's very circumstantial and<br>very speculative so we don't talk about<br>it much in paper because we don't have<br>any phytol plant data to talk about<br>what's actually changing here but this<br>is consistent with what we'd expect to<br>see if if we um you with increases in<br>cyanobacterial<br>bloops okay so the dissolved oxygen data<br>set gave us an in to try to start to<br>understand more about cyls more<br>generally um one of our research goals<br>is to forecast future changes in harmful<br>alums but to do that first we really got<br>to understand their causes and so we've<br>been examining for the past couple years<br>what are the right conditions for harm<br>um this is a picture of beautiful Lake<br>Erie that's the city the water supply to<br>the city of Toledo Ohio for example um<br>the drinking water intake was shut down<br>to 400,000 people in 2013 2014 because<br>of very high microsystem concentrations<br>in in the water supply so uh we don't do<br>work in Lake I just think that picture<br>is really impressive so what are the<br>right conditions for harmful alums we<br>tend to think of them as manifestations<br>um that occur when we have high nutrient<br>concentrations we get warm temperatures<br>calm conditions that's when you get a<br>cob bacterial bul but we know it's a lot<br>more complicated than that um and so in<br>high productivity systems yeah that<br>might be accurate but we've also started<br>to see harmful ablums occurring in<br>systems where that are more oligotrophic<br>in nature we we're doing research on<br>skinny Atlas Lake in this is one of the<br>Finger Lakes in Western New York it's<br>also a drinking water supply to the city<br>of Syracuse so it's about 200,000 people<br>depend depend on the drinking water uh<br>that comes directly from this<br>Lake in 2018 so this had the lake had<br>its first ever recorded toxic cyano<br>blums in 2017 and so we deployed sensors<br>in 2018 to try to understand what was<br>driving uh these harmful alms here um we<br>deployed a vertical profiler with uh<br>adcps are acoustic toppler current<br>profilers top and bottom the water<br>column collected you know weather water<br>quality data acoustic that's adcp data<br>and then we calibrated a<br>three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to<br>try to understand how mixing Dynamics<br>during when we had our sensors out there<br>was eight confirmed toxic cyanobacterial<br>blooms in in the lake um<br>and where I'm going to show you we<br>didn't deploy over the deep hole in the<br>lake the deepest spot we deployed right<br>in this Basin and North End of the lake<br>and you can see here where it's a lot<br>deeper further down it's something like<br>210 M deep overall you can see as you<br>move up north of the lake quickly you<br>know there's a shelf here and we're just<br>shallower than a Shelf at about 20<br>meters<br>deep so first if you're not familiar<br>with an internal Sage an internal St is<br>where we get you know the surface waters<br>might be perfectly calm at the surface<br>but you get distinct layers in water<br>colum you know epion and hypon separated<br>by that thermocline and if you get<br>strong persistent winds in One Direction<br>you can have a buildup of epilimnetic<br>waters on one end of the lake which<br>forces the hypomagnetic waters to shift<br>to the other Lake and then when that<br>relaxes when that wind wind lets up you<br>can get waves across that thermocline<br>that Transit down the L length of Lake<br>um and you know you can predict what the<br>theoretical length you know the period<br>of these waves should be based on the um<br>thing as attributes like the uh the<br>bimmetry and L length of the lake anyway<br>that's just an internal s but or<br>description of what it is but I want you<br>to know too you might not expect to see<br>you might not see any evidence at the<br>surface so you're epilimnetic like if<br>you're measuring sensors at only at one<br>meter deep if you've got a buoy there<br>you might never see any evidence of an<br>internal<br>Sage but un fortunately we had our<br>vertical profiler there with our adcp<br>data and we see this is repeating early<br>on in our deployment period uh we see<br>high wind speeds and typically for for<br>this Lake we we saw internal staes when<br>we got above 5 meters per second um down<br>the length of the lake and that set up<br>this internal St and we can see this<br>evidence of it of this very periodicity<br>this increase in cold Waters right<br>because we were sitting at 20 M deep the<br>thermocline depth was about 16<br>anywhere from 12 to 18 M sitting at<br>about 16 M on average and you can see<br>that here this transition between our<br>warm surface waters and our hypomagnetic<br>Waters this seesaw pattern right at our<br>theoretical um period of just under 24<br>hours um that s is moving backward and<br>forward um if we look<br>also in our adcp data we can calculate<br>our velocities northward and Southward<br>in the lake and then the vertical<br>velocities as well and we can see right<br>at about a 24hour period just under a<br>24-hour period the system transitioned<br>from a Southward velocity to net net<br>Southward velocity to a net northward<br>velocity right at the lake Bottom which<br>shows that that wave is coming up and<br>then coming back rocking back and forth<br>right around where the buoy is located<br>and we see saw that consistently many<br>days throughout the summer our<br>calibrated hydrodynamic model also shows<br>this right so we can<br>see uh those waves transition down and<br>so you can see it right here where where<br>it'll hit this will repeat in a second<br>and you can see the wave Transit down<br>the therm across the<br>thermocline of the lake and when our<br>buoy was located right about there and<br>so when that comes down the length of<br>the lake the change in color um tells<br>you the the speed of the of the velocity<br>of the internal wave we can see it crash<br>into the sediments right there right and<br>uh and so we saw that and it was<br>followed really quickly by again the top<br>is our velocity um Southward to<br>northward and we can see that transition<br>but immediately after it transits across<br>there we see this plume of turbidity<br>increase we see it in our turbidity data<br>at the lake Bottom we also see in our<br>back scatter data in the adcps<br>indicating particulates coming out of<br>the sediments and essentially what we um<br>what we um see happening is that that<br>wave go back to the animation here uh<br>when that wave transits down it crashes<br>just like a wave on the beach it crashes<br>into the sediments you don't see any<br>evidence of it at the surface whatsoever<br>but it's crashing into the sediments<br>right there in that 12 to 16 meter layer<br>um around the lake and it's stirring up<br>the sediments and there's very loose<br>flocculent sediments there what's there<br>I'll talk about that more in a minute um<br>anyway we see that each time that<br>internal wave transits through the lake<br>now um we can model Tracer diffusivity<br>and we see the amount of energy imparted<br>into the sediments is actually greatest<br>right around we haveen to get very lucky<br>where we put our vertical profiler um to<br>see that on that North End of the lake<br>where that wave comes in and crashes<br>into the sediments um again that's where<br>our ftic profile was located and if we<br>look at phosphorus concentrations in our<br>sediments they're sub pretty substantial<br>um especially as we decrease in depth<br>and that blue band from about 12 or 10<br>to 10 to 20 Metter is the maximum band<br>at which we saw this this phenomena<br>occurring in a sediment so um so we know<br>that that now that internal St rakes the<br>sediments and mobilizes phosphorus Rich<br>sediments into the hypat it's probably<br>also mobilizing lots of other in the<br>sediments too like inactive Caceria<br>cells um so that's the first sequence<br>that's the first event that we saw the<br>next event that we saw was okay well<br>we've got sediments that are released<br>into the upper water column by this<br>internal wave crashing into the<br>sediments how does that release sediment<br>actually get into our surface waters<br>though how do we mobilize that through<br>the thermal clly for example and there<br>in our adcp data we see langmere<br>circulation we see something<br>specifically called langmere supercells<br>which is langmere circulation occurs<br>when you've got strong persistent winds<br>down the length of the lake you can get<br>these helical coils developed right um<br>that you can get convergent zones that<br>form wind rows on lakes and you'll see<br>them on a windy day in a lot of large a<br>lot of large lakes um where you get a<br>lot of surface um concentration a lot of<br>surface aggregation and when these<br>operate when you get like your<br>circulation at the same time as youve<br>getting an internal wave as that<br>internal wave passes by um and that<br>thermocline dips down dips down deep at<br>the same time that you've got langmar<br>circulation those langmar cells can<br>reach all the way down to the bottom of<br>the lake u meaning to to the where the<br>uh the internal stage depresses the<br>depth or decreases the depth of the<br>thermaline so we can see langar<br>circulation pushing and pulling water up<br>from 16 18 meters deep so that internal<br>Sage mobilized sediments to into the<br>hypolimnion and then we saw L<br>circulation pulling those sediments up<br>to the surface of the water and um we<br>can see this for example in our vertical<br>velocities from our adcp data we can<br>look at a lot of this striping for<br>example and we can see this striping um<br>in our vertical velocities um often<br>times alternate at very high frequency<br>between upward and downward veloc ities<br>what we know now was occurring was that<br>those langar cells were transiting past<br>our adcp and were seeing the combination<br>you know the upward and downward<br>velocity of those lar cells pretty close<br>to one another and if we look at our<br>back scatter concentrations for example<br>we can see it pulling material from the<br>surface of the water down down deep um<br>and I we also see some other interesting<br>things pulling up this vertical line<br>here is just our U our ADCB capturing<br>our vertical profile lower lowering the<br>saw through the water column there okay<br>and there's yeah pull pulling the<br>material off of the surface and we can<br>see the vertical velocity here is<br>consistent from 12 to 18 M deep meaning<br>the entire water column there is<br>circulating moving all upward or all<br>downward um at the same time in<br>consistent fashion so putting these<br>components together what we saw in 2018<br>was that we had a three sequence of<br>events first we had an internal wave<br>disturb the lake B sediments and up weld<br>sediment constituents as I said<br>definitely phosphorus in the sediments<br>and probably a lot of inactive cyob<br>bacterial cells that was followed by<br>strong persistent winds that resulted in<br>Minar circulation that c that circulated<br>that material up to the upper part of<br>the water column and that was if that<br>was followed by what we classically<br>associate with cob bacterial Bloom<br>conditions calm warm days that's when we<br>had cacer BLS that sequence of events<br>happened eight times in 2018 and every<br>single time it was associated with malom<br>there was a lot of days when it was nice<br>and warm and calm but it wasn't preceded<br>by those events beforehand and so we<br>didn't get<br>cyes or we started to get you know um we<br>we started to get S SES and we had SES<br>and then we had<br>Lang mirr cells but then that wasn't<br>followed by C dates and vice versa right<br>we had lots of combinations of one or<br>two of this sequence um but we required<br>if you know that sequence of all three<br>events only happened eight times and<br>resulted in eight blimps so it is again<br>it's circumstantial evidence but we<br>think it's fairly strong and we think it<br>now means we begun developing forecasts<br>around to predict cacal blooms based on<br>this s sequence and we started this all<br>out with um adcp data you know which are<br>these are expensive instruments they<br>generate a lot of data and it can be<br>difficult to handle but now that we've<br>developed this relationship because<br>between wind speed and internal stes and<br>wind speed and Lang mirr circulation for<br>example now we can develop much more<br>parsimonious models based on just wind<br>speed and direction um and to assess<br>when these different hydrologic<br>conditions uh these hydrological<br>phenomena are occurring to better<br>predict bacterial blooms anyway um I<br>don't know why that's out of order the<br>um to summarize the section on harmful a<br>blooms um dissolved oxygen data provide<br>indirect evidence that Alo blooms are<br>increasing in lakes around the world<br>evidence by increasing do concentrations<br>in surface waterers despite reductions<br>in solubility harmful alals in our Lakes<br>at least in an liot Tropic Lake are<br>preceded by a defined sequence of<br>hydrologic or hydrodynamic events that<br>we think facilitate Bloom formation<br>characterizing these processes in real<br>time is now enabling us to better<br>forecast blooms and with the right<br>sensor Network and modeling in place we<br>can predict blooms up to days perhaps<br>weeks in advance it depends on the<br>sequence of events right and so you how<br>well can you predict a warm calm day you<br>know we we're limited by our weather<br>forecasts um but we're developing now a<br>harmful alone forecasts anyway that's it<br>um I want to thank everybody and I want<br>to thank the team behind this there's a<br>lot of people that have contrib of<br>research I could you know I've talked<br>for an hour I've actually done very<br>little of this research it's all been my<br>team and so I want to thank all of them<br>um and all of you for paying attention<br>thank<br>you thank you very much Kevin hey I<br>think we have maybe a few minutes for<br>questions um<br>Julia I good thing have you seen the<br>paper might be really useful for this<br>latest stuff there's one by neelson and<br>Henderson in Alo where they look at an<br>internal s on a sloping lake bed in the<br>lateral basically the lateral protusion<br>of sediment so that check check it out<br>that might be useful for I'll have to<br>look it up I'm not sure yeah yeah where<br>there's another paper kasu and Wells<br>2003 that we've used for a lot of this<br>I'm not familiar with the one you've<br>mentioned yeah so that's might be useful<br>so I have a couple questions my first<br>question is have you looked at the<br>periodicity of so you said that that<br>surface when you've got the Lang<br>circulation you've got the up and down<br>velocities have you like done some time<br>series analysis of that to look at the<br>periodicity and does it match what you<br>would expect from the yeah good question<br>have good suggestion though thank you<br>yeah some of it um the the challenge is<br>the upward and downward depends on where<br>we are relative because those cells are<br>moving across the lake at the same time<br>pass thebly because there were times<br>when we saw what looked like complete<br>upward and then immediately following it<br>seconds later by complete downward we're<br>like how is that possible the entire<br>lake is moving upward and downward and<br>we're like oh we think we're transiting<br>those cells are moving past the adcp you<br>know cone and so we're seeing you know<br>the upward side of that cell and then<br>and then the next cell over the downward<br>side of it so it's difficult like that<br>that time varies quite a bit I think<br>based on the speed and how wide those<br>cells are and then where those cells<br>where in the cell we're looking exactly<br>located sorry I have two questions um<br>first question is more technical one<br>when you say use sensors with the right<br>sensors You can predict aable Bloom are<br>you talking about sensors only in the<br>surface or you talking about sensors<br>throughout the water col yeah this these<br>were vertical profile so these are<br>through the water column and so it's on<br>a winch and it's raising it lower in<br>them so the adcps are inherently they're<br>measuring through the entire water<br>column minus the bottom meter and top<br>meter just to the interferences with the<br>surface and whatnot um but but it's<br>mostly through the entire water column<br>is what we've seen could you do it with<br>less you might I don't think oh I'd have<br>a tough time getting to the mechanism<br>explaining why blooms are but once<br>you've gotten to a mechanism then you<br>might be develop able to develop more<br>parsimonious model based on things like<br>a temperature string and wind speed data<br>and vertical shift as well right um so<br>because I asked that question because of<br>course it's a lot easier to keep um to<br>put sensors on the surface than it is on<br>adcp on the bottom right yeah so okay my<br>next question have you heard of free<br>living in<br>aat no no okay so you have to add one<br>more statement to your<br>one more<br>qualifier so um so look at Lake Zug Zug<br>okay in Switzerland so that's where a<br>lot of this work has been done um on<br>Free Living aquatic anerobic s okay okay<br>so that actually has implication not<br>more than just compromising your<br>statement um I think that actually has<br>statement I mean that has relevance for<br>what how increased duration and perhaps<br>depth of um anoxia Can shift the<br>ecosystem functionality of the lake<br>system because Z is permanently<br>stratified okay right and that's what<br>allows these these anerobic cilas to<br>persist but of course if the trajectory<br>continues many leges will become<br>permanently stratified yeah yeah yeah<br>okay thank you I'll check that out<br>awesome I'm just checking online uh if<br>we have maybe questions from the online<br>uh audience please feel free to uh use<br>microphone or the chat function um maybe<br>yeah maybe one more question from you<br>Julian and yeah<br>online um so so I just look at your your<br>first section have you looked at any of<br>the is it possible to tease out any of<br>the other physical drivers changes in<br>wind speed changes in wind direction and<br>precipitation because that might have<br>might influence presuming what's going<br>on yeah we we tried to do that we tried<br>to look at um and in over different<br>different time and aant time periods as<br>well um we looked at temperature and<br>prip and like I said prip aggregate over<br>different time periods there the prip<br>didn't come up with anything that that<br>looked explanatory wind speed um so<br>we're using GD<br>Direction very well yeah yeah yeah um<br>the wind speed we're using we used ra5<br>gritted climate data and then<br>interpolated to you know for the for the<br>Lakes um I don't trust windspeed to be<br>that for the Lakes so so that you know<br>precept maybe you know especially<br>historic um I do think prip def you know<br>is important and it can be really<br>important it's driving a lot of these<br>changes in a lot of lakes wind speed<br>probably is I'm skeptical that wind<br>speed winds speeed can be important but<br>but um there's been a paper there was<br>like Global stealing paper in 2009 or<br>something like that a show that wind<br>speeds over the terrestrial landscape<br>have slowed for several decades then<br>there's a paper that came out in 2019<br>that showed Oh no now they're<br>recovering and so it's like hey are they<br>increasing I don't think there's a<br>consistent pattern in wind speeds that<br>see that would drive the consistent<br>pattern in oxygen that we would see um<br>but prip absolutely but I think it's far<br>more variable based on the region of<br>what you'd expect to see and then it's I<br>mean it can alter the temperature it can<br>alter the mixing it can deliver a lot of<br>you know nutrients organic matter to it<br>so it can do it based on a lot of<br>different ways and it probably is this<br>interplay between how much prip at what<br>time a year and what's the resonance<br>time of the system and what's in the wed<br>so it's like a gets really complicated<br>really quickly so it was difficult to<br>untangle that um but it probably does<br>explain a lot of the residuals that we<br>see in for Trend so you need to find a<br>couple of like model systems and<br>instrument the cramp out of them yeah<br>yeah yeah and they probably probably are<br>even the systems here is probably like<br>you can yeah you could probably<br>disentangle that in a subset of systems<br>yeah<br>awesome well thanks for the questions I<br>think um we might call it close I think<br>people have to go to other places as<br>well so thank you very much and please<br>join me and thank you Kevin again for<br>the<br>seminar so on behalf of the<br>Environmental Research Institute we'd<br>like to give you a little present kin<br>thank you very much thank you thank you<br>cheers</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
