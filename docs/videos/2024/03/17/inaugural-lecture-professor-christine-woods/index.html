accurate.</p><p>you<br>Chris<br>Woods proudly<br>homegrown born and bred in ockland<br>University of Oakland educated right the<br>way through to her<br>PhD um and I think you've been a<br>colleague here since when since a long<br>time long time give the year give the<br>year cuz you know<br>um PhD 1996 1996 and then straight to to<br>being a colleague um and is started when<br>I was 12 started when you're 12 so isn't<br>that isn't that fantastic and and and<br>that means such a lot I think and there<br>are a lot of people in this room who<br>been on a lot of that Journey with you<br>so um very uh loved and esteemed<br>colleague and a clear Testament that<br>both ockland and this University creates<br>worldclass um professional Stellar<br>academics and wonderful human<br>beings um so Chris has has an<br>interesting uh interdisciplinary and<br>transdisciplinary background um as an<br>academic uh her bachelor's degree is in<br>politics and economics and we have Tony<br>Andreas here who uh taught uh Chris<br>amongst many others uh Masters in<br>economics and her PhD which was about<br>approaching e approaching<br>entrepreneurship through an economic<br>lens exploring the entrepreneurial<br>process of women in R who started a<br>business and if you think about where<br>Chris is now uh this is a person a woman<br>who's followed trajectory uh who's had a<br>clear academic path and vision and uh<br>that's what's Driven her along rather<br>than perhaps the um tradition more<br>traditional uh ways in which academics<br>might measure themselves uh she's<br>followed a trajectory of what she<br>believed was significant and important<br>all the way through to where she is<br>tonight um and Chris earned um the best<br>doctoral thesis award on her completion<br>in<br>2002 uh Chris got bitten by the<br>entrepreneurial bug early on her o she<br>worked as a research manager for an<br>entrepreneurial startup she then acted<br>as entrepreneurial adviser for women in<br>Malawi who owned their own businesses<br>and on return to aroa she set up her own<br>entrepreneurial Enterprise with her<br>sister and I think her sister's here<br>tonight no she's she's actually working<br>for Education overseas right but you but<br>your but you've got family you've got<br>son you've got daughter yeah um and um<br>apart from walking the talk these<br>experiences began a long life passion<br>for entrepreneurial practice and that's<br>seen as her founding and really<br>significant role in the owner manager<br>program in 2001 um and if you talk to<br>people who have and there might be some<br>people in this room who have been a part<br>of the owner manager program who say<br>that that program changed their lives so<br>Chris you know and Chris in that program<br>changed their lives and also um Vision<br>to business um which was associated with<br>the center for Innovation<br>entrepreneurship in 2003 and of course<br>both those programs have gone from<br>strength to strength and are alive and<br>flourishing now uh Chris dedicated 22<br>years of service to the owner manager<br>course as of board member advisory<br>member mentor to many entrepreneurs and<br>owner managers and to this day Chris<br>really does love working with practicing<br>entrepreneurs and in programs that<br>recognize develop and extend them now I<br>think Academia is Shifting to develop<br>that kind of true um integration of<br>industry and Academia but um Chris is a<br>Pioneer and path maker in this because<br>these weren't uh things that were valued<br>or recognized or encouraged and to the<br>same extent um perhaps more in the<br>business school than other parts of the<br>University but certainly not and um when<br>Chris was doing this in the late '90s<br>early 2000s um so Chris's um research<br>and practice-based expertise and<br>experience have built a teaching<br>platform for Chris that is genuinely<br>unparalleled so not surprisingly she's<br>an Innovative passionate teacher who<br>creates energy and EXC excitement in her<br>classroom so she's taught<br>entrepreneurship at all levels including<br>undergrads postgraduates and executive<br>students Chris teachers on the MBA Chris<br>teachers arm Mar entrepreneurship to<br>exceptional evaluation so one of our<br>Superstar teachers um in the business<br>school and also the university so she<br>was awarded her first teaching<br>Excellence award in 2001 followed by<br>three further faculty teaching<br>excellence awards a sustained University<br>of Oakland teaching award in 2017 and<br>then kind of the Pinnacle of achievement<br>um the ARO ARO New Zealand Tory teaching<br>Excellence award for sustained<br>excellence and teaching in 2018 so<br>that's the Pinnacle that's the ultimate<br>tery teaching award um in in the<br>nation um so it will be difficult to<br>overstate the outstanding nature of the<br>set of teaching accomplishments only 10<br>tertiary teachers a year gain a national<br>award so we're in rare<br>company uh one student in a stage fre<br>entrepreneurship course gave her this<br>feedback at the time of the award Chris<br>shows her students that they are forces<br>to be reckoned with a lot of lecturers<br>teach us what theories to learn Chris is<br>one of the very few who helps us<br>actually harness those theories to be<br>able to make the difference that we want<br>to make Chris herself made the following<br>comment I love teaching I love the<br>challenge and opportunity to learn with<br>students and see them grow and succeed<br>to be part of a community of people<br>learning together I also love<br>entrepreneurship you will see that love<br>of Entrepreneurship teaching and working<br>with others<br>tonight um Chris's research so Chris's<br>research interests reflect the above and<br>more with these research interests in<br>the area of women and<br>Entrepreneurship small and medium<br>Enterprises and family business social<br>entrepreneurship M entrepreneurship and<br>Entrepreneurship education<br>um Chris has over 60 research<br>Publications and many of these research<br>Publications Pioneer Research into women<br>and Entrepreneurship and Mar<br>entrepreneurship and those are two<br>subject areas you know Chris isn't uh<br>you know a Johnny come lately or someone<br>who's new to this um these are passions<br>that Chris has pursued you know over the<br>trajectory um of her um academic career<br>and so she's notably inspired students<br>to study with her at Master's level and<br>PhD level so many of those students are<br>themselves now leading entrepreneurship<br>researchers both here and abroad and<br>some of them are probably here<br>tonight um so Chris has spoken about her<br>love of research and belief that<br>research should be relevant and<br>actionable in this way she says I really<br>love the research side of things<br>translating research to enable others to<br>have Frameworks at their disposal is<br>like offering a toolbox in that toolbox<br>there are Frameworks and ways of<br>thinking because you never know what's<br>going to be required or for the problem<br>or opportunity you're facing so that's a<br>it's a real form of empowerment isn't it<br>um now finally um there's more Chris<br>Chris really is a treasured and valued<br>colleague at the University and in this<br>business school um and also within the<br>department Management International<br>Business um she's had numerous roles um<br>through her career but I'll mention just<br>two here um Deputy head of Department um<br>to Management International Business and<br>also uh at a faculty<br>our foundational associate de of equity<br>diversity and inclusion um in both those<br>roles Chris has remembered and valued<br>for her unstinting support and care of<br>colleagues her door open and coffee chat<br>willingness to connect with her<br>colleagues her great professionalism and<br>collegiality and her calm usually cope<br>with everything<br>manner that make her a preferred<br>Confidant advisor and friend to so many<br>of us and of course one of the memorable<br>little eer Ms that Chris uses which you<br>know kind of is great most of the time<br>is um um ask forgiveness not<br>permission um so few would be known um<br>as trusted as trusted generous and<br>empathetic as Chris and the fact that<br>everyone's here tonight is Testament to<br>this um so Chris was appointed as the<br>inaugural holder of the Theresa gating<br>chair for women and Entrepreneurship in<br>2021 and of course Teresa welcome um<br>welcome here tonight um she's already<br>established the ITA Center for<br>enterprising women to create<br>opportunities particularly for postdoc<br>and PhD research the center recently won<br>the bid to host the Diana International<br>research con uh conference um and impack<br>Day in 2025 so that's a big conference<br>that um is being brought to New Zealand<br>atra um in this role Chris is already a<br>hive of activity walking the<br>entrepreneurial walk uh weaving research<br>teaching and practice because Chris<br>really epitomizes the enterprising woman<br>along of course with its founder Theresa<br>getting herself and everything she<br>undertakes so ladies and gentlemen<br>Professor Chris<br>Woods I feel like saying that's<br>it thank you very much for coming along<br>let's have some<br>wine<br>Louisa<br>Campbell<br>Woods<br>k<br>I had to put that up because there was<br>no way I was going to remember the whole<br>thing I do I do remember it when I'm<br>practicing it myself um but um I just<br>want to give a special thanks to hon um<br>both for his opening cut here and also<br>for helping me with that um and thank<br>you very much um Susan that was a really<br>wonderful um yeah there there's a few<br>things I've forgotten too so it's really<br>good that um Susan went over it now in<br>kind of starting to organized this at<br>the end of last year there were two<br>people two women's diaries that I needed<br>to check to make sure that they could<br>make it<br>Teresa I'm the inaugural Teresa getting<br>chair so without Teresa I would not be<br>here um Teresa's success and<br>contribution as a businesswoman as an<br>entrepreneur as a philanthropist is<br>second to none in R and I am very<br>grateful for her generosity both in<br>terms of the money but more importantly<br>the time and support So K thank you<br>Teresa and this is not necessarily in<br>order of importance because the second<br>person is my mom Pamela um and you may<br>think that maybe my mom's diary is a<br>little less busy to than Teresa's but<br>don't bet on it um so I I really<br>wonderful to have mama here and needless<br>to say without Mom I wouldn't be here<br>either now there are a few people in the<br>audience that are also going I think<br>there's a third woman in the room that<br>is quite important and that I should<br>have checked in with um and that is that<br>is my wife Kim so I have chosen this<br>particular photo for for a reason um but<br>the key thing with Kim is that I don't<br>need to tell her the time and dates<br>because I know she will always be there<br>for me<br>so this photo was chosen because for<br>some of you you may recognize that it's<br>from Big Bang Theory and uh Big Bang<br>Theory is probably one of the ways Kim<br>thinks that a university Works um<br>because we're quite a strange bunch here<br>at this University and indeed at any<br>Universities so trying to get across<br>what I do is a little challenging now<br>for some of us when we get promoted from<br>senior lecturer under the bar to senior<br>lecturer Over the Bar and we're quite<br>excited to be a slob or a slab and there<br>is nobody outside of the University that<br>understands that or why you're so<br>excited to become an associate professor<br>cuz surely you should be a professor but<br>I as Susan said I love my job so I will<br>often go home and I will just look just<br>be so super excited about what I do and<br>um I can talk I can really talk and so I<br>will be talking to Kim and then I will<br>remember to say hey darling how was your<br>day and and Kim goes I brought life into<br>the<br>world so my wife is a midwife and next<br>to saving life it really puts me in my<br>place in a really really good way so<br>wonderful of course to have Kim here and<br>my two children oh sorry our two<br>children I should say um and this photo<br>has been approved because when you've<br>got a 17year old and a 14 year-old you<br>really need to make sure that you've got<br>the approval so I am really grateful<br>that both azy and have come along and I<br>also have other members of my um family<br>here so it's really wonderful to have<br>that<br>support So Lish ship mentoring and<br>paying it forward why is that the focus<br>um these are really important things to<br>me and I think this is probably I I<br>would hesit to say the only inaugural<br>lecture where the practice run was at<br>the bird cage T Pub um because it was in<br>raising the bar last um last year um and<br>I was i' I've kind of written something<br>for uni news and I was going to try and<br>remember it and I thought ah no buer<br>that I may as well just put it up on the<br>up on the screen um so why are these<br>things important while significant<br>challenges face entrepreneurial women in<br>Aro New Zealand three concepts allyship<br>mentoring paying it forward offer<br>effective strategies for building gender<br>inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystems so<br>that notion of entrepreneurial<br>ecosystems is really important these<br>interconnected concept steps form the<br>backbone of my work that focuses on<br>unlocking and amplifying allyship<br>mentoring paying it forward amplifying I<br>thought that was quite okay the<br>entrepreneurial potential through<br>research teaching and engagement to<br>break down barriers and biases and in<br>thinking about what to say this evening<br>I am reminded of this that I am<br>sure most of you are aware of um<br>kak faka I walk backwards into the past<br>with my eyes fixed uh backwards into the<br>future with my eyes fixed on on my past<br>that's why I write it<br>up and so I'd like to begin with two<br>stories and Susan's kind of touched on<br>those um the first one starts in Malo<br>and the and there you go I've got<br>slightly longer here um and the photo<br>wasn't chosen because it was next to a<br>Bottle Store um but I was really<br>fortunate to go down to Malo um and<br>spent a couple of years there I had<br>finished my masters here undergraduate<br>Masters here as Susan said I worked in<br>London as an investment analyst for a<br>number of years and was ready to to look<br>to for something different um and uh<br>when I phoned up a couple of people that<br>had also worked in Malawi with vso they<br>said Malo was the warmart of Africa and<br>that it was Africa for beginners and so<br>the Africa for beginners really struck<br>me and it was great I really really<br>loved it and I got the the the pleasure<br>of meeting women like Mrs choan so Mrs<br>choan was an entrepreneur per Excellence<br>she already had um poultry she had a<br>number of knitting machines she had<br>sewing machines she had a lot of people<br>working for her and she wanted some<br>piglets so one day with the driver so I<br>was working with a counterpart and you<br>have a driver and so with the driver we<br>drove from the long way down to Blantyre<br>and that was a fair trick um so we got<br>down we pick up these two little um two<br>little pig P um piglets and we're in<br>kind of a hatchback car by the time we<br>get back to L long way and we're really<br>you know we're kind of heading out kind<br>of here to deliver the piglets um the<br>drivers won't drive after dck so hey<br>look I I've driven I can drive after dck<br>so I am driving and in the rear Vision<br>mirror all I can see is four piglet ears<br>and two snouts<br>and my dad was a farmer he was a grower<br>and a Dairy Farmer and he absolutely<br>encouraged me to do my masters but I<br>thought it was quite ironic here I am<br>driving halfway around the world with<br>these and the key thing I'm doing is<br>delivering piglets but those piglets<br>would make a difference that'd make a<br>difference for that entrepreneur and for<br>that community so that was a real lesson<br>so I had a fantastic time met my wife<br>there came back and uh the person that I<br>wanted to go and talk to was Tony so<br>Tony um along with um Susan and Su<br>lawrenson they were teachers that I had<br>an undergraduate and and my masters and<br>you heard entrepreneurship maybe once<br>stage one first week land labor Capital<br>entrepreneurship um and I went back and<br>had a conversation with Tony and I<br>remember sitting in his office we were<br>over in commus a and next thing I come<br>out and I'm enrolling in a PhD<br>um and I was so fortunate to have Tony<br>as my PhD supervisor he was my master<br>super supervisor my PhD supervisor um<br>could not ask for anybody better and<br>it's who I try and model myself on as a<br>supervisor although not necessarily that<br>successfully sometimes but the thing I<br>was looking for a photo and also um this<br>quote came up when I found the photo and<br>I realized exactly why Tony and I<br>connected when he aled about cool heads<br>and warm Hearts as the Lost Art of<br>economics and a cool head and a warm<br>heart that is absolutely um Tony so<br>fantastic role model now the second<br>story is a little bit um closer to home<br>and it starts on the owner manager<br>program um 56 which was a couple of<br>years ago Manu um he is the founder and<br>owner of far north um Road limited now<br>Manu I was working on a program just<br>been announced as the in<br>Teresa getting chair and Liz who's here<br>somewhere she was working on the program<br>with me and she made the announcement<br>and it was really cool and he came up to<br>me and he said um look there's a young<br>woman that I know she's just starting<br>this business called neocate um and<br>construction roading so Mal dominated<br>maybe it might be good to have a bit of<br>a conversation um with her so next thing<br>I have a conversation and Zena is in<br>speaking to the MBA women and<br>Entrepreneurship course for me not only<br>that after that course then there's the<br>case project and the case project was in<br>Singapore and they were looking for case<br>companies and zarena very generously<br>offered to be one of the case companies<br>you can see Matt kind of vaguely in the<br>background now zarena has just gone<br>through a very successful fund raise<br>which I'm allowed to share um because<br>it's not public knowledge um but a<br>series a fundraise and the lead investor<br>is from Singapore and you can ask Serena<br>because Serena's here you can ask her<br>afterwards one of the key things one of<br>the documents she took into to a lot of<br>those negotiations was the report that<br>the mbas did you know which is torn and<br>um successfully you know first series a<br>fund rais Singapore lead investor of for<br>us so pretty awesome so that to me<br>speaks about what our EOS system is you<br>have Manu as an ally you have theena<br>coming in I work with theena every month<br>so I like to think I'm doing a bit of<br>mentoring but really I'm learning a hell<br>of a lot more than um what Serena is but<br>then coming back and and paying it<br>forward and giving back and actually<br>Serena came in at 4:00 because I had a<br>class that I was teaching and I really<br>wasn't up to giving another lecture you<br>guys are getting the whole thing um and<br>Zena came in and and spoke so before I<br>go any further also just say because I<br>appreciate a number of you aren't kind<br>of as passionate about entrepreneurship<br>as I am so the way I think about<br>entrepreneurship and truly I could spend<br>three hours just going through<br>definitions on entrepreneurship but I'm<br>not going to this is the definition I've<br>come to it's about realizing<br>opportunities for change through trading<br>and or innovating and it speaks to<br>everything um that we do so again as I<br>come in to have this conversation and we<br>kick off with this thought about okay so<br>as I go through each of these thinking<br>about so what is allyship well allyship<br>it's a verb it's about the doing of it<br>and I have been very very fortunate and<br>what I have learned about allyship is<br>about being an ally for Mai as someone<br>who is non-mi so here is a wonderful<br>wonderful<br>um um and talk about just an amazing<br>presence and in about 2004 2005 he was<br>um leading off the postgraduate diploma<br>in M business and he came along and<br>knocked on the door and said um I think<br>it would be good if you you know could<br>teach the MDI entrepreneurship paper I'm<br>like well I know quite a bit about<br>entrepreneurship because you know I've<br>got my PhD but I don't really know that<br>much about maldi<br>entrepreneurship um and he just backed<br>me you know he just believed that this<br>is what I could do and you know those<br>pivotal times when you say yes to<br>something and I've been fortunate to<br>have a number of those and saying yes to<br>Mona was a pivotal pivotal moment so I<br>needed to try and find some way of<br>engaging in this MTI entrepreneurship<br>space and I was very fortunate to meet<br>Josie Keelan at a conference because the<br>one thing you can't do is take a little<br>bit of Entrepreneurship and just try and<br>add Mali to it you have to start with to<br>Maly at the Center and Josie was working<br>on this idea of Maui<br>preneur and so if you think about Maui<br>as a poy as a as a youngster as a<br>trickster as a as an entrepreneur and as<br>an innovator I mean Maui changed the net<br>from being round to being Square so that<br>the sun couldn't move through so if we<br>started at that point that gave so much<br>to kind of think about and work with and<br>I would have Josie come into the class<br>um and she was really amazing and so I<br>um set an essay about that um I also<br>wrote a paper and the paper is kind of<br>based around this beautiful pamu that<br>Kim gifted me when I got my PhD and you<br>kind of think about these three baskets<br>of knowledge well the way I thought<br>about it was what do we do to<br>acknowledge where these mildy students<br>are coming in from also use it on the<br>owner manager program so where are they<br>coming and where am I coming from and if<br>we acknowledge that if we play around<br>and adapt it then we're all going to<br>move forward with a little bit of<br>alliteration you know acknowledge adapt<br>and Advance um and that journal article<br>I think in my Publications is pretty<br>much the only one that I've saw authored<br>and I'm really proud of that because it<br>speaks to that<br>experience but then at the same time in<br>setting an essay um and I for those of<br>us that Mark says you know you start<br>making an essay and you go this is an a<br>I think this might be an A+ and when<br>Paul tsel was writing it this was oh<br>this is an<br>article um so Dr Paul tapsel Professor<br>Paul tapsel um Paul an amazing um<br>colleague and he was in the class um he<br>was working as um up at the Museum and<br>so we subsequently developed and built<br>on this idea of takari a double spiral<br>um where the learning happens in the<br>space in between you know with teacher<br>student Mari<br>where we come together with that and I<br>started with this notion of Po and Paul<br>challenged in that original essay and<br>then in subsequent papers that we wrote<br>that we also need to think not just of<br>poi and katwa but also of R and toonga<br>and so we've got a number of<br>Publications there are are a couple of<br>them up there and was also really<br>fortunate um to become a recipient of a<br>maen and this is another point in an<br>academic career when you go home and you<br>go guess what I got a maren and Kim goes<br>you got a maren okay and I go yeah it's<br>really good she goes yeah I go and we've<br>got this much money and she goes is that<br>yours no so so and and then as a lot of<br>family and people do well you're pleased<br>I'm really pleased for you ding that's<br>really good um so we had a a wonderful<br>man process that we've continued um<br>we've continued working on at the same<br>time one of the assignments that I still<br>set in any of the um entrepreneurship<br>courses that I do is to develop an idea<br>and then adventure and so from that<br>emerged moldy Maps now again this was<br>quite a while ago and so the map was<br>going to be a map book anybody in here<br>remember what paper map books were oh<br>that's so quaint now um but this is now<br>online so we have GPS located and<br>photographed every tribal<br>and R with with more information about<br>it it's used extensively by schools by<br>prisons and something to 30 to 40,000<br>visits every month so I'm really proud<br>of the work I've done as being one of<br>the founding directors and still a<br>director um on this um particular M<br>Enterprise so this is an example of what<br>you'll find VIA um and that's down on<br>the cap that's KY Dells um marai which<br>um R and I were down at couple of um<br>couple of years ago um so that's been<br>something that I've I've really enjoyed<br>working on and then another mden and by<br>this stage Kim knew exactly what to say<br>yay darling well done no money for you<br>but it's a ma um and this one speaks to<br>something slightly<br>different which is having done that work<br>as an<br>ally you know and and one of the things<br>is well what do we do as nonmi to work<br>with other non<br>so that we can learn the trick of<br>standing upright here which comes from a<br>1950s Ellen KERO poem so it's a really<br>interesting way of thinking well how do<br>we stand and I will say thank you to to<br>kuya I was a volunteer on women's refuge<br>in the 1990s and women's Refuge was<br>bicultural very proudly bicultural and I<br>remember having lunch and there was<br>these two ker and they said to me you<br>know you pakha you got to stand up for<br>yourselves your partners you can't be<br>superior you can't be subservient be a<br>partner and I thought that's the best<br>advice i' I've been given around this so<br>what does it mean to be um our partner<br>now I'm really lucky on this that I have<br>an amazing colleague that I work with um<br>Billy lithur she was one of the other<br>pis on this program and our purpose was<br>to hear the stories the stories of<br>success from an appreciative inquiry<br>point of view of partnership and<br>identity from nonm maldi new zealanders<br>would working constructively with Mari<br>um across a range of fields so that we<br>could talk about the trick of standing<br>up right here and our final kind of<br>outcome from that has just been sent off<br>to rage last week um so we've had a<br>number of different things come out from<br>this um and one of the ones that I'm<br>really um really proud of is this<br>particular um paper and it's in the<br>Academy of management learning and<br>education amla is the acronym so excuse<br>me if I use that and it's an AAR<br>Journal okay so at least AAR sounds as<br>though it's got to be quite good but it<br>is an AAR journal and I worked on this<br>with KY and Bridget um and Bridget's in<br>here um and KY was a PhD student that<br>I've worked<br>with she was also a student on the<br>postgraduate diploma multi business her<br>and I have taught on that program<br>together and she's now the academic<br>director of that program and that gives<br>me a a great deal um a great deal of<br>Pride so it was pretty cool to have this<br>and then we get this email so this is a<br>pretty cool email um is on the short<br>list for aml's best paper of 2022 that a<br>spoiler alert we didn't win okay um but<br>we were we were on the short list we<br>were a finalist and again I came home to<br>Kim and I went guess what we're a<br>finalist and Kim goes so what is that<br>and I went well and she goes well it<br>must be kind of like the Oscars and I<br>went but if you think about it it<br>happens once a year there's a number of<br>different categories there are finalists<br>and a winner and you go to a conference<br>so again really proud of that but what<br>I'm even more proud of is that hinu um<br>K's mom who is the most impressive um<br>wah um she and remember this is an<br>American Business Journal beautiful you<br>know notice how many words we took and<br>how many she took um so there<br>isoo Mali in that journal um describing<br>what we did and that article is based on<br>what we did in the classroom calling on<br>Linda toy Smith's decolonizing<br>methodologies and hearing from the<br>voices of the students and how they were<br>engaging as well as doing that learning<br>the trick of standing up right here hope<br>hopefully helping others in terms of<br>what um what they might do so yeah<br>pretty awesome and then there's the RTR<br>Center for enterprising women um and we<br>launched that on the eve of the women's<br>Rugby World Cup and um we had a function<br>here um it was really awesome we had a<br>number of amazing women come in and<br>speak um at the same time I was teaching<br>the MBA and on the NBA was a student<br>whose brother was one of the coaches on<br>The Black Fon sevens so he wrote this<br>fantastic test essay that really got me<br>thinking about Ally ship because he kind<br>of likened sport and then if you think<br>about Wayne<br>Smith one of his key mentors was lorri<br>O'Reilly who was instrumental Lori was a<br>quirky different energetic um<br>extraordinary man who championed women's<br>rugby when many male administrators had<br>no interest in it at all this is in the<br>late<br>1980s and if this is there's there's<br>only one required reading from today and<br>that is just the first section that's on<br>the black ferns because if you think<br>about what it means to be an ally it's<br>about what you do when women aren't in<br>the room and it's about what you do to<br>allow women to go through the door and<br>not try and come through the door at the<br>same time and that slide is for my<br>dad because he'll be watching down and<br>he'll go oh yeah that's a good slide<br>that's a good slide so Lish ship<br>involves men leveraging their positions<br>and resources to amplify women's voices<br>visibility and opportunities it requires<br>a commitment to challenging biases<br>dismantling structural inequalities and<br>fostering environments where women can<br>Thrive and that again is in this the<br>article that will come out in uni news<br>which is kind of because of<br>international women's<br>day so if we think about well what is<br>the work that needs to take place and<br>I'll give credit to Teresa getting and<br>Jenny rud last year who developed the<br>gender investment Gap so for every 100<br>startups the crowns New Zealand Capital<br>Growth Partners invested seven were<br>founded by women compared with 72 by men<br>and 22 of mixed gender ownership and<br>we're going forward with that report<br>working within the center to say okay<br>how can we extend that research and<br>develop it on an annual basis because<br>the key there it's about fixing the<br>system not the woman and often we think<br>we need to fix women my colleague<br>Janine's got a great article which is<br>like you know why can't a woman be more<br>like a man well why can't we fix the<br>system so that we can all um<br>Excel so that was elip mentoring I think<br>this is a great slide around what<br>mentoring involves improving developing<br>training motivating coaching and<br>inspiring so for me there's been so many<br>instances of where I've been fortunate<br>in terms of having mentors as well as<br>providing um all of those different<br>things so if we think about the newal<br>economy we often think about New Zealand<br>as a country of small businesses it's<br>not as a country of micro businesses<br>400,000 employ no<br>one so there's the small between the six<br>to the 50 or the six to the 100 and<br>that's kind of what we do in the ice<br>house that's where we're really focused<br>on what can we do to enable those<br>businesses um to grow and so in the<br>owner management you know owner manager<br>program and the University of Oakland<br>business school as a key you know as a<br>Cornerstone partner and I know Jeff<br>Witcher and Barry Spicer are here<br>tonight and those two men were<br>instrumental in enabling the ice house<br>to be established and supporting the ice<br>house and supporting me as an academic<br>and de Shepherd um and D C to go in and<br>engage in that space and been there for<br>for quite a long time um so that's the<br>very last program there um and um ra<br>Goodwin who's in that um particular<br>slide she was an employee of the<br>university and then subsequently went<br>across and has worked um with the ice<br>house and we had two Publications and<br>again talking about translating and so<br>the best compliment I ever got for a<br>book that I wrote was from one owner<br>manager who said oh couldn't sleep on<br>Friday night I opened the book and I<br>just kept reading now these are not<br>people that have kind of where that's<br>there that's their happy space so I am<br>very grateful to David Irving um who<br>again was instrumental in founding the<br>ice house um to Deb shepher and D C who<br>have been amazing friends and colleagues<br>in the work that we've done in that<br>space um and then if we think well you<br>know looking at these stats 38% of these<br>businesses are owned by women but that's<br>not quite the case when we think about<br>those businesses that employ that 6 to<br>100 um so this is work that we did with<br>nzte um so if you've got about<br>55,000 businesses of those 555,000 only<br>28% are led by women and then if you<br>look at those exporting firms only 15%<br>so what can we do to support and grow<br>those numbers so we um this report is<br>available on the website it's around<br>igniting capabilities of women export um<br>entrepreneurs and and you won't be<br>surprised<br>by the things that um emerge from that<br>research so women lack networks with um<br>experience they don't get adequate<br>funding or it's really challenging and<br>then there's the gendered cultural<br>expectations um confidence and time so<br>if you think about that idea of you know<br>the cultural challenges you know I I<br>kind of hearken liken that to you know<br>isn't he a great dad babysitting as kids<br>you can't babysit your own kids um as my<br>sister so wisely said to me once um so<br>what are those expectations that we that<br>we have and and I guess I thought 20<br>years ago we wouldn't be putting a slide<br>like this up here um and I think Theresa<br>probably thought that but when she<br>realized that wasn't the case then<br>that's where you come forward to<br>actually do something um about it so<br>we're continuing this research which<br>which looks into things like social<br>capital and cultural capital Capital<br>because all research you know most of<br>the research I've seen comes down to<br>these three things with regard to what<br>we can do provide greater family um care<br>support for women entrepreneurs<br>increased funding um but making<br>entrepreneurship more accessible for<br>women and increasing support locally<br>through relatable and accessible mentors<br>and networks so the research that's in<br>progress with the center we are<br>incredibly fortunate to have professor<br>anderon as our Adjunct professor within<br>the center an is a woman of immense<br>Manor in the gender and Entrepreneurship<br>space globally she has the manor that in<br>that space that I do not have and she is<br>an amazing mentor and we are incredibly<br>fortunate to have her here and I'm very<br>very fortunate to work with my colleague<br>um and friend Janine swell Janine has a<br>background in gender and<br>Entrepreneurship and has again fantastic<br>networks that we can draw on and I love<br>the fact that coralus is an illustrative<br>example in this because it's about<br>inclusive ecosystems and Teresa is the<br>person that bought coralus previously<br>sheo um to New Zealand um so there's a<br>really nice tie in um there um and here<br>comes Tony<br>again um so there was this call for<br>papers thank goodness they pushed it out<br>till the end of June and so I kind of<br>emailed Tony and Tony like always<br>emailed me back quite quickly to said<br>and said he'd be Keen to work with and<br>support me<br>um on this really good progress in<br>January and pretty much nothing in<br>February so Tony was just kind of asking<br>I said no no come March I'll be on to it<br>I'll be on to it so I'm really looking<br>forward to going back into some of the<br>work I did in my PhD and to draw out<br>what we're doing um today and then other<br>research that I'm engaged in with Billy<br> Christina um really fortunate<br>we've got a um a paper accepted for a<br>journal in June and then also a a<br>thought piece potentially a chapter it's<br>going to be Workshop soon um for the<br>Cambridge companion to women's economic<br>thought so I love the way that I've kind<br>of spiraled forward to where I was um at<br>the beginning um and as Susan said um<br>hosting the Diana conference in 2025 and<br>I have to give a shout out to the Sha<br>Hoy Shin Foundation um for their very<br>generous research support that we've got<br>and to Mark Bentley who's the man that I<br>get a phone call from Mark and Mark goes<br>so you need some more money and I'm like<br>yes I do um so Mark fantastic Ally again<br>um in this<br>space and then the teaching so in event<br>310 women in entrepreneurship I was able<br>to kind of develop that paper last year<br>because of again being the Teresa<br>getting chair um and this is Amanda and<br>Amanda is you have to do an idea an<br>individual idea then you have to do a<br>group project remember multi Maps same<br>principle cycle mates for menting<br>tradies who have limited access to<br>Senator bins on work site the cycle mate<br>is a self-managed senator disposal<br>kit awesome fantastic idea the students<br>together vote on the top three and then<br>again through Teresa's generosity in the<br>class the top three pitch to these<br>amazing two women last year bi and darel<br>vix from Ice House Ventures darel from<br>cie here and for 20<br>$1,500 um in prize money um and can I<br>just say darel was a student in I think<br>it was management 303 many many years<br>ago um and so the students really they<br>were impressive um but then Amanda and<br>Rebecca entered velocity so Vision to<br>business spark velocity they were<br>finalists and then they won um they were<br>one of the kind of the top four or five<br>teams winning $5,000 and now<br>interventure lab so here's something<br>that started in the classroom with<br>support and go through entrepreneurial<br>ecosystem how do we support<br>that um another one to come out is<br>ambition Amplified Holly and Lily their<br>pilot run last year how can we support<br>women in that next chapter we have a<br>great mentoring program that Natalie<br>leads here um for second and third year<br>women but what is there as you move one<br>um kind of one chapter on so I really<br>like that seek guidance in the first<br>chapter out of<br>University and then girls mean business<br>and the photograph on the right you'll<br>see here is Theresa and I think this was<br>about halfast 7 in the morning wasn't it<br>Theresa we wanted to get some PR for<br>running this program so we had half a<br>dozen undergraduate young women work<br>with 50 years seven and eight girls from<br>9 or 10 different intermediate schools<br>around in including hanoa um and they in<br>order to get the pr we needed the PR<br>Company to come in and um we needed uh<br>Teresa to come in so quarter 7 Teresa's<br>there and I just have to say in terms of<br>mentoring that half an hour to an hour<br>that those young women were around you<br>they still talk about it they were so<br>impressed because you gave your time to<br>come in for them and it was absolutely<br>awesome we had some great kids there and<br>just a little shout out to bad Baker so<br>bad that it's good Janice tan second<br>generation owner managed business new<br>Jenis from an owner manager program<br>entrepreneurial ecosystem so that's<br>amazing we've got a new team for this<br>year um first roll out of a program is<br>in Mona intermediate um later on next<br>month so again pretty<br>awesome and mentoring is about community<br>so if I think about the communities<br>that's support me so one is swim 360 so<br>and you'll see that it's 360 coffee so I<br>have bored people endlessly with<br>metaphors of how you can use swimming<br>and stay in your lane and Drafting and<br>following but this is an amazing group<br>of people that I swim with every Tuesday<br>and Thursday it is two hours of the week<br>where I can't talk because I'm too<br>neaked and um I don't have to think cuz<br>Carl does the whole program but one of<br>the real Joys is that I get to spend<br>some time with my best mate Jolie so<br>poor old jeles she's known me since I<br>was 17 we were in uni together and we<br>were an international house and as poor<br>old Joel said she's heard me talk she's<br>heard me talk but the advantage for this<br>evening and I think there's another<br>accountant in the room if you by the way<br>Julie started and has grown a software<br>company with her husband so pretty<br>successful entrepreneur in her own right<br>and I learn heaps from her um but also<br>this counts as professional development<br>if you're an accountant so any<br>accountants in the room this as<br>professional development then the other<br>group is the hanua litery ladies so<br>they've come up from hanua so we have<br>George Sheree Elise and Kim and um you<br>can kind of see there's also another<br>theme you know oh my God we've got to<br>try and organize a meeting when can we<br>get together um and then the glass of<br>bubbly and before you dismiss the hanoa<br>litery ladies how many of you have been<br>in a book club where a New York Times<br>bestselling author Zooms in we have<br>um and please also remember ambition<br>Amplified needing mentors where do you<br>think I went to ask for the mentors and<br>who do you think just said yes yes yes<br>so women in my swim Squad women from the<br>literary ladies now that's Community<br>that's about mentoring pretty<br>impressive then also I come to the<br>university and I am blessed um you know<br>Susan kind of touched on it and if I<br>think about the support across the<br>University of Oakland so there's a<br>number of people in here that were in<br>the 2015 future academic leaders program<br>um and so thank you so much all of you<br>from across all sorts of different<br>faculties for coming in this evening and<br>I have to say I've learned kind of a<br>little bit about how to do an inaugural<br>from watching all of from from watching<br>a number of um a number of yours<br>fantastic support network we still meet<br>once or twice a year for lunch um which<br>is a real reminder that you're in to get<br>that um email out um then there are<br>those in the business school so I<br>mentioned Barry and Jeff right back at<br>the beginning I can remember Barry<br>taking the time to come to my office um<br>often in early in the morning cuz<br>something wasn't quite going right um<br>and he wanted to explain to me and<br>here's the dean I'm a lecturer here's<br>the dean coming down to have an half<br>hour conversation with me I've never<br>forgotten that and that really you know<br>it would have been in about 2 200 2002<br>2003 and it was a very good example of<br>what amazing leadership really is and<br>then I've had some fantastic HDs um<br>Marie Wilson you know she actually got<br>me into MIB um Peter boxal Hugh Wier um<br>Rod mcnorton um Rod writes emails the<br>length that I<br>speak and Rod speaks the link the<br>opposite you know so um a fantastic<br>fantastic colleague um and then Kenneth<br>HED um so Kenneth was pretty<br>instrumental in helping me pull together<br>my application for this um award and we<br>were all on zoom and I get a zoom call<br>from Kenneth to give me some feedback<br>and so Kenneth started because there's a<br>letter on your CV and it's quite<br>convolute and it's like bloody writing<br>another AAR and I just got sick of<br>myself I mean anyway Kenneth comes on<br>and he goes right it's time for some<br>Danish feedback and he said you know<br>what that is and so it's just like<br>straight into what I needed to do so I<br>really appreciate um that support um and<br>then I have to say there's another group<br>of people that are also um pretty key<br>coffee is another kind of thing that I<br>find is really important and um there's<br>Lisa and Andrew and Peter and I shared<br>an office with Peter in 2001 when I came<br>across and best best roommates you could<br>possibly have and has continued to be<br>that for over 20 years and Lisa and<br>Andrew likewise in terms of their<br>guidance particularly around teaching<br>anything that I have achieved in<br>teaching is due um very much to those<br>those<br>three so paying it forward the last part<br>of the evening so what does paying it<br>forward mean and I thought the best way<br>to do it was to talk about three<br>particular amazing women that I've had<br>the pleasure of working with the first<br>is Teresa and whilst Teresa has been<br>amazing in the business world and in the<br>entrepreneurship world this is what<br>really touches my heart and that's the<br>getting Foundation that she founded last<br>year with her sister Angela and I went<br>online and please please go online this<br>is a summary of what they've done in one<br>year one year that to me is the one of<br>the best examples I've seen of what does<br>it mean to pay it forward to take the to<br>take all of the support that you've had<br>from allies and all of the support<br>you've had from mentors and to then pay<br>it forward because that's what it's<br>about so again Teresa<br>just kind of a fantastic example the<br>second one is the wonderful W Mali<br>Rachel um so Rachel just a privilege to<br>work with you Rachel has come in and<br>spoken to my undergraduate class and a<br>postgraduate diploma on on M business<br>and we've got a memorandum of<br>understanding that goes out for 10 years<br>about what does it mean for us to<br>partner K's um one of the co-deputy<br>directors of the center and what is the<br>Mah we're going to do in the space and<br>we've got a Dean scholarship and MTI<br>entrepreneurial leadership and I just<br>had a zoom call the other day and you<br>know when you think oh yeah yeah I think<br>this is going to be the one so I'm<br>really looking forward to that um to<br>that playing out and recently she<br>brought together over<br>250 amazing Maran indigenous um W down<br>in Rotorua and this is a um a panel that<br>I was very fortunate to be on and on my<br>right is Dara Kelly who again is a PhD<br>kind of scholar from here that now works<br>over at Simon Fraser amazing um woman<br>and kitty and kitty set this<br>conversation up about you know the<br>academy and what we do and she said yeah<br>the academy is a colonized yeah we know<br>all of that we know how challenging it<br>can be but let's just push that to one<br>side the academy is a place of<br>resistance it's a place of healing it's<br>a place of learning and it's a place of<br>Sisterhood um so I thought that was a<br>wonderful wonderful thing and I was very<br>privileged to be part of that and then<br>the last example is Anu um and Anu has a<br>social Enterprise operating in Malawi<br>don't you love the way some things come<br>together and again students last year<br>working on a project at in Malawi she's<br>the founder of women together Global and<br>she was a care Award winner last year<br>she's a graduate from our mid school<br>she's a doctor practicing in New York<br>but she has the social Enterprise and<br>you'll note the K there and I asked Anu<br>just last week because I wanted to use<br>these pictures and slides and I wanted<br>to get her permission we incorporated<br>the coru to bring the energy of AR to<br>honor the process of emerging unfilling<br>Harmony to recognize this work with<br>women is an expression of the indigenous<br>nature in all of us to represent a<br>circle of women and their growth as a<br>spiral rather than being linear a<br>process that expands and reaches<br>outwards while nurturing protecting and<br>honoring its<br>core and I think that's a really really<br>nice way of thinking about all of the<br>three things so who am I then in terms<br>of paying it forward and this is one of<br>my favorite um Proverbs a person's gift<br>makes room for them and for me I see<br>myself as a kakore now I know for many<br>of you arore and a kayako means a<br>teacher but I don't quite think of it<br>that way because it can mean to teach<br>and to learn so I see for me a kayako is<br>one who practices learning and when I<br>got my PhD my brother said you know<br>you're doing the two things you love to<br>do most in the world don't you remember<br>my brother is also a Dey farmer and he<br>said said that's to talk and to read<br>it's like his spot on and that has not<br>changed but I like this idea of how we<br>practice learning we enable others to<br>practice learning as well as continuing<br>to learn ourselves or it can be<br>translated as one who likes to wave<br>their hands around um because when I was<br>trying to look for photographs the only<br>ones I could see were me waving um my<br>hands<br>around<br>so to wrap up I have one photograph to<br>wrap up so oh isn't she<br>gorgeous um so this is my Mom and Dad I<br>am so sorry about the glasses mom but<br>it's look they're kind of they will come<br>back into fashion won't they um so this<br>is my mom and dad and my dad passed<br>away 30 years ago um this month and um I<br>really like the age I was then and I'm<br>about I think two and a half I spent<br>most of my days with my dad um if it was<br>time for a nap I slept under a hedge um<br>because Mom was busy with my sister and<br>then subsequently my brother so I have<br>very very fond memories and that's<br>really special because I didn't I you<br>know for 30 years I didn't get the<br>chance to um have that and if I think<br>about the one reason for why I wanted to<br>work with<br>Teresa and Theresa amazing businesswoman<br>amazing entrepreneur absolutely<br>fantastic but it wasn't that and I don't<br>know if you remember back to sitting<br>around the boardroom in room 50501 and<br>Wendy was there and Kenneth was there<br>and Susan was there and and you started<br>talking about your family and you<br>started talking about your sisters and<br>then you talked about your dad and the<br>moment you talked about your dad I knew<br>it was like a sign I knew that this was<br>a woman I wanted to work with because<br>then you're working with your heart as<br>well as your head and so fast forward<br>I'm about nine um I'm the oldest in the<br>family I'm the oldest school and I'm<br>starting to become just a little bit<br>cocky and arrogant at 8 I was okay by<br>the time I hit 9 I was a know at all my<br>dad struggled to read he was probably<br>undiagnosed ays slii I could read I<br>could do meths I could tell the time on<br>an old clock um and so I was thinking I<br>was pretty cool I went to pataho primary<br>school so was a lot of kids there um but<br>I was becoming quite a snotty little kid<br>and I remember getting home from school<br>and my dad was always home he never went<br>to the Cow Shed until we got home off<br>the school bus cuz he wanted to find out<br>how our day had gone and so we'd come in<br>and my dad said so what' you do at<br>school today and I said oh we've got a<br>project on gold and he was then trying<br>to help me and I just I remember<br>distinctly I can see my dad sitting in<br>the kitchen going what would dad know<br>he's a Dairy Farmer I was a little<br>thinking that and I went to bed that<br>night and you know me to Beed relatively<br>early I got up at about half for some<br>reason I was thirsty and I came out into<br>the kitchen and there's my dad at the<br>dining room table with a book I'd never<br>seen my dad read and he's got an<br>encyclopedia now do we remember what<br>encyclopedias were they were Google but<br>in paper and he's sitting there with an<br>encyclopedia it's halfast 9 at night he<br>gets up at 4: half 4 in the morning and<br>I said dad what are you doing and dad<br>said I'm looking up to find what I can<br>find for you about gold and so the<br>lesson for me and this is why it's right<br>at the end is that was my dad's gift<br>that was the learning I got from him is<br>that it's not about having the answer<br>it's<br>about asking questions it's about<br>listening I'm still working on that one<br>um but most of all it's about staying<br>curious so I am so so grateful<br>to my dad and to my mom for everything<br>that they gave me so I pay it forward by<br>doing the work that I do so Nami thank<br>you and the question for you to go away<br>with is Teresa you don't need to think<br>about this question um but don't forget<br>to pay it Ford Cura thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
