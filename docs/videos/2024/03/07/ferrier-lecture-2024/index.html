a very warm<br>welcome to this evening's event the<br>annual faer public lecture um I'm<br>Professor Margaret Highland I'm the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor for research at<br>the heading aoka Victoria University of<br>Wellington um so distinguished guests um<br>we have our our speaker uh Professor<br>field we've got members of the faer<br>family here colleagues Friends of the<br>University Welcome to the university and<br>welcome to this<br>lecture um this lecture is present<br>presented in honor of the late professor<br>Robin frier who pioneered car<br>carbohydrate chemistry in both New<br>Zealand and<br>globally today tea Udu faer Research<br>Institute is has an established<br>reputation in carbohydrate and organic<br>chemistry and staff from the in<br>Institute are connected across various<br>National and international Partners<br>undertaking pioneering research that<br>enables them to make an impact with<br>science and I think that's really<br>important it's about the science but<br>it's about the good that the science<br>does um and it is indeed benefiting that<br>joining us uh or befitting that joining<br>us today maybe benefiting too uh that<br>joining us today for the annual faer<br>lecture is The Honorable Judith Collins<br>the minister of science Innovation and<br>Technologies uh with her remark able and<br>extensive career Minister Collins needs<br>no<br>introduction um besides holding the<br>science Innovation and techn Technology<br>portfolio she holds seven other<br>portfolios um attorney general Minister<br>of Defense Minister for digitizing<br>government Minister responsible for the<br>gcsb minister responsible for the<br>nzis minister for space lead<br>coordination Minister for the<br>government's response to the RO<br>commission's report into the terrorist<br>attack in the Christ Church of mosques<br>so quite an impressive list and um while<br>science Innovation and Technology may<br>not be your largest portfolio Minister<br>I'm sure you'll find that it's going to<br>be the one that brings you the most Joy<br>the most<br>excitement uh and the most<br>satisfaction I'm a little biased um Min<br>Collins is the MP for papakura and she<br>was first elected to Parliament to<br>represent the seat of Cleveland in 2002<br>she holds a bachelor of laws master of<br>laws with honors and a master of<br>Taxation studies from the University of<br>ockland and it's wonderful to have you<br>join us uh today Minister and I invite<br>you to say a few<br>words well tin and good evening<br>everybody it is my pleasure to be here<br>at tonight's lecture in honor of the<br>late professor Robin FY<br>and I would like to acknowled<br>acknowledge Mrs Mary Goodwin and Dr<br>Susan aan who have organized the<br>events um Mr Jack hicker son uh grandson<br>of Robin F fuia uh Mr John Allen<br>Chancellor and Professor Margaret<br>Highland Deputy Vice Chancellor of<br>research before we hear from Professor<br>field I'd like to say a few words on how<br>the government is reforming our Gene<br>technology rules to support our<br>scientists Gene Technologies are driven<br>have driven enormous benefits for New<br>Zealand from making advances in health<br>science and helping combat climate<br>change to lifting agricultural<br>productivity and boosting exports but<br>I'm sure that many of you have also felt<br>frustrated at how our outdated Gene<br>technology legislation has held you back<br>under our current legislation the<br>Environmental Protection agent has<br>approved fewer than 10 GE or GM products<br>for release outside<br>Labs no commercial GE or GM crops have<br>grown in New Zealand and no fresh fresh<br>produce based on Gene Technologies are<br>sold here countries like Australia Japan<br>and the UK have safely embraced Gene<br>technology and the EU is working to<br>liberalize its rules we are being Left<br>Behind putting our climate goals at risk<br>and depriving kiwis of significant<br>advances in health care Environmental<br>Protection and economic<br>growth so what we're doing the<br>government will reform New Zealand's<br>Gene technology rules so that we can<br>give our scientists the tools that they<br>are calling for we will ensure that they<br>are Empower to do their research here<br>instead of hurting them off overseas uh<br>for trials and field testing we are<br>working at PACE to enable greater use of<br>Gene Technologies while ensuring strong<br>protections for human health and the<br>environment and the new rules will be<br>future focused and designed to<br>accommodate advances in gene<br>Technologies and<br>methods they will be based on managing<br>the risks of these Technologies rather<br>than focusing solely solely on the<br>methods of genetic modification like<br>Australia we will introduce a dedicated<br>Gene technology regulator to manage<br>risks so that we can take advantage of<br>the many opportunities that Gene<br>Technologies offer the regulator will<br>oversee the new system it will involve a<br>streamlined approval process to reduce<br>the burden on our scientists and<br>businesses and help them to navigate the<br>approvals process so that they do not<br>get lost in confusing<br>bureaucracy and I'd like to close off by<br>saying this government is committed to<br>getting the most out of New Zealand's<br>world leading science Innovation<br>capability I want to enable the science<br>Innovation and technology system to<br>truly play a role and shaping the<br>prosperous future of new for New Zealand<br>just as it always<br>his this government is committed to<br>reducing the red tape that are slowing<br>down progress and ensure the best<br>settings are in place to turn research<br>Excellence into Global impact thank you<br>for having me uh here tonight and I'm<br>looking forward to hearing from<br>Professor field thank you very<br>much thank you Minister for your for<br>your words and for taking the time to<br>come um along to the lecture today I<br>know it is a sign of the enthusiasm<br>which with youold this portfolio have<br>heard you talk about that and we look<br>forward to working with you to ensure<br>the future of a strong and effective<br>research system um I now pass over to<br>Professor Gary Evans who's the director<br>of the fair research<br>to introduce our<br>speaker uh K thanks Margaret um I'm Gary<br>U it's great to be here tonight it's<br>great to be able to introduce Professor<br>Rob field Minister that was really<br>really interesting as a we we started<br>off as a carbohydrate chemistry team and<br>we've very much moved into the<br>biotechnology space with our researchers<br>like Parker and others uh doing an awful<br>lot in the G modification space u all<br>contained honestly so it's all good<br>stuff but yeah it'll be interesting to<br>see how we can roll some of those te<br>Technologies out into the the field so<br>we're very excited about that I know Rob<br>who's here tonight is head of a<br>biotechnology Institute in Manchester in<br>the UK and he's seen um at firsthand the<br>changes to their regulations seen what's<br>happening in in Europe um now that back<br>out of Europe um you know watching from<br>afar but they're also then back into<br>arising Europe which is a large funer of<br>Science and seeing how some of those<br>other countries are are treating their<br>regulations so um it's just a real<br>pleasure to have Rob here he uh I first<br>met Rob in 1991 which is uh aging both<br>of us but he started off at uh the<br>University of East Anglia in Norwich<br>where he did his degree and then studied<br>uh with alen Haynes for his<br>PhD he then uh left there and went to uh<br>the university Ox where he worked in the<br>penan biotechnology team run by S Jack<br>borwin Professor s Jack borwin better<br>get that one right he was a formidable<br>guy and so he and Rob shared a lab<br>together initially with uh another<br>friend of mine Dr Greg Lynch who's in<br>the audience here somewhere and so um<br>it's just great for the three of us to<br>to get back together again uh we<br>certainly uh had a few barbecues<br>together in the backyard um at our place<br>uh back in the day so it's great to see<br>him here he left um Oxford in about uh I<br>think it was 91 and went up to uh<br>University of Dundee where he worked<br>with uh another sir sir sir Prof sorry<br>Professor Sir Michael Ferguson and uh<br>Steve<br>I think Professor Steve homans and so<br>that was at dunde for a couple of years<br>and adjacent to that if you've ever been<br>to Dundee and I have on a warm uh<br>Summer's evening on a hill at 12 degre<br>CSUS a bit like Wellington to be quite<br>honest 12 degrees Celsius in the middle<br>of summer that's where Rob took us to<br>see the view and so adjacent to that is<br>St Andrews and so Rob moved there into a<br>faculty position and in 1999 became full<br>Professor there he returned uh to his<br>roots uh he's a cornishman but his wife<br>is from uh Norwich uh East Anglia at any<br>rate he returned to the University of<br>East Anglia and uh into a faculty<br>position there and then into the John<br>owners Center I was trying to explain to<br>the minister what what what the John<br>inness was but essentially it's an<br>independent Research Institute<br>specializing in plant and microbial<br>sciences and so uh Rob worked there for<br>a number of years he founded a diag I'm<br>probably getting this slightly out of<br>order he founded his own uh Diagnostics<br>company I se Diagnostics and uh then uh<br>in uh<br>2019 uh became or moved to the<br>University of Manchester maybe it was<br>2020 beginning of 2020 where Rob became<br>the director of the Manchester Institute<br>of biotechnology Mi I I hope that's<br>right so he has um very much been in<br>that role now for through Co um three<br>four years has seen the challenges he<br>talked a little bit about how the<br>University of Manchester are bouncing<br>back in terms of their enrollments what<br>they're seeing in terms of overse<br>students but we're here tonight to<br>listen to what he's interested in I<br>think he started off as a carbohyd<br>chemist and carbohydrates and organic<br>chemistry in general really give you<br>that I don't know fundamental<br>understanding of what molecular Sciences<br>are all about and how they work and and<br>it really gives you a rational way to<br>intervene and investigate and make<br>change uh where appropriate and so he's<br>going to talk a bit about that tonight<br>um I won't chat anymore I'm just going<br>to say Rob would you come up and please<br>give your fa public<br>lecture Minister ladies and gentlemen<br>good evening<br>um it's very great pleasure to be here<br>um I've promised to come visit for 30<br>odd years um I've been waiting for<br>southern hemisphere rugby to die off a<br>little bit to find the right time to<br>visit uh I'm not sure that's going to<br>come in my life time so I decided it was<br>time to come and uh this is a fantastic<br>opportunity for me to come and uh<br>celebrate Robin's career uh and all that<br>he's done for carbohydrate chemistry<br>globally but also the profound impact<br>he's had here in New Zealand uh in<br>particular what I'll do is tell you a<br>little bit about some work that that<br>we've done um I guess like Robin I've<br>meandered between carbohydrates<br>polysaccharides metabolism and biology<br>on one hand and synthetic chemistry on<br>another and what you find over the years<br>is that these things come in and out of<br>phase so Robins early work um with<br>Calvin back in the late 60s in<br>metabolism and polysaccharides Calvin<br>won the Nobel Prize I think in 1960 for<br>chemistry Robin moved on then coming<br>here into to New Zealand and developing<br>a lot of synthetic chemistry but I'm<br>sure the Fier Institute people uh and US<br>globally with the needs for<br>sustainability are going back to<br>polysaccharides as feed stocks we've got<br>to get rid of oil from our supply chains<br>and find some other form of carbon and<br>polysaccharides May well be one of the<br>key answers so carbohydrate chemistry<br>gives you a grounding that allows you to<br>move across a wide range of topics and I<br>today but first of course it's not about<br>me um as with any academic our most<br>important output is the people that we<br>train doesn't matter how many<br>Publications you've got it's the people<br>you train which is your key output<br>because they're the drivers of the<br>economy those are the people that go out<br>and really sell science at all sorts of<br>levels from high school through to other<br>universities to Industry and Beyond and<br>indeed to government I hope so a big<br>thank you to all the people that have<br>worked with me over the years um this is<br>the team as it was in in Norwich um just<br>before covid so um you can see on the<br>far side here not sure I can get the<br>pointer up here but I'll worry<br>about uh David Russell my co conspirator<br>in this an analytical chemist so this is<br>his team my team academically and then<br>our joint team at iini Diagnostics um<br>you'll see where iini comes in along the<br>way and and just for reference here<br>you'll see at the at the top some of the<br>acknowledgements the bbsc the government<br>funding body has been Central to funding<br>some of the work that I've talked about<br>uh they didn't know they'd funded it<br>until we'd done it um and that's the way<br>of Academia I'm afraid sorry Minister<br>that's just life um but but do note that<br>we also got the environment agency the<br>broads drainage board and the pike<br>angling Club as funders of some of our<br>research not easily achievable so I'll<br>come on to why and how that's uh<br>occurred as I work my way through so<br>what I'm going to do is to tell you<br>about two pieces of work which started<br>off completely<br>independently you get to a point in your<br>career where you not necessarily<br>motivated by another academic<br>publication what you really want to do<br>is actually make a<br>difference and there's nothing wrong<br>with academic mic Publications but I<br>think in the modern world that alone is<br>probably not enough we need to be<br>conscious of what we're using public<br>money for and where is the impact and<br>some of that can be commercial and come<br>some of it can be for societal good so<br>two pieces of work one which was we<br>think we know what we're doing we're<br>building on many years of academic<br>science both from ourselves and from<br>others to try and take something in a<br>commercial Direction and the second part<br>of the talk is<br>a Friday afternoon experiment we have no<br>idea what the science basis of the<br>program is we've no idea where it's<br>going to go hopefully I'll convince you<br>that Serendipity and blue skies<br>Discovery is equally important if you<br>want to make an impact so we'll see how<br>that<br>the human body is a lot of water and On<br>A cellc Count basis what you see in<br>front of you is less than 50% human<br>cells right so the surface of the body<br>the skin the lungs the gut are loaded<br>with bacteria and fungi and<br>viruses okay and this is really<br>important because that's a a mixed<br>population which in a healthy individual<br>is very very complex and it's very easy<br>to unbalance it now one of the key<br>features in<br>here is that the surface of all cells<br>are coated in<br>sugars so the first point of contact<br>between a pathogen or a commensal<br>microorganism in the human body is going<br>to be sugar<br>recognition so that gives us<br>opportunities if we look at bacterial or<br>viral<br>infection First Steps binding of sugars<br>very specific sugars on the animal<br>animal or human surf cell<br>surface if we can block those<br>interactions we have a potential way of<br>stopping<br>infection an alternative to antibiotics<br>in the case of bacteria for instance<br>alternatively we can take these sugars<br>and use them as a means of detecting<br>bacteria or<br>viruses so sugars present some<br>interesting opportunities for diagnosis<br>and therapy that have been underexplored<br>years sugars have impact in a much<br>broader sense as well so on the left<br>here you can see the turquoise structure<br>is actually the spike protein from<br>Corona virus covid-19 okay and that's<br>what most biologists will tell you it<br>looks like on the right hand side you<br>can see it lagged in this blue stuff the<br>dark blue stuff that's<br>sugar okay<br>so why is it difficult to get a<br>diagnostic a robust diagnostic why is it<br>difficult to get a robust vaccine<br>against covid the problem here is that<br>the vaccine and the diagnostic need to<br>recognize the<br>protein but there's not much of it<br>actually exposed and it doesn't take<br>many mutations before your antibody<br>based diagnostic is not going to work<br>your vaccine is not going to work so<br>carbohy rates are<br>important and if you ignore them you end<br>up with a very very stilted view of<br>biology okay so DNA codes for RNA codes<br>for protein and that's the central<br>Paradigm on which biology is based<br>doesn't tell you anything about the<br>sugars ignore them at your peril huge<br>intervene now where is that intervention<br>going to be be<br>useful let's have a look<br>at<br>influenza so influenza is one of those<br>where we have issues in the human<br>population it's still a major killer<br>globally on an annual<br>basis and we also have Aven influenza<br>which sweeps through both farmed poultry<br>populations but also wild birds as well<br>and causes<br>Havoc if we take a step back over a<br>flu virus that originated in Birds<br>mutated so that it could jump into<br>humans so it's very risky to<br>differentiate between medicine and<br>agriculture when it comes to infectious<br>diseases because one or two mutations<br>can cause a crossover between<br>species so one of the things we were<br>challeng challenge to do was to come up<br>with a way of detecting and<br>influenza now the infection process for<br>influenza involves two key proteins on<br>the surface of the<br>virus you'll have seen things like this<br>H3N2 is a human virus h5n1 is an Aven<br>virus the H is a hemog glutenin so this<br>is just a binding molecule that allows<br>the virus to bind to the sugars on the<br>surface of the lungs for<br>instance the N is a neuraminidase and<br>this is actually capable of cleaving<br>those sugars so what happens in the<br>infection event is the virus binds to a<br>particular sugar called cyc acid which<br>I'll come to in a moment that binding<br>event allows the virus to get inside the<br>cell it hijacks the host cell Machinery<br>in order to replicate but it can't then<br>Escape because it's still bound to Sugar<br>the neuraminidase Clips in takes off the<br>sugars and the daughter viruses are<br>released so the neuraminidase is a<br>target for Tamiflu it's an amavir alel<br>Tamir the commercial antiviral drugs so<br>those drugs are interesting they don't<br>block infection they don't block<br>replication they block the release of<br>the replicated virus that blocking event<br>the virus is held on to long enough the<br>immune system kicks in and destroys the<br>virus human influenza Aven influenza<br>they both bind this particular sugar<br>unit here called cyc<br>acid but in a slightly different<br>configuration so compositionally these<br>are the same it's just an isomer and the<br>difference between the two isomers is<br>enough to differentiate between a human<br>virus and an Aven virus and that<br>reflects what is prevalent on the<br>tissues<br>in human lungs and the respiratory<br>pathway compared to birds so can we make<br>use of this information to develop a<br>diagnostic I want go through the fine<br>detail here<br>um what we've done is to take this<br>particular sugar for the that the a the<br>human virus binds to we've cuffed it<br>onto gold nanoparticles now gold<br>nanoparticles sounds exotic this is dirt<br>cheap gold chloride reduced with citric<br>acid lemon juice okay this has been done<br>you can find these nanoparticles in<br>stained glass windows going<br>back 8 9 10 centuries it's not rocket<br>science so nanotchnology has been around<br>a lot longer than people appreciate okay<br>so gold nanop particles of a particular<br>size are bright<br>red and what we can show is that with<br>these particles decorated in our sugar<br>we've made these trimic versions because<br>the protein the hemog gluten trimeric so<br>we're trying to get three points of<br>contact at<br>once if we have this suspension of red<br>gold nanoparticles with the sugar on no<br>virus is red if we put in the human Aven<br>sorry the human virus the particles come<br>together the photophysics changes and<br>you get a color<br>change if we add the Aven virus nothing<br>happens because it doesn't recognize the<br>sugar so we can detect and differentiate<br>human Aven influenza with a relatively<br>simp Le<br>system now this is a 3 cm high glass<br>tube that goes into £50,000 worth of<br>spectrometer that sits on a bench not<br>use now three or four years ago I would<br>have at this point had to introduce you<br>to a lateral flow test and what that is<br>uh we'll forgo that one these days right<br>so the bottom line is these gold<br>nanoparticles are exactly what you use<br>in elateral flow test it's just that<br>we're putting sugars on them rather than<br>antibodies and what you can see here uh<br>before anybody calls me out on this one<br>the these are not to scale we don't have<br>abnormally big chickens in the UK all<br>right so if we set up a device with the<br>human sugar sequence on we can detect<br>the human virus but not the Aven virus<br>if we do it the other way around we can<br>detect the Aven virus or not the human<br>virus and the direct to travel is to<br>have a control line a test line for<br>human virus and a test line for Aven<br>virus okay and the human virus should<br>only light up one test line and the Aven<br>virus only lights up the other one and<br>if you're unfortunate enough to have an<br>infection that lights up both you know<br>you've got the risk of a virus that's<br>jumping species and that's when you need<br>to<br>panic okay so this is like any lateral<br>flow test something you can do at home<br>and get early warning it's something<br>that a farmer could use in the yard okay<br>you don't need to take anything off the<br>farm to get an answer out of this it's<br>very very<br>simple all right so brand it all works<br>fortune and probably if I made a fortune<br>I perhaps wouldn't be standing here<br>telling you<br>this so what is what is the challenge<br>where where is the the downside here all<br>right<br>so diagnostics for human influenza one<br>and a half billion a year Market it's<br>heavily regulated as all human<br>Diagnostics are it's a global market and<br>there are a lot of big players in it so<br>we' just set up by sen Diagnostics to<br>try and translate some of this work<br>about 10 years ago now barrier to entry<br>into human Diagnostics is huge what<br>about Aven influenza well actually the<br>Market's much smaller one of the reasons<br>for that is the uh the the department of<br>U fisheries and food in the UK they have<br>what's described as a scorched Earth<br>policy if there's any notion that the<br>farm has Aven influenza they literally<br>take the map put a pin in it draw a 3<br>kilm radius and annihilate all farmed<br>birds in that region you ain't going to<br>make any money out of Diagnostics in<br>that scenario right so the big problem<br>for us in the UK is in fact not the<br>commercial poultry producers it's bird<br>travel across the channel from Europe<br>bringing things with<br>them and we have a lot of hobby farmers<br>in the UK have half a dozen chickens in<br>their<br>backyard that is the problem with Aven<br>influenza that is the biggest<br>undermining factor for the poultry<br>industry in the<br>UK okay so it's not always what you<br>expect but clearly this is a market<br>where there may be scope in in Asia<br>where there's a much higher ratio of uh<br>poultry to uh humans but for a small<br>company in the UK to engage with China<br>is<br>hard one thing we do have in the UK is a<br>substantial race Force industry through<br>New Market and a blood stock industry to<br>go with it and horses also suffer from<br>flu U maybe if you have a horse you knew<br>that I had didn't have a clue to be<br>honest uh there's an Emerging Market<br>here for Diagnostics it's rather<br>unregulated in the vet sector and the<br>barrier to entry is relatively<br>low so we set out to do something for<br>human health and we've ended up in a<br>situation where our route to Market will<br>ultimately support the horse racing and<br>betting<br>industry so you start out with the best<br>of intentions and the science works but<br>you don't know where it's going to take<br>you so we progress we're looking to beta<br>test back in March 2000 everything's in<br>place tests work they're all packaged up<br>internationally and then in swep<br>covid all right so as a small company at<br>that point we're in a situation in the<br>UK where everybody is being told shut<br>down your workplace unless you are<br>directly supporting human health yes you<br>can furly use staff but when you got a<br>limited amount of money in the bank<br>you're going to go bankrupt by doing<br>that so we had a number of options one<br>was F the company and the other was to<br>figure out how we could get back into a<br>medical market so the obvious question<br>is well what is the situation with covid<br>which of course also has to infect and<br>how similar or different is it to<br>influenza in the UK we've experienced<br>more than 180,000 deaths from covid<br>cases are way way in excess of 100<br>million which means that diagnostic<br>tests run at probably approaching a<br>billion test tests now I would say<br>massive numbers huge<br>opportunity will our sugar based tests<br>covid so can we take what we've done<br>with influenza and simply pivot it<br>towards Co instead does it recognize<br>similar or different sugars are we going<br>to get any further in the human Market<br>under a pandemic situation where there's<br>impact so we were in in fact the first<br>lab to show that the covid-19 spike<br>protein is in fact a cyc acid binder and<br>importantly the sugar it binds is just a<br>single sugar unit of cyc acid which is<br>simpler than the ligan for influenza so<br>from a cost of goods a manufacturing<br>perspective this is really important<br>because it becomes Dirt<br>Cheap so the ligans you need to detect<br>covid is in fact related to<br>zamir so produced by biotechnology at<br>tons scale so there isn't a cost of<br>goods issue here to go into this<br>space and importantly the mutants the<br>various mutants the many mutants of<br>covid we've tested 789 now they all bind<br>this sugar so we have a diagnostic test<br>unlike the antibody based tests which<br>don't cross over between the mutants we<br>have resilience built in here so the<br>technology<br>works<br>but when you start to look at the real<br>Financial realities of the situation and<br>you start dealing with regulatory<br>processes and government procurement<br>processes Things become a little<br>sticky so if we look at the equin<br>influenza Market a couple hundred<br>thousand tests a year we can sell them<br>for20 if we were selling them to private<br>individuals they'd pay an awful lot more<br>than2 because they're worried about the<br>their horse having the sniffles right in<br>contrast the government will only pay<br>2250 for a test for<br>you<br>okay so 200,000 tests a year for Ean<br>influenza we can legitimately make<br>around about 2.8 million profit of that<br>to make the same level of profit off a<br>covid test with government procured<br>processes we need 5.6 million<br>devices the government won't even talk<br>to us until we can produce 500,000 tests<br>a day and they want that 5 days a week<br>for three months before they will<br>discuss<br>contracts they will only discuss<br>contracts if we've already secured our<br>supply chain in other words paid for the<br>process so we're in a hole before we go<br>anywhere here and quite a number of<br>Diagnostics companies in the UK have in<br>fact gone to the wall because even if<br>they've got a govern government contract<br>the money hasn't come through quick<br>enough to bail them<br>out<br>so it's been challenging dealing with<br>diagnostics for infectious diseases in<br>the UK to give them their credit the UK<br>government has been spectacularly<br>successful with procurement of mRNA<br>vaccines for covid so they don't always<br>get it<br>wrong but the disconnect between<br>Discovery Science push and Market pull<br>and Regulatory Affairs<br>is a<br>challenge so the science works there's<br>no doubt there's a need but we need to<br>be more joined up at the regulatory<br>level<br>early and we need to understand where<br>the government is coming from in its<br>procurement processes much earlier in<br>the process so you can't dis disconnect<br>the early phase Discovery Science from<br>that route to Market if you really are<br>going to make an impact so there's room<br>for maneuver on both sides the academics<br>need to step in One Direction and<br>government needs to step back in the<br>opposite direction so that the two will<br>meet on a more regular basis I I trust<br>that things are more joined up here than<br>they are in the<br>difficult<br>now we don't all spend our time at work<br>seven days a week right we have a life<br>to live as<br>well so what else goes on out there in<br>the world<br>so this is my long-term collaborator and<br>good friend uh Martin resek as you can<br>angler and this is a piece of work that<br>started in Norwich here in the east of<br>England so this is a very low-lying<br>area most of this region is in fact<br>below sea level and there are extensive<br>waterways here that run to one or two<br>met deep they're in fact not natural<br>water ways they're the result of peak<br>digging in the 11th and 12th century so<br>1 to 2 m deep extremely sensitive to<br>changes in uh the<br>weather on a hot dry summer the water<br>levels drop<br>further you can see this is very close<br>to the Sea the North Sea so there's a<br>lot of salt incursion into these<br>waterways they're in fact brackish not<br>um fresh<br>called make a massive impact on the<br>local<br>economy I can see some of you wondering<br>what on Earth has this got to do with<br>influenza bear with me I will join the<br>loop here all<br>right so very popular with the Anglers<br>and of course there's a big<br>boating um industry holiday Cottages the<br>works so tourism 500 million a year<br>which 100 million is from angling so<br>this is a this is a massive money<br>spinner in the local region and on a<br>good day you know this is absolutely<br>beautiful you you need to be careful<br>about where you're swimming or where<br>your small dog is swimming clearly with<br>around on a bad day it doesn't look so<br>good okay so there's reports going back<br>over A Century of periodic algal blooms<br>and they turn the water this golden<br>color and you end up with mass fish<br>deaths now I knew nothing about this<br>even though I'm a ke angler so my friend<br>Martin comes in to work on a Monday<br>morning oh I was out fishing at the<br>weekend there were dead fish everywhere<br>the Anglers were up in<br>arms um Martin made the big mistake I<br>guess of telling them he was a scientist<br>and the response of course is well<br>you're a scientist you must be able to<br>do something about this so he says to me<br>what are we going to do about it I<br>really haven't got a clue uh I don't<br>really know anything about algae and I<br>have no idea what toxins they produce<br>and at the time I'm working in a plant<br>Sciences Institute and we can get away<br>with starch and we can get away with<br>cell walls but there's no carbohydrate<br>angle here so how on Earth am I going to<br>justify this to my line manager my head<br>of<br>Institute now as it turns out this<br>particular algae golden algae primium<br>par it's a marine organism so you<br>wouldn't expect to see it outside of the<br>oceans but it does come into the<br>brackish Waters in The broads it is in<br>fact a global problem it's a major issue<br>for fish farming in Texas and across<br>China um there was a major<br>2022 hundreds of tons of fish killed now<br>this is several hundred miles from the<br>Baltic okay it was the hottest summer on<br>record and the lowest River levels on<br>record so the water isn't there but the<br>salts running off from agriculture land<br>are so algal blooms are often associated<br>with high nitrate High phosphate typical<br>fertilizers when you've got low Rivers<br>you're in trouble and that's exactly<br>what happened here in Poland in 2022 so<br>major<br>issues there's a need for early warning<br>about blooms there's a need to<br>understand what the toxin is and what on<br>Earth is going on<br>here and how to do something about it<br>now the current mitigation strategy from<br>the environment agency in the UK is<br>we've got fish that are not looking very<br>happy we'll put a net in the water or'll<br>take him out of the water and put him in<br>a tank on a truck drive it down the road<br>and then put them back in the water<br>again that's not funny when you're<br>dealing with several million fish and of<br>course you don't know whether you've<br>exported the problem with you in doing<br>this or whether you've actually moved<br>the fish somewhere where there's a<br>bigger problem than where you started<br>because you've no idea what you're<br>doing<br>science<br>problem the Anglers were so excited that<br>we were doing something they went<br>straight to the papers and told them<br>that we'd got a solution uh we hadn't<br>actually done anything at this point so<br>no pressure need to do something quick<br>and it needs to be obvious and<br>straightforward<br>right and this is Toxin so for the<br>chemist in the audience you'll realize<br>what a beast that is okay for those of<br>you who are not chemists the molecule in<br>the middle here is around about the size<br>of glucose or aspirin or caffeine<br>typical bioactive molecules this is<br>horrendous why a single celled organism<br>would produce anything this complicated<br>it defeats me<br>completely um as far as we know this<br>molecule as is typical for these type of<br>polyethers it's an ion for it SE sticks<br>in the Gill membrane it depolarizes the<br>sodium potassium gradient<br>and that blocks oxygen uptake so the<br>fish essentially<br>suffocate and you can see that while<br>them rolling around on the surface of<br>the water the yelds which are super<br>sensitive to this toxin they're smart<br>they just get out of the water and go<br>across land to get away from the toxin<br>okay Beast of a molecule um how on Earth<br>do I sell this to my head of Institute<br>well at least there are some sugars in<br>here I can might stret in the point a<br>little bit but it it's a bizarre natural<br>product there's lots of functionality in<br>here which actually is really quite<br>challenging quite interesting there's<br>some unusual sugars I won't dwell on<br>that um there are three chlorine atoms<br>in this molecule as well as the chyo<br>polyether system up the middle there are<br>double bonds and triple bonds including<br>this terminal alkine which I should come<br>back to in a moment so there's a lot of<br>functionality here which is either in<br>contemporary drugs or it's used as an<br>intermediate in the production of<br>contemporary drugs but nature makes<br>these molecules in single cell organisms<br>ambient temperature and pressure in<br>water so we'd really love to know how<br>nature does this okay because this is a<br>tool kit that any synthetic medicinal<br>chemist would love to have so I<br>Justified it on that basis and on we<br>went mindful that we've got<br>the Anglers over our shoulder we need to<br>detect terminal alkine again that will<br>come as no surprise to anyone with a<br>chemical background in the audience that<br>solution is therefore click chemistry so<br>this aidoc cumarin is in fact not<br>fluorescent but if you click it onto the<br>terminal alkine with a little bit of<br>copper<br>one the resulting triol is th resent you<br>can see that there were in fact a series<br>of isomeric structures here when we roll<br>this out on<br>TLC so simple test we can confirm the<br>presence of an alkine based natural<br>product alkin are extremely un extremely<br>un uh unusual in nature so we can pretty<br>damn sure that if we've got any<br>fluoresence coming up it's going to be<br>this toxin okay so very simple<br>straightforward chemistry to do<br>that things got a little tricky then<br>when we tried to isolate the algae from<br>the water and grow them in the lab<br>because they would grow fine for a few<br>days you can see the red Trace here and<br>you got a nice golden color and then<br>overnight everything collapsed and<br>everything went colorless and there was<br>there was some paranoia in the lab at<br>the time that somebody was swapping<br>distilled water in uh and playing tricks<br>on us that turned out not to be the case<br>in the end what we did is to take alal<br>cultures at this stage when they're<br>starting to die and ask the question<br>well what's similar or different here<br>so using electron microscopy we can look<br>at the inner workings of the cell and<br>look at all of the bits and pieces in<br>there that are necessary for the normal<br>life cycle of this this organism and we<br>see the bits we expect the<br>chloroplast vacu and nucleus the nuclear<br>en uh envelope and scales on the surface<br>of this particular organism so this is<br>from the culture collection when we do<br>the same then with the algae from the<br>wild it looks it looks wild right<br>there's no nucleus in here it's<br>completely gone the mitochondria are<br>manyfold and much much larger which is<br>generally the sign of stress the<br>giveaway is these icosahedral structures<br>at the bottom<br>now at the time I was sharing a lab with<br>a virologist so it didn't take as long<br>to figure out that this might be virus<br>but it had never occurred to me that<br>viruses infect<br>algae<br>okay fair enough um naive chemists<br>blundering around in biology well we'll<br>just isolate it and we'll sequence its<br>genome as she do gly say these days so<br>we did even though we were told it was<br>really not going to be<br>doable so what I've done here is just to<br>map up viruses for you Rhino virus which<br>causes common cold HIV flu and Ebola so<br>you can see from the physical size here<br>they vary quite a<br>lot and then the bars here only one big<br>bar is the size of the genome the am<br>essentially the amount of DNA the number<br>of genes in these organisms so very very<br>little in the virus because the virus is<br>really infecting and hijacking the host<br>Machinery it doesn't need much it's lean<br>and mean it's not living it can't<br>reproduce<br>independently until we get to the pesum<br>virus which has an absolutely enormous<br>genome it has lots and lots of DNA in<br>it um so the more we dig the more<br>complicated it<br>becomes lots of DNA what does it look<br>like so it appears that while influenza<br>HIV and so on produce about half a dozen<br>different proteins or<br>thereabouts this virus produces 3 32<br>proteins so that's more than some small<br>bacteria which are independent living<br>species right half of those genes encode<br>for proteins that don't look like<br>anything in any other organism known to<br>man so there's a whole raft of biology<br>here that we know nothing<br>about there's nearly 80 proteins<br>involved in DNA biochemistry so that's<br>normally replication the root to living<br>a virus that's got nearly all the<br>Machinery it needs to replicate<br>independently<br>disturbing focusing on what I might know<br>a little bit about carbohydrate biology<br>we can find 14 genes associated with<br>carbohydrate biology I'm not going to go<br>through all the detail but what came out<br>was uh a sequence that's apparently a<br>hemog<br>glutamin and another that's a<br>neuraminidase paranoia kicks in again<br>somebody's contaminated the samples with<br>flu no this is<br>genuine so we've in fact gone on to<br>demonstrate that we don't<br>have a hemog glutenin that<br>recognizes the sugar that influenza<br>recognizes but it does recognize one<br>very similar so there's rather subtle<br>difference replacing an acetamide with<br>an<br>alcohol we've demonstrated that the<br>algae can produce this sugar and attach<br>it to their cell<br>surface so it looks as though what we've<br>got here is potentially<br>a life cycle going on in the water which<br>mimics what goes on in your lungs with<br>influenza completely different classes<br>of biology but common mechanisms of<br>Escape so what we think happens<br>then the Ali probably are not that toxic<br>they produce toxin but they don't<br>release it when they're infected with<br>virus<br>if the cell count of the algae goes up<br>it depletes the nutrients in the water<br>column and you can see that by a<br>dropping the oxygen partial pressure and<br>an increas in the<br>pH that stresses the<br>algae the virus inside senses that<br>stress and thinks right it's time to<br>replicate and get<br>out and in so doing it lies the algae<br>and liberates the<br>toxin so the AL per se are not a problem<br>they're not going to produce enough<br>toxin regularly enough to cause the fish<br>kills it's The<br>Coincidence of the algae and the virus<br>that's the problem so we've Now set up<br>PCR tests that detect both the algae and<br>the virus and that's the positive for<br>you've got a problem so we've got the<br>Diagnostics in<br>place we've Rewritten essentially the<br>textbook for what happens in an alol<br>Bloom and the releasee of toxin so we're<br>feeling really quite pleased with<br>ourselves at this point chemists<br>Meandering through biology and doing<br>things biologist wouldn't do when coming<br>up with really unexpected<br>discoveries<br>but you always have to be careful when<br>you're dealing with your<br>stakeholders because their perception of<br>impact and importance is very different<br>so rooted Again by the expectations of<br>the angling Community what are you going<br>to do about our dead and dying fish<br>we're not really bothered whether<br>there's a virus there or not what are<br>you going to do about dead fish all<br>right now we're working in a national<br>park we can't just throw algicide around<br>we would not get approval to do<br>that so we've got to come up with a<br>smart solution which is simple and<br>world<br>so one thing we've reasoned is that the<br>Water waste often have very low oxygen<br>levels and the way that's dealt with is<br>not to pump in<br>oxygen the environment agency pump in<br>hydrogen peroxide which is a reagent<br>that many in the audience will have<br>experience<br>of it's a strong oxidizing agent and<br>I'll come to that in a moment but in the<br>environment particularly in the presence<br>of iron salts rust and the like it<br>breaks down to water and oxygen so it's<br>essentially traceless at the end of the<br>day it can do some damage but then it<br>disappears on you which is exactly what<br>we need if we're going to do this in a<br>national park right now hydrogen<br>peroxide some of you will have come<br>across in a different sense 7% hydrogen<br>peroxide is hair<br>bleach 3% hydrogen peroxide is teeth<br>whitener you can actually get 3%<br>hydrogen peroxide on Amazon as food<br>grade I'm not sure I'd want to drink it<br>but um so be careful when you whiten<br>your teeth the the environment agency<br>already have the infrastructure to use<br>peroxide in the environment to aate the<br>water so we've worked with them to<br>Simply dial up the concentration of<br>peroxide they're using so that there's a<br>bit more front end damage being caused<br>to kill the Aly so they have all the<br>cheap next set of field Group<br>experiments are out in the wild um<br>signage on the roadway keep path<br>chemical dosing in process so we're no<br>longer in a test tube we're now in<br>several kilometers of Waterway for our<br>reaction vessel okay 50 gallon drums of<br>peroxide and health and safety for that<br>of course means face masks and full<br>suits you can see one of my team here<br>looking rather amused at this this is<br>teeth whitener but this is hazardous<br>material right as far as the Public's<br>concern here you can see it being<br>bubbled in the water and what we've<br>shown with this approach is that we can<br>take out the bloom and as from a<br>chemistry perspective anything with<br>alenes and alkes in it you're putting<br>hydrogen peroxide in there you're going<br>to get rid of the toxin very quickly as<br>well so we can take out not only the<br>algae but also the toxin with the<br>peroxide and peroxide infrastructure<br>that the environment agency would<br>normally use to aate the Waterway it<br>works nonetheless we have to demonstrate<br>that we're not doing any lasting damage<br>so we've had to turn<br>ecologists and count the fish and count<br>the<br>insects um the scum on the water here<br>you can see when you when you take out<br>an alal Bloom you've got a lot of lized<br>algal cells the lipid membranes form a<br>little bit of an emultion on the surface<br>absolutely normal no big deal the<br>biggest problem we had was not the<br>insects nor the fish it was in fact the<br>boats right so this boat was white when<br>we started I must say<br>that so we had to prove to the broads<br>Authority and to the Boatyard owners<br>that putting hydrogen peroxide into the<br>water would not leech the boats so<br>literally plank of wood red paint bucket<br>of<br>peroxide I really struggled to get the<br>director of plant Sciences Institute to<br>pay for<br>that so there are some in the community<br>who were really not worried about the<br>Ecology of the Waterway they really were<br>only worried about the boats nonetheless<br>no damage done all<br>sorted so this is one of those pieces of<br>science where it all worked out there is<br>a societal need and a benefit to be had<br>we have Rewritten the policy and<br>practice with the environment agency<br>it's changed their protocols so at a at<br>a a cerebral level if you will we've<br>changed thinking about what actually<br>goes on in the Ecology of this system<br>but at a practical level we've also got<br>very simple chemistry that can be rolled<br>out on a field basis the Anglers are<br>happy tourist Border<br>happy job done okay so that all works so<br>this is quite the antithesis of what I<br>started out with where there's lots of B<br>basic science and we're trying to take<br>it through the Commerce that's hard here<br>we had no clue where we were going but<br>we've still come up with a practical<br>solution as well as a lot of Discovery<br>Science so I think it's really important<br>that we think about that interplay<br>between<br>Discovery development and application<br>because Innovation is needed in all<br>areas a lot of Discovery Science is very<br>difficult to predict where you're going<br>there is a level of serendipity and my<br>God we need to support that because the<br>applications of 20 years time will be<br>based on the blue sky discovery of<br>today and this is a cycle once you've<br>gone from Discovery through development<br>to application you identify where the<br>shortcomings are and then you need to go<br>back to Discovery but you're not going<br>to turn that Circle Without Really<br>rooting it in engagement with policy and<br>Regulatory approval early so I think<br>it's important that from an academic<br>perspective we think about how are we<br>going to achieve impact and what are the<br>hurdles in the way and the hurdle is<br>generally not the science and most<br>scientists rarely take the steps that<br>will force that issue for them equally<br>it's important for government and I'll<br>say this for UK government it's<br>important to fund Discovery Science and<br>not just application<br>because as I've already said the<br>discovery of today is the application of<br>20 years time and it would be full Hardy<br>to walk away from that and think that<br>you can manage everything through<br>application<br>so a little bit of science a little bit<br>of societal benefit a little bit of<br>Commerce um we've had some fun along the<br>way hopefully I've kept you entertained<br>for a little while I'd be very happy to<br>take any questions and thank thank you<br>listening cool um that was great thanks<br>Rob I I want to know where you would be<br>if you'd made your bonss if you weren't<br>going to be here Rob if you w going to<br>be sat here or stood here where would<br>you be angling somewhere yes Cho maybe<br>um okay we've got time for some<br>questions um Anette and Lawrence have uh<br>microphones if anybody would like to ask<br>a question please raise your hand and<br>they will come to<br>you come on someone must have a<br>question the back up the back here we go<br>thank you that's a simple question you<br>consider<br>Theus we've looked longingly at the<br>Middle East because of the value of<br>their<br>Falcons yeah no no word of a lie on that<br>one you're talking about tens hundreds<br>of thousands of pounds for a flying<br>falcon in the Middle East um we've also<br>family who like to take their horses<br>onto the race course right and the<br>police who do<br>likewise um we're also talking to the<br>Jockey Club in uh Hong Kong and also in<br>Kentucky so there are Global<br>opportunities but you have to spend a<br>lot of time on the road to hit all of<br>these uh opportunities there are many<br>sorry I'll bear that one in mind I'll<br>bear that one in mind all oh k um thanks<br>Rob for a great lecture I really love<br>that kind of combination of the Blue Sky<br>science the you know go to the people<br>who are having the problem I love that<br>you know the angle is kind of going back<br>to you and going great but what are you<br>going to do about it and I think that's<br>so important to engage with that and<br>actually makes our science better<br>because it forces us to think<br>differently so I love that feedback loop<br>um the only thing I was going to ask<br>about you know in terms of your you<br>identified the regulator and the<br>government um I'm an engineer and so I<br>also think about scale up yeah so do you<br>have any comments about how you engage<br>in terms of actually getting it to the<br>to the scale that you need and when does<br>that occur absolutely that's a critical<br>one as well I think that that's why I<br>was so pleased that you know the<br>molecule we needed for covid maps to a m<br>amov which has already been<br>industrialized from a biotechnology<br>perspective one of the major<br>shortcomings still in the UK at the<br>moment is scal up so there is a<br>burgeoning biotech sector but taking<br>things Beyond a couple of liters is hard<br>and making sure that you've got that<br>route from Discovery through to scale<br>quickly is critical uh if you're going<br>to drive the economy with that in place<br>we we see this a lot not so much in the<br>in the Fine Chemicals and and medicines<br>area we're seeing it in the home care<br>products so the unever and the proter<br>and gambl of this world they won't come<br>near us unless we can put you know on<br>the table when we normally work with<br>milligrams and there isn't an easy way<br>to go from where Academia sits to where<br>the big companies sit that's actually<br>driving um the development of Ann sector<br>to serve as that intermediary but you<br>need the infrastructure and it needs to<br>be a national infrastructure not a local<br>one because you need to you know this is<br>expensive infrastructure you need to<br>milk it for all its work so it needs to<br>be coordinated on a national basis I say<br>cool and I have a a question have you<br>considered given that toxin is so unique<br>and challenging structure and the virus<br>that you have has an enormous number of<br>genes unusual for that that in fact<br>there some of those genes are enabling<br>that production of that toxin within<br>that particular<br>microorganism that's an interesting one<br>um so we have started to look at the<br>metabolite profiles in the algae after<br>the virus is infected and we've just<br>looked at Sugar nucleotides because we<br>know how to do that they're all over the<br>place some sugar nucleotides go up by 50<br>fold in concentration and we don't<br>really know why yet um so there's<br>definitely an impact of the virus on<br>metabolism in<br>general um in terms of whether it's<br>contributing to the production of the<br>toxin um we don't think so so there's a<br>paper just come out it's actually not<br>even out it's on bioarchive at the<br>moment from the scripts Institute of<br>oceanography where they've discovered<br>the enzyme the gene for the enzyme that<br>makes that<br>toxin it's one protein and it's in<br>excess of of a mega dalan in size it's<br>bigger than any human<br>protein so it's got something like 65<br>independent catalytic modules on one<br>protein okay and we see this a lot in<br>the algae whereas a back iium would have<br>an operon and it would coexpress a<br>number of genes what we see in the algae<br>is that they've acquired these bacterial<br>capabilities by horizontal transfer and<br>in the act of doing so they Stitch<br>protein the the genes together into a<br>single protein so Al like making<br>polyproteins which makes you know you<br>look at your SDS page gel and it doesn't<br>even get out of the stacking yet so it's<br>quite bizarre so yeah uh I'm going to<br>have to find something easy to work on<br>something<br>Rob we don't know on that one one one of<br>the problems in the algae is that there<br>there are so few genome sequences that<br>we've not were not able to track the<br>genetic lineages back in time easily at<br>the moment um we've started to do it a<br>little bit in relation to this this<br>unusual sugar that's the receptor for<br>the virus so we can track that across<br>different lineages of algae and it's<br>ancient so the production of the algal<br>sugar and the human sugar the animal<br>sugar this is very very old<br>biochemistry um and the Divergence<br>between one and the other it goes back<br>Millennia at<br>least so there's an awful lot more to<br>come on that front yet to try and<br>understand the the relationships between<br>organisms thank you um<br>Robert um I have a question is about<br>Alzheimer<br>disease um is true lifestyle like<br>cutting down alcohol having enough sleep<br>to prevent or you come up with research<br>for medicine to to prevent Alzheimer<br>disease that's a challenge um I think<br>there are lots of new discoveries coming<br>through all the time lots more<br>information about structures of the<br>proteins that cause the problem and<br>mechanisms to remove those proteins a<br>lot of those proteins are not degraded<br>naturally by the human body which is<br>where the problem comes from so as a<br>therapeutic therapeutic approach in<br>general um there's a lot of interest in<br>the viruses that infect bacteria<br>bacteria phages they produce a lot of<br>degradative enzymes so there's a lot of<br>interest in phage therapies not so much<br>in the Alzheimer's area yet but<br>certainly in relation to cancer and in<br>relation to infectious diseases so just<br>to give you a flavor so the human gut<br>has 10 times more viruses than it has<br>bacteria okay you'll have heard of Nora<br>virus for instance but that's just a<br>drop in the ocean so viruses controlling<br>bacterial populations is part of normal<br>homeostasis so not all viruses are bad<br>for<br>you and we're now starting to get to the<br>point where we can cultures viruses in<br>vitro that have the necessary hydratic<br>capabilities to do something<br>therapeutically useful so that's the<br>next generation of therapies coming<br>through I feel that um offers a lot of<br>scope particularly in in a an<br>antimicrobial resistance era where we<br>need something other than just<br>antibiotics last question thank um hi<br>professor Robert so um it will be a very<br>general question so um since last year<br>like Nobel Prize was handed to um<br>chemistry is kind of like related to<br>quantum<br>physics and um<br>so<br>like last year's Nobel Prize was like<br>chemistry and was like related to<br>physics so um my question is like like<br>this lecture is basically about like<br>something that around virus<br>andry actually applied Ino so what will<br>be like the future about like the<br>traditional um like all of these things<br>are actually that related to yeah yeah<br>abely at the end of the day on the right<br>um and biot technology is fantastic and<br>it offers huge opportunities and with<br>all the genome sequencing programs we<br>have loads of new tools loads of new<br>opportunities but if you look at the<br>world's top drugs they've got Florine in<br>them nature doesn't do flourine very<br>well we're never going to walk away from<br>synthetic chemistry there will always be<br>a role for it the power going forward is<br>the integration of synthetic chemistry<br>and synthetic biology to take you places<br>that chemistry can't take you and<br>biology can't take you but the two<br>together is where the power comes for<br>the future I've heard plenty about that<br>today from the people here so I'm sure<br>you're all on the right track brilliant<br>thank you Rob and uh just thank you<br>everybody for coming along we really<br>appreciate it hopefully you had a drink<br>and a nibble and uh I just want to thank<br>all</p></main><footer
