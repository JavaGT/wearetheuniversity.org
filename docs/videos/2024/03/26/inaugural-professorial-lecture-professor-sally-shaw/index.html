opportunity for<br>us to come together and listen to our<br>new professors talk about their personal<br>Journeys their research platform and<br>their the impact that research has had<br>on<br>others I'd like to welcome colleagues<br>students and friends from across the<br>university including those joining us<br>via live<br>stream I would like to give a special<br>welcome to sy's wife Janice<br>Murray as well as other members of s<br>sy's<br>whiteo because I know Sy is an avid<br>golfer I would also like to acknowledge<br>sy's golfing friends attending this<br>evening welcome to you<br>all it's not it's not easy to become a<br>professor at the University of atago in<br>order to be promoted to that level<br>candidates need to show that they are<br>outstanding in each of three categories<br>research teaching and service Sy has<br>clearly met these criteria and it and<br>it's an honor and a privilege to<br>congratulate her tonight for that<br>outstanding<br>achievement Sy is an internationally<br>renowned researcher in the field of<br>sports management most of her<br>Publications are in the area of<br>sexuality and gender relations in sport<br>organ<br>ganizations diversity equality and<br>inclusion in sport management and<br>governance sport volunteer management<br>and qualitative research methods in<br>sport tonight Sy will reflect on her<br>academic career to tell us a little bit<br>about her own personal Journey she will<br>tell us about the positive impact of<br>that of her theoretically informed<br>research on Sports managers she will<br>also tell us a little bit about her<br>teaching and her students but before Sy<br>does that I'll hand over to Professor<br>Richard Barker Pro Vice Chancellor for<br>the division of Sciences to introduce<br>Teno Professor Brock<br>T Professor Shaw<br>associate professor Hargraves tqu<br>Emeritus Professor Murray tqu and can I<br>say congratulations on your recent nuls<br>friends and colleagues Teno Teno Teno<br>it's my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight Professor Sally Shaw<br>from the school of physical education<br>Sport and exercise Sciences to give her<br>inaugural professorial lecture at the<br>University of otago as indicated by<br>Professor Brock Sally was promoted to<br>Professor in February of this year and<br>tonight we get to celebrate this<br>significant<br>achievement Professor Shaw grew up in<br>Edinburgh and she claims that she<br>doesn't have much of a Scottish accent<br>um I'm not so sure about this there's<br>definitely an accent I wouldn't have<br>said glaswegian no no<br>um yeah but yeah definitely an accent<br>she attended St Leonard's School in the<br>beautiful town of St Andrews as a border<br>where she was head girl in her briefing<br>she said could insert a joke here and I<br>couldn't think of one but but I did<br>think that Sally's head girl didn't<br>surprise me and of course St Andrews is<br>the home of golf and she says she must<br>be a slow learner she didn't start<br>playing golf until her late 30s now just<br>compared notes with Sally because I've<br>also taken up Golf and I see the golf is<br>here um and her handicaps 22 Strokes<br>better than mine so I'm looking for a<br>few tips um but I know one of the tips<br>is no profanity and it's golf is really<br>card<br>right Sally obtained a Bachelor of Arts<br>with honors and sociology from the<br>University of York before undertaking<br>her Masters in sports management from<br>Sheffield and then a PhD at dford<br>University the interest in sports<br>management was sparked when she worked<br>for sport England in the mid 1990s and<br>notice that when public money was being<br>poured into the sports sector many of<br>the old implicit gendered cultural norms<br>that have been part and parcel of<br>amateur sport were unquestioningly<br>incorporated into the newly professional<br>era for many women in sports governments<br>who had been running efficient lowbudget<br>women's sports organizations this was a<br>very difficult time thank you for those<br>words<br>Sally on completion of her PhD Professor<br>Shaw took up her first academic<br>appointment as an assistant professor in<br>the department of sport management at<br>Brock University Ontario Canada this<br>lasted just under a year before she<br>decided to cross the Pacific to take up<br>a post at the University of w in 2005 we<br>were successful on attracting Professor<br>Shaw Southwood and she took up the post<br>of lecture in our sport of physical<br>education Sport and exercise science and<br>commenced her um Rising through the<br>academic rankings to achieve the<br>professor of uh excuse me achieve the<br>position of Professor which we celebrate<br>tonight as we have heard from Professor<br>Brock promotion to full professor at the<br>University of otago was far from Easy<br>you must must excel in all academic<br>domains of teaching research and service<br>and Sally has truly<br>excelled she's an internationally<br>acclaimed critical organizational<br>management researcher in the field of<br>sports management and has a strong track<br>record of Publications and sexuality and<br>gender relations and Sport organizations<br>diversity equity and inclusion and Sport<br>management and government sport<br>organizational governance sport<br>volunteer management and Innovative<br>qualitative research methods in sport<br>This research has had real impact<br>Professor Shaw was contracted to support<br>New Zealand Rugby and New Zealand<br>Cricket to improve their inclusion<br>practices and led and implemented the<br>first New Zealand study into<br>anti-homophobia policies with six of our<br>national sport<br>organizations Professor Shaw is also an<br>outstanding teacher and this teaching is<br>noted for its Innovation and Leadership<br>the school recently went through a major<br>curriculum overhaul and as part of this<br>professor Shaw Le the design of the<br>postgraduate program in the school as<br>well as developing new curriculum<br>content in the area of sport development<br>and<br>management this leadership and teaching<br>extends beyond the school and as<br>associate Dean postgraduate for the<br>division of Sciences she led the<br>division's contribution to the C the<br>quality advancement unit review of<br>postgraduate programs and<br>Sciences over the period<br>2016 2020 and this included writing<br>a Hefty divisional self-review document<br>and then following this up with a<br>highquality evaluation of the divisional<br>postgraduate programs following the<br>review<br>recommendations as this example shows<br>Professor Shaw's service to the academic<br>and professional communities has been<br>exemplary and her service to the<br>university stands out for me personally<br>as this has how I've come to know Sally<br>and her considerable talents and can I<br>add<br>forbearance as the inaugural associate<br>Dean postgraduate for the division of<br>Sciences Sally developed the template<br>for what dedicated service in this role<br>looks like she represented the Sciences<br>division on the board of Graduate<br>Studies on The Graduate research and<br>scholarships committee on Senate she<br>chaired three postgraduate admissions<br>committees moderated student grievances<br>investigated academic Integrity<br>cases appeals also that followed some of<br>those conducted by other people and was<br>a member of The Sciences standing<br>committee as well as holding periods as<br>PVC this was all undertaken at a time<br>when the division had to go through some<br>quite significant and difficult<br>restructuring Sally's support through<br>this was immense and for this I want to<br>say thank<br>you I think that's enough from me it's<br>now time to hear from Professor Shaw<br>herself one of our fabulous woman in<br>science here at the O University of<br>otago please join me and welcoming<br>Shaw<br>hands<br>sorry<br>edin a ten Teno<br>ten thank you everyone for coming and<br>thank you for those really um moving<br>words actually Richard I'll almost<br>forgive you for forgetting your tie but<br>um I was lining up my joke of uh who<br>chose your tie and can't do it gutted<br>thanks everyone for coming both golfers<br>and non- golfers alike um it's uh it's a<br>funny old thing I've discovered doing<br>these so here we are and I'll crack on<br>with it and try and get through in<br>plenty of uh time so that we can all go<br>somewhere else thanks for Tha Sebastian<br>much<br>appreciated uh sport sport is a funny<br>old thing it's a place of entertainment<br>it's a place of Joy it's a place of<br>tragedy it's a place of Heartache what I<br>didn't tell Richard of course is my<br>heartbreaking loss in the club Champs on<br>Sunday um and uh for many of us it also<br>offers great Community uh great<br>friendship and uh great passion for many<br>women and for many lgbtq plus people and<br>I apologize for this slide because it's<br>awful but um it's just a quick what do<br>they all mean it can also be a place of<br>marginalization it can be a place of<br>exclusion it can be a place of bullying<br>and it can be a place of gendered and<br>sexualized violence as well as well as<br>all those good things and those are some<br>of the things that I want to uh cover a<br>little bit tonight um yes talking about<br>um how I've got here and and all the<br>rest of it um but also hopefully leaving<br>you um on a bit of an up as well as some<br>of the question marks along the<br>way um it's fair to say that I have<br>always been fairly sporty and although<br>it's true I did not start golf till my<br>mid 30s there is some activity going on<br>with a golf club and a and a ball there<br>I couldn't call it golf myself but um<br>yeah and I was quite cute um to be fair<br>so of you know me better as this version<br>with chin and grit and determination and<br>all those things that I seem to bring to<br>most things um and what you don't know<br>also about that golf photo is I was<br>there was an internal out of bounds in<br>that golf course and I was praying it<br>didn't go in there so um for those you<br>in the<br>know um my life began in Edinburgh<br>Bonnie Scotland um and uh I was brought<br>up in a village um called Bolero just<br>about 8 Miles old school outside of of<br>Edinburgh on the good side for the<br>airport um and like many small Scottish<br>Villages it did a good line in Gray<br>architecture um and but was is a very<br>pretty pretty Village perhaps more<br>interestingly it's the source of the<br>water of Le who knew the other one uh<br>and you can follow the water of leth all<br>the way down to the docks um in<br>Edinburgh um there the landscape photos<br>which I must thank my sister for uh are<br>um of the beginning of the pentland<br>Regional Park pentland Hills are just<br>near where we lived and I was lucky<br>enough as a kid to do a fair bit of<br>messing about there and I think if you<br>squint a bit maybe they're a little bit<br>like the Mong atour I don't know just<br>something in there somewhere that might<br>be a bit of a stretch anyway uh yeah<br>thanks to my big sister who took those<br>at about probably midday On a Winter's<br>day which is um about all the sun you're<br>going to get<br>um the rest of the family so uh my<br>family is made up of my mom up there in<br>the red<br>cardi uh my dad who died when I was<br>about seven um and uh but I've never<br>just had one parent I've always had the<br>love and care also of my Aunt Jane who's<br>there in her um Aunt blouse up there in<br>the top um the the the big picture is is<br>everybody it's my brother John my uh<br>nephews William and uh Freddy Georgia<br>and Jesse my nieces my sister-in-law<br>Anna who is usually is looking the most<br>sensible of all of us my brother-in-law<br>James and Mom again and sappy the dog um<br>this was taken before the pandemic when<br>time was normal and so apologies to my<br>nieces and nephews for those old photos<br>you look much cooler now I know um and<br>then there's another picture of the four<br>of us<br>there I was a pretty a yeah here we go<br>yeah I was a pretty average student at<br>school has to be said um and I took off<br>to the University of York as Richard<br>said uh and um studied<br>sociology<br>uh sociology to me was was interesting<br>but I don't think I really got it when I<br>was that age it it there was um it was<br>at the time of late ' 80s early 90s<br>where a lot of the neoliberal furite<br>reforms were coming into play in England<br>and there were a lot of people my my<br>peers at the University whose families<br>were living through those reforms and<br>what that meant for them in person I<br>come from a very privileged upper middle<br>class Edinburgh background and I just<br>didn't really understand some of the the<br>challenges that people were were um<br>coming up against then but there were a<br>few things that kind of stuck um I got<br>a uh what used to be called a<br>Sportsman's but we'll call it sports<br>persons given the topic degree of a 22<br>and took my um careers advisor uh um<br>advice very seriously when she walked<br>into the second last lecture of our of<br>our degree and said if you're going to<br>do a degree in sociology you won't be<br>getting a job and so off I went<br>traveling for a bit and uh that was the<br>first time that I came to Aro New<br>Zealand in 1993 and had a bit of a look<br>around and I'm I'm really grateful that<br>I um I saw New Zealand<br>then I came back to the UK and went to<br>the University of Sheffield to start my<br>Ms in sport<br>management um that was really kind of<br>luck as well as good judgment um again<br>it was um at a time where uh there was a<br>lot of money going into English sport um<br>as Richard has said the the the<br>professionalization of sport<br>organizations that had until that time<br>been amateur very volunteer<br>and and Sport organizations were really<br>kind of trying to work out what to do<br>with this money and this professionalism<br>and and and this um demand really for<br>accountability and Sport management as<br>an academic discipline was really just<br>starting off in the UK then as well it<br>been well entrenched in in the United<br>States and Canada where there's a much<br>stronger professional um ethos but it<br>was really just just starting and and I<br>I really loved that um I really Lov<br>doing my master it was it was a really<br>great time and I thought that I would<br>end up working in sport development<br>because that's what I thought I would<br>do I went off to um my first job uh<br>which was in Bedford there just north of<br>um London very small town Market town<br>and I did work for a year for what was<br>initially called The Sports Council and<br>in a dramatic demonstration of<br>anglocentric behavior suddenly the<br>sports counts realized there are three<br>other countries in the United Kingdom so<br>they had to rapidly change their name to<br>the English Sports<br>Council um just saying<br>um that was that was that was a kind of<br>a tricky time because um it really was<br>an example of people who had been in the<br>amateur World very quickly becoming<br>professional and very quickly having to<br>make decisions about what they were<br>going to do with funding and really not<br>thinking about the um consequences of<br>some of the actions that that they were<br>taking so assumptions about women's<br>ability girls ability and Sport were<br>really just unquestioningly turned into<br>policies and programs that did very<br>little to try and<br>um try and um rebalance some of the um<br>the inconsistencies and the and the um<br>the unfairness that was was embedded in<br>that um in that<br>institution so<br>it was not uncommon for example for for<br>the men who were in The more senior<br>positions to say things like well you<br>know why should we fund women's sport<br>why should we fund girls sport what does<br>it matter that they're you know off on<br>the terrible playing fields and the guys<br>have got the good Fields it just just<br>didn't really matter and of course I<br>found that extremely frustrating having<br>come from a very sporty<br>background um my job was a three-way<br>partnership between three institutions<br>uh sport England uh sorry English Sports<br>Council which later became sport England<br>dford University and the national<br>coaching Foundation that was um centered<br>up in uh leads uh in the north of<br>England<br>and a job came up at dford<br>University uh as a lecturer and I<br>thought I could do that so I went along<br>to uh got an interview and I was<br>woefully underprepared<br>uh and um uh somehow however managed to<br>make enough of an impression on this man<br>who is Professor Trevor slack uh now<br>deceased sadly um and he again on NE<br>liberal uh funding at work it was at a<br>time where um dford university that part<br>of the campus had been a teacher<br>training College uh PE teacher training<br>College a very well-known one um and<br>they were trying to build it up into a<br>research institution and he'd been<br>brought in from the University of<br>Alberta in Canada to um to do that so he<br>had a whole bunch of PhD scholarships at<br>his um fingertips which was fantastic<br>and he offered me one so I obviously<br>didn't do that badly but I was pretty<br>bad um my other supervisor uh was<br>Professor dor Penny who who some of you<br>know daor is<br>a<br>fearsome fearsome um academic she really<br>was one of those academics that or is<br>sorry Dawn uh really is of those<br>academics that um you knew you I knew my<br>PhD was nearly ready when it had no red<br>pen all over it and each page would come<br>back just covered in red pen covered in<br>red pen D knows this and I hope she<br>understands that I'm saying this with<br>great love that uh it was it was a<br>challenge I've no doubt I was a<br>challenge anyway she's at Edith Cowen<br>now So eventually I got my degree<br>looking quite surprised about it all and<br>um it was in the construction of gender<br>relations in sport organization<br>which as all PhD students will learn you<br>never would call your PhD that ever<br>again if you could do it<br>again so onto a bit of the kind of<br>academic stuff um what really grabbed me<br>when I was doing my PhD and what Dawn<br>was responsible for introducing me to<br>was was social theory and and social<br>theories and the relationship between<br>social theory and qualitative<br>methodologies what we think about what<br>we're doing and how those thoughts<br>inform our methodologies which then<br>inform the method I.E how we do our<br>research so we examine social phenomena<br>in my case sport organizations can be<br>anything you like can be academic<br>institutions it can be education it<br>could be Health anything you<br>like and in social theory what we do is<br>we we take Frameworks of ideas that have<br>been debated and discussed and written<br>about and put into into practice and not<br>put into practice over many many years<br>and decades and sometimes even centuries<br>and we try to see if those theories will<br>help us to explain the social phenomena<br>that we're wanting to understand in my<br>research I've looked at organizational<br>power so the power relations that go on<br>in organizations what does it say about<br>me standing up here in my back Cape what<br>does it say about you know the the even<br>the architecture around somewhere like a<br>a university<br>and also gender relations so why is it<br>that so often particularly in sport men<br>and men's interests are privileged over<br>women and women's interest and sexuality<br>why is it that in some sports it's still<br>okay to say well I don't want a woman<br>teaching I don't want a woman coach<br>because um she might be a lesbian and<br>she might turn my daughter into a<br>lesbian why is that still something that<br>okay and<br>Theory and methodology so these theories<br>these ideas the methodologies the way we<br>think about doing our research and the<br>research that we conduct in my case most<br>often interviews but but sometimes um<br>video blogs uh sometimes um participant<br>um observation are really tightly woven<br>so the way we think about what we do and<br>the way we do it are really closely tied<br>together these approaches are rigorous<br>and they are valid and they are<br>trustworthy they are participant<br>centered they have processes around them<br>that physical and biomechanical and and<br>positive scientists may not immediately<br>think of as being rigorous and valid and<br>trustworthy but trust me they<br>are but we don't seek rigor we don't<br>seek validity and we don't seek<br>trustworthiness trustworthiness as goals<br>of our research it is the processes that<br>we go through and what weaving Theory<br>and methodology and Method together that<br>give us rigorous valid and trustworthy<br>research and what I love about Theory<br>and is probably a good thing for me is<br>it provides what I call close distance<br>so I'm passionate about what I do but<br>Theory going back to the books and<br>reading some of the things have gone<br>before gives me the opportunity to take<br>a step back and go back to the theory<br>and go hang on a minute you're getting<br>too close you're getting too passionate<br>about this let's just back off a bit and<br>see if we can um just get a bit of<br>distance from what it is that we're<br>doing so that's the approach that I've<br>taken throughout my<br>career one of the main things that I<br>looked at particularly when I was<br>starting out was um gender<br>discourse and one of the best<br>explanations of discourses that I've<br>ever come across you hear this word a<br>lot in in kind of media and and sort of<br>social discourse and narratives at the<br>moment is the space between what can be<br>said when you observe something and then<br>what we actually say so you might be<br>watching a women's rugby match for the<br>sake of argument you might be watching<br>the matter too and there might not be<br>very many people in the crowd and<br>someone might say oh well no one watches<br>women's sports no one cares about women<br>sport that would be a<br>discourse they have seen that and that's<br>what they have chosen to say somebody<br>else might say well yeah but the reason<br>that people aren't watching it is<br>because actually been programmed exactly<br>the same time as the Highlanders game<br>and so maybe we could have done that<br>differently and more people might have<br>watched the matter too and somebody<br>might say well women's sport don't make<br>money so doesn't make money so what's<br>the point and somebody else might say<br>yes women's sport might not make money<br>but actually nor does a lot of men's<br>sport and the money that is made in<br>men's sport is only made because it has<br>been invested in for generations and<br>generations so you can see that you take<br>something like an empty Stadium at a<br>women's rugby game and there are<br>multiple ways that we can understand it<br>right I wasn't sure if you could<br>actually see this but um that's the<br>that's the writing but I take it you<br>have and I think many of us in the room<br>May perhaps have been in a situation<br>where this could possibly have been the<br>case now the uh White European dude who<br>um kind of came up with the idea of<br>discourse or popularized it I suppose as<br>this man Michelle Fuko and yes I've<br>deliberately made him look a bit spooky<br>um<br>he I don't know I don't know if he<br>invented the idea but he certainly kind<br>of took it on and his his idea was to<br>look at things particularly like<br>psychology um health and uh the problem<br>with many of the social theorists is<br>that they don't think about gender so<br>one of the things I've tried to do is<br>bring gender into some of the um the<br>social theories that I work with let's<br>get rid of<br>him<br>so a few discourses that we see in sport<br>management uh and that this is some of<br>the stuff that I've worked through with<br>various<br>organizations is what has been called<br>the ad women and stir so we need to get<br>some women in to our boards so we just<br>bring them in let just bring women in to<br>our boards and and then we'll be good<br>got women in now we're done we got<br>Equity guess what if you've got a board<br>of 14 or 15 guys and one woman it's not<br>going to last very long and it's not<br>going to make much change so add adding<br>women and steering but not doing<br>anything about our structures our<br>policies our processes that's not going<br>to change<br>anything the other organizational<br>discourse that we sometimes hear is<br>fixing the women this is uh the um women<br>in leadership not all women in<br>leadership courses but some where and<br>I've been to some of them where you're<br>told that you need to dress in a certain<br>way you need to present yourself in a<br>certain way I know a chair of a provinal<br>rugby board who is a woman who was told<br>that she would never be taken seriously<br>because her voice was too soft and that<br>the people on the board couldn't hear<br>her I would suggest that some of the<br>people on the board might need their<br>hearing checked and perhaps they could<br>invest in some microphones with their<br>investment from various New Zealand<br>Rugby<br>sources the the one that kind of sticks<br>a bit is valuing women so this is sort<br>of not recent it's not recent but it's<br>been around for a while but okay we're<br>going to get bring women because women<br>will make our organization effective and<br>profitable and we'll get new members and<br>if we have women all these other women<br>are going to turn up okay yep maybe<br>maybe we will get new markets maybe we<br>will get new members but the problem<br>with this approach is that if those<br>things don't happen and don't happen<br>quickly guess who gets the<br>blame and guess who<br>leaves<br>right so I'm interested in this the easy<br>one the fourth frame making small deep<br>cultural changes to our organizations to<br>work with organizations to see can they<br>incrementally change so that those<br>places can be more welcoming more<br>balanced everybody's going to be<br>gendered everyone's got assumptions<br>about what it is to be a man and a woman<br>that's that's never going to stop and<br>all the bits in between that's never<br>going to stop but can we balance some of<br>that up a little bit just to recognize<br>some of those things in our<br>organizations and make some changes to<br>make them uh<br>more<br>Equitable the fourth frame and Sport<br>management can look a little bit like<br>this we have outcome based funding<br>so on the face of it outcome based<br>funding sounds great if you win lots of<br>medals sport<br>organizations you're going to get uh<br>lots of money the other way you can<br>think about this is winning at all cost<br>costs and often those costs are at the<br>mental and physical health of athletes<br>and coaches so I would say let's think<br>more broadly than<br>that reviews into cycling into rowing<br>into Athletics into gymnastics and to<br>hockey suggests outcomes based funding<br>isn't such a great idea and it can have<br>really detrimental effects on the people<br>who we are trying to make get these<br>medals so let's think a little<br>differently about our funding<br>let's also think a little bit<br>differently about the way we do things<br>around here okay this is this is always<br>good um and just recently just last week<br>some of the girls at the Mi rata which<br>is a big Rowing competition uh<br>questioned why should the girls have to<br>always go first in their eight final<br>which is the big final and then they get<br>scraped off the podium smartish so the<br>boys can then go and do their because<br>the boys is the important one<br>and fair play to Mar regata they're like<br>yep okay we can probably do something<br>about that and maybe rotate it well done<br>that's great others have<br>said because it's boys rowing that's<br>more interesting and those are the<br>people that are going to go to the<br>Olympics and and and and and all those<br>other excuses and don't be woke so um<br>those are some of the sort of<br>conversations that go on and I would say<br>well let's just challenge some of the<br>things that we do around<br>here and finally our for frame that I<br>would like to I like to encourage is our<br>use of language in our sport<br>organizations and and this<br>one is recent and at first sight you<br>might take a look at that and say oh<br>that looks all right that's that's good<br>no more boys clubs excellent but if you<br>dig just a little deeper you'll find<br>that that comes straight from the<br>Playbook from organizations like save<br>women's sport<br>australasia whose sole purpose is to to<br>exclude trans women from sport uh at all<br>levels so this is some of the language<br>that is being used potentially to<br>inform potentially we haven't had the we<br>haven't had a statement yet to inform<br>some of the regulation and future<br>funding of sport<br>organizations and to me personally that<br>is<br>abhorrent so these are some of the uh<br>thoughts that thoughts work that has<br>informed my research um I'd like to just<br>point out Wendy frisbee who's at the top<br>there Professor Wendy frisbee from the<br>University of British Columbia and<br>Professor Lina habber who are two good<br>friends and great researchers and I've<br>been lucky enough to work with them for<br>a little<br>while<br>um so that was a little bit of time and<br>then I think it's always somehow been on<br>the cards that I would end up in Arora<br>and this on<br>unbelievably is a picture of me in about<br>1978 playing<br>tiraco in a school in<br>Edinburgh who how I don't know I can't<br>remember how I just assume that someone<br>somewhere thought that was a good idea<br>there I am practicing my associate Dean<br>look um and what I love about this<br>picture actually is if you look to this<br>girl here these two here very cute and<br>the it's back in the day when kids<br>didn't get their photos taken often<br>right and they're like oh look you<br>having your photo taken cool you know<br>would you get that now I don't know<br>anyway um so sure enough I did end up in<br>New<br>Zealand and um moved here as Richard's<br>already said in<br>202 with my then partner Justine Allen<br>we also did um a fair bit of research<br>together<br>so when we moved when I moved to New<br>Zealand I didn't want to jump straight<br>in into the gender stuff because uh I<br>wasn't sure of the lay of the land<br>different new country different cultures<br>uh learning uh a little bit about<br>tari um and and I know this may be hard<br>for some of you to believe but I didn't<br>actually want to jump on too many<br>sensitivities in one go um so we were<br>lucky enough to be involved in a project<br>that was going on around sport<br>governance uh and particularly working<br>between trust W Cato and Sport W Cato<br>who had a partnership<br>uh which really was quite Cutting Edge<br>at the time and and really focused on<br>rather than outputs they really focused<br>on Trust on humanity and and trying to<br>work well together as as partners when<br>they um were putting things into putting<br>um programs and policies and so on into<br>play so that was a that was a that was<br>an interesting time and it was good to<br>have that research because it did give<br>me a bit of time to learn a little bit<br>about artero<br>uh and um and uh yeah just get a sense<br>really of of what what was going<br>on um however one moment see if the<br>shaky there really should be a robot<br>that can do that<br>um however I couldn't help myself of<br>course and so um at the<br>time so this is what 2006 uh New Zealand<br>was was starting to also starting to<br>professionalize more so the Hillary<br>commission had become spark in about<br>2002 I think and that signaled a change<br>in how sport was funded we went from<br>donations and grants to much more<br>competitive funding um and as with uh<br>what we'd seen in the UK about a decade<br>earlier uh there was more attention sort<br>of starting to be paid to uh to gender<br>relations um largely because as some of<br>these kind of traditional um gender<br>relations were being um expressed in the<br>professional organizations more and more<br>women were saying look you just you have<br>to pay attention to us actually you know<br>we're not just going to take this so I<br>did a little study um which asked the<br>question should spark should what SP New<br>Zealand was eventually became um should<br>they be guiding gender relations in<br>Regional Sports trusts should they be<br>putting things in place should we have<br>Equity programs should we have Equity<br>policies uh the short answer to that<br>was no the regional Sports trust uh<br>managers and CEOs said no I don't think<br>we should they also thought we would<br>tell spark to mind their own business if<br>they started to do things like that and<br>that honestly was a little bit of a<br>surprise I don't know why but it<br>was I do know why because I think in the<br>UK things had moved along a little bit<br>and I was a little startled that SP<br>spark was not taking more of a role in<br>getting women women involved in<br>sport until I went to a conference and<br>presented this Stu and a person from<br>spark stood up stood up in the questions<br>which is unusual and said well we don't<br>recognize gender as a<br>problem and many of you have heard story<br>before but I still wish and I will take<br>this to my grave wishing that I had been<br>fast enough to say well I don't<br>recognize you but you're still standing<br>here being a right pain but or something<br>to that effect anyway I missed the<br>opportunity that might be the last time<br>I tell that story so hang on to it<br>um<br>so yeah so it was a bit of a tricky time<br>I sort of I had very kind of hopeful<br>ideas that that I might be able to work<br>with sport organizations in New Zealand<br>because it's you know is a smaller<br>country everyone knows each other in the<br>sport world and that perhaps there might<br>be some flexibility and perhaps there<br>might be some appetite for change but<br>this really suggested perhaps not at the<br>time the other thing that came out a we<br>bit later on was this policy and this<br>was why women on company go boards are<br>good for business now if you're still<br>with me you may recall that that is a<br>good example of valuing the women<br>valuing the<br>feminine and I remember actually driving<br>out of countdown when this was announced<br>on the radio and hitting my steering<br>wheel I was so cross that that that this<br>was it 10 years nearly after there was<br>research saying not just my research<br>plenty of research across various<br>Industries saying this doesn't work that<br>this was going to be it this is how we<br>are going to make women useful to our<br>businesses<br>and there were a number of things kind<br>of going on at the time uh not least the<br>breakup of my long-term relationship but<br>also this that really made me question<br>what I was doing and why I was doing it<br>here in New Zealand and I certainly<br>toyed with the idea of packing in being<br>an academic I certainly toyed with the<br>idea of um going back to the UK going to<br>the US doing something else and and I<br>also decided because I didn't have<br>enough on my plate that I would start to<br>address uh my lifetime companion which<br>is a generalized anxiety disorder so I<br>thought I'll just put all that together<br>uh in a nice package and the reason for<br>bringing this up not to kill the mood is<br>that anxiety is an interesting you can<br>do this if you like it's pretty good um<br>anxiety is a great<br>motivator isn't it<br>Ken only if you manage it well and I<br>wasn't managing it<br>well and what I was telling myself was<br>if I didn't keep doing all this stuff<br>something terrible was going to<br>happen the trick is once you start<br>managing it and realizing that the<br>something terrible maybe isn't going to<br>happen you then have to take a really<br>good look at yourself and say okay so<br>why actually am I doing this if I'm not<br>doing this because of the terrible thing<br>why am I doing this and so I went<br>through quite a lot of breathe in and<br>breathe outs and I still do go through<br>like quite a lot of those trying to<br>figure it all<br>out so that's just a something to think<br>about and maybe to take away is once you<br>you know knowing why you're doing what<br>you're doing I guess is a is a kind of<br>important<br>message I will be very grateful to these<br>people be forever because while I was<br>really struggling with where I sat with<br>gender stuff in in New Zealand what I<br>was doing with my own mental health uh<br>and life in general a number of um a<br>number of people knocked on my door uh<br>not literally and um said would I like<br>to be involved in a number of these in<br>these research projects and<br>um the good thing about them was that I<br>wasn't having to lead them so so I was<br>able to kind of go along and help out<br>where I<br>could Sarah lebman who's top what's that<br>top left for you guys in the orange uh<br>she got me involved in a bunch of really<br>interesting research about leadership<br>with women career Readiness uh and doing<br>some investigations into gambling<br>revenue and Sport organizations Lorina<br>who is a long lifelong friend uh and my<br>academic sister as I call her um got me<br>involved in some some work around<br>qualitative research methods and that's<br>something that I've kept going with uh<br>Robin and pip Lynch um we did some<br>pretty cool work I think on governance<br>and outdoor uh<br>organizations and then bottom right for<br>you is uh Lisa Keel and Vicky schul at<br>the University of Minnesota who were<br>doing some work on the merger of um the<br>men's and women's athletic departments a<br>tier one University which was I can tell<br>you quite the story and yes I do do<br>research with men<br>too uh associate professor Jeff Dixon<br>who's now at Latrobe and Jeff and I uh<br>did a project on um on that merger of<br>women's and men's golf in uh in uh New<br>Zealand so they kind of just kept me<br>ticking over and it was all good and and<br>life carried on as it does then then<br>then this this report came out this out<br>in the fields report is was uh developed<br>by Eric Dennison and his colleagues at<br>uh monach in in Australia first<br>international study on homophobia and<br>Sport uh and what they do was they did<br>uh inter no not interviews they did a<br>survey um across multiple countries uh<br>looking at both gay and straight<br>people's um uh experiences of homophobia<br>in sport and what it looked like and<br>it's it's a very revealing and<br>interesting um report and and certainly<br>hugely insightful and that just kind of<br>got me kind of thinking a wee bit at the<br>same sort of time a year later New<br>Zealand Rugby as you might remember M<br>was going through a bit of a disaster um<br>they had a uh series of sex scandals and<br>they eventually decided to um have a<br>review of their culture regarding gender<br>and sex sexuality um in rugby so that<br>came out at that point too and I was s<br>thinking okay there might be you know<br>bit life in the old dog yet and then a<br>year later uh the sport and active<br>Recreation uh women and girls um uh uh<br>strategy came out from um sport New<br>Zealand so things were just starting to<br>turn the corner a bit in in in my<br>world and what really grabbed me was<br>these two comments in these reports that<br>New Zealand Rugby was willing to at<br>least<br>consider uh what gender sexuality and<br>ethnicity meant um in terms of people's<br>experience of rugby and that that's that<br>was you that was pretty groundbreaking<br>for New Zealand Rugby to be able to do<br>that and fair play to<br>them and in uh the women of sport uh<br>strategy a drive orbe it a short<br>sentence but still a drive to understand<br>the challenges and opportunities women<br>and girls can face due to sexual<br>orientation so these three things kind<br>of they they gave me a bit of a kick in<br>the butt to be perfectly honest and so I<br>thought right I'm going to do this I'm<br>going to stick my neck out and I'm going<br>to get involved in this the out in the<br>fields report did not have a<br>representative in New Zealand so I<br>offered to become their New Zealand rep<br>that project was kind of finished so<br>they like we were kind of done so no<br>thanks um but they did put me in touch<br>with various people uh in artero who<br>were involved with it and the question<br>that this really got me looking at was<br>which women are we talking about when we<br>talk about women in sport and<br>we don't often look at the experiences<br>of sexually diverse uh women in sports<br>so this you know really was something<br>that I am passionate about and able to<br>get<br>Rugby and Ian long who was the head of<br>public affairs at the time there uh was<br>um starting a group called sport for<br>everyone and and uh this had uh those<br>five five not six sorry five um Sports<br>involved in<br>it and the premise of this group at the<br>start was to look at homophobia in sport<br>across these five<br>sports and they got together they met I<br>met with them I I mapped out perhaps how<br>they might go about you know finding out<br>you know what maybe some of the makeup<br>of their organizations was uh how could<br>they perhaps be more inclusive did they<br>feel the need to be inclusive who was it<br>that they wanted to to work with so we<br>had a few meetings about about that and<br>then<br>slowly and some of you may have already<br>observed there are there were quite a<br>few differences in the makeup of this<br>group and that made this really tricky<br>so you can see on the um right hand<br>column there that we've got one two<br>three four different<br>uh titles of people involved in this<br>project you got head of public affairs<br>Community netball a technical manager so<br>that's things like rules and regulations<br>of the game another Community<br>Development and then Human Resources so<br>we had these really conflicting<br>priorities working towards this not<br>terribly well- defined goal tricky<br>goal as time went on<br>um the other than New Zealand Rugby the<br>other organizations also decided that<br>actually they had other priorities and<br>who it was that they wanted to work with<br>in terms of inclusion whether that was<br>gender whether that was disability<br>whether it was<br>ethnicity uh and and so the the um the<br>the group kind of disbanded and there is<br>always the way you know you're very in<br>these situations you're very reliant on<br>the people who the individuals who are<br>holding the um holding the torch and and<br>showing the way and once they start to<br>leave these things kind of um go by the<br>wayside so there wasn't just the the<br>various people who are responsible it<br>was also you know who are we talking to<br>who is our community who are the people<br>that we want to address who are the<br>people that we want to<br>include uh and talking about sexuality<br>is really difficult right is not easy<br>it's it's hard uh and so trying to<br>encourage people within organizations to<br>start to try and think about how how how<br>do we talk about sexuality in our<br>organization what are some of the ways<br>that we understand<br>Sport AS sexualized is our sport<br>somewhere that homophobic slay is is<br>really common if it<br>is do we what do we care do we want to<br>care do we want to do something about it<br>how do we do that so really kind of<br>moving these uh organizations into a<br>space that is is<br>challenging and um it's fair to say it<br>was quite chaotic uh and so I wrote that<br>the chaos of<br>inclusion um and and it really started<br>to I really started to understand how<br>difficult some of this work was for<br>sport<br>organizations so then uh I also went<br>back to my theories and I realized that<br>the theories that I've been using didn't<br>quite cut it so I went into uh another<br>load of books and I've started in the<br>last few years reading about queer<br>Theory all that queer Theory means is<br>that it is a theory it's a it's a group<br>of theories that talks about disrupting<br>and challenging some of our norms and uh<br>taken for granted assumptions in my case<br>about how organizations work doesn't<br>have to be about being queer it is a<br>it's a it's um a verb to um destabilized<br>to to unsettle some of our assumptions<br>and at its core are um our challenges to<br>some of the things that we take for<br>granted so if we start to think about<br>gender on a Continuum or as flexible and<br>fluid then perhaps men and women and our<br>understandings of sport are not as<br>different as we might have first thought<br>so perhaps there's a little bit of over<br>AP and a little bit of common ground<br>that we can work on and that helps us<br>maybe to blur some of the boundaries<br>between them and us in our<br>organizations it also offers the<br>opportunity to think about<br>intersectionality which is where we<br>don't just talk about men and women and<br>gay and straight we start to bring in<br>ideas about ethnicity disability age<br>other identities that uh that will be at<br>play so we start to build a picture of<br>our<br>organizations that is complex but it<br>also reflects the complexity of those<br>organizations we are complex people if<br>we all took a doodle pole not doodle<br>pole a vbox poll about the things are<br>important to us we'd all have different<br>thoughts we'd all have different<br>experiences and that's how organizations<br>work we're a mix of a whole bunch of<br>different<br>people and when organ organizations<br>start to recognize that and start to<br>kind of try and see what our<br>commonalities are then there might be a<br>little glimpse of ways that we can<br>change to become more inclusive for the<br>people who are not traditionally<br>included and in that way inclusion just<br>becomes an everyday thing we start to<br>challenge the language we start to say<br>actually I think we've got more in<br>common than than actually we first<br>thought change isn't necessarily a goal<br>we don't try and Achieve<br>Equity but by working every day in these<br>little ways maybe it's change and<br>inclusion and Equity might be something<br>that might<br>happen and the thing I really like about<br>it is it's creative so in the messiness<br>and the chaos and the craziness of our<br>organizational lives there is room there<br>are gaps there is potential for Change<br>and I have to thank uh Rosie overell and<br>um Bethany gecko really for introducing<br>me to this um this<br>approach so I went back to rugby again<br>because they hadn't seen enough of me<br>and by this time the wonderful Judy<br>O'Brien was work is working at um New<br>Zealand Rugby she is a culture Diversy<br>and inclusion manager and if you get a<br>chance to read anything about Judy<br>please do she is extraordinary I hope I<br>hope and I think that New Zealand Rugby<br>now know how lucky they are to have her<br>in this<br>role and what I<br>felt what I had seen and observed anyway<br>in my kind of observing of New Zealand<br>Rugby was that although in the men's<br>game it's extremely homophobic in many<br>ways in the women's game not so much and<br>it was was the year when the um the<br>black FS 15s and sevens were doing<br>really well<br>and you see this absolute celebration of<br>same-sex relationships in those in those<br>teams and it struck me that you know if<br>that's happening at you know if we can<br>just that's just how it is at those top<br>levels what is it that's going on in the<br>community levels of of um sport of<br>women's uh rugby that perhaps is making<br>it a bit different what can we learn<br>from women's rugby in terms of inclusion<br>of different<br>sexualities<br>what can New Zealand Rugby learn for its<br>you know big picture and and what can we<br>as sport managers learn so I went uh to<br>New Zealand Rugby and they were they<br>were generous enough I must admit to let<br>me do this because they might not have<br>um and I did a survey and some<br>interviews with uh some uh<br>self-identifying women in the lgbtq plus<br>community and just a couple of things<br>I'll focus on because there masses<br>obviously<br>but<br>one of the things that came through so<br>strongly was this community and this Pho<br>that women's rugby had this is at the<br>community Grassroots level we're not<br>talking black ferns absolutely not we're<br>talking about Grassroots<br>level and the sense that we look after<br>ourselves and we include people and if<br>someone's going to come in and make some<br>silly joke we're going to say say no<br>we're not having that deal with it and<br>this is this is how how we operate and<br>this is um how we look after our sisters<br>and and we we embrace them and we love<br>them and we celebrate<br>them so humor humor can be a brilliant<br>way in organizations to make change and<br>to and to um inspire people and this is<br>what they're doing they're like okay<br>we're not going to get offended by this<br>we're just going to<br>give this guy a and you know tell<br>him this not what's going to happen this<br>is this is how we're going to role in<br>this<br>organization slightly more<br>seriously um this quote is in relation<br>to the strange thing in women's sport<br>where some coaches and some players<br>mainly coaches get very uptight about<br>same-sex couples in the same team and<br>they feel that because because you're in<br>a relationship you're going to wreck the<br>team culture wreck the team team spirit<br>and there are several instances um where<br>coaches have banned lesbian couples from<br>being in the same uh team at the same<br>time<br>they the the point that this respondent<br>is making is that okay put the spotlight<br>sure put the spotlight on same seex<br>couples all right but if we're going to<br>do that we have to do the same for<br>heterosexual couples and families that<br>are really heavily involved in sport it<br>nobody bats an eyelid if a husband<br>coaches a wife's team and yet the<br>potential for conflict of interest there<br>is just as great as two women on the<br>same team you<br>know parents coach their kids you know<br>and and yep great good on you Mom Dad<br>for coming along and coaching but does<br>anyone ever really question that no they<br>really don't so if you're going to<br>question the same sex relationship and<br>the sport question the other<br>relationships too let's make this<br>discourse Equitable let's make this an<br>equitable playing field unfortunately I<br>didn't speak to Ruby 2 but she's cool so<br>I left her up<br>there um and then as some of you may<br>know the FIFA Women's World Cup rolled<br>into town last<br>year and this project which I'm still<br>doing is with uh Monica Nelson who's on<br>the top there and Professor Simone figar<br>hi Monica hi Simone I think you're<br>watching live hope the popcorn's good<br>Simone um and we wanted to uh look at<br>the experiences of lgbtq plus uh fans<br>and participants in in the Women's World<br>Cup mainly because again how the Women's<br>World Cup was portrayed as something<br>that was going to be about women for<br>women um embracing and developing women<br>and my lovely grad students here know<br>much more about this than I do but the<br>question is never asked for which women<br>what about the lgbtq plus<br>women uh those women are used to<br>advertise it Megan rapo mechan rapino<br>Sam Kerr right there front and center<br>but what's the experience like for those<br>themselves<br>so here is a quote from a participant<br>who's<br>saying talking about this idea of<br>intersectionality make sure that we are<br>you know in the conversation for sport<br>organizations make sure that we exist<br>make sure that we're given a place to<br>feel safe look at yourselves sport<br>organizations and see what it is you can<br>do to do a better job of representing us<br>and others like<br>us again self safe spaces not we don't<br>want to be tolerated we don't want to be<br>accepted we want to be embraced and<br>celebrated just like everybody else is<br>just like you know we want to get into<br>it we want to enjoy it we want to be<br>part of it we want to get into the<br>arguments the debates the discussions we<br>don't bringing the Gaze we don't want<br>that and then this you know we exist we<br>are people who deserve to be taken<br>organizations to quote<br>pink kindness is a revolutionary act and<br>many other people have said that<br>recently but I think at the moment<br>you know this sort<br>of potential to bow bow down to hatred<br>or fear particularly in the trans women<br>space at the moment is so close and<br>tight and just take the time to think in<br>our sport organizations about what can<br>we do differently to just<br>organizations it come as a huge surprise<br>to you that not everybody loves my<br>research and these are some of the<br>adjectives that have been directed to me<br>at various times during my research and<br>and also in my work as associate Dean<br>postgraduate<br>um and frankly I love it it's either<br>going to be a t-shirt or a gravestone I<br>don't know whichever um I'll take both<br>um the one that I do reflect on a little<br>bit is is is being called being uh<br>called woke in a by participant who said<br>something along the lines of you woke<br>academics are all the same you're trying<br>to stir something up out of nothing just<br>leave us alone we want to just<br>participate in our<br>Sport and that really struck me and I've<br>did a conference presentation about last<br>year because it's all very well you know<br>jumping up and down on my academic<br>bandwagon and saying we've got to do<br>better with sport organizations but I<br>also have to remember and those of us in<br>this kind of area need to remember that<br>some people do just want to get on with<br>what it is they're doing and don't want<br>to be you know looked at so that has<br>given me uh pause for thought and and<br>fair<br>enough um having said that of course<br>uh I will always I think<br>be<br>um that<br>person uh as long as I've got the of<br>being an academic and being an academic<br>is a privilege there is no doubt about<br>that with that comes a huge<br>responsibility and in my view and in my<br>world and this is not the same for<br>everybody that responsibility is to work<br>with sport organizations in as positive<br>a way as I possibly can and it's not<br>always positive work to try and help<br>those sport organizations to Grapple<br>with some things that are are tricky and<br>are difficult and do need a bit of mind<br>bending<br>and if I'm allowed into those spaces<br>then then I feel very grateful and I<br>really I love working with school<br>organizations because the ones that want<br>me in are generally trying to do<br>something none of this of course would<br>be<br>possible without my lovely wife Janice<br>Murray who I love to the moon and back<br>and some of you know her as ameritus<br>Professor Janice Murray some of you

say<br>something what should I say she like<br>soes IM Mahana so I have the privilege<br>of being the dean of the school of<br>physical education so it's with the<br>greatest pleasure that I conclude<br>Professor Shaw's inaugural profess<br>professorial lecture um so as professors<br>Brock and Barker alluded to at the start<br>um Sally's work is um of the highest<br>standard she has shown impact I don't<br>need to explain that to you you have<br>just seen um what she has presented um<br>but she has made outstanding<br>contribution and Leadership to the<br>gender diversity and inclusion practices<br>and policies within the field of sport<br>governance and what I took from that is<br>that she just doesn't make a difference<br>in the field of Academia but actually in<br>the world of sport governance so it's<br>happening in practice which is a pretty<br>good thing to be able to see that you're<br>achieving and see difference cuz that's<br>literally why we do this job to make a<br>difference in the<br>world um she also in making those<br>impacts in the sport governance world is<br>making a difference to the athletes who<br>are working who are participating in<br>those fields um and again that's a<br>really special thing to see that you're<br>making a difference in the athletes<br>lives um and she also achieves that<br>through her excellent teaching both<br>through our undergraduates and her<br>postgraduates um who will be the future<br>of sport governance in New Zealand and<br>internet nationally because you do seem<br>to attract a lot of international<br>students which is<br>fantastic um just a couple of things so<br>from a personal perspective Professor<br>Shaw and I have been next door office<br>neighbors for a lot of years now and one<br>highlight for me was when she knocked on<br>my door and said elen I think I want to<br>do a survey can you help me with<br>quantitative methods so she has talked a<br>lot about her qualitative background but<br>she has made a fory into survey based<br>research so that was a bit of a priv pre<br>for me to help her uh create a survey so<br>she could do her work with rugby and uh<br>the FIFA World Cup um and she didn't<br>also mention that she's made a fory into<br>academic tick Tok um which she also said<br>which is also a highlight so if you are<br>not aware then Google Sally Shaw Tik Tok<br>and I'm sure it will come<br>up um I've also appreci appreciated your<br>words of wisam and support over the<br>years so it's um I'm very grateful to be<br>able to celebrate with you today um and<br>my last joke I expect that being pro<br>promoted to Professor was easier and<br>less frustrating than reducing your golf<br>handicap yes and I have seen a lot of<br>these faces that were on her golf<br>pictures within the department as well<br>so it's not just a golf specific face<br>that you have uh so I'll just end by<br>thanking all of you for coming to<br>acknowledge Professor Shaw's<br>achievements and for those if there are<br>any online at stupid o' in Scotland um<br>and anywhere else in the world thank you<br>for tuning in and H showing your support<br>um I get to invite you guys over to the<br>staff Club um after the formal<br>proceedings concludes to continue the<br>celebrations and to Sally we university<br>has a gift for you so that you will<br>occasion</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
