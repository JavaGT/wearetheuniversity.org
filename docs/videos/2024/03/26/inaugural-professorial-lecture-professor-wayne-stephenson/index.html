of atago and it's my great<br>pleasure to welcome you all to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture to Mark<br>the promotion of Wayne Stevenson to<br>Professor I'd like to give a warm<br>welcome to you all but particularly to<br>Wayne's family and friends who are with<br>us in person and online I'd like to give<br>special welcome to Wayne's partner Karen<br>um and their four Sons Michael Connor<br>Liam and James and I've also learned<br>today that um Wayne's best man's also<br>here too so welcome<br>Kevin um inaugural professorial lectures<br>are a great opportunity to learn more<br>about our talented researchers and to<br>showcase the excellent research that<br>occurs across the University<br>and as many of you know promotion to<br>Professor atago is not something that's<br>easily achieved um we require our<br>academics to show outstanding competence<br>and leadership in teaching research and<br>service and Wayne has demonstrated all<br>of<br>these as you'll shortly hear Wayne is a<br>geographer with research and teaching<br>interests in coastal GE<br>geomorphology his research is focused on<br>how Rock coasts respond to tectonics and<br>climate change Wayne is also an<br>excellent teacher and a strong<br>contributor to the university and I've<br>had the pleasure of working with Wayne<br>on the board of Graduate Studies for a<br>while and can attest to his dedication<br>and expertise in his role as associate<br>Dean<br>postgraduate so congratulation Ryan on<br>your deserved promotion and I'm very<br>much looking forward to your lecture and<br>I'm now going to hand over to um<br>Professor etan Nel to provide a formal<br>introduction to Professor Stevenson Nora<br>ten uh kioro Coto it's an honor and a<br>privilege this evening to introduce you<br>to Professor Wayne Stevenson as the<br>school of geography's most recently<br>promoted Professor well done Wayne I<br>would like to extend a warm welcome this<br>evening to all of you who joining us<br>here tonight either in person or uh<br>through live streaming but most<br>especially to Wayne's family and friends<br>who were here with us tonight this<br>evening's event is a key milestone in<br>Wayne's career it's a celebration of<br>what he's achieved but also a<br>celebration of his success as an<br>academic it's my task and pleasure to<br>Pro to provide a brief overview of his<br>many achievements across his career<br>which have led up to this event tonight<br>and to his promotion as I'm sure Wayne<br>will share with us shortly he was born<br>in deden but has very strong roots in<br>South atago his tertiary education was<br>all undertaken at the University of<br>Canterbury we had the Good Fortune to be<br>mentored by Professor Bob cook who<br>supervised Wayne's PhD but whom I am<br>told played a formative role when when<br>Wayne was in the first year of his<br>studies apparently on a memorable field<br>trip encouraged Wayne to blend his<br>interests in both physical geography and<br>Uber diving now all of those come<br>together quite nicely I'm sure in what<br>we'll hear about tonight I'm told that<br>the result of this interaction was many<br>enjoyable trips to look at both the<br>geography and to do scuba diving um at<br>particularly at kakura now kakura is a<br>place we'll hear a lot about tonight<br>it's been quite key in not only in<br>Wayne's PhD work but also the extremely<br>significant research work he's<br>undertaken there most particularly not<br>only in hisp D but more recently in the<br>2016 earthquake in and around kakura uh<br>a major event which led to a dramatic<br>uplift of the seabed an event which<br>Wayne has studied in depth and one which<br>has certainly strengthened his academic<br>standing as a scholar when is a<br>geographer with specialist expertise in<br>coastal geomorphology and more<br>specifically how Rock hsts respond to<br>techn te sorry tectonics and climate<br>change including the investigation of<br>complex interactions between processes<br>of coastal erosion and sea level rise<br>his PhD examined the evolution of shore<br>Platforms in kakura before joining us at<br>otago Wayne was a senior lecture at the<br>University of Melbourne and across his<br>career he has undertaken work research<br>and research collaborations in the<br>Maldives Mexico the UK USA China and<br>Australia through his research work he<br>has led investigations into sea level<br>rise Marine Terraces and Coastal erosion<br>his work has enabled direct<br>collaboration with ewi regional councils<br>and numerous Coastal communities the<br>applied significance of his work is<br>borne out through an impressive range of<br>technical reports and advice rendered to<br>numerous authorities including the port<br>of Littleton Port otago the UK<br>government the maray darling Basin<br>author it and numerous Coastal<br>communities across<br>australasia these applied contributions<br>are matched with his significant<br>research output to date he has 74<br>research articles and chapters to his<br>name and an authored book entitled Rock<br>Coast<br>geomorphology many of his published<br>articles are in well-respected<br>international journals such as Earth<br>surface processes nature Communications<br>geomorphology and Coastal management<br>as Wayne's career has strengthened he<br>has been able to support a growing<br>number of postgraduate students some of<br>whom are here tonight and some of whom<br>are watching over the live stream he has<br>supervised 48 postgraduate students to<br>date including 13<br>phds in terms of external service Wayne<br>serves on the boards of two<br>International journals and has been the<br>editor of two other journals namely<br>geographical research and the Journal of<br>maps<br>in addition to his highly successful<br>publishing and research career Wayne is<br>a well-liked and well respected figure<br>on our campus and in our school and in<br>the division of humanities he currently<br>plays a critical role as the associate<br>Dean Graduate Studies in geography has<br>played key roles in our teing on our<br>teaching and learning committee and<br>through his coordination of our key and<br>very popular first year paper in<br>environment and<br>Society having outlined Wayne's<br>impressive and very successful academic<br>career it would be remiss not to also<br>mention Wayne's various other interests<br>most prominent amongst these is<br>ultramarathon running four four days ago<br>he participated in the 56 kilm Long<br>Three Peaks Marathon which I'm told has<br>a height variation of several thousand<br>meters as it progresses around the hills<br>of of denen well well done Wayne on<br>completing that um so with those words<br>of introdu uction I would like to warmly<br>congratulate Wayne on his well-deserved<br>promotion and invite and invite him to<br>when Ian can I have the green folder<br>back Oto Oto Oto<br>C<br>wand Stevenson too cor William Stevenson<br>Toco Mata cor Wayne Stevenson tacoa cure<br>everybody uh I can't look at that yellow<br>slide anymore I'm<br>sorry thank you very much everybody for<br>coming it's wonderful to see so many<br>people Helen Ian thank you so much for<br>those wonderful words of introduction I<br>feel like everything's been said and<br>perhaps we should could just go to the<br>staff club now but uh I I'm I guess in<br>some ways I'm I'm very nervous but I'm<br>also obviously very excited to be a to<br>share with you uh the work that I've<br>done as a as a geographer uh over the<br>years so I had to prepare the title for<br>this talk some weeks ago and I realized<br>in the preparation of my talk I'm now<br>going to overpromise and underd deliver<br>uh the the elements of this Coastal<br>erosion will come through I'm afraid the<br>sea rise part of this isn't quite as<br>strong as I originally anticipated I am<br>certainly going to talk about the<br>earthquake uh in kaiura but as a<br>geographer uh I'm very proud to be a<br>geographer uh but I'm also I like to do<br>geomorphology and that's the specialism<br>that I'm most interested in so the play<br>on words here is about the between the<br>rocks and a hard place so much of my<br>research is on the Rocks uh and I'm<br>going to highlight a couple of hard<br>things about being a researcher uh and<br>doing research so I'm going to start by<br>talking about why why I think Rock<br>coasts are important and worth worthy of<br>study in the tradition of an IPL of<br>course I'll tell you a little bit of the<br>backstory about how I got here I spent a<br>lot of time over the last few weeks<br>reflecting on how I got here uh and<br>there's a lot of elements to that story<br>and I've kind of got to that stage of my<br>career where I can certainly divide my<br>research into two uh components things I<br>did before the or earthquake and things<br>that I've done since and then of course<br>I'll finish with some thanks and some<br>acknowledgements of some of the key<br>people that help me get here<br>tonight so I'm going to start with a<br>hard place and the hard place is the<br>passing of my PhD supervisor Bob Kirk on<br>the 4th of March Bob was a really<br>important part of my story and that<br>tonight uh the part of the problem here<br>and reason I'm starting to get emotional<br>was that this morning was the memorial<br>service for Bob the celebration of his<br>life in denen uh sorry it was held in<br>Christ Church and I was torn between<br>asking to postpone this evening and<br>attend the ceremony for Bob uh I didn't<br>trust you in New Zealand to get me back<br>into denan on time uh and I could also<br>hear Bob saying do the IPL you silly<br>bugger and I'm quite certain that was<br>the sentiment that Bob would have had uh<br>if I had the opportunity to ask him so<br>you'll see tonight uh Bob will come<br>through the story uh quite a lot and so<br>I'd like to dedicate tonight and this<br>Bob uh Rock Coast I Love Rock Coast<br>they're spectacular they're fantastic<br>things uh in some ways they're very<br>simple they're often typically just a<br>cliff and a Cliff's a cliff but if we<br>travel around the world and we look at<br>Rocky Coast we'll see an enormous amount<br>of variability and really wonderful<br>landscapes and I guess as a geographer<br>and a geologist I'm intrigued and I love<br>to look at these things I could show you<br>lots of slides of uh Rock Coast uh but<br>I'm not going to uh take up all my time<br>with pretty pictures Rock coasts are<br>often thought of as slow to change and<br>are resistant to climate change for<br>example resistant to sea level rise but<br>we know actually that they can be<br>dynamic and they can change very quickly<br>so uh this is The Great Ocean Road these<br>These are the the 12 apostles on The<br>Great Ocean Road uh in Victoria<br>Australia and you can see this<br>particular sea stack in 2005 fell over<br>uh and a few years later the arch at<br>Lockard Gorge just a few kilometers down<br>the road collapsed and this led to the<br>um the the mayor of the local sh the<br>local Council to call for protection<br>Works to be built to protect these<br>valuable assets and I and my commentary<br>to in the local media on this I made the<br>point well actually this stack fell over<br>on a relatively calm day okay um it<br>wasn't particularly energetic uh and you<br>know never mind the point that the<br>collapse of the arch actually created<br>two uh new sea<br>stacks but that call really sort of<br>underpins the importance of Rock Coast<br>because of the concern of course was<br>that these are a valuable asset they<br>actually generate income and they<br>generate and provide uh for the tourist<br>economy so at the 12 apostles across the<br>road uh there's an elaborate Visitor<br>Center okay that Under And so there's an<br>enormous amount of infrastructure built<br>to support the tourism industry and the<br>attraction is the rocky Coast GE<br>morphology the sea stacks especially at<br>the 12 apostles so rock coasts are<br>aesthetically pleasing Landscapes that<br>have important economic value so<br>understanding how they evolve and change<br>through time I think it's worth worthy<br>of research they also present hazards as<br>well so Coastal erosion especially if<br>sea level rises making this worse means<br>uh there's significant management issues<br>around Rock<br>coasts the hazards that Rocky coasts<br>present are not just CommunityWide they<br>can also be individual uh and threaten<br>individualizes and it's not unheard of<br>for people that have been killed by Rock<br>Falls uh beneath sea CLS so just note<br>the little corner of this particular<br>piece i' been photographing this section<br>of coas again on the at the 12 apostles<br>waiting for this whole pie<br>to fall off the last time was there a<br>little corner of it had fallen off and<br>that had uh resulted in a sign warning<br>people about rockfall um uh and to be<br>careful of this threat when you you like<br>this one you're going to love the next<br>one uh because you individuals uh can uh<br>can be killed by rockfall but doesn't<br>matter how good your signage<br>is some people will uh accept and take<br>the risk and sit at the base of the<br>cliff so Coastal hazards as well now uh<br>it used to be the case that and I used<br>to take great pride in this we could<br>claim that about 80% of the world's<br>Coastline had a cliff or was Rocky um<br>that was all right until the satellite<br>data arrived uh and some analysis of the<br>satellite uh imagery showed that<br>actually it's only probably about 50% so<br>half the world's Coastline has a rocky<br>uh morphology or a rocky shape so these<br>are a significant Coastal land for<br>the other land form that we often see on<br>Rock Coast isn't just the Sea Cliff but<br>also this feature a Shore platform so<br>this uh level flat Bedrock surface<br>they're typically inter tidal so this<br>photo is at low tide high tide comes up<br>and the surface is covered by the Sea so<br>waves can move across it uh and help<br>erode The Cliff at the back the key<br>thing is that these are erosional<br>landforms and so the coastal erosion in<br>my title is covered by everything I talk<br>about tonight the important thing there<br>is that because they only erod their<br>trajectory into the future is Inland<br>these are not like beaches or mangroves<br>or coral reefs that can actually respond<br>dynamically to sea level rise and<br>climate change that can recover after<br>storms Rock coasts only a road so in<br>that way they're kind of actually more<br>vulnerable to climate change and sea Lev<br>rise than the landforms that we<br>traditionally think of such as beaches<br>coral reefs or mangroves<br>uh but my interest has really has been<br>in trying to understand how this land<br>form evolves and changes through time<br>and of course I'm interested in what the<br>future of these kinds of coastal<br>Landscapes might be as sea levels rise<br>and as climates<br>change and Rocky again Shore platforms<br>are spectacular landforms they they're<br>widespread around the globe they come in<br>a variety of variations although the<br>simple form of a cliff and a platform is<br>consistent they have quite a bit of<br>variability in their width elevation for<br>example so this is one of the more<br>spectacular platforms I get to visit uh<br>this is in South Wales uh on the<br>Glamorgan Heritage Coast this platform<br>is about 300 meters wide uh it's a very<br>large and spectacular<br>landform now the the thing that we're<br>interested in is trying to understand<br>how these landforms come to be so<br>geomorphology is essentially about why<br>the Landscapes look the way they do what<br>are the processes that deol uh cause<br>those Landscapes to evolve and what<br>might the future of these Landscapes be<br>and that question about how these<br>Landscapes come to be has been with us<br>in the literature for a very very long<br>time in fact one of the world's most<br>famous Coastal geomorphologists none<br>other than Charles Darwin okay wrote<br>about rock<br>coasts he couldn't understand how the<br>sea could erode such resistant rock as<br>basss that he observed on St Helen<br>Island and and the Atlantic Ocean and he<br>posed the question how uh has all that<br>hard baled rock uh been eroded or Swept<br>Away by the Sea and that basic question<br>has been with us ever since we continue<br>to CH be challenged by this question New<br>Zealand's had a role in this uh this is<br>the uh mil Island we know as the old hat<br>because it looks like a hat uh in the in<br>the Bay of islands and an early<br>Geological Survey by Danna uh speculated<br>about the role of waves eroding uh the<br>be bedrock at some level of greatest<br>wear somewhere around the mid tide<br>level later a New Zealand geologist<br>bartrum reappraised the the old hat and<br>said no no it's not about wave erosion<br>actually the waves are very weak here<br>it's really about the weathering of the<br>rock the sub Arial processes wetting and<br>drying salt weathering uh that weakened<br>The Rock to the point that you only need<br>very weak waves to remove um uh the the<br>the withered debris and so set up a<br>debate that's been in the literature for<br>for well over a 100 years now waves<br>versus weathering what is the process<br>responsible for these landforms and it's<br>continued to be a an issue and an<br>argument amongst geologists even as<br>recently uh Dave Kennedy and Mark Dixon<br>have uh have reappraised the old hat<br>trying to get to the answer of this<br>question so really that's what I've been<br>interested through my career is trying<br>to understand the processes responsible<br>for eroding rock cod<br>it might seem simple that it's either<br>waves or weering but when you want to<br>start making predictions about the<br>future of these kinds of coastlines you<br>really need to know uh what is the<br>relative role of those processes when<br>you're trying to build models to make<br>predictions so uh oh sorry and so<br>Darwin's handdrawn diagram eventually<br>gets into his book on the geology of<br>South America um uh uh as around this<br>question of of the sea eroding sea<br>Cliffs<br>um that basic question is what interests<br>me but before I get to that and talk<br>about how I've gone about answering that<br>here's the backstory this is a little<br>bit about me and where I'm from and now<br>what I really want to do is acknowledge<br>uh my uh my grandparents on both sides<br>of my family uh their stories I think<br>are really interesting and I've always<br>had enormous respect for my grandparents<br>I think of them as the war generation of<br>course they're no longer with us but<br>this photo is here's my grandmother<br>Maria and my grandfather Yan we knew him<br>as John uh but this is a photo from<br>about 1946 maybe early 47 grandfather<br>there is wearing a British army uniform<br>he spent uh five years serving for the<br>British army after World War II but<br>during World War II uh both him and my<br>grandmother were slave laborers laborers<br>in Germany and had a pretty traumatic<br>time of it at the end of their service<br>uh my grandfather's service they<br>immigrated here to New Zealand uh they<br>came out into Wellington on a ship<br>called helenic prince helenic prince TOA<br>okay and here's my grandfather is a<br>carpenter and a handyman working on the<br>white Tei power scream uh scheme in the<br>50s um unfortunately my grandmother's<br>wartime experience uh left her uh<br>suffering quite significant mental<br>illness issues she didn't cope very well<br>with the move to New Zealand the<br>marriage unfortunately uh ended and my<br>grandfather moved on and created a<br>blended family here in denan he spent<br>most of his his life working as a<br>handyman and as a carpenter in<br>dened on my father's side dad's from<br>kitan and this is a photo that there<br>were actually Four Stevensons in this<br>photo I'm very proud of this one uh this<br>is the volunteer fireade in 61 as we can<br>see there's my grandfather Jack<br>Stevenson his brother Uncle Joe his<br>other brother Uncle Alie and there's a<br>young Bill William Stevenson my father<br>okay and of course they were all coal<br>miners okay and my my grandmother's<br>father was a coal miner as well so<br>there's an r in there I think in terms<br>of where I am now uh thinking about<br>climate change and sea level rise dad's<br>interest in firefighting took us to<br>Christ Church uh he joined the Royal New<br>Zealand Air Force I was born here in in<br>green iseland when I was in 74 we moved<br>to Christ Church dad joined the Royal<br>New Zealand Air Force as a fireman and I<br>grew up in and around Christ wilgram Air<br>Force Base uh that mean I went to Hornby<br>high<br>and I was not in any way an academic<br>student uh somehow and for reasons I<br>never really understood uh in 1986 they<br>put me on the cover of the school<br>magazine uh and now some of I've<br>included the other image here because I<br>appreciate some people in the audience<br>won't remember the young<br>ones but I loveed the young ones I<br>thought it was such a cool program and I<br>was thrilled to be Rick because I liked<br>Rick I liked his Anarchist views of the<br>world I liked his anti-establishment<br>views his anti-authority views and some<br>of you who know me will Now understand<br>where my own politic comes<br>from I wasn't successful at school in<br>fact one year uh the dean of uh the S<br>formed Dean uh who was the head of<br>geography at uh Hornby High said<br>Stevenson you're nobody going<br>nowhere uh and well well Mr<br>Duffy here we are<br>I enjoyed Sports at school I played<br>rugby and I guess ultimately that's<br>where my interest now in running comes<br>from I was not good at rugby I spent<br>more time carrying the oranges than I<br>did the rugby ball uh but you know some<br>lifelong friendships and relationships<br>here this is my brother-in-law Roger<br>Okay so we've been brother-in-law now<br>for 20 nearly 29 years there's me with<br>some long hair and there's one Kevin<br>seals standing in the<br>background hey we've done all right<br>P beh High we moved on to uh University<br>of canbury K and I went to University of<br>canbury um and as I was said earlier<br>that's where I first met Bob Kirk and<br>was influenced by an inspired to do uh<br>physical geography in my particularly my<br>masters but then my PhD and so for my<br>PhD I returned to Kora was sorry I came<br>to kaiora for my PhD K and I had been<br>going to Kora for years before to go<br>scuba diving<br>so I went there uh and to do my PhD and<br>I was basically interested in this<br>question of ways versus weathering you<br>know what are the processes responsible<br>for creating a big wide Shore platform<br>like<br>this now uh the that work that I started<br>was built off work that Bob Kirk had<br>started 20 years before me and uh I like<br>this photo this is Bob uh from some<br>years ago now uh this is a a colleague<br>and a friend John Allen we did our phds<br>together look I think that I my joke<br>here is you know behind every successful<br>academic there's a PhD student pushing<br>really<br>hard okay and I'm going to keep that<br>going I think when I show you some of<br>the work of more recent work Bob set up<br>a monitoring program at Kora on the<br>shore platforms trying to measure the<br>erosion rates he was interested in the<br>rates and speed of development uh of<br>these landforms he started that in 73<br>and 74 I went there in 93 and<br>reinvigorated the network that he<br>installed and that network was based<br>around what was then Cutting Edge<br>technology okay this is a micro erosion<br>meter it's a very cunning device if you<br>put three bolts in the rock surface you<br>can every time you come back and put the<br>instrument on the bolts you get the<br>exact same position and this particular<br>instrument at the top here you can get<br>three readings this one at the bottom<br>you can get 120 readings from and so<br>across these profiles on the platform<br>each these letterers and triangles we<br>installed these bolt sites and we would<br>go back Reg and remeasure and as the<br>surface goes down we record the<br>elevation of the rock surface through<br>time as the erosion proceeds this uh<br>this is a an instrument that takes 120<br>reading as I just said it meant you had<br>to spend hours collecting data and Karen<br>is well trained as an neem operator she<br>spent enormous amount of time during my<br>PhD helping me collect those data up<br>until 2016 the Kora earthquake uh we had<br>at the height of the monitoring 54 bolt<br>sites across these seven profiles we had<br>over 25,000 individual Point<br>measurements of of rock surfaces so we a<br>very large data set out of that though<br>uh lots of uh uh papers have followed<br>and I think this is probably the the<br>most important part of the me I refer it<br>as the EM the micro erosion meter<br>Network at Kora is that we've abled been<br>able to create a a very long record of<br>erosion rates and so original work that<br>Bob did was only measuring rates of<br>around two years in fact other studies<br>typically are of about two years and one<br>of the criticisms has always been that<br>that's a relatively short period of time<br>to measure erosion on a land form that<br>takes thousands of years so can you<br>really extrapolate the erosion rates so<br>we've been able to measure those bolt<br>sites after 20 30 and 43 years in 2016<br>and extend our certainty or our<br>understanding of those erosion rates at<br>least to decade scales and what we find<br>is that statistically the two years of<br>data is identical to the decadal length<br>so we've been we've got a little bit<br>more confidence in uh our ability to<br>extrapolate these data and I think it's<br>fair to say now Kor is recognized<br>internationally uh for the for the<br>length of its record of monitoring<br>erosion on<br>platforms now the platform erosion rates<br>is fine and you can learn some things<br>from it but it doesn't get at the heart<br>of that question about the relative<br>roles of waves and weathering the<br>question I had for my PhD is do waves<br>erode platforms and so I took a very<br>geomechanical approach to this where we<br>essentially went out and measured the<br>waves to calculate the forces that the<br>waves induce on the Rock surfaces we<br>calculated the strength or the<br>resistance of the rock just through some<br>geotechnical techniques and what we find<br>is we use a very simple relationship uh<br>where we say erosion will occur when the<br>wave forces exceed the resistance forces<br>of the rock okay that's when we see<br>erosion while if we Quantified resisting<br>force and wave Force at Kora what we<br>discovered is that the forces induced by<br>the waves are nowhere near the resisting<br>force of the rock orders of magnitude<br>less okay so how could waves how could<br>waves be responsible for eroding these<br>uh Shore<br>platforms the other part of that story<br>of course is the withering and so we uh<br>we looked at the Wither weing we tried<br>to work out how efficient the weathering<br>was so particularly wetting and drying<br>and salt weathering in this<br>environment and so here's the same Rock<br>from Kora after just 20 cycles of<br>wetting and drying and fresh water not<br>even salt water it basically fell fell<br>apart and we know from work on the<br>platforms that these surfaces can have<br>up to 400 cycles of wetting and drying<br>per year and so the argument has been<br>actually this is uh it's necessary to<br>have the weering of the surface so the<br>weak waves can remove the debris<br>produced by the weering and that's<br>exactly the same story that bartrum<br>proposed the idea or the theory that<br>bartrum proposed in uh 1916 so we very<br>much landed in the bartrum camp in the<br>waves versus weathering debate now my<br>interest in waves on Shore platforms has<br>continued through time and in fact what<br>I've uh more recently we've had work<br>been done on Wave trans formations on<br>platforms uh by Rafael kry Mariani for<br>his PhD ref's done an amazing job he has<br>one of the most detailed data sets uh on<br>Wave Transformations across platforms<br>ever collected and it's a credit to ra<br>for the all the hard work he did and<br>it's a little I know it's a little it's<br>a cliche each of these little gray<br>squares is an instrument measuring water<br>level measuring waves Raph was uh<br>cunningly able to use some very cool<br>math to calculate what was happening to<br>the waves not just at the instruments<br>but between them as well so he's built<br>up this really complex picture of wave<br>hydrodynamics on on Shore platforms that<br>really has changed the way we understand<br>wave Transformations across these<br>surfaces the coloring is just the<br>dissipation of energy hot red is higher<br>energy lower energy in the blue but<br>importantly RH was able to show not just<br>the cross Shore um change of wave energy<br>which is what people have been focused<br>on uh but he was also able to illustrate<br>the alongshore variability as well<br>that's largely determined by the<br>morphology or the shape of the shore<br>platform and R pushed me really hard<br>okay and uh but one of the things I like<br>to to do is claim that I've got some<br>happy PhD candidates ref gone on to um<br>work for the denan city council and has<br>now just taken up a post-doctoral<br>fellowship at scrips Institute of<br>oceanography uh in San Diego so he<br>hasn't had to rely on Plan B okay he he<br>he he got it he's got he's doing really<br>well there was a move to Australia after<br>the PHD work and and lots of things<br>happened in Australia one of the things<br>I was able to do when I went to<br>Melbourne uh was pick up a micro erosion<br>media Network that had been installed in<br>1979 by Edmund Gil mostly around Laur on<br>on The Great Ocean Road uh along the<br>otways here he had uh done exactly the<br>same thing that Bob had done at kakura<br>and we were able to find the bolt sites<br>again I was able to find his instrument<br>and I actually even managed to find his<br>handwritten notes uh and original data<br>so we could recalculate and remeasure um<br>almost 95% of the bolts that he<br>installed and what we found is the<br>erosion rate over 32 years uh was just<br>slightly less than the erosion rate over<br>two years but still statistically the<br>same so again we had confirmation that<br>decadal rates and 2year rates are the<br>same so we can extend shorter term<br>erosion rates at least to the decade or<br>scale so that was quite useful that<br>work's been picked up and carried on by<br>ranie Yuan for his first his master's<br>thesis and then his PhD and Ran's done a<br>fantastic job he's an absolute machine<br>with the Publications um I've reduced<br>the supervisors to eel tonight because<br>these these I put these up to celebrate<br>the efforts of the students not not not<br>me or or the<br>co-supervisors uh Ran's done lots of<br>work measuring the bolt sites uh<br>regularly he's also done lots of<br>controlled experiments in the lab with<br>an environment cabinet controlling<br>temperature and moisture and water uh<br>Heating and Cooling and has been able to<br>isolate those different sub Arial<br>weathering processes out to see how they<br>cause erosion so Ran's done a great job<br>he's now in a Lector ship at the<br>University of Melbourne so another<br>success<br>story there's a slight shift now I I<br>alongside that work in Australia I began<br>work working in uh the UK with our<br>colleague um Lissa nayor and I'm not<br>sure if Lissa is online at the moment<br>but hi Lissa if you are um Lissa and I<br>met at a conference many years ago and<br>started talking about erosion of shore<br>Platforms in Rocky coast and<br>particularly the use of the micro<br>erosion meter we had doubts about the<br>validity of that method particularly the<br>scale at which you measure you measured<br>a very small scale but Lissa knew from<br>her PhD work that the platforms that she<br>had been working on don't come apart at<br>the millimeter or the submillimeter<br>scale they come apart at the meter scale<br>and that's because the site that she<br>worked on the geology uh was a series of<br>layered Limestone with thin layers of<br>shale in between tightly jointed and so<br>when it eroded It produced Big Blocks of<br>rock uh not small fine grains that I'd<br>been seeing at Kora in Australia so we<br>started playing around with this idea of<br>geological contingency that uh and this<br>has comes out of Jonathan Phillips<br>theoretical work that says general<br>models for landscape Evolution fall down<br>at the local scale because of local<br>factors and they're contingent on<br>History processes and geology so we<br>started comparing erosion uh products at<br>Glamorgan with Australia and Kora and<br>what we found of course is that the<br>geology is in control here it determines<br>the scale at which the erosion occurs<br>and it's because of the tightly jointed<br>Limestone the the joints wither okay and<br>they wither quite well and you can see<br>it when they fall apart it's a there's<br>actually a pool here like one of these<br>pools and the brown colors that you see<br>going down the face of the joint are is<br>the weathering down that joint and a lot<br>of it's done by the biology but that<br>weathering weakens The Joint to the<br>point where the waves suddenly are able<br>to pick up the blocks of rock and move<br>them<br>away this was interesting because people<br>had been putting micro erosion meters on<br>the surfaces of these layers of<br>limestone uh but we were seeing uh<br>blocks of rock literally been Stripped<br>Away in single storm events entire<br>layers of the<br>Limestone but you still needed the<br>weathering in the joints to enable the<br>waves to do that so again we're talking<br>about bartrums weathering necessary for<br>the erosion by waves of the rock we SP<br>and more recent work Daniel back<br>did this for her Masters she uh did this<br>in a much larger scale and was able to<br>calculate erosion rates and found that<br>the erosion rates were in fact or an<br>order of magnitude higher than the micro<br>erosion meter rates that have been<br>measured here so there's a question<br>around the validity of micro erosion<br>meter 25 years of of research and I'm<br>thinking maybe I've been doing it wrong<br>for all this time but there are there<br>are still really important questions<br>around scale in geomorphology and<br>particular particularly in the<br>measurement of erosion on these Rocky<br>coasts okay that gets me back to Kora<br>okay so there was a move back to we came<br>to dened in 2010 uh and of course um the<br>earthquake in<br>2016 there's always been an interest in<br>the question about the role of tectonics<br>and Rock Coast Evolution we've known<br>pretty well that there's a there's a<br>role here but the opportunities to<br>observe the immediate impacts of an<br>earthquake and particularly Co seismic<br>uplift of the coast are relatively rare<br>they're not unheard of Darwin had an<br>opportunity on The Voyage of the beagle<br>to do that observed our shorelines a few<br>years after an earthquake but what is<br>rare is to have a site uplifted where<br>you have 43 years of data and I think<br>that's where I got lucky I I literally<br>won the geomorphology lottery in terms<br>of this earthquake so we were able to go<br>to koraa and think about these surfaces<br>and what does tectonism what does uplift<br>during an earthquake do uh to those<br>processes that we've been investigating<br>and those rates of erosion that we've<br>been<br>measuring we also can now link to<br>another branch of of the earth sciences<br>and that's the Paleo seismic uh uh work<br>that geologists do when you uplift a a<br>Shore platform out of the tide uh like<br>uh like that one you create Marine<br>Terraces and this is a photo from the<br>work of Calin Berman at gns science this<br>is Mahia Peninsula up in the north<br>Ireland there's a modern Shaw platform<br>in the front here but behind that is a<br>series of terraces of a staircase of<br>terraces and each of these surfaces that<br>you can see here we can date those we<br>can look at the elevation of them and<br>this is what the Paleo seismic people do<br>you can calculate the return interv and<br>the magnitude of the earthquakes that uh<br>created those Marine Terraces and these<br>are these are Global these features you<br>can find them in lots of places and lots<br>of people use them to construct paleo<br>seismic<br>records the thing though is uh the if<br>the uplift is the right amount and if<br>the shore platform remains connected to<br>the Sea the shore platform continues to<br>develop and so the processes of the<br>shore platform widening erods the new<br>newest Marine Terrace and eventually<br>what you can do is you can actually<br>remove the last Marine Terrace from the<br>record and so if you go to marah here<br>and you met four Terraces how do you<br>know there wasn't a fifth Terrace how do<br>you know that if there's one missing or<br>maybe two missing so that's one of the<br>problems that we've been able to start<br>investigating uh through a Marsden<br>funded project uh that has allowed us to<br>look at Mahia and Kora as the end<br>members of the story Mahi is the end of<br>the life of a marine Terrace and uh Kora<br>is the beginning of a um Marine Terrace<br>and of course it is because of the 2016<br>earthquake uh it's not that long it's<br>still relatively fresh in the memory of<br>some people of course we know M 7.8 on<br>14th November<br>2016 significant seismic event for New<br>Zealand um this is where we get to be in<br>one of those hard places and this is uh<br>this is interesting as a g olist<br>watching the images on TV I couldn't<br>wait to get to Kora I just wanted to get<br>up there and see what had happened but<br>of course Kora is a community of people<br>who have been traumatized and impacted<br>badly by that earthquake we know about<br>the damage to uh State Highway 1 the<br>main trun line just getting to kakur in<br>the in the early weeks after the<br>earthquake was a major challenge uh two<br>of my three favorite pubs in Kora were<br>destroyed okay and of course the impacts<br>on the coastline as well now I I made a<br>promise to some people I wouldn't tell<br>very many running stories tonight so<br>here's my one and only running story I'm<br>uh and it really goes to this idea about<br>what it means to be a researcher going<br>into a community traumatized by<br>earthquake in 2018 I was running the den<br>uh the Christ Church marathon and um<br>it's a short run and um I got talking to<br>the woman alongside me you tend to do<br>that when you're running it helps the C<br>TI away and we we were running through<br>avide which was by that stage just empty<br>lots uh grown over with weeds the houses<br>had been removed uh the streets were<br>still sort of paved but pretty bad shape<br>and I made the comment this is a really<br>depressing course to be on for a<br>marathon and she said I used to live<br>here and it turned out she was a teacher<br>I think at avide girls high she her<br>house had been destroyed her job she had<br>lost a job her husband had lost his job<br>and she was telling me all this and<br>think oh this is awful and then she said<br>to me what do you<br>do and I said wow I'm interested in<br>earthquakes and I'm studying Kora and<br>I'm looking at the uplift that was<br>caused by that earthquake and I'm trying<br>to understand what the future of that<br>Coastline might be and she said to me<br>that's really interesting you're so<br>earthquake I I didn't have anything to<br>say at that point but but the point is<br>as earth scientists as geographers Geist<br>whatever our discipline is when we work<br>on De disasters and Hazards working with<br>those communities and being in those<br>communities is often quite hard because<br>you are in amongst people traumatized uh<br>by those events I if there's any message<br>in here tonight and I know this won't be<br>used to to to the folk I'm talking about<br>but just being mindful of the<br>communities you're working in at Kora<br>the whole Peninsula came up a whole me<br>it came up a meter further north it was<br>up to 6 M further south it was actually<br>subsidence but the peninsula itself<br>popped up a meter and that means those<br>profiles or our micro erosion meter bolt<br>sites on it were now many of those sites<br>were now supertide or they were above<br>the tide they were no longer uh Shore<br>platforms they were now brand new Marine<br>Terraces and the platform the profiles<br>that you see some of them were made much<br>longer seaf floor came up from being<br>subtitle to be an intertitle uh and so<br>the landscape changed dramatically the<br>uh the the hold fast so the dilia here<br>and the white that's that was all<br>subtitled before the earthquake just to<br>illustrate the amount of<br>uplift and here's the beginning of a<br>brand new Marine Terrace so here's a<br>site uh just a few weeks after the Kora<br>earthquake this is a gravel Beach this<br>is where high tide used to be before the<br>earthquake this is the high tide on the<br>day I took the photo this was inter tial<br>Shore platform it's now a brand new<br>Marine Terrace and over time we've had<br>the opportunity to observe uh and record<br>the accumulation of sediment and the<br>development of this Marine Terrace so<br>this the the the Rocks began to weather<br>the waves still some waves were able to<br>wash in uh seaweed and Driftwood the<br>plants moved in and now what remember<br>that used to be inter tidal it's now a<br>piece of land with grass grin on it and<br>it is what we recognize as a marine<br>Terrace the other thing we were able to<br>do of course was begin was continue<br>measuring the bolt sites these micro<br>erosion meter bolt sites so this is this<br>one of these sites just a few weeks<br>after the earthquake in December 2016<br>and here it is in December<br>2023 now the important Point here is<br>that you can see the accumulation of the<br>weather Dey on the surface the surface<br>continued to wither okay the mudstone<br>kind of contracted and cracked and broke<br>down and produced all these<br>fragments the important point is there<br>are no waves anymore so that withered<br>debris is not being washed away as<br>bartrum described it should be so again<br>another little piece of evidence and<br>support of bartram's view of withering<br>and the removal of debris by weak waves<br>when you stop the wave the debris<br>accumulates because the weathering<br>processes go on they're not as efficient<br>or as fast the weaing dry Cycles are<br>much reduced but the rock surface is<br>still<br>withering now I'm actually here's some<br>finally I've got some data to show you<br>it's been a long time coming if we uh<br>we've been able to measure these Bol<br>sites month uh sorry quarterly uh since<br>2016 subject to covid restrictions<br>there's a few gaps um but if we actually<br>look at some data each of those each of<br>these panels is one of the profiles or<br>the seven profiles and each of the lines<br>is one of the bolt sides and we've got<br>here elevation of the bolt site through<br>time from uh 16 at the start up to<br>December 2023 and you can see the<br>general story is the surface continuing<br>to lower as we might expect the gray<br>envelopes are actually the pre-<br>earthquake rates okay so this is the<br>range of rates we had on the bolt site<br>before the earthquake so if nothing had<br>changed we would expect these lines to<br>be inside the gray envelopes but as you<br>can see many of them are not they've uh<br>actually lowering much faster some of<br>them are still within those envelopes<br>but uh they've moved their positions<br>some of towards the bottom but actually<br>some of the SES have actually uh the<br>surface elevation has increased and<br>that's the accumulation of that<br>withering uh withered Deery that's not<br>been removed on these super tidal bolt<br>sites that are on the new Marine Terrace<br>and in fact they dropped out of the out<br>of the record pretty quickly because<br>basically the bolt site became buried we<br>could no longer find it under the debris<br>that was accumulating the sediment that<br>was accumulating we've lost a few bolt s<br>sits uh the bols with the erosion rates<br>have been quite High have simply dropped<br>out uh but overall our erosion rate data<br>pre- earthquake in the gray here and<br>post earthquake in the red here is<br>significantly different okay the rates<br>are are really different from uh uh<br>before the earthquake compared to after<br>the earthquake that might not seem as a<br>surprise um but it's uh it is<br>demonstrating the impact of the<br>earthquake on these erosion rates again<br>a busy table uh what we've got here is<br>uh each of the seven profiles with we've<br>averaged all the bolt sites together to<br>come up with the profile average and<br>then at the bottom we've got the average<br>of the seven profiles these first two<br>numbers are the erosion rates before the<br>earthquake and these numbers are the<br>erosion rates after the earthquake on<br>the anniversary uh of of the earthquake<br>and what you see of course is that the<br>erosion rates have more than doubled<br>since the<br>earthquake why does that matter well if<br>you think about that meter of uplift<br>since the earthquake the platforms have<br>come up a meter at those rates of<br>erosion of two to 2 and a half<br>millimeters per year you only need about<br>450 years to erode that uplifted surface<br>it's a very simple linear calculation I<br>know but I haven't got time to go into<br>the<br>details but the the point is if it only<br>takes 450 years to remove that uh Marine<br>terus that new Marine terce it isn't in<br>the landscape for very long and it turns<br>out the return interval of earthquakes<br>at Kora is around 700 years so it's<br>quite conceivable the new Marine Terrace<br>we observe today will be gone from the<br>landscape before the next earthquake<br>which means the the geomorphic record in<br>the geological record of the 2016<br>earthquake could well disappear and so<br>that's the message that we're sort of uh<br>promoting at the moment the geologists<br>kind of know that there's a chance that<br>they might not have all the Marine<br>Terraces but actually now having be able<br>to put a some numbers on the rates of of<br>and how quickly these things erode or<br>disappear has been quite useful so our<br>future work is really around trying to<br>uh better uh refine that model to<br>predict how long Marine Terrace has last<br>in the landscape part of that story<br>isn't just based on the measurements<br>that I've made with the mem it's also<br>based around the work that some of the<br>PHD candidates in the project have done<br>as well so here's Sophie Horton Sophie<br>was asked to look at the changing and<br>process cesses at Kora uh and she worked<br>at Kora and Mah here she's done some<br>great work uh examining how wave<br>Transformations have changed over the<br>platforms and importantly how the<br>weathering processes have changed on the<br>platforms as well so Sophie developed a<br>really cool little model for calculating<br>the number of wetting and drying Cycles<br>pre- earthquake and post<br>earthquake and it's riant really on the<br>change in inundation by the tide the<br>weather conditions but Sophie could show<br>us or did show us that pre-earthquake<br>those platforms could have up anything<br>up to 400 cycles per year post<br>earthquake though down to 20 or 30 so<br>the process regime has changed<br>dramatically as a result of that<br>earthquake and uh and so we've been able<br>to better understand those things and so<br>that better informs the models that we<br>are now using to predict the longevity<br>of marine<br>terrores happy PhD candidate I don't<br>know if you're watching Sophie but this<br>is your punishment for photobombing<br>uh my photo uh Sophie's now at<br>University of Canterbury in election<br>shle she's just moved to Canterbury<br>after a teaching position at Oxford<br>University I was trying to take a photo<br>of Joker Toler in the back bear uh and<br>Joker Toler was another student sorry<br>PhD candidate on our project Joka was<br>interested in understanding those<br>erosion rates that we've been measuring<br>with the micro erosion meter but mindful<br>of the problems that we knew about in<br>the micro erosion meter data and so<br>applied a new technique or a more recent<br>upto-date technique to try and measure<br>the erosion rates so Joker TOA spent<br>hours hunched over bolt sites taking<br>thousands and thousands of photos and<br>those photos uh analyzed with a<br>technique called structure for motion<br>photogrametry we basically create a<br>digital elevation model of the surface<br>from all the photographs we can repeat<br>that compare the uh the differences<br>between those models and calculate the<br>erosion rate over a much larger area<br>than just the micro erosion meter and so<br>uh Joker Toler did that at a much larger<br>scale than the than the mem the the<br>targets just helped um control the<br>photograph and Joker Toler could show us<br>that the erosion rates scale that is the<br>bigger the scale that you measure out<br>the bigger the erosion rates so that's<br>been quite an important outcome and we<br>see here uh the statistical differences<br>between erosion rates depending on the<br>scale that you've measured them at so in<br>blue is the micro erosion meter uh the<br>microscale is using the photog gretry on<br>the bolt site and then the misos scale<br>is using it over about a square meter<br>and the the photogrametry reveals the<br>scale of the erosion products the size<br>of their bits that are coming off the<br>surface uh and we've been able to see<br>that in great detail as well and again<br>these kind of data will go into the<br>numerical models that we use uh to<br>predict uh the future of these<br>landforms happy PhD candidates uh Joker<br>is now a senior Coastal scientist for<br>the Orland um Council uh just a shout<br>out this is Brendan Hall technician from<br>the University of Oakland who helped us<br>a lot of lot of the field<br>work okay I want to so I guess finish<br>with some uh some thank yous this is the<br>mden team I I've had the privilege of<br>working with some great people uh the<br>maren project I think it's perhaps one<br>of the longest running Mar in on record<br>uh we've had multiple extensions Co of<br>course but that's been in a way that's<br>been a bit of a silver lining because<br>it's really given us time to sit and<br>think about what we're doing and really<br>look in depth at our data so uh Kevin<br>Norton Victoria University Martin Hurst<br>at Glasgow University hero mitsumoto<br>he's our numerical modeler he's the one<br>doing all the really hard work now uh<br>that we've got all the data in uh Nicola<br>Lichfield uh gns science Nicola is our<br>seismologist our seismic person who<br>keeps the G morphology real uh and this<br>is Mark Dixon Oakland University my co-<br>Chief investigator Mark and I have had<br>some great time over the last few years<br>arguing about waves and weathering and<br>rates of erosion on Shore<br>platforms my biggest thanks has to go to<br>Karen<br>sorry uh here here we are in 94 I think<br>maybe 94 I can't remember exactly uh<br>Karen helping with my field work Karen<br>did spent hours and hours and hours at<br>Kora measuring all those Bol sides with<br>me uh here we are last year uh<br>effectively the 30th annivers of of<br>working at kakur and I'm not going to<br>make the obvious joke about Karen being<br>my rock okay because clearly the rocks<br>at Kora are not as supportive as stable<br>as Karen has been for the last Almost 29<br>years thank you<br>Karen I'm going to finish where I<br>started and that's in memory of<br>Bob Bob was a a DVC uh aead of school he<br>was a um<br>an awesome scientist but for me and to<br>me and to many people that Bob taught<br>over the years he was a teacher he was a<br>supervisor colleague collaborator Mentor<br>uh and of course<br>friend this is Bob doing fieldwork this<br>is Bob doing geology he happens to be on<br>the phone talking to the University of<br>Canterbury as the DVC uh manager so I<br>like this he's man here he is managing<br>the University of Canterbury from the<br>from a Shore platform at Kore<br>um this quote is actually from the<br>acknowledgements of my PhD I wrote in<br>1997 and one of the things about Bible<br>was he was very keen to see people be<br>given opportunity and that was mentioned<br>today in his memorial service as one of<br>the Hallmarks of his his time with us<br>I've always been grateful to Bob for the<br>opportunity he gave me and I will always<br>you<br>man oroi um it's my great pleasure as<br>the provice chancellor of the division<br>in which Wayne Works division of<br>humanities to offer a vote of thanks to<br>Wayne um and I think you probably all<br>agree that in this lecture we have um<br>seen the display of scholarship at work<br>and that it looks like observing things<br>testing hypotheses being prepared to<br>make space for factors you had initially<br>expected and then following a new line<br>of research um and of course you blessed<br>us with or privileged US with some data<br>which and I'm smiling because we don't<br>get that in all of our humanities<br>lectures so it was lovely thank you<br>Wayne um I think too I want to<br>acknowledge and thank you that you have<br>um made a point of supporting PhD<br>students in your research and that's<br>clearly important to you um in your IPL<br>you showed that clearly and it's<br>wonderful to see how many of them have<br>gone on to become researchers in their<br>own rights and it's a really important<br>part of what we do as researchers here<br>um and finally that you do it with<br>colleagues um colleagues are obviously<br>an important part of your work and again<br>a nice reminder to us that we're not<br>here on solo Endeavors we're here<br>listening to working with and<br>researching with others um and lovely<br>that you're able to do that also with<br>Karen all the way through so really nice<br>um I also want to acknowledge um the<br>work you do for us at a divisional level<br>um in administration and management I<br>think it's worth adding that in and in a<br>vote of thanks to on an IPL um and I'm<br>I'm really grateful that while your<br>career research-wise is all about<br>waiting for walls to fall down and<br>measuring erosion um I'm thankful that<br>you do the<br>opposite in your roll us and Division<br>and that is that you're trying to find<br>ways to make things better and work<br>better for our students and our staff<br>and so want to acknowledge all of the<br>work that you've done as associate do<br>Graduate Studies um and that building up<br>that you do of us um and we will wait<br>and see how that MAA works out thank you<br>Wayne so um I get to end by<br>congratulating you<br>so Wayne Stevenson Professor Wayne<br>Stevenson it is a title welld deserved<br>and it's a thrill for us to be here and<br>celebrate that with you and I also want<br>to say a thank you to all of you who are<br>here with us in person and those who
