everyone I'm Richard<br>Blakey I'm Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>research and Enterprise it's my great<br>privilege and pleasure to host you<br>tonight this is a time where we<br>acknowledge the contributions uh we make<br>as a university through our professorate<br>as our academic leaders we set very high<br>standards for professorial appointment<br>or promotion uh requiring evidence of<br>sustained excellence and Leadership<br>across all areas academic life research<br>teaching and service you'll hear tonight<br>of the important research crits LED on<br>the Dynamics of marine and polar<br>ecosystems that are so important in the<br>critical times of climatic and<br>environmental change that lie ahead for<br>us um the order of proceedings is that<br>Professor Barker the Prov Vice<br>Chancellor of Sciences will introduce um<br>crit's uh background and career in a bit<br>more detail and following the lecture<br>Mars Lamar as head of department will<br>summarize and give a vote of thanks<br>before welcome us to the staff Club but<br>I just want to add my own personal<br>thanks and acknowledgements briefly<br>first what is clear to everyone who gets<br>to know crit is the immense and<br>effective effort and passion you bring<br>to all you do and we are particularly<br>grateful for this I'd like to personally<br>thank you for your current service on<br>the University Research committee as<br>associate Dean research for the division<br>of Sciences where you are an<br>exceptionally effective advocate for<br>research and researchers during a time<br>of significant change and challenge I'd<br>also like to call out your amazing book<br>book project with otaga University press<br>because U press sits in the research<br>division where you took on the lockdown<br>project not to read lcks of books but to<br>produce an amazingly beautiful and<br>engaging book on beach combing on the S<br>seash shores of the Southern Hemisphere<br>we've had great feedback from our<br>publisher and the OU press team who uh<br>who helped you in this work and we know<br>that it's a very popular and good<br>selling volume and finally for me it's<br>clear that You' have been driven to<br>leadership throughout your career you<br>are for example the only person I know<br>who has gone to the world economic Forum<br>to represent their University and their<br>research within 10 years of receiving<br>their PHD so um I'm sure we'll hear more<br>about your achievements both from<br>Professor Barker and from yourself and<br>others uh so it's now my job to get out<br>of the way but to uh congratulate you on<br>behalf of your achievement on your your<br>well- earned promotion to the position<br>noooo Professor Blakey tqu Professor<br>Fraser tqu Deputy Vice chancellors Tena<br>Professor lame ten friends and<br>colleagues tenot tenot<br>tenot it is my great pleasure to<br>introduce our speaker tonight Professor<br>kedwin called kred Fraser from the<br>Department of Marine Science to give her<br>inaugural professorial lecture at the<br>University of otago as indicated by<br>Professor Blakey criid was promoted to<br>Professor in February this year and<br>tonight we get to celebrate the<br>significant achievement born in canra in<br>the Australian Capital territory<br>Professor Fraser began her award-winning<br>science career at Liam primary<br>school as an eight or nine-year-old she<br>won a primary school science using an<br>illuminated fish anatomy<br>display in a nice touch when she won the<br>uh act scientist the year in 2016 the<br>minister gave the speech and presented<br>the award in the Hall of her old primary<br>school she decided about the age of 11<br>to become a marine biologist influenced<br>by the great sir David<br>atanur just as a generation earlier<br>self-included were inspired by jacqu<br>custo and as Underwater World these<br>experience has highlight the huge<br>influence that science communicators<br>have after all cber is not noted for its<br>marine<br>environment after completing her<br>schooling and inspired by penguins and<br>Wales Professor Fraser headed off to the<br>University of CRA where she studied for<br>a bachelor of applied science and then<br>on to mcari for a bachelor of Marine<br>Science with honors graduating in<br>2005 for reasons I suspect she might let<br>on on her talk but one suggestion might<br>be that thinking she now really needed<br>to experience a first class University<br>she crossed the ditch and enrolled in a<br>PhD at<br>otago studying kelp rafting in the<br>Southern Ocean graduating in 2009 and<br>jointly supervised by professors Hamish<br>Spencer who I saw in the audience<br>earlier yes and John Waters the back<br>both with us crd's PhD was followed by<br>two post postdoctoral positions firstly<br>in the Wilson Center Herod oaro from<br>2009 to 2011 and then at univers lib de<br>brel in Belgium from 2011 to<br>2012 feeling the call home Professor<br>Fraser commenced her academic career as<br>a lecturer at the Australian National<br>University in 2012 and while there she<br>moved through the academic ranks to<br>professor then finally cross the ditch<br>back here professor at the University of<br>otago just over a decade after starting<br>her academic career who rise through the<br>academic ranks has been truly<br>impressive as Professor Blakey has noted<br>promotion to full professor at the<br>University of Oto is far from easy one<br>must excel in each of the three academic<br>domains of research teaching and service<br>and Professor Fraser personifies<br>Excellence firstly she is a productive<br>and award-winning researcher crit has<br>published two books including the<br>lockdown project that we just heard<br>about Beach coming a guide to sea horses<br>of the Southern Hemisphere sorry SE<br>me six book chapters 79 referee Journal<br>articles and some of the top scientific<br>journals including the proceedings of<br>the National Academy of Sciences nature<br>and the Journal of the Royal Society<br>series B she has secured significant<br>grant funding both here in Australia and<br>in New Zealand 4.7 million in total a<br>little a little under half of that here<br>in New Zealand including as a a um<br>principal investigator on a 2021 maren<br>Grant a 2019 ruford Discovery<br>fellow an Australian research Council<br>Council Discovery Fellowship in 2018 an<br>Australian research Council future<br>Fellowship in<br>2017 and an Australian research Council<br>Discovery early career research award in<br>2014<br>this is all the while taking out time to<br>be a mother of two children apparently<br>bad sleepers while babies which must<br>have just added to the significant<br>challenge Professor Fraser's research is<br>largely focused on global bi<br>biogeographic processes and patterns<br>especially in the Antarctic and the<br>Southern Ocean environment This research<br>has been<br>award-winning she was the act act<br>scientist the year in 2016 theu<br>representative at the world economic<br>forum and daros as we heard was awarded<br>the Phantom medal for early career<br>research distinction by the Australian<br>Academy of Science in 2018 she was added<br>to the Australian Capital territories<br>woman's honor role in 2018 to<br>acknowledge and celebrate outstanding<br>achievements of woman and Cambra she<br>received the 2019 MacArthur and Wilson<br>award from the international biog<br>biogeography Society a recognition of<br>early to mid-career research noted for<br>its innovative contribution to<br>biogeography and she won the phological<br>Society of America Award for best paper<br>in the Journal of picology in<br>2021 much of Professor Fraser's<br>Publications Feature work that's been<br>published in conjunction with her<br>graduate students which brings me to the<br>second domain of teaching since<br>commencing her her lecturing career ATU<br>she has maintained a pattern of stepping<br>into and out of significant research<br>fellowships but despite these Comm<br>commitments she has cons continued to<br>teach and to supervise postgraduate<br>students to date she supervised three<br>PhD students to completion and is<br>currently supervising seven and you'll<br>be interested to know that her<br>Rutherford Fellowship is a 0.85 FTE<br>research finding the time to teach and<br>supervise is true<br>commitment not only does she maintain a<br>high super load she also acts as course<br>coordinator for third-year marine<br>science paper and teaches into several<br>papers across the marine and ecology<br>programs unsurprisingly her teaching has<br>also had external recognition she has<br>been made a fellow of the higher<br>education Academy recognition for her<br>expertise in t tertiary teaching the<br>third domain in which academics must<br>excel in order to gain promotion here at<br>Oto is service to the professional and<br>academic communities and in this<br>Professor Fraser is also a star she was<br>elected as academic representative on<br>the University Council the Australian<br>National University in 2018 here at<br>otaro was on the vice Chancellor search<br>Focus Group in 2020 and 2021 she's been<br>on the maren fund panel of experts<br>assessing Grant applications she's been<br>on a an MB Endeavor proposal<br>assessor she was on the Australian<br>Academy of Science panel for fenel fenna<br>medal Awards and in 2021 she's been an<br>Antarctica New Zealand panelist for<br>scholarship Awards convenor of the<br>University of otago research grants Life<br>Sciences panel and on the editorial<br>board as a science representative for<br>the otaga University and just to make<br>sure she has rung everything out of the<br>0.15 Ft left over from the ruford<br>discovery Fellowship crud is the<br>associate Dean research for the division<br>of Sciences and a member of the<br>University Research<br>committee thank you for the that service<br>but now I think you've heard enough from<br>me and it's time to hear from Professor<br>Fraser herself one of our Stellar women<br>in scien here at otaro please join me in<br>welcoming Professor CR<br>Fraser Professor Blakey T Professor Baka<br>T Deputy Vice chancellors T miles T<br>sorry Professor<br>lame thank you all so much for coming<br>tonight um and thank you very much for<br>those um humbling um introductions<br>with which translates as clear away the<br>undergrowth so the new flex shoots can<br>grow and I think this Ki speaks to<br>a lot of um the the research Focus that<br>I have um maintained over the last years<br>looking at how biodiversity changes<br>through time and how disturbance to one<br>area can create opportunities for growth<br>and change in other areas so I want to<br>talk to you today about how disturbance<br>and dispersal interact to drive<br>Evolution and patterns of biodiversity<br>across the world but let me start by<br>introducing myself a little more<br>so<br>DEA Co Alex<br>like sorry I really like this um geneal<br>genealogical way of introducing um in<br>Mii but particularly at an IPL it made<br>me stop and reflect where I've come from<br>and the people who have influenced who I<br>am and in a way I was surprised to<br>discover that on both sides of my family<br>I have quite a lot of academic Heroes I<br>think they were there all the time and I<br>knew about them but I didn't consciously<br>recognize necessarily how influential<br>they had been on my father's side my<br>grandfather Malcolm Fraser did a PhD at<br>Oxford um in physics and worked for some<br>time at Oxford before taking a senior<br>lectureship at University of Sydney my<br>father Donald worked um did his PhD at<br>a&amp;u and worked as an academic for most<br>of his career at the Australian Defense<br>Force Academy which is now part of<br>unsw my Uncle Robin might be known to<br>some of you he was a professor here at<br>atago although based at the Christ<br>Church campus and he was a character<br>that you would never forget if you met<br>him um he died a few months ago and his<br>memorial will be um in October at Christ<br>Church also my uncle who's not really an<br>uncle but is really an uncle um Martin<br>Elias had a PhD in electrical<br>engineering so a lot of the the male<br>figures in my family had um a history of<br>academic uh<br>achievement on my mother's side too I<br>think one of the most influential people<br>was my grandmother Joan crockford Bey<br>and she was one of the earliest people<br>to get a PhD or DSC in geology in<br>Australia unfortunately because it was<br>1940s 1950s she wasn't really able to<br>follow a research career once she got<br>married um but she remained passionate<br>about science throughout her life and<br>was probably the person I heard speaking<br>science to me most growing up her<br>gravestone celebrates her scientific<br>focus and in fact she has three um Brio<br>and species named after her engraved on<br>her<br>gravestone my grand my grandfather<br>George um had a degree in minerology and<br>became a minor and his son Andrew um got<br>a PhD and worked as a professor at the<br>University of Western um Sydney so both<br>sides of my family have many academics<br>my mother too although she didn't do a<br>pH PhD or higher degree she did start a<br>degree in Earth and environment science<br>and cared passionately about it and<br>passed that on to us as children I had a<br>very privileged childhood and um I was<br>very fortunate in that we met we went<br>even though we lived in CRA which as<br>Richard pointed out is quite landlocked<br>every summer we spent weeks down at the<br>south coast of New South Wales and I<br>would spend all my time poking around in<br>rock pools picking up shells and<br>wondering at the marine life when I was<br>four I fell in love with penguin and<br>that passion followed me forever um at<br>one point we did a census of my bedroom<br>because once people know you like<br>something they start giving it to you um<br>and Penguins there's a lot of penguin<br>stuff around I had more than 1,000<br>penguin objects or pictures in my room<br>when I was 12 but it was when I was 11<br>and we lived for a while in America that<br>a science teacher there had a fish tank<br>at the back and he had this amazing<br>flatworm in the fish tank and I would<br>spend hours just staring at the<br>beautiful swimming of the flatworm so I<br>decided there and then I'm going to be a<br>marine biologist when I grew<br>up but people advised me don't do marine<br>biology there's no jobs in it all the<br>Marine scientists students in the room<br>don't listen to them it's not true but I<br>listen to them and I thought all right<br>if I shouldn't do marine biology what<br>would I do so I combined my other<br>interests of um history and art and did<br>a degree in the conservation of cultural<br>materials at the University of CRA I<br>worked in archives and libraries and<br>museums for a while but I found that<br>every weekend I was still just driving<br>down to the coast and poking around in<br>rock pools so after I had a degree that<br>would get me a job I went and did one<br>that apparently wouldn't get me a job um<br>so I started a degree in Marine Science<br>at um James Cook University in<br>Townsville and what this taught me is<br>that I'm not suited to the tropics at<br>all so I don't like hot weather it's my<br>Scottish Heritage I couldn't COPE in<br>Townsville so halfway through the degree<br>I abandoned my scholarship and went down<br>to mcquarry University to finish my<br>Marine Science degree and I stayed on to<br>do honors at the Australian<br>Museum so my honors was my first foray<br>into science of disturbance I was um<br>with Pat picking up dredge samples in<br>botany bay in Sydney and we were looking<br>at the impacts of dredging on benic<br>assemblages after so benic PL animals<br>after dredging had happened to build a<br>new runway for the<br>airport sorry just going back to that<br>this um photo of me covered in mud um<br>also taught me that the best way to get<br>a seat on a train in Sydney is to be<br>really really stinky at peak hour um but<br>it was a wonderful time that honors year<br>and not only because I was learning cool<br>stuff and discovering the world of<br>research but also because I built great<br>relationships with Pat my honest<br>supervisor and my colleague Maria who<br>was also a big influence on my deciding<br>to go on in science and we we would go<br>out every weekend kaying and yachting<br>around the Hawks briest Pat had a really<br>nice house on the Hawks briest her<br>husband had had a yacht and many many<br>happy weekends spent drinking wine<br>yachting around picking up worms always<br>always picking up worms and sorting them<br>in our spare time you can see here a<br>very beautiful terab bellad worm um so<br>beautiful that recently I built some<br>leadlight windows um and I know Peter my<br>leadlight window teacher is here in the<br>audience somewhere up the back there um<br>more lead lights later but um we've<br>immortalized the worms in some lead<br>light windows that I gave to Pat and<br>Maria the animal that you see along the<br>bottom and side is a walking jellyfish<br>and this was actually the the subject of<br>my first academic paper it was a chance<br>finding Maria and I shared an office we<br>had a fish tank in the office we had a<br>sea slug called Pedro in the fish tank<br>and Pedro liked sea lettuce so we'd go<br>out every weekend and pick him some sea<br>lettuce from The Rock pools and one day<br>the fish tank was covered in tiny white<br>spots and we pulled some out and looked<br>under a microscope and it was these<br>incredible jellyfish that use suction<br>cups to walk around rather than swimming<br>as we think most jellyfish do um so we<br>wrote a paper on it we also did some<br>genetic analysis and found out that it<br>had come all the way from the<br>Mediterranean was a direct match for<br>populations in the Mediterranean so it<br>probably arrived by ballast water in<br>ships and it was a really it was my<br>first thinking about long-distance<br>dispersal and how animals and plants can<br>but um I found that Sydney having been<br>to Townsville and thought the tropics<br>was too hot I found that Sydney was also<br>too hot for me and so I asked my<br>lecturers where might I do a PhD where I<br>won't<br>overheat and someone suggested denan I'd<br>never heard of it before i' had never<br>even been to New Zealand but I flew over<br>for a weekend and fell in love forever<br>with denan I couldn't believe this town<br>existed it's exactly what I would have<br>designed if I was designing my dream<br>Town um so I was here for as Richard<br>said for my PhD in my first postdoc and<br>that was with John and HH my um amazing<br>supervisors and we and here we started<br>to dig deep into the concept of<br>longdistance dispersal and how plants<br>and animals get around so how do plants<br>and animals get around they can M they<br>can travel with migrating birds and<br>other animals so zalker that's an animal<br>carrying propag gills around so like a<br>seed could be attached to a bird leg and<br>fly with that bird long distances they<br>could be blown by storms Cyclones and<br>hurricanes could carry things long<br>distances but what we were really<br>focused on was Oceanic rafting how<br>things float at Sea and travel long<br>distances and in particular kelp but<br>long-distance dispersal and some of you<br>have seen this slide coming up in my<br>lectures um year after year I just can't<br>get rid of it long-distance dispersal is<br>a concept that scientists have<br>speculated on for a very long time<br>but have had trouble proving until<br>recently even Charles Darwin when he<br>wrote the Origin of Species said as far<br>as regards the occurrence of identical<br>species at points so enormously remote<br>As KGAN Land New Zealand and FIA I<br>believe that icebergs have been largely<br>concerned in their<br>dispersal that might sound far-fetched<br>but actually shortly after I started my<br>PhD an iceberg that had broken off in<br>the wedel sea came up past the atago<br>coast and those of you who are then here<br>then will remember the excitement this<br>caused that an iceberg was coming up<br>past denan you could see it from the<br>peninsula but annoyingly the Australians<br>flew a helicopter over and planted an<br>Australian flag on an iceberg in New<br>Zealand Waters so this caused outrage<br>and in response New Zealand flew the<br>most famous sh sheep Shrek over to the<br>iceberg had little crampons made for him<br>and they had a ceremonial shearing of<br>Shrek on the iceberg and thus reclaimed<br>it for New Zealand but this is a really<br>nice EX example of longdistance movement<br>of something at Sea so something's<br>floating and it can travel a long way<br>around the ocean but I spent most of my<br>PhD looking at this charismatic organism<br>not the seals but the much more exciting<br>kelp around it um it's Dil Antarctica or<br>rura it grows to up to 12 M long it's<br>very um you you all know it you live in<br>denan um it's an amazing species and it<br>occurs right around the southern<br>hemisphere in the sub Antarctic around<br>New Zealand and along the coast of South<br>America it floats really really well so<br>there's potential if it breaks off and<br>sets off in the Southern Ocean for it to<br>travel right around the southern<br>hemisphere it's also um important<br>potentially as a carrier of other<br>animals so this is the hold fast of the<br>kelp the basil bit that sticks onto the<br>Rock and it is home to many many other<br>species from um things like crabs and<br>worms and snails um sea stars all sorts<br>of things live inside the hold fust so<br>if the kelp breaks off it could carry<br>animals right across the ocean and when<br>I was shopping for a PhD John had this<br>idea to look at whether kelp could raft<br>and carry animals with it across oceans<br>so we started using genetics to do that<br>and we found some really nice evidence<br>that it happens um this is a photo<br>towards the end of my PhD in 2009 when I<br>stumbled on some super exciting kelp on<br>St Clair Beach and it was was exciting<br>because it was covered in Goose<br>barnicles and some species of goose<br>barnicles only grow on things that are<br>drifting at Sea so if you find something<br>on a beach that's covered in Goose<br>barnicles it's probably been drifting at<br>sea for quite a long time and doing<br>genetic analysis on this kelp that had<br>large Goose paricles we were able to<br>show that the kelp had traveled hundreds<br>of kilometers from the New Zealand sub<br>Antarctic and it still had live animals<br>in the hold fasts so this was really<br>nice evidence that kelp can carry<br>animals long distance at Sea I won't go<br>into um details here but we also using<br>genetics were able to infer that during<br>at the peak of the last ice age sea ice<br>around Antarctica wiped out populations<br>of bull kelp that were then able to<br>recolonize Drifting in the path of the<br>current so I finished my first postdoc<br>here and started to think about what to<br>do next and the advice I got was go to<br>the northern hemisphere you need<br>Northern Hemisphere experience so I<br>applied for and got a postto in Belgium<br>working on bark beetles my supervisor<br>was Jean Claude greguar and um given<br>that I was sick to death of field workor<br>down in the sub Antarctic where I got<br>wet and cold and beaten around um it was<br>quite luxurious to go and do fieldwork<br>in European forests jeanclaude always<br>chose his field sites to be as close as<br>possible to the best wine growing<br>regions in town and my memory of of<br>those field trips is that he always had<br>a basket and a baguette and a bottle of<br>wine and when I Was preparing this talk<br>I got clipart to give me a picture of<br>that but then I went to Jean claude's<br>website to get a picture of him to put<br>in here and I found that actually his<br>own picture is him with a basket and a<br>baguette and a bottle of wine um but I<br>was looking there at whether bark<br>Beatles um disperse whether the males<br>can um<br>mate with females that they're not<br>related to so it's it's kind of a<br>complicated story but female bark<br>beetles can fly they fly to a tree they<br>lay their eggs under the bark the the<br>eggs hatch into lvi the ly start to grow<br>up and when they're old enough they meet<br>with each other and then the females fly<br>out and find another tree but the weird<br>thing is we find males in the forest<br>flying around too so why would a species<br>invest in dispersal wings and and you<br>know the capacity to fly if it's already<br>done its job and M it with its sisters<br>bit gross but um and it turns out that<br>it's Poss for bark beetles to meet a<br>second time with unrelated males and the<br>the sperm gets stored in the spera and<br>can be used to S to to I was going to<br>say s but it's you know to to make more<br>babies so some of the babies are from<br>the first mating and some are from the<br>second but that explains why the males<br>are dispersing through the<br>forest at the end of this postdoc I was<br>pining for the Southern Hemisphere and<br>missing the sub Antarctic so I applied<br>for and got a permanent job at the<br>Australian National University and it<br>was a great place and I had great<br>colleagues and great facilities and I<br>really enjoyed my time there but I<br>missed New Zealand and<br>um I was always looking for<br>opportunities to come back to New<br>Zealand and to connect with the<br>University of atago I took every<br>opportunity to um participate in<br>University of atago alumni events this<br>is 2017 every time there was an alumni<br>event I'd call a couple of friends and<br>say hey let's go we went on Harbor<br>Cruisers um but this was at the brumes<br>versus Highlanders match in Cambra in<br>2017 we got a place in the director's<br>box um Gemma was a postto in Sydney um<br>and the the AC the the academic SLT<br>member at that event was Helen it was um<br>Helen Nicholson who later became our<br>vice Chancellor and we were hitting her<br>up for a job um we didn't get the job<br>but we both found ways to come back here<br>anyway um so in 2019 I got a Rutherford<br>discovery fellowship and um jumped at<br>the opportunity to jump the ditch and<br>come back to the University of atago so<br>I can't really separate what I did at a<br>andu from what I've done at itago<br>because it's all intermingled but just<br>to go through some of the projects that<br>my group has worked on Katie moon was my<br>first PhD student um joined me<br>ATU that's her graduating and we got a<br>selfie with the the vice Chancellor<br>who's also a noble laurate and she was<br>the valedictorian but she was looking at<br>dispersal of penguin and and it's a<br>really interesting question how these<br>parasites might disperse when they're on<br>an aquatic Coast so the penguin only<br>Travels by swimming through water I mean<br>they waddle but they don't waddle far so<br>they swim through water how can their<br>parasites which are not used to being in<br>the water they're not aquatic how can<br>they survive and can they disperse with<br>them and Katie did all sorts of cool<br>things she put ticks in like tea caddies<br>and dangled them off boats and put ticks<br>Under Pressure to see how they' cope<br>with water conditions but she also did<br>lots of genomic work looking at<br>populations and how they were similar or<br>different to each other and this is a<br>nice example of um one study she did<br>where she looked using genomic Methods<br>at populations in the Faulkland Islands<br>and Marian Island and she found that<br>while there's some evidence of ticks<br>being able to move around with Penguins<br>mostly over short distances on the whole<br>it doesn't seem that they're very well<br>suited to traveling long distances with<br>penguins at sea<br>oh that's Katie with her arm right down<br>a penguin hole penguin burrow cuz little<br>blue penguins nest in Burrows and it's<br>really counterintuitive if you're<br>Australian to go out on a hot summer's<br>day and shove your arm down a burrow in<br>the ground sometimes you do pull out a<br>snake um another group area that my<br>group's worked on on and off is uh poly<br>worms we keep coming back to some of<br>these cool animals um so you've all<br>heard of the EAC in Nemo Finding Nemo<br>they they ride the EAC down to to Sydney<br>it's a very strong current that flows<br>from north to south along the east coast<br>of Australia um and so we looked at Poly<br>worm populations along uh south coast of<br>New South Wales and now these are a bit<br>mixed up but basically different colors<br>either mean different populations or<br>different genetic lineages and you can<br>see along the coast of New South Wales<br>it's a great big mess there's lots of<br>colors everywhere and what that really<br>means is that these uh populations are<br>well mixed there's a lot of gene flow a<br>lot of movement to among different<br>populations so how can that be if the<br>EAC flows north to south shouldn't we<br>see a bit of a pattern of kind of<br>isolation and um North South<br>differentiation well it turns out the<br>EAC is only really strong in summer in<br>Winter it gets broken up by big Eddies<br>that can push pockets of water<br>northwards so another example of how<br>animals are able to use long-distance<br>dispersal in the case of the polyes it's<br>probably their ly that are going out sea<br>and being so their little babies<br>floating in the water being pushed up<br>and down the coast by the<br>currents my group's also been uh growing<br>an interest in diseases of kelp um<br>Callum Blake was an honest student who<br>worked with me several years ago Abby<br>maybe a PhD student and now Lily is an<br>honor student in my group and these guys<br>are looking at what diseases affect kelp<br>um molinia is one that we've focused on<br>a lot in the past it creates these<br>yellow warts all over the kelp um and we<br>found connections between the<br>populations of the the disease here in<br>Australia and Chile and New Zealand so<br>it seems that the disease is able to<br>travel with the kelp as well as the<br>animals that live in the kelp hold fast<br>and Lily's with the help of Gemma now<br>looking at what other diseases can<br>affect kelp and so we don't really know<br>much about what diseases are out there<br>but it's really important moving<br>forward one thing that I keep coming<br>back to in my research is Antarctic<br>ecology and in particular how isolated<br>Antarctica is so Antarctica sits in a<br>very geographically isolated location<br>there's the Southern Ocean which has the<br>strongest current in the world circling<br>around it there are also all these<br>thermal fronts and this makes it really<br>hard for things to get into and out of<br>Antarctica we all know that things like<br>whales and seals and migrating birds can<br>move into and out of Antarctica fairly<br>easily but what about the Small Things<br>the the the animals that live on land<br>the plants the the the Marine<br>invertebrates that can't disperse very<br>distances I was really surprised in 2017<br>when I got an email from a colleague<br>rasma Mah in Chile and he sent me this<br>photo of rura bull kelp washed up on a<br>beach in Antarctica everything we knew<br>about Antarctic and Southern Ocean<br>oceanography suggested that bull kelp<br>should not be able to Raft to Antarctica<br>we know it can raft long distances at<br>sea but it shouldn't be able to get<br>South to Antarctica because of the<br>Corola Force which when something's<br>drifting eastwards around the Southern<br>Ocean should push things northward so<br>all the oceanographic models showed that<br>it was impossible to get kelp um from<br>any of the locations where it grew down<br>to<br>Antarctica and yet we found it washed up<br>on beaches in King George Island at the<br>tip of the Antarctic<br>Peninsula so using highresolution<br>genomic approaches where we basically<br>took tiny bits of DNA from throughout<br>the organism and then matched it to the<br>populations where um kelp grew so this<br>was going back to samples that I'd<br>collected in my PhD which turned out to<br>have um a good lifespan good use and we<br>were able to show where exactly where<br>this kelp that washed up on Antarctic<br>beaches had come from and some of it had<br>come from kgin Islands some of it had<br>come from Maran some of it had come from<br>South Georgia some of it had come from<br>mcari so these were massive rafting<br>Journeys tens of thousands of kilometers<br>that the kelp had traveled at Sea to<br>wash up in<br>Antarctica this is uh a video of some of<br>the modeling that the oceanographers did<br>and as I said initially they couldn't<br>get the models to show kelp rafting to<br>Antarctica but it turned out we were<br>missing something in the models because<br>kelp floats right at the surface of the<br>ocean and most of the models are built<br>on data that we get from things that are<br>drifting a meter or so below the surface<br>and when something's drifting right at<br>the surface it it's affected by wind the<br>wind whips up big waves that push the<br>floating thing in different ways than we<br>might expect so when you put wind into<br>the oceanographic models wind driven<br>waves suddenly you can get kelp<br>particles which are shown here in Orange<br>reaching Antarctica but what I also like<br>about this video is it really shows how<br>different Voyages of kelp can be you<br>can't throw something into an ocean and<br>know where it's going to turn up there's<br>so much variability in where things can<br>a lot of that modeling was done by Adele<br>Morrison and um she's now supervising a<br>PhD student actually I think Hannah's<br>just submitted at unsw but one of<br>Hannah's chapters was taking this idea<br>and looking at whether we can also get<br>connections between the big southern<br>hemisphere continents like uh Australia<br>New Zealand South America and Africa and<br>Antarctica and in all cases we can see<br>the modeling showing that there's<br>connection this potential for connection<br>between these land masses so when you<br>throw a plastic bottle in the ocean here<br>in denan or in Australia or in Africa<br>it's possible for that to reach a beach<br>in<br>Antarctica and this is really important<br>from a biological context because we<br>know that Antarctica is warming so right<br>now the things that are reaching<br>Antarctica can't survive it's too cold<br>it's icy they don't like it but<br>Antarctica is one of the for fastest<br>warming places on the planet the antar<br>peninsulas warming very rapidly and it's<br>possible that by the end of this Century<br>we might see parts of the Antarctic<br>Peninsula supporting kelp so they could<br>we could see a shift from these fairly<br>Barren looking Antarctic uh<br>intertial spaces to something that's<br>much kelp not necessarily good for<br>Antarctica but I'm kind of exciting for<br>the kelp um so we have a Marsden looking<br>at this it's kind of in in the late<br>stages now but there's a bunch of<br>students who've done some really cool<br>work trying to understand whether kelp<br>or kelp the animals that kelp carries<br>with it could one day survive in<br>Antarctica and one of the things they've<br>been looking at is what happens to kelp<br>when it freezes so we know that kelp<br>traveling at Sea intersects with sea ice<br>and it might get frozen into the sea ice<br>we don't really know what happens to it<br>so in the lab here um Sophie Sinclair<br>who was a summer student froze some bits<br>of kelp and looked at what happened to<br>how well it floated afterwards and she<br>found that it didn't float quite as well<br>but it could still float after being<br>frozen<br>um Pluto is a PhD student in my team and<br>Ben a master student and one of the<br>things that they're doing as part of<br>their much bigger projects is looking at<br>how kelp and in Pluto's case this in<br>Pluto's case that's macroy not bull kelp<br>so giant kelp um how it copes with being<br>frozen in terms of how well it can<br>reproduce Can it have babies after being<br>frozen um this is a picture of so this<br>green bit in the middle is a picture of<br>uh down a microscope of some of the<br>spings that Ben's been growing after<br>freezing bull kelp in the<br>lab we've also been doing some modeling<br>so Francis was a master student who<br>finished recently and she did some<br>really cool work putting temperature<br>loggers inside kelp hold fast she cut a<br>little door put a temperature logger in<br>glue the door back on and and then<br>collect the logger later and see um what<br>the temperature changes had be had been<br>and what she found was that inside the<br>hold fasts it's kind of unsurprising but<br>it's it's like a house it buffers the<br>animals from the environment outside so<br>it's not as cold or as hot outside the<br>hold fast as inside the hold fast so<br>that could be good for Animals As we<br>move into hotter Summers here but it<br>might also mean that if kelp ever does<br>set up shop in Antarctica um it might be<br>able to help the animals survive that<br>really extreme cold condition by giving<br>them a home inside the hold fast Grant<br>Duffy was a postdoc working with my<br>group and he's some nice modeling that<br>shows that under kind of moderate<br>warming climate warming scenarios we<br>could expect to see some parts of the<br>Antarctic Peninsula it hasn't come up<br>too well on the slides there but this is<br>a map of the Antarctic Peninsula and you<br>can see these little orange bits where<br>we might see kelp bu kelp establishing<br>in the future maybe by the end of this<br>Century um William finished his PhD in<br>my group and just shout out to William<br>for coming down from Oakland too for<br>this talk thank you very very much um<br>William did a really nice PhD looking at<br>the microbiome of kelp rafting at Sea<br>and how it changes but one of the things<br>I really like that came out of his PhD<br>was he took a sort of a big step back<br>and said what about not just kelp but<br>everything when something moves to a new<br>place and travels a long distance to get<br>there what happens to the bacteria on it<br>we know that microbes like bacteria are<br>really important for health of us and<br>plants and animals but what happens when<br>you go to a new Environ<br>does your microbiome change along the<br>way and does it change when you get<br>there and there's a whole bunch of<br>things that William kind of looked at<br>and thought about that might affect how<br>microbiomes change as species<br>disperse I'm not going to play this film<br>but if you want to go and have a look we<br>did have a film made by Tailor media<br>it's a really nice animated film with a<br>little animated Gribble isopod um<br>talking about this idea of kelp rafting<br>to Antarctica it's also available in<br>Mari so if you have kids or you want to<br>take this out to schools you know um a<br>really nice way of kind of getting a<br>seven-minute idea of what this research<br>is all about now I've been talking a lot<br>so I thought we'd just have a pause and<br>have a look at some of the the field<br>sites that I've had the privilege to go<br>through go to through my career um so<br>this is the Southern Ocean on a good day<br>um this is a Patagonian Fjord I was on a<br>boat where we were chasing whales um<br>somebody on the boat need needed to get<br>DNA samples so we were actually shooting<br>whales just with little DNA collecting<br>bits now this is a ice breaker in the<br>Southern Ocean I spent a lot of time on<br>ice breakers um it's not for the<br>seasick it's quite rough um but they<br>were always Amazing Adventures on on one<br>trip uh we had to rescue survivors of a<br>sinking yacht answering an SOS call on<br>another trip somebody on the boat got<br>murdered<br>um on the whole it was fantastic though<br>and the food was always really good um<br>this is me snorkeling in the sub<br>Antarctic um of course all okay with o<br>ands but it was very cold and I never<br>bothered to invest in a dry suit here's<br>some just some gratuitous footage of<br>penguins which I threw in because<br>everybody likes Penguins these are Gen 2<br>penguins in the Forkland Islands um you<br>could keep a respectful distance but<br>they didn't respect your distance your<br>your personal space and would come right<br>up and peck it your Sho your shoes and<br>notebook here's some Dolphins riding the<br>wake of a ship I think this is back in<br>Patagonia<br>again King Penguins on Maran Island tens<br>of thousands of penguins in a colony if<br>anyone's been to a king penguin Colony<br>you know what it smells<br>like and these are some baby elephant<br>seals having a little battle and then<br>being baby elephant seals they just get<br>too tired to carry on<br>anymore this is the boat we took in the<br>Patagonian Fields worst cruise I've been<br>on the boat leaked the captain didn't<br>know what he was doing we kept smashing<br>into things in fact that boat sank on<br>the next Cruise um and when I asked<br>about the smell they said don't worry<br>it's just the burning asbestos it's like<br>what this is um getting onto an off an<br>ice breaker in Antarctica uh we had to<br>climb up a little rope ladder to get<br>onto it uh really exciting they also<br>threw the suitcases down into that Dy to<br>get them off and one of my suitcases<br>fell in the water suitcases in<br>Antarctica somewhere um and this is<br>penguins in volcanic Steam on Deception<br>Island in Antarctica and we talk more<br>about that<br>later so that's a lot about dispersal<br>but not so much about disturbance so I<br>just want to cover a couple of topics<br>touching on disturbance because one of<br>the things that kept bugging me was that<br>we kept seeing really high genetic<br>diversity in Bull kelp which is how<br>we're able to pick up a piece in<br>Antarctica and say exactly where it came<br>from but if kelp is so good at floating<br>how does it maintain this genetic<br>diversity How come every population has<br>its own genetic signature and I think<br>it's because these populations are<br>really dense and there's not a lot of<br>space for something new to get in at any<br>time so let's say this is just off Tyro<br>ah heads here there's only this little<br>patch of of bar Rock available at any<br>time for something new to get in and all<br>of those local kelp are releasing their<br>eggs and sperm into the water when it's<br>reproductive season so it's like like<br>the water is just a soup of eggs and<br>sperm keep that in mind when you're<br>swimming in<br>Winter if you get rafts coming from<br>somewhere else they release their eggs<br>and sperm into the water column maybe<br>but there's hardly any of them compared<br>to the eggsit sperm of the locals so the<br>chances are that that space that's<br>available is going to get taken by um<br>Offspring kids of one of the local uh<br>kelp instead of something new so that<br>really kind of keeps populations as they<br>are unless something changes and um John<br>and I thought a lot about this um back<br>in the day and if you imagine this is uh<br>a bit of land and every circle is a<br>different population of something let's<br>say a butterfly or something and every<br>color is a different genetic lineage so<br>every population has its own genetic uh<br>signature it's different and then<br>there's a massive disturbance wipes out<br>a huge chunk of the populations whatever<br>gets into that area first has an<br>advantage it can multiply and it can<br>kind of hog all the land so that nothing<br>else can take it so even though stuff is<br>still dispersing from other populations<br>into that region it now doesn't have a<br>chance of setting up shop so this is a<br>really nice example of how things might<br>be able to change after<br>disturbance and it's one of the ways<br>that we track what happened after the<br>ice ages and so there's lots and lots of<br>studies from Europe but this is a cool<br>one looking at hedgehogs where at the<br>peak of the last ice age we had four<br>Hedgehog genetic types Sheltering down<br>in the South and then as the ice melted<br>they were able to go north but they<br>couldn't move East or West because there<br>were other hedgehogs I like this one<br>because it's not like when you go out<br>you're tripping over hedgehogs and yet<br>there were they were filling up all the<br>Hedgehog space um and so what we see now<br>in Europe is this really nice pattern of<br>sectoring where there's different<br>genetic signatures different genetic<br>lineages of hedgehogs running north to<br>south in Europe but I wondered if we<br>could test this in real time and I was<br>thinking about this and trying to write<br>a grant proposal um in November<br>2016 um and actually I was flown over to<br>CRA to give a talk about science as<br>Richard mentioned I was scientist of the<br>year then um so this was a a way of<br>Cambra showcasing it self to<br>wellingtonians cuz we just got direct<br>flights um between CRA and Wellington<br>they were trying to entice Wellington<br>people to come to C as we took a whole<br>bunch of businesses over to Wellington<br>including a business that made amazing<br>thick shakes called freak shakes which<br>in retrospect was a really unfortunate<br>name um because that night the night we<br>arrived there was a massive earthquake<br>um and this is as I was running down the<br>stairs in the hotel the walls were<br>cracking that was in Wellington and that<br>wasn't even the Epic Cent of the<br>earthquake as many of you know so it was<br>really dramatic and the next morning I<br>started ringing geologists saying do you<br>think there could have been enough<br>uplift to wipe out kelp populations um<br>and the geologists I spoke to said no<br>wrong type of earthquake you won't have<br>had uplift so I flew back to camra as<br>instructed but then started seeing<br>pictures of uplift along the coast with<br>power stranded so I went on Twitter and<br>said hey could anyone get me some Kel<br>from those zones and we did actually<br>manage to get a fisherman to get some<br>Kel but I could see from photos he sent<br>it was the wrong kelp um so John and I<br>flew up to blenham and got in a car and<br>traveled down into the uplifted Zone um<br>we managed to get past the roadblocks<br>and it was absolutely um incredible<br>seeing the devastation um I you know I<br>acknowledge there might be people in the<br>room who were affected by this from a<br>scientific point of view though it was a<br>really amazing opportunity you can see<br>the fault line here where the rock<br>platform was cut and that whole Rock PL<br>platform came up six MERS so everything<br>that was underwater was now above water<br>and we saw subtitle seaweeds sitting on<br>those rocks<br>dying that's the picture of the rock<br>platform um that where the uplift was<br>highest and so an honest student the the<br>following year in 2017 um and we walked<br>along beaches and we picked up bits of<br>bull kelp that looked like they'd come<br>from somewhere else there wasn't much<br>bull kelp left in the area because of<br>the uplift it had all been wiped out and<br>we used genetics to work out where it<br>had come from and uh jonette was able to<br>show that a lot of the kelp that was<br>washing up in North Canterbury had come<br>from far away sometimes as far away as<br>the sub Antarctic or fjordland now we've<br>been tracking that for years John had a<br>masden that he led and and I had it in<br>my future Fellowship too we've been<br>going back year after year and tracking<br>what's happening it hasn't really<br>stabilized yet but there's potential for<br>us to see change because huge<br>populations were completely wiped out<br>and there's a possibility for some<br>something new to get in so this kind of<br>speaks to how change can open up new<br>opportunities and just finally I want to<br>talk about um uh another area of<br>research where I've been looking at um<br>how Antarctica coped with the last ice<br>age so we know there are a lot of<br>species in and around Antarctica that<br>have been there for millions and<br>millions of years things like mosses<br>which are the jungles of Antarctica um<br>and the little invertebrates that live<br>in the Mosses<br>in the mosses and they occur wherever<br>there's ice free land which is not many<br>places in Antarctica shown here in pink<br>but at the peak of the last ice age<br>there really shouldn't have been much if<br>any ice free land available because ice<br>went right to the edge of the<br>continental shelf and blanketed most of<br>the continent so how did these species<br>survive and I was thinking about this<br>when I was watching David atra and he<br>was on the in the frozen planet he went<br>into the caves on Mount arabus and I<br>remember thinking wow those were would<br>be great places to hang out during an<br>Ice<br>Age so I got a grant to look at whether<br>volcanoes had supported life through ice<br>ages in Antarctica this is a temperature<br>log a temperature probe stuck in soil on<br>Deception Island uh you can see it's I<br>don't know if you can see but it's 45.6<br>de C even though there's ice all around<br>and the snot was freezing as it came out<br>of my nose um but these volcanoes could<br>support potentially a whole lot of life<br>through ice ages and if that's the case<br>then as we went out of an ice age and<br>more ice free land opened up species<br>could have moved out and colonized those<br>spots but then we should see a decrease<br>in the number of species at those sites<br>compared to where they sheltered around<br>volcanoes and when we look at patterns<br>of species richness or the number of<br>species in Antarctica that's exactly<br>what we see we see a really steep<br>decline of um species diversity moving<br>away from volcanoes and also the things<br>that are further away are kind of a<br>subset of what's actually at the volcano<br>so that really sort of supports the<br>hypothesis but if species survived in um<br>places like Ice Caves on volcanoes at<br>the last glacial maximum then we should<br>find them there today and nobody's<br>really gone and looked and we can't<br>because these caves are off limits at<br>the moment but I got some soil samples<br>collected by Craig kry from a lot of the<br>Ice Caves around Antarctica um around<br>Mount arabus and looked used DNA to look<br>for evidence of plants and animals and<br>we found it we found algae and<br>springtails and mosses and more algae<br>and nematodes and alites and um<br>arthropods that we couldn't match to<br>anything that we know of and more algae<br>um and this was really cool so it<br>suggests there could be entire<br>ecosystems we know nothing about living<br>in Antarctica in these caves under the<br>ice um and this was my favorite heading<br>a headline um that came out of there was<br>there was a lot of media coverage but a<br>lot of it really just took that kind of<br>wow could be aliens there could be stuff<br>we know nothing about but there probably<br>are things we know nothing about living<br>under the ice sheet in Antarctica so<br>just going back finally to that um<br>picture I showed you of penguins in<br>Steam on Deception Island this has kind<br>of spurred a new line of thinking<br>because when Katie was doing her PhD on<br>penguin ticks we used Sulfur powder to<br>get the in the the parasites off the<br>Penguins and I suspect that the reason I<br>saw penguins and seals and um skewers<br>and all sorts of things hanging out in<br>volcanic Steam on Deception Island is<br>because they're using it to get rid of<br>parasites um so we're starting a new<br>research project on that this and<br>Claudia is a PhD who's already joined<br>the project looking at the microbes um<br>of organisms in geothermal regions but<br>this is some videos where we took a a<br>wrecky trip up to Rotorua a few weeks<br>ago and you can see swans pining in<br>geothermal steam you can you can see<br>gulls nesting and flying around in<br>geothermal steam swallows all sorts of<br>things are choosing to hang out in<br>geothermal Steam and it might be to get<br>rid of parasites on them so I hope I've<br>shown you that dispersal and disturbance<br>kind of interact to drive patterns of<br>biodiversity and really have a big part<br>to play in evolution now in my last<br>minute let me thank all the many many<br>people who've helped get me here this is<br>definitely not a journey I've done on my<br>own especially my supervisors and<br>mentors but also my friends and<br>family and of course my research team my<br>students both current and past my<br>research assistants including rishy<br>who's been dragged out in the field um<br>against his will and summer students so<br>thank you all and let me finish with a<br>faki<br>again M I like this one cuz it's Marine<br>but it means never give up don't die<br>like an octopus which apparently just<br>give up the dope when they're attacked<br>um I'm not sure I've seen an octopus do<br>that but die like a hammerhead shark I<br>want to just mention that no success is<br>a no no career is a pathway of pure<br>success for every success I've had there<br>have been a lot of failures along the<br>way so it's really about perseverance<br>and I'll just leave a slide up there<br>with some of the lead light windows that<br>Peter's helped me make uh this one's<br>still in progress the the seal sea lions<br>at the bottom so thank you all very much<br>for listening<br>that<br>working<br>yeah the head of the Marine Science<br>Department and I just want to say for a<br>thanks everyone for coming along and and<br>um joining us and celebrating cr's um<br>promotion to professor and and um first<br>of all what an awesome talk really well<br>you and and I think you know it's hard<br>to follow up things that the Richards<br>have said um in terms of your your what<br>you've achieved so far someone who's<br>who's uh so young but Stella tradictory<br>you know well relatively speaking to to<br>to me anyway yeah and I think it really<br>reflects you know your passion think<br>you're I mean you're extended far now<br>clearly I can see where you've got all<br>your your talents from I mean that's an<br>inredible pedigree and find out that<br>you've you've you've got supporting you<br>and I must be quite proud to to think<br>that you've come from that must be very<br>proud of you say in terms of what you've<br>achieved um and and yeah it's fantastic<br>um I think yeah really reflects your<br>dedication to your research I mean as I<br>said in a lot of people during lockdown<br>wouldn't be writing books but you know<br>for someone like you to to go ahead and<br>I think even emailed me to to ask advice<br>and what very split some pieces and it<br>was fantastic to see someone who was<br>really out<br>there um I think we we share some of the<br>research interest I mean we do<br>collaborate on a number of things I can<br>really vouch for um for the kind of<br>research you're doing and you've really<br>given us a taste of what you've what<br>you've um what you've done so<br>far and I think it also um means I'm<br>quite familiar with your standing within<br>the research community that that we both<br>share the antartic community among other<br>things and I mean you really have got an<br>amazing<br>reputation amongst nationally<br>internationally amongst your your peers<br>thank you um and I think you know it's<br>it's really um it's really fortunate<br>someone in your position's got choices<br>on where you where you would choose to<br>go where you would choose to do your<br>research and I think we're so lucky to<br>have you choose a taro as a as a place<br>to to make a career and um and and raise<br>a family and contribute to the community<br>and and academically and and and what<br>have so<br>yeah thanks very much and I also just<br>want to acknowledge the contribution<br>that you make not only to the

lot of commitments isn't<br>it's you didn't necessarily need to do<br>that so but you clearly um just finally<br>I think you know what you showed in your<br>talk your bravery your physical bravery<br>going on Southern Ocean and braving the<br>Seas and jumping off boats and putting<br>up with with bad Skippers and other<br>things that have happened on the ship<br>which sound a bit more serious by the<br>sound of it but yeah the worst thing on<br>that trip was that we ran out of toilet<br>paper on day three yeah yeah yeah that<br>sounds yeah maybe that's why the the the<br>murder happened I'm not<br>sure sorry it's not a laughing matter so<br>yeah um any anyway I think yeah thanks<br>very much and congratulations and we<br>look forward to you contributing to the<br>Department
