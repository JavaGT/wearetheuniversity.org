Things<br>I didn't imagine before coming here<br>really surprised me.<br>I made a lot of friends here. The people<br>here are very welcoming,<br>both New Zealanders and people from<br>outside. For me, it was a great experience.  such a<br>totally assertive choice and I don't<br>regret anything and I'm looking forward to the<br>next TR years when I was<br>studying the options to do my<br>graduation outside of Brazil I wanted a<br>relatively small country that had<br>a very good infrastructure so I<br>ended up starting  I researched and ended up<br>finding New Zealand, so it's a<br>small country with<br>abundant nature, a beautiful country but with<br>phenomenal infrastructure, and seeing<br>the city options in New Zealand, I<br>ended up finding Tauranga, which is a<br>very beautiful city with a<br>very good structure too.  a city<br>that from what I researched is also a<br>city that receives the most sunlight in<br>New Zealand. So this is a<br>totally positive point, even more so for those<br>coming from Brazil. I ended up finding the<br>University of Waikato, so I started<br>researching and went to the website and saw that  had<br>some very very good rankings and I also saw<br>that they had the course I was taking  I've<br>been looking for it since I wanted to do<br>my undergraduate degree and I found exactly the course<br>I wanted, which is the<br>Bachelor of Business and Marketing as a<br>Major. In my first week of class,<br>I came across a classroom<br>that I had never had experience of<br>before.  It's a room like<br>an auditorium and the classes are<br>very modern because I also have the<br>option of if for some reason I<br>can't go to class, I can<br>watch the recorded class later, very<br>modern like that and also the topics<br>of the classes are  totally current topics<br>like we learned about blockchain<br>about artificial intelligence are some<br>things I wasn't expecting to study<br>at a college, I was<br>quite surprised, the university is very well<br>located here within the city, it's<br>right in the center of it, so you leave<br>college and you're in  center so you<br>have many options to go have coffee<br>and lunch and I'm also living in the<br>college dormitory which is 3<br>minutes walk from here so I don't have to<br>worry about buses or<br>cars so I come walking every day<br>we have our own bathroom<br>So every room has its own<br>bathroom this is something I think is<br>a super positive point and it is also a  A<br>room like this is comfortable, you don't feel<br>cramped, you don't need more space,<br>and if you're thinking about moving outside of<br>Brazil, I recommend the University of W<br>Cato without thinking twice. It's<br>a college like this that you won't<br>regret coming to. I'll see you there.  at the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
