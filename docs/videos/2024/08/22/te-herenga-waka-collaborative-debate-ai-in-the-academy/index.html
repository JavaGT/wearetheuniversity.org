pleasure this afternoon to Welcome<br>All of You staff students alumni members<br>of the public and people dialing in even<br>from overseas to watch the live stream<br>Welcome to our uh collaborative debate<br>on a I in the academy it's a fairly<br>trite thing for me to say that AI is a<br>fairly Hot Topic right now that's a<br>given obviously but Academia is<br>grappling with both the challenge and<br>the opportunity that artificial<br>intelligence offers to us in the<br>teaching and learning space it is both a<br>tool that we can use and possibly a<br>threat and how do we learn to use that<br>tool most convincingly and to everyone's<br>advantage in the research space likewise<br>there's opportunities that AI offers and<br>there's concerns about some of the<br>ethical obligations that come with it in<br>fact it was a a research related<br>incident that Ali and Alex Gibson um<br>encountered during their research where<br>AI was actually acting as a participant<br>in their research that provoked the<br>conversations that have led to this<br>debate so you're not here to listen to<br>me um very luckily we have one of our<br>experts in a i Professor Ali KN who's<br>going to MC the debate but just a word<br>about the format this is what's called a<br>collaborative debate so in a<br>collaborative debate it's incumbent upon<br>each of our panelists to support and<br>acknowledge a point made before them and<br>so then build on that and amplify the<br>conversation so I'm sure everybody here<br>is um prepared to listen with mutual<br>respect and monari Tanger and um without<br>that I'm no more to say and thank you<br>all for being here I will uh see you<br>again at the end thank you and over to<br>mucho um it's it's nice to see uh an<br>audience for this debate there's nothing<br>like a debate in a public place like<br>this and in the University uh it's so<br>important for this debate uh to extend<br>to the entire University and and so it's<br>great to see you all here I'm guessing<br>the Olympics is finished and so now here<br>you are uh we've still got an<br>interesting uh event for you I wouldn't<br>say contest because this is<br>collaborative of course um so the<br>structure of this is going to be that<br>there will be three different sessions<br>and each session has two speakers uh the<br>first one is on this is all to do with<br>the role of of of AI in the University<br>ours and others I think um the first is<br>about Ai and research uh the second is<br>about Ai and teaching and learning and<br>the third one is about AI in the<br>production of content or the production<br>of knowledge so without further Ado<br>let's get going we're going to have two<br>of these speakers in each session uh in<br>the first session the two speakers on<br>the left here we'll start with Andrew<br>lensen and then we'll have Ali Gibson so<br>Andrew let me call you there's gonna be<br>five minutes for each speaker and then<br>we'll have five minute discussion this<br>the discussion is just going to involve<br>the panel here but there will be an<br>opportunity for everyone afterwards to<br>participate um at the end of the hour<br>basically so Andrew<br>thank you very much Alie it's great to<br>be here and it's great to be forced to<br>be positive about AI for once usually<br>I'm the great cynic so I've been told I<br>have to be nice and be positive about Ai<br>and research closer there we go oh my<br>goodness that is close um and I think I<br>think this isn't something that Bry said<br>around around the example of of AI as a<br>participant in studies I think there's<br>actually a really exciting opportunity I<br>mean you guys had sort of a bad Vibe<br>with it as the kids would say I think um<br>but there's a real potential for the use<br>of AI and research for doing user<br>studies and doing preliminary testing<br>and I think that's a really exciting<br>topic why recruit 200 people when you<br>can just have a chat chat gbt and get a<br>whole of human thoughts you know who<br>needs who needs that who needs to spend<br>money on on research um participants but<br>beyond that there's lots of other ways<br>that we can use our on Research I mean<br>we do so much mandane stuff in our<br>research we have to write grants who<br>I think I thought bny might put her hand<br>up um I mean it's it's it's useful<br>process but we spend so much time<br>crafting these grants when you get a 10%<br>chance getting funded I mean get chat<br>GPT to do it you get your whole life<br>back it's great right um and of course<br>on top of that things like reporting for<br>Grants things like proofing your writing<br>things like grammarly are using Ai and<br>and they are a great way to learn how to<br>use grammar properly and learn to write<br>better and even things like literature<br>review and knowledge Discovery so when<br>we as researchers when we want to do a<br>new topic or we want to find a new line<br>of inquiry we look at literature but<br>there's so much out there and if it's<br>just us trying to TRW who Google Scholar<br>I mean that's not effective we have<br>these tools that can search entire<br>databases can summarize information you<br>know there's a massive role here for us<br>to be smarter and more efficient<br>researchers and that means making more<br>of a change to society and having better<br>outcomes as<br>well and in that way it's also a great<br>democratizer so I can code well I used<br>to be a to code but many of my<br>colleagues in different disciplines<br>perhaps aren't as confident about it and<br>yet coding is such a core part of<br>research these days things like<br>statistical analysis um things like data<br>analysis in general things like that you<br>can get AI to help you and then it means<br>no matter what your discipline is you<br>can also benefit from those<br>techniques things I know what te test to<br>use or how many samples you need or how<br>to write this python or our script you<br>don't need to learn that anymore you get<br>chat yout or whatever you want to write<br>it for you I mean sure you got to check<br>the results but you can save a lot of<br>time there and you can sort of be much<br>more powerful as a<br>result um another thing I find quite<br>exciting is that AI can help us to think<br>outside the box in our research so all<br>too often we get our own views and we<br>get I guess increasingly narrow minded<br>as we get more aware of our area more<br>aware of our topic but if we have a chat<br>with chat gbt or another agent maybe it<br>can give us some new ideas some<br>different perspectives how can we<br>interpret these problems in different<br>ways or L are some things we might not<br>have thought of um it can be our sort of<br>co-pilot not not Microsoft co-pilot but<br>but our research<br>co-pilot uh and of course AI as as a<br>general concept has massive potential in<br>all sorts of domains right I do a lot of<br>work with ecology with lawyers with<br>geographers looking at how we can use AI<br>to solve environmental problems to<br>protect floods to uh enable access to<br>justice so there's this massive area of<br>research not just in using AI tools but<br>developing new uh methods that can help<br>us to get better outcomes and do<br>Innovative new research that will really<br>change our world and I think us as a<br>university have a really good<br>opportunity to do that we have quite a<br>few AI staff we have a lot of really<br>curious thinkers and so there's a<br>massive potential there as<br>well um I thought I was going to go on<br>for longer but I somehow run out of<br>points so what we'll do is I will hand<br>over to Abby and then I guess we'll just<br>discuss more<br>afterwards um thanks Andrew so I I<br>forgot to say that Andrew is a colleague<br>of mine from the School of Engineering<br>and computer science and and Ali is from<br>the school of health Ali Gibson um so uh<br>please your take on on AI and research<br>Teno um i' first like to to too Andrew<br>we are facing an incredible opportunity<br>for researchers to come together across<br>disciplines um to explore the impact of<br>AI on our work and I certainly never saw<br>myself collaborating with my colleagues<br>in computer science as a social<br>scientist but here I am today what I've<br>also learned especially from critical<br>conversations with colleagues like Simon<br>melum Alex Bey um what you were talking<br>about Andrew is that AI can be a tool to<br>promote equity for<br>example it can remove some of the<br>barriers that we experience across a an<br>industry that is dominated by English um<br>that it can make writing and Publishing<br>more exive accessible for non-native<br>speakers and I even concede that it is<br>very tempting to give into The Narrative<br>of being time poor and wondering whether<br>the AI Technologies could make some<br>aspects of my job easier quicker or even<br>take them off my plate Al<br>together because we live in a world<br>where productivity speed and time and<br>profits are valued Above All Else we've<br>responded to AI enthusiastically and<br>uncritically to answer our as the answer<br>to our<br>problems and as Andrew alluded to there<br>are all sorts of pro programs and apps<br>that are now available to shortcut the<br>research process um so from a<br>qualitative researchers<br>perspective I now have access to AI<br>powered software that could write<br>research proposals review and read and<br>summarize literature for me take notes<br>transcribe my interviews um even code<br>and analyze um the D<br>so AI has seemingly replaced me as a<br>qualitative researcher but what if the<br>quality of this AI generated research<br>would some even call this deep fake<br>research we question students use of AI<br>in assignments and learning but what<br>about our own use of generative Ai and<br>other AI<br>Technologies where would the role of AI<br>end and that of the researcher begin<br>is it the same as researchers using<br>other digital Technologies because my<br>sense up till now is<br>no so these are the sorts of questions<br>that I encountered um with my team when<br>during doing field work um for my mas<br>and Grant funded by the Royal Society we<br>were looking to gather stories about<br>people's experiences and perceptions of<br>mobile dating during the height of the<br>pandemic and instead gathered generic<br>synthetic data seemingly produced used<br>through AI at the prompt of wait for it<br>Bots um and I won't rehash our published<br>article but to say that we decided that<br>using such data fail would fail to serve<br>the purposes of understanding emotion<br>people's responses to the pandemic and<br>public health guidelines and ultimately<br>The Human<br>Condition we've been approaching AI as a<br>revolutionary tool or set of tools to be<br>operated by humans but researchers need<br>to consider their use of AI as a matter<br>of integrity and rigor applying much<br>more critical reflection decision making<br>and transparency than what's taken place<br>as of<br>yet as a social scientist what's at the<br>Forefront of my mind with the use of AI<br>is the implication of using AI software<br>such as the content of sensitive<br>interviews that I've conducted with<br>cancer patients and how that might be<br>used to train large language models<br>data that they didn't agree to be used<br>for that purpose or how data sovereignty<br>might be navigated when data is entered<br>into um and stored in software that is<br>not necessarily governed by the treaties<br>of indigenous<br>rights and saying this acknowledge that<br>as academics we come from varying<br>perspectives in terms of how we view the<br>world how we study it and make sense of<br>it I encourage researchers to critically<br>evaluate the use of AI in relation to<br>the foundational beliefs of their own<br>disciplines th this might result in<br>quite different responses and<br>conclusions for different fields but<br>also hopefully with time we might find<br>points of agreement on what counts as<br>the fair use of AI in conducting This<br>research and hopefully today's event<br>will come some way in doing that some of<br>this work is going to need to occur on<br>an individual and social level through<br>introspection through conversation<br>between and amongst research<br>colleagues however I also think that<br>there's an opportunity for this work to<br>be undertaken at the institutional level<br>in much the same way as it's starting to<br>happen in the sphere of teaching and<br>learning so this could include<br>publishing houses funding bodies and<br>research officers determining their<br>policies of AI use in the development<br>conduct and dissemination of research<br>ethics and other research committees<br>developing guidelines for fair<br>use or educational institutions<br>reviewing what AI software is made<br>available through licenses and that<br>ensure the privacy and storage of data<br>and protect the ownership of that data<br>so what I'm urging others to consider is<br>that we need to focus on Less on the<br>affordances of AI and more time on<br>critically examining its use on the<br>basis of Ethics rigor and<br>transparency and disciplinary principles<br>under in our work thank you thanks so<br>much so now just a little discussion<br>about Ai and research and I thought<br>maybe I'd open this up with with a a<br>question maybe for both of you but let's<br>start with Andrew um do you feel that uh<br>Consulting AI as an academic is going to<br>take away from Consulting your human<br>colleagues because you might imagine<br>that all of the brainstorming that you<br>can do uh might also be done with humans<br>and so where do you draw the line or how<br>do you sort of apportion that work<br>between humans because we don't want to<br>take humans out of the loop<br>obviously that's a that's a yeah that's<br>a great question<br>um I'm not going to try and be strictly<br>positive anymore because it's unnatural<br>um but thank you thank you um but I I I<br>will say for for one thing I think about<br>a lot is that if we use things like chat<br>gbt or any AI model to help us think<br>about things and in some ways that can<br>lock us into one way of thinking because<br>when you think about things automation<br>bias when chat gptc you hear are 10 ways<br>you could structure your research or 10<br>ideas you sort of maybe get trapped a<br>little bit into those 10 and think well<br>these the only 10 I can consider and so<br>it can be hard to break out of that um<br>and so even though it's quite good for<br>that sort of ideation brainstorming<br>phrase I think as you said talking to<br>your colleagues and not giving them your<br>list but giving saying what do you think<br>what are your thoughts what have I<br>missed here I I think that's always<br>going to be essential um that sort of<br>creativity to to the research yeah can I<br>just add to add to that<br>yes okay um thinking about collaborating<br>with our colleagues it also comes<br>through even in things like um Reading<br>literature that when you read someone's<br>article you engage with them in a<br>conversation you you know you find find<br>out their perspective you sometimes you<br>know meet them at a conference and<br>you're like oh I read your research on<br>such and such and that Sparks<br>conversation and connections Reading<br>literature often you know you reach out<br>to someone as a result but I think that<br>if you've got GPT or some kind of AI<br>technology telling you what articles to<br>read and summarizing them for you you<br>don't get that same human element in<br>connection with colleagues in the fields<br>so I think there's<br>similarly yeah there's a place for kind<br>of very<br>superficial um kind of summarizing in<br>that but not the human I think I agree<br>we need to make sure that we know who's<br>in control here that it's the human that<br>stays somehow in control or in the loop<br>or engaged um so yes certainly I did<br>want to ask you Ali one question so AI<br>in research is one thing but another<br>thing is research about the use of AI<br>and I'm presuming that's still<br>completely uh you know fair game and an<br>important topic more important than ever<br>we need to study how this thing is being<br>used and how it can be well used and in<br>particularly what you were doing in<br>evaluating uh the the output from AI<br>seems to be a very important<br>task yeah great question Alie um so<br>that's actually something that really<br>interests me as a qualitative<br>methodologist and where I see my own<br>research going in the future in the<br>imminent future is um exploring<br>qualitative researchers use of AI across<br>the various aspects of the research<br>process um and exploring you know how<br>how do people find using it where do<br>they see the benefits and the drawbacks<br>and the pitfalls um and I think but<br>again within that um par you know within<br>the particular Paradigm that they're<br>working and how that impacts the onology<br>epistemology um and methodology of their<br>work okay um I've got one other question<br>for both of you I suppose and this is a<br>money question um we have to pay for<br>these AI services that we're using and<br>the more we do it basically there are<br>going to be giant multinational<br>companies that clip the ticket on every<br>research uh piece that we do I wonder if<br>either of you or both of you could speak<br>for that I mean<br>re there's a good mic and a bad mic yeah<br>there a good mic and a bad mic I mean<br>yeah this one working research has<br>already kind of pay to win and that we<br>get grants so that we can pay students<br>and pay our and buy equipment and you<br>know there there's already this whole<br>the rich get richer there's all these<br>issues already and so in some ways it's<br>just as you said it's sort of adding to<br>that you know we have to pay to get we<br>have to get grants to pay students to<br>pay for research to publish we got to<br>increasingly pay Open Access fees and so<br>AI being a bigger part of that is is is<br>how do we make this sustainable and I<br>think it also becomes an issue for early<br>career researchers who don't have money<br>who don't have the same opportunities<br>and so I don't know probably a question<br>for our our leaders here is is how do we<br>support uh or enable the use of AI if it<br>is going to cost money that being said I<br>will also quickly say that the open<br>source Community for example has gone a<br>long way in their models and so I'm<br>really hopeful that the whole<br>democratization of AI will allow us to<br>have our own models maybe in house that<br>we can host or even on our own computers<br>and then that means we can stay away<br>from the sort of big evil corporations<br>and and yeah keep more autonomy good<br>point probably just to summarize and<br>this is definitely out of my wheelhouse<br>but it's not even the financial cost of<br>AI but what about the environmental<br>impact of AI um that we often don't see<br>um but we need to explore um further and<br>I know you were recently and actually<br>all three of you were mentioned in that<br>article and the environmental impact<br>good okay well I think we we'll call it<br>there for AI in in research and let's<br>move on to AI in teaching and learning<br>so before I do can I just hands up if<br>you're at the University put your hands<br>up if if you're here at the uni any<br>University actually so not everyone here<br>and now put your hand up if you use<br>AI okay so we we have a community of<br>users here which is great to see uh<br>we're talking to the those who know in<br>some sense um let's move on to I'm<br>teaching and learning and I'll start off<br>again by introducing my colleague uh<br>Simon mcallum from the School of<br>Engineering and computer science um he's<br>he's going to uh to Pace the<br>floor so uh kior uh of course I'm Mela<br>Maho um I've been teaching for about 30<br>years right so as a as a lecturer when I<br>first started teaching I thought that my<br>role was to impart information so I'd<br>have content heavy lectures I'd have<br>maths on slides I'd be trying to get the<br>stuff that's in my head into the heads<br>of my students thinking that that was my<br>role I quickly learned that that's not<br>my role at all my role has been to<br>inspire my students to want to learn<br>what I'm trying to teach because very<br>quickly in the late 90s the internet was<br>available and all of the things that I<br>was teaching all of the knowledge I was<br>teaching was available online and so my<br>students didn't need me to be a font of<br>knowledge they needed me to care about<br>them now the the thing is that a lot of<br>education for the last 100 years has<br>been a combination of I want you to<br>become more like me right and I'm going<br>to to create assessments to drive you<br>forward and I think that I by assessing<br>I can measure how much you've learned<br>and our assessments were actually not<br>about how much did you learned they were<br>often on what you produced because<br>producing something requires time and<br>effort and learning requires time and<br>effort and if I just assess your time<br>and effort by measuring what you can<br>produce I somehow get a proxy for your<br>learning AI has destroyed that<br>relationship AI means that I can now<br>produce and output without the same<br>effort right and without the same time<br>and so all of our previous assessments<br>have basically been thrown out the<br>window we can no longer assess the way<br>we were it also means that the things<br>that I'd been teaching the idea that you<br>know if I've got lots of knowledge in my<br>head that gives me value right that<br>somehow I am valuable in society because<br>I'm very clever right I've learned a lot<br>of things that are hard to know and then<br>people will pay me to either as a<br>lecturer talk about those things I know<br>or an industry perform tasks using that<br>knowledge AI has also come to destroy<br>that so we're actually moving to a space<br>where being clever will not have any<br>transactional<br>value I will not make money by being<br>clever because if you want the best<br>chess player in the world it is the AIS<br>the AIS beat every human being so if you<br>actually if your life depended on<br>winning a game of chess you would not<br>rely on a human to do that you would get<br>a machine to be your Gladiator right now<br>as a human I play chess because I enjoy<br>it not because I want to make money by<br>being a great chess<br>player and so the transition of AI in<br>the academy is that the blip of the<br>Industrial Revolution where universities<br>went from being like 4% of the<br>population who just loved learning and<br>loved knowing things and were kind of<br>you know slightly weird because they<br>didn't actually make stuff they just<br>loved to know things right that small 5%<br>of the population who feel that way were<br>going to universities and then somehow<br>somehow we had this information<br>revolution and Technology Revolution<br>where it was some transac actional value<br>and being<br>clever that's going to disappear there<br>will be no transactional value in being<br>clever humans will not be the best way<br>of achieving a cognitive task it will be<br>AI which will then mean that our bubble<br>of suddenly large numbers of people<br>coming to the academy that will<br>disappear we will go back to being 5% of<br>the population who are passionate about<br>learning and who are here because they<br>love internalizing knowledge the academy<br>will be become the gym membership for<br>the mind right it's you do it not<br>because you think I'm going to become<br>strong so I can make money I do it<br>because I love having things in my own<br>head so the effect on teaching and<br>learning is that we move to engaging<br>students we give them motivation to want<br>to learn things but we don't rely on<br>this gatekeeping for a financial future<br>because there is no future financially<br>in being clever it is just just a health<br>and wellbeing of having fun stuff in our<br>own head thank<br>you thanks so much okay so uh next up we<br>have Sarah o Jane o Conor from the<br>School of Science and Society uh a very<br>interesting and relevant school for this<br>particular questions I'm sure you'll<br>agree and uh over to you to think about<br>AI in teaching and learning C<br>ellot Jane to I teach science<br>communication the School of Science and<br>society and unlike uh haven't got quite<br>as much teaching experience as Simon<br>I've only been here since 2020 which you<br>will agree has been a very busy few<br>years with a lots of things changing uh<br>I did manage to teach three weeks in<br>person before he went into lockdown in<br>2020 so I've done a lot of different<br>types of teaching over that time um<br>there was something that Ally said that<br>really connected with me which was<br>thinking about the ways that our<br>disciplines or starting from a place of<br>where our disciplines inform how we are<br>teaching and learning about AI so I<br>teach science communication I have a<br>background in journalism from my<br>personal perspective I'm really scared<br>about what generative AI might mean for<br>both me my discipline but also my<br>friends and my students who are<br>currently or will go into workplaces we<br>we are creatives we create content we<br>write we create podcasts and art and<br>video uh we try and engage people we try<br>to engage the general public with<br>science topics that are sometimes very<br>tricky and complicated and contested we<br>try and meet people with that are in<br>terms of the knowledge that they have<br>the values that they have the worldview<br>that they might be viewing information<br>from and I'm worried about what that<br>means from my own discipline I'm worried<br>about what it means from misinformation<br>because suddenly we have misinformation<br>that can look very polished very tidy<br>and clean and how are we going to know<br>what is real how are we going to be able<br>to discern what information is<br>trustworthy what information we should<br>be relying on when we're making really<br>important decisions about our lives so<br>in science communication I'm thinking<br>about climate change and sustainability<br>and vaccination and how do we help<br>people make those decisions about their<br>own lives um there was something else<br>that Simon said and I think possibly<br>it's because I've come in teaching a<br>different discipline and more recently<br>than you but the the the idea of just<br>imparting knowledge is not something I<br>think about in my teaching and in fact<br>science communication as a discipline<br>has gone through many decades of moving<br>away from what we'd call a knowledge<br>deficit mode so I'm just going to give<br>you information about GE thank you I got<br>a Applause for that um or I'm going to<br>give you information about climate<br>change and you're just going to do what<br>I want you to do that was the trend in<br>science communication for a long time<br>and we are moving away from that we now<br>want to know what people think and value<br>and are concerned about and how do we<br>then shape our communication to best<br>build trust and connection with our<br>audiences um so maybe I'll come in a<br>little bit later but but potentially the<br>the the journey that Simon you're<br>talking about I think might my just<br>displine has been doing for decades and<br>we're already kind of coming so I've<br>come into teaching 25 years after you<br>already thinking about some of that so<br>then when I'm so that that was kind of<br>my perspectives on my discipline but I'm<br>here to talk about teaching so I then<br>have to go into a classroom and decide<br>how I talk to my students about this um<br>and what I've been doing at the moment<br>I'm teaching a third year science<br>communication Capstone course so these<br>students are in their final trimester of<br>their degrees they're very excited to be<br>finished and they're scared about what's<br>coming next whether it's more study or<br>going into the workplace and so just<br>last week we had a conversation in class<br>asking them what they think about Ai and<br>their coursework so I can tell them what<br>I think and they do know what I think<br>trust me I'm very opinionated about<br>things when I need to be but I sat down<br>with this this class and we spent an<br>hour talking about what they think<br>getting them to talk to each other and<br>they told me things like they're worried<br>about um the AI is just going to<br>perpetuate the same biases that um<br>Society Western societies and in<br>particular the Western science has had<br>for many many centuries so in science<br>and Society we're teaching students to<br>be critical about science about the<br>systems that we think and work within<br>and it's really encouraging to me and to<br>my colleagues when our students can then<br>talk really thoughtfully about what<br>their concerns are what does it mean for<br>indigenous knowledge what does it mean<br>for indigenous data sovereignty what<br>does it mean for people's copyright and<br>intellectual property what does it mean<br>for people who are creatives who we<br>still want to to create things and one<br>thing that that has been um banging<br>around in my head is a quos s that um we<br>want AI to do the bad parts of our jobs<br>we don't want it to do the good creative<br>fun parts of our jobs and so as much as<br>I'm excited about some of the um<br>efficiencies that we might gain I still<br>want to protect the work that I do that<br>is fulfilling and enjoyable and creative<br>and allows me to collaborate with my<br>students and my colleagues and our wider<br>um Society the students are also worried<br>about what it means um for them in the<br>workplace they're not sure if it's a Fed<br>at the moment or if it's something<br>that's they're going to be expected to<br>do um the last few weeks we've had uh<br>workplaces coming in to talk to my<br>students and we've been asking them or<br>I've been asking them are you currently<br>using AI in the workplace and at the<br>moment they're not um that's partly<br>because of the kinds of work um<br>workplaces that I work um with so some<br>of you may have been following the New<br>Zealand Heralds um recent AI editorials<br>that have been written and newsrooms are<br>having crisis meetings like these last<br>few weeks about what is the role of AI<br>in their own newsrooms and so I'm um<br>trying to make sure that our students<br>are thinking critically about the use of<br>AI so that they're not um they're able<br>to take the wider learning that we've<br>been doing that critical empathetic<br>value driven thinking and when they do<br>go into workplaces I'm not just training<br>them to do the job or to do the the exe<br>I'm not a vocational um Institute in<br>that sense but I'm hoping that we we're<br>training them to really think and talk<br>and discuss critically about these<br>topics about these tools that will be in<br>their workplaces in some form that we<br>can't actually guess at just yet thank<br>much so in just opening up some of those<br>topics that you've touched on one thing<br>that strikes me is this interesting<br>conversation that we're having with<br>people who are using it whether they're<br>teachers or students<br>um and it's interesting to ask<br>ask rather than just thinking kind of<br>fatalistically about ai ai is coming<br>from Silicon Valley it's arriving down<br>the pipe we can think how would we like<br>it to be what changes would we like to<br>see um what rules would we like to see<br>there what what what's what<br>functionality would we like AI systems<br>to have for instance in teaching and<br>learning and both of you have been<br>thinking about you know some of the<br>things that AI can do I wonder if I can<br>just ask you if you had a kind of list<br>of things of diser that you would like<br>for AI What would you like to see I'm<br>just springing this question on you so<br>uh yeah um it's not currently doing I<br>guess you know yeah so I for me uh I I I<br>value um the ability to to detect<br>misinformation so I'm not actually<br>interested in whether something is<br>written by AI or by a person I want to<br>know if it's true or not right and so<br>for me the truth of information is far<br>more important than the origin of<br>information right so I I don't like that<br>whole like the authority fallacy of<br>going well you know an authority said it<br>so it must be true it's kind of no no I<br>I will critique any information I<br>receive so um for me I think the the<br>skill that an AI could add um the<br>problem with this is every day there are<br>new skills coming about so I don't know<br>what to ask it to do because I'm already<br>exploring what it can currently do and<br>one of the things I really like to do<br>with bias is I push the AI away from a<br>center position so many people when they<br>use AI will just ask it a question so<br>what I say is no no I want your I want<br>the answer to this from five different<br>perspectives so tell me from a<br>Libertarian perspective tell me from a<br>unionist perspective tell me from uh an<br>American perspective tell me from a<br>Chinese perspective I will ask it to<br>take perspectives and move away from the<br>center and I think recognizing the um<br>that it's that it's not supposed to be<br>in the center that's where I'm supposed<br>to be and particularly the thing it<br>doesn't do well now is accurate<br>confidence it sounds confident in<br>everything it says it would be great if<br>AIS were gave more Nuance in their<br>answers around how confident or lack of<br>confidence there should be in the answer<br>they're<br>giving I I think um maybe my my take<br>would be the what you're describing of<br>the the AI kind of meeting in the middle<br>because we don't we're not you're<br>engaging with it critically and that's<br>great but I don't know that how do we<br>how do we get people to be using it in<br>that way so that they are because I<br>could see we were talking in class last<br>week that it could be a way to create an<br>audience member and say all right what<br>does this person want to know what are<br>what are their questions about this<br>topic and then we'll we'll create a<br>communication around it there's ways<br>that it could be really exciting but we<br>still need to know what the models<br>that's been trained on and and what<br>biases it's perpetuating to know to Pro<br>product to make sure that we're getting<br>more than just the meeting in the middle<br>yeah so um in terms of the the the what<br>it's been trained on so one of the<br>interesting projects that we're thinking<br>of doing with Thea is fine-tuning a<br>model on on historical Diaries and then<br>creating a conversation with a<br>historical figure based on their writing<br>so that's retrained so it understands<br>language and then is retrained with<br>their perspectives right to try and<br>create a a simul arum of them so there's<br>some really interesting stuff that you<br>know you could use AI for how many of<br>those historical figures are not white<br>men well they've got a collection of of<br>writings from different people and<br>Diaries from different people so there<br>is some diversity maybe not as much as<br>we would like because we have to<br>acknowledge that in history it was<br>sexist right and you can't just wait<br>what death and assume that you know the<br>the um history<br>didn't require us to fight against those<br>biases<br>so do either of you have something to<br>say just what are we talking about from<br>this I mean what was what was your<br>original<br>question what would I like a to do I<br>mean from a teaching perspective I think<br>one thing is the use of it as and I<br>going to say very carefully as part of<br>tutoring um is a really powerful<br>opportunity because because and it's<br>something I've been sort of triing in my<br>first year course is giving them a chat<br>GPT instance that's been trained on my<br>exercise and they can talk to it I can<br>ask questions and engage with it<br>critically and learn that it will make<br>mistakes and learn to question it and<br>learn through using it how to use it<br>appropriately and especially if you are<br>someone who English is not your first<br>language or you have um different<br>learning requirements to your what Your<br>University is designed for all those<br>people will benefit much more or they<br>will benefit from having these tools<br>where they can say hey explain to me<br>using this language or explain to me uh<br>in a way I can understand based on what<br>you know about me and so to me there's a<br>really big opportunity there to have it<br>as part of our learning experience and<br>then that can free our tuts up to do<br>things like have discussions in labs to<br>you know be available and have those<br>those deeper discussions yeah actually<br>that idea of freeing up the human<br>professionals to do the work that<br>they're supposed to be doing that crops<br>up in an academic environment but also<br>in professional environments for<br>instance you hear this a lot when people<br>are thinking about AI being used in<br>hospitals or in healthc care right the<br>human health workers will be freed up if<br>they're not having to do all this admin<br>stuff and so that's another thought just<br>one thing I'm reflecting on looking at<br>the uh the panelists here um we have<br>panelists who are AI researchers from<br>the School of Engineering and computer<br>science over there and then we have<br>panelists who are from elsewhere in the<br>university and it's an extremely<br>interesting discussion which has to<br>involve technologists but also people<br>who are not technologists because the<br>people who are technologists don't have<br>the necessary skills in the areas of<br>social impact and social science uh to<br>name just a few so it's a very<br>interesting interdisciplinary<br>conversation and I'm glad we have<br>representation unfortunately the AI<br>people on this team do happen to be<br>white men but that's that's often a<br>problem in our school and our discipline<br>that we have to fix somehow but uh<br>anyway um I just wanted to ask brief oh<br>actually we we've run out of time on<br>this one so I think we'll move on to the<br>topic number three here which is AI in<br>knowledge production which is like half<br>of the point of a university um and so a<br>very interesting kind of place to finish<br>with so in this area we're going to<br>start off by asking Alex Bey who's from<br>school of English film theater studies<br>Media communication and art history uh<br>for his view on that because that's<br>where you really might imagine this<br>being The crucial question so please<br>Alex thanks Ellie<br>Alex um I want to start by to to SJ um I<br>agree that sharing knowledge teaching is<br>more than just imparting information uh<br>in my field in media studies and<br>communication it's<br>storytelling um and that's more than<br>just being the smartest person in the<br>room that's understanding about uh<br>telling stories curating information<br>shout out to Librarians here I see you<br>um but I'm Pro AI um and I'm Pro AI<br>because it makes my discipline relevant<br>um which is awesome um I'm a digital<br>media scholar so I'm interested in in<br>apps social media and you can't escape<br>AI when it comes to that sort of thing<br>think about when you search for<br>information when you read the new news<br>there's AI behind that in your news<br>feeds think about when you take a photo<br>with your camera there's AI assisting in<br>the production of that photo um thinking<br>about movies when you choose to watch<br>something on Netflix there's an<br>algorithm that's reading about what<br>you've watched previously that's making<br>a recommendation on what you watch so I<br>think it's critical that we bring to<br>attention those little micro decisions<br>that are influencing our everyday lives<br>and that's what I try to teach my<br>students that AI is already influen<br>seeing the knowledge that we are<br>consuming in society um but by no means<br>should we let AI remain unchecked um I<br>disagree with Simon that the university<br>will become a gym for the mind that<br>sounds very Steve Jobs to me which and<br>we need the Steve Jobs in this world to<br>be very Pro about technology but I don't<br>think AI is going to usurp the economic<br>system I think it generally if left<br>uncheck will extend the economic system<br>in my discipline we study the history of<br>technology in every every single time<br>there's a new technology the internet<br>the printing press television we're like<br>wow oh my God this is amazing this is<br>going to liberate us or enslaving us and<br>what in reality tends to happen is<br>something in the middle it changes what<br>we do but it doesn't tend to change the<br>economics it extends them um and if you<br>take search for example I think we need<br>to politicize how it's changing the way<br>we search or consume information when we<br>used to search for information it was a<br>public good we would go to libraries<br>shout out to Librarians again you know<br>when Google came along it privatized<br>search and it had huge ramifications we<br>need to do the same with AI if AI is<br>replacing search if students young<br>people are using Tik Tok to search for<br>information or or chat gbt what are the<br>implication when searching for<br>information is a for-profit business we<br>need to politicize that and we need to<br>Resource our staff to understand the<br>implications and and to do something<br>about it um and I'm also a little bit<br>tired a little bit tired of this<br>question of whether AI is going to<br>replace humans whether it's more<br>creative than humans I think the more<br>interesting question is how it can<br>extend our humanity and lead to new<br>forms of creativity and I just want to<br>shout out a couple of examples of really<br>awesome AI creativity one that's local<br>and one that's International there was a<br>a Brian Ino documentary that screened<br>last Friday I think at the embassy I<br>didn't get to see it I was already<br>gooded but a good friend of mine told me<br>about it Brian Eno if you don't know is<br>a famous producer um one of the figures<br>behind the ambient music scene in the UK<br>and the director of this documentary um<br>combines over 300 hours of interview<br>footage with with Brian Eno with music<br>videos and other footage but they used a<br>bespoke AI Software System to cut it in<br>a unique way and every time the film is<br>aired it's different they're calling it<br>generative documentary so this is a new<br>type of Storytelling right this is not<br>replacing human creativity it's offering<br>a new type of story telling how cool is<br>that and then here locally in Wellington<br>is this new digital art space called The<br>Grid has anyone been to the Grid on<br>hanning Street it is so cool um the last<br>exhibition was called rivers of wind and<br>for any big wind nerds out there like<br>myself it's super super cool what<br>they've done Delaney James has they've<br>taken eight years of wind data from uh<br>the Wellington airport and condensed it<br>into a 40-minute visual simulation of<br>wind and it's so incredibly immersive<br>and experiential and it's the sort of<br>art that's not possible without advanced<br>computational methods so again it's an<br>example of how creativity can be<br>extended through computation and and and<br>simulation so just want to shout out to<br>that but the important thing is if we<br>want artists and knowledge producers to<br>be able to do that we need to support<br>them we need to Resource them so we need<br>to be talking about open data data<br>Commons and not just put all this data<br>behind priv so I I'll end the a but um<br>yeah thank you thanks so much Alex<br>and very interesting so uh our final<br>panelist on this topic is Tanya Ruka<br>from the school of design and Innovation<br>please<br>tanyao can you hear meone to hear me<br>good um so I agree and to most of my<br>presenters here um I think that it's<br>really important to consider communities<br>of care and AI is a really good<br>opportunity to kind of bring this to the<br>the Forefront of how we're looking after<br>communities um I'm an indigenous<br>contemporary artist um so I work in a<br>communitybased artarts practice and we<br>need support right now I mean as in<br>storytellers artists designers um Ai and<br>generative Ai and all the very varied<br>platforms that are coming out now um you<br>know a couple of seconds and you've got<br>a graphic uh this is something that<br>would have taken a designer at least a<br>few hours days or weeks to develop um<br>and now if you ask for a prompt you can<br>get a more sophisticated short film<br>animation novel Illustrated novel um and<br>also graphic novels are possible now so<br>for us as designers and teaching down at<br>the design school uh this is a big issue<br>and as lecturers we've all got different<br>policies when it comes to using Ai and<br>it's taking us a lot longer to Mark the<br>work because we have to try and see how<br>much AI is involved in the work um so<br>it's it's an unfolding issue um and<br>that's why I say it's really great to<br>think about those communities of care<br>and support and how we're using AI uh so<br>on the flip side of that I'm also<br>executive director for native land<br>digital and we're countermapping<br>indigenous territories around the globe<br>uh so I get to talk to indigenous people<br>a lot about our knowledge systems um and<br>we're actually creating an indigenous<br>data sovereignty treaty in order to use<br>our API and um when you're thinking<br>about knowledge systems and Indigenous<br>knowledge systems a lot of that time<br>there's sacred knowledge that's<br>available now out there on the internet<br>um so many indigenous groups are<br>thinking about right how do we lock down<br>our sacred knowledge but still have it<br>available for the generations that are<br>coming behind us who are more interested<br>in Tik Tok than they are listening to<br>their Elders uh so these are<br>conversations that we're having um a lot<br>uh and there are indigenous groups who<br>are training AI um to recognize the oral<br>story and also their their sacred<br>artworks um so that's really exciting as<br>well and um for myself I spent from 2014<br>I was looking into regeneration and<br>Indigenous knowledge as an Arts<br>practitioner I wanted to actually have<br>some form of um feedback with the<br>environment uh not just make artworks<br>for galleries um so I around 2018 2019 I<br>thought how do we train AI to teach us<br>to have an indigenous<br>mind and I've been waiting lurking in<br>the background for AI to become open<br>source because I work with communities I<br>think everything should be available to<br>communities without<br>resources and every now and then I'll<br>tap into AI what is the Matangi<br>concept and wait for it to feedback ask<br>it how would you use it in the paragraph<br>um and for a long time it kind of didn't<br>make sense it didn't get mangari<br>Concepts at all and it was only fairly<br>recently that I tapped into chat GPT 4.0<br>and asked at I said cured up do you know<br>the meaning of manaki Tonga and it said<br>back to me K and had this huge list of<br>reasoning and it absolutely understood<br>the intrinsic meaning of these words and<br>and I was like do you know<br>Modi yes the life force again massive<br>list of what Modi was um and so I'm like<br>I've designing a cop up a Modi framework<br>if I give you this framework in a<br>graphic can you translate it yes sure I<br>can um comes back all this data making<br>all sorts of connections all sorts of<br>reasoning and I'm like okay can you<br>calculate the Modi of mining on<br>indigenous<br>lands um and it it it fed back um the<br>modim meter was3 for most<br>detrimental um had3 for all of the<br>options except for economic which was<br>negative -2 and it sort of it in its<br>reasoning said that um even though<br>finance will come to indigenous<br>communities potentially that Finance<br>doesn't reach the community itself and<br>then I typed in okay what are the<br>solutions that you would suggest based<br>on this copopa Mal framework and it came<br>back with a really great um balance<br>argument of how contemporary use of<br>technology is dependent on these<br>minerals and Mining um and try to<br>balance it for the indigenous<br>communities um unfortunately it didn't<br>give me back the response I I wanted<br>which<br>was don't mind on indigenous communities<br>but I'm working on it um so yeah that's<br>that's the end of our talk okay thank<br>much so so Tanya I might just start with<br>a question for you um I'm very curious<br>um to know what Mai communities think of<br>this new crazy stuff uh do you have a<br>sense of that I know some some of our<br>colleagues have have have talked a lot<br>about this and I wonder if if you have<br>any thoughts on that yeah I think what<br>what's really exciting is the Innovative<br>thinking that's happening and processing<br>I know there's a lot of excitement<br>because indigenous people globally um<br>see it as an opportunity to disrupt the<br>Western kind of oppressive capitalist<br>systems yeah and there's actually an<br>extremely interesting debate happening<br>at the moment about whether science as a<br>whole not just thinking about AI but<br>predictive models more generally um are<br>going to be a useful instrument uh for<br>for helping disadvantaged communities or<br>or or other groups in New Zealand<br>whether it's low socioeconomic or<br>indigenous or Pacific communities are<br>they going to be an instrument for<br>helping or are they going to be an<br>instrument for perpetuating bias and I<br>think there's a huge kind of like pivot<br>that we can imagine going here and if we<br>push in the right way then they could be<br>very helpful um but let's just come to<br>this question of of creation content<br>more generally<br>um I I wanted to ask would it be useful<br>if we had this is like I'm thinking<br>about something that that I would like<br>to ask for if we had a tool that could<br>tell reliably whether some piece of<br>content whether it's a picture or a text<br>was written by AI or not would this be<br>useful you were mentioning that it takes<br>longer for you to Mark assignments<br>because you've got this extra job so it<br>hasn't removed work from you as a<br>teacher it's giving you extra work but<br>if you had a tool that could reliably<br>say yep human generated no this is<br>completely AI generated or here's<br>something in between would that be<br>useful for you guys I think it would be<br>like turn it in very useful what you<br>Reon yeah I mean in my last uh class I'm<br>getting my students to create an<br>explainer video to explain you know<br>pretty dense media theories and and we<br>compared a previously submitted human<br>version to a an AI generated one and it<br>was actually quite a fun exercise to<br>push the tool and and to compare the two<br>um and let's just say the human one was<br>far better um but yeah I think those<br>tools would be useful I know that<br>they're really hard to to um be accurate<br>though aren't they yeah they are so um<br>I'm wondering do when you were talking<br>in your uh presentation you mentioned<br>that there need to be checks or<br>something there are checks on the<br>technology do you think there's any Tech<br>uses here that should be simply banned I<br>know that you know every so often in our<br>in our uh sort of Technology there are<br>things that we can do for instance<br>cloning or this new issue of like uh<br>actually what you can do in genetic<br>engineering which is completely relevant<br>today given the announcement this<br>morning um things that we can do we can<br>but we choose not to do you think<br>there's anything like that in this area<br>of AI and I also like to throw this<br>question out uh to the people who are<br>listening if you have questions hold on<br>to them and then you can come and talk<br>to the panelists at at the end of the<br>hour so please uh you remember the<br>questions you have and come and talk<br>but I mean yes this is something that<br>the EU act the EU AI Act is taking a<br>risk management approach right and and I<br>guess when the stakes are really high so<br>and you electoral campaigns political<br>ads you know we all know what happened<br>in the United States in 2016 when social<br>media was involved allegedly in the<br>election of of a certain someone um so<br>you know misinformation can become even<br>more powerful and damaging when AI is is<br>is powering it so certainly yeah yeah<br>it's actually useful for you to mention<br>social media there because that's the<br>whole of social media is powered by AI<br>the recommend algorithm that throws<br>items into your news feed or recommends<br>Spotify movies or Netflix Spotify songs<br>or Netflix movies talking of content<br>creation those recommend algorithms<br>literally are machine learning devices<br>of the sort that us uh engineering<br>people teach to our students it<br>literally observes each user and sees<br>what they're interested in what they<br>click on and then learns what they click<br>on and then gives them more of the same<br>so there's AI in a lot of the things<br>that we're doing you know for several<br>hours a day and and uh there's<br>influences that arise through there as<br>well that go Way Beyond the Academy I<br>suppose I just wanted to mention that<br>but I guess uh we're coming to the end<br>of the hour I'd like to just ask uh are<br>there any other thoughts and in<br>particular what else can can Vic be<br>doing what else should we be doing<br>should we have new courses should there<br>be new training for students are then<br>new as student graduate attributes um<br>where are we and what else can we do I<br>suppose should we go down the line or<br>yeah let's let's have everyone say<br>something there's a way of finishing off<br>I I I I don't have a good reputation of<br>microphones um I I think to me one of<br>the key things is that people graduating<br>should have an understanding of what AI<br>can do at at the moment and also have<br>built up an ability to critique it and<br>to critique the use of it and so that<br>goes beyond just using the tool to be<br>able to analyze the propos and cons the<br>sort of societal impacts and so on and<br>that requires both some fundamental<br>knowledge of some of the basic ideas in<br>AI but also that sort of critic and<br>conscience Society role that we as<br>academics have I think that needs to be<br>extended to our students more and more<br>because issues like misinformation<br>disinformation bias and so on is not<br>something we can also but we need our<br>graduates to also be tackling that and<br>be aware of<br>that yeah I think you've summed that up<br>really well um I would be advocating for<br>just continuing to teach students<br>critical thinking um and critical use of<br>AI um equally as researchers should be<br>um tackling that that<br>question so um some of the research when<br>they introduce AI into a business is<br>that if you teach everybody how to use<br>their Ai and you make it equally<br>available then it actually lifts the<br>weaker employees and the new employees<br>more than the senior employees however<br>if you just lay a fear and let whoever<br>wants to use it use it however they want<br>the more advanced staff use it more<br>effectively than the weaker staff so the<br>only way to actually address the<br>inequalities that AI is going to<br>introduce would be by us actively<br>teaching how to use it critically and so<br>we need to engage and be teaching<br>students this stuff not just hope that<br>it will magically work out outside and<br>once they go into industry we'll teach<br>them fundamentals and somehow that will<br>help them use AI well so I think we need<br>to embrace the teaching of how you use<br>AI<br>effectively um I think I think in terms<br>of what Vic should be doing or could be<br>doing is um going back to your earlier<br>question Ally that we're not going to be<br>able to detect it we're not going to be<br>able to block it even if we tell<br>students not to use it it'll be within<br>grammarly it'll be within Google search<br>and and so thinking about the ways that<br>we are talking to students that aren't<br>just telling them don't use it so what I<br>forgot to say is the reason my course<br>and I were having this conversation last<br>week is because I've decided that we're<br>going to co-produce our course policy<br>about AI rather than me tell them this<br>is what you can use it for and so really<br>um engaging with students in how we<br>teach them and how we talk to them about<br>it and making sure that they're part of<br>the conversation as well that we're not<br>just enforcing something top<br>down C I'm just going to talk you I<br>think empowering our students to come up<br>with their own ideas and policies let's<br>do this bottom up y<br>yep yeah I think that's the same for me<br>as well is just they have to know how to<br>use these tools because that's what's<br>being used out there in in the industry<br>so just how they think about the work<br>that they make is so<br>important um that point you made Alex<br>about bottom up it's so important the<br>the gra the Optics of this where you<br>have a a panel of experts talking to<br>everyone else is entirely wrong of<br>course there has to be information about<br>how it works and how it's being used but<br>there also needs to be information<br>coming from citizens and from students<br>and from everyone that come literally<br>from the use cases and from users and<br>that's just as important if not more<br>important as we can make this work but I<br>just want to finish by saying it's<br>really obvious to me that the natural<br>unit for discussion about AI like in the<br>University here is not a school it's not<br>a department it's not a faculty it's the<br>university as a whole whole and that's<br>you know the right unit for discussion<br>here because this is so<br>interdisciplinary and I wish that we'd<br>had people also from the faculties of<br>law down in in PIP and from the the<br>schools of government and so on because<br>they're relevant too this is genuinely a<br>matter of discussion for the whole<br>university and I think with that can we<br>thank you all it remains my happy duty<br>to um very briefly sum up and to to<br>thank everybody so in the spirit of this<br>being a collaborative debate I I felt I<br>should concentrate on the points that<br>the panel all agreed on in the research<br>space Ally and Andrew both referenced<br>the efficiency that AI can bring uh<br>particularly with the uh example of a<br>literature review and that caused me to<br>recall the um quote by Matt Alverson in<br>his book on social science called the<br>return to meaning where he said um never<br>before has so much been written by so<br>many saying so little and read by so few<br>um and and as such the temptation to use<br>uh generative AI to to generate<br>literature reviews and Grant<br>applications which actually I do enjoy<br>writing um is very tempting so how how<br>do we ensure that the criticality the<br>ethics and the Integrity are are always<br>woven through our activities Simon and<br>Sarah Jane both uh both mentioned in a<br>lot of ways the EV evolution of teaching<br>from the sage on the stage through the<br>guide on the side and now into a space<br>of uh where we Inspire Learners um where<br>the Academy I like this quote even<br>though Alex didn't is the gym membership<br>for the mind uh and as Sarah Jane<br>clearly showed the anxiety that we feel<br>and that our students feel is um to a<br>certain extent delayed by the the<br>critical thinking skills that the Mind<br>gym the university is imparting and and<br>finally Alex and Tanya you both<br>highlighted the role of Storytelling in<br>our Collective increase and<br>understanding and it was only a few<br>years ago possibly only a year ago where<br>people would have doubted the ability of<br>generative AI to be a compelling<br>Storyteller but in the same way that we<br>went what 63 years from the right<br>Brothers to Neil Armstrong chat GPT is<br>uh going through the same sort of<br>acceleration but as as Alex pointed out<br>that the existential fear we have when<br>faced with technology well if you were<br>going to extrapolate the space Landing<br>we'd all be teleporting by now so things<br>are going to level out and and the most<br>important thing that we can all do as as<br>the university as staff as students as<br>alumni and as the community is lean into<br>that critical thinking the ethics the<br>integrity and as Ally put it the<br>transparency of how we use AI so that is<br>enough of a summary for me it just<br>remains for me to thank our panelists to<br>thank our MC to thank the organizers and<br>the events team and to thank the<br>audience here today and to invite you<br>all to join us for refreshments and to<br>uh continue the conversation with the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
