a<br>reasonably well-known ataro alumnus who<br>recently returned to the university<br>after a lengthy career in<br>politics The Honorable Grant Robertson<br>spent 15 years as a member of parliament<br>before becoming a taro's vice Chancellor<br>last month born in palson North Grant<br>moved to dened with his family in the<br>late<br>1970s and attended King's high<br>school he began studying at the UN<br>University of tago in<br>1990 where he earned a Bachelor of Arts<br>with honors and political<br>science well at the University he was<br>heavily involved in student Politics as<br>president of the ataga University<br>Students<br>Association his passion for student<br>advocacy continued after he graduated as<br>the vice president and then co-president<br>of the New Zealand University Students<br>Association before stepping into<br>Parliament Grant's career included<br>working for the New Zealand Ministry of<br>Foreign Affairs and trade being an<br>adviser to former prime minister Helen<br>Clark and indeed he worked for the<br>University of ital Cho as the business<br>development manager in the University's<br>research and Enterprise<br>office Grant was New Zealand's Deputy<br>Prime Minister for three years and our<br>Minister of Finance for six he led the<br>country's economic response during the<br>covid-19 pandemic which included<br>significant work to support businesses<br>and<br>workers given his love for sport his<br>appointment as the minister of sport and<br>Recreation was the perfect fit<br>at that time he was at the Forefront of<br>the country's first strategy for women<br>and girls in sport and<br>Recreation which increased the profile<br>of female Sport and the number of women<br>and girls participating in sport and<br>coaching earlier this year after his<br>success in politics he was ready for a<br>new challenge and decided it was time to<br>come home on behalf of the council I was<br>delighted that the University was able<br>to both offer and capture that<br>opportunity<br>Grant please join me in welcoming The<br>Honorable Grant Robertson to deliver the<br>thank you uh Chancellor for your welcome<br>and to break with tradition I want to<br>take a brief moment at the outset of<br>this speech to acknowledge that Steven<br>higs is on his final day of graduations<br>as Chancellor next month Steven Steven<br>will step down after 12 years on the<br>University Council and the last two and<br>a half in the role as Chancellor now I<br>know that names like Chancellor and vice<br>chancellors make a sound to some of you<br>like a cross between a Marvel movie and<br>Harry Potter and to be honest this<br>robee's not really helping in that<br>regard but Steven is essentially the<br>chair of the board the person who leads<br>the governing body of the University his<br>Steady Hand and total commitment to the<br>goals and purposes of the University of<br>Oto have been vital in the ongoing<br>success of the University I particularly<br>want to acknowledge Steven for his<br>leadership in finalizing Pata the<br>University's strategic plan that sets<br>ambitious goals for our University<br>including to be a truly globally<br>connected University to have Equitable<br>outcomes for all our students and to be<br>a Teti lead University thank you Steven<br>on behalf of the whole university<br>contribution I also need to thank stepen<br>for being the person who called me<br>earlier this year to tell me that I had<br>got the job of Vice Chancellor<br>essentially chief executive of the<br>University of otago one of the greatest<br>honors of my working life<br>graduates as you've already heard I sat<br>where you are 29 years ago at what I<br>thought was the end of my otago journey<br>I had loved my time as a student uh<br>getting that degree in political studies<br>and I also took a practical break in the<br>middle of that with a spell as the<br>president of our USA it was a time of<br>significant political upheaval at the<br>University upfront fees were introduced<br>for the first time initially with no<br>loan scheme and then with a loan scheme<br>that saw us charge 9% interest on our<br>loans fees went up by 15% in the year I<br>was president and then 18% the next year<br>now i' tell you that not in a classic<br>you think you've got it tough old man<br>way but actually to explain why I<br>protested so much and why I spent a lot<br>of time telling the vice chancelor how<br>to do his job I do recall a senior<br>police officer calling me quote the<br>biggest quasi terrorist in<br>denan I told him I was trying to lose<br>weight but now here I am as Vice<br>Chancellor and I guess that is what they<br>call<br>Karma in fact I'm here because my otago<br>journey did not end in<br>1995 and I hope for you graduates it<br>does not end today after walking across<br>the stage your place in the otago family<br>is cemented in you are part of a rich<br>Legacy of graduates who have led and<br>shaped our country and world you have<br>also made friends for life and<br>connections that you will come back to<br>time and time again and this is not some<br>nostalgic cliche it's certainly my<br>experience and I know it is that of<br>thousands of<br>others in his book ritual song of<br>Defiance the first history of O USA Sam<br>elworthy talked about a spirit that<br>floats across the leaf and down through<br>the campus and draws you in for my part<br>I can say that it has always done that<br>and I hope that you will continue to<br>feel that your time here as a student<br>may be completed but your place at otago<br>is here for you<br>forever to all our graduates here today<br>congratulations on your achievements you<br>cannot get here without putting in some<br>hard yards this is a pinnacle day and<br>you deserve to be proud of yourself for<br>all that you have done to reach this<br>peak I also want to take a moment to<br>congratulate and acknowledge your Foo<br>today family and friends thank you for<br>your support that has enabled this<br>day now in these speeches we are asked<br>to try to give you one piece of advice<br>that you can take away with you for the<br>rest of your life I'm already too late<br>to give you my main piece of advice<br>about the act of graduation itself don't<br>break up with your boyfriend the night<br>before have a few drinks to commiserate<br>and then spend the whole ceremony<br>wanting to be<br>sick if there is anyone in the audience<br>currently feeling that way I appreciate<br>you and no one will notice if you have<br>to pop out for some fresh<br>air actually if there is one thing I<br>have had reaffirmed returning to aaga<br>for this role is that I'm not really in<br>a position position to give specific<br>advice to you all a lot changes in 29<br>years and the experience of students<br>today is vastly different from what I<br>had all those years ago now some things<br>are still the same it's very hard to get<br>a seat in the library at exam time and<br>people have their regular spots which<br>are guarded like Mount Doom and the<br>recipe for the pies at the University<br>Union cafes has not changed if you got<br>through your degree without trying the<br>chicken s I'm truly sorry for you but<br>many many things are different you are<br>growing up in a world that is more<br>fastpaced where there does seem to be<br>pressure to do more be more and record<br>everything it's a cliche I know but<br>social media has changed<br>everything I have a friend whose father<br>served in World War II he was an older<br>dad he was born in the 1920s and he died<br>in<br>2007 his name was Bob and he actually<br>attended otago as as an adult student in<br>his retirement after having left school<br>at<br>13 Bob once said to me that there were<br>three inventions in his lifetime that<br>had fundamentally changed the world the<br>jet engine the computer and the<br>contraceptive pill you can see where<br>Bob's priorities<br>lay now if I'm making that list for me<br>and that could be a fun thing for you to<br>do now if you're finding my speech a bit<br>less than interesting then one thing<br>would be on there ahead of all else the<br>smartphone has changed everything it<br>would be fair to say that I might not<br>have had a political career had one<br>existed during my time at<br>University social media is a byproduct<br>of an instant world where it can feel<br>like you are on show<br>247 graduates you are also entering a<br>world that can feel like it is in<br>Perpetual crisis you are the graduates<br>of the co pandemic and I do want to<br>acknowledge that for a moment your<br>University career and possibly the end<br>of your schooling was in the shadow of<br>Co and that has meant that You' have had<br>a different experience perhaps you feel<br>that you missed out on some things as a<br>result all I can do is say thank you for<br>sticking with it and for playing your<br>part in any event I do not presuppose to<br>know how your world will turn out or<br>what your perspective will be 29 years<br>after you graduate but of course I'm an<br>expolit I I've got some<br>reckons now we get given 8 minutes for<br>these speeches and I've already used<br>most of mine so what follows are eight<br>reckons from me that you can use as a<br>kind of alart menu and then choose one<br>that you tell other people<br>about number one you are going to work<br>with people that dis that you disagree<br>with now that might seem like an obvious<br>thing for a politician to say and I'm<br>not even talking about the other parties<br>in<br>Parliament I don't have any particular<br>special advice for you on how to handle<br>that but just be ready for it number two<br>work outside your lane if we're going to<br>solve The World's messy problems it's<br>only going to happen if we break down<br>some barriers the solutions to The<br>Climate crisis are in this room and in<br>the next group of graduates who come<br>through here at 4 p.m. we need the<br>lawyers to make sure that we have the<br>framework to reduce our emissions the<br>Commerce graduates to sort out climate<br>financing the philosophers to understand<br>the ethics of our decisions the medical<br>graduates to understand the health<br>impacts the scientists to help find the<br>mitigation strategies it's one of my<br>goals as Vice Chancellor of this<br>University that we be at The Cutting<br>Edge of addressing the world's biggest<br>challenges and we will only do that if<br>we break down the silos across our<br>disciplines and you can lead that in<br>your working life number three<br>to toy<br>Al number four always remember to call<br>your mom or any other important woman in<br>your life I'm not just saying that<br>because my mom is here today but because<br>I can guarantee you that as you get<br>older it is one thing that you will<br>never ever<br>regret five slow down that's it that's<br>the<br>message six if you work in an office get<br>to know the cleaners or if you don't<br>work in an office the people who make<br>your coffee always thank the bus driver<br>I have never met a person who did not<br>appreciate being appreciated and you<br>will learn something special I guarantee<br>it seven apply for roles even if you<br>them you never know where you might end<br>up and in an act of extreme mansplaining<br>I say that especially to the women who<br>are graduating today men do most things<br>without thinking about<br>them that is not always a good thing but<br>when it comes to putting ourselves<br>forward where there is uncertainty it is<br>worth doing and finally eighth Anything<br>Can Happen what happens for you from<br>here is not going to go to plan there<br>will be setbacks Global pandemics you'll<br>meet a guy named Winston who says he<br>wants to help you oh sorry that's<br>a that's a different speech<br>sorry but anything can happen and so the<br>thought that I do want to leave you with<br>is that the best that you can do in the<br>face of all the uncertainty and<br>unpredictability in the circus that is<br>Modern Life is hang on to your<br>values hang on to what you have learned<br>at aaku faka<br>ihaka make time for<br>yourself make space for difference
