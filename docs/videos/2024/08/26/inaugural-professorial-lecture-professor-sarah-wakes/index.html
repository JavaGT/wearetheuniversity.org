Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>Mari here at the University of otago and<br>on behalf of the senior leadership team<br>I welcome you all here this evening to<br>this very special event to Mark and<br>celebrate the promotion of Professor<br>position I acknowledge all our<br>colleagues and visitors here in person<br>and those online who are gathered<br>together to celebrate All Professor<br>Sarah wakes has achieved in her<br>remarkable career to this point and this<br>is such a special occasion for us all<br>and for you Sarah<br>and I especially acknowledge uh your<br>husband your husband ni theobold and<br>good friends Kath Dickinson Linda D and<br>Donna Kean who are here with us this<br>evening and there are many joining us<br>online this evening and I want to<br>especially acknowledge uh your family in<br>the United Kingdom including your mom<br>Jillian wakes your brother Chris wakes<br>and sister-in-law Sam and to your<br>friends in ockland Wellington and the UK<br>and the USA so there is a big online<br>audience for this evening this occasion<br>this evening represents years and years<br>of high-profile research teaching and<br>Service as an applied mathem<br>mathematician and engineer Professor<br>wakes has contributed enormously to new<br>knowledge in this country and<br>internationally and one of the roles of<br>a university is to help positively<br>transformed Society in your<br>multidisciplinary expertise to provide<br>insight into advancing engineering<br>design fluid dynamics and sustainability<br>is truly remarkable and his deservedly<br>led to many recognitions including<br>fellow of the engineering in New Zealand<br>Professor wakes I also take um this<br>moment to acknowledge your leadership um<br>and all you have achieved here at the<br>University of otago it is my greatest<br>Delight to stand here with you this<br>evening to mark this substantial<br>occasion in your career and I'm now<br>going to hand over to the Pro Vice<br>Chancellor of Sciences Professor Richard<br>barer to more fully introduce you our<br>T Professor Ru T Professor Wes<br>ten Professor Bryant ten friends and<br>colleagues tenot taroto<br>taroto it is my pleasure to introduce<br>our speaker tonight Professor Sarah<br>wakes from the Department of Mathematics<br>and statistics to give her an augural<br>professorial lecture here at the<br>University of otago as indicated by<br>Professor Ruru Sarah was promoted to<br>Professor in February this year and<br>tonight we get to celebrate this<br>significant achievement born in woking s<br>in the UK Professor wakes grew up on the<br>outskirts of London and attended the<br>Collingwood comprehensive School<br>excelling in mathematics from an early<br>age she was in an accelerated maths<br>stream that not only had some amazing<br>teachers in it which fostered her love<br>of mathematics but it was also a source<br>of relaxation or Recreation Sarah<br>reports that she used to differentiate<br>to<br>relax Sarah's dad was an electrical<br>engineer and he also had a passion for<br>cars two things that he has passed on to<br>his daughter Sarah reports that her<br>initial ambition was to be an astronaut<br>but her fear of heights got in the<br>way on leaving High School Sarah headed<br>off to the University of Nottingham for<br>joint honors in science and<br>physics and in her third year A Course<br>in fluid dynamics caught her interest<br>and this eventually led to her PhD also<br>at Nottingham where she looked at two-<br>layed flows over San Junes after a stint<br>as a research officer with the ministry<br>of Defense between honors in her PhD and<br>she tells me I'm she there's nothing she<br>can say that she did during that time<br>that we can use<br>legally Professor wakes had the research<br>bug and on graduating with her PhD she<br>took on the role of research instituted<br>uh re research assistant at lury<br>University of Technology in the<br>department of me mechanical engineering<br>and then there was a 10year stent as a<br>research fellow at the University of<br>Herford herfer in the department of<br>Aerospace mechanic iCal and civil<br>engineering this was at a time when<br>computing power was really starting to<br>grow and computational fluid dynamics<br>was starting to become<br>possible in 2002 Professor wakes<br>answered the irresistible call to move<br>to denan and she took on a role as a<br>fixed term senior lecturer in the<br>department of design studies recognized<br>for her administrative talents this<br>quickly turned into a one-year stint as<br>acting H for before reverting to her<br>fixed term role which then became<br>permanent<br>2008 Sarah became the head of the<br>Department of design studies which 3<br>years later was restructured into the<br>department of applied science with Sarah<br>as Deputy head before this department<br>turned into the center for Material<br>Science and Technology with Sarah as<br>director from 2018 to<br>2019 before the center was<br>disestablished and Sarah moved across to<br>her now permanent home in the Department<br>of Mathematics and statistics which she<br>has led since 2020<br>as indicated by Professor Ruru promotion<br>to full professor at the University of<br>otago is far from easy and one must<br>excel in all three academic domains of<br>research teaching and service and Sarah<br>has excelled driven by her interests in<br>engineering design fluid dynamics and<br>sustainability she is an expert in<br>computational fluid dynamics with a<br>particular focus on applications of flow<br>simulation to engineering design and<br>wind Dynamics over complex Coastal<br>geomorphology<br>after all a sand junee and an AA foil of<br>related<br>structures she has published extensively<br>with 92 referee Journal articles and<br>Conference proceedings and she has been<br>awarded more than $15 million in<br>research grants across a number of<br>distinct application areas including the<br>use of coffee grounds in sustainable and<br>efficient product for decom<br>decontamination of nitrate polluted<br>water the use of offshore mobile<br>technology to transform finfish ction as<br>well as predicting wind flow and<br>sediment transport across vegetated<br>sandun systems which of course was her<br>PhD research<br>area This research has been externally<br>recognized Sarah has been a charted<br>engineer and Marine engineer for almost<br>all of her career and in 2022 was made a<br>fellow of engineering New Zealand for<br>the impact of her work it has proven<br>especially valuable in environments<br>where it is difficult to gather field<br>data Professor W's academic career is<br>also noteworthy for the large number of<br>postgraduate students that she has<br>supervised which to date includes 14<br>phdd students and 16 Master students<br>which brings me to the second domain of<br>teaching from early in her career<br>Professor wakes has been committed to<br>her teaching having taught fluid<br>dynamics and automotive design while at<br>the University of herfordshire when it<br>comes to teaching Sarah is an<br>experimentalist and has been successful<br>in getting Grant applications to support<br>her teaching Innovations this includes a<br>a uh a Cel Grant in 2009 using copopa<br>moldi process and communication design<br>and more recently one in 2020 titled I<br>do I understand engaging distance and<br>campus students in sustainability<br>through Active Learning the second Grant<br>has informed the Innovative matx 204<br>paper treasure or trash sustainability<br>of materials of which Sarah can be<br>rightfully proud for its popularity with<br>students this brings me to the final<br>domain of service to the academic and<br>professional community and I really need<br>to hand over to Sarah there is so much<br>to go through that I've decided I'll<br>just concentrate on her University<br>Service and just pick out some<br>highlights she's an alumnus of the New<br>Zealand woman and Leadership program and<br>now is a mentor on the division of<br>Sciences academic board sorry a mentor<br>in that program and is on the division<br>of Sciences academic board and standing<br>committee for and for those who are in<br>the know it's the standing committee<br>that does the heavy lifting on on our<br>academic U program<br>assessments she's in the academic<br>development leadership program Advisory<br>Board she's on the sustainability<br>strategic framework Advisory Group the<br>environmental sustainabil ability<br>Advisory Group University Senate and she<br>has been active in helping co-design the<br>University of sorry the division of<br>Sciences Equity diversity and inclusion<br>strategy I've already mentioned her<br>various terms is acting in substantive<br>terms as HD while here at otaro what I<br>didn't mention but you could probably<br>work out these were challenging times as<br>the Departments concerned went through a<br>series of restructurings and ultimately<br>disestablishment this would have been<br>highly unsettling for Sarah and I just<br>want to add a personal thank you for the<br>dignified way in which you act acted<br>through this tumultuous<br>period my last remark but far from the<br>least is that Sarah is the first woman<br>to lead the Department of Mathematics<br>and Mathematics and statistics in the<br>150 plus years of this University to<br>which we can only say about<br>time speaking of time it is now time to<br>hear from Professor wakes herself one of<br>our Stell woman in science here at the<br>University of otago please join me in<br>welcoming Professor Sarah wakes<br>thank you very much C and Professor Ruru<br>and Professor Barker lovely<br>emotional haa Mana<br>haao haa Kang Mah K far<br>tanoto<br>kotoo<br>Kang<br>Teno no Teno Teno<br>Teno uh Co curly Hill uh to M KS to a<br>coari co co Jillian wakes Ru Co Thomas<br>wakes OK mat Co Sarah wakes too wi thank<br>you very<br>much okay so hopefully you're going to<br>enjoy the story of how I got here and I<br>always think a good IPL should start<br>with a good picture and it's not this<br>one although it is quite nice and I'll<br>explain the car a little bit later<br>on I'm going to start with my mom<br>actually so uh one of the things um you<br>might not know is that I'm actually<br>first in family um and first in my wide<br>not just my immediate family but first<br>in um all of my cousins to go to<br>university and in fact I'm not sure I<br>know of anybody um that's not my<br>generation that didn't go to university<br>so starting with my mom she's the one in<br>pink chillian this she's here with her<br>mom and her sister and mom went to a<br>grammar school um in she lived in rural<br>s for most of her life part from um most<br>of her childhood apart from when she was<br>evacuated to Wales to live with family<br>during the war um but she had to leave<br>school at 16 because she had to earn<br>money um her family couldn't afford for<br>her to stay at school until she was 18<br>and maybe go to university and I'm<br>absolutely convinced that she could have<br>gone to University so she actually<br>didn't just leave school she actually<br>left home she actually went up to London<br>which at the time it doesn't look very<br>far from that red dot to London but you<br>know in 19 when whatever it was um it<br>was just after the war it was um a big<br>deal um to leave home so she went from<br>rural sari into London and she lived in<br>a a women's hostel and she worked in the<br>tax office which she absolutely loved so<br>um I think my love of numbers partly<br>came from my<br>mom and then there's my dad so my dad<br>was born and grew up in Bolton which is<br>near Manchester and it's a Cotton Mill<br>Town his mom worked in the cotton mill<br>um and I suspect other relatives further<br>back worked in the cotton Mills and in<br>fact my name wakes my surname it's a<br>very unusual name I'm the only one in<br>New Zealand and there's only about 12<br>people in the UK who have that s name<br>and it actually comes from the fact that<br>my great great-grandfather was found on<br>the steps of an orphanage during a wakes<br>week now wakes weeks were M holidays<br>they were introduced during the<br>Industrial Revolution when the law came<br>in that their hats be holidays for the<br>workers you know there had to be sort of<br>good you know rights you know for the<br>workers so he was named wakes after the<br>wakes week so we have a very strong<br>connection to Cotton and the Mills and<br>actually it was only I'm ashamed to say<br>this when I worked at the University of<br>Harford Shire that I discovered that<br>actually my name is an apamin and if for<br>those of you who don't know it it's um a<br>name that sort of describes someone's<br>job or what they they do I actually had<br>a dentist when I was a child called Mr<br>sweet which I thought was hysterical and<br>so it's similar to that so anyway back<br>to my dad uh the top picture is bar<br>bridge which is the small village and<br>the foot of Winter Hill which is um part<br>of the sort of penines um and where Dad<br>um sort of spent some of his time as a<br>young child and that picture actually uh<br>the small boy on the right is my dad<br>with his sisters and a friend um he went<br>to Technical College but left at age 50<br>again because you know he had to ear<br>money for his family he was Apprentice<br>to a clock and watchmaker in Bolton and<br>one of his first jobs was winding the<br>mill clocks really important job because<br>everyone had to clock in and out so they<br>had to be accurate of course that wasn't<br>enough for him and he had to go and do<br>his national service and the picture on<br>the right is him um as a radio operator<br>for the Royal engineers in jalter which<br>he did I think for a couple of years<br>loved it came back applied for a couple<br>of jobs had two interviews in London one<br>I think was for the Civil Service one<br>was for the BBC being a canny Lancashire<br>lad he took the BBC one because they<br>paid better expenses and they paid them<br>immediately and that was really his<br>career he worked for the BBC he went in<br>as an apprentice engineer this was him<br>actually during his engineering training<br>they were training cameramen and so he<br>was taking the part of the presenter he<br>wasn't actually a presenter<br>he uh took a diploma he he got the<br>equivalent of a degree in electrical<br>engineering through sort of doing night<br>school and working really hard when I<br>was actually um when he was first<br>married and I was a young child uh he<br>went on to do special projects with the<br>BBC so he every two years he would go<br>off to the Olympics or the Commonwealth<br>Games to look after their OB units and<br>we would go to Wales on holiday I never<br>thought that was fair when he was going<br>to well maybe Moscow wasn't so good but<br>Los Angeles brid Brisbane you know all<br>those exotic places so definitely I got<br>my love as Richard said of cars and<br>numbers and Engineering from from my dad<br>as<br>well this is what you've all been<br>waiting for you obviously have to have a<br>picture of a small child of you as a<br>small child in your<br>IPL so yes I grew up in mostly in zui<br>and I think you probably can tell I was<br>a fiery red head I was stubborn uh I<br>think lots of people around me today<br>would say I was still that um and as<br>Richard said I did have Ambitions to be<br>an astronaut when I was quite small but<br>being scared of heights was quite a<br>problem but that I didn't let that stop<br>me going and enjoying maths and doing<br>physics and that led me to the<br>University of Nottingham doing maths and<br>physics uh as I say first in family uh<br>this is just a picture of the University<br>Trent building and the bottom one was a<br>few years ago we went back to visit I<br>went and sat in almost exactly the same<br>position that I always sat in the<br>electure theater we are creatures of<br>habit I'm sure you're doing the same at<br>the moment um absolutely fantastic time<br>away from home you know really<br>blossoming although the electronics<br>project in the Physics degree did almost<br>kill me let me tell you I'm not doing<br>Electronics<br>again so then I got my first job I<br>worked for radi for the ministry of<br>Defense that's a royal defense an<br>Armament establishment in<br>Kent but unfortunately if I tell you<br>what I did I'm going to have to kill you<br>because I'm not allowed I've signed the<br>official Secrets act but needless to say<br>it did two things it did introduce me to<br>modeling and it fueled my ambition to<br>actually do something more I didn't want<br>to be in that job as a research<br>scientist all my life I wanted to do<br>something more and do research so it<br>took me back to not him um and I had a<br>fantastic time I did my PhD in an<br>engineering faculty in theoretical<br>mechanics it was a breakaway Mass<br>Department um it really established my<br>love of cars of bikes and of music and<br>uh I've got a really close group of<br>friends and it established my love of<br>Minis and I wish that was my motorbike<br>it wasn't I had a much more clapped out<br>yeah I then got a job after I did an OE<br>as a research fellow at hartfordshire<br>and this is where I really started<br>honing in on my research area that I<br>continue today I was lucky enough to do<br>a little bit of work with Brian Spalding<br>those of you INF fluids will know him he<br>um developed um some really key sort of<br>theories and uh practical models that we<br>use today but he also established the<br>first commercial computational flow<br>Dynamics code Phoenix um and I was lucky<br>enough to meet<br>him the other really good thing about<br>working at Harford here was um that I<br>did a lot of work on um connected with<br>the offshore oil industry and that<br>really came after the piper Alpha<br>disaster in 1988 when um a good number<br>of people were killed they weren't<br>killed by the fire they were killed by<br>the fact they couldn't get back to their<br>safe haven which is the accommodation<br>block usually on a offshore oil rig<br>quickly enough the toxic gases overtook<br>them and they actually died in that way<br>so there was a lot of changes to<br>regulations because of what happened on<br>Piper Alpha and I was lucky enough to be<br>seconded to Norway for 3 months and work<br>um on the design of nshore oil rig there<br>um to make sure that these safety<br>requirements were really um you know up<br>to scratch and I also had a chance to do<br>a little bit of teaching there as well<br>and Branch out into automotive design<br>very interesting paper and obviously<br>fluids<br>so the wind it blew me it blew me from<br>Harford cheer to<br>deden um and as Richard said design<br>studies I brought the engineering into<br>the design for technology<br>major so that's sort of the blackground<br>I'm going to now sort of take you<br>through a little bit if you don't know<br>what flu Dynamics is and I'm using my<br>favorite one of my favorite things in<br>the world which is Formula 1 I'm a big<br>Formula 1 fan as you might be able to<br>tell so fluid dynamics is it's really<br>about a fluid a fluid can be a gas or a<br>liquid and how it flows either over<br>something or through something and we<br>see four examples here of different ways<br>in which we can measure and look at how<br>a fluid flows over something we might<br>put instruments in this case on a car<br>top left hand picture these are Arrow<br>rakes each of those little spikes is um<br>a Pito tube it's a it measures pressure<br>and from that we can determine the wind<br>speed that gives us a picture of what's<br>going on behind those wheels and behind<br>the car we see the green paint That's<br>Flo's paint it's like a very oily thin<br>um obviously fluorescent um paint the<br>track goes you know car goes around the<br>track a couple of times and we get a<br>lovely picture we hope on the car and<br>that gives us an idea of what's going on<br>on the surface of the car bottom left<br>that's um prototype car in a wind tunnel<br>and we can see they're blowing smoke<br>over it so we can get some idea of you<br>know what the flow structures are and of<br>course it will be instrumented up as<br>well and of course my favorite the<br>modeling side the cfd side um where we<br>use uh we solve the equations that that<br>uh describe fluid flow um and we can get<br>this lovely 3D picture um of what the<br>flow is doing and the reality is that<br>the reality is somewhere in the middle<br>of all of those none of those actually<br>measure really what's happening if we're<br>putting an instrument into a flow it's<br>interfering with the flow the modeling<br>we're always having to make assumptions<br>so we need all of these techniques for<br>us to understand what's going<br>on so why why are we interested in fluid<br>dynamics well I'm interested in it<br>because it's all about aerodynamics and<br>faster cars of<br>course but there's lots of other fluids<br>as well it's not just air Could Be Blood<br>could be oil it could be water it could<br>be honey syrup you know if you're in the<br>food industry so and it's used in a lot<br>of places<br>now and the next few slides are just<br>some examples from work I've done or<br>students that I've worked with have done<br>so this first slide is some commercial<br>applications of fluid dynamics on the<br>left hand side top and bottom pictures<br>are some work a student um did for fish<br>on P did a PhD with fish on P looking at<br>the cooling circuit in a um a<br>self-cleaning oven try and cool the door<br>and trying to match up visualization and<br>uh computational flow Dynamics results<br>and then on the right work that I've<br>done with a local company you might know<br>them Powerhouse wind and they designed<br>the this Innovative one blade wind<br>turbines in fact if you've not seen one<br>in motion walk down to the PO Technic I<br>think it's Block H there's one on there<br>so on a windy day have a walk down and<br>have a look at it going around<br>it's quite a sight to be seen and we've<br>worked with Bill at pous wind looking at<br>how their blade Works how we can improve<br>efficiency and<br>Effectiveness um you know get more power<br>do better things with<br>it we might also be interested in safety<br>and<br>performance so a few examples here so<br>these were um these two pictures of jet<br>sorry they're a bit fuzzy um are work<br>that we I did with a PhD student in<br>hartfordshire it was actually all<br>experimental work looking at gas jets<br>very high press gas jets coming out of a<br>gasket and this actually was a direct<br>result um of how they think the piper<br>Alpha disaster happened that a metal<br>gasket that was um helping Seal two<br>pipes join together blue and this High<br>Press jet of hydrocarbons came out when<br>they mixed with the air they got to a<br>point where they were flammable they hit<br>a hot object or an hot surface and then<br>the fire started so what we were<br>interested here was what that break in<br>the gasket looks like and how it affects<br>what the jet looks like and we can see<br>these lovely pictures and they're done<br>with a a laser and a laser sheet and a<br>high powerered camera we can see these<br>lovely entraining of the air into the<br>jet into the in this case it's not<br>hydrocarbon It's actually an air jet<br>that's actually seeded with a drain bomb<br>just cuz that was the best thing um and<br>we can see how the air is in trailing<br>and the Jet is expanding and so it gives<br>us an understanding of how that<br>mechanism of of fire might have<br>happened and on the right we see just<br>some work we did<br>on or I did on um a motorbike helmet<br>just looking at if we had ventilation<br>holes in there how it affects<br>aerodynamic performance and some work a<br>student did um in conjunction with Ross<br>venel and Marine Science on looking at<br>sort of swimming and he had some data<br>that he' uh experimental data he taken<br>in The Flume in fed a very long time<br>ago but also we might actually be<br>interested in how fluids work in our<br>body we can't function without fluids<br>we've got blood and air you know that<br>Keep Us Alive and this was some work<br>that an honor student did a couple of<br>years ago looking at the stresses on the<br>walls I think it was an of an aorta um<br>with sort of pulses blood flowing<br>through it trying to match that up with<br>data and finally just some examples of<br>again some different fluids and this is<br>what I call this is work that I call<br>exploring the design space so this isn't<br>something that's existing necessarily<br>this is something that we want to use uh<br>our fluid dynamics techniques whether<br>it's experimental or computational to<br>try and understand what might happen and<br>can we actually use that to design a<br>better product or um a better outcome so<br>in the top left this is very recent work<br>with the project we've been doing with<br>plant and food on corthorn on designing<br>an open ocean aquaculture structure for<br>finfish and so the pictures you see here<br>the colors indicate dissolved oxygen<br>concentration and let me just look at it<br>here um blue is good red is bad red that<br>sort of red the ready colors of the kill<br>zones that's where the fish won't<br>survive in this structure and the blues<br>and the greens are where the fish will<br>survive and we were just trying out some<br>different designs actually of the<br>material on the sides of this open ocean<br>um structure and what this work was<br>doing was try helping sort of almost to<br>Biff out the bad designs so that we<br>could concentrate on you know what what<br>was good the picture underneath that is<br>some work I did a few years ago looking<br>at pumps in houses so looking at how we<br>heat our houses um and looking at the<br>position of the heat pumps looking at<br>how fast the the air the heated air<br>coming out of the heat pumps is and what<br>direction it was aimed at and how long<br>the heat pump was on and how effectively<br>that would heat a room and the rest of<br>the house and as we see you know the red<br>areas where the heat pump was and we can<br>see in this instance it wasn't doing a<br>very good job of heating anything beyond<br>that room so that's about you know<br>exploring maybe different places we can<br>put the heat pumps<br>Etc um I did some work this is probably<br>one of the most um yeah exciting maybe<br>um in the UK with an effluent company or<br>a company that dealt with Wastewater<br>they had a biob bead system you know<br>basically the eant came in and it went<br>through a series of biob beads and came<br>out and all the horrible stuff stuck to<br>the biob beads and then you got you know<br>better water out of the end and they<br>wanted to look at their design and see<br>if they could design something that was<br>more<br>effective and the bottom picture was<br>some work we did on some snow fences<br>that had been put up um in some of the<br>mountains Southern Alps um to direct<br>snow onto plants or snow away from<br>plants to see how effective that was<br>helping the plants grow so hopefully<br>from these examples you can see that<br>understanding fluids is really there's<br>lots of different applications and quite<br>fundamental things that we want to know<br>and of of course you know any of you<br>interested in the weather that's all<br>about fluids as<br>well right now I apologize I felt I had<br>to put some equations in so I got to go<br>through them really quickly so these are<br>the equations that um explain or or<br>govern um how fluids flow or fluid<br>dynamics basically it comes down to the<br>conservation of mass that principle that<br>we can't create or destroy mass in a<br>system and conservation of momentum all<br>for Newton's Second Law F force is equal<br>to masstimes<br>acceleration and that's really where<br>these come from I'm not going to explain<br>them any more than that except to<br>explain that these are vector equations<br>so this might look like two equations to<br>you but it's actually Four because<br>directions sorry there is three pages of<br>this but I'm going fast I'm going fast I<br>our equations of conservation uh<br>conservation of momentum are actually<br>known in FL Dynamics really as the navio<br>Stokes equations and the reason for that<br>is is that the viscus stress tensor<br>which appeared if you were paying<br>attention in the second equation on the<br>First on that previous slide um and it's<br>a way of describing this viscous stress<br>tensor in terms of velocity and<br>pressure um which makes things slightly<br>easier for us trust me it<br>does so we've now got got some equations<br>we've got four<br>unknowns we've got four equations we<br>should be able to solve them surely well<br>they're quite complex they're nonlinear<br>they're second<br>order no sorry except in very simple<br>cases that's not possible and we have an<br>additional complication so we can yes we<br>can put them in we can solve them<br>hopefully computationally but that<br>requires sometimes a lot of computing<br>power so we have to bring in further<br>models and turbulence is one of those<br>things that we often have to model so<br>turbulence is when we have a higher flow<br>rate or a less viscous fluid and it's<br>when we get that sort of more chaotic<br>structure remember back to those jets<br>that I showed you that's turbulent flow<br>those sort of chaotic or they look<br>chaotic<br>structures and so we have to model those<br>so one of the ways and certainly as an<br>engineer trying to do these practical<br>problems that we do this is we introduce<br>some transport equations for turbulent<br>kinetic energy K and turbulent kinetic<br>dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy<br>Epsilon so now we've got six equations<br>and six unknowns so we've made life of<br>what seems like a bit more complicated<br>for ourselves but luckily luckily we<br>have people who've already done this oh<br>sorry there we go so I use a commercial<br>code that when<br>a lot of that hard work has been done<br>for us all those equations have been put<br>into a form that allows the computers<br>these equations to be solved or<br>approximated so how do we do that<br>well we have to create our<br>geometry so what is the thing that we<br>want the fluid to flow over or flow<br>through we then have to divide that up<br>into lots and lots of different uh small<br>volumes or meshing it and so I'll give<br>you an example a Formula 1 car<br>apparently I've heard that the Red Bull<br>Formula 1 car when they're solving that<br>using cfd they have a mesh of 9 billion<br>cells okay they use a massive computer<br>cluster to do that I can do I think on<br>my current computer probably about 70 to<br>80 million<br>cells so we need computing<br>power we have to Define our fluid<br>properties that tells us how the fluid<br>behaves things like the density the<br>viscosity how sticky the fluid is how<br>much it resists<br>movement and maybe other things as well<br>maybe the properties change when we<br>change temperature or we change the<br>force that we apply to<br>it we set our boundary conditions so<br>what's going on on maybe the surfaces<br>that it's flowing over what's going on<br>where is the flow coming in where's the<br>flow going out all those things we have<br>to think about<br>we have to set initial conditions that's<br>just a numeric thing we have to choose<br>our models our models for turbulence but<br>we might have heat involved we might<br>have a two-phase flow so we might have<br>water bubbles in air we might have air<br>bubbles in water we might have sand in<br>air and we might want to simulate those<br>things that makes life a bit more<br>us oh going the wrong way<br>sorry and then we solve these so let's<br>take it if I've got I've got six<br>equations and I've got a mesh that's a<br>million got a million cells in it then<br>I'm going to be solving 6 million<br>equations multiple times I might be<br>doing that 500 to A Thousand Times until<br>I reach a point where I'm satisfied my<br>error is small enough that I've got a<br>converged solution so we can see why<br>important I then post we then<br>postprocess those so that we can get<br>those nice pictures out we can get the<br>data out and understand what's going<br>on and this is I think in some ways one<br>of the most important steps we then have<br>to validate that we have to understand<br>what's going on and so we do that we<br>might do it against an analytical model<br>if we have one we might do it against<br>field data that we've gone out and<br>gathered we might do it against wind<br>tunnel data or experimental lab data and<br>most of the time doesn't quite match up<br>we've probably not got it right the<br>first time so we have to go back we<br>might have to look at our geometry and<br>say have we made things too complicated<br>or have we made things too simple what<br>have I missed out what do I need to<br>include we might have to look at the<br>boundary conditions we've set have we<br>have we modeled everything that's<br>or we might want to look at some of the<br>models we've used we may be not using<br>the correct turbulence model um and it's<br>not you know giving us good enough<br>answers so that's a very brief sort of<br>overview very hand wavy of fluid<br>dynamics I'm now going to give you some<br>examples of use yeah I still got time um<br>um and I'm going to do it in the context<br>of flows over Coastal June systems just<br>because um you know it's something that<br>I've been doing for many years and I<br>think there's lots of really great<br>examples to come out of that so one of<br>the reasons Junes are so interesting and<br>they're so interesting in terms of fluid<br>dynamics is that there's all this<br>complexity to them they come in really<br>loads of different shapes and<br>sizes there's things like moving<br>sand there's vegetation on<br>them we get variable wind speeds and<br>directions anybody who goes for a walk<br>on the beach will know you know you're<br>either in a gale and it's you know one<br>way and or it's it can be very Gusty you<br>know it can be blowing from One<br>Direction at one speed and then<br>change the morphology can be very<br>Dynamic depending on where you are you<br>can go what there one day the next day<br>there might have been a big event and<br>you know you know you've got things<br>exposed or you've got scarping and they<br>can be really large scale structures<br>this picture in the bottom left is of<br>Mason Bay a few years ago and we can see<br>these are Big parabolic jeunes behind<br>the for<br>JE so lots of complexity lots of things<br>that we have to<br>consider so I'm going to go all the way<br>back to my PhD this was when I first<br>started looking at pH at Sunan Junes now<br>it's sort of quite an interesting topic<br>for me I'm redhead I don't like the very<br>much I burn Sands a bit you know gets<br>between your toes it's a bit like you<br>know but there was something about this<br>topic that really excited me and I did a<br>a completely theoretical study I didn't<br>actually it was actually around uh<br>desert Junes so no vegetation so we<br>simplified things but also Junes and<br>ripples under the water as well you know<br>you may have noticed that if you go<br>paddling or something you can sometimes<br>see ripples on the sandbed underwater as<br>well<br>and basically I looked at how sandunes<br>develop you know do they develop the<br>they usually develop from an instability<br>and then you know what are the<br>conditions in which they'll continue to<br>develop or will they just sort of Fade<br>Away um but also looked at sediment<br>Transportation so hopefully my little<br>video this is a very bad quality video<br>because it's from a long time ago but<br>hopefully you can see that actually it's<br>not the quality of the video those are<br>actually sort of sandstream so you can<br>see the the sand moving if anyone's been<br>on a beach when it is blowing really<br>strongly sometimes you can be within a<br>sort of saltation layer and that's where<br>the wind is picking the sand up and it's<br>sort of bouncing it's hopping and it<br>creates this sort of layer it can be you<br>know sometimes up to about a meter your<br>waist height high and that's what's<br>happening and so my PhD work was this<br>two layer boundary layer um sort of<br>analysis and try to put some Theory and<br>um theoretical sort of boundaries on<br>what's happening with that saltation and<br>bed<br>perturbation so let's come more<br>towards what we're doing now so some of<br>the methods we use and they go hand<br>inand I can't just do my computational<br>work without do my colleagues in<br>geography and other places who do the<br>field work<br>that it's really key that we do both of<br>those things or all of those things so<br>in the field workor we use anemometers<br>as a picture here um the second from the<br>left um to measure the wind speed and<br>direction obviously we can only put them<br>in certain places often these are quite<br>tall these are sometimes 2 to 5 m High<br>these masks they're you know in quite<br>unpleasant conditions we might put out<br>sand traps to measure how much sand is<br>moving<br>we might do vegetation survey so we<br>understand what the vegetation is on the<br>June systems in terms of the modeling we<br>can use two and threedimensional<br>models we can use real and so we've got<br>an example here on the left um again<br>this is Mason Bay parabolic 6 so we use<br>sort of things like liar data and read<br>that into our our CAD system and create<br>these um surfaces or we can use very<br>idealized or much more idealized<br>geometry we've got an example here um in<br>the<br>middle we can also and I'll show an<br>example if I've got time of um our use<br>of machine learning as well and we've<br>done I've done some work on vegetation<br>models and we do this for a variety of<br>reasons model creation like our<br>vegetation model<br>um understanding and troubleshooting why<br>something might have happened uh<br>prediction you know we might want to<br>know if a certain intervention<br>might actually be helpful to protect the<br>things that are behind the sand Jun for<br>example and of course to uh improve our<br>conceptual understanding of what the<br>genes are<br>doing so this is why I like doing<br>modeling this is why I don't want to do<br>a lot of field work but unfortunately I<br>do have to get out in the field and it<br>is really important for modelers to get<br>out in the field but you know you pick<br>and choose your times this is so thanks<br>to Mike Hilton this was his picture and<br>one of those is not me I definitely was<br>not there then but you can see this is<br>the challenging environment that we're<br>working in and our jeans are in and that<br>we sometimes have to be gathering our<br>data in and we can see why modeling can<br>be a really helpful tool um to help you<br>know understand and fill some of those<br>gaps in because we're not Gathering a<br>that so this is one of the<br>this is my most highly cited paper and<br>I'm not saying that to boast but I'm<br>saying that it's because at the time<br>2010 to you know<br>2009 not a lot of people were using<br>computational flow Dynamics modeling in<br>the June you know flow over Junes and if<br>they were it was really idealized uh<br>Landscapes and so this paper it was just<br>a two-dimensional it was a um a line<br>through from Beach to the end of<br>parabolic 6 and we did some modeling and<br>we tried out a few things different<br>roughnesses on the surface um different<br>sizes of our domain remember this was<br>you know quite a few years ago 14 years<br>ago so our computer capacity was much<br>less we had to make some calls on what<br>we were doing but this really sort of<br>set a lot of the parameters for um<br>modeling that's done by ourselves and<br>others today so I'm very proud of this<br>work because it took a a lot to get it<br>out there and yeah lots of people are<br>using<br>it back to some more recent work those<br>of you who maybe has taken a walk in the<br>last few years on St kilder Beach might<br>have noticed that there's been some<br>notches cut in the for June if you<br>haven't noticed go and have a look I<br>think there some of them are still there<br>so my PhD student duck who I<br>co-supervised with Mike Hilton um did a<br>lot of work looking at these notches and<br>these notches were put in um by the<br>council as a way to um protect what was<br>going on behind the for June um you know<br>where it meets John Wilson Drive that<br>great big immovable object that is John<br>Wilson Drive and to try and take some of<br>the energy momentum and sand that was<br>coming from the beach and these high<br>energy events these storms um and bring<br>it through to the back June and just try<br>and um protect that system a little bit<br>more and to experiment and see what<br>happened so these notches were cut at<br>different angles and different depths<br>and um duck did a lot of work both<br>computationally and in the field to<br>understand what was going on and<br>published quite a few papers these are<br>some of the methods that he used speed<br>up um I'm going to skip over actually<br>probably a couple of these slides but<br>please come and see me if you're<br>interested but what he was able to do he<br>um a really nice conceptual thinker was<br>come up with some of these nice<br>conceptual ideas um for example example<br>when the notch is active in terms of<br>wind direction um and wind velocity wind<br>speed and match up so did things like<br>look at elevation did surveys and look<br>at where the Dune after events was were<br>building up or eroding and matching<br>those with wind flow that we got through<br>our the computational modeling and<br>really starting to understand how the<br>wind flows through these Notches at<br>different directions and speeds and<br>again<br>really useful tools for Coastal managers<br>to um try and understand what's going on<br>and maybe think about what they might do<br>in the<br>future because these things are<br>expensive to cut we don't want to cut<br>one and make a mistake and destroy the<br>ecology behind the June system and all<br>that uh and again another example of<br>just looking at the flow behind uh the<br>for June between the for June and John<br>another thing that we did was actually<br>look and this was purely<br>computational uh this was in the<br>prediction realm so this was what<br>happens if we had the capacity to change<br>the distance between the for June and<br>John Wilson Drive what would happen if<br>we change the angle that that June came<br>down from John Wilson Drive would it<br>improve the flow how would it change the<br>flow<br>and you know does that help us<br>understand what's going to to<br>happen and again help Co help Coastal<br>managers understand ways in which they<br>can help protect the June and what's<br>behind it so I like this idea of this<br>predictive ability but we were only able<br>to do this paper and this predictions<br>because we'd done all the other ones and<br>we'd really established that our<br>computational flow Dynamics really<br>matched up well with the field data that<br>we were measuring and that confidence it<br>gave us confidence to be able to do this<br>work so I change tax a little bit but it<br>does lead into it and this is some work<br>that I did with Michael mayup at weat<br>and Bernie bow at University of British<br>Columbia um and this was using could we<br>use machine learning to help us predict<br>where flow structures might occur on a<br>June system and I mean the short answer<br>is yes we could it it worked we did we<br>had five parameters that we were<br>changing three June to do with the<br>height and the crest and the slopes and<br>uh two to do with the wind the wind<br>speed the wind<br>direction and if we took all<br>permutations of all of those I think it<br>would have been 450 OD simulations<br>considering each one took me about two<br>or three days to do I did not want to do<br>450 simulations and then I would have<br>been left with this huge amount of<br>information and data that I would not<br>know have known how to<br>analyze in the end we did a 100<br>simulations for the machine learning<br>training and testing and matched them up<br>and what we found was we could if we<br>picked our targets correctly we could<br>use machine learning to predict that<br>flow structures would appear or wouldn't<br>appear which of our variables were<br>significant in those flow structures<br>being there and we actually did another<br>experiment to actually we could actually<br>predict whether those flow structures<br>would appear at the the toe of the June<br>at the front or at the back of the June<br>so that was really a nice bit of work<br>that really helped us understand and<br>build conceptual<br>understanding I've also done work this<br>is the my most recent and it's not<br>published most recent work which is<br>looking at vegetation on Junes when the<br>wind blows you might have seen the maram<br>grass that sort of tall stuff that grows<br>on a lot of New Zealand Junes bends<br>over can we actually model so so the<br>roughness the how smooth the the surface<br>is or how rough the surface is then<br>changes with how strong the wind<br>is in short we've built a dynamic<br>roughness model it's it's a bit initial<br>at the moment we we had to rely on field<br>data to build our model and of course<br>the wind never blows at the right speed<br>or at the right time you know you've<br>either left your instruments on and it<br>doesn't blow or you've turned your<br>instruments off for the night to save<br>the batteries and you get a really good<br>event coming through but but we got<br>enough data to enable us to build a<br>model that as the wind changed change<br>wind speed changes the roughness on the<br>surface<br>changes and just a few results and this<br>is just going from Beach to the back of<br>the June and these are some different<br>models but what we need to look at is<br>the difference I suppose between the<br>constant as a constant roughness and our<br>Dynamic roughness at the beach it<br>doesn't make any difference what we have<br>going on on the June<br>as we move to the STS toe the beginning<br>of the June it still doesn't make that<br>much difference slight difference on the<br>STS slope but not<br>much get to the crest of the June<br>suddenly we start seeing at the speed up<br>this sort of classic um nose in our wind<br>profile that the roughness does make a<br>difference and it makes a difference up<br>to about a meter above the June surface<br>so actually what roughness and what<br>roughness model we use is really<br>important and we can see that that<br>difference as we get into the Lee we get<br>recirculation the differences become<br>much<br>more skip through these because I think<br>I'm running out of<br>time we've also done a bit of work um<br>looking at the instruments that we<br>measure with and this was an instrument<br>that Mike designed with our old design<br>studies technician bill um and we did<br>some cfd just to check how it was<br>working and that it was being effective<br>and<br>efficient okay I'm almost at the end so<br>so that's my Jean stuff there's lots of<br>other stuff as Rich has sort of<br>intimated I'm a bit of a I get a bit<br>bored I like to do different things but<br>one of the joys in my life has been<br>teaching the sustainability paper with<br>Linda um but not only the teaching of it<br>but actually we've managed to sort of<br>publish an article about it which has<br>been fantastic and we're in the process<br>of um you know writing another couple of<br>articles but also I've done some other<br>uh papers and and research in the<br>teaching space to do with design as well<br>so I just wanted to do a sort of special<br>mention and and show the picture of me<br>and Linda by The Bins which is always<br>funny um now that doesn't mean that I'm<br>not you know I've I've worked with lots<br>of fantastic dep departments and other<br>people and um you know I haven't been<br>able to mention the stuff we've done<br>with Lisa O'Neal on fashion<br>sustainability um the energy stuff I've<br>done you know uh the stuff I've done<br>with Wayne in the school of geography um<br>to do with waves and Rocky Coast has all<br>been fantastic but I suppose my biggest<br>thanks here is to the Department of<br>maths and stats you've been fantastic I<br>was a refugee I think I would call<br>myself and you really took me to your<br>hearts and you let me be your head of<br>department and that's a real privilege<br>so thank you very much so final couple<br>of<br>slides why am I holding a Formula One<br>car well I think we've established that<br>I love cars I love racing it's actually<br>a McLaren and I have to say thank you<br>very much to to Charlotte ball Richard's<br>EA for Lending me the model it's a Lego<br>model it's not<br>mine is very appropriate as a McLaren as<br>some of you may know Bruce McLaren was a<br>New Zealander he was a very influential<br>person in Formula 1 in the sort of 60s<br>and 70s he was unfortunately killed in<br>1970 um but the other significant thing<br>is the McLaren Factory where they build<br>and they design these cars is in woking<br>which is where I was born so I think<br>that's a really nice<br>story so I've been blown around I was<br>been blown around from the UK to New<br>Zealand I've been blown around the<br>university but I think I've landed<br>really well in math and studs<br>so couple more I promise you I'm almost<br>finished I just wanted to talk about<br>some of the people who inspired me this<br>is my mom and dad um I think yeah they<br>they never judged I didn't get into my<br>first University I didn't want to take<br>the Oxbridge exam and they were very<br>understanding I think they were just<br>thrilled that I went to<br>University my granny my granny wakes she<br>taught me that it's never you're never<br>too old to learn something new she<br>taught herself how to watercolor paint<br>at 82 and took her first flight to<br>Australia at the age of 80 to visit her<br>daughter I think that's pretty<br>cool my grandpa grandpa Murray my mom's<br>dad he was a master<br>Carpenter little education but a<br>fantastic FC person and love to read and<br>I think I really got some of I didn't<br>get the uh you know ability to make nice<br>things but I got the ability to love how<br>to<br>read honor Eric Holder he was my boss at<br>hartfordshire he was a fantastic boss he<br>taught me how to be a good boss he gave<br>me so many opportunities and really<br>pushed me and it's because of him that<br>I'm sort of an engineer and I'm here now<br>and the other person who pushed me is<br>Chris Shaw he was the person who<br>interviewed me um and brought me here<br>and he really pushed me in New Zealand<br>to join engineering New Zealand and to<br>apply to be a fellow so thank you Chris<br>and the final one you're not done with<br>Formula 1 yet is leis Hamilton he is my<br>favorite driver but that's not why he's<br>inspiring to me this picture says it all<br>really this is during during the co<br>years and this was during the black<br>lives matter and I think his T-shirt<br>black lives matter women's rights are<br>human rights<br>immigration is a good thing science is<br>Real Love Is Love that's really inspired<br>me to push and Champion inclusivity<br>diversity and<br>Equity oh big thank you to all my<br>friends and family especially Nick and<br>of course the most important person in<br>our household James who is the cat in<br>the middle you can see him helping me<br>there with my iPad um but lots of people<br>I haven't included everyone on this<br>slide um but but yeah thank you very<br>much and finally I promise you this is<br>the last slide I was told I couldn't<br>include any music in the presentation<br>and I understand why but music's a<br>really big part of me and I think it's a<br>really big part of understanding a<br>person so everyone get their phones out<br>if you're interested this is a Spotify<br>playlist and there's a gold star to<br>anybody who can come up and tell me<br>which of the bands on that playlist I<br>saw on the night of my PhD or<br>much<br>humiliate so hello my name's uh David<br>Bryant I'm a professor in the Department<br>of Mathematics and statistics and I have<br>three jobs to do right now and the first<br>and probably the most important is to<br>thank Sarah for that wonderful talk um<br>she said she was nervous earlier but I<br>didn't really see it too much unless you<br>really look closely but it was a talk<br>full of um wonderful stories really<br>interesting problems really interesting<br>maths problems uh really interesting<br>ideas and uh genuine<br>contributions<br>um and I'll say also why I particular<br>particularly liked the talk and and may<br>maybe this is a a a little bit of a a<br>sort of Applied meth culture thing and<br>that if you look at uh like first year<br>textbooks or something like that and<br>they're often full of lots of little<br>problems from all all different areas of<br>Science and Math and and everything and<br>and that's good because there's a chance<br>that you know a student reading it will<br>will hook onto it and you know you get<br>the idea that what you're doing is<br>useful but it gives particularly gives<br>um J is the idea that um what applied<br>mathemat mathematicians do is is they<br>wait and then they get these problems<br>which are like fully formed and and<br>fully digested and it's like when your<br>parents sort of cut up food for a baby<br>and they Pro you know and they give it<br>to you right what you have to appreciate<br>in is it in the sort of research career<br>of um<br>Sarah and um you know a huge part of her<br>contribution has to be go out and and<br>find those messy problems and turn them<br>into things that we can actually do<br>stuff with and that's a whole range of<br>skills I mean we see we see technical<br>skills and and ability to put fancy<br>equations up that's that's sort of one<br>small part of it the ability to drive<br>computers who don't want to be driven is<br>another part of it but it's also the<br>ability to go um and work in like<br>different cultures or different research<br>cultures different scientific cultures<br>to be able to go and like learn learn<br>the language learn the literature to be<br>able to go into a pub and argue even if<br>it's not in in your discipline okay<br>because that's all part of of of<br>formulating you know your research and<br>and pulling it together and I think<br>that's probably one of um Sarah's<br>strengths and this ability to sort of go<br>to different cultures you know even if<br>they've been away for a long time is I<br>think also perhaps something that has um<br>served her extremely well as uh a a head<br>of Department in in mathematics and<br>statistics um and we are extremely<br>grateful her for her<br>contribution um<br>there so my second job is to thank all<br>of you for coming to this uh um coming<br>to this IPL um I trust you've enjoyed it<br>as much as I have um and my third job is<br>to inform you that you are invited to<br>the staff Club where you'll have the<br>opportunity to buy Sarah a<br>drink okay thank you very<br>much this just reminded me of probably<br>the most important
