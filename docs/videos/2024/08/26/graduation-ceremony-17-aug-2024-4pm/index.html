deliver the graduation<br>Chancellor pro-chancellor Vice<br>Chancellor council members academics<br>graduates FAL guests<br>friends it is a huge honor to be asked<br>to address you all on your special day<br>so first and foremost congratulations<br>graduates on completing your<br>degree it is a very old tradition to<br>wheel out a very old person on these<br>occasions to inspire the assembled<br>throng and it is quite confronting to<br>realize that I am now well and truly<br>that old person and the pressure is on<br>to imparts and<br>wisdom I still remember my own<br>graduation ceremony well and you might<br>hope that on these auspicious occasions<br>having graduated from A Fine University<br>at the other side of the world I could<br>draw on those words of wisdom that were<br>imparted to me in my youth and build on<br>them<br>now sadly<br>no I I don't remember a single<br>word for a start it was all in<br>Latin but happily the internet has let<br>me listen in English to many speeches<br>some some of which resonated with my own<br>experiences and for the record my<br>favorite ones full of wit and wisdom<br>were those I heard from Tim Minon in<br>Perth and Dame Helen mirin in New<br>Orleans and I thank them for the parts<br>that I have<br>borrowed you should be incredibly proud<br>of yourselves for finishing your degree<br>it will have been easy for some of you<br>and a struggle for others but that<br>really doesn't matter now you did it go<br>you you're embarking on the next next<br>step in which in what we all hope are<br>glittering careers a time of great<br>excitement and some trepidation perhaps<br>a time of major life decisions too<br>whether to set out on a life of<br>Independence or together with the person<br>you love to have children or not to<br>travel or settle a time of deciding what<br>you believe in and how you want to spend<br>your<br>days this is for many of you the most<br>free you will ever be to choose the sort<br>of life you want to live which is<br>exhilarating and also perhaps a little<br>scary so here is my list of 10 Things I<br>really wish someone had told me when I<br>was standing in your shoes these are the<br>things I've learned that turn out to be<br>far more useful than anything I actually<br>studied my hope is that at least one of<br>them turns out to be useful to you one<br>day<br>number one care about what's<br>true always tell the truth and seek the<br>truth pursue a constant Restless search<br>for knowledge this has never been more<br>important be skeptical especially before<br>you share information that might not be<br>true challenge<br>opinions especially challenge your own<br>opinion have you got it right to borrow<br>a very cheeky pearl of wisdom from Tim<br>mention opinions are like in<br>one but opinions differ significantly<br>from in that yours should be<br>examined which is to<br>say understand your own biases and<br>prejudices debate don't argue find<br>common ground<br>we live in a time where rational thought<br>itself is under threat where the very<br>concept of a fact is contested a world<br>where science no longer holds the<br>privilege it once held attacked by those<br>who reject its findings and prefer their<br>own<br>beliefs as a community of experts we<br>need to hold ourselves to the very<br>highest standards in presenting evidence<br>in an unbiased way and find ways to<br>respectfully debate the issues with<br>those who do not respect our evidence<br>this is not just a useful tip it's<br>science's greatest challenge for the<br>21st<br>century number two do what your heart<br>tells you to do not what others tell you<br>to<br>do JK Rowling's mother told her not to<br>be a<br>writer lots of people will tell you<br>what's sensible how much money you could<br>earn who you should vote for whether<br>when and who you should marry and listen<br>especially to the people who know know<br>you well but then do what feels right<br>for you don't squeeze yourself into a<br>role to make someone else happy because<br>if you don't fit the role you will at<br>best<br>disappoint don't chase money chase Your<br>Passion most fortunes are built on<br>passion not greed anyway do things<br>because you believe they are worth doing<br>or because they are fun and you will<br>succeed take responsibility for your own<br>happiness take that risk don't spend<br>your life wondering what would have<br>number three thank your<br>parents blaming your parents has an<br>expiry<br>date yes they might be really annoying<br>but you know what they've tried their<br>very best and done as well as they can<br>for you and if and when you're a parent<br>yourself you may suddenly understand<br>this by then though it might be too late<br>to tell them so let's thank them now<br>give your farno a round of applause<br>it's okay to change your mind number<br>four dreams and goals are great but if<br>you find out they don't make you happy<br>change them I'm glad I didn't carry on<br>with my time at Sea on a prawn troller<br>I'm glad I changed my mind about being<br>an air hostess a novelist a wife a<br>marketer a fancy cake business owner and<br>a hippie actually I made May yet be a<br>hippie if you do change course though do<br>it positively and be careful with other<br>people's hearts and feelings don't burn<br>your Bridges and make those exits with<br>Grace So at the risk of upsetting those<br>parents we just thanked if some of you<br>are sitting there with this secret<br>nagging doubt you did the wrong degree<br>it's okay you can change course whenever<br>you<br>like number five be positive and be kind<br>Define Yourself by what you you do<br>believe not by what you don't believe be<br>Pro things not anti- things be kind to<br>strangers be kind to people at work be<br>kind to people at home be kind to people<br>on the internet be kind to yourself keep<br>your love letters and throw away your<br>bank<br>statements number six do something that<br>scares you push<br>boundaries some of you will have pushed<br>boundaries to get here today raise your<br>hand if you are the first person in your<br>graduate extra congratulations to you<br>guys you've learned something that the<br>others have not that you can do things<br>that weren't expected of you keep doing<br>it you know better than the others that<br>you don't have to do things the way<br>they've always been<br>done TR trust your<br>instincts generally speaking following<br>instructions is a good idea but if<br>there's a really silly rule at work try<br>breaking<br>it then ask forgiveness not permission<br>Chancellor number seven say yes people<br>will tell you to learn to say no but<br>also learn to say yes seize<br>opportunities with both hands and<br>whatever you agree to do throw energy at<br>it and do it well and do it smiling<br>never think a task is beneath you new<br>doors will open when you say yes<br>enthusiastically and give it your<br>all number eight everyone makes mistakes<br>including you don't pretend they don't<br>be understanding when they do and help<br>fix things own your own mistakes take<br>responsibility say sorry make amends<br>don't blame other s don't waste time<br>agonizing over it move on to quote Dame<br>Helen triumphs and disasters are like<br>hangovers and neither lasts<br>forever number nine call out bullying<br>and Prejudice keeping quiet is not okay<br>say something do something then find a<br>way to move forward don't stay<br>angry number 10 listen last and perhaps<br>the most important I have a hunt that<br>the days of finger wagging pointy head<br>scientists waving graphs at people are<br>numbered as experts we can no longer<br>command Respect by Dent of position or<br>experience we need to earn it we need to<br>build trust to understand the<br>perspectives and World Views of others<br>and to make our own expertise<br>transparent and accessible to<br>them something that I learned the hard<br>way in my personal life is important in<br>the workplace too just because you are<br>very clever and very good at debating<br>does not necessarily mean that you are<br>correct it just means that you're good<br>at winning<br>arguments pause instead and listen to<br>other points of view hear not only the<br>words but the values behind the words<br>find common ground in shared values<br>after all both vaxers and antivaxers<br>want what is best for their children<br>start there earn trust and develop a<br>shared understanding of what is<br>important<br>but before you do all that take a breath<br>and some time to celebrate your<br>fantastic achievements which we<br>recognize in this ceremony today<br>congratulations once again
