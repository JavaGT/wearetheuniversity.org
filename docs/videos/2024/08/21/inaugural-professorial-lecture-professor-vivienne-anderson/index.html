Vice<br>Chancellor academic it's my great<br>pleasure to welcome you to this very<br>special occasion to celebrate the<br>promotion of Professor Vivian Anderson<br>to the role of<br>Professor these lectures are a highlight<br>of my week as I'm sure they are of many<br>of you too they're a wonderful<br>opportunity for us to come together and<br>listen to our new professors talk about<br>their personal Journeys their research<br>platform and the impact of their<br>research on<br>others I'd like to welcome colleagues<br>students and friends from across the<br>university and Beyond including those<br>joining us tonight by live<br>stream I would like to give a special<br>welcome to Vivian's family who are with<br>us in person this<br>evening especially to her husband Greg<br>Anderson to her daughter and son-in-law<br>Lydia and Anton Dunford<br>to her sisters Allison Stedman Janet<br>Gettys and Felicity brigh her brother<br>Rosel Stedman her<br>sister-in-law lur po Stedman her<br>brother-in-law and nephew Tony and Alex<br>Vander<br>weiron I'd also like to welcome those<br>members of her family who are joining us<br>online tonight especially to her father<br>David Stedman and her<br>Sons Lewis Anderson who's joining us<br>tonight online from New York and to<br>Finley Anderson who's joining us uh<br>online from<br>Singapore so welcome<br>all it's not easy to become a professor<br>at the University of atago in order to<br>be promoted to that level candidates<br>need to show that they are outstanding<br>in each of three categories teaching re<br>search and<br>service Professor Anderson has clearly<br>met all three of these<br>criteria it is an honor and a privilege<br>to congratulate her tonight for that<br>outstanding achievement and I hope<br>you'll join me in doing the same right<br>now now I would clap except I've got a<br>microphone in my hand so if I could ask<br>thank you very much and I hope you'll<br>take every opportunity to do more of<br>that this<br>evening Professor Anderson is Dean of<br>the College of Education her research<br>sits at the policy practice interface<br>and has explored questions relating to<br>educational equity and access<br>educational mobility and educational<br>Pathways across a range of educational<br>and geographical contexts her recent<br>research has used multilingual<br>arts-based methods to examine<br>educational barriers and enablers for<br>young people from Refugee backgrounds<br>seeking education in New<br>Zealand tonight Professor Anderson<br>reflects on the promise of Education in<br>contexts of displacement and<br>resettlement and on the structural<br>personal and interpersonal factors that<br>shape and constrain educational access<br>she'll also tell us a little bit about<br>her own personal journey and about the<br>impact of her resarch on the profession<br>on her teaching and most importantly<br>honor her students but before she does<br>that I'll hand over to Professor Karen<br>Nar naron from the College of Education<br>to formally introduce Professor Anderson<br>and give you a little more detail about<br>what a pleasure it is to introduce you<br>to introduce Professor Vivian Anderson<br>it sounds very<br>good and who would have thought um when<br>in<br>1987 and teaching you geography that I<br>would be the one to introduce you as<br>full professor in<br>2024 three decades later this is<br>fabulous like it is one of the the<br>dreams come<br>true I love the synchronicities of life<br>and how our paths have continued to<br>crisscross for those of you who don't<br>know I had the pleasure of supervising<br>viv's PhD which explored woman's experi<br>expences in internationalized higher<br>education in Alo completed in<br>2008 and that was co-supervised with<br>Jackie Ley um who and and I'm saying um<br>Jackie in terms of her anthropology<br>background because one of your<br>commitments Viv is to cross disciplinary<br>research and that was evident right from<br>the start in terms of also a commitment<br>to make positive<br>change so so her PhD was about breaking<br>down barriers between International and<br>local students and she created an<br>Innovative group called women across<br>cultures to explore how this um could<br>work demonstrating that commitment to<br>change but also to kind of researching<br>change to make sure it doesn't um turn<br>out to have unintended<br>consequences since then we've<br>co-authored and co-supervised and now<br>you're my Dean and my boss and here I am<br>um ucing you on the occasion of your<br>inaugural professorial<br>lecture and I know that some of you will<br>be aware that um Viv began her career in<br>education as a primary school teacher<br>during the 1990s and early 2000s and<br>Christ Church and following a stint in<br>the USA with her partner Greg um as a<br>new mother and categorized by US<br>immigration as a secondary alien now<br>that's that's quite a category she<br>became interested in<br>internationalization policy and in<br>particular the intersections between<br>policy education and women's lives her<br>PhD was the perfect opportunity to<br>research these intersections and I was<br>delighted to be one of the<br>supervisors V has worked in a range of<br>academic roles here at the University of<br>ATO including as an educational<br>researcher at the faculty of Dentistry<br>then Senior lecturer and academic um and<br>Senior lecturer at the College of<br>Education so she was already with us for<br>an earlier point in time and then went<br>to um higher education development<br>center in 2020 she returned to the<br>College of Education as associate Dean<br>and was appointed as our Dean in<br>2022 she teaches across initial teacher<br>education and education studies programs<br>and is doing an outstanding job as Dean<br>in my humble<br>opinion especially in amongst all of the<br>political changes coming thick and fast<br>from the current coalition government<br>and I'm looking forward to um your<br>presentation tonight because you're<br>going to show us why education matters<br>so over to<br>davidman<br>so and a very very warm welcome to you<br>all um I have to stick to my script not<br>to let briy on a different pathway um so<br>sorry thank you so much for coming it's<br>really overwhelming and humbling seeing<br>you here and um yeah just amazing seeing<br>you here and thank you so much to those<br>who are joining remotely as well<br>um it's just lovely seeing so many<br>people who've been part of my life and<br>my Champions and my mentors and my<br>friends and colleagues and kids awesome<br>so thank<br>you just organize myself here so I want<br>to seek after learning for the sake of<br>your Collective well-being um I don't<br>want to conflate M to and formal<br>education tonight but I love this faki<br>because it acknowledges the impact of<br>learning or knowledge and knowledge<br>sharing on people's Collective<br>well-being not just the well-being of<br>the individual and this is really<br>different from a view of Education or<br>knowledge sharing is simply a matter of<br>skill acquisition or something that can<br>be bought and sold so many colleagues<br>have reminded me in the leadup to this<br>lecture that an IPL is supposed to be a<br>celebration but it's felt like a really<br>heavy task preparing um and this is<br>because there's so much to be worried<br>about and education at present both<br>locally and globally so I'm going to<br>give a<br>rundown bear with me in altero we're<br>facing the introduction of laws that<br>threaten to undermine public<br>education um and to roll back recent<br>progress aimed at addressing<br>longstanding inequities at the same time<br>the recently released uh report on the<br>Royal Commission of inquiry into abuse<br>and care has brought into sharp relief<br>once again how our education system has<br>been deeply implicated in legacies of<br>harm particularly for Mai globally and<br>locally we're seeing a narrowing of<br>curricula in the deprofessionalization<br>of teachers as governments and so-called<br>democracies increasingly dictate the<br>kinds of knowledge that children and<br>young people can have access to and how<br>it can be taught and uh globally we're<br>seeing unprecedented levels of human<br>displacement and are disrupting<br>educational access for millions of<br>people and this matters because<br>education is critical to the development<br>and maintenance of stable functioning<br>societies Healthcare and legal systems<br>and to the possibility of rebuilding<br>after<br>conflict so given all of this I want to<br>acknowledge my own privilege standing<br>here today as someone for whom education<br>has worked um coupled with support from<br>a family who understood our education<br>system and also participated in it so<br>I'm really aware that I'm in a very<br>privileged position being here<br>today so um this lecture is in three<br>parts and I'm going to start just by<br>thanking some really important people<br>who've been very fundamental to my own<br>personal education Journey um before<br>sharing some Snippets from that journey<br>and it'll repeat some of what Karen's<br>already alluded to um then I'll talk in<br>a little bit more depth about my more<br>recent<br>research so this is my mom and dad David<br>and Jean steedman um dad was in four<br>three of my siblings um so dad was a<br>secondary teacher and he's unable to be<br>here tonight but I'm hoping he's<br>watching online with Frank's help killed<br>our dad um my mom was an Oto physio<br>School alumni and flatted on Castle<br>Street so she was a true scarfy um but<br>sadly we lost her to cancer when she was<br>only 37 and I was 10 so these two were<br>my first teachers and I loved hanging<br>out in um dad's science labs but I<br>should have known from the piles of late<br>night marking that um education was<br>probably not a smart lifestyle<br>choice so this is my stepmom Mary and uh<br>she was also a teacher and a great help<br>to me and my friends with senior<br>secondary maths and here she is pushing<br>my two oldest children in her bespoke<br>laundry<br>trolley um sadly we also lost her to<br>cancer far too young so she was just a<br>little bit older than I am now and I owe<br>just a huge debt of gratitude to these<br>three people especially to my dad for<br>his example of kindness strength and<br>faithfulness through some really<br>difficult<br>times so I'd also like to acknowledge<br>Ruth Barton who's here Ruth is Mary's<br>sister and she made the trip down from<br>Oakland tonight to represent the older<br>generation which is just beautiful and<br>Ruth is a retired Professor from an<br>institution but she's always been so<br>encouraging about my foray into Academia<br>coming these are my five siblings Rachel<br>Russell Janet Allison and Felicity<br>pictured here looking fresh at the start<br>of the hum Bridge track along with their<br>partners and some of um my nieces and<br>nephews so all but Rachel managed to<br>come tonight she's dealing with changes<br>in the health space and at a meeting in<br>Oakland just at the<br>moment so these um five have been a real<br>constant in my life and a great source<br>of realism and humor so thank you guys<br>for<br>coming this is my husband Greg on the<br>right and my children Lydia Lewis infin<br>Le um Greg led the way into the world of<br>Academia and he's been my main academic<br>Mentor since I followed him mostly by<br>accident so thank<br>you um and um these three kids have been<br>incredible and I'm just so proud of them<br>they've lived in breathed Academia with<br>us they've survived it and they've gone<br>on their own education Journeys which is<br>beautiful so thank you um for coming<br>Lydia and Anton our bonus son acquired<br>more recently through lyia um and big<br>hugs to leou and Finley they may not<br>they may be in bed I don't know anyway<br>it's<br>recorded So since my focus is on<br>education I'd like to acknowledge two<br>very special teachers um the the one on<br>your left is Mama sington fire mama<br>who's here in the front row which is<br>just amazing so M was my mar teacher at<br>Casmir High School toing oraha in otah<br>back in the mid<br>1980s and I was one of two students in<br>the school's very first El Marti class<br>so me and glennis<br>fromi um and that class was just an<br>oasis so Mama gave me my first education<br>and the role of formal education as a<br>tool for language loss intergenerational<br>language language loss and language<br>revitalization and through her teaching<br>I was also a beneficiary of M toang so<br>learning grounded into Mari um when I<br>announced my decision to come teaching<br>Mama Karen was no longer teaching me or<br>but midama was the only teacher who was<br>positive about going<br>teaching the only one so it's been<br>really amazing to catch up on her Mah<br>recently through my niece Miriam who's<br>one of the latest of many generations<br>who've been Ed from her expertise in<br>teaching the second teacher I want to<br>acknowledge is yosha lelt who's watching<br>via live stream from Malaysia and I met<br>yosha much more recently in 2018 when I<br>lost the ability to speak so I had I had<br>to have lenal surgery and while waiting<br>I signed up for New Zealand sign<br>language classes so yosha opened my eyes<br>to the beautiful world of Al's third<br>official language<br>and to the power of communications<br>yosha so I'm now going to tell you a<br>little bit about my education Journey um<br>and how I ended up doing the research<br>that I'm doing now so by way of a I'll<br>just give a quick summary my early<br>research focused on policy and practice<br>in the context of internationalized<br>higher education and later this expanded<br>to a focus on education Pathways and<br>education Mobility more generally<br>including in contexts of forced<br>displacement so alongside my work has<br>considered the connections between<br>education nationhood and<br>belonging so I started teaching in<br>1993 after major social policy reforms<br>that saw competition introduced to<br>public education and corporatization to<br>tertiary education in Altera and changes<br>to immigration settings and education<br>policy in many countries at the time saw<br>a marked increase in movement across<br>borders for international tery<br>study excuse<br>me and in Alor our export education<br>industry was born so in the late 1990s<br>Greg and I moved to West Virginia for<br>Greg to start work as an international<br>post-doctoral scholar and our daughter<br>Lydia was 11 weeks old at the time<br>crazy so in the US I was a secondary<br>alien we've already heard that with no<br>social security number or work visa and<br>Greg wasn't a student but I was so lucky<br>that there was a group run through the<br>university that he was at um for<br>international students and Scholars<br>partners and um so this group became a<br>really critical source of support for me<br>and was really instrumental in shaping<br>my research experience research<br>interests later it's funny where life<br>leads you eh so after three years we<br>moved back to palmon North for AG Greg<br>to take up a second postto and I started<br>teaching again and then we moved to<br>denan for his third postto um with two<br>children under five and a third on the<br>way and rather than looking for another<br>teaching role I decided to have a go at<br>postgrad study um at the then faculty of<br>Education I was really fortunate to win<br>a scholarship that allowed me to go on<br>to doctoral study and um so this was not<br>a planned move by any means so my<br>doctoral research explored the<br>experiences of international women<br>students and partners of students in the<br>context of export education and at the<br>time International students Partners<br>were really invisible in our National<br>Education policy and I just thought I'd<br>share a photograph of my three research<br>assistants taken in the clubs and socks<br>building where they were constantly<br>moving so it was always blurred<br>yeah so I want to acknowledge four<br>people whose work was really<br>instrumental in shaping that early um<br>academic Journey Keith Ballard was my<br>first lecturer when I came back to study<br>after 10 years away and it was his<br>encouragement that led me to think about<br>doing a doctorate um he said to me one<br>day you know you can write and it was<br>just so amazing to have someone say that<br>um Keith opened my eyes to the power of<br>qualitative research as a way of gaining<br>complex understandings of human social<br>life and his expertise in inclusive<br>education was a huge<br>inspiration Karen you've already met and<br>Jackie licky were my doctoral<br>supervisors Karen gave me tools to think<br>about the role of gender place and space<br>and education and I'm so lucky to keep<br>working with you and Jackie introduced<br>me to anthrop ological and migration<br>literatures and migration research<br>networks and I'm really indebted to<br>these women for my um research<br>training so the per fourth person on<br>this slide is Melissa Lethe and um she's<br>currently the manager of our disability<br>information and support service at Oto<br>faka ihaka and when I was doing my PhD I<br>developed a pain condition which meant I<br>had to switch to using voice activated<br>software and it was Melissa who was the<br>disability adviser who got me hooked up<br>with everything I needed and um<br>literally if it wasn't for her I would<br>not be here today so I'm just so<br>grateful to that service and to Melissa<br>work so my academic Journey since<br>finishing my doctorate takes a bit of<br>explaining so I'll do my best um when I<br>got near the end of my PhD I was really<br>worried about what I'd do next um I<br>remember being told in careers workshops<br>you'll never have an academic career if<br>you stay in the same place and we<br>weren't about to move we just moved<br>three times and Greg now finally had a<br>permanent role so I decided I needed to<br>be flexible in my thinking about what I<br>would do and I was reading the otago<br>Daily Times one Saturday and saw an ad<br>for a dental education support officer<br>and I turned the page and then thought<br>oh maybe I could do that so I turned it<br>back and thought I had nothing to lose<br>so I applied and amazingly I got the job<br>so my 5-year-old son went to school the<br>next day and said my mom's a dentist<br>so I worked at the dental school till<br>2012 and um then a lectureship came up<br>at the College of Education and I was<br>really worried they wouldn't want me but<br>applied and I was very lucky to get that<br>job so I moved over there and I taught<br>an initial teacher education and<br>education studies programs and then in<br>2015 moved to the University's higher<br>education development center so the<br>College of education's the pretty one<br>with the Blossom and the higher<br>education Cent is the big house um so<br>and there I was involved in supporting<br>learning and teaching across the<br>university and then in 2021 the College<br>of Education advertised another role and<br>I applied and they very kindly took me<br>now so I'm I feel so lucky to have<br>worked with so many amazing people and<br>just colleagues and students right<br>across the university in these different<br>roles um but tonight I'm just going to<br>touch on three projects that link with<br>my earlier research and the work I do<br>now just to kind of explain this weird<br>trajectory that I've gone on so in the<br>dental school most of my research<br>supported curriculum development and<br>evaluation and one highlight um that<br>I'll I'll just briefly talk about was<br>the or niho project so this was a copapa<br>Mari research project funded by the um<br>New Zealand Dental Council and it was<br>co-led with professor John Bron and tipu<br>Order charitable trust at Orin so this<br>ISU um and the project informed the<br>development of the Ora niho outplacement<br>program where um final year Dental<br>students went on placement for 6 weeks<br>with e based oral health providers<br>around the north island so goals of the<br>program were to Foster mainly non-mar<br>Dental students competence working with<br>Faro Mai and to attract Rahi to<br>Dentistry as a possible<br>career um this project really open my<br>eyes to think about education and health<br>in order to um address broader systemic<br>inequities so so to think Beyond<br>education um and it was also really um<br>opened my eyes to the significance of<br>place and place-based relationships and<br>education so it was really exciting last<br>year to discover that one of the Rahi<br>from who became involved in the orho<br>project with us is now a dentist and<br>lecturer here at otako faka ihaka so I'm<br>going to give a shout out to Dr Kur Lacy<br>who's watching from<br>Auto yeah<br>after I moved to the College of<br>Education um I was involved in another<br>project that focused on place and<br>education Pathways and this was the<br>beginning teachers project so this was<br>led um it was funded through a<br>university of otaro research Grant and<br>coed with Sharon Young and um two<br>research assistants Lee Smith and key<br>blanch who helped us with that so we set<br>out with um we set up to follow the<br>return experiences of graduates of a<br>twinned initial teacher education<br>program so they'd studied to be teachers<br>in sarak Malaysia and um denan and then<br>they returned and they were bonded to um<br>the Malaysian government and we followed<br>a small cohort of New Zealand based<br>graduates<br>alongside so the Malaysian teachers were<br>mostly placed in underperforming rural<br>schools in Saba Malaysia and um tasked<br>with turning around student outcomes and<br>although novice teachers they found<br>themselves positioned as overseas<br>educated experts on their return So This<br>research illust rated the complex work<br>new teachers do to stay well find<br>enjoyment and navigate ethical and<br>professional commitments to Children and<br>Families in places shaped by particular<br>policy expectations and requirements and<br>both groups of new teachers grappled<br>with accountability requirements<br>Malaysian teachers had to report<br>regularly on student outcomes while<br>teaching in very low resource schools<br>and Incredibly complex conditions and<br>the New Zealand teachers were required<br>to report student outcomes against the<br>national standards remember them<br>and some schools in ways that cause<br>public shame to<br>Children So based on our research we<br>argued for the need to pay attention to<br>the ethical and emotional complexity of<br>new teachers work when policy or School<br>directives are at odds with their<br>beliefs about children's needs and we<br>also argued for the need to pay<br>attention to the implications of place<br>an internationalized education how<br>knowledge travels or doesn't how it's<br>translated in context and how we might<br>equip crossborder students for the<br>complexities of<br>return the third project I'll talk about<br>just briefly um is the education<br>Journeys project and this was a<br>collaboration with Rachel rafy a<br>colleague in peace and conflict studies<br>who's now in in Derby Derby and Tiffany<br>Con uh in Oto alumna and visiting<br>scholar with our Center for Global<br>migrations and this was funded through<br>the center for Global migrations and a<br>university Improvement University of<br>atago improvement Grant so at the time<br>um Tiffany was working at the Asian<br>University for women in Bangladesh which<br>is a philanthropic University with a<br>commitment to educating displaced and<br>stateless women and our study explored<br>the educational narratives of women<br>engaged in international study either as<br>International students or as an outcome<br>of forced<br>migration we were really interested in<br>how women navigated higher education in<br>the challenges and enablers they<br>encountered and in their aspirations for<br>the future and this was uh we used<br>biographical interviews um with 37 women<br>and 10 who were forcibly<br>displaced so most women foregrounded<br>family and Community as as really<br>Central to their thinking about<br>education um but the research also<br>highlighted the different levels of risk<br>that students take on when they engage<br>in tertiary study forcibly displaced<br>students in both contexts articulated a<br>really sense of really heavy sense of<br>responsibility to succeed on behalf of<br>families and whole communities and based<br>on this work we argued for the need to<br>think about internationalized education<br>in terms of relationality and<br>responsibility not just Revenue<br>generation or brand recognition and to<br>support students agency as change makers<br>for families and communities um ensuring<br>that our own institutional processes and<br>practices lessen rather than increase<br>the risks that students carry when they<br>engage with tertiary study so this<br>project alerted us to some really major<br>structural barriers in denan faced by<br>Refugee background students who wanted<br>to engage in tertiary study and as an<br>outcome of this project a group of US<br>established a collective aimed at<br>troubleshooting some of these challenges<br>so I was based in the HDC at the<br>time the pathways to tertiary education<br>network is still going and it includes<br>University polych um New Zealand Red<br>Cross Ministry of Education business<br>self and student representation I think<br>we've got one of the student<br>Representatives here somewhere I think<br>there she is um so initially we met<br>monthly and we continue to meet every<br>school<br>term so in 2019 as a collective we<br>applied for Ministry of Education<br>funding through a teaching and learning<br>research initiative Grant um to run a<br>project with Refugee background young<br>people in southern Al and we were<br>successful and it's this project that<br>I'll focus on for the rest of this<br>lecture so I'm just going to give some<br>context before I talk about this project<br>and I want to acknowledge that some<br>colleagues have heard this before so<br>apologies if you've heard this<br>before earlier I mentioned the scale of<br>global displacement um that we're<br>dealing with at present and this graph<br>is from the 2023 midyear report from the<br>UN HCR and it shows the number of people<br>forced to flee from their home since<br>2009 and you can see that the number has<br>more than doubled until 2023 so from<br>just over 40 million in 2009 to over 110<br>million last year and the forecasts this<br>people access to education is profoundly<br>difficult for people who are forcibly<br>displaced and in 2023 around a third of<br>forcibly displaced people were granted<br>Refugee status so only a third um by the<br>unhcr um and around half of those under<br>18 were out of school and only about 6%<br>accessed secondary education so the the<br>numbers are much worse if you include<br>all forcibly displaced people but there<br>aren't stats<br>available New Zealand is a signatur to<br>the 1951 convention and 1967 protocol<br>relating to the status of refugees and<br>is one of around 37 countries<br>internationally that accept an annual<br>quota of refugees through the United<br>Nations High Commissioner for refugees<br>and that's currently 1500 people so it's<br>a very small number on an international<br>scale but New Zealand prioritizes<br>refugees who have um um who are deemed<br>to be have complex needs or to be<br>emergency cases or um women at risk and<br>we also receive a smaller number of<br>people through Asylum seeking processes<br>um or through family reunification<br>processes and Community sponsorship<br>programs so when quota refugees arrive<br>in New Zealand they housed in the mang<br>Refugee resettlement Center for 5 weeks<br>and provided with a orientation program<br>health checks access to education and so<br>on<br>and following that time they allocated<br>housing and designated settlement<br>centers so denan became one in 2016 and<br>inago in 2018 and when our project began<br>in 2020 the southern part of Tio numu<br>was the primary resettlement region for<br>the<br>country so resettlement and Al was<br>Guided by this strategy document the<br>refugee resettlement strategy and that<br>was refreshed last year so this is a new<br>version um following an extensive period<br>of consultation and you can see has five<br>outcomes goals um one of which is<br>education but Refugee background<br>students are invisible in National<br>Education policy so education is an<br>outcome's goal in resettlement policy<br>but education policy doesn't recognize<br>the presence of former<br>refugees um unless local Ministry of<br>Education officers see recognized people<br>as priority Learners so this means that<br>there's no publicly available data on<br>Refugee background students access or<br>outcomes to education and institutional<br>practices vary<br>widely so our study started in March<br>2020 alongside the first covid-19<br>lockdown<br>woohoo and it was a three-year<br>participatory action research project so<br>this is a way of doing research where<br>you work with participants to design the<br>research as you go on and to determine<br>how to share the findings and the out<br>and what to do with them um so the<br>project was open to any young people<br>who'd come to New Zealand as refugees<br>and were 16 and based in denan or in<br>Vago in secondary school um or and<br>wanting to engage in terer study um so<br>some actually weren't currently in<br>secondary school but wanted to engage in<br>tertiary study in total we had 44 young<br>people join the project so 29 in denan<br>and 15 and inago and most had come to<br>New Zealand three years or less before<br>the project started their families had<br>been displaced from Syria Afghanistan<br>Palestine and Colombia<br>so our aims were to explore with these<br>young people how they imagined<br>experienced and navigated the secondary<br>to tertiary education transition and the<br>institutional practices that supported<br>or disrupted their access to education<br>and how their experiences could inform<br>teaching and support practices more<br>widely and this is the project team um<br>so on the left Joe Ori from the<br>University of otago I should make you<br>stand up but I won't and Fraser Smith<br>from otago poly Technic an inago teacher<br>Glenda Atkins is below um Amber and then<br>on the right are my three amazing<br>assistant research fellows Ali Mo day<br>Alejandra Ortiz<br>aala and Anna Bergen so awesome<br>people our project revolved around<br>regular workshops with the young people<br>and we planned them with them initially<br>on zoom and then face to face once we<br>were allowed to meet and this is a BL<br>screenshot of our very first Workshop<br>held online using three languages across<br>four cities it was<br>wild so we began by asking the students<br>to make education Maps as a way of<br>exploring with them their intended<br>education Pathways and hoped for futures<br>and I'm just going to share a few of<br>them some students represented their<br>future education Pathways in very linear<br>terms with clearly identified options<br>others were more uh revealed less<br>certainty and more ambig<br>most represented their educational<br>aspirations as shaped and supported<br>through relationships with other people<br>and wider social commitments and some<br>noted the emotion work involved in<br>navigating education in the face of<br>really difficult life experiences and I<br>pseudonyms so we developed subsequent<br>workshops based on what young people<br>were interested in and in consultation<br>with them and I'll just give you a sense<br>of some of the topics they included<br>educational and career Pathways<br>part-time work opportunities and job<br>seeking options for funding tertiary<br>study application processes for tertiary<br>study um stress and coping study skills<br>and we organized field trips to uh<br>different tery institutions and our data<br>included Maps photographs film Workshop<br>discussions peer and onetoone interviews<br>our workshops served as a means to both<br>generate knowledge with young people and<br>to provide access to Pathways<br>information and mentoring and we also<br>used workshops to share what we were<br>learning through the research and to<br>plan with them what to do with that<br>knowledge so without exception young<br>people expressed very high expectations<br>of Education in New Zealand as a pathway<br>to a better life for themselves and<br>their families and some explicitly<br>linked these expectations with promises<br>made by un agents and staff at mangad<br>for example anyone can go to university<br>with or without documentation<br>gaps in schooling don't<br>matter in practice young people's<br>education Pathways were mostly nonlinear<br>as they negotiated challenges associated<br>with settling in a new place variable<br>levels of institutional support Pathways<br>guidance resettlement support access to<br>specialist language teaching and New<br>Zealand's profoundly complex and<br>disconnected educational infrastructure<br>so think NCA study link zero fees<br>institutional Admissions and enrollment<br>processes none of which<br>connect alongside gaps in wider Social<br>Services impacted on many young people's<br>access to education so some left<br>education to care for unwell caregivers<br>some managed household budgets and tency<br>agreements while trying to study and<br>many had to skip school at times or<br>leave school alog together to act as<br>interpreters for family<br>members young people made connections<br>between structural factors School<br>practices peer interactions and a sense<br>of belonging or unbelonging in<br>ALA teachers and school leaders<br>communicated unwelcome by conflating<br>English language proficiency with<br>academic capability excluding English<br>language Learners from classroom or<br>extracurricular activities failing to<br>take bullying seriously and in two cases<br>refusing<br>enrollment where young people were<br>refused access to school lack of access<br>to education or to English language<br>pathways outside school limited access<br>to other<br>options so two young people made a<br>really explicit connection between this<br>and a wider sense of national belonging<br>um Daniel said we don't feel we belong<br>here we feel this place is not for us we<br>don't deserve to be here and Whitney who<br>was unable to access education through<br>our whole project suggested that for 18<br>and 19 year olds resettlement and Altera<br>harm on the other hand young people<br>Associated a sense of Welcome with<br>support from mentors new friends and<br>allies classroom activities that<br>fostered Connection staff who took<br>students academic aspirations seriously<br>responsive flexible teaching that<br>supported access to learning<br>accommodations for nonlinear Pathways<br>And Timely appropriate navigational<br>support so this is some of the work that<br>we've published based on this project<br>and um I'll just summarize some of our<br>key learning so our search really<br>highlighted the sheer grit and<br>resourcefulness required of young people<br>who are former refugees trying to<br>navigate New Zealand's complex<br>educational landscape at the secondary<br>tertiary education border while managing<br>the many other challenges associated<br>with displacement and resettlement and<br>we argue that a competitive assessment<br>focused schooling system um at senior<br>secondary level may work against<br>inclusive practices and create risks for<br>young people when coupled with gaps in<br>wider social infrastructure limited<br>pathways options in a really really<br>complex tery education environment that<br>relies on um access to electronic<br>infrastructure as well so we've argued<br>for the need to address policy gaps that<br>render Refugee background students<br>invisible in education and that leave<br>much to chance for people who want to<br>engage in education and we've noted that<br>ironically um New Zealand may be meeting<br>its promises as a signatory to the<br>refugee convention and according to<br>refugees the same same treatment as is<br>accorded to Nationals because we know<br>that we've got long-standing in evidence<br>of inequities for many uh groups within<br>ala but we argue that in the face of<br>structural barriers individual teachers<br>School leaders and tertiary education<br>staff play a really critical role in<br>enabling or disrupting students access<br>to education and education Pathways and<br>micr level interactions and education<br>settings broker a broader sense of<br>belonging or not belonging um in context<br>of resettlement<br>so a highlight of the project was the<br>creation of this full length documentary<br>film and I can't see Ellie but I know<br>he's here um this was not just dreams<br>and it was the most amazing piece of<br>work led by Ali MOA day in collaboration<br>with the film crew a group of our young<br>people um who create co-created the film<br>with with Ali and some of whom are here<br>so the film was funded by our grant with<br>additional funding from the center for<br>Global migrations and UNESCO and we<br>premiered the film and dened an Chicago<br>at the end of 2022 um Awesome<br>event these are some of the crew and<br>stars along with blurred photographs of<br>family members and friends at the inago<br>premiere so I wish we could have just<br>had the film here tonight instead of an<br>IPL but it's was a bit<br>long and I would say we're working on um<br>submitting it for film festival release<br>so if anyone wants to bank roll it see<br>me<br>later so I've really enjoyed this<br>different experience of communicating<br>research um and I really need to thank<br>Ellie for his expertise in this work and<br>Puna who supported our trips to inago um<br>we've shared excepts of this film with<br>students and initial teacher education<br>and my wonderful colleague in otago<br>alumna Dr Mariam Abdul diim is utilizing<br>it as a professional development tool<br>nationally through the Ministry of<br>exciting so I want to conclude by<br>returning to the faki that I shared at<br>the start of this lecture this is the<br>last slide you know<br>breathe<br>fire moroto so this image was taken at<br>Aurora College which was our host School<br>in inago um and the words say Manaka<br>Faro and family which are really<br>appropriate to go back to as I close<br>this off and just a few final<br>Reflections so in this piece that I<br>wrote with Zoe Bristo a former colleague<br>in h of Mai here at Oto we thought about<br>how manga might help us to think<br>differently about internationalized<br>education in ways that respond to the<br>many challenges facing our world we drew<br>on three questions that Charles Royal<br>argues are Central to Mar who am I what<br>is this world that I exist in and what<br>am I to do we considered how practices<br>in education might look differently if<br>we took seriously values drawn from M<br>such as kak manak and F including the<br>role of Education to strengthen<br>relationships that sustain<br>life and contributors to this book which<br>I co-edited with Henry Johnson um<br>provided some insights into what this<br>might look like in practice for example<br>by examining the histories that shape<br>contemporary education attending to<br>rights resources and relationships in<br>education settings and utilizing<br>teaching practices that are firm and<br>sustain home<br>languages and I'm currently working with<br>Pacific colleagues from tii one of the<br>up there um to think about this in terms<br>of Lear so ideas of relationality drawn<br>from broader<br>Oceania so um I look forward to seeing<br>what you do Jess in your role as Deputy<br>Vice Chancellor external engagement um<br>the University's recent TOA work is a I<br>think a really hopeful manga based<br>reorientation that places Fina and manaa<br>at the center as grounds for ethical<br>external engagement and I'm really<br>interested to see what that looks like<br>moving forward so um for now sincere<br>thanks to all of you for being part of<br>my educational Collective for your<br>encouragement collegiality and for<br>coming along tonight um and I want to<br>acknowledge all of my research<br>collaborators who I haven't named<br>tonight and my amazing postgrad doctoral<br>summer and coursework students um and my<br>many research participants as well and I<br>just want to also especially thanks<br>down in who are watching this over<br>dinner um I wish I could have been with<br>you guys so thank you for reminding me<br>daily that this was coming up and for<br>for<br>take<br>take<br>hee<br>um I get the privilege uh granted to me<br>by the current proce Chancellor of<br>humanities Professor Hugh Campbell of<br>giving the vote of confidence uh or vote<br>of thanks to Viv um confidence and<br>thanks<br>easily um so I'm currently the DBC of<br>external engagement for those of you who<br>don't know me I just recently moved into<br>that role and for the last three and a<br>half years I've been the provis St of<br>humanities which is the division in<br>which the College of Education sits so I<br>have had the wonderful pleasure of<br>working closely with Viv uh through<br>these last few years and I'm going to<br>um one of the things I do when I do<br>these and this is quite emotional<br>because it's my last one but it's<br>particularly emotional because it's you<br>um but I normally ask for an Advan copy<br>of the lecture which is exactly what<br>happened with this one and ver email and<br>she said I I always just thought you you<br>got up and gave those thanks for you<br>know<br>just<br>no I do read them ahead um but sometimes<br>I prepare my thanks ahead of time and<br>and I therefore kind of go with the head<br>and sometimes I choose to go with the<br>heart and it just depends but<br>tonight I chose not to prepare my notes<br>ah head and to go with the heart and I<br>and having sat there and listening and<br>realizing what I've come out with I can<br>see why so I want to in my vote of<br>thanks comment on three aspects of Viv<br>as a professor um as a person and as a<br>leader so first of all as a professor um<br>the kind of the purpose of ipls is<br>partly to embrace and thank and<br>acknowledge and she your journey and she<br>did that beautifully but the other<br>aspect of the IPL traditionally um in<br>days long gone by it was meant to be a<br>kind of public proof of the fact that<br>you were good enough to be professor and<br>at that stage all we meant by Professor<br>back in those dark days was that you<br>were a superb researcher thankfully our<br>um criteria for that has broadened to uh<br>to to teaching and to service which you<br>saw but I want to just make that point<br>that I think you proved that well to us<br>right so it was a wonderful IPL but we<br>got to see clearly that you are<br>absolutely obviously and without a date<br>doubt a stellar researcher and that the<br>research doing is incredibly valuable<br>and so the first thing I wanted to just<br>comment on Viv was that you have shown<br>in your research that you are a fierce<br>Advocate and not all researchers are we<br>can have great researchers and you can<br>be great for lots of reasons but VI I<br>just want to just to acknowledge and and<br>affirm that your research is about<br>fighting for or pursuing something<br>important to<br>us um and when you think about what you<br>know what what academics are meant to do<br>we often hear the lawyers in the room<br>will always tell you that the statute<br>says we're meant to be the critic and<br>conscience of society and I think we saw<br>that beautifully displayed tonight that<br>that is what Viv does and um I have so<br>appreciated as I know your colleagues in<br>the college have particularly while<br>you've been Dean your willingness to<br>step into some very public debates right<br>now about education what matters and<br>what was beautiful from that talk was<br>that we can see that has been a theme in<br>your research since day one that you<br>believe um absolutely in the value of<br>Education Beyond it being a good it's<br>not and you said this at the beginning<br>it's not something that can be bought<br>and sold and for those of us who sit in<br>the clock tower trying to figure out how<br>to cover the cost of this place it's a<br>good thing to be reminded of right it<br>isn't something that's merely can be<br>bought and sold and secondly you said<br>it's not just about skill equity<br>we're not um in the business here or in<br>the in the activity here of just getting<br>people ready for jobs that's not what<br>education is about it's about Liberty<br>and freedom and doing the best for our<br>neighbors and I think we could see that<br>come through so strongly so Viv thank<br>you and well<br>down secondly and this carries on um<br>from that point and watching her<br>demonstrate that viv's research<br>um as is everything she does is<br>motivated by a deep care and empathy for<br>people at heart you can see in Viv so<br>clearly that<br>questioni being answered so loudly and<br>proudly right it's about people and she<br>has this huge sense of care for people<br>and people matter to her and you can see<br>in her research that that is always at<br>the heart of it that the question that<br>she's really asking what can we do<br>better<br>to serve the<br>other bravo<br>bravo the other thing I like about that<br>and and I've I have seen glimpses of<br>this when I have talked to some of her<br>students and when I've seen some things<br>that have had to come through to me that<br>she's worked on um that the other<br>wonderful thing about that care and<br>empathy you have for people of Viv is<br>that you live out that sense of true<br>teachers being those who are Learners<br>alongside their tow um and I think that<br>that huge project where it was about<br>designing the research with the subjects<br>and she didn't even use the word<br>subjects because she was that's not what<br>they are right they're people um but<br>that's a great example of you living<br>that out you are here to learn from from<br>others just as much as you're here to<br>teach them so again Bravo Viv and then<br>thirdly I wanted to comment on viv's<br>leadership so one of the important<br>overlying qualities to now be promoted<br>to Professor<br>is that you need to be a leader in all<br>of those three Fields you need to show<br>leadership in your research and your<br>teaching and in your service um and she<br>has done that well and truly but I just<br>wanted to com comment on what has been<br>the most obvious demonstration of her<br>leadership in the last couple of years<br>and that has been as dean of the College<br>of<br>Education I have seen in you VI um an<br>incredible determination to do well and<br>to do right by your college and your<br>staff and to do that in the midst of<br>incredible challenges externally<br>politically but also internally when<br>we've had to figure out how to make the<br>numbers work to get what we're really<br>trying to do here and secondly V you<br>have done that in a deeply human way so<br>your colleagues and your staff see you<br>not just as a leader they see you as a<br>friend they see you as a confident and<br>they see you as an advocate and I think<br>and I don't think you'd mind me saying<br>this we have lots of one ones as um as<br>I'm her direct boss a was for a while<br>and in those one-on ones you have shown<br>the deeply human sight you know there<br>have been moments where she has been<br>incredibly excited and happy and and<br>loving the<br>job and then there have been the other<br>moments and we have cried and um<br>together and separately and she has<br>raged about some things and she has<br>pushed back against me um and we have<br>always tried to find the right answer<br>together and and I think that is much to<br>your credit you feel your leadership as<br>much as you think it and I think your<br>colleagues in the college are all the<br>so you lead with heart and head and I<br>want to thank you and I thought i' just<br>quickly share she knows this because I<br>made the point of telling her but it's<br>nice the rest of you to know um I in as<br>in part of being PVC and I appoint was I<br>used to so I need to talk in the past<br>tense I appointed academic leaders<br>regularly of programs and of of colleges<br>and so we appointed Viv as Dean uh<br>2020 two um and very recently we<br>discussed whether she wanted to stay on<br>or not and uh there was a bit of back<br>and forward not being sure particularly<br>given all the challenges but she decided<br>she<br>would and I then went to the college and<br>sent them an email and said this is what<br>I'm proposing I think she's a stellar<br>leader I need your feedback what what do<br>you think and I do this with all the<br>units or departments um that I appoint<br>leaders for but what was wonderful and I<br>told R this what was wonderful was how<br>quickly and how loud and how positive<br>that feedback was so Viv you know your<br>colleagues are definite about the<br>affirmation of your leadership they are<br>so proud that you are their Dean and<br>they're incredibly grateful for the work<br>that you've been doing with them and I'm<br>looking over at them because I know<br>that's the case um I want to thank you<br>um our kimah of the college for your<br>commitment to the college for your<br>commitment to education particularly in<br>the face of so many challenges at the<br>moment and I want to thank you for your<br>support of Viv I know in a sense it's<br>easily one because she's a wonderful<br>leader but it is also you know it's hard<br>fought to keep it going in this stage so<br>I want to thank you all for your<br>commitment to education and to it in<br>this current um landscape that we're<br>in<br>so<br>Anderson you are a treasure you are a<br>tonga for us I have the pleasure um of<br>presenting you with a gift and a momento<br>of this evening as a small sign of our<br>appreciation<br>and it's so much fun having an<br>interpreter with us thank you it's been<br>wonderful um to the audience both online<br>and here in person thank you so much for<br>being with us thank you for those of you<br>who have come can to kohi it's lovely to<br>share and fellowship with you and to<br>those online wherever you are we<br>appreciate you zooming in so for those<br>of you who are here in person we would<br>love you to come over with us um so hi I<br>for some cup of tea some Kai and some<br>time to celebrate with Viv and her<br>family um please do come with us it's in<br>the staff Club just across it's not too<br>far and stay for some time of fellowship<br>with us so thank you thank you one thank<br>you all thank you for your
