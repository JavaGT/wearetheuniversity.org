Indeed, much of behavioural ecologyâ€™s success has come testing theory across a range of species. But such an approach has costs: after all, why not study Drosophila? Here I review two decades of studying sexual selection in Lygaeus bugs. After early work on sexual conflict, it became clear that Lygaeus displays some unusual features, centring around high levels of mating failure. Approximately 40-60% of matings do not involve sperm transfer. I will review evidence for post-copulatory cryptic male choice for large, more fecund females, but contrast this with the low level of pre-copulatory mate choice, including high levels of reproductive interference within and among lygaeid genera. Lygaeus challenges our views of mating systems and mate choice and suggests that bugs and other non-model systems might take us to different parts of mating system parameter space.<br><br>Biography: David is a behavioural ecologist interested in the evolution and ecology of reproductive behaviour, particularly in insects. He has worked on a range of different species, and his research has focused primarily on sexual selection, sexual conflict, and sex allocation. After an Ecology degree from the University of Sheffield, David did his PhD in the Institute of Genetics at the University of Nottingham, followed by post-docs in Manchester, Leeds, and Edinburgh. He was a NERC Advanced Research Fellow and moved to the University of St Andrews in 2009. His research group combine field and lab studies, encompassing genetic through to whole organism behavioural approaches. A Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society, watching insects have sex remains his abiding passion.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically

but sure<br>everyone tell<br>us um<br>yeah um today we're very luy Dave who's<br>here all the way from University of St<br>Andrews in Scotland um he's been doing a<br>world wi tour of New Zealand labs and<br>I'm very<br>pop by W for a few days um so Dave is a<br>evolutionary colist colist probably all<br>of those words um mostly working on<br>insect reproductive Behavior Uh he had a<br>psychology degree from the University of<br>Sheffield uh and then did his PhD in The<br>Institute of genetics um at University<br>of Nottingham and then had posts from<br>all over the show throughout the UK so<br>Manchester leads of Edinburgh um and a<br>nerk Fellowship um and then started at<br>St Andrews and<br>2009 um and so his group works on a<br>whole variety of um approaches field and<br>La based approaches um studying andc<br>mating systems um he's also a fellow of<br>the roal eological society and my<br>favorite thing is edited this very great<br>book<br>on which I was trying to see on my shelf<br>before day and I couldn't see it I do<br>have<br>itly um and I met Dave once before which<br>was when I was a little baby actually<br>student um some time ago now interal<br>International Congress of emology Ino<br>Korea and I think we shared some gen<br>chcken but I don't know I got very bad<br>food poisoning on that shuck so don't<br>have great memories but anyway um so<br>yeah very very luy to Dave here you<br>thank you well thanks Chris thanks for<br>coming um it's really nice to be able to<br>talk um about my work over here and what<br>this is what I'm all about so this is<br>sex and cannibalism okay and there's two<br>species of here there's mating there's<br>cism there's juveniles getting involved<br>as well and it's that kind of diversity<br>of mating and reproductive behavior um<br>that I'm going to talk to you about<br>today first off I like to start with my<br>thank yous um first uh so we've got a<br>whole range of PhD students here Maddie<br>who's coming in her third year down to<br>um Ellie who's just finished really a<br>range of PhD students across recent<br>years who have contributed to this work<br>we also have a series of undergraduate<br>and and Master students who've helped<br>Nina Vell who I worked with when I was<br>post looking leads doing something else<br>when we first got interested in the bugs<br>and then this is a feso the cat and this<br>is a a cat we have uh forly adopted as<br>the lab cat this was uh him appearing<br>with us is sisy and he will make an<br>appearance later on as well uh and<br>various people kindly gave us<br>money so so this is probably my favorite<br>picture in in all of biology it's sort<br>of insect<br>pornography um I'm going describe here a<br>mating positions across the whole of the<br>oropo so we have cockroaches maned<br>grasshoppers crickets Bush crickets and<br>so and what you see in black are the<br>males and the females are in white so<br>basically you have a whole range of<br>different positions where sometimes the<br>male is on top sometimes the female<br>sometimes male is being haplessly<br>dragged around by the female so on and<br>and given that you know sperm transfer<br>in sexual internally fertilizing<br>organisms should be reasonbly conserved<br>you know both males and females are<br>trying to do the same thing give and<br>receive sperm why do we see such an<br>extraordinary diversity something which<br>should be as you know basic as the<br>actual ma position and it's trying to<br>understand diversity like this that I'm<br>really interested<br>in just I know you might not all be<br>Behavior ecologist or even biologist so<br>just so we're all on the same page um<br>when I talk about natural selection it's<br>broad sense I'm talking about<br>competition for genetic representation<br>in the Next Generation which of course<br>that competition can favor all sorts of<br>traits basically anything you can<br>take natural selection is more sort of<br>original darwinian narrow sense um is<br>competition for genetic representation<br>via traits like viability longevity<br>for but Darwin realized that some traits<br>you see in organisms aren't very good in<br>terms of viability and so forth and you<br>realize you need another fitness<br>component which is the competition for<br>access to Gams but the obviously sex and<br>that's what sex selection is I put this<br>here because um our recent Focus<br>and my recent focus on a definition that<br>really focuses on<br>gamt um is the right definition um but<br>it's also a little bit controversial I'm<br>happy to talk about that down the<br>p on and then finally in terms of mating<br>systems what I mean are the where when<br>how and how often individuals come<br>together as a mate so really the<br>description in which competition for<br>access to mates and gamt takes place so<br>just kind of put orientate us all on the<br>same<br>page so so really kind of the the<br>underlying theme of this talk is the<br>role of model and non-model<br>species um and strengths and weaknesses<br>of of either I think a key strength of<br>Behavioral ecology across its history<br>and we can think of it you know starting<br>in the mid 1970s with leaders like John<br>Krebs and Nick<br>Davis PE strength of Behavioral ecology<br>is in it's testing adaptive hypotheses<br>of behavior and indeed life history<br>traits and so on across many species and<br>you know just SE looking at the Krebs<br>and Davis grownup addition or the<br>introduction to behavior ecology we see<br>a variety of species on display and I<br>think behavioral ecology has used a lot<br>of species because you know performing<br>one test of an Adaptive hypothesis like<br>a sex elocation experiment and a parid<br>wasp doing it in a there species like<br>the son V tenis is all work well but<br>when you actually do similar experiments<br>acoss 20 30 40 species then you really<br>think that that that theory um has some<br>robustness so there been a key strength<br>I think that we've used a lot of species<br>in behaviorology<br>but what about sexual selection<br>itself well if you go into web science a<br>few days ago and you type in sexual<br>selection in quotes and then either<br>justop anagasta CIA reticul which is a<br>guppy Gast osteras which is three spine<br>sickle back or Gillis the genus of<br>ground crickets you get a lot of papers<br>on those species now some of these<br>papers may not be particularly on that<br>given species the way people use<br>keywords and so on um but nonetheless<br>you see that drop Guppies sticklebacks<br>and Gill Cricket have been studied an<br>awful lot in terms of sexual selection<br>that's not a particularly novel<br>observation Marlin zuk Lee Simmons and<br>Mariel herish wrote this lovely paper a<br>few years ago now looking at model and<br>non-model species in in sexual selection<br>sex conflict of course you can't read<br>that that's too small but if we just<br>focus in the most common species are<br>mananas 10% of Articles and just the<br>genus say 23% of articles are just on<br>one genus so there just been a really<br>concent ation of study on a remarkably<br>few number of<br>organisms so a little bit of um audience<br>participation how many papers do you<br>think have been on Paro stus so the P<br>male being the peacock how many studies<br>would you hit if you put in Paratus and<br>sexual selection<br>five 15<br>15 gave this talk on Monday and Oakland<br>they're much more optim<br>they were like starting in aund so<br>you've gone the other way fascinating<br>isn't it who'd be a standup comic you<br>never know going to get back anyway 21<br>so 21 studies<br>ontis um and of course you know this<br>peacock spider and the genous maratus<br>has become a another poster child for<br>sexual selection uh you guys are lucky<br>down here in austral Asia this is where<br>they hang out rather wonderful um gen of<br>jumping spiders but actually<br>there are only five you hit six but one<br>not a bad J only five papers have<br>actually studied sexual selection<br>there's much more in taxonomy and people<br>finding them and they looking beautiful<br>but in terms of actually measuring<br>sexual selection on these<br>wonderful species there are remarkably<br>few<br>studies<br>now there are lotss of benefits of of<br>studying um modal species you end up<br>with a very big Bank of data lots of<br>studies lots of detail in depth you can<br>really start to get a nuances of things<br>um and particular in the case of using<br>species like Drop and melanogaster gives<br>you great technical um sophistication<br>and flexibility particularly in terms of<br>using molecular genetics to knock down<br>traits all this and that and actually<br>allow you to to tease apart behavior um<br>in many many useful ways but of course<br>the costs is that can give you a rather<br>narrow View of sexual selection and what<br>mating systems are out there in the wild<br>it can rify what is normal for sexual<br>selection so basically one studies of<br>sexual selection become self-filling<br>prophecies and you know then it's harder<br>to study or to fund um strange systems<br>where we potentially don't noce much<br>about what's going on people go well why<br>S of course this is a broader problem<br>and and for those of you are sexual<br>selection hopefully the the talk is<br>interesting really just in a case of<br>kind of a case study that you know um<br>non-model species can open your eyes to<br>to things that you might still might not<br>be<br>expected so why study Li so lias is a<br>genus of hitan seed bugs they're kind of<br>pretty um because they're they're toxic<br>so they have aposematic warning colation<br>R and black war and<br>coloration why study them well the main<br>reason was so you can get feel Sicily<br>and that's you know a big a big plus um<br>the real reason why Nina Vell and I<br>started um was you know the end of the<br>1990s early 2000s I show my age um<br>sexual conflict over mating was very<br>much in fashion I did my PhD on sexual<br>Conflict at C flies and as this figure<br>here again from from Z 2014 shows you<br>know insects have really dominated<br>sexual conflict research we were it was<br>a thing we were all interested<br>in and pilot work with Nina suggested<br>that there were really large cost of<br>mating females in like as and we didn't<br>have that kind of dark secret of the the<br>costum mating work in jop where actually<br>the the famous costum mating and cost of<br>sex pepid so are really nutrition<br>dependent and and you know I got a<br>little bit of money from asab while I<br>was supposed to be working on Paris was<br>and did a study we published a on<br>posting all very<br>good but while we're starting to do this<br>work and and collect here this is a site<br>in this north of Mount there in Sicily<br>came across some rather curious<br>things so this is an adult my guess<br>creticus of Western R edge of its<br>distribution is in Sicily this is a<br>nymph a fifth instar NY it has one more<br>Mal to go to turn into an adult and the<br>male is trying to have sex with it and<br>it's properly trying it's averting it<br>genitalia it's really trying to make<br>this nymph and they can't make they they<br>you know there's no point to doing it<br>but it wasn't the only time I saw it and<br>again here is a male trying to populate<br>with a nymph and again it it's properly<br>getting interested with its<br>genitalia so what's going on<br>well misplaced matings in insects are<br>perhaps more common than we might think<br>this is perhaps the most famous example<br>for a Pap by Daryl Gwyn many years ago<br>where you have an imit Australian Beetle<br>um trying to have sex with a beer bottle<br>and what what's fabulous about this is<br>that the beer bottle is brown like the<br>beetle but at the base it has this<br>stipping which is what the elytra of the<br>be also have so this m is probably<br>thinking Christmas has come this huge<br>female um and what I love about I love I<br>love the Shadow and see the penis the<br>shadow of the penis as well so you know<br>misplaced matings I mean amusingly or<br>not they they they certainly happen in<br>in<br>insects and this this kind of work got<br>um myself and Emily B steel was a PhD<br>student at the time interested in what's<br>called reproduct interference so this is<br>when individuals of one species engage<br>with reproductive behavior of<br>individuals of another species and at<br>least one of those species suff as cost<br>that kind of like unpleasant examples<br>like seals and Penguins um course<br>reproductive interance can also happen<br>pollinator systems when pollen from<br>different species of plant get uh<br>pollinators and reproduct interference<br>can happen in all sorts of ways through<br>signal jamming if different species are<br>calling or pheromone signaling at the<br>same time it can be hard to find mates<br>disrupted mate searching you know<br>heteros speciic rivalry different Spees<br>of the dragonly will for the same<br>reproductive sources uh so forth and<br>then the kind of thing I tend to be more<br>interested in is actually is when<br>culation goes wrong when you basically<br>end up trying to have sex with the Rong<br>of<br>species now reproductive uh interference<br>tends to be associated with a failure in<br>species discrimination it doesn't really<br>have to is not totally predicated upon<br>it but I won't talk about that too much<br>today but importantly even back in this<br>very important review by G and H back in<br>2008 it's not an anecdote know it's it's<br>not necessarily that uncommon it happens<br>quite a lot uh over 167 examples in the<br>literature back in 2008 and I think one<br>thing that is important is that it's<br>been studied using very different<br>synonyms so actually it's hard sometimes<br>for people to join up all of these<br>observations I think this is often a<br>problem in behavior that people are<br>studying more similar things but if you<br>just call it slightly different things<br>then then people might not<br>notice it's a real problem with phenomic<br>plasticity I studied phenic plasticity<br>in terms of sex allocation but we<br>literally never use that term it's so<br>obviously pH toic plastic and then<br>people go ah we've not studied<br>fenity<br>anyway so um reprodu interference in in<br>liade so um the species we study we've<br>got five species of liade in the lab<br>like guess a questionus it's very<br>closely related sister species they've<br>only been separated about 40 years by<br>taxonomist like cretus SP panurus they<br>all um basically overlaping in as in<br>parapat to some extent in Europe on<br>compel as dozen it's American species<br>but we have it as well and even in<br>Europe there are other like AES um that<br>that share habitat so these these<br>species will be on the whole interacting<br>with each<br>other so one of the first things we did<br>um or Emily did was just look at<br>reproductive interference in the wild<br>and this is literally plucking adults<br>off allander bushes putting them in pet<br>dishes in situ that's a happy looking<br>PhD St If Ever I Saw um and just waiting<br>looking to see whether or not they<br>remate<br>if you take lius crus females uh and<br>males and pair them up about 50% of<br>those trials Le to am mounting and about<br>28% would lead to a populat temp<br>population but even if you took like as<br>critical females and spent as males<br>they're all on the same bushes hanging<br>around together 72% of the spted to M<br>female and there were<br>16% actual proper of population TS and<br>this is literally just plucking animals<br>off the bushes so this is a real thing<br>that's going on they are poent you know<br>they're attempting to make spthe is<br>attempting to make with the wrong<br>species heavly looking a bit happier in<br>the lab and and here's a study where<br>don't really worry too much about all<br>the details but again we had two<br>populations of L sequesters<br>we pandur<br>and and the and the red um uh boxes just<br>show you reproductive interference and<br>basically about 10% of herings involved<br>a population atts which to me again<br>seems like quite a lot this is not that<br>unusual or strange a<br>behavior and just for completeness these<br>inter specific mating interactions could<br>be Hosley here's a classic sort of<br>mating a survival experiment you got a<br>number of days in the treatment on<br>x-axis ctive survival<br>on the Y AIS so you have these these two<br>lines of female lqu kept by themselves<br>or in the purple with onco fattis males<br>that has no effect on Survival but if<br>you're kept with a conspecific male or<br>indeed with a male<br>spur are well understood costs of<br>maintain costs of harass so a male sper<br>status can be as damaging to a female as<br>a male like a sequesters<br>and in terms of fund again we see fund<br>costs being associated with basing with<br>heteros specific or having heteros<br>specifics around trying to make with<br>population so this sort of work started<br>to get me interested you know back into<br>sexual selection<br>my PhD so what about sexual selection<br>like a bugs as a as a model non-model<br>system well both males and females make<br>multiply there's little sexual<br>dimorphism I mean they're not right um<br>females are larger than males they size<br>morphism the leg allometries are<br>slightly different males have slightly<br>longer legs for their size cuticular<br>hydrocarbon profiles do vary but<br>generally they know they look pretty<br>similar limited courtship generally<br>looks like opportunistic Mak<br>opportunities uh in the<br>wild we have this reproduct interference<br>so we perhaps have rather limited preon<br>make choice and if you wrote all of that<br>in a grant and then said I want to study<br>sexual selection in that species the<br>reviewers would probably go well why you<br>on so that's what did that's what we've<br>been doing we've been studying it anyway<br>so let's focus on precopulatory SE of<br>selection but primarily I'm going to<br>focus on work on<br>lies Li simulan I'm going to be a bit<br>cheeky and kind of um put those<br>different studies pretty much together<br>the stories are very similar from the<br>two species um and they are very<br>similar so precopulatory sexual<br>selection from a bunch of studies there<br>are two main results of pre not<br>selection in these species the first one<br>is variable and and<br>inconsistent selection on male side so<br>across a range of studies sometimes you<br>see that larger males have high<br>population success sometimes you don't<br>and sometimes you start to see<br>potentially even what looks like<br>stabilized stion so sometimes larger<br>males more likely to pair up success<br>with the female sometimes not and from<br>our initial seual conflict work this was<br>the sort of thing I was you know I<br>expecting to see this you know there's<br>not there's some struggling so I was<br>thinking that maybe in a larger male<br>more consistent better able to make um<br>but not a particularly consistent<br>pattern there is more consistent<br>although it's not always it doesn't<br>occur in every study but there's more<br>consistent preop sexual selection on<br>female body size so again across studies<br>we see that larger females are more<br>likely to culated in the M trial and we<br>can do it different ways in this<br>experiment for different reason we have<br>large and small size groups again the<br>large females were more likely to<br>calculate than the small females these<br>experiments also messing around with<br>male sides as<br>well so those are really what we see in<br>selection that's just in the lab so this<br>is where festo the C back so um ailia<br>fris who started her PhD with me this<br>after year um in the field collecting<br>bugs spens pandur so one of our other<br>species and we've only been back six<br>seven weeks she hasn't properly analyzed<br>at because we literally have adopted<br>that cab has it turned up like emaciated<br>skinny we fed it um we were like going<br>well looking up I mean there's loads of<br>straight hats in this<br>um it's long story short the feeling I<br>ended up driving across the island to<br>poo two days before we flew out to leave<br>it with an English couple P out getting<br>it snck and mic chips for and it is now<br>safely back at Scotland had a happy<br>ending it is now uh safely in Scotland<br>with ailia and her partner John so the<br>data are not fully analyzed and it's my<br>fault for being a soft supervisor<br>basically anyway<br>all on my side now nothing else so in<br>terms of non-random mating if you just<br>collect the pairs that are mating in the<br>field versus unpaired individuals and<br>look at the size differences between<br>paired and unpaired individuals or if<br>you take um individuals that are up that<br>weren't mating in the field but probably<br>not necessar virgin do mate trials in<br>both cases you see that again data<br>labels are being small longer females<br>and wider females wider ABD were more<br>likely to M than not so again we're<br>seeing make choice for larger females in<br>the world there's some hint of<br>stabilizing selection but um we need to<br>wait for a festo to settle down and<br>we'll get that sorted<br>out so generally in our bugs it's<br>looking that we're seeing precopulatory<br>sexual selection being dominated by male<br>map Choice the larger and females and<br>you know this is sort of pattern we're<br>starting to see a bit more in insects me<br>do the out's review is they 20 years old<br>now and we are seeing more and more male<br>make<br>choice and with that I want to sort of<br>take a little step to one side and think<br>about bitman<br>gradiance so if any of you are not say<br>sort of sexual selection of fardos what<br>a bitman gradient is is the slope of the<br>line uh of the relationship between how<br>many matings you have and your<br>reproductive success<br>so if you have lots of matings do you<br>have a lot of reproductive success or do<br>you have not so much do it not increase<br>very much and the classic pattern is<br>that males increase their Fitness more<br>rapidly with every mating they get<br>whereas females don't tend to so the<br>females might have a flat gradient or a<br>weakly sloping one and the males<br>SE and indeed team Jan and colleagues in<br>a very important paper uh in 2016 course<br>the whole Animal Kingdom you here this<br>is the difference between male and<br>female bement gradients over here is<br>where the male bement gradient is<br>steeper than the female one generally<br>male bement gradients are Seer than<br>female bement<br>gradients so the empirical data does<br>indeed show that the majority of species<br>exhibit kind of traditional or normative<br>bit G so the male bait gradient is<br>steeper than the female B gradient so<br>males get greater benefit the more time<br>they made<br>females now evidence and indeed<br>arguments about this about normative<br>sexs suggesting you know bitman<br>gradients lead to these typical sex<br>roles so females being more choicy and<br>males being more directly competitive<br>for mes but how does this fit with<br>growing evidence of male Matrix as as<br>seen in my bugs and other species<br>doesn't these B rades may be like this<br>but we are seeing cheesy mes which is<br>not really the traditional sort of um<br>default<br>expectation and we haven't published<br>this yet but we have estimated bement<br>gradients in L simulans the blue line is<br>the um male bement gradient the red line<br>is female one and we do see the<br>traditional difference male bement<br>gradients are SE than female ones and<br>yet despite that pattern we we do you<br>see a predominance of male M Choice<br>rather than females being<br>Cho and and I think you know there's<br>well there is a critique to be written<br>because Ellie gurovich and I are doing<br>it um you know that the trouble with B<br>MC great is it doesn't really predict<br>fine sale behaviors very much you can<br>get choosing males even if the batement<br>gradients are like<br>this okay so that's preal sexual<br>selection let's move on to<br>postcopulatory sexual selection so the<br>competition for gametes during and after<br>mating and here's another curious set of<br>episodes and mon a more non-model<br>species entertainment so again here are<br>five species of like a that we have in<br>the<br>lab and what um Jenny Greenway found in<br>her PhD is that mating failure is common<br>in these species now mating failure can<br>arise in a whole range of ways from just<br>you failing to find a mate at all in<br>your life through to finding mates but<br>there's no successful Offspring<br>production and in particular in our bugs<br>what we're seeing is across tons of<br>experiments and not just in our lab 40<br>to 60% of pairings which are long enough<br>for the males to properly deploy Genia<br>andly there's no successful sperm<br>transer and no we call that cryptic<br>mating failure you can't kind of see it<br>you think there's been a culation you<br>think it should all be fine uh in actual<br>fact you don't get Offspring and here<br>just some data again<br>the the the labels match up to this<br>order just basically these are uh<br>individuals we had Offspring produced<br>infertile eggs with no eggs at all and<br>again it's that kind of 50<br>now mainting failure is likely to be an<br>understudied phenotype I remember<br>reading Bard's cryptic female Choice<br>book as as a post as a grad student and<br>you know in that he has kind of throwa<br>away comments that yeah this probably<br>happens a lot but you know when you're<br>do an experiment and females don't<br>produce Offspring or don't make you just<br>sort of throw them away you know ignore<br>her so potentially this this kind of<br>trait has been ignored<br>and and things like either sperm<br>depletion or or stuff like that may<br>poten be way more common uh than we<br>realize so one of the next things that<br>that jinny did in her PhD was looking to<br>see whether or not mating failure in<br>like s was was a was a real phenotype or<br>just a kind ofal thing that happens more<br>than we might exp but it's just so an<br>accident so we thought would look at the<br>repeatability mating failure very simple<br>experiment take males you make them one<br>day after another to to a female they<br>get to layex or not produce Offspring or<br>families and what she showed is that<br>bating failure is quite repeatable at<br>the individual level so some males were<br>more likely to exhibit amazing failure<br>uh than others the family level<br>repeatability is low and not significant<br>there are only 14 families but this<br>would actually this difference here<br>would suggest that this mostly<br>environmental rather genetic so about<br>how the the male condition is and<br>whether or not he is able to um pass fir<br>or wants to pass fir to females and<br>again about 50% of matings produce no<br>Offspring and about 25% of males CH not<br>to produce Offspring at all didn't<br>produce Offspring at<br>all so our interpretation back in 2015<br>was that some males were more prone to M<br>and Fa than others which is what the<br>repeatability estimate says but we were<br>very much interpreting that in terms of<br>critically so there was some males that<br>females just didn't like and just didn't<br>allow them or allow them to transfer<br>let's say they stopped males<br>and mating failure really is the key<br>reproductive outcome for thinking about<br>exploring postc sex slection in this<br>species and in this whole little group<br>and so the key question is what causes<br>cryptic mating<br>failure and you know you guys can have<br>your ideas as well I'm sure there'll be<br>these sorts of things there can be<br>mechanical incompatibilities or<br>incompetence so I'll show you the male<br>genitalia in a minute it's reasonably<br>complicated the male have unfur it<br>inside the female maybe that's hard to<br>do and males AR be good at it even<br>though we would expect strong selection<br>on that kind of primary social function<br>there might be genetic<br>incompatibility between males and<br>females there might be CTIC female<br>Choice as I've just talked about or<br>indeed there might be cryptic male<br>choice that males despite having paired<br>up with a female Eng genitalia then<br>toate haven't got time to um convince<br>you that those two aren't happening with<br>data but um experiment suggests it's not<br>down to those two things so what about<br>cryptic female choice and cryptic male<br>Choice well to start off let's talk<br>about the the sort of the first form of<br>postp SE that people take<br>this is Vicky balur who's a PhD student<br>in my lab and we did sperm competition<br>experiments where we have wild type Li<br>simulans made to other other wild types<br>or pales so the pale mutation segregates<br>the single menian Locus it's recessive<br>uh and it's nice for doing um sperm<br>competition<br>experiments now the sort of first thing<br>to notice is that mating failure is<br>really important for interpreting sperm<br>competition studies as Papa Garcia<br>Gonzalez shown a really beautiful paper<br>in 2004 and now that you know you need<br>to take into account when you're<br>studying Sperma competition whether both<br>males or however many males you're<br>looking at actually inseminated<br>female and with mating failure if you<br>include situations where only one male<br>probably F ulated so this is P2 this is<br>the portion of eggs fertilized by the<br>second M mate two males to<br>mate if Peter is n this suggests that<br>only the first male inseminated if P2 is<br>one that suggests only the second male<br>inseminated this is what you see just<br>straight off if you take away those<br>individuals you get basically a uniform<br>pattern of second male prees and you<br>know what Paco his his simulations is<br>paper almost look identical say the sort<br>of simulations is what you get and looks<br>very similar to<br>that<br>importantly um although this is a<br>uniform distribution it's not a random<br>process culation duration strongly<br>correlates with ma F in so we've got<br>culation duration long here and<br>culations can be very long they can be<br>many hours in fact we often don't let<br>them go that long and the prob of mating<br>failure deine so once you've been mating<br>for 3 hours<br>also you're highly likely to be<br>receiving sperm we've done this we we<br>believe in replicability in our lab so<br>we've done that multiple times in<br>different experiments and you basically<br>see the same thing so population<br>duration is very important for mating<br>failure and it's also very important for<br>precedence for alterity so we got here<br>the difference in mating duration day<br>one minus day two so over here where<br>it's positive this is where the first<br>male to mate on a 1 calculates for<br>longer than the second male and you see<br>that the paternity is very low P2 so<br>very high P1 so the first male gets all<br>the eternity over here is negativ this<br>is where the male on day two calculates<br>longer and that male fertilizes much<br>many more of the eggs and again we've<br>done that more than<br>once so these data suggest random sperm<br>mixing and correlation up to a point<br>between population duration and sperm<br>transfer so the more the longer you<br>populate the more sperm you transfer and<br>the more likely you are to ferti<br>outs and male investment in a population<br>success promise I'd show you the<br>genitalia and this is work from doy<br>because of student in my lab and those<br>drawing so the males have this endus<br>area and then this long processus that<br>what has to do winds around inside the<br>female's ver Matrix and up the spal duct<br>to the spera so here's just under a<br>microscope this is X CT in here we have<br>the end of the processes we have this<br>little cork screw thing which you might<br>not see too much and then slightly<br>sclerotized sper so the male has to<br>thread the processus through the female<br>uh to get<br>there why the long organ well what's<br>interesting is that in a bunch of<br>experiments that Liam did and also uh<br>Andre tler a few years before and there<br>is stabilizing selection on igus L so<br>basically fertilization success a pece<br>of this sort of intermediate long um<br>processes length but if you have it<br>really long then you actually your<br>fertilization success starts to go down<br>so there does appear to be selection on<br>male gen SL and having not too long a<br>gen processors appears to be<br>optimal Liam did some really nice<br>manipulation experiments because you can<br>get this processors out you can tease it<br>out snip bits off um and if you you know<br>reduce the processors by4 a millimeters<br>not 7 mm long it's know more than half<br>the length of the ACT insect c um<br>you can reduce Offspring production so<br>you reduce vertiz success if you s off<br>bits at the<br>end what's kind of cute is I really like<br>is that from these individuals where you<br>snipped off the point before you lose<br>that stabilizing selection patter now<br>it's just like it's good the long you<br>possi are as good you can't be that long<br>anymore um so clearly the length of the<br>male processes um is important<br>so now let's move to cryptic matate<br>Choice thinking about males females<br>males and a whole range of experiments<br>that VI had done when you get matings<br>when you look at whether or not sperm is<br>transferred or not the most consistent<br>pattern the most consistent pattern we<br>see in any of these sex lecture studies<br>is that larger females are more likely<br>to produce lymphs and receive sperm and<br>here's three different experiments again<br>we have large females versus small<br>females and the proportion of pairs that<br>produce Offspring we have two<br>experiments looking at body length and<br>mating failure and again mating failure<br>is much higher to smaller individuals<br>compared to bigger inds so larger<br>females are more likely to receive sperm<br>um and jinny Greenway did work to show<br>that it is or primarily about sperm<br>being<br>answer now phenotypically what we see<br>looks like cryptic male Choice it looks<br>as though males are preferring to<br>inseminate large moroc females but of<br>course you know it could be that larger<br>females need more sperm prefer to<br>receive more sperm or have you and you<br>know we have we know we need to do<br>experiments to try and separate that<br>the repeatability work I talked about<br>would suggest that some males are more<br>choosy or more prepared to invest in<br>female others but and this is something<br>reviewers ask so why would you bother<br>mating why would you bother pairing up<br>and potentially pairing up for two hours<br>and not<br>in um as I said the other day to<br>everyone response we don't know we want<br>to know why that is but um and I say<br>maybe larger females just want more<br>sperm so a rather quizzical looking<br>Maddie ABS who is now working on C<br>cannibalism but as an undergraduate did<br>some work on this um we came up with two<br>experiments to manipulate how males<br>might value a female of a given size try<br>and change that but in a way that the<br>female doesn't know so the female is<br>kept away and we try and change how a<br>male might want to mate with or how how<br>much they might want to disseminate a<br>given<br>female the first experiment very kind of<br>classic experiment that people do is we<br>had males in groups and that were not<br>and then we gave them the opp mate<br>thinking that if you've been in a group<br>of males you might think there's a lot<br>of competition therefore you may be more<br>likely to want to make the minute you<br>find a<br>female alternatively we did sort of the<br>opposite thing where we gave males PR<br>experience of females or not and again<br>if you've had lots of females around may<br>be more picking the next time you do<br>encounter a female you only make a<br>really big something like<br>that but MADD is looking quizzical<br>because in these two experiments and<br>decent size experiments only we only got<br>rather limited and marginally un<br>significant effects of treatment on<br>female preferences on male preferences<br>so we couldn't successfully show we<br>still showed that larg Ms with more lik<br>receiv sperm but there was no treatment<br>interaction so we couldn't say it's<br>definitely down to something that happen<br>to<br>the I want to talk about and this this<br>work in detail just really give you the<br>um stor so we did experiments where<br>doing sperm competition and make choice<br>manipulations at the same<br>time and basically outcomes of sperm<br>competition and csy made Choice as sort<br>of already shown really linked by<br>population duration but we don't see an<br>independent effect of female size<br>independently in population duration so<br>it appears that population duration<br>which is related to female size leads to<br>the presence or absence of mating<br>failure and leads toity ARS we see so<br>population duration really seems to be<br>the crucial thing and that's what we<br>really need to try and get at um<br>mechanistically in more detail I think<br>so stepping<br>back the benefits of non-modal organisms<br>so we haven't worked under sof we worked<br>on a weird bug that is SE Doric very<br>much but the benefits are we end up<br>coming across F atts like reproductive<br>interference and mating failure things<br>that we shouldn't really expect to see<br>we expect species not to make the non<br>species we expect species to generally<br>be quite good at passing sperm you know<br>if you go to whis B you should generally<br>be quite it both natural and sexual<br>selection should favor that kind of<br>function and yet that's not always true<br>and so you end up then asking questions<br>like well what is a copulation or what<br>is a copulation for is it really sex are<br>they getting together for other reasons<br>I mean we can talk about that in the<br>questions or at lunch but um you know is<br>a culation actually about sex after<br>all and thirdly we're getting you know<br>get and I've had to change the way I<br>think about things is that male nature<br>is going to be a really key component of<br>sexual<br>selection much more than we<br>thought of course the costs of working<br>on nonmodel species is you come across<br>pH hpes like this that we don't<br>understand and so then you know you have<br>to try and work out what's going on and<br>people are going yeah well it doesn't<br>happen<br>just<br>um you know the work I'm talking about<br>started in the mid 2000s with that St I<br>was a post office Su West on wasps got a<br>little bit of money blah Fellowship<br>slowly it's Tak us a long time to really<br>be asking the right questions I when you<br>do start working on on new species you<br>know you hav't have an idea that this is<br>going to be important or that is going<br>to be important but that may not be true<br>and you may end up finding yourself in a<br>rather different place and while that<br>has benefits it also has costs and<br>there's also the problem of building<br>interest in the communi like well how<br>important is reproduced fence really you<br>know who cares um and you got to try and<br>persuade people that these things are<br>perhaps more common than you think of<br>course certain people in this room uh<br>have managed to study um non-modal<br>systems but just really cool animals<br>right so they're just super super<br>charismatic so you know you're fine um<br>so going funky is is is one solution to<br>that problem I<br>think okay<br>summarize likees and mating systems and<br>mating system parameter SPAC say there's<br>limited pre copulatory choice we see<br>reproductive interference I haven't<br>talked about it today but we also see<br>same seex sexual behavior in these guys<br>so the classic exam you know explanation<br>from our usual thinking about mating<br>systems is that mates must be limiting<br>so you try to mate with all sorts of<br>things beer bottles or what have you<br>just to make sure you don't miss mating<br>opportunities that would be our classic<br>inference and kind of the classic<br>explanation for same sex sexual behavior<br>uh as<br>well we see these complex long genitalia<br>and evidence of stabilizing selection on<br>male genitalia so that suggests that<br>there's some cryptic female Choice<br>doesn't have to be a conscious choice of<br>course but the the morphology and the<br>size and structure of the female<br>reproduc tra seems to select uh on male<br>genitalia length to some extent that's<br>kind<br>of standard<br>thinking but we see this mating failure<br>and we see males not in inseminating not<br>inseminating despite long populations<br>and the inference there would be that<br>mates are not limiting you can pair up<br>and then still choose not um to actually<br>bother exina so this really is in<br>Conflict I think with with number<br>one we see this cryptic male make choice<br>for large females and what that<br>suggester to me is that actually male<br>fitness is much more limited by female<br>City is by finding M females to make so<br>the classic idea of bit gradients is<br>it's all about the number of females you<br>made with whereas this sort of data I<br>think suggests that a female te may have<br>a much bigger influence on male fitness<br>think yet our bitman gradients look<br>traditional so what do we infer from<br>that well don't tell Tim J yet um but<br>perhaps we should give up on bait<br>gradius what are they really telling us<br>about sexual<br>selection so we have these long lived<br>species they they live for several weeks<br>and the autum generation in in Europe<br>over Winters as adult and they mate<br>again in the spring uh so they're not<br>insects that live for two or three days<br>they're quite long lived they have many<br>mating opportunities therefore making<br>the odds you know mating with the wrong<br>species is not necessarily going to be<br>that costly there be plenty of other<br>opportunities and male fitness is not<br>about mating to say but about finding<br>for<br>females and as I was sort of thinking<br>about this in recent days I'm a bit of a<br>Darwin geek I love reading Darwin and<br>and all the rest of it and if you if<br>you've read The Descent of Man and you<br>into sexual selection you should do um<br>he ties himself up in knots comparing<br>human sexual selection and basically<br>everything else you know everything else<br>females choose e males are competitive<br>but in humans in Victorian society<br>anyway the females all showing or rest<br>and males choosing and he's desperately<br>trying to talk you know it's his<br>normally impeccable logic gets a bit<br>fluffy but actually know this is the<br>human situation we're long lived lots of<br>mating opportunities and actually<br>finding fertile stroke become females is<br>you know a really important aspect for<br>male reproductive success but it means<br>you don't necessarily have a traditional<br>looking mating system and with that I'll<br>with a sunset view from this is our<br>Villa in Sicily Mount etner is behind us<br>here this is looking out across Sicily<br>and if any of you want to come and Chase<br>you<br>gosh I previous this by saying I'm not a<br>biologist um<br>second uh but kind of connecting some of<br>the things that you were saying um would<br>damage to the to the individual complex<br>sexual<br>organs um due to the fact that they're<br>meeting with different species be a<br>potential kind of um component to the<br>that individual not<br>transferring um sperm during during the<br>actual interactions with their own Spees<br>well answer that in the Contex of<br>actually damage when you're Ming same<br>species so Le did a kind of fun<br>experiment where when when we looked at<br>the processors in detail you actually<br>see the end has a little little kind of<br>cup structure um so you can actually<br>tell what the end of the processor<br>should look like and then um because he<br>was just one of those good students he<br>noticed that some males don't have that<br>so it looks like there has been some<br>breakage so what we did was just put<br>males and females together for varying<br>numbers of days in just let them make<br>how much they want and after seven days<br>about 15 to 20% of males lost that car<br>so they are losing the end of their e<br>sapping off um when J did had tons of<br>dissections you only found one case<br>where you could see a bit of male igus<br>trapped inside the female reprodu tra so<br>potentially the males do have to tuck<br>themselves back in after the population<br>and uh if they fail to do that properly<br>maybe bits gets s up and so on so there<br>certainly is that cost of mating<br>repeatedly for males that they do suffer<br>that damage and given his um Liam's<br>experimental snippings that will have<br>cost you know if you lose too much you e<br>because you're less successful<br>fertilized females in terms of within<br>between species stuff simulans and<br>equestri just can make with each other<br>very happily and they seem to they make<br>can<br>they F in One Direction across that's<br>kind of speciation<br>biy we see genal pairings in other<br>combinations but we have much less idea<br>about how successful the deployment need<br>so the question is is mating failure a<br>plastic response is stronger in some<br>populations than others uh should it be<br>weaker in populations that have strong<br>male sexual selection that's a super<br>question Frank and um uh we don't know<br>so we had PhD student a long time ago<br>now looking at different patterns of<br>sexual conflict and we and we saw that<br>there were different costs and benefits<br>of mating um and it may be that the<br>benefit of a female is that for mating<br>repeatedly is that you're more likely to<br>actually receive sperm because males are<br>more likely to end up fertilizing<br>disseminating you um and there's some<br>variation amongst population so it may<br>well be the case that some populations<br>mating failure uh is is is not so common<br>um one of the things we and sort<br>touching a little bit on on this<br>question um and again with the the<br>experiments that that Maddy was involved<br>in um we we tried to manipulate um male<br>and female mating<br>experience um to see whether or not we<br>see different patterns of subsequent<br>matings and we and as we as I've shown<br>here we don't tend to see very much<br>which is unusual again in dropil if you<br>keep males in bigger groups they<br>populate for longer they do all of this<br>sort of stuff that they that doesn't<br>happen here if if you have three males<br>together with a female the male that<br>does mate will copulate for longer like<br>he's guarding the female but if the<br>female's not there and then you just put<br>a male separately with a female he<br>treats the female as if this is it this<br>is the only thing that matters um they<br>don't pay attention to previous<br>experience so um so in that response uh<br>in that regard to your your question<br>frame I would it may well be that it's<br>not necessarily that plastic in terms of<br>the sort of ecological conditions or<br>population variation it really comes<br>down to what the female is like that the<br>male has in front of them and they just<br>seem to want to pass sperm to larger<br>females that seems to be the key thing<br>but we would love to manipulate that<br>more and get at some of these mechanisms<br>but that appears to be the key thing you<br>think there must be sp there surely even<br>if you're up against a bit of a sh you<br>there just transer but still to at least<br>try some of that every I I think you<br>know<br>fundamentally I think sperm it's not I<br>mean we know that sperm are more costly<br>than than totally infinitely cheap you<br>know Nell and M Gage and Jet par that<br>had their tree paper you know 20 years<br>ago now reminding us of that point but I<br>still think we all tend to think that<br>they're still cheap enough that you<br>should you know throw throw your hat in<br>the ring if nothing else such um I just<br>beginning to think that that's not<br>necessarily true um and you know these<br>guys mate a lot they they're geared up<br>for mating a lot males will try and Mak<br>it a lot you know they'll make it every<br>day um but that's but they're more<br>careful with their sperm than that that<br>that apparent mating pattern would would<br>suggest um and and I just think males<br>are more because now get generalize to<br>everything this is what we all do um is<br>that you know something like these bugs<br>will will War us that um you know males<br>may be more careful with their sperm<br>than than we think because what's really<br>curious is that we don't<br>see yeah as you say one up p f we don't<br>see females who just produce a few<br>Offspring like 10 or 20 we we see either<br>a usual amount of Offspring so we let<br>them lay extra 10 we nor let them legs<br>for seven days and then see what turns<br>into NS you know we'll get 50 60<br>offspring blah blah we rarely get one or<br>two or three um it really is kind of All<br>or Nothing To to a very large extent um<br>and so that doesn't doesn't suggest that<br>there's they're just putting a tiny tiny<br>amount of sperm in<br>so the CB flies I worked<br>on I know Greg has done some work on CB<br>flies in New Zealand Greg hell um SE<br>flies make like heck they absolutely<br>make a load and males just enough sperm<br>to fertilize the last clutch or a clutch<br>F on the off chance that they are the<br>last male and and if they're not the<br>last male and they lose out in sperm<br>competition they haven't wasted any<br>sperm so you can basically get a female<br>that makes the male and she will falize<br>a cut of 30 eggs but no more um we did<br>rather a student before me found a bunch<br>of males that repeatedly put in even<br>tinier amounts it basically only<br>fertiliz a third of a plch we we call<br>the c m<br>and so that's why you they're to they're<br>going to make with a lot so they're only<br>going to put a few in and and you know<br>I'd love to actually go back and try to<br>ReDiscover those that theena type and do<br>the modeling as to what what is the<br>benefit of not even properly competing<br>in sperm competition but just going a<br>few a few few so yeah I think there's<br>there's much more of that going on than<br>we normally think and and you know what<br>years ago talk Tim who's like that we're<br>missing something about polyandry why do<br>females made so much and I think that's<br>what we're missing I think that males<br>are more careful with their sperm and so<br>it may not even be that their sperm<br>depleted but they're going you know what<br>I'm just actually not going to maybe I'm<br>not yes there is something fertility<br>insurance as one of the hypotheses for<br>but it's probably<br>not yeah I think we kind of and even<br>sort of fertility Assurance has this<br>sort of interesting connotation rather<br>being one more question um yeah thanks I<br>was just kind of curious to hear your<br>opinion what like so I mean these males<br>are investing a lot into these really<br>long populations and that's<br>energetically costly I know you said you<br>don't know why but I'm just curious to<br>think toar here why you think they might<br>be doing this what's your sort of gut<br>feeling I think my gut feeling is<br>that getting catching females at the<br>right window is is important and so um<br>if you you've got a female she's got<br>Reas mature eggs ready she's got a lot<br>of them that's really worth investing in<br>um and maybe you can only find I haven't<br>talked about this but I should do um you<br>know maybe that you only find out the<br>status of egg development and things<br>like that when you're in culate and it<br>might be that I mean we focus on the<br>processors but you've got this big Endo<br>phalus which is going into the vers<br>copul and maybe that you know and the<br>ovaries are resting on the top and you<br>when a female is full of EX there's a<br>lot of pressure there and maybe they can<br>sense just how full of egg so abdomen<br>width is a good correlate overall size<br>is a good correlate over lifetime for c<br>not immediate egg<br>production and so maybe males get a lot<br>of information actually once their the<br>genital you're actually properly uh<br>engaged uh it takes about 30 minutes<br>before they do start disseminating if<br>they're going to um and and you know<br>maybe there's all of that time is is<br>also what is this female actually you<br>know really like so it could be that um<br>a more crazy idea um is they're<br>aposematic and we know that aposematic<br>species tend to Cluster the nymphs<br>cluster together when ourand Bush get<br>both species ni both species living<br>together sting<br>together wondering around<br>um um TR thought just um oh yeah so<br>maybe there actually being back to back<br>is quite good at doubling your signals<br>predators that your toxic now think that<br>would be a reason so I want to move to<br>that Bush come on girl join up and we I<br>don't think that's what's going on but<br>it but it may be at least the cost of<br>mating in terms of predation is much<br>lower in this kind of species because<br>you're increasing apostatic signal<br>you're this bigger black and red thing<br>that birds have learned is toxic and so<br>they're less likely to beated but I I<br>don't think that's what's going on but<br>um know users well maybe it's not sex if<br>it's not sex what is it is it like being<br>together is safer I don't it just see it<br>seems costly to me<br>but kind of makes me interested if<br>anyone's everever looked at whether or<br>not length of calculations is correlated<br>with like atic<br>coloration yeah I don't no I don't think<br>anyone well I mean people have talked a<br>bit about and if you know aitis se s<br>more because in some ways cute trade up<br>right you want to signal that you're<br>horrible to a predator but signal that<br>you're lovely to a mate and so there's<br>they're interesting how these signals<br>may may not cross talk with each other<br>Emily bir soon has got a Rel ship in<br>Amsterdam now we are collaborating a bit<br>to try and look at toxicity color cutic<br>hydrocarbons which is more her thing and<br>and then mating success to see how they<br>toxicity and color and stuff May trade<br>off against each other people have<br>talked about there still not many<br>studies looking at that um but yeah more<br>generally do acmatics do are they more<br>Brazen do they not<br>care things like<br>that crazy questions but we will wrap up<br>in case someone else is coming in
