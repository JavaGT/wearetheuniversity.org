Interfaces are spaces where different systems meet and interact with one another. Highspeed videography was used to study the transport of microbes across the air-plant interface and the air-water interface. Microscopic tornadoes during rain events liberated spores from infected leaf surfaces. Sneezing plants expelled spores via jumping droplet condensation. Ice-nucleating bacteria were aerosolized from water in wind-driven spume droplets. Aerial and aquatic robots were deployed in the USA, Europe, and New Zealand to understand the transport and spread of fluorescent dyes and toxic cyanobacteria across the air-water interface. Air sampling devices onboard drones were used to track the movement of plant pathogens from infected fields, collect pollen from genetically-engineered crops, and characterize plumes of coloured smoke. New research aims to investigate how microbes at ice-air-water interfaces are released during melting and cracking. Our work has important implications for plant pandemic preparedness, food security, and public safety.<br><br>Biography: Dr. David Schmale is a Professor and the Director of the Translational Plant Sciences Center at Virginia Tech.

for<br>this ER seminar um it's an absolute<br>pleasure to reintroduce David uh to you<br>guys uh David uh is visiting us this<br>week uh on his journey through New<br>Zealand connecting with researchers and<br>a collaborative project so hopefully we<br>hear a little bit about this today um<br>I'll let David introduce a little bit<br>more about himself actually but um David<br>and I met uh when you were on your<br>sabatical here as a full bright scholar<br>in 2020 um and mon during Co lockdown um<br>when we just shared some stories around<br>about that time earlier this morning uh<br>David and I connected through some of<br>the legs research that we're doing here<br>um and the drown work that David has<br>been involved in in terms of using<br>drones to study legs and collect samples<br>from those legs that was really exciting<br>experience um David you left a really<br>lasting impression on the group really<br>with your enthusiasm and positive<br>attitude towards all these projects and<br>we're really grateful that you came came<br>back to visit us and we can't wait to<br>hear what you have been up to in the<br>last few years so thanks David for<br>coming along all right appreciate that<br>thank you Dennis it's great to be back<br>um and uh so yeah I left New Zealand a<br>little over three years ago um the 15th<br>of June 2021 and I'll tell you a little<br>bit about the Journey of my time in New<br>Zealand of course um the the science<br>that uh we've been doing both at<br>Virginia Tech and then while we're here<br>in in New Zealand as well so hopefully<br>this will advance I'll mention right off<br>the bat i' like to throw uh the um sort<br>of acknowledgements at the beginning of<br>my presentation so um this is uh my lab<br>Group which is of course a big heart of<br>the operation back in blackburg Virginia<br>um we didn't get the the colors quite<br>right on the the plugin which is what we<br>were trying to sort out but those are<br>different colors of uh Little Smoke<br>emitters I'll tell you a little bit<br>about them later um as part of a tracer<br>that we're using to to track plumes of<br>things um we've been fun of course by<br>the National Science Foundation our<br>Prime sponsor in the United States<br>United States Department of Agriculture<br>Fullbright New Zealand which I'll tell<br>you more about today um we have a<br>project funded by NASA looking at<br>transport of African dust um itas at<br>Virginia Tech and then a center which I<br>now direct the translational plant<br>Sciences Center at VT I'll start by uh<br>um introducing uh former Senator<br>Fulbright from the great state of<br>Arkansas um it's his program his<br>International Exchange program that<br>actually brought me to New Zealand uh<br>for what was supposed to be six months<br>but ended up being a year and a half um<br>and uh former Senator Fulbright uh was<br>of course quoted as saying the essence<br>of Intercultural education is the<br>acquisition of empathy the ability to<br>see the world as others see it and to<br>allow the possibility that others may<br>not see something we have failed to see<br>and certainly um during the uh pandemic<br>and during post-pandemic years um that<br>statement is ever true so I'll tell you<br>a little bit about my journey uh first<br>to New Zealand um we landed in Christ<br>Church on the 1st of January 2020 um<br>this is of course me at the center my<br>wife was taking the picture of my two<br>daughters Nora and Vivian we spent the<br>uh the better part of the month on the<br>south island during what we thought at<br>the time was going to be our only<br>Journey to the South Island and then we<br>landed of course um in Hamilton a little<br>uh Cottage a grandmother's Cottage in<br>Tahiri um and we uh the my fbite<br>formally started February 1st of 2020<br>this is of course Fullbright<br>headquarters P Penelope Borland who's<br>still directing full Bright Now full<br>Bright New Zealand based in Willington<br>and then we quickly shuffled off to Mari<br>in Willington where we proceeded to<br>spend the night um this was uh quite an<br>experience uh for somebody like myself<br>and um I was actually uh quite smartly<br>in this bed on the end which was close<br>to the restom so um um all of the full<br>briers uh of course uh were there um and<br>members of the community and of course<br>Fullbright New Zealand and we spent the<br>better part of a day um having a variety<br>of queros right here talking with<br>members of the community and of course<br>this was a cultural Merion at its finest<br>for us um and then settled into our<br>block which is now Whitney's office of<br>course uh as she's enjoying and I was<br>back there in the corner and of course<br>all my equipment stacked up in here<br>shipped over all sorts of drones among<br>other things um and that was my home for<br>what was only supposed to be six months<br>but turned into a year and a half my two<br>girls of course were going to school at<br>the tamur model Country School and also<br>at Barkley for those of you that have<br>children or wear those schools um and<br>uniforms are a new thing for them um<br>that's not something we're used to in<br>the US and so of course uh um they they<br>all get it out for that uh March 2020<br>received a letter from then president<br>Trump said hey full bright program has<br>been uh cancelled worldwide come home um<br>if you don't come home we not be able to<br>get you back and so uh my fbite started<br>the 1 of uh of February and it ended<br>March 9th uh with a certificate of<br>completion um and go home um and so we<br>of course decided to stay um uh we<br>figured out that hey being on this<br>beautiful is of nation maybe wouldn't be<br>such a bad thing particularly given that<br>a science forward agenda was being<br>promoted by then what my kids called<br>anti jenda um versus what was happening<br>in the US with then president Trump of<br>course the 17th of March uh be strong<br>but be kind we will be okay words that<br>of course many of you remember for those<br>of you that were here um and of course<br>Ashley boomi this will require all<br>efforts strongly urge all new zealanders<br>to play their part and of course that uh<br>that concept messaging the team of 5<br>million and we were glad to be part of<br>that team of 5 million during the<br>pandemic of course you might recall<br>coming out of that seven-week lockdown<br>into this sort of phased level strategy<br>which was deployed and um changed as<br>cases sort of broke through the miq<br>system but ultimately um allowing us to<br>reemerge and do some rather um exciting<br>work um here's Brendan guess making sure<br>that the propulsion on the boat is uh<br>working brenon sitting here in the<br>office uh meritz who I understand is no<br>longer here of course doing uh doing a<br>bunch of sampling both with them but<br>also this incredible Lakes 380 team led<br>by Susie wood and Marcus um we had the<br>opportunity to get out to the cadams and<br>do a campaign out there uh campaigns<br>here in theato also down on the south<br>island and I'll share some videos of<br>this later on if we have time and so<br>this is Celeste who also worked here for<br>a short time at the University and she<br>was a wonderful technician that traveled<br>with me on many of these Adventures um<br>and this is Susie wood here and Marcus<br>as we're standing on the shore of one of<br>these incredible necklace Lakes uh<br>chattam Islands at Dune Lake um with the<br>ocean just on the other side of that FL<br>of course I also had the opportunity to<br>engage um with a number of ewe and and<br>Brendan took me over to Lake brua and<br>this is uh f f Mary actually using a a<br>little cyof Flor instrument Uh suie Wood<br>did just an incredible outreach program<br>with local communities one was at the um<br>the lake here in Hamilton um teaching<br>students of course about Lake ecology um<br>but also here's the cyan FL once again<br>students were collecting Lake samples<br>and Susie developed this beautiful sort<br>of red light green light yellow light<br>system as it pertains to cyan of<br>bacterial blooms in Lake health and so<br>being part of these efforts and and<br>being inspired by this uh Community<br>engagement was a big part of course of<br>of my time here in New Zealand and of<br>course we made uh friends for life uh<br>this is our fond Vicky Dave and the kids<br>we had many adventures with them uh<br>throughout our time here in New Zealand<br>and I just had dinner with them the<br>other night and of course everybody's<br>grown up quite a bit so that's quite a<br>bit of fun so often when you think<br>you're at the end of something you at<br>the beginning of something else uh that<br>was the late Fred Rogers um and it is so<br>true I'm here in New Zealand because of<br>a new project a new mbiu project um<br>actually funded uh to study um<br>essentially areial Invaders that can<br>come into New Zealand via long-distance<br>transport Pathways this project is led<br>by LC pretorius um we're having our<br>first team workshop meeting uh down on<br>the south island next week and so it was<br>originally slated for the North Island<br>uh inro toad actually but then it got<br>bumped to uh to Christ Church um so I<br>decided to come here to the North Island<br>to visit with aranu uh of course asked<br>Den if if there was an opportunity to<br>come here and talk and give a seminar<br>and he said yes and so I'm very excited<br>to tell you um a little bit more about<br>this project in the context of our work<br>but this is what's brought me back to<br>New Zealand and I'll be coming back for<br>the next five years as part of this<br>project what I'm really here to talk<br>about is interfaces and this will be a<br>common theme um throughout my talk today<br>interfaces are essentially where uh<br>spaces where different systems come<br>together and interact and the story<br>starts here as we think about a plant uh<br>and the atmosphere in an air plant<br>interface and of course here's a<br>dandelion and as the wind sweeps across<br>the surface of the dandelion of course<br>you have different systems different<br>things happening a lot of really<br>interesting biophysical systems as well<br>from the wind detaching these seeds to<br>the seeds being transported in the wind<br>uh of course to new locations of course<br>we have the air water interface as well<br>and emblematic of this is the beautiful<br>king fisher as it's diving through<br>through the air down into the water<br>going through that air into that water<br>interface of course grabbing a little<br>meal and now the challenging part is<br>getting back out of the water air and so<br>the processes and systems I'll be<br>describing today will be discussing the<br>systems in place at these interfaces<br>particular the airplant interface and<br>also the air water<br>interface and of course by studying uh<br>these spaces these interfaces we can<br>learn about the systems themselves and<br>how they're interacting with one another<br>and this is of course diversity um at at<br>the helm here if you will and so today<br>I'll tell you stories that take us to<br>the air plant interface my background<br>and my training is actually Plant<br>Pathology I've moved in uh to uh to<br>Water Systems largely because of my<br>interest in cyanobacterial blooms and<br>potential for aerosolization and<br>transport of those toxins and that<br>project that interest actually is what<br>brought me to New Zealand as part of my<br>full bright but my trainings um in Plant<br>Pathology the study of plant diseases<br>and so I'll tell you some of that<br>foundational work in some some<br>surprising new mechanisms um of Spore<br>release and transport and then I'll tell<br>you about our work of course uh at the<br>air water interface deploying all sorts<br>of different robots around the world<br>including here in New Zealand quite a<br>bit of work also over in Europe um as<br>well as um in the US so of course as uh<br>uh as many of you are acutely aware of<br>as a result of the um covid-19 pandemic<br>the atmosphere is teeming with<br>microscopic life forms um we of course<br>can appreciate that uh in terms of<br>airborne viruses but most people don't<br>think about plant pathogens as being<br>transported through the atmosphere but<br>many of them are of course you have one<br>cruising around here in New Zealand<br>Myrtle rust that many Of You' have<br>probably heard about um that is of<br>course transported through the<br>atmosphere and I'll be talking about<br>rusts today um one rust in particular uh<br>called wheat Leaf rust which has some<br>interesting parallels to Myrtle rust and<br>so you can be thinking about a little<br>bit about that when I'm talking about<br>that system um this is a field of<br>potatoes that's been decimated by a<br>fungus like organism an OM my called<br>phop pestan which actually caused the<br>Irish Potato Famine for those of you who<br>are familiar with that episode in<br>history um and of course we've we do<br>these experiments out at our research<br>Farm where we grow a healthy crop we<br>kill it with a pathogen and then we<br>study how that pathogen can be<br>transported through the atmosphere over<br>long distances and of course this<br>requires teams of biologists and<br>Engineers working together um as part of<br>this effort and I'd like to formally<br>introduce my colleague Dr Shane Ross he<br>and I have been working together uh for<br>uh nearly two decades now uh studying<br>this process of atmospheric transport we<br>had an annual review that highlights the<br>sort of Concepts um what we like to call<br>highways in the sky as pathogens can<br>start moving from a source maybe an<br>infested crop or residue move through<br>the atmosphere of course encounter all<br>sorts of things like uh UV light washed<br>out via rain ultimately landing at some<br>unknown destination for the pathogen<br>hopefully it's a new host a susceptible<br>host and then that cycle can continue um<br>and in this ual review We highlight the<br>different scales of transport and this<br>will be a focus of basically my talk<br>today the first half um as we consider<br>these interfaces the pathogen scale<br>literally being millimeters moving to<br>the scale of the farm um where you're<br>looking at maybe acres to the scale of<br>of course regions which in the United<br>States is emblematic of States we have<br>state boundaries State territories that<br>regulate movement around the US for<br>example at least on the ground but not<br>in the air and then we have the<br>Continental scale and I'll put all of<br>these scales within a framework<br>including New Zealand um during my<br>presentation today so we'll start with a<br>pathogen scale um again this is a scale<br>of millimeters and as we think about<br>pathogens like fungi we think about<br>spore producing structures in particular<br>um that can produce um of course<br>infectious spores that can move from one<br>location to the next enter wheat Leaf<br>rust and so this is a fungus called<br>penia trto it causes these beautiful<br>lesions uh these puls they look like<br>little mini blisters and they're filled<br>with sport these spores are called<br>urinous spores and these are reinfecting<br>so they can actually reinfect the host<br>so um from wheat back to wheat and of<br>course as these Pils rupture uh these<br>Sports can be transported um through the<br>atmosphere via rain splash among other<br>things um we embarked on a study to try<br>to understand um actually how these<br>spores were being transported uh via<br>rainsplash and rainfall um using a<br>high-speed video camera this is one of<br>my collaborator Sunny young at Cornell<br>University this video camera allows us<br>to record a million frames in a single<br>second so for those of you that played<br>around with slow-mo on your on your<br>iPhone your smartphone you can get maybe<br>300 frames in a single second imagine<br>taking that up to a million frames in a<br>single second you can start to observe<br>some really interesting phenomena I'll<br>show you some of those videos shortly<br>this is a raindrop generator and so here<br>a little droplet will fall out and it<br>will Target basically a leaf surface<br>bearing a pathogen and then we'll be<br>able to visualize the transport of those<br>spores with that high-speed video this<br>is Jonathan Breo mechanical engineer um<br>you'll hear more about him shortly and<br>hope gfy really uh the brains behind the<br>operation she's a technician that's been<br>with me for almost 15 years um working<br>in various aspects of our patology<br>systems so our former graduate student<br>um H Park Dr Park did some really<br>elegant work uh here you're looking at a<br>surface of a wheat Leaf okay and the<br>little brown um Rusty looking colored<br>things are those urenia those Pils<br>bearing spores you're going to see a<br>droplet fall right down to the center of<br>the frame and this this video play a<br>couple times it's pretty cool the<br>droplet's going to fall it's going to<br>impact uh the surface of that weed leaf<br>and you're going to see satellite<br>droplets that droplet will burst into a<br>bunch of little droplets and you'll see<br>the spores the spores will be on the<br>outside of the droplet okay here it<br>comes boom okay you see the splashing<br>all out on the side and of course you<br>can see uh at the center look at these<br>droplets you can see the spores okay<br>they're hydrophobic they're on the<br>outside of the droplet um but something<br>that was quite surprising when we<br>started doing these videos was that the<br>vast majority of the spores weren't<br>actually moving with the droplets at all<br>look at this see all these spores that<br>are being tossed up here actually as<br>part of the impact well as it turns out<br>when we started monitoring the<br>trajectories of these spores that were<br>being dry dispersed not with the<br>raindrops but as a result of the<br>Raindrop moving through the air and<br>impacting with the surface we saw these<br>dry spores were being caught up in these<br>turbulent air currents and the vast<br>majority of the spores were actually<br>moving uh via dry air independent of the<br>droplets which was counterintuitive and<br>something unexpected and ultimately<br>resulted in this beautiful paper in pnas<br>uh that describ these microscopic<br>vortices and so essentially as a<br>raindrop impacted the surface these<br>vortices were generated this is a PIV<br>model essentially showing each trace of<br>each Spore as it forms a mini tornado<br>carrying those spores up into the air<br>and over some distance away from the<br>leaf um this right here on the x-axis<br>shows the droplet velocity and then<br>number of spores so as the Raindrop<br>velocity increases uh onto the surface<br>of the leaf we see more spores actually<br>becoming Airborne uh as one might expect<br>faster the moving droplet the more is<br>going to come up and the same is true<br>when it uh when it uh um relates to<br>dispersal distance this gray line that<br>you see here is actually a model not<br>incorporating those dry dispersed spores<br>only those are being dispersed uh via<br>the water droplets but when we include<br>of course uh the dry dispersal we see<br>the the vast majority of the inoculum<br>falls way out here and is transported<br>over greater distances which is pretty<br>exciting now Jonathan Breo is uh is an<br>expert in uh well he's a mechanical<br>engineer but he's an expert in surface<br>chemistry and also condensation and so<br>um he's been working a lot in this space<br>of um condensation and druming droplets<br>so when condensate uh actually forms on<br>the surface uh of on a hydrophobic<br>surface when the droplets of condensate<br>actually C a really interesting<br>phenomenon happens and that is the<br>droplets can jump away from the surface<br>and so as these come these droplets come<br>together the energy the Collision is<br>transferred and they can spontaneously<br>jump away and so we hypothesize that hey<br>jumping droplet condensation might<br>actually be occurring as a fundamental<br>mechanism for pathogen transport so to<br>look at this we set up a high-speed<br>video camera we of course created<br>conditions that allowed condensate to<br>form on these wheat leaves and former<br>graduate student Dr Nath observed of<br>course these jumping droplets as they<br>moved away from the surface you can see<br>them there so once again uh droplets are<br>coming together they're colliding and<br>then spontaneously jumping away from the<br>surface and you can see that in these<br>different panes and we'll look at it in<br>a variety of different ways sometimes a<br>droplet jumps it lands it collides with<br>another droplet and then it jumps again<br>almost like pool cues for those of you<br>that like to play pool as these droplets<br>Jump Around you'll see that here there's<br>a trace the droplet is actually going<br>landing and then boom it bounces again<br>as it collides with another droplet okay<br>so can these droplets really be carrying<br>spores well this is the money shot so<br>you're going to see from the top down<br>now looking at that infected Leaf you'll<br>see um a droplet actually jump towards<br>the camera so look here you'll see a<br>droplet uh boom jump away from the<br>surface now um what's uh even more<br>impressive about this is that of course<br>spores will be carried um in that<br>droplet now um you'll not only see it in<br>the video because there are threee<br>adenus spores you'll see them actually<br>be carried away with that droplet this<br>to jump away from the surface but we<br>found a way to actually quantify the<br>number of spores in the droplets using a<br>u of course the spores are now gone had<br>put that into the video um in terms of<br>dispersal distances and mechanisms and<br>and Jonathan really liked the idea that<br>these plants were sneezing and so our P<br>our first paper um he actually put the<br>sexy title sneezing plants pathogen<br>transport Ving jumping jumping droplet<br>condensation the idea that the plant is<br>trying to expel of course this agent<br>that's on its surface of course uh um um<br>personifying what's happening here with<br>this phenomena and so another gr student<br>Dr mucker G looked at the synergistic<br>effects of the jumping droplet<br>condensation and also wind um this was<br>subject of another pnas paper where we<br>took an infected wheat surface we<br>generated that the uh the conditions<br>favorable for condensation and then um<br>we had a little fan we could adjust<br>essentially the the speed of the fan to<br>then blow across the surface these are<br>water sensitive papers they're yellow<br>and when you get a little bit of water<br>on them they actually turn blue and so<br>um when a droplet lands on the surface<br>of those water sensitive papers of<br>course it turns blue and then you can<br>spot the droplets and then of course<br>spot the spores inside of them so this<br>is where two droplets landed on one of<br>those papers and then you can physically<br>uh actually just count the uh your adini<br>spor as that travel in the droplets and<br>so um Dr muckery did this uh looking of<br>course at different wind speeds here<br>half a meter per second and on the<br>bottom one and a half meters per second<br>different distances on the x-axis which<br>represent different distances away<br>downwind from the source and then the<br>number of spores and of course as wind<br>speed cranks up as one might expect the<br>number of spores dispersed at greater<br>distances from the Spore Source increase<br>and so there is a definitely a<br>synergistic effect of both wind and<br>jumping drop condensation as part of<br>this phenomenon we move now to the farm<br>scale uh looking of course at tens tens<br>to hundreds of meters the crop field<br>infested plants are residues and this<br>story takes us back uh not only to that<br>Irish Potato Famine I mentioned um a big<br>biocurity project which was part of my<br>first major Grant uh at Virginia Tech uh<br>to study the long-distance transport of<br>phyto infestans from infected Fields<br>this is what the organism phyto<br>infestans actually does um it's um it<br>basically kills uh the the plant host<br>here a potato and then it creates these<br>Halos of spanga these sprang um are on<br>sprang fors they like microscopic lemons<br>they can pop off move through the<br>atmosphere and if the conditions are<br>right when it lands that little lemon<br>can actually turn into eight swimming<br>spores so you've got a pathogen here<br>that can fly and they can swim and this<br>was a large uh this was in large part of<br>course in uh um also the lack of host<br>resistance which ultimately led to uh<br>the famine years wiping out potatoes<br>across all of ourland so um we set up<br>some experiments where we created a big<br>source of phyto infests just like you<br>saw in the picture and we deployed um<br>what is now considered to be sort of uh<br>an old historical technology these are<br>remote controlled aircraft um that were<br>uh at the time um integrated with<br>sophisticated autopilots um these had<br>Petri plates on the wings so they open<br>and Clos like a clam shell from the<br>ground so we could fly these up we could<br>open up these Petri plates and then we<br>could capture pathogens in the<br>atmosphere at different altitudes and uh<br>the autonomy portion was something that<br>was particularly novel for us so that<br>they could communicate with each other<br>um during all this operation so this<br>takes us back more than 15 years when we<br>were doing this work actually nearly two<br>decades um during a in a little uh grass<br>field which is now a paved Runway our<br>drone infrastructure has come a long way<br>at Virginia Tech but our some our humble<br>beginnings um I always like to show some<br>of our good takeoff and landings the<br>unplanned Landings you won't see<br>although you may hear about them these<br>are two aircraft that had very what was<br>sophisticated at the time mind you<br>state-of-the-art technology is allowing<br>them to speed up slow down and basically<br>enter sample and exit a spor plume at<br>the very same time and this enabled us<br>to uh essentially accurately quantify<br>the number of spores or sporangia rather<br>that were coming from the source and so<br>this Advanced our ability to track of<br>course a pathogen hundreds of meters<br>from a source field and this is a result<br>of some of our modeling work where on<br>the x-axis we have the concentration of<br>actual spanga that we observed um here<br>within the framework uh of 100 meters<br>from our source and then of course to<br>our model which we developed as a result<br>and a pretty darn good fit for what our<br>model was able to predict was in the air<br>and what our drones were actually<br>capturing we of course have extended<br>this to an entirely different framework<br>now um in the context of the movement of<br>genetically modified organisms so in the<br>US transgenic crops are of course<br>commonplace uh and of course we're able<br>to set up some very unique experiments<br>uh given of course certain permissions<br>and permits being obtained and so um we<br>have done some work in Tennessee in a<br>special permitted location this is a<br>Forest that's been clear-cut in the<br>middle of the Appalachian Mountains in<br>Tennessee and what we have here are two<br>plots of transgenic crops um ex<br>expressing orange fluoresent protein um<br>here ubiquitous so that means this crop<br>is producing this orange fluoresent<br>protein in all of its tissues and then<br>here only in the pollen um we're of<br>course interested in studying the<br>movement of pollen over long distances<br>with important implications for an<br>individual who's say growing a<br>non-transgenic CR that's growing<br>something immediately adjacent to an<br>individual that is the pollen then of<br>course can move and of course fertilize<br>the adjacent crop and so as part of this<br>experiment we set up traps essentially<br>for this pollen at different distances<br>around the source field and then also a<br>drone um equipped with a novel sensing<br>package with all describe here in just a<br>minute um this will take you through<br>that campaign show you um sort of how we<br>operate uh here's our switchcraft field<br>the panicles uh of course releasing<br>pollen during discrete intervals during<br>the day we have a big uh this is called<br>Mar of our mobile AAL research vehicle<br>for transport operations sophisticated<br>weather equipment and give you an idea<br>of basically our field s side and<br>operations uh we have sensors on the<br>ground that are both passive and active<br>uh those that just collect any pollen<br>that comes by just by wind active<br>actually pumping of course air through<br>the device like a vacuum to be able to<br>trap the pollen um we have a sampling<br>arrays set up with different types of<br>equipment and predominantly downwind<br>distances to enable us to accurately<br>quantify the movement of that pollen<br>both from uh of course empirical<br>framework um but then also ultimately to<br>derive some of the the modeling<br>components which will be pushing our<br>ability to understand the transport of<br>this pollen over long distances of<br>course when we set up these field<br>experiments we have a lot of people<br>involved our teams are generally a dozen<br>or more on the ground to be able to do<br>these experiments and intensively sample<br>across an irval now the stuff on the<br>ground ends up being of course fixed<br>sampling devices we've developed a lot<br>of 3D printed sampling packages<br>including impingers which you'll see<br>highlighted these impingers take air<br>samples they pump them through a liquid<br>uh the the particles are then trapped in<br>that liquid and then we're able to of<br>course quantify them uh back in the<br>laboratory and so uh you uh you might<br>have seen a drone popping up there that<br>drone will be featured here in just a<br>minute this is that drone carrying that<br>impinging package um meteorological<br>sensor package uh as well and so this of<br>course can move uh different distances<br>different altitudes from The Source<br>depending on the way the wind is going<br>and you'll get a chance to see the<br>bubbling going on here right in that<br>impinger right on front that impinger<br>can be built for about a dollar um it's<br>just a 3D printed top built around a 15<br>mil Chronicle tube and so um uh having<br>these sort of additive Manufacturing<br>Technologies anybody around the world<br>with a 3D printer can of course uh use<br>and adapt becomes very important and uh<br>uh a very similar style of sampling was<br>deployed here in New Zealand as we<br>developed a 3D printed water sampler<br>around a 50 mil conical tube that could<br>be printed by anyone as well and U this<br>is a rather large platform as you might<br>be able to tell as I'm landing you here<br>um it's it's quite big with really big<br>propellers that are somewhat Danger and<br>so you want to keep your distance this<br>just shows some of that work in October<br>of this shows some of the data showing<br>our movement of our transgenic pollen<br>here within the uh the framework of 25<br>meter distance from our source of course<br>the pollen um with very close to the<br>source is released in uh in Fairly large<br>amounts it decreases with distance<br>similar to what we saw within that<br>millimeter scale transport as well uh<br>these represent different intervals<br>during the day with the pollen really<br>being released mostly in the later part<br>of the afternoon there's the panicles<br>open up basically after lunch for a<br>couple hours release most of their<br>pollen and then they're done until the<br>next day which is really quite<br>interesting and something we were able<br>to observe now you can't actually<br>physically see the pollen in the air and<br>this is a problem when you're trying to<br>model agents and they're transporting<br>the atmosphere you can't see them you<br>can't see pollen you can't see pathogens<br>but what you can see is smoke<br>particularly colored smoke and so um we<br>took advantage of uh a relatively new<br>technology that's been available and<br>these are called Smoke emitters now<br>these smoke emitters really uh were<br>designed um largely for baby gender<br>reveals and so um blue and pink are the<br>most common colors uh that you can of<br>course uh get um we played with a<br>variety of different colors um in trying<br>to do some of our sensing now of course<br>these aren't true colors is the way it's<br>being um implemented on the screen but<br>you can see a a yellow emitter the<br>emitter um these are fairly inexpensive<br>they're about $20 or about 35 New<br>Zealand dollars they last for about a<br>minute and a half and then of course uh<br>um you could do all sorts of wonderful<br>things uh with these smoke plumes um<br>here's a blue one of course set off we<br>were tuning um some of our cameras uh to<br>be able to accurately uh not only image<br>the plume but we were collecting samples<br>of the colored smoke and then<br>quantifying it with the spectr<br>photometer back in the lab so that we<br>could compare physical sample collection<br>also with our Imaging and so this just<br>shows some of that work um there this is<br>our now Advanced drone um facility which<br>was grasped before but we got money to<br>pave it um you know if you build it it<br>will come Virginia Tech became one of<br>the six FAA designated drone test sites<br>in the nation and this was a large part<br>of that um here's that very same drone<br>equipped Now with an optical particle<br>counter it's giving us uh real-time<br>measurements uh every second of particle<br>concentrations and of course we can also<br>use that particle counter to distinguish<br>the colors as well and this just shows<br>how the plumes can change Move With the<br>Wind move with turbulence among other<br>things and I'll illustrate some of that<br>um in some of our model dispersion<br>uh in just a little bit here in the<br>absence of wind of course the plumes are<br>going vertically and once again you<br>can't see pathogens poen uh these other<br>little microscopic things but this is an<br>excellent tool for you to be able to<br>visualize where something is going and<br>in fact we incorporated these smoke<br>plumes into our future experiments as<br>well uh involving pollen so that we<br>could actually see where the pollen was<br>likely to go and then position our drone<br>uh basically in the Smoke plume and so<br>this shows some of our modeling<br>flameworks showing an over over top view<br>of a high wind condition with the plume<br>and so you can see that from a<br>horizontal perspective when you have<br>high winds your plume is very shallow<br>okay but of course when the winds are<br>quite low you get a really a plume<br>that's much much more Steep and vertical<br>orientation and of course the model is<br>able to pick that up so if you have<br>real-time inputs from your weather<br>stations in particular telling you about<br>wind gusts wind speed you have an idea<br>of temperature and relative humidity you<br>can actually then uh be able to uh um<br>validate these models with uh these<br>these beautiful uh colored colored poke<br>colored smoke emitting U um<br>instrumentation we'll move on quickly to<br>the regional scale um here we're looking<br>at something that uh comprises something<br>like the uh maybe a a region here in New<br>Zealand and the US a state um scale tens<br>of kilometers um large Farmland Etc we<br>did some work down in the um um The<br>Plains of Colorado beautiful state in<br>the United States where we deployed um a<br>very interesting wind sens package on<br>board our drone and we tested it against<br>some groundbased instrumentation and so<br>um here's a drone over here flying with<br>a Sonic anomer on top of it and we have<br>that very same Sonic anomer on a ground<br>station along with a 3D Sonic anomer<br>right here as well and then we also flew<br>it adjacent to a tower with a fixed<br>instrumentation and here's some<br>validation of the Drone based sensor<br>against some of these groundbased<br>measurements um here the uas is this<br>Trace which is in yellow and you can see<br>it almost perfectly traces of course the<br>tower B measurements at four and 2<br>meters um over a sampling Mission um<br>former graduate student Dr Nolan did<br>this uh beautiful work where we of<br>course took our instrumented package<br>once again open source GitHub files are<br>out there anybody can build uh of course<br>the sensor package and integrated into a<br>drone mounted onto the airframe um the<br>engineering model is quite simple you<br>have little bits and pieces that you can<br>print put all together with a little<br>microcontroller and of course your<br>sensor and you can turn your drone into<br>a weather station and that's precisely<br>what we did um so it's not just about<br>trapping things but also recording<br>weather we did calibration flights uh<br>over this first uh um little power<br>system here which was quite small near<br>the ground um our sensor on the Drone<br>the drone on the tower and then of<br>course flying adjacent to uh this big<br>central tower which ended up being home<br>for all these drone swarms and so we had<br>uh 150 some odd people out there for<br>this campaign flying all sorts of<br>different drones uh comparing their<br>measurements against this uh this<br>groundbased station so then we put two<br>drones in the air the same time and we<br>triangulated sensing uh between the two<br>drones and then also um basically what<br>was happening on that groundbased<br>station and uh Dr Nolan was able to<br>monitor these windfields um across the<br>entire Valley that we were sampling and<br>then also identify um um using this warp<br>Lees model lrin coherent structures that<br>were responsible essentially for the<br>movement of a front across the sampling<br>location largely because we were able to<br>triangulate these measurements and I'll<br>talk a little bit more about lran<br>coherent structures as I talk about<br>Continental scale because this phases up<br>right to uh New Zealand as we consider<br>the Continental scale problem and many<br>of you probably remember if you were<br>here in New Zealand and uh 20 late 2019<br>early 2020 Bush Fs in Australia um quite<br>dramatic now you may not remember them<br>from the standpoint of that if you<br>weren't in Australia you're here in New<br>Zealand uh you encountered some of that<br>smoke in fact um on the 2nd of January<br>so mind you we arrived in New Zealand in<br>Christ Church on the 1st of January<br>second of January we were already on our<br>first Adventure we went out to akaroa<br>and my family and I were hiking around<br>akaroa and the air quality was horrible<br>because of the smoke that had traveled<br>in from Australia of course to New<br>Zealand and of course you can see the<br>haze here over the U um aara area and<br>then here behind us this is all haze<br>from the smoke our eyes were itching and<br>burning and the air quality was pretty<br>poor as a result of that we'll enter uh<br>ILY notorious um Ela approached my<br>colleague Shang Ross and I and she was<br>quite interested in thinking about air<br>bridges that could connect um Australia<br>to New Zealand and so um she used uh the<br>the smoke coming from the Australian bro<br>brush fires as a means to study these<br>potential air Bridges and so here on the<br>top um you can see satellite images of<br>that smoke actually leaving Australia<br>and of course arriving to New Zealand um<br>over different dates in January 1 of<br>January second January 3rd of January<br>and the 6th of January and then these<br>air Bridges um which were computed using<br>this modeling framework uh based on the<br>Gran coherent structures and my<br>colleague Shane Ross uh really<br>engendered uh this language of lran<br>coherent structures in the context of<br>pathogen transport and so um um Elsa<br>went ahead and applied this to uh<br>potential forecasting for invasions into<br>New Zealand uh here um forecasted at the<br>time for fall army worm uh basically if<br>it was going to come uh to New Zealand<br>where would it be coming from from<br>Australia and so uh she started looking<br>forward in time along different pressure<br>surfaces here<br>950 um 850 and 700 which correspond to<br>different altitudes um of course at<br>different times identifying these<br>connections these bridges in the<br>atmosphere by which an intruder or an<br>Invader could travel from Australia to<br>New Zealand this ultimately became of<br>course uh the framework uh for the uh<br>successful MB bid which is part of of<br>the uh the project ultimately that<br>brought me back here to New Zealand and<br>so we had a really nice paper um of<br>course published in ecological<br>applications that highlights this work<br>and was the preliminary data that also<br>needed to be able to land uh that Grant<br>and so we'll be talking about this next<br>week down in Christ Church and of course<br>thinking about not only these air<br>Bridges but where do you sample in New<br>Zealand going given this knowledge of uh<br>these air Bridges and their occurrence<br>and their frequency to be able to set up<br>a framework that will most accurately<br>represent where you should actually be<br>positioned to actually collect something<br>okay so enough about air and plants<br>let's talk a little bit about the air<br>water interface and for those of you<br>that of course are engaged in uh in work<br>in non-terrestrial environments but into<br>water this will be of interest so um we<br>moved into this space largely because<br>we're obsessed with this question how<br>are microbes actually transported from<br>the water to the air of course if you<br>spend any time along the coast um you're<br>certainly aware that breaking waves can<br>do a pretty good job at aerosolizing<br>things you spent time waterfalls you<br>might have gotten misted of course by<br>the aerosols generated by the waterfall<br>and of course all of that Hydro power<br>also is a pretty significant generator<br>of aerosols and in the US we certainly<br>have a number of hydroelectric plants<br>particularly um near uh near my home<br>base in blackburg Virginia the clayer<br>Lake Dam produces a considerable source<br>of energy and of course here in New<br>Zealand you certainly have a tremendous<br>amount of hydroelectric power as well<br>well harmful Alo blooms caused mostly by<br>toxic bacteria can be problematic when<br>we think about aerosol production and<br>generation and there's a considerable<br>amount of work that's been done with red<br>tides for example where uh toxins<br>produced by this dagul called rev toxins<br>can move Inland and cause all sorts of<br>respiratory issues with Inland<br>communities and so we've been obsessed<br>and thinking about uh the transport of<br>um the toxins and Associated<br>cyanobacterial cells as they move from<br>the water into the land um so applying a<br>similar sort of framework and scaling it<br>up one of the first things that we did<br>was actually observe these phenomena<br>inside a controlled Flume uh scenario<br>former graduate student Dr Peach set up<br>a really skinny Flume basically filled<br>it with a solution of bacteria and then<br>using a high-speed video camera was able<br>to actually study aerosolization<br>processes at different wind speeds and<br>so the wind comes in here basically is<br>accelerated across the surface of the<br>water it then departs The Flume and then<br>the camera is viewing what's happening<br>right here and of course when you do<br>this you can see all all sorts of<br>beautiful aerosolization phenomena this<br>is a very similar technology that we<br>highlighted of course with the splashing<br>spores here creating different types of<br>droplets jet droplets um among other<br>things that are results of these<br>collisions of course When You observe<br>these different phenomena you can see<br>bubble bursting phenomena as they evolve<br>uh and particles uh are entrained and<br>then ejected including bacteria or cyan<br>or bacterial cells you can see<br>fragmentation where droplets will Shear<br>off uh taking bits and pieces of<br>material with them uh into the<br>atmosphere and transport it over some<br>distance now the size of the droplet and<br>the nature of that droplet can<br>ultimately help determine some of those<br>transport distances among other things<br>and of course um when you apply um some<br>uh rather simple models on probability<br>distributions you can see how these<br>things shift in terms of bubble bursting<br>versus fragmentation at different wind<br>speeds here on the left 3 and half m/<br>second on the right at four these shift<br>in terms of your droplet diameter and<br>the probability distributions and so<br>this ultimately is something that you<br>have to feed into a model if you're<br>trying to understand um the potential<br>downwind transport of an agent given<br>certain types of environmental<br>conditions and so this is exactly um<br>what we've been building in and thinking<br>about in the terms of surface scum and<br>large lakes that can be sources of<br>cyanobacterial blooms and adjacent<br>communities that can be breathing air of<br>course that could potentially be<br>toxic now um we spent a lot of time<br>training our robots uh to actually study<br>study these phenomena and so I'll show<br>you some of our work out at clater Lake<br>which is about 30 minutes from blackburg<br>Virginia um we've used fluorescent dyes<br>that we've released into the water this<br>is Florine and we have a robot uh here<br>with a fluorometer on it it's actually<br>able to um to then characterize the<br>plume in real time as it traverses the<br>florene plume here the sensors on the<br>front of this robot and of course we can<br>coordinate our drone based measurements<br>also with our robotic measurements to<br>provide not only predictions from the<br>drone images but the Institue<br>measurement in real time that the robot<br>is making here too so this is uh<br>illustrating the concept of coordinated<br>robotics where you've got an aerial<br>vehicle doing some Imaging and then<br>you've got a um a robot doing the insitu<br>sampling and characterization as well<br>this doesn't happen just in Lakes but<br>also happens out in the O of the open<br>ocean we had a big NSF hazards project<br>where we dumped $50,000 of ramine d off<br>the back of this research vessel and<br>then we tracked it for the better part<br>of a week and a half out in the middle<br>of the Atlantic Ocean this happened<br>south of marth's Vineyard um for those<br>you're familiar with a little bit of us<br>topography This research vessel of<br>course deployed a variety of different<br>uh um uh floating systems that gave us<br>uh position uh or and current<br>information both at the top but then<br>also subsurface measurements of about U<br>30 meters down at the bottom of the<br>ocean here you're going to see uh this<br>plume of ramine D that comes off the<br>ship now the ship captain was trying to<br>create a spiral but he did not plan on<br>currents and he didn't believe me that<br>he didn't create a spiral he actually<br>messed up the pattern until I showed him<br>the Drone measurements and the drone<br>images and you can see that here his<br>actual Trace was a nice little spiral um<br>with with no current but of course what<br>happened was this large swath of dye um<br>we sent a rib out made some measurements<br>of course of uh of the FL the ramine D<br>at or near the surface and<br>characterizing the plume within the<br>first few square miles um really within<br>the first couple hours of release and<br>then of course the plume had spread so<br>far we then had to use the ship to make<br>those measurements in that early part of<br>the characterization here just within a<br>few hours we were already over a square<br>mile away from that little ship of<br>course the um the Drone base measurement<br>show that here we deployed uh a drone<br>base water sampling system which I'll<br>feature and highlight later on this is a<br>3D printed uh um water sampler that of<br>course has a 15 mil conical tube you can<br>swap those out and go out take images of<br>the die um and then swing the sample<br>back swap it out grab another one and<br>then we have a fluorometer on board the<br>The Vessel to be able to characterize<br>that we have an underwater robot that<br>I'm piloting here with also with a<br>fluorometer so you have surface<br>measurements and then of course a robot<br>can dive down and collect samples it has<br>a water sampler on the end of it and<br>then also die based measurements for<br>those of you that spent time on Research<br>vessels um they of course are built for<br>um individuals of much short shorter<br>stature than I am I'm 65 and so I hit my<br>head a lot so was walking around this<br>ship the<br>Connecticut of course uh um we spend a<br>lot of time at lakes that uh that need<br>Rehabilitation this is great Grand Lake<br>St Mary is a hyper utopic Lake uh in<br>Ohio very close to um one of our Great<br>Lakes great uh Lake Erie uh this lake is<br>quite uh quite shallow in fact its<br>deepest part in the lake is two meters<br>and so I could almost walk across it<br>with my head above water um if I wanted<br>to uh not not not quite but this also is<br>um the source of drinking water uh for a<br>town of about 3,000 people and the<br>person who runs the um water treatment<br>plant which has to hit it with about<br>eight different treatments is the most<br>popular person in town because if they<br>do their job right everybody gets water<br>unfortunately throughout the entire year<br>levels of microen produced by plank thck<br>which predominates in this Lake um are<br>well above contact uh advisory<br>thresholds um and drinking water<br>advisory thresholds for most of the year<br>with the exception of the winter time<br>when you do get some licing of the cell<br>so here you have winter spring summer<br>and fall and this is a decade worth of<br>measurements at Grand Lake St Mary's and<br>so um it's got microsystem pretty much<br>in it all year round um we deployed uh<br>some drone uh based sampling<br>methodologies of course this is prior to<br>the pandemic we then came here to New<br>Zealand and um I deployed that similar<br>technology studying Lakes across this<br>beautiful country but I'll introduce<br>this now um the Drone has a little<br>simple tether on it that U uh conical<br>tube a 15 mil sterile tube and then on<br>top you've got this little swinging<br>bucket type design that then is<br>connected to a string and this allows<br>you to collect transects away from the<br>shore with the idea that the drone goes<br>out and we deploy this in 10 meter<br>transects 10 meter collect a sample come<br>back 20 meters collect a sample come<br>back 30 MERS and you can get 10 samples<br>in a control in about 10 minutes Dennis<br>actually went out with me and we<br>collected some samples here in naroto<br>using this very same method and of<br>course um you then can analyze these<br>samples and you can see Trends here for<br>example with sort of Peaks and valleys<br>as it associated with different types of<br>coners or flavors of Micro Systems um<br>and so you don't see often times this<br>homogeneous distribution of these toxins<br>at surface LEL um you do see some<br>hotspots which of course has very<br>important uh implications for sampling<br>methodologies by which you would be<br>thinking about whether want you want to<br>grab one sample or maybe 10 or more to<br>characterize um a lake of interest at a<br>given time um we also did some work of<br>course with wind sensing uh to be able<br>to determine the potential movement of<br>the cyanotoxin the micro Inland and this<br>is former graduate student um Dr Javier<br>Gonzalez Roso is now a assistant<br>professor at the University Cal Santa<br>Cruz where the Drone itself becomes your<br>wind sensor um and so this is a very<br>very powerful tool in that context we<br>also did quite a bit of work trapping<br>cyanobacterial cells and toxins uh<br>inside these small tubes and we reported<br>that in a recent environmental science<br>paper just this last year so that very<br>same sampling method of course for<br>sampling pollen for sampling microbes<br>can also be deployed in this<br>context now um where does this go in<br>terms of uh New Zealand well of course<br>um when I was here was um taking<br>advantage of opportunities to get out<br>and study lakes that were in need of<br>Rehabilitation um lake weari is certain<br>one of certainly one of those lakes and<br>it just so happened uh though the color<br>scheme here does not really show it um<br>when we first collected that very first<br>sample shortly before lockdown 18th of<br>March 2020 the lake was very green it<br>then had throttled uh of course to a um<br>an orange uh sort of chocy color um<br>largely due to monor fibian sort<br>monoraphidium sort of taking over um<br>moreto used to be here actually was was<br>featured in an article um that rolled<br>the October 2020 and um I had the<br>opportunity to make multiple visits to<br>this Lake and collect repeated<br>measurements this is work who used to be<br>a technician here at the University and<br>spent quite a bit of time out in the<br>field um believe it or not he's not<br>actually staging the shot he was down on<br>one KN just helping manage some of those<br>samples and so we're adjacent during one<br>of these we deployed the Drone we<br>collected samp and then we also of<br>course deployed a drone with a<br>multispectral camera system that allowed<br>us to generate some inverse ndvi<br>measurements that you can see here<br>related to sort of this color of this<br>throttling of change so we made five<br>different visits to U muari which is um<br>which was pretty cool from the 20th of<br>March uh uh or the 18th of March 2020 uh<br>to September and then it throttled back<br>to green again and then sort of<br>sustained itself even into March of the<br>following year um with that sort of<br>chocolatey brown color again<br>predominating with monoraphidium and uh<br>of course we took measurements of fosy<br>and chlorophyll along these transects<br>and were able to document some of these<br>Trends were that were associated of<br>course um with these shifts in um Blu<br>green algae that were occurring in the<br>lake and uh thanks to Dennis's great<br>work with this hidden gems of wado book<br>um he invited us to contribute a feature<br>box which is part of this chapter led by<br>Ian on Plankton where we describe this<br>technology and just a couple of the<br>sampling uh uh dates in U as car which<br>is which is fantastic and we thank you<br>for that Dennis really really proud to<br>be part of that um I did want to mention<br>that um of course uh some of our work<br>really extended to some incredible<br>places um if you've never made it to the<br>cadams I encourage you to go um it's one<br>of the more unique places I've ever been<br>on this planet um I thought I'd just<br>share with you one brief uh video here<br>that highlights some of that wonderful<br>work at the chatam and you can<br>understand a little bit about how Lakes<br>380 operates as well and so um um this<br>is a series of I put together these sort<br>of action films if you will from some of<br>our different Adventures this is piki a<br>very unique Lake um Pete Lake that<br>actually is separated by a sandar from<br>the ocean you'll see that in a visual<br>shot here we did drone sampling here on<br>this Lake um and some of these im images<br>will of course feature that's Celeste<br>down there with some of our drone<br>sampling um this is that sand bar here<br>the ocean and then this really unique<br>almost perfect sort of circular shape um<br>in fact um some Garnett were uh in the<br>sand if you kind of crawled around on<br>your hands and knees you could find the<br>stones um this have a little C unique<br>surface Bloom here that we were studying<br>um as well as another another Lake and<br>then you'll see um you'll see shortly<br>some of the Lakes 380 crew actually out<br>collecting cores from these Lakes so<br>depending on where we were at and what<br>we were doing um oftentimes we were<br>sampling at the same time or we were<br>sampling at different times depending on<br>our Target and um and what was going on<br>we uh linked up with Tom um who actually<br>um his faka papa goes all the way back<br>to the original Ori who of course<br>colonized chattam islands and he let us<br>sample his Lake on his land um rooa and<br>so this is the lak 38 team out there<br>deploying a um of course a core<br>collecting sediment cores at the deepest<br>part of the lake um illustrating some of<br>that so they would go out collect the<br>sediment core there was another team<br>that went out and collected uh all sorts<br>of different samples as part of water<br>quality measurements of course there<br>were cattle running around as well<br>amongst these activities and then uh um<br>of course these beautiful sort of uh<br>volcanic cones that are remnants in the<br>back as well and some of that<br>multispectral imagery just highlighting<br>the really incredible Topography of the<br>cadams um this is Susie off here and<br>Marcus and Tom down here as well um this<br>Lake actually didn't have a name but<br>there was a creek that went into it and<br>the creek was called tongoa so the lake<br>became sort of known as tongoa um and<br>this one of course had quite an<br>interesting um color to it um collected<br>samples out there and then of course you<br>can see the Lakes 380 team this is cat<br>she was was um collecting samples uh for<br>some uh pollen work that she's done<br>she's a penologist u many of you might<br>might know who she is um and then we<br>actually Susie had led a run uh she's um<br>of course stays fit is always out she<br>takes a break from a research and goes<br>off for a run she went up to the top of<br>uh um this um volcanic cone and then we<br>followed her to get some drone images of<br>the lake and you'll see that shortly uh<br>bit and here we are up on the top of<br>this mountain uh here and just a cool<br>challenge there's music too but uh turn<br>that down we started about 10 minutes<br>late so I'll just finish with something<br>we're doing right now and then hopefully<br>there'll be time for some questions um<br>we've been moving a lot of our work into<br>the study of air ice water interfaces is<br>sort of a new phase of our work and so<br>um um of course with climate change<br>comes the collapse of many of our<br>glaciers um cing phenomena like this one<br>that you see here of course causes a<br>tremendous amount of material to uh to<br>enter environments um some of these cing<br>events have uh caused increasing<br>nutrient loading in regions which have<br>led to cyob bacterial blooms among other<br>things and so we're interested in<br>studying processes by which cracking and<br>basically melting of these glacial<br>environments can cause particles to move<br>into the water and also into the air<br>this is of a security issue in in the US<br>um in fact we have a lot of people like<br>to go ice fishing so in the Great Lakes<br>just uh back in the January 2022 a big<br>sheet Ice broke off uh people were ice<br>fishing and of course they didn't have<br>boats they driven out on vehicles and so<br>they had to be rescued um and so<br>understanding cracking phenomena extends<br>not only to Glaciers but also to present<br>day ice fishermen as well so we've been<br>doing some work in the lab um taking um<br>artificial ice that we can make in the<br>lab seated with dye and then we've been<br>watching it basically melt and then<br>understanding sort of how that melt<br>water is transported uh through the<br>water and then ultimately we'll be doing<br>aerosolization experiments you can see<br>that melt water shedding the dye here<br>and of course the rolling of this ice<br>bulk which is quite interesting and then<br>we've been using of course um thermal<br>cameras to examine this phenomena so<br>here you're going to see the cold sort<br>of um in this uh this darker blue and<br>then the warmer area of the warmer water<br>of course is more of a a yellow and<br>you're going to see here a top down look<br>and um you notice this Cube basically<br>flip and what you'll see are tendrils of<br>melt water that you'll be that you can<br>observe largely due to this heat<br>signature so um that's pretty cool so<br>you can't see these with a naked eye<br>obviously unless you're looking at<br>actual th this is melt water that's<br>moving throughout here so using<br>Technologies like this we can begin to<br>understand um these melting and cracking<br>phenomena and that's something that's<br>obsessing our work at the moment and uh<br>we just got a new Grant funded to<br>actually study this um at Lake mundota<br>which is near uh University of Wisconsin<br>Madison so we'll be deploying<br>Technologies to study these phenomena in<br>the coming years so with that um I still<br>say that I do have 10 minutes because of<br>our late start hopefully there's some<br>time for some questions I'm happy to<br>take them if any of you<br>you yeah people are happy to stay around<br>absolutely we have time for<br>questions open the chat box to yeah yeah<br>go<br>ahead yeah go ahead um it strikes me<br>that a lot of your data is is visual um<br>and I'm wondering about like some tools<br>that you use to quantify that and maybe<br>the balance between like a human<br>observation measurement versus maybe<br>some more machine learning or other<br>technology that you guys use yeah I<br>appreciate that so um one of my graduate<br>students who just finished up he<br>actually defended last week um actually<br>has taken some of our um our data in the<br>imagery face particularly with the<br>colored smoke plooms has applied some<br>machine learning models to actually<br>quantify uh or make estimates of those<br>concentrations and then we can calibrate<br>those images and those estimations with<br>our empirical data on the ground and so<br>we did a little bit of that with our die<br>work out in the ocean the um Atlantic<br>Ocean um as part of being able to use<br>the drone images to then predict the<br>concentrations that we actually see with<br>our fluorometer the same is true with<br>the colored smoke measurements but we<br>haven't submitted that paper yet<br>although he promised me we're going to<br>get that out hopefully in the coming<br>weeks but his thesis has been so it's a<br>great question so there's a lot more to<br>do in that space and U Ai and ml will<br>continue to be part of our future I<br>don't think we'll ever be replacing<br>empirical measurements but we'll be able<br>to probably make far fewer empirical<br>measurements and lend sort of these<br>other sort of large scale um imagery<br>based estimates to drive some of some of<br>what we're do so great it's a great<br>Point especially as we move into<br>satellite imagery among other things<br>great question<br>other yeah hey so great thanks David<br>absolutely wonderful um great stories<br>remember so um you were part of a few of<br>those Brandon I was part of a few of<br>them but your background is<br>astonishingly Sim I was a plist I know I<br>so and which was and possibly still is a<br>serious problem<br>um but it it sort of seems to have<br>had more limited effect than we sort of<br>initially thought of we thought we lose<br>all the veras and all the metrios types<br>species so um does your work say about<br>dispersal as a possible agent why we<br>haven't dispersal or is it is it Poss<br>just<br>resist dispersal resistance<br>so yeah it's it's complicated with the<br>short story is uh with rust it's<br>complicated because you need a<br>susceptible host but you also need<br>conditions favorable for infection um<br>and that includes of course the<br>susceptible host most importantly you<br>need water so rust spores are intimately<br>tied to water usually there's an 8-day<br>infection cycle for most rusts the Spore<br>lands you have to have water and then<br>you'll get your first P pustule within<br>about 8 Days okay in the absence of<br>water if it's just dry you can have the<br>spores be um be produced and blown but<br>if there's no water then the will only<br>remain viable for so long and then it<br>won't end up infecting the host and so<br>that water component is particularly<br>important and probably explains in part<br>the uh somewhat sporadic nature of the<br>disease while you'll get hot pockets of<br>Myrtle rusts in certain areas but not in<br>others in fact um when I entered through<br>Auckland uh mind you a few days ago um<br>of course the biocurity Personnel asked<br>me what I was doing here I honestly<br>shared the whole story coming for this<br>security he proceeded to ask me<br>more I I literally stood there for<br>probably 15 minutes at his window<br>because he was very interested in merust<br>and so we had a very similar<br>conversation to the one we're having<br>right now and he was so excited to be<br>talking to somebody who'd done work with<br>Russ he actually took me away and he<br>walked me around to show me where to go<br>to put my bag into the scanner whereas<br>the the people ahead of me he just<br>pointed and St on the way so anyway a<br>funny uh a funny welcome to uh to new Ze<br>he also asked if I brought any rorts<br>with me as part of of course the answer<br>was so I don't know if that gets at your<br>question brenon but it's it's a<br>complicated nature of of host of<br>environment uh and then of course that<br>atmospheric transport and dispersal<br>event which is something that we're<br>hoping to get a pretty good<br>understanding uh on as part of this m<br>project and it includes insects too not<br>just pathogens but my expertise of<br>course is in the pathogen Arena insects<br>have Behavior which creates a whole<br>another really complicated aspect<br>because they can make choices about<br>where they go and what they do the<br>limited viability in the<br>SP yeah um that certainly is an issue um<br>and so one of the criticisms a lot of<br>folks will do DNA based uh tracking of<br>agents in filter samples among other<br>things but that that won't tell you<br>anything about viability um and so a lot<br>of these sort of Baseline collections<br>which are wonderful can tell you about<br>these potential Invaders but of course<br>if it's all dead um then it's not going<br>to really matter in terms of it's going<br>to get<br>established yeah uh so you mentioned<br>that Allen and sports tend to not have a<br>visual component when they're dispersed<br>um do they have a chemical uh component<br>that could be sent since in in Li of a<br>visual kind of component yeah I mean<br>that's a really good question so um so<br>Andy Al at the University of Michigan in<br>the US has been looking at signatures um<br>of sort of aerosol signatures that are<br>associated with the transport of other<br>things and so um um if you monitor these<br>uh other things that are associated with<br>say a pollen grain or a um a<br>cyanobacterial cell then you can use<br>that as a proxy to study the agent of<br>interest and so I think we're really<br>just in the infancy of that but I think<br>the shorter answer is probably in the<br>future we can look at uh studying other<br>things to study the target organisms<br>that we want to actually understand if<br>how are you great all very interesting<br>I'm just curious the ndvi kind of<br>imagery you were showing there um what<br>kind of data do you get out of that and<br>how you yeah so what we to to be honest<br>we haven't we haven't published anything<br>from any of that imagery yet our Our<br>Hope was to be able to um to use some of<br>the imagery to better delineate the<br>spatial distribution of the Habs on the<br>surface and so the RGB images are<br>somewhat Limited in that capacity<br>um and so interestingly enough we did<br>some work with Brandon out at Lake ohway<br>and ohway had a really interesting<br>student Trail where the inlet was<br>basically depositing um the stream was<br>coming into the lake and we saw some<br>really interesting sediment signatures<br>of Transport in our ndvi images that we<br>could not see in the rgbs and so um the<br>short answer to the question is uh<br>there's a tremendous potential to take<br>advantage of the multispectral camera<br>systems we haven't fully realized yet uh<br>that but we have all the data<br>what I'd really love is to have a couple<br>students or some posts mine this<br>Treasure Trove of digital imagery that<br>we have of these lakes and be able to<br>relate that to the um the empirical data<br>that we have for the sampling and then<br>that's kind of where we want to go um um<br>and so uh in fact uh Brenan is part of<br>an ion ion Lakes project uh which I<br>think is ended if I'm if I'm not<br>mistaken brenon which was really looking<br>at hyperspectral signatures um of these<br>different lakes uh and and really<br>developing extensive data set in that<br>capacity I think there's taking those<br>type of data overlaying them with drone<br>based data satellite data there's a<br>tremendous potential to use those<br>signatures to ultimately predict water<br>quality and it comes back to kind of<br>Whitney's question can you get to where<br>you can take uh a remote sensing<br>measurement in any capacity and not have<br>to rely on empirical data and I think<br>the short answer is we're yes we're<br>moving in that direction once you can<br>tune your system and understand what an<br>image means what it stands for then um<br>you can turn turn the technology loose<br>we're seeing more of<br>that I just guess I'm just curious how<br>this was all the geospatial data is<br>working no no so the beautiful thing<br>about this is everything is geore<br>referenced and so um some of my students<br>have developed orthomosaics of entire<br>lakes and so you can literally uh and<br>it's quite easy to do now it used to be<br>quite laor ious but it's all automated<br>and so you take all your images provided<br>you fly over the entire Lake and<br>encapsulate it you can create a huge<br>orthomosaic a very high resolution<br>across the entire lakes and so all of<br>the uh lakes that we studied uh that<br>were within the right amount of size to<br>cover on One battery of the Drone we<br>have covered the entire Lake for that<br>purpose and so that comes back to that<br>question of what do you do with all the<br>data so um at every Lake we sampled uh I<br>threw I plw three drones the water<br>sampling drone the Drone to get pictures<br>and movies and<br>um to send off and share with Dennis and<br>Susie and whoever wants to see them<br>they've been made available for their<br>team to use however they like and then<br>the multispectral Drone so every Lake we<br>appear to we always had three flights y<br>three up three down and no casualties at<br>all which was of people or<br>robots be very grateful for those images<br>yeah yeah sure it's I'm I'm pleased to<br>see that they're being used in a variety<br>of capacities great awesome um I might<br>just draw the questions to close but<br>feel free to join us for lunch after<br>that uh we'll take David out for lunch<br>and yeah just continue conversation and<br>the questions there please join me in<br>thanking David again for making time to<br>you appreciation David this is a a small<br>Tonga which uh just sort of reminds you<br>you that's fantastic thank you that's<br>beautiful app
