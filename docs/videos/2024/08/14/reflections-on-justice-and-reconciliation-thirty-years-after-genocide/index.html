TS<br>TOA very pleased to welcome you here<br>this evening my name is David Tums I'm<br>the Howard Patterson professor of<br>Theology and public issues here at the<br>University of<br>atago and in tonight's public lecture<br>we're thinking back just a little over<br>30 years to the terrible events in<br>Rwanda in April 1994 the genocide and<br>we're looking forward to thinking of<br>these in terms of justice and<br>Reconciliation<br>we have two speakers who will be<br>addressing us one after the other first<br>Jonathan Moses will speak to us and<br>focus rather more on the justice and<br>then father didas will talk to us about<br>reconciliation Jonathan our first<br>Speaker trained in law in ockland and<br>during his last year in addition to his<br>studies he volunteered on Saturday<br>mornings at David L's electoral office<br>in Mong offering Community advice on<br>law he then practiced law in South<br>ockland for 14 years and was a founding<br>solicor at the mangay Community Law<br>Center in<br>1986 in 2000s his career took a slightly<br>different turn when he moved to Aria<br>Tanzania where he served for eight years<br>as a senior trial attorney at the<br>international criminal Tribunal for<br>Rwanda as it processed some of the<br>genocide after his time on the tribunal<br>from 2001 to 2008 he returned to ockland<br>to serve as a district judge we're<br>extremely grateful to Jonathan for being<br>willing to come down to mark this event<br>and share from his knowledge and<br>expertise to help us reflect on Justice<br>and Reconciliation in Rwanda please<br>welcome<br>Jonathan thank you David uh I must say<br>it's always a pleasure uh to be able to<br>speak to a group who and an audience who<br>have chosen to come along and hear me<br>speak um it's not something which I get<br>to do very<br>often um<br>in order<br>to<br>understand what happened with the<br>genocide we do need to go back a and<br>know a little bit about Rwanda and<br>history um prior to being<br>colonized uh the three ethnic groups in<br>Rwanda the Hutu the tootsi and the tuah<br>lived in relative Harmony there was a<br>is that working<br>excellent as I was saying the belgians<br>introduced an identity card system where<br>people were all given in identity card<br>which recorded an ethnicity on that<br>card<br>um those who were labeled tootsy were<br>usually labeled so because of uh their<br>physical features rather than anything<br>else in<br>particular um and there are some awful<br>photographs you can see of the belgians<br>in the 1920s going around measuring<br>people's<br>noses um those with fine features um<br>were considered to be more<br>neotic um more European looking uh and<br>therefore in the eyes of the uh<br>colonizers uh they were considered uh<br>more european-like and therefore more<br>intelligent um that as I say was<br>interpreted in a racist Manner and and<br>as a result those who were labeled took<br>were given greater access to education<br>and also were favored in uh certain<br>administrative<br>positions those policies SED the seeds<br>of ethnic division which had not<br>previously<br>existed there was a push for<br>Independence along with a number of<br>African countries in the 1950s and 60s<br>and Rwanda was no different uh there was<br>a revolution in Rwanda in the late 50s<br>which led to Independence<br>from Belgium in<br>1962 um a h Leed uh government was left<br>in place and then during the period<br>leading up to Independence and the new<br>government there was what uh many might<br>describe as a small genocide which took<br>place perhaps 20 to<br>30,000 uh tootsy were killed uh many<br>more were um persecuted and forced to<br>leave the country uh up to<br>350,000 most went North into Southern<br>Uganda those who were responsible for<br>those killings were never brought to<br>account for what they had done in 1973<br>there was a military coup and the uh<br>president uh was replaced by uh<br>president juvenile habar<br>Mana again there was a purge against<br>tootsy many were killed or fled and<br>again nothing happened to those who were<br>responsible fast forward to the uh late<br>1980s at this stage there are around<br>600,000 uh refugees uh tootsy refugees<br>living in neighboring<br>countries uh they were those who had<br>fled Rwanda and their<br>children uh and many of them<br>particularly those living in Uganda<br>wanted to return to their<br>Homeland um but the Rwandan government<br>at the time would not allow that um<br>without uh unless you had an ability to<br>show you could support<br>yourself so a the randan patriotic front<br>the<br>RPF and their military ring the uh<br>Rwandan patriotic Army were formed in<br>1988 and tried to force their way back<br>into the country in October 19<br>90 now that conflict ended in a military<br>stalemate but internationally it was<br>recognized that the situation needed to<br>be<br>addressed um and that the refugees had a<br>right to return to their<br>Homeland after that military stalemate<br>uh the UN organized peace talks between<br>the Rwandan government and the RPF they<br>took place in Arusha Tanzania and the<br>Aria Peace Accords were signed in August<br>1993 and they required amongst other<br>things that the RPF would be introduced<br>into uh integrated into government and<br>into the army that meant uh a number of<br>people in the current government and<br>army would lose their positions and the<br>powerful presidential guards were going<br>to be<br>disbanded uh that left a lot in the uh<br>Rwandan government and army upset with<br>the situation as they felt president<br>habar Mana had conceded too much in<br>those<br>negotiations around this time also there<br>were radio<br>stations uh which were constantly<br>selling pruto anti- tootsi propaganda<br>tootsy were labeled as<br>cockroaches or a nenzi and they as a<br>group they were demonized in the media<br>large stocks of machetes were imported<br>into the<br>country and it was in the midst of this<br>volatile situation that on the 6th of<br>April 1994 an airplane uh that was<br>returning from uh ongoing talks to do<br>with the Peace<br>Accords uh which carried president habar<br>Manor and others including the president<br>of Burundi was shot down as the plane<br>approached kagali Airport all on board<br>were killed and that event triggered the<br>start of a 100 days which we now know as<br>the genocide against the<br>toy within hours of the plane crash<br>roadblocks were<br>established uh throughout kagali and<br>most of the<br>country presidential guards went around<br>kagali killing uh many prominent tootsy<br>or those who were considered sympathetic<br>to the Aria<br>power sharing<br>Accords the government was replaced by<br>an interim government and its members<br>consisted of only those from extremist<br>parties uh from the various political<br>parties it was then that the genocide<br>Earnest uh orders of directions could be<br>passed down efficiently and effectively<br>through a<br>organizational structure left by the<br>belgians they had divided Rwanda into 12<br>prefectures regions each of those<br>regions had a several<br>communes each of those communes uh had<br>their own sectors each of those sectors<br>had several 10 household groups and so<br>there was a sort of pyramid um<br>organizational structure whereby orders<br>could be given to go down that structure<br>in an efficient uh manner those<br>officials who were moderate in their<br>views and didn't follow directives were<br>extremists now<br>tootsy uh obviously felt understandably<br>scared and vulnerable and many sought to<br>flee uh to places where they felt they<br>would be given<br>protection places such as churches<br>schools uh and other municipal buildings<br>often several thousand people would<br>gather at one of those buildings um<br>seeking protection uh sadly these places<br>became the sites of large scale<br>massacres to get to those places or to<br>try to get to them people would have to<br>go through<br>roadblocks roadblocks with were<br>sometimes manned by soldiers but usually<br>they were manned um or uh usually manned<br>there were some women um by<br>militia called the intera hamway they<br>were young men and some women with<br>little or no training who were armed<br>with machetes clubs other farm<br>implements a few with guns who would<br>check the identity cards and if had<br>Tootsie on the card uh then uh often<br>those would be killed on the spot or<br>taken away to another place to be<br>killed neighbors were killing<br>neighbors parishioners who worshiped<br>together beside each other in church<br>would be killing their fellow<br>parishioners government leaders military<br>leaders and communal leaders were often<br>enthusiastic and often LED the<br>killings during the course of the<br>genocide the radio stations I'd referred<br>to earlier carried out an effective and<br>efficient campaign of disinformation<br>blaming Tootsie for the conflict and C<br>for the extermination of<br>tootsy it was described as<br>work areas where there had been large<br>scale killings were described as areas<br>where people had been working<br>hard as a result of the events in Rwanda<br>over the period of 100 days best<br>estimates of that between 800,000 and a<br>million people were<br>killed primarily<br>tootsy um or those Associated married to<br>those who were<br>totsy rape was also widespread and<br>systematic and used as a tool of<br>genocide<br>of girls and<br>women Tooty women were both in both<br>print and on radio<br>demonized and violence was incited<br>against<br>women by the time the RPF had eventually<br>taken over the country in July<br>1994 those most responsible for the<br>genocide had fled<br>Rwanda most of them had gone initially<br>at least to the Congo and then on to<br>many other parts of Africa and indeed<br>other parts of the<br>world what was the world's community's<br>response to the genocide uh one of the<br>features I haven't covered at all so far<br>is that during the 100 days of the<br>genocide the world community did very<br>little to stop the<br>genocide the UN amongst other<br>organizations did not exactly cover<br>itself in glory um uh during that period<br>there were some United Nations troops<br>who were in Rwanda based in<br>kagali um who were there as part of the<br>transition uh for the per peace Accord<br>many of the best soldiers were Belgian<br>soldiers who all left after a few days<br>after the start of the<br>genocide after 10 of their number were<br>shot and killed um outside barracks in<br>kagali so in<br>1995 I should add the UN troops in<br>kagali were allowed to shoot and kill<br>dogs who were roaming the streets eating<br>bodies that were left on the streets so<br>they were allowed to shoot the dogs<br>eating the bodies but they were given<br>orders not to shoot at anyone who was<br>carrying out the killings<br>in<br>1995 uh the UN Security Council passed a<br>resolution establishing the<br>international criminal Tribunal for<br>Rwanda to try those most responsible for<br>the genocide in Rwanda and for crimes<br>against humanity and war<br>crimes it was decided to establish that<br>court in Aria<br>Tanzania um but a base uh in Rwanda was<br>needed along with the court in<br>Arusha as a result senior government<br>senior military officials and Senior<br>local officials were those primarily<br>charged other important figures uh in<br>the media responsible for the hate media<br>also were charged as were leading into a<br>harway and sadly also were a few Church<br>officials who had taken part in mass<br>killings at churches they were involved<br>in I was in involved in several of those<br>trials I led the prosecution of the<br>governor of Kali the capital um thases<br>Colonel thsis renzaho who had fled to<br>the Congo uh where he was<br>subsequently um arrested and<br>detained I also led the prosecution of<br>Father atanas<br>SBA who was the priest in charge of a<br>church at nangi<br>uh it was a parish where there were some<br>2,000 people who had sought refuge in<br>the<br>church over a period of days they were<br>surrounded by militia who were trying to<br>get in to attack them and they were able<br>to fend them off for a few days uh it<br>was then decided by uh several of the<br>communal leaders uh including father SBA<br>that the sh church should be<br>bulldozed uh and it was then<br>bulldozed uh and those who survived with<br>the church collapsing on them were<br>killed by the militia who came forward<br>as far as I'm aware only one<br>person survived um after the attack on<br>the<br>church there were 75 individuals brought<br>to trial at the ICT and 61 convicted<br>each and every one of those 75 who were<br>arrested and tried were arrested outside<br>of<br>Rwanda there is a debate as to whether<br>the cost of the tribunal was worth it<br>could it have been more<br>efficient<br>absolutely um many of the trials lasted<br>for years many defendants waited years<br>for their cases to be heard this is<br>wrong<br>there were however a lot of lessons<br>leared which have been to the benefit of<br>the international criminal<br>court and there have been case there's<br>been case law which I won't go through<br>in any great detail which has been<br>important case law um the first judgment<br>which was the called the akayesu<br>Judgment was the first uh to interpret<br>the definition of genocide as contained<br>in the genocide convention it also was<br>groundbreaking for its affirmation<br>of rape as an international<br>crime um and they finding that rape may<br>form the part of the act of<br>genocide it wasn't perfect justice but<br>to those who say it wasn't worth the<br>money I do pose the<br>question would it have been right for<br>those who are most responsible to go<br>unpunished for the evil that occurred in<br>Rwanda what message would that have sent<br>to leaders in the future who may<br>contemplate carrying out a<br>genocide that you can organize and kill<br>a million<br>people<br>have hundreds of thousands of people<br>it um I do believe that uh aspects of<br>Justice namely uh personal<br>accountability and deterence are<br>important um so that a community can<br>move on and<br>reconcile there are clearly many factors<br>that created the environment for the<br>genocide to happen and I've mentioned<br>some the hate<br>media the determination of an ethnic<br>Elite to monopolize<br>power Colonial history of divide and<br>Rule um there was also so extreme<br>poverty and for some people it was a<br>matter of taking someone's cow and land<br>poor<br>but also there had been impunity in the<br>past for those who had been responsible<br>for killings and I have no doubt that in<br>the minds of those who were leading the<br>country they thought they would be able<br>to get away with it this time as<br>well and if there hadn't been an<br>international tribunal all of them were<br>outside of Rwanda they may well have<br>it<br>so uh it was important that the world<br>Community made a stand to start saying<br>no to the impunity of leaders who were<br>responsible for these despicable crimes<br>the tribunal also created a historical<br>record<br>there are now many judgments as to what<br>took place in Rwanda and that it was a<br>genocide against the<br>tootsi that becomes important as with<br>time it seems that whenever there's been<br>a genocide throughout certainly uh<br>recent histories um as years go by there<br>will be those that who want to come<br>along and deny the fact it's important<br>to say no loudly and clearly to any who<br>may try to deny the fact that there was<br>genocide against the<br>totsy this has been established an<br>established fact in international Court<br>again um Hannah AR's book ikman and<br>Jerusalem a report on the banality of<br>evil was a report on Aman's<br>trial and it introduced the expression<br>and concept of banality of evil<br>her thesis was that ikan was actually<br>not a fanatic or a<br>sociopath but instead an average and<br>mundane<br>person banality in this sense doesn't<br>mean that Ian's actions were in any way<br>ordinary but that his actions were<br>motivated by a sort of complacency which<br>was wholly<br>unexceptional I was speaking to a<br>defense lawyer who had represented one<br>of the defendants at the<br>tribunal who<br>said it was really only by the end of<br>the trial after hearing all the evidence<br>that he came to understand why aent had<br>coined the term the banality of evil<br>almost all of the defendants at the ICT<br>were highly educated well<br>spoken um no doubt polite and if you sat<br>with them at a dinner table I imagine<br>you'd probably feel that you had a good<br>deal in common with most of<br>them fergo Kean who was a BBC<br>reporter U and one of the few reporters<br>who was in Rwanda during the uh the<br>jide um he had been in a number of<br>places but he'd been in bhari which was<br>the University Town in the south of<br>Rwanda he struggled with his feelings<br>from his time there he felt incredible<br>guilt for not being able to do more<br>having seen what was going on and<br>knowing what was going to happen to<br>filming he described bhari at the time<br>as a place consumed by evil which he<br>defined as a place with an absence of<br>humanity I personally think that there<br>was an absence of moral courage kindness<br>and<br>Humanity by<br>individuals but also by leadership<br>leadership of the country leadership of<br>the<br>church it appeared that some church<br>leaders uh had become too closely<br>aligned with the government in<br>power um the political leadership and<br>they failed to try and hold those<br>leaders uh accountable for their actions<br>as to what was<br>happening but I've often pondered when I<br>was listening to the<br>evidence how would I have<br>acted it's a question I think we could<br>all ask<br>ourselves I know how I would like to<br>acted but what I have shown in those<br>circumstances<br>the moral courage kindness and Humanity<br>needed to make a<br>difference certainly Central to the<br>Christian faith is the example of Christ<br>laying down his life for<br>others would I have done so if I was in<br>the place of those I was<br>Prosecuting did those parishioners who<br>are praying next to their neighbors at<br>nangi church at<br>Easter 1994<br>think that they were going to kill the<br>weeks I should add that some people did<br>make a difference and show extraordinary<br>moral<br>courage kindness in humanity one elderly<br>woman who was a witness whose evidence I<br>led uh described arriving at the St<br>Paul's Center in central<br>kagali she said she was met by an<br>Angel it was a Hu<br>priest someone she said who would have<br>died with us and for us despite that he<br>was hu the fact that he was hu and they<br>were<br>Tootsie many of the survivors were<br>remarkable in their willingness to<br>forgive I was speaking to dasas just<br>before and I was saying for many of them<br>they knew they weren't going to get<br>their loved ones<br>back um what they wanted more than any<br>long prison sentence for the defendants<br>was them to put up their hand and say<br>I'm<br>sorry sadly almost none of those charged<br>in Arusha did<br>so so whilst there were questions that I<br>asked myself of and of myself and of God<br>I didn't undergo any particular crisis<br>of Faith as a result of the work I was<br>involved in and the work of<br>reconciliation in Rwanda post genocide<br>which uh you will hear more about from<br>dasas um I suspect is remarkable given<br>the experiences that so many went<br>through uh many of the people living in<br>Rwanda are living examples of their<br>Faith and Action and the power of<br>forgiveness<br>thank<br>you thank you there will be a chance to<br>ask questions to both the speakers but<br>if there is any quick question to ask<br>Jonathan now uh let's go for that we'll<br>need a bit of clever work with the Mike<br>or I can just relay your question if<br>there no questions at this stage for<br>Jonathan that's absolutely fine there'll<br>be a chance to ask him questions after<br>we've heard from father dasas<br>in which case thank<br>you I'm delighted therefore to welcome<br>our second speaker father dasas kamman a<br>Catholic priest from Rwanda who's<br>currently undertaking his PhD I think<br>he's in the last year here at atago in<br>the National Center for peace and<br>conflict<br>studies his extensive experience with<br>Nos and Civil Society including being<br>co-founder at the Africa Center for<br>strategy and policy and a green faith<br>program fellow in<br>2019 his LinkedIn profile reflects his<br>International Outlook listing 10<br>languages his master's thesis completed<br>at American University in 2018 was on<br>the subject reconciliation and peace<br>building for Catholic Church's mission<br>in post genocide Rwanda so it just<br>seemed too good an opportunity in what<br>may well be uh did's last year with us<br>to invite him to speak to us this<br>evening uh taking up the challenges of<br>reconciliation in his home country of<br>you thank you David to giving me a<br>opportunity and<br>Jonathan so I just want to start by what<br>Jonathan was talking about Hanah aren so<br>we are talking about<br>genocide why it<br>happened what happened how people can go<br>far to commit genocide so I want also to<br>reflect in the Book of James War he<br>wrote becoming evil how Ordinary People<br>can commit Mass killing and genocide and<br>for James is Ordinary People is me is<br>you he you know<br>those who committed the genocide were<br>good<br>parents they were as you said they were<br>smart they were lawyers they were<br>readers but they committed extraordinary<br>evil so when we are reflecting on this<br>commemoration of R genocide I am capable<br>to commit genocide as you can be capable<br>to<br>commit evil so it's why we have to when<br>we commemorate we have to be reminded<br>that we can have human<br>failure and Faith<br>failure so the this is<br>Rwanda far away from New<br>Zealand yeah so but Rwanda became<br>popular because of not because we did<br>well but because we made extraordinary<br>evil and why we have to reflect to say<br>never<br>again so<br>the I want to reflect on reconciliation<br>towards peace unity and forgiveness in<br>Rwanda<br>reconciliation so<br>the my reflection will reflect on<br>reconciliation the brief history you<br>already said this how they will major<br>people's knows and and crucify<br>people and I I would not talk about that<br>but I will just reflect<br>on genocide happened what next to wance<br>International tribunal court for Randa<br>was set up some legal framework was set<br>up to me it's not<br>enough how<br>individuals and communities and<br>families both from victims and<br>perpetrators can rebuild again their<br>lives joh red talks about reconciliation<br>he just defined reconciliation<br>as restoration of broken<br>relationships where you you call people<br>to come together family communities and<br>then to create a new shared experience<br>and perception so I think I will reflect<br>on three levels of<br>reconciliation one is political<br>reconciliation which the government set<br>up some policies the people can long can<br>start some efforts for reconciliation<br>and then I will go for individuals<br>reconciliation and then I will go for<br>interpersonal<br>reconciliation yeah so the fora after<br>the genocide we had no<br>choice we had no choice neighbors killed<br>the<br>neighbors family members killed each<br>other coworkers killed each other<br>leaders killed their their own people<br>so there were no choice and to live<br>together and then you have the same you<br>are sending your kids to the same school<br>you are attending the same church you<br>are going to the same Hospital even if<br>you seem to be enemies there is no<br>choice unless you<br>reconcile and you forgive each other so<br>it's why I say peace and unity and<br>forgiveness whatever process was as more<br>imagination<br>when you commit a crime and you commit<br>that extraordinary evil<br>afterwards you have that dream of moral<br>imagination you dream howand could look<br>like and then I think both perpetrators<br>and victims are having that more IM<br>imagination where you want to be in the<br>next<br>Society yeah so government may put<br>policies and<br>initiatives but<br>everybody victims perpetrators are<br>having moral imagination so it's why I'm<br>reflecting personal<br>level how someone who committed genocide<br>or his<br>Families how victims survivors of<br>genocide imagine to<br>live as we reflect on Christian Life uh<br>survivors<br>they blame themselves why am I<br>survived and then they blame God why did<br>you allow this to<br>happen and then they blame their victims<br>why did you why do why do you did why<br>did you do this to me all those are<br>blames you blame yourself you blame God<br>and then you blame other you blame even<br>your own history and your<br>country why am white wonder why I was<br>born this country country of killing so<br>then reconciliation will be also a<br>personal process where you accept<br>yourself you can you forgive yourself<br>then you forgive<br>God and then you can forgive your<br>neighbor so this personal everyday<br>forgiveness as I show this is<br>a some coffee people are working<br>together everyday life the people can<br>reach the level of forgiveness<br>it's good the government can put some<br>policies as we had gacha courts gacha<br>courts set up by the government to help<br>people in the communities to<br>witness and have apology and<br>forgiveness but also comes from<br>individuals taking initiative to say I<br>did wrong this is not fair I want to<br>leave forgive and apologize and then<br>live my<br>life the<br>so we International International tribun<br>has Law and then as we say the tribu of<br>Justice you put someone in the jail or<br>he paid some amend whatever but it's not<br>enough you need also to think what is<br>next in your rebuilding your broken<br>relationships but I'm not denying that<br>justice has to happen accountability has<br>to happen but personal process for for<br>healing someone may die without seeing<br>justice as you said some folks are we<br>still looking for them some people died<br>without seeing justice but you canot you<br>can die or already forgive someone even<br>if you don't see Justice you can forgive<br>someone yeah so these are the political<br>efforts of<br>Rwanda we had gacha courts which helped<br>communities at least people witness they<br>say we saw you doing this or you saved<br>someone's life and have build again<br>Society without<br>mistrust gacha really did a lot of<br>work and helped people at least to go to<br>their small villages and tell the truth<br>of what<br>happened and then the count the<br>government polic also wanted to build a<br>national identity so we had identity<br>the government said no wrong no way no<br>ID with your ethnic groups we have an ID<br>as R like a government have a poli to<br>create a national identity now we say<br>what we Calla means I'm<br>randan and uh when Jonathan was talking<br>about that<br>church where the priest ordered that the<br>church can be destroyed and then kill<br>people<br>the few years later after the genocide<br>some people came telling student in high<br>school to separate themselves divided<br>according to ethnics groups the student<br>in high school said no we are<br>Rand and then the killers shoot all<br>those<br>students at least it was a witness to<br>refuse<br>divisions even if they were killed but<br>they witnessed that we want to be one we<br>had experience of Divisions now we are<br>one even if you want us to be divided we<br>can't arow you to divide us so the<br>fruits<br>of policies which leads people to be<br>United is important because even if we<br>think about the church working you have<br>to have a policy set up at least helping<br>people be willing to unite and<br>reconcile but the the the political<br>reconciliation is not enough you have to<br>engage your religious leaders Cil<br>Society institutions and engaging<br>individuals so we had these are<br>prisoners so but we we have Many<br>religious leaders going into prison<br>teaching<br>prisoners at least to amend themselves<br>and tell the truth and that's eort was<br>really important and still faith-based<br>organizations and Civil Society going<br>into prison and teach prisoners was<br>really a huge contribution to society<br>and again the country like<br>Randa many school belongs to religious<br>institutions Health Service and social<br>services are headed by religious<br>institutions as a government we can't<br>work without working with religious<br>leaders and I would think the good job<br>the government and religious faith-based<br>organizations they really worked hand in<br>hand to make sure they will rebuild<br>again the society<br>uh another reflection I want to do is to<br>reflect on Bob<br>shrier Robert sh was my supervisor when<br>I was doing my masters in Theology and<br>he worked very hard about<br>reconciliation for him he reflects on<br>how reconciliation is a<br>narrative which talks about<br>oppressor oppressor Humanity offenders<br>Humanity rather than also looking at<br>action as Christian you know we separate<br>Sinner and sin so sometime we say even<br>if he did wrong he's a human being he<br>can change for good even if he yeah<br>that's really to look at oppressors also<br>Humanity it's why the prison ministry<br>was really a huge contribution in<br>reconciliation you are not only<br>rejecting these people in prison<br>thinking they are evil and forget to go<br>and tell them you are human being you<br>did wrong please change and become a<br>normal person that was amazing to the<br>government to work with religious<br>leaders at least in this reconciliation<br>process and uh these are questions I'm<br>reflecting on forgiveness not forgetting<br>because many people confuse forgiveness<br>and<br>forgetting if you forget if you don't<br>remember you are<br>minimizing the the horrible or you are<br>denying your own<br>history now as you said Jonathan now we<br>are struggling with genocide<br>denial there are so many views say we<br>had double genocide or triple genocide<br>or whatever but it's clear that radio<br>was talking about toot the people were<br>making polic to kill toot you can't deny<br>that genocide against the toot so<br>genocide deny is the last step when you<br>deny you justify why you killed the<br>people yeah so how can R forgive not<br>forgetting because genocide will be the<br>part of our history no way we remember<br>to unite to heal to reconcile and<br>forgive how there is as thison Tut said<br>there is no no no future without<br>forgiveness so we forgive ourselves we<br>forgive God we forgive our perpetrators<br>we forgive our history and then we look<br>for the future and many rans did uh and<br>then what will be meaning for never<br>again in Rwanda and for<br>Rand never again is to live again in<br>Harmony in unity in forgiveness and<br>Reconciliation and unfortunately the<br>word never again have<br>been minimized because we say never<br>again genocide is happening in different<br>corners of our<br>grob and then we watch and then<br>afterwards we forgot we say never again<br>never again it happened but we say never<br>again so we need also the genocide<br>against the TR in<br>Randa is a reminder for all of us to<br>know what happened to Randa can happen<br>to New Zealand can happen to any place<br>of the world when there is divisive<br>ideologies and racism and<br>divisions and then how do or do rans<br>rebuild their hope and<br>resilience is that everyday life healing<br>and forgiveness and peace at personal<br>level interpersonal level Community<br>level and then National level yeah yeah<br>so I I think my presentation is here<br>it's short if you like to have some<br>question we discuss thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
