In this lecture, he traces key contacts throughout his career, considers the provenancing of materials and the behaviour of chemical sensors in terms of this generalised principle, and covers some of our research on trace evidence in forensic science.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>tooto my name is John hosking I'm the D<br>of science here at the University of<br>walk by Papa it's my very great pleasure<br>to welcome you both to the university<br>and the enal lecture of Professor Gordon<br>Skelly Gordon's a chemist has worked<br>across a variety of areas including<br>coordination chemistry<br>electrochemistry Material Science<br>forensic science and environmental<br>chemistry illust major contributions as<br>being the areas of course<br>and Optical senses surface complexation<br>on iron oxides both relatively<br>straightforward for chemist then we come<br>to his additional major contribution of<br>the analysis and decontamination of<br>elicit drugs is this a Breaking Bad<br>moment was Gordon attempting to fund his<br>research and lifestyle in illicit<br>ways actually the cond is more of a go a<br>geke keeper than a poacher it relates to<br>his on fascination with forensic science<br>which is going to tell us more about<br>tonight Hon's not only a very good<br>chemist he's a very good leader he led<br>the school of chemical Sciences not only<br>through a set of internal CH challenges<br>and cultural changes but also through Co<br>Gordon along with others convinced me as<br>Dean that Co was just another health and<br>safety<br>issue and they we're pretty good at<br>dealing with them on a regular basis so<br>why shouldn't we app similar mitigation<br>measures and deal and approach uh Co in<br>a business's usual way and that's what<br>we did our chemistry research labs and<br>other labs in faculty contined to<br>operate in increasingly less restricted<br>fashion maintaining research<br>productivity while avoiding Co cross<br>infection list and other successes such<br>as the move to on the online equal<br>detection Labs I'm deeply indebted to<br>Gordon for the leadership CH throughout<br>the that<br>period Gord undertook his honors and PD<br>in chemistry ATO before postto at<br>Stanford and Caltech and an assistant<br>professorship at USC for being lured to<br>ockland to teach in analytical chemistry<br>and on the new forensic science<br>program bordon also has other strings to<br>his bow for many years he's presented<br>the chemistry magic show might get some<br>of that tonight a sellout of incredible<br>science Waring buding young scientists<br>encouraging them to consider chemistry<br>for their future<br>studies he also walk the length of New<br>Zealand just for something to do he says<br>te I also on reliable Authority that he<br>electrochemically turned lead into gold<br>in his PhD PES<br>this was an early example of the<br>entrepreneurial behavior that led to his<br>Breaking Bad<br>discoveries if he has indeed discovered<br>the floss of the stone I think he owes<br>us an<br>explanation and a<br>dividend Lord the floor is<br>alen couple of disclaimers first um I am<br>not a forensic<br>scientist um and I'll explain why in a<br>moment and my colleague Bruno frzy tells<br>me I'm not a real analytical<br>chemist and yet I teach analytical<br>chemistry I teach in the forensic<br>science program and my students go out<br>and get analytical chemistry jobs and<br>environmental science jobs and forensic<br>science jobs how does that come about<br>I guess one other disclaimer I say just<br>in case anyone was wondering maybe I'm<br>going to be talking about birds that's<br>Skelly so what I'm going to do first is<br>just um talk a little bit about the<br>title that I chose primarily because I<br>told the title to a senior forensic<br>scientist that I respect a great deal a<br>couple of weeks ago and his sole<br>response was well that that's not very<br>original because it's sort of like<br>Newton's laws to forensic scientists<br>they they probably learn it in their<br>first lecture this concept of um they<br>put it uh down every contact U makes a<br>trace um comes from uh Edmund loar I put<br>this in the abstract but I've put up<br>there again I'm not going to read it you<br>can read that um what I will point out<br>though is that I've had a bit of an<br>interest in this um topic for a while<br>and back in 20<br>9 I gave actually a student who's uh in<br>here now um this is a research essay<br>topic so we give them these topics<br>beginning of the year go go and read all<br>you can about this and write me an essay<br>and they come back at the end of the<br>year um so mine was there's two versions<br>of low card's exchange principle and I<br>told him to investigate modern studies<br>of contact at the microscale and<br>nanoscale including tribology so uh<br>friction and rubbing of surface<br>and microbial contamination transfer<br>that indicate the occurrence and in<br>extent of transfers upon contact so that<br>was the start of<br>2019 what happened at the end of<br>2019 suddenly all of you became experts<br>in contact and transfer although you<br>were using transfer in a different sense<br>to the way that forensic scientists use<br>so you sort of knew something about well<br>contact is when we're close to um to<br>someone maybe um but it doesn't actually<br>have to be immediate proximity right<br>they can just sneeze nearby if it's<br>something you saw and indeed it doesn't<br>even have to be<br>exactly uh the same time right you could<br>come in shortly afterwards so you know<br>contact then has a it's it's more to say<br>proximity now there's a little bit more<br>in there um I think that are actually<br>some cases now where we can show that<br>you can have two things come in contact<br>and there's not a transfer but it's a<br>very very special sort of um sort of<br>case at the Nano scale so there's a<br>little bit um more depth there but I<br>want to come up sort of to the the macro<br>scale and say that that principle<br>actually is is part of a chain so when a<br>forensic scientist is is think about<br>that principle while thinking that<br>something's come into contact or<br>proximity<br>there's been some sort of exchange<br>someone's maybe broken glass that's<br>filling on them or there's a DNA<br>exchange or there's a fingerprint<br>something there's been a<br>transfer then they rely on the the being<br>persistent that thing has got to last<br>long enough that some BDI forensic<br>scientist come along or policemen comes<br>along go aha there's something<br>interesting so they've detected it then<br>it's not that valuable really until you<br>put some meaning to it and in the<br>forensic context that could mean some<br>extra information it could mean for<br>example that you needed to know<br>something about How likely it is to find<br>glass fragments on random man so any one<br>of you for<br>example so that's the forensic science<br>version but I've also been exposed to<br>environmental science and that's the<br>middle that you um Trace that you're<br>seeing there and they talk about well<br>we've got a source it then has pathways<br>through the environment to some sort of<br>Target once again then got that<br>detection and meaning and so if someone<br>tracking down a contaminant might go and<br>look at a Target and go okay this<br>animal's suffering or it's got this<br>amount of chemical in it where did that<br>come from so we're starting to see that<br>progression of we found something let's<br>trace it back why is it there what's it<br>telling us it's telling a<br>story and finally I'll sometimes be<br>talking about<br>provenancing so let's say someone gives<br>you a bottle of wine it's got a label on<br>it how do you know that that wine that<br>says malra on it actually came from<br>malra once again possibly there could be<br>something in its composition the<br>chemicals the elements whatever else<br>that survived right through the wine<br>making the processing there to that<br>bottle of wine once again you analyze<br>the wine hopefully it's telling you a<br>story of where it came from so Bruno<br>maybe I'm not an analytical chemist in<br>the sense that you say it because I'm an<br>analytical chemist in the sense of a<br>Storyteller<br>okay so now let's tell the<br>story of how I got to be here and quite<br>often at these inaugural lecturas we we<br>start at grandparents you know don't<br>want to go too far back um so on the<br>left here we've got my um my father's<br>parents so my um grandfather on that<br>side was a primary school teacher at<br>tiny little country schools around the<br>North nor<br>Ireland um he my father was an only<br>child I can't find any photographs of<br>them when he was at sort of over<br>teenage um all three together I guess<br>someone had to be holding the<br>camera um the picture on the other side<br>is my mother's family which you can see<br>is much much<br>bigger um so my grandfather up here uh<br>was a dairy small scale Dairy Farmer on<br>the Coro peninsula<br>um obviously this is my grandmother down<br>here um spent time bringing up that<br>large family and also had a very large<br>um Garden so that they could<br>um do a lot of um subsistence um<br>vegetable growing and a large um flower<br>garden as well so my mother is the<br>oldest she's down here um if you have a<br>look there's quite a range in the of<br>Ages in the family it's because it's one<br>of those families that was split by<br>World War II so the oldest three were<br>born before World War II the youngest<br>three after um so this was the next one<br>Mark um unfortunat he went to the<br>Vietnam War but unfortunately died in a<br>car accident when I was very young um<br>Tom here took over the family farm<br>eventually um Rusty was an accountant<br>and these two ended up being Secondary<br>School teachers so you can sort of start<br>to to hear a theme there um the plus one<br>in this photo that's my dad um so he was<br>good friends with Tom the one who ended<br>up being a farmer and that's how he met<br>up with my mother um and they remained<br>best friends um through their their<br>lives and Dad regarded this as his<br>second family and you'll see a<br>consequence of that shortly so a little<br>bit about these two then so as I said my<br>grandfather was going around these<br>little towns so when it came time to<br>college dad um B Ed with a family in<br>near dargaville and went to dargaville<br>high school mom went to Epsom girls um<br>high school until her final year when<br>her mother had the youngest boy and they<br>were both quite ill so she um went home<br>and uh studied by corresponden for that<br>last year and occasionally though she'd<br>remind us that she got slightly better<br>grades in University entrance than my<br>dad did even though he's the one who<br>went on to become an<br>engineer um so Mom trained to be a nurse<br>so that's why she was in Oakland dad um<br>did an apprenticeship and then went into<br>engineering once um he' qualified uh<br>they got married and as people often did<br>then they did an OE dad went over to<br>Glad go to the um heavy um engineering<br>workshops there and as we sort of say to<br>ourselves and the family they have cold<br>nights in Scotland so they came back<br>with three children um<br>so what I'm showing up um in the top<br>left there is my sister and me sitting<br>on the steps of a where we lived in<br>kirilik just out of Glasgow I remember<br>nothing of that we we moved back when I<br>was was<br>three um but we initially moved to to<br>Christ Church and I've chosen this<br>particular picture for two<br>reasons one is that it um shows our um<br>age distribution far better than most<br>others we're about two years apart so<br>my sister Shir is the oldest then me<br>then um Colin and then<br>Murray um but we're all on a climbing<br>frame that my father the engineer has<br>welded together so it's really practical<br>person we also had a quite big swing set<br>he built<br>garage I inherited none of that through<br>nature or nurture which was a source of<br>frustration both to me and my<br>father um but as I said my mother had<br>come from this Farm my father regarded<br>as his second uh family and so we spent<br>a lot of<br>time uh at the Family Farm which s had<br>dairy cattle it's you know kind of that<br>what people now probably think of as as<br>as the dream right it's right by the<br>beach and we could go out and go fishing<br>um great times there um and later<br>actually um when I got my first job um<br>outside my direct family it was with my<br>uncle who'd just gone hay Contracting so<br>I drove a track<br>um spreading the hay while he was doing<br>the bailing and you know how New<br>Zealand's a really really small<br>country um well Neil Cully our um wine<br>maker um comes from kandal and two years<br>after I did that job for my uncle he<br>uncle so moving on um quite a bit this<br>is perhaps um showing it's one of my<br>favorite photographs of my um parents<br>some of you might recognize that a bit<br>more from uh from this picture um he's<br>he was a really social person loved<br>having um the family around that's all<br>his grandchildren around him um you see<br>it's quite dated and some of them have<br>grown up quite a lot so I've put in a<br>more recent photograph um as well so uh<br>eventually dad um became manager of an<br>engineering Workshop um but was also<br>very involved in um engineering New<br>Zealand so the Professional Organization<br>of Engineers and um I makei and as a<br>result of that um he um was on the<br>Staffing Committee of the faculty of<br>engineering for years and years and<br>years um he also was in rotary with the<br>fathers of um two very young professors<br>at Massie University so about this time<br>of year he would usually be reminding me<br>that it would be a really good idea to<br>apply for promotion sometime um<br>unfortunately he died in October last<br>year so didn't actually see that got<br>this far um so mom um once we went to um<br>School became um an an office manager<br>and eventually uh co-director of the<br>company that Dad was at and then they<br>both had very active um lives after<br>retirement she was a a guide out at uh<br>territory uh was was her main uh<br>enjoyment and then unfortunately she<br>passed away about 3 years ago um so our<br>new version of our family is shown on<br>the bottom here<br>um and we're sort of glad that we<br>finally had a happy occasion rather than<br>than funerals um and so I just point out<br>here if I can find my arrow this is um<br>my sister so she's a primary school<br>teacher and then principal now in maths<br>educator um this is my brother who's a<br>curat Colin who's a curator at tap Papa<br>U Museum um and somewhere here if I can<br>move this this is my youngest brother<br>Murray who's currently a um pilot with<br>uh a New Zealand and I thank him I<br>should have said this earlier um for<br>coming along tonight along with his wife<br>Carol and two daughters Jamie and of<br>course many of you know Michaela down<br>here um and so here we've got uh<br>Michaela here and this is the new newest<br>member of our family who some of you um<br>might know this is um Tess or Theresa<br>feon who was one of the first science<br>Scholars<br>um uh and is now doctor Teresa so you<br>know one of those stress things of do<br>your PhD or or get married within about<br>a two-month period but she did both of<br>them well um and then one so most of us<br>live in the North Ireland spread over<br>there we've got um my sister's um eldest<br>daughter lives in in<br>Canada so back to my story um so the<br>school years started off down in Christ<br>church and then moved up um to how where<br>I uh went through everything else apart<br>from scoring it doesn't say there but I<br>was very involved in in scouting um all<br>the rest on this is talking about my um<br>time at panger college so I used to be a<br>very good boy<br>soprano and when I was in Intermediate<br>School I sang in um Oliver um it was how<br>at Little Theater and the music teacher<br>at the P at the peering College heard me<br>came up afterwards and said are you<br>coming to pearing college next year I<br>said yes he said cool where running an<br>opera with you as The Soloist um so this<br>is this was the third time he did this<br>whenever he came across a boy soprano<br>that was good enough he he' put on this<br>opera called Amile and the Night<br>Visitors and if any of you know of it<br>yes I could sing the high note um also<br>when we talk about breaking barriers I<br>was the first male in um the school's<br>magical choir which is an un<br>unaccompanied um choir following year<br>there were a couple of um other um males<br>joined and I think many years later my<br>brother was actually um in that um I<br>played the viola but not very well well<br>enough to be in an orchestra but not a<br>solo that's the way I put it um and I<br>played soccer and Cricket again not very<br>well but I was the kind of kid who who'<br>enjoyed those things um now having said<br>that that soccer in some way probably<br>made me move towards chemistry rather<br>than<br>physics so in<br>the so the first 11 and the second 11<br>would sometimes practice together and it<br>would usually be in the evening and we<br>didn't have flood light so one day I<br>went up to hid the ball against the best<br>player in the first 11 and came off<br>second best so I woke up on the ground<br>with a blood nose and when I moved it it<br>went crackle crackle um so I had what's<br>called an eggshell fracture so I had to<br>go to hospital and get it fixed under<br>General um and then have one of those um<br>nose masks kind of like what mbae had um<br>at the start before he got that fancy<br>one um which is really embarrassing for<br>a teenager and so my parents and teach<br>teachers took pity on me and said okay<br>it's two weeks till the end of the<br>semester you don't have to come to<br>school um for that time you can study at<br>home and my chemistry teacher gave me<br>this book called vogel's textbook of<br>practical organic<br>chemistry which had these really cool<br>pictures of stuff you just did not see<br>in in secondary school and it talked<br>about these really cool reactions that<br>you could do all these manipulations<br>that would talk through all the<br>descriptions it was just you can make<br>stuff with<br>chemistry<br>um and and so I I started um faing that<br>now those of you who um recognize old<br>things might recognize that thing on the<br>right is a book plate and so you can see<br>I was stck of school so pretty smart um<br>but there's evidence that I was not yet<br>a critical thinker<br>because that book plate is inside a book<br>that is called um Without a Trace more<br>Triangle so we'll see later where I<br>might have learned some of my critical<br>thinking um so I went down to University<br>of oo and based on the grades that I'd<br>got uh in scholarship exams was allowed<br>directly into second year and back then<br>there you you then therefore completely<br>forgot your first year you just did<br>second third um fourth fourth year so it<br>was a quick way of going through um and<br>I did almost all chemistry papers I did<br>two physics papers and one maths paper<br>so pretty pretty focused on thing um so<br>great I'm going into this and I got to<br>the end of my first semester and uh in<br>physical chemistry which uh the honors<br>class was taught separately by this<br>really energetic person I got<br>19% I'd never failed an exam in my life<br>and there was<br>19% um and the reason was that we didn't<br>have sheets or anything it was talk<br>about energy and you can see these un R<br>underlined equations here we had to<br>remember those and be using those and it<br>ended up when I was on the test they<br>were just L letter salad right so I<br>couldn't remember which was the U's<br>which was the minuses um and so I the<br>elector called me in and he said I know<br>you can do better than this didn't<br>actually tell me how so I went to um<br>I went to my there was another person in<br>my hostel who was in the same year and I<br>said what do you do to study cuz I'd<br>never built study schools at school and<br>he said well I write out all my notes<br>neatly cool I'll do that um so what<br>that's what I did because I didn't know<br>any better and I did a few pneumonics<br>and of course I did all the problems and<br>fortunately back in those days your<br>final grade was completely dependent on<br>your exam and so I was top of the class<br>at the end of the year and after that as<br>well um but it was a a bit of a shock on<br>the way I got um had the opportunity to<br>do two chemistry related jobs so the<br>first one uh was um making up new<br>explosives at um<br>ICI uh mainly it was in the lab but<br>occasionally once I got to to go out to<br>an old abandoned um Quarry we would blow<br>up these 4 ler cans of um explosive and<br>what and the physicists would look at<br>the the bubble coming up to get<br>information about what was going on uh I<br>was the unskilled person so my job was<br>to wire the electric detonators into the<br>firing<br>circuit um and then I had a job at uh<br>plant and food back then it was dsir um<br>it's my only natural ever natural<br>products um project looking at a<br>molecule that was in Fruit<br>Rod<br>um so I did my honors and PhD in this<br>the same research group um with with a<br>really um able and bright um Professor<br>named David Buckingham um for those of<br>you of the chemists sometimes he'd have<br>to say he's the other David Buckingham<br>there was a physical chemist one and an<br>inorganic chemist one um he was a<br>professor he' just arrived um at the<br>University of Oto professors back in<br>those days were kept pretty busy doing<br>things so um he had a research fellow<br>named Charles Clark who was actually the<br>person who taught us a lot of the skills<br>but annoyingly you know if we were<br>trying to crystallize something and<br>we're having trouble with it Dave would<br>just come wandering<br>in maybe add something look at it and it<br>would crystallize telling the truth<br>right<br>on<br>um so there were a couple of others in<br>that group who are influential Roy tasa<br>some of you may know know that name he's<br>a chemical educator um and so he'd<br>started uh before me um and had set up<br>um tutorials at a couple of the hosts<br>and so when he left he gave gave them to<br>me I guess you could say it like that so<br>that was my first chance at teaching<br>outside a<br>laboratory and couple of others so David<br>fi was the uh that Mentor I had uh<br>undergraduate who who said we we think<br>you can do better um he also uh we<br>co-authored my first paper which was<br>actually in chemical history and then<br>Wayne webbley here was I think two years<br>ahead of me in PhD um sco in<br>electrochemistry and in um<br>simul computer simulation so I learned a<br>lot of that from<br>him so here's me doing experiments um<br>bottom one just for your information<br>there's no one else in that room um we<br>would get that instrument you can see me<br>on for maybe 48 hours every 3 weeks and<br>you would just use it that whole time um<br>I would be doing runs where they take<br>about an hour between me having to<br>reaction which I'd get a little bit<br>bored so I've set up my camera and I've<br>done um timelapse um pictures there I<br>know it was about 11:00 p.m. because at<br>about the same time I turned it and took<br>a picture of the uh University of otago<br>Clock Tower and it's showing the the<br>time of<br>11:00 um so what did I do on my PhD two<br>completely different subjects one of<br>them I'm not even going to tell you<br>about it was having five compounds here<br>that depending on the situation would<br>intercon convert and I spent all my time<br>looking in detail of those and how they<br>went to give you an idea of the impact<br>that that research has had it my mosts<br>sited paper from that has had nine<br>citations five of which are from that<br>research<br>group at the end of of that my PhD<br>supervisor actually said get out of this<br>field right you need to find a field<br>that's um more impactful which I did the<br>other one had had more impact um and so<br>porin are a class of of molecules this<br>is sort of picture I've got here if you<br>can see that there's a ring here and<br>there's a little metal or something in<br>the middle of it so they're real they're<br>really St stable molecules that hold<br>Metals in the middle really strongly um<br>these are what is holding the oxygen in<br>your blood in hemoglobin um a related<br>one is in chlorophyll so that you also<br>might sense from that that they're<br>really strongly colored and you're going<br>to see them appearing again and again so<br>we're looking at some fundamental<br>chemistry of those at that<br>time so I took my supervisor device I<br>changed topics completely um the reason<br>I went to stand of Stanford and keltech<br>is that I went to Stanford and my boss<br>moved to keltech so we all moved with<br>him um and I was doing a field called<br>photo electric chemistry which if you<br>break that down you're shining light on<br>something and it's generating an<br>electrical current and it's doing some<br>chemistry and we're just looking at ways<br>of doing that um stably and quickly also<br>in those very early days um looking at<br>binding of carbon dioxide so people<br>cared about carbon dioxide way back then<br>um still don't have the answers to uh to<br>that fully but people are still citing<br>that paper so that's okay um but that's<br>not what people remember my postto for<br>so my postto was about three year uh<br>three years long and what everyone<br>remembers is the last four months of it<br>um because that's when cold fusion<br>happened so um couple of chemists at<br>Utah said you can just do electric<br>chemistry and have Fusion happening and<br>so these two guys on the right hand I<br>said this is cool we could try that um<br>so came into the lab the next day that's<br>a handdrawn radiation sign set up the<br>lab uh at at the experiment fortunately<br>it didn't work because otherwise<br>something bad might have happened to<br>those people but that gung-ho attitude<br>has done them well the one on the left<br>Mike sailor is a um professor at the<br>University of California San Diego one<br>on the right University of California<br>Irvine um I sort of hung back at that<br>stage but after a while um<br>we we engaged with the physicists who<br>had uh sensitive Neutron detectors and<br>we needed to build up lots and lots of<br>cells because it seemed like it<br>irreproducible so here you can see me<br>soldering together a whole lot of of<br>cells that we were going to be putting<br>into a neutron counter um don't ask me<br>to do soldering I'm not very good at it<br>but but I was good at it enough the and<br>just a comment here I've labeled Gail<br>she's not actually on here but she was U<br>really intelligent she was our resident<br>laser jock so she was building a Pico<br>second laser system at that time um and<br>she was the first environmentalist true<br>environmentalist that I um ever met up<br>with so she'd cycle everywhere conserve<br>water and when she finished her um PhD<br>in postto became an advocate for um<br>clean air and cycling in New Mexico so<br>Mike Gail and I were were very close<br>friends kept close friends unfortunately<br>um Gail um died from cancer about 10<br>years<br>ago so my first job I was at University<br>of Southern California um see I'm all<br>happy to be in our new lab of my own um<br>so if you look at that I was doing some<br>synthesis the funny box boxes there show<br>I'm doing some electrochemistry I'm not<br>going to say what I was doing there it<br>was a electric catalysis um and these<br>are my two first two PhD students and<br>Ros is now a um chemical educator um and<br>administrator at Stetson University in<br>the<br>US um<br>so a few things happened um here one<br>thing that happened is um in about my<br>third year they said it's your turn to<br>teach the analytical chemistry course so<br>we had one in the program and so I<br>taught that which meant two years later<br>when the University of Oakland<br>advertised for an analytical chemist I<br>could be honestly say I have taught<br>analytical<br>chemistry even though uh really I was an<br>inorganic chemist the other thing that<br>happened was that I was teaching first<br>year and as some of you know when you're<br>trying to get over some of the chemical<br>Concepts in in first year chemistry you<br>do chemical<br>demonstrations and we had this<br>technician named Frank who you would<br>look in the book of demonstrations<br>contact him and say Frank I want E7 in<br>the lecture theater and you'd turn up<br>there and there it was so one day I<br>tuned up I said I want a hydrogen<br>balloon I'm not sure actually it might<br>have even been a hydrogen balloon with a<br>little bit of air on it they make bigger<br>bangs so I come in there's the balloon<br>floating about here matches candle<br>no yard stick it's the US what can I do<br>boom a little bit Deen this year I can<br>smell a bit of hair so I rub just to<br>make sure<br>that go on with the lecture few days or<br>maybe the next<br>week um we're talking again about um<br>energy and I wanted to talk about<br>catalysis and so we had a demonstration<br>that had some hydron peroxide really<br>strong<br>oxidant um and what we like to do with<br>it is right stable right now but if we<br>add a catalyst it can decompose or it<br>can do oxidations and so these days if<br>I'm doing<br>this sometimes add a little bit<br>of detergent little bit of<br>catalyst let that<br>go did a slightly different version of<br>this go in the um<br>in the lecture we did it in a conical<br>flask with more hydrogen peroxide and a<br>different catalyst so I put in the<br>Catalyst shook it and nothing<br>happened so I got another scoop of<br>catalyst put it in and it<br>erupted and I could feel this warm<br>liquid raining down on my head and<br>shoulders so I knew that there was a<br>bathroom it's America so I used the<br>euphemism up the back so I race up out<br>run rinse my face in here in the uh<br>Basin tellw myself off as much as<br>possible come back into the lecture<br>theater quietest lecture theater I have<br>ever um been in you know if you think<br>you know in an exam or a test it's quite<br>it's not right cuz they're writing this<br>was<br>quiet come up the front give the the<br>rest of the lecture thinking these<br>students are going to remember<br>catalysis 2 days later I get a summon<br>from from the head of<br>school and he says a deputation of your<br>first year students came and um th<br>worried you're not going to survive the<br>semester so what do you do you know<br>could CH back in those days you couldn't<br>really choose to go to YouTube because<br>it didn't exist so I decided that what I<br>do from then on is make sure that I<br>practice demos at scale before doing<br>them um in shows which means if you've<br>ever seen my magic shows and it looks<br>like it's a little bit out of control<br>it's an act<br>almost<br>always right um other key thing that<br>happened then is I met up with my wife<br>Denise who is uh here today as well um<br>and we met through our mutual like of um<br>hiking um because I didn't have a um a<br>car I biked or bused uh across uh La um<br>and so we we we headed<br>off um we got married and almost<br>immediately I said I have a job offer in<br>in New<br>Zealand um and so she very gamely um<br>came along um and as you might have seen<br>from the abstract um we we also have a<br>liking of cats this is the most recent<br>version two you can just make out one of<br>them um that you may have seen flashing<br>across Zoom screens over the last couple<br>of<br>years so 1995 um I came here and Brian<br>Davis was the head who hired me he was<br>also the chemical magician here and the<br>year after afterwards he retired and he<br>retired from being chemical magician and<br>he gave me a box of chemicals only used<br>for chemical magic that included<br>luminor um so um Douglas Russell and I<br>volunteered to to take over and here<br>we're demonstrating the proper way to<br>lead off a hydrogen balloon um and that<br>was such big news you can see that it<br>featured in the University<br>news<br>uh now at in the initial ones we did<br>fireworks is a finale but when we<br>started doing like three shows in a day<br>you couldn't clear the room of of the<br>smoke so we switched to doing um<br>cornstarch slurry since I jumped from a<br>chair into it and about 3 years ago um I<br>was getting set up to do that and I<br>thought I could hurt myself doing this<br>so I got a young audience member I think<br>the age of forarts in here about his age<br>um to to jump on instead but I thought<br>at that time it's probably time that I<br>stopped doing these magic shows I should<br>hand hand it on<br>um so also because I was doing that I<br>think the faculty asked me and uh<br>Jullian Lewis to be uh on on TV doing a<br>signment on morning TV about<br>science so I got hired as an analytical<br>chemist I got here and really didn't<br>know that much about analytical<br>chemistry um so really um technician<br>Glenn boy and Bruce grigor whose picture<br>I couldn't find taught me uh the<br>Practical aspects of analytical<br>chemistry and I've just put up there as<br>a sort of a snowball effect the others<br>who have um being in in the uh program<br>with<br>us so when I first came we had a school<br>of environmental Marine Science and out<br>at Tamaki and my first few students um<br>came through that so they'd have an<br>environmental science supervisor and a<br>chemistry supervisor and as some of you<br>will see from the names I was very<br>fortunate to have some really good um<br>students of um Peter Swedeland obviously<br>with us now um Sally Gore is a professor<br>at University of Canterbury um Jen<br>kilsby went off to be an environmental<br>consultant I was also asked to do an<br>analysis of a compound called TBT it's a<br>a contaminant Orland Regional Council<br>had had the University of Oakland do<br>this before by my predecessor who I was<br>in his office and they so they said well<br>they use that instrument so you should<br>do the next<br>analysis fortunately in ARA at a to had<br>was a student who just finished his<br>Masters using that equipment so was a<br>knew how to do that part and the arc<br>um um officer who took us in the<br>Henderson EST knew about where the<br>samples have been taken the previous<br>time so we we sort of winged it uh and<br>uh did that Peter came that back to do a<br>PhD and um after about one year asked me<br>to join his supervision team and then<br>likeed that Arrangement enough that when<br>he went on to a postto um named me and<br>Jim McCollin aago as a mentor so that's<br>been a really productive um<br>uh collaboration including a couple of<br>PhD students focusing as John said on<br>absorption on iron<br>oxides um but at about that same<br>time the university s dup a forensic<br>science program um mainly through Ralph<br>Cooney who was both uh dean of the<br>faculty of Science and on the board of<br>directors of of ESR and Keith Bedford at<br>the time was was director so they had<br>this idea<br>sketched it out Douglas Elliot was the<br>first director sketched out a little bit<br>more and then together with these three<br>s um San Harbison from biology Sally<br>Coulson physical evidence so paint um<br>accelerance and so on and Cox and from<br>drugs developed most of the program and<br>they needed about five lectures from an<br>analytical chemist on basic analytical<br>chemistry foric science scius would need<br>so I did that you can see the other<br>contributions but they realized after<br>about 6 months that um universities are<br>complicated places right we have our own<br>systems Douglas was from usar and had no<br>clue about just how to navigate the<br>university so they appointed me as<br>deputy director and I never escaped um<br>and actually probably being on that is<br>what led me eventually to be an<br>associate Dean and be aead of school<br>that there was um the exposure that I<br>got there that I think gave me the<br>confidence and also the exposure to go<br>through to that so I am grateful for<br>that um 2001 was my first fora into uh<br>if you like University politics we<br>decided that we had enough Master<br>students that we should have a PhD<br>program um so put together the folio<br>proving that we had that capability one<br>of the key things we needed was Library<br>resources and we were lucky enough to<br>have a librarian called seror Donahue<br>who effectively told Douglas and me what<br>we should be buying because she'd been<br>at ESR and knew about foric science so<br>yeah we had we got that really uh nailed<br>thank you Sonia um so when we did that<br>got it through and approved food science<br>said hey that was easy how did you do<br>that and so they did it the following<br>year um so one of the things that<br>happened that time was we had a really<br>focused program we knew that not all of<br>our graduates could go into that um and<br>so<br>uh we<br>uh said well what else they do and they<br>said well do environmental forensic<br>science I didn't know what this was but<br>they said well you do a white paper<br>about it so I did that so of sketching<br>out what it might be I went to the<br>environmental scientist who basically<br>said back off our turf and I went to<br>Harry Van anavart who was with the ESR<br>who said do everything that's associated<br>with the law um and I sort of navigated<br>between that um got on board the um the<br>lawyers and put together this um course<br>in environmental forensic science that<br>looked at the RMA looked at um poll UTS<br>um that we ran for about 20 years um I<br>eventually stopped teaching this as much<br>as anything because the government kept<br>trying to change the RMA and then the<br>next government came in and said well<br>we're not going to accept those changes<br>and I thought why should I teach my<br>forensic science students law that's<br>going to be irrelevant so we're now<br>teaching them um forensic data science<br>which I have nothing to do with but it's<br>a cool<br>course okay so here's some of the the<br>research then so some of the very early<br>stuff here's that luminol coming in<br>suddenly I found it had a use so as you<br>all know of course by now um forensic<br>scientists use luminol to spray around<br>and um blood acts as the Catalyst and<br>you get a glow of of luminol um but the<br>catch is that you sometimes get false<br>positives so if someone's cleaned up<br>with bleach then that Sparkles and our<br>uh experienced forensic scientists can<br>go ah that sparkling must be bleach I'll<br>focus on the soft glow<br>apparently um and so so what Arin did<br>was look to see if we could put a a<br>chemical into the uh lumino mix that<br>would react rapidly with the Bleach so<br>that you wouldn't<br>um get that interference um she was<br>doing all of this by shutting herself in<br>a dark room until her eyes had ACC<br>climatized and then with a stopwatch and<br>observation do it because we didn't have<br>digital cameras at that time um once she<br>had finished we then got a one of the<br>early digital cameras and repeated her<br>work she<br>but when she did it she found a compound<br>that worked but it was one you could<br>never use in forensic science because it<br>was an Aiming that smelt and was toxic<br>but we figured you could do just about<br>as well with amino acids and so this is<br>actually then Richard King's work so<br>here what we've done is smeared blood<br>horizontally bleach vertically and what<br>you're seeing here in the control if we<br>spray that we're getting glow from it<br>all if we add an amino acid you're<br>seeing nothing from the bleach and<br>you're just seeing it from the the blood<br>so that was kind of cool<br>um focusing a little bit more on blood<br>so the way typically that forensic<br>scientists used to and still do look for<br>blood is they look with a bright white<br>light and then if they see something<br>looks like blood if they do a chemical<br>test to gain with hydrogen peroxide and<br>acting as an as an oxidant um to<br>identify it positively we knew something<br>about the um Spectra of of of blood and<br>Pence and knew that they absorb far more<br>like strongly if you like in the purple<br>than they do in the blue or the the<br>infrared so we thought can we use that<br>to improve light so if you've ever seen<br>forensic science programs with a shining<br>blue lights around that's because<br>they're looking for things like blood<br>here I've just put it to grayscale you<br>can see it's much easier to see them<br>than here and so what John Wagner did<br>was took photographs with blue light<br>effectively with uh near infrared<br>averaged those and then compared them to<br>what you'd get at at purple either<br>depending how we did it it was sometimes<br>it was a subra fractions<br>divisions<br>and okay this set it's going so you can<br>see that we're getting much much better<br>um visibility here and even on a colored<br>fabric it's much more challenging but<br>we're able to see um the the blood<br>stains much more so that was kind of<br>cool that was all being done just by<br>putting in and out manual filters but<br>with that proof of concept we could then<br>convince the department to buy us a<br>filter wheel and then an electronic<br>filter changer so he did that over um<br>other parts of the um the Spectrum and<br>with other forensic<br>evidence now I'm not actually going to<br>talk to you much about fingerprint um<br>enhancement even though I've had a whole<br>lot of students doing this and got some<br>really cool images as much as anything<br>because sometimes I think of forensic<br>science as a reality check because<br>people are using it in homes or in um<br>police stations and such like you don't<br>have all of the PPE that we're used to<br>um and so some of the reasons that some<br>of the research that we've got will<br>never be de um taken on is that a<br>cheaper fingermark reagent was developed<br>so it's similar um color and fluoresence<br>but a cheaper the main solvent that we<br>use and everyone has for about the last<br>20 years has now been declared to<br>contribute to global warming and so it's<br>being phased out next year and then<br>these Coe pictures that I have have got<br>I use a highly fluorinated compound<br>which are now called um get get them<br>which are now called Forever chemicals<br>and are being banned so that's a<br>different contact and Trace if you<br>like um just looking at the time I'm<br>going to skip the first two here um and<br>mention um this one which was uh a very<br>um instructive for me collaboration with<br>James Karan so Gareth Campbell um went<br>around the South Island collecting<br>samples of punu or greenstone<br>um this was uh inspired by the fact that<br>uh nahu now owns all of the greenstone<br>its natural state in the South Ireland<br>there had been several cases of people<br>stealing or misrepresenting where they'<br>got samples of um of punu um and so the<br>question was could you use Elemental<br>analysis to prove where it came from so<br>he went up these remote Val uh valleys<br>with Gen scientists who were looking at<br>the amount of greenstone that was up<br>there took samples and subsamples p and<br>then looked at the variability of them<br>um so here you can see the sources that<br>he's getting from to try and work out<br>could we actually develop a<br>classification model you'll see that<br>it's not a perfect classification model<br>but it was certainly working to some<br>extent you see that this was a a project<br>collaboration<br>okay<br>now I then started to combine well I<br>take we're taking images we're<br>developing these ideas ideas of St<br>statistical complexity can we blend all<br>of these together and in my sub um<br>research and study leaves at University<br>of uh California San Diego we were<br>developing Optical sensors that maybe<br>you could put in your smartphone and so<br>if you were saying in a ra railway<br>station and someone let off a toxic gas<br>your smartphone would pick that up now<br>quite likely you'd have false positive<br>so what you do is you'd have lots of<br>people with these smartphones and if<br>everyone's phone showed that signal you<br>got other a problem here that was the<br>concept um catch was how do you make<br>that selective and so we tried modifying<br>some materials trying to put on<br>different chemistries different pore<br>sizes and then using our camera Imaging<br>um so here what we're doing is Imaging<br>along slices of a material looking at<br>color changes we're dosing in different<br>amounts of in this case rubbing alcohol<br>if you like isopropanol and then<br>discriminating different solvents based<br>on that um it didn't get um beyond the<br>first prototype primarily through um<br>engineering<br>problems but at that time a lot of um<br>governments in different countries were<br>getting worried about this idea of<br>people might um cause deliberate<br>contamination they might release<br>industrial chemicals our government and<br>Defense Force were two so our Defense<br>Force um had acquired this foam it's<br>called a blast suppression foam so if<br>you've got a bomb you put a little<br>hikers tent over it fill it with this<br>foam and if the bomb blows up it<br>actually keeps all of the fragments<br>inside that space um if they thought<br>there was a chemical involved they had<br>this a version of this that had a<br>chlorine bleach in it that they've put<br>in um you might think that's poor<br>photographic technique with the guy's<br>head chopped off that's because we were<br>not allowed to take pictures of their<br>heads because you might be able to<br>identify who it was so that's the bomb<br>disposal Squad um so this is uh Hazel<br>here she's busy trying to retrieve<br>forensic evidence to see what had this<br>chlorine bleach done to that evidence<br>and all the surfectants and stuff in<br>it so this is a sort of thing that she<br>was seeing that uh in this particular<br>case actually this was work from Pope<br>but they they're working on very similar<br>projects so they're looking at in this<br>case what happens if you're exposing<br>evidence to hydrochloric acid another<br>contaminant and so if you're dusting<br>with powder which is going on here not<br>much except you're getting more<br>background if you try and do superglue<br>fuming which you've probably most heard<br>of it um it Works through a base<br>polymerization so you've got acid around<br>it doesn't work at all so we're chemists<br>we know that if you've got acids around<br>you can counteract that with bases so<br>we're like well what base can we use<br>that's gaseous and doesn't stink and<br>isn't toxic that much because we'<br>learned a lesson with<br>luminol and so I knew that some oven<br>cleaners contain ethanolamine so I will<br>try that if people use it in their<br>kitchen you know can't be that bad can<br>it um and so this is the same as this<br>one over here so fingerprints exposed to<br>HCL we then expose them to ethanolamine<br>and he Presto the superglue works so<br>fingerprints um that gets me onto the<br>the final um research topic um so it's<br>metamphetamine<br>contamination suspected former<br>clandestine Labs so if there's a<br>clandestine methamphetamine lab<br>initially it's a crime scene the police<br>go in if necessary ESR go in clear it<br>away but now what have you got the<br>homeowner's got this dwelling that's got<br>uh um methampetamine contamination and<br>possibly other things in there and for a<br>while it was a sort of gray area of<br>who's responsible it's more clear now<br>but this was going way back to about<br>2004 so farmy was asking some really<br>basic questions because people decided a<br>place was contaminated by taking a a<br>surface white sample to take a tissue<br>wipe it over the surface extract it and<br>at that stage now it's 1.5 but at that<br>stage it suggested it was 5 microG of<br>medum phetamine per 100 square cm so how<br>much was really there to to in the first<br>place so he did things like deposit<br>known amounts of metamine on a surface<br>wipe it off see what sort of percentage<br>you could get left it down for a while<br>see where it came off and he' found that<br>at these small amounts a lot of it would<br>evaporate so we then would put two<br>plates together and he'd see some stayed<br>on the bottom plate and some would come<br>up to the top plate so get just gave us<br>some really basic understanding of what<br>was going on but at the same same time<br>developed some methods of analyzing<br>metamphetamine at really really low<br>levels then Liz came along and Liz had<br>been working for one of these testing<br>companies for this and she said I want<br>to actually go to um contaminated sites<br>places that have used it and do realtime<br>testing and she started in 2008 and when<br>she started doing this she'd go out take<br>samples people would come in and<br>remediate and they'd take samples<br>themselves and go this is now clean<br>she'd go back and find that she was<br>getting the same readings as she had the<br>first<br>time um so we went to the testing and<br>cleaning agents and say you need to fix<br>up your way of doing that your your<br>testing needs to be more more sensitive<br>you need to change your way you're<br>modifying it so by<br>2010 um things were being done reliably<br>so that never actually got published but<br>it was a contribution to the um cleaning<br>up of of um of sites in New<br>Zealand but what she was also interested<br>in was the concern that if you're taking<br>a surface sample here maybe there's some<br>contamination over here that you've<br>missed so she thought well maybe we<br>could take air samples around the<br>house um and if there was contamination<br>it would be evaporating and we'd pick it<br>up and know that there was a problem and<br>so she designed an apparatus that did<br>this using some commercial gear and it<br>worked really well except it only worked<br>if you had a really contaminated house<br>so depending on who you believe in New<br>Zealand the LI the limit is 1. 5 microG<br>or 15 microG per 100 square cm um and<br>her method worked if it was over<br>40 now Mensa um just did work inside the<br>laboratory so we would deliberately um<br>generate metamedium Vapor before you get<br>too excited wanting to come to my lab<br>we're generating at incredibly low<br>levels um and she developed a high<br>surface area sampler that could detect<br>down to the levels that would have<br>worked the catch was that it was a<br>highly manual way of making these um uh<br>Samplers and uh also required a special<br>adapter on our instruments so we could<br>inconvenient finally at this time told<br>you put your uh you and Alex<br>um we started looking at um chemistry of<br>metamphetamine and this is a a more<br>common theme um now that people are<br>becoming aware that your house is<br>actually part of the environment and<br>chemistry happens in your house actually<br>more so it's happening on you right now<br>so you you've got ozone running past you<br>and reacting with things like the<br>squalene coming off your uh skin and<br>having chemistry uh going on around you<br>don't think about it too much but<br>there's some really cool diagrams about<br>that out there um so we were initially<br>asking well what happens to<br>metamphetamine when people try to clean<br>it up with uh reagents that around so if<br>you use chlorine bleach you form this<br>compound here which is not not<br>necessarily a good idea because under<br>the right conditions you can just take<br>it right back to metamphetamine<br>so um not necessarily the the best idea<br>um there's some hydrogen peroxide based<br>contaminant decontaminants that you can<br>get but they don't make it go away like<br>some people think it's going to CO2 and<br>water it's not um it's so it's<br>predominantly forming this particular<br>compound here whose toxicity we're not<br>sure<br>about or if you do some green chemistry<br>and I know we've got green Chemists in<br>our um<br>in our department um you form this<br>compound called phen 2 propanone more<br>known as P2P which all the forensic drug<br>scientists know if you find that<br>typically that's telling you that the<br>metamphetamine was being made by a root<br>that's different from the one that is<br>always used in New Zealand yeah now in<br>red what I've put are possibilities of<br>gases that are in your house so you know<br>you've got ozone if you've got ozone<br>around Joel renob showed that you would<br>form this compound also and if you cook<br>with gas or you've got an unflued gas<br>heater you can be generating this stuff<br>called nitrous acid and that forms<br>something really nasty of these<br>nitrosamines are carcinogens and I'm not<br>just making this up because we went to<br>look for this and whether we could make<br>it because this chemistry is known to<br>happen with um tobacco smoke so you can<br>form these nitrosamines from nicotine so<br>it was not at all surprising that we<br>form it now it's we don't know that it's<br>ever been seen in houses so we don't<br>know how much is there um but it's<br>really that people aren't looking for<br>it um the main way that uh me pH is made<br>in New Zealand is um from iDine and all<br>of the blue arrows end up making Ben<br>zahide from that so that's all U mans's<br>work so here's the acknowledgements for<br>that<br>part uh and all of the master students<br>that I couldn't talk about um the John<br>mentioned that I had done the Tio walks<br>if you're willing to wait about another<br>5 to 10 minutes I can just run through a<br>little bit about that okay so if need to<br>go go but otherwise here's two<br>scientists taking on the tiaraa trail um<br>my brother I said was a um curator at<br>the uh National Museum he's one of New<br>Zealand's um best ornithologist so bird<br>watchers um in July this year um Birds<br>New Zealand was finishing in the New<br>Zealand bird Atlas so that's basically a<br>survey of birds right across New Zealand<br>the last time they did about 20 years<br>ago and he thought if I do the um tiar<br>Trail I can count the birds on 2 km<br>transects the whole way and therefore<br>I'll be able to add a lot of information<br>to the um bird Atlas in places that<br>other people won't have gone so that was<br>his plan um I'd thought about doing this<br>in my retirement but as you'll see in a<br>moment um<br>well partly because he was doing it the<br>logistics worked out um but there was<br>some other incentives as well um so a<br>little bit of jargon because I haven't<br>put in enough and you'll see some<br>spreadsheets in a moment um so Eli every<br>last inch you can guess what the E fi<br>stands for Soo South southbound so we<br>walked from Cape banga down to Bluff<br>through walk means you're doing it all<br>on one go um and slack packing means<br>that when you're in a place like Oakland<br>where I can go to my home then we just<br>in day packs and you know going out in<br>public transport walking back and so on<br>so some purists think that's bad thanks<br>bring<br>um but there are two kinds of people in<br>the world those who have done the tiar<br>haven't so you can see over here a map<br>of uh where it sort of goes so starts<br>down 90 Mile Beach and then crosses over<br>to ker kry down the middle of the North<br>Island down the middle of the South<br>Island um<br>T it it for a lot of it it was joining<br>up walking tracks um it avoids the great<br>walks because they're already um over<br>subscribed but it does go over the tongo<br>um Alpine crossing the wrong way so if<br>you ever doing it and you see someone<br>with a big pack going in the opposite<br>direction probably a trar walker and it<br>goes down the W River Journey because<br>fewer people do that<br>one so here's the preparation Colin did<br>it the right<br>way so he lives in Wellington so he<br>walked in the Hills um he was he needed<br>a GPS watch so he knew to when to start<br>his 2K to stop and in the middle to take<br>the GPS coordinates so he had all of<br>that<br>recorded and he was writing BL doing<br>science and writing blogs for TOA so he<br>convinced them to pay him um for two<br>days a week um to do this but as a<br>consequence of that he had to do this<br>detailed health and safety plan which is<br>why he's wearing all of that fluro we<br>will make more of that um we had to do<br>um uh first aid<br>courses you might wonder why he's<br>walking down the middle of a road that<br>is State Highway<br>1 um so not very safe necessarily but it<br>was because the mangam Moka Gorge um up<br>near Kaya was closed so that road had no<br>traffic on it um yeah so what did I do<br>well in late uh about mid 2022 I was<br>diagnosed with chronic kidney disease<br>which has an autoimmune<br>um component<br>um so that does annoying things like<br>make your legs swell and stuff so I went<br>on a really low salt diet you see the<br>consequence of that in the moment and<br>then in late 2022 it got worse uh my<br>kidney function dropped to 20% of normal<br>and they think about uh dialysis at 15%<br>so that was pretty scary for my<br>nephologist um so he put me on really<br>strong steroids and imuno supressive<br>drugs which were worse than the disease<br>um and about in March of that year I<br>also became anemic so when you you get<br>this kidney disease your kidneys<br>generate erotin which makes you read<br>blood cells so that shut off so I was<br>getting weekly injections of epo two<br>weekly blood tests because of these<br>immunosuppressive drugs so really didn't<br>seem like I was ready to do the trail<br>but fortunately by about August I'd gone<br>to three weekly EPO injections and<br>monthly um blood test CU I was on a<br>different uh<br>immunosuppressant um okay I'd lost 15<br>kilograms in a whole lot of body<br>conditioning<br>um so I wasn't quite sure whether I'd be<br>able to do it and certainly not keep up<br>with my brother but I figured I'd give<br>it a go what I did do though you see the<br>big ticks is I read what other people<br>had done and I read up about nutrition<br>and the best thing I did I was I went to<br>a podiatrist and he doing and after he'<br>said you're crazy um said what you<br>really need to do is get high quality<br>insoles because your feet need the<br>cushioning from all the roads that<br>you'll be walking on and Mand did I went<br>out with that one my my brother started<br>off in the shoes that he'd been doing<br>all his training and walking in within<br>about the first three days his feet had<br>swollen and so after 8 days he realized<br>he had to buy some new shoes and his<br>feet near never really recovered the<br>whole time which means I could keep up<br>with<br>them so my brother treated it completely<br>as a scientific Expedition so he planned<br>out the spreadsheet based on a colleague<br>he'd had who had done the walk the year<br>before his colleague was in his 30s and<br>a really fat Mountaineer the<br>consequences of that didn't actually<br>settle into US 60 year olds until about<br>halfway through the Tre um but we coped<br>um but he figured out where we'd be at<br>places that we could get Cafe meals or<br>home<br>meals um and we would need where we<br>wouldn't and he bought dehydrated meals<br>for every time that we would be away<br>from one of those places and put them<br>inore storage stations down New Zealand<br>so that when he was awake he could be<br>walking and Counting Birds he didn't<br>want to waste any time going off uh<br>shopping so of course if I was to keep<br>up with them I had to pretty much do the<br>same catch was um I'd done I mean I'd<br>already knew that um these foods are<br>dehydrated foods are pretty salty but<br>then I started doing research and I like<br>these things are really salty so I did a<br>spreadsheet of sodium to energy<br>and I picked my um dehydrated Foods<br>based on the sodium to energy ratio and<br>these were about the only ones i'<br>allowed myself so I figured that's not<br>much of a variety I'm not going to want<br>all of these multiple times throughout<br>the um the trip and also for those who<br>know about sodium these are these are<br>low but they're still high if that's<br>only one of your meals each day so uh in<br>about September um I bought a dehydrator<br>and dehydrated a whole lot of meals um<br>except because I was knew at it I didn't<br>trust that I could make things that<br>would last months and months for the<br>South isand so I ate all of those in the<br>north isand and just sort of lived with<br>the stuff in the South<br>Island um so I also did a a risk control<br>Matrix because we're good at those now<br>um so you could see you know i' figured<br>that I was I was in you know suppressed<br>so I just couldn't you know take a cup<br>and get that lovely Mountain stream<br>water it just wasn't worth the risk<br>fortunately these days they have really<br>good um water filters and stuff<br>um the immunosuppress to on makes it<br>more likely I'm going to get skin cancer<br>from Sun so you can see over here all<br>the consequences of those risk things<br>we're dressed extremely<br>differently so it's not just character<br>although it is that partly he's much<br>more of a risk taker than I am um so<br>that's that's just south of new of<br>paliston North heading into the<br>terros here's our priorities Collins<br>would account birds talk science<br>publicized the blog cuz he wanted<br>everyone to uh to read it get to the<br>next Hut<br>safety okay probably<br>his Museum thinks that safety would be<br>higher up but they're not necessarily<br>prioritized and then when we got to the<br>South Island and there weren't as many<br>birds he added out identify lizards to<br>that picture that's a lot harder I won't<br>go into that you can see my list is<br>shorter and it's slightly<br>different so Colin was is really skilled<br>he'd be walking along and writing down<br>the birds that he s saw or heard can<br>identify them and count them as he's<br>going quite imp credible not just on<br>roads but on reasonably rough tracks<br>where it got too rough he would count up<br>about three species and seven of each<br>and then have to do brain dumps which<br>was all fine except when this is a posed<br>photograph but later on he does that<br>halfway down a double set of Rapids on<br>the Wong anoi<br>River or this one over here we just<br>walked out from um a rig and Bush it was<br>snowing um into gale force winds with<br>sleet and as phone went off for a GPS<br>coordinate so he wrote it down this<br>one's actually a little bit further down<br>recording probably New Zealand's<br>toughest puppets um that he just spotted<br>um and if you have a look closely his<br>knees are bent because he's bracing<br>himself against gale force<br>winds um but um this one here um that's<br>most people say that's the scariest part<br>of the um trip apparent it's really<br>steep we didn't think it was that bad<br>probably I think because there was so<br>much Cloud around that we only saw the<br>trail that we needed to go on but as you<br>can see from this we had some<br>spectacular weather um Brent that's the<br>pass um and through the Terr I was<br>really worried about both of those<br>because I'd heard bad things about them<br>so beautiful weathers um next one<br>typical day look at mine first it's<br>pretty close to what most Walkers are<br>like except Pro probably I had a couple<br>of hours more sleep than most of them<br>did so I'd get up have breakfast walk<br>have dinner go to<br>bed um my brother on the other hand<br>would have dinner uh sorry would have<br>that first drink transcribe his bird<br>sighting so this is literally what he's<br>been writing as he goes along<br>transcribes that into his field<br>notebooks that takes an hour or 2 hours<br>depending on how long we've been walking<br>for has his dinner enters all of that<br>into an A3<br>spreadsheet using a cell phone as a<br>calculator um then I'll go to bed and<br>then if it's time to do one of his blogs<br>he'll get up at like 1: or 2 a.m. and<br>write the blog so he was surviving that<br>whole four months on about 3 to 5 hours<br>sleep a night whereas I was getting 8 to<br>9 and again I think that leveled things<br>out um when you get up early pretty cool<br>sunsets it's a little bit more up the<br>top that's just some of the um typical<br>places that would stop for meals if it<br>was just Colin and me<br>um we we lived by 2 km so we're only<br>allowed to stop at a 2 km Mark so at<br>about mid morning he'd say do you want<br>morning tea here or in 2 kilm<br>time sometimes it was a hard decision um<br>the bottom um is diff various<br>accommodation that we were in that<br>yellow tent um it's mine I only bought<br>it a couple of years ago it's much<br>lighter than one I had 30 years ago um<br>twers internal frame by the time I got<br>to carry carry I knew my pack was too<br>heavy so that got dumped I bought a new<br>tent off a family<br>friend that's my little tent whoops<br>that's my little tent there that's what<br>everyone has they're so lightweight they<br>don't even have poles or frames you use<br>your walking poles as the the tent<br>poles um so just to sorted other places<br>so we stayed about a third of the time<br>in tents third in huts and a third in<br>houses and homes and<br>motels lots of water Crossings I won't<br>go through them detail just if you ever<br>saw in the herald that there was an<br>extract from a book called every effing<br>inch uh describing the former um M of um<br>Wellington doing this trip they talked<br>about how horrible it with um this River<br>was how high it was there was no sun I<br>took that picture deliberately to show<br>you know babbling Brooks sunlet um not a<br>problem we crossed a much much bigger<br>Rivers than that but usually at those<br>times my camera was in a waterproof bag<br>in my pack so you don't see those um but<br>partly because of that um health and<br>safety thing when we're doing that we<br>were always um locked together and<br>that's the yacht that we went across the<br>cockren and you'll see other forms of<br>getting across bigger<br>water and so there it is there's the<br>summary uh you can read that<br>amazingly we finished on the day that we<br>predicted we would finish which is just<br>as well because my nephew was getting<br>married 5 days later<br>um you'll see that there's some pretty<br>big times there 14.4 hours and um<br>49k we forced that on us because we um<br>before we got to the terros the um<br>captain of the yacht we were taking said<br>unless you get here a day earlier than<br>you thought the winds are going to be<br>too strong to take you across crck<br>straight so we made up a day through the<br>terror R which was pretty<br>challenging um full packs out we did two<br>38k days that were separated by a day<br>and to her credit Denise just happened<br>to join us for one of those so did 38k<br>without any training with a full pack on<br>full credit to her um if you want to<br>know about the birds just uh Google um<br>bird blog uh to Papa or Tiara you'll<br>find all his blogs he counted over<br>106,000 Birds during that time 111<br>species I probably saw about 100 100 of<br>those I've just put a bit there for if<br>there's any bird nerds in the in the<br>audience uh and then heaps of thanks and<br>thank you for staying a little bit<br>longer</p></main><footer
