100% accurate.</p><p>e<br>for<br>um welcome ladies and gentlemen my name<br>is Charles Lee I'm an associate<br>professor of microbial genomics in the<br>school of science at this<br>University um I'd like to open this<br>great event the<br>2024 3mt 3 minute thesis finalist<br>competition um and first of all I would<br>like to welcome my colleague um<br>associate professor Michel muo who is<br>the acting dean of the school of<br>graduate research to come to the podium<br>Michael yep um and he's going to<br>introduce introduce all of us to the<br>event<br>t uh welcome to the 3mt finals my name<br>is Michael mzo um I'm an associate<br>professor of chemistry and currently the<br>acting dean of sgr here we are again at<br>this auspicious occasion it is both a<br>privilege and a pleasure to stand before<br>you today as we celebrate the dedication<br>passion and intellectual rigor of the<br>PhD students who are speaking today this<br>is not just a competition but it's a<br>Showcase of the Innovative research and<br>groundbreaking ideas that are shaping<br>the future of the various Fields<br>represented by each of our participant<br>speakers furthermore the winner of<br>tonight's competition will receive<br>$1,000 towards their research costs in<br>their PHD which is a keenly needed lot<br>of cash in these financially lean times<br>and they will also have their name<br>engraved on the Professor JD craw trophy<br>which was carved and gifted by Mr wiu<br>puki and this is on display usually in<br>the sgr reception the winner will also<br>be the University's representative in<br>the Asia Pacific virtual 3mt semi-finals<br>held on October the 8th of this year and<br>potentially if they win that then they<br>could participate in the Asia Pacific<br>virtual 3mt finals on October 30 the<br>runner up of today's competition will<br>also get uh will get $500 also to use<br>for research<br>costs PhD research as many of you<br>appreciate as a journey marked by<br>curiosity perseverance and countless<br>hours of hard work from it can come<br>wonderful rewards a job a title and the<br>awareness that one is making a unique<br>contribution to knowledge today our<br>participants have the unique opportunity<br>to share their findings perspectives and<br>stories behind their academic Pursuits<br>in a laconically crafted<br>speech the delivery of the speech is key<br>however and that is the point of the<br>competition to keep the audience engaged<br>and to make them aware of the main<br>points of the research and their<br>findings and to make us interested in<br>learning more as a lecturer I can say<br>when I'm delivering information that the<br>most telling and Silent critique of your<br>speaking style can be when you cast your<br>faces on your hopefully attentive<br>audience if you see the matter of fact<br>or attentive look you at least know<br>you're on the right track but woe and<br>bide you if you catch the tragic look of<br>a face that is about to let out a<br>cavernous yawn as that is quite brutal<br>critique and then you know that you have<br>to scale back on your discussion of your<br>mathematical proof and Infuse a little<br>excitement by stopping it or carrying on<br>of something more<br>light-hearted of course tonight there<br>will be no such risk as we have an<br>exciting and enthusiastic array of<br>speakers who I know will inspire you<br>with their Charisma as we listen to the<br>presentations we'll appreciate the<br>diversity of topics covered and the<br>depth of expertise that each presenter<br>will bring to the stage I think will'll<br>be inspired by their commitment to<br>advancing their fields and their courage<br>to present their work in this format and<br>in this uh public forum so let me finish<br>by saying a big thanks to the tyus team<br>from school of graduate research who<br>have been involved in the planning of<br>this event to our dvcr professor Gary<br>Wilson our caters and support staff and<br>I'd like to extend my gratitude also to<br>our panel of Judges whose expertise and<br>Discerning eyes and ears will help us<br>recognize the outstanding achievements<br>of our presenting speak of our<br>presenters I don't envy your role<br>tonight as it will be a difficult task<br>to pick the best one to the presenters<br>we applaud your courage and hard work<br>today is a celebration of your journey<br>and the passion you bring to your<br>research regardless of the outcome each<br>of you is already a winner for the<br>dedication and enthusiasm you have shown<br>a big vote of thanks to you also the<br>audience for being here to show your<br>support we've had excellent numbers<br>tonight as we look forward to an<br>engaging and enlightening evening<br>remember as the audience you have the<br>opportunity to have your say also in the<br>People's Choice Awards there is a QR<br>code in the booklet that is provided for<br>you so you can digitally vote and for<br>those of you who find yourself tonight<br>without a cell phone there will also be<br>an alternative way to do this so let the<br>presentations begin and the best of luck<br>much thank you Michael um before we<br>start the event um I would like to<br>introduce you to the format of the event<br>as well as the judges and perhaps most<br>importantly the sponsors that enable<br>tonight's event to happen so tonight's<br>event was supported um was sponsored by<br>baroth and Associates um and I don't<br>know if there's anybody from our sponsor<br>here but I actually know John baroff who<br>started the firm quite well um I assure<br>you he he's a really good guy um and so<br>tonight's event as you can imagine is<br>going to involve our finalists coming up<br>to give their presentation um one after<br>another with me in projecting in between<br>to introduce them um and that we expect<br>to to finish Just sh shy of 8:00 and<br>then there will be an intermission and<br>during the intermission um the most<br>important thing for the audience is to<br>use this barcode uh and your mobile<br>device to vote for People's Choice Award<br>um and as Michael said if you don't have<br>a cell phone we have a backup plan so<br>please go outside and find somebody who<br>looks like they want to give you a paper<br>ballot and they'll they'll help you<br>out um so lastly I'd like to introduce<br>our judging panel so first of all we<br>have Professor<br>Kapa so that's she's the dean of the<br>faculty of mar indigenous studies at our<br>University um so Tangi holds a PhD in<br>philosophy and her recent interest um<br>around Mii Mii education and pedagogy as<br>well as oral tradition uh in preserving<br>the narratives of<br>kamua um Tangi grew up in aami um and<br>she's married to her husband poya and<br>they have two beautiful daughters as<br>well as five mapuna and I was told that<br>today was is actually um the five the<br>the fifth birthday of one of her mapuna<br>but she's being here instead and pushing<br>that celebration to a different<br>date um and our next um judge is Dr John<br>Sharp um John has um is the Executive<br>Vice President Floetry as cytonome and<br>if that's not impressive he also<br>previously held the roles of CTO and CEO<br>at the same company um so he has 25<br>years more than 25 years of experience<br>is developing Technologies for advanced<br>cellular analysis and sorting um and one<br>of the one of the many um projects he's<br>currently involved in is trying to<br>create a cure for parking Parkinson's<br>disease um so John H's a PhD in physics<br>from the University of wo and he is uh<br>he spent several years as a board member<br>on the University of wo engineering<br>Advisory Board and he was a panel he was<br>a board member for gns science as<br>well lastly but not least is um Shelly<br>Campbell um Shelly uh is affiliated with<br>napi and Niti ni and she's the CEO of<br>wise group one of the largest community<br>based community- based NGS in<br>aloa sh has experience in health<br>spending um 30 years including um the<br>establishment of the wo District Health<br>Board uh she was also the chief<br>executive of wo Bay of planty Cancer<br>Society and wo Primary Health and she uh<br>is also an honorary captain in the Royal<br>Navy uh New Zealand Navy and she also<br>has a connection to this University<br>because her mother the late um Nola<br>Campbell um was actually a Pioneer in in<br>the um the school of education um almost<br>20 years ago in digital education so um<br>we also have our timekeeper here um and<br>if you if you see him oh W I'm getting<br>ahead of myself but the way it will work<br>okay for the um for the contestants is<br>that obviously as the name implies they<br>have three minutes and it's a it's a<br>hard limit for three minutes so there<br>will be a three minute timer that they<br>can see but you won't be able to see but<br>what you will see is when our timekeeper<br>holds up a little orange card they have<br>30 seconds to go and when the time uh<br>when the bell rings they have to stop<br>talking okay I know I'm not I'm not<br>helping them with their stress right now<br>so I'm I'm not going to go um talking<br>about what happens if they keep talking<br>after the Bell um but um but suffice to<br>say that I I these these students are<br>extraordinarily well prepared and I'm<br>sure you will enjoy every single<br>presentation um so some housekeeping<br>matters so first of all please switch<br>your cell phone to silence um and true<br>Silent not vibration because some<br>vibration can be quite loud<br>um and please don't move around during<br>presentations because that could<br>distract our our finalist and that would<br>not be very fair or nice um so please<br>only move around when the judges are<br>making their notes um during that time<br>feel free to move around but if you if<br>you if somebody's presenting please<br>don't don't move around um and for<br>evacuating procedure please exit or in<br>an olderly fashion out of these doors<br>the same doors you came in uh in the<br>event of an emergency and without<br>further ado<br>I would like to um open um start with<br>our finalists so our first finalist is<br>simna russek and her research is to use<br>to conduct statistical analysis of<br>historical data to understand the future<br>hello everyone uh have you noticed<br>summer is getting more hotter and winter<br>is more severe now and this extreme<br>weather events like flood and storm are<br>more frequent climate change is real and<br>it is a real threat to our planet but<br>there is still hope even though we are<br>at a stage where we cannot completely<br>stop climate change but we can build<br>resilience towards it CDC has outlined<br>five steps to design and develop a<br>climate change adaptation plan in my<br>research work I am focusing on three of<br>those uh steps using Mission learning<br>and artificial<br>intelligence nowadays whenever we talk<br>about artificial intelligence everybody<br>will suddenly start thinking about chat<br>GPT and large language model but it is<br>far more than just chat GPT I'm using<br>Mission learning to forecast the<br>influence of climate change in three<br>critical areas agriculture ecosystem and<br>Healthcare I have already developed a<br>sustainable crop ELD forecast model<br>using environmental factors and also<br>developed a soil moisture prediction<br>model the result from my soil moisture<br>prediction model is used to understand<br>how native trees are helping uh reducing<br>soil loss and improving water<br>quality and currently I am working on a<br>infectious disease for casting model for<br>a digital twin now you're wondering what<br>is digital twin digital twin is nothing<br>but a virtual replica of our real world<br>I am using multi- sources of data and<br>feeding into this digital twin the data<br>that I am feeding in is Healthcare data<br>socio economical data weather data and<br>climate modeling data then I'm analyzing<br>the trend and the relationship and the<br>interplay between these key factors in<br>these critical areas this will helps us<br>to understand vulnerabilities based on<br>that we can design and develop targeted<br>intervention and adaptation plan for<br>example we can predict infectious<br>disease in different stages of heat wave<br>in digital twin that that result can<br>then be used in healthcare to trigger an<br>early warning for what vulnerable<br>population my project lays a groundwork<br>for developing a climate change<br>adaptation plan by combining multiple<br>modeling methods we can build strong<br>plans and apply in real world<br>application This research work is a<br>small steps towards bettering our planet<br>for the future thank you<br>thank you simna our next next speaker is<br>Lauren gree she's going to talk about<br>nuda speech um no no not sorry not nuda<br>speech um nud Brank you will learn what<br>is the ocean is such an amazing<br>environment<br>so how would you feel if the next<br>generation of pharmaceutical drugs were<br>inspired by the complex and wonderful<br>Marine World Imagine the scenario where<br>tomorrow your treatment for nasty tumor<br>or long-standing chronic pain comes from<br>the marine<br>environment but what if I told you that<br>this is already the<br>reality at this very moment 13 drugs<br>derived from the sea have already been<br>approved and are used in the treatment<br>of<br>cancer but the world is in constant need<br>of more efficient and diverse drugs by<br>investigating shelless C slugs or nudie<br>branks my research aims to find new<br>chemicals with pharmaceutical<br>applications nud branks are colorful and<br>resourceful organisms and some can feed<br>on chemically defended Marine sponges<br>and steal these chemicals to deta<br>Predator this way they kill two birds<br>with one stone nutrition and chemical<br>protection SM<br>right it is much easier to analyze the<br>source of these chemicals large sponges<br>rather than the tiny SE slugs but I<br>still need to find which sponge they eat<br>and to do that I have designed food<br>Choice experiments to determine their<br>favorite<br>sponge in the same way that you prefer<br>chocolate to brussel sprout nudie branks<br>also have<br>preferences I am putting my trust onto<br>the CIS lugs to guide me towards sponges<br>full of useful chemicals and this s slug<br>haven't led me astray yet with this gold<br>margin nud Brank showing a strong<br>preference for mysterious black sponge I<br>analyzed the sponge and was able to<br>discover five new chemicals including<br>the<br>H in my research I am a chemical<br>detective uncovering new compounds from<br>nature these compounds showed some<br>activity against her human cervical<br>cancer cell line and further test<br>testing is currently ongoing and who<br>knows maybe the next time you go to the<br>pharmacy you will think about this C<br>slugs helping us find a medicine of the<br>attention right I just have my<br>metaphorical hand metap metaphorically<br>slapped because I didn't give the judges<br>notes um because it's actually quite<br>bright I couldn't quite see the judges<br>um right so that was a really<br>interesting presentation and my joke<br>completely failed to land um but and um<br>and now I'm trying to to find time okay<br>now I have to I have a new challenge<br>because I need to fill this time while<br>the judges are making their notes<br>without distracting<br>them um<br>so I hope that clarify what a nudy Brank<br>is a nudie Brank is basically a shess um<br>a<br>shess um what's the right word slug yep<br>well I guess slugs all shallow I'm<br>thinking of um aidans aidans can be hard<br>or soft um<br>and the next speaker um is going is uh<br>she Zoo<br>and she's from um the division of<br>education and her topic is about<br>exploring whether being proficient in<br>English is sufficient for effective<br>communication and because I screw up the<br>first one I have to give the judges<br>presentations right this is awkward<br>I assure you my lectures are normally<br>better than<br>this<br>that's that's a much better plan thank<br>you right well without further Ado<br>hello everyone have you ever taught or<br>studied in a multicultural classroom<br>have you ever considered how cultural<br>differences May influence your teaching<br>or learning imagine you are taught in a<br>language that is not your native tongue<br>and you have to understand all those<br>complicated ideas in that language while<br>also dealing with cultural differences<br>this is the harsh reality that many<br>International students are facing my<br>research Focus on the integration of<br>culture into Emi you may ask what is Emi<br>e for English M for media I for<br>instruction so Emi stands for English as<br>a median of instruction English is used<br>to teach subjects in many countries<br>where their first language may not even<br>be English for example in my<br>professional context in China we also<br>use English to teach subjects many<br>courses to Chinese univers to students<br>and international students<br>even though our first language as you<br>know is vendoring then culture what is<br>culture is culture ear essential in in<br>my course and how can we really<br>integrate it these are the questions my<br>research aims to<br>explore why is this research important<br>globalization has made English the<br>global language do you know how many<br>people use English in the world one and<br>a half billion however if we only focus<br>on teaching our students the English<br>language is not enough understanding<br>cultural context can better help these<br>students communicate more effectively<br>with their friends from different<br>cultures my own Journey began with my<br>experience as an English learner first<br>and then I also use English to teach<br>history at the University I us to focus<br>on teaching my students vocabulary<br>grammar and translation then I realized<br>this traditional approach could not<br>really prepare me to connect with my<br>students from different cultures then I<br>began to wonder how can us my teachers<br>better help these students become not<br>only proficient in English but also<br>culturally aware therefore my research<br>adopts a qualitative approach to collect<br>the data through online questionnaires<br>semi-structured interviews and classroom<br>observations my participants are Emi<br>teachers who teach subjects including<br>business mathematics engineering and<br>history in China I also study remember<br>one em my history teacher told me that<br>he talk about confucious and Aristotle<br>in his class which not only enhanced his<br>students critical thinking but also<br>improved his students understandings of<br>different cultural<br>perspectives all of this considered I<br>strongly argue that it is really<br>important and necessary for us to<br>integrate culture into immigr hores<br>thank<br>you right I'm going to walk extra<br>slow um and it's really difficult<br>because I know that some people are<br>trying to get us to be more comfortable<br>with silence but being a lecture that's<br>really hard for me because if it's<br>silent then I'm doing something wrong<br>um so and I know it's really difficult<br>to start a a useful<br>conversation in the time that it takes<br>the judges to write their notes so I'm<br>time<br>um no I'm not going to talk about the<br>right our next presenter is Mustafa<br>pasand from the school of um Computing<br>and mathematical science talking about<br>facilitate how we can facilitate New<br>Zealand's transition to a zero emission<br>hello everyone today I'm here to discuss<br>the urgent need to transition from oil<br>and gas to renewable energy in New<br>Zealand as of now the primary energy<br>consumption in New Zealand industry<br>heavily relies on oil and gas to address<br>this there is a crucial necessity to<br>Electrify this sectors and also<br>transition to entirely renewable energy<br>resources for electricity production in<br>2019 New Zealand committed to achieving<br>Net Zero carbon emission by 20150<br>setting the challenging goal that<br>require us to rethink how we manage and<br>utilize these renewable<br>resources one of the significant<br>challenge in this endeavor is<br>unpredictable nature of dis renewable<br>resources like solar and wind such<br>resources are dependent on WEA time of<br>the day or seasons making it difficult<br>to efficiently store and use energy<br>produced from them also without accurate<br>prediction balancing Supply and demands<br>becomes more complex potentially leading<br>to energy<br>vestage my PhD research focuses on<br>Advanced machine learning techniques to<br>tackle these challenges machine learning<br>which is the branch of artificial<br>intelligence allows computer to learn<br>from historical data and predict<br>outcomes this capability help us to plan<br>energy storage and integrate renewable<br>energy to the grid<br>effectively moreover these predictive<br>models help us to understand the scale<br>of energy storage needed by accurately<br>forecasting of energy production we can<br>determine appropriate size and placement<br>of a storage facilities this ensures<br>that energy is available when<br>needed as a part of Aura project my<br>research<br>by examining data from online databases<br>explores how machine learning can<br>Electrify and decarbonize energy<br>resources into The Meat Processing<br>Industries these applications<br>demonstrates the benefit of machine<br>learning in managing renewable energy<br>both in terms of understanding the<br>patterns of production and understanding<br>patterns of demand in conclusion<br>integration of machine learning into<br>renewable energy system is<br>transformative IT addresses variability<br>making renewable energy resources more<br>reliable and efficient through my<br>research I aim to contribute to New<br>Zealand carbon neutral future by 20150<br>thank you so much for your<br>attention it is quite amazing how much<br>information the contestants managed to<br>pack into 3 minutes uh I'm very glad I<br>didn't have to do one of these because<br>um some people in this room know one<br>time when I was giving a presentation at<br>a conference I went overtime so much<br>that they practically had to drag me off<br>the stage um and and I also have a<br>colleague one time that um she was<br>giving a presentation and she had gone<br>over twice the allocated time<br>and I had gone all the way up I was<br>literally standing next to her she and I<br>was breathing down her neck didn't<br>affect her at all she just kept on<br>giving her talk as if nothing<br>happened um so I think it was and being<br>up here it's quite intimidating and I'm<br>I've done quite a bit of public speaking<br>and um and I get nervous so I can only<br>imagine what it's like for these<br>students and this the fact that they are<br>say right our next speaker is Sheeran<br>The much more famous zann Sheeran than<br>Ed Sheeran um and from the School of<br>Psychology he's going to talk about um<br>Can sustainable practices in the<br>productivity there is no Planet B this<br>is the message that we've been hearing<br>from environmentalists for the past<br>Century so it may shock you to learn<br>that we're currently using 1.7 times the<br>amount of Natural Resources generated by<br>Earth every year and it's only getting<br>worse because of this organizations<br>around the world from accounting firms<br>to zoos are all under pressure to play<br>their part and to increase their level<br>of<br>sustainability consumers want to<br>purchase green goods and services<br>shareholders want their company to look<br>green and governments are rewarding<br>green businesses with tax incentives<br>organizations are also Under Pressure to<br>increase the level of well-being in the<br>workplace reports from around the world<br>show that well-being is at an all-time<br>low and this isn't just a personal<br>problem low levels of well-being in the<br>workplace result in employees taking<br>time off without a valid reason having<br>low levels of performance and<br>productivity and ultimately handing in<br>their notice and looking for work<br>elsewhere and this comes at a huge cost<br>to the global economy estimated to be<br>around $1.6 trillion each and every year<br>so wouldn't it be great for all of us<br>and more importantly for our planet if<br>our employers sustainability increased<br>our well-being Not only would being<br>Greener result in a happier healthier<br>Planet but happier healthier workers too<br>and this is what my research looks at<br>with the ultimate goal of providing<br>further benefits for why organizations<br>should focus on going<br>green two studies and hundreds of survey<br>results later we found positive and<br>significant links between how green a<br>company is seen to be by their employees<br>and their employees well-being and<br>performance my next study which is<br>currently underway investigates if<br>increasing an organization<br>sustainability causes an increase in<br>employee well-being and performance<br>we're doing this by working with<br>businesses and measuring employee<br>outcomes before and after in increasing<br>their<br>sustainability but why is this<br>important organizations wield a lot more<br>power and influence that individuals do<br>when it comes to making impactful<br>changes they can drive large scale<br>sustainability projects and change Norms<br>so by integrating sustainability into<br>our organizational practices we can<br>solve two major issues at once boosting<br>employee well-being and performance<br>whilst also protecting our one and only<br>planet thank<br>you right so my good friend fetu gave me<br>a great idea to um a topic to talk about<br>which is the origin of the 3mt<br>competition so the 3mt competition was<br>started in 2008 at the University of<br>Queensland which marks the second thing<br>that Queensland has contributed since<br>um and I think that cons I I would say<br>that Crocodile Dundee is maybe more<br>enter maybe just as entertaining but I<br>think there's uh people learn a lot more<br>from um that these 3mt competitions than<br>they do from that film um I think the<br>the main takeaway there is that<br>Australians walk around with giant<br>takeaway and and I've been in New<br>Zealand long enough to know that it's<br>always funny to make fun of Australia<br>earlier<br>great our next contestant is Megan Roso<br>rouso from the School of Science she's<br>going to talk about<br>consumption which is the 19th century<br>name for<br>tuberculosis um and believe it or not it<br>is very much a 21st century disease<br>still and she's going to talk about some<br>imagine an enemy that can invade your<br>body Li dormant for years and then<br>awaken to wreak havoc this is the nature<br>of tuberculosis the world's deadliest<br>infectious disease killing more people<br>than HIV and malaria combined our<br>Frontline defense against tuberculosis<br>has long relied on a powerful arsenal of<br>antibiotics with current treatments<br>combining at least four of these strong<br>antibiotics and consists of a treatment<br>regimen of four six or even nine months<br>but despite already being unpleasant the<br>fight against this disease has become<br>increasingly urgent with the rise of<br>bacterial strains resistant to our<br>remaining treatments to treat these drug<br>resistant strains we need to develop new<br>and powerful anti-tb drugs but first we<br>need to understand how tuberculosis<br>remains resistant to even our most<br>advanced treatments so in bacteria DNA<br>acts as the battle plans outlining<br>strategies to survive antibiotic and<br>immune attack it contains the genetic<br>code that directs the production of<br>proteins which acts like an army of<br>soldiers defending against antibiotic<br>threats a strategy tuberculosis uses to<br>remain resistance is DNA protection from<br>damage and a crucial protein it uses to<br>do this is alisar to this protein is<br>essential in antibiotic resistance it<br>turns on the genes needed for survival<br>allowing the bacteria to produce more<br>defensive proteins and it acts like a<br>molecular Shield protecting the DNA<br>against antibiotics and environmental<br>dangers as alisu is essential in<br>bacterial survival we believe that by<br>inactivating this protein and removing<br>that molecular sh Shield we will kill<br>the bacteria therefore developing drugs<br>that Target lsar 2 could be key to<br>stopping tuberculosis in its tracks but<br>to do this we need to have a solid<br>understanding of what alisu looks like<br>and how it functions inside the cell but<br>this can be difficult as proteins are<br>incredibly small and require specialized<br>techniques and equipment to be seen my<br>research aims to use these techniques to<br>visualize and measure the function of<br>lsr2 in the cell looking at exactly how<br>this protein Shields DNA and reveal what<br>lsr2 looks like for use in drug design<br>so far I have isolated lsr2 and am on my<br>way to obtaining the three-dimensional<br>molecular structure of this protein this<br>will be essential in uncovering key<br>molecular details allowing us to add<br>powerful new weapons to our Arsenal<br>in the fight against antibiotic<br>resistant<br>tuberculosis without commenting on the<br>presentation I feel like I need to do my<br>duty as a microbiologist to use this<br>opportunity to do some Public Service<br>Announcement there are things you can do<br>in addition to the brilliant things that<br>people like Megan are doing um there are<br>things things you can do to slow down<br>our losing war against antibiotics<br>resistance okay first of all don't take<br>antibiotics unless you've been<br>prescribed it um and if you if you go to<br>the doctor and the doct look carefully<br>at what the doctor prescribes okay<br>because if it's a viral disease<br>antibiotics does nothing and if you are<br>unfortunately prescribed antibiotics<br>please take it as um as as uh prescribed<br>okay don't skip one don't stop because<br>you're feeling better um that's how you<br>really you breed<br>resistance so um these are very simple<br>things right so don't take antibiotics<br>unless you really need to um and if a<br>doctor prescribes you antibiotics<br>unnecessarily tell them that you noticed<br>because they some some not not<br>everybody's on board right some of them<br>need to be told by the patient that this<br>is not this is not okay um it's not okay<br>to prescribe antibiotics like candy and<br>if you if you do have to take them<br>please take the entire course don't<br>finish early because you're feeling<br>better all right so that was my public<br>service<br>announcement right our next speaker is<br>kashala baral from the school of health<br>she's going to talk about understanding<br>the mobility challenges of an AG in<br>society<br>let me start with asking a<br>question what age group do you think is<br>the most likely to have a fatle car<br>crash<br>anyone I suspect many of you are<br>thinking about those new drivers those<br>18 to 22 years old with fast flash cars<br>well it's not there's something else<br>that's going on mortality rates<br>following a car crass are highest among<br>older people those over 65<br>years and the older you are and you're<br>still driving the risk continues to<br>scalet does that surprise you this is<br>something that has been known about for<br>a long time but much of our Focus has<br>been on the younger drivers as compared<br>to older people this is why I am here<br>and my resarch is all about reducing<br>Road accidents and fatalities among<br>older people there are many reasons to<br>this but one of the most praising ones<br>relates to cognitive impairment surely<br>though older people with cognitive<br>impairment should stop driving but it's<br>not as easy as saying well now we are<br>done driving driving a car often means<br>independent<br>and you take that away the quality of<br>life of that older person changes<br>invariably worse for the family member<br>and Healthcare team supporting that<br>person what can we do what is the best<br>way of managing this situation this is<br>where my research comes in my mixed<br>method two-phase study started last year<br>this year in coordination with health<br>New Zealand and dementia New Zealand I<br>have run five focus groups across the<br>waat region bringing together 30 family<br>members of people with cognitive<br>impairment the preliminary findings have<br>suggested some important issues first<br>conflict among the family members about<br>how to cope with the lack of transport<br>and family available to them second<br>danger increased risk of accidents when<br>you are driving a vehicle when not fit<br>to drive third no one knows a shockingly<br>inadequate oversight of how the Health<br>Care system works and who holds the<br>decision dilemas created by<br>inconsistent diagnosis of the fitness to<br>drive well this is just of the<br>preliminary findings and in the next<br>phase i' would like to continue with<br>conducting a national survey and extend<br>to the rest of of New Zealand thank<br>you right I spent the last three minutes<br>thinking about how I can link this to<br>the um the the vehicle that recently<br>made a unfortunate entrance to our Lake<br>here um I could not think of a taste a<br>tasteful way to do it so I'm not going<br>great our next speaker is Nikki Webb<br>from the School of Science she's going<br>to talk about her exploration of the<br>invisible partners of pasture grass to<br>agriculture is the foundation to New<br>Zealand's economy bringing in billions<br>of dollars every year but how many of<br>you know that a tiny fungus known as an<br>indify plays a crucial role to this<br>success these indify live inside the<br>grass and produce bioactive compounds<br>that protects the grass against various<br>threats Without End fights grass can be<br>highly vulnerable to pissed insects<br>which devastate our pastures this would<br>force our Farmers to rely heavily on<br>chemical pesticides increasing their<br>costs and causing potential<br>environmental harm also grasses without<br>indites are less resilient to<br>environmental stresses like drought or<br>disease leading to reduce productivity<br>and compromise pasture health so we know<br>we need these Ender fights for pasture<br>survival but unfortunately not all<br>indites have beneficial some toxic<br>indites that occur naturally in New<br>Zealand produce compounds like latr B<br>and these are harmful to animals calling<br>causing conditions like R grass daggers<br>affected animals often have reduce<br>weight gains or neurological harm<br>leading to injury or even some cases<br>death this is not only an economic loss<br>to our Farmers but it severely<br>compromises Animal Welfare so so while<br>we know we need endites it is crucial to<br>have the right strains and researchers<br>are on the hunt for the perfect<br>indify and yes research has left to fit<br>very successful endites like ar37 which<br>have beneficial pest resistant compounds<br>however these aren't perfect and can<br>still pose a risk to Animal Welfare so<br>the hunk<br>continues this is where my research<br>comes in I aim to understand unknown<br>bioactive compounds produced by<br>different EnV indite strains I'm doing<br>this by extracting and fractionating<br>different indite grass associations<br>pulling them apart until I get to<br>individual compounds produced by the<br>fungi I then conduct small animal and<br>insect test to understand the<br>bioactivity of these<br>compounds identifying those that are not<br>safe for animals or those that provide<br>effective piss resistance while being<br>safe for<br>animals and although I can't share my<br>results due to confidentiality I can let<br>you know that things are looking<br>promising at identifying compounds that<br>give insight into the ideal chemical<br>profile for the perfect indify the one<br>that enhances pasture resilience and<br>productivity while being safe for<br>Animals developing such an ight would<br>reduce our Reliance on pesticides<br>improve animal welfare and ensure New<br>Zealand remains a leading and profitable<br>right I could I could go with sheep<br>jokes but I think that goes that goes it<br>gets old pretty quick<br>um I actually have done some work on on<br>Pastor grass not a joke not a joke now<br>everything's a joke um<br>and uh yeah these Ender fights are<br>amazing but yeah um the uh another thing<br>I could say I suppose is<br>that not all forms of meat have the same<br>Greenhouse um gas footprint so that's<br>something for you to think about and<br>something for you guys to do some<br>homework on so maybe go home ask CH<br>GPT um you know what are the relative<br>carbon Footprints of different types of<br>meat you'll be surprised by the answer<br>and but and here's a Hint it it's<br>cost good all right so our next speaker<br>is B Mahi from The Faculty of MDI and<br>Indigenous studies and she's going to<br>talk about how rangatahi growing up in<br>challenging environments can become<br>imagine being born into vibrant health<br>and abundant opportunity with the<br>knowledge you can pursue your dreams and<br>see them through to successful<br>completion this PhD study looked at how<br>alah youth can confidently take<br>advantage of school and work<br>opportunities to succeed in any path<br>they choose in our current political<br>climate the selected coalition<br>government is insisting our most<br>troubled youth require military training<br>well this study focused on arahi growing<br>up within gang space in ALA a provided a<br>platform and exploration into their<br>experiences navigating school and work<br>Pathways it acknowledge their<br>right to claim their home space without<br>stigma or judgment their stories Puro<br>were captured and surrounded by the<br>protective voices of adult who were the<br>same r at one point alongside mothers<br>and members themselves all stories<br>shared were open honest and heartfelt<br>all those I spoke to we're aware of the<br>challenges the selected coalition<br>government is also focal about their<br>tough on gangs approach the study<br>highlights a tough on gang's approach is<br>a tough on family's approach let me tell<br>you for our youth located in these<br>spaces witnessing the ongoing<br>incarceration of their farno members<br>will impact their ability to succeed<br>despite this findings show if bangah and<br>their Foo can make sense of their<br>experiences they have the ability to<br>become powerful agents of change if one<br>can endure and overcome layers of<br>marginalization stigma and judgment<br>institutional and societal racism<br>cultural displacement and dislocation<br>and still manage to achieve to succeed<br>to grow and to prosper W you become a<br>powerful Agent of<br>Change a key another key finding is an<br>ongoing connection to T Mii provides<br>solid grounding for our to<br>succeed again this coalition government<br>is determined to disregard t or Whitey<br>and molding the process under the guise<br>of promoting equality for<br>all the study then is a contribution to<br>this new era with a suppression<br>impression of different groups can no<br>longer be overlooked final<br>acknowledgements to my Faro growing up<br>within a gang affiliated space the study<br>allows me to acknowledge the resilience<br>and Humanity of those navigating complex<br>societal challenges and to recognize we<br>do so with strength courage and the<br>ability to be unapologetically ourselves<br>k<br>I don't have a joke for the last<br>presentation um I will point out though<br>that we are running about 20 minutes<br>ahead of<br>schedule I would like to think it's<br>because the contestants have been<br>wonderful at keeping through their time<br>but I think the reality is because the<br>judges are taking a pity on my ability<br>to maintain more than 2 minutes of<br>speech so they're taking their notes<br>very<br>expediently but<br>nevertheless if the things go ahead go<br>according to schedule you get 20 minutes<br>great last but not least our final<br>finalist for the day um Charlotte Robin<br>Robertson from the School of Engineering<br>she's going to talk about to us about<br>making food makes organic waste there<br>are options to manage these but some<br>wastes are just difficult to deal with<br>like sludges from chicken processing<br>they can be commercially composted but<br>only small quantities paper can be<br>recycled but not if it's contaminated<br>with food normally these wastes are<br>landfilled this is a very poor use of<br>nutrients because globally we Face a<br>dual crisis of widespread nutrient<br>pollution and nutrient<br>deficits we have interrupted nutrient<br>Cycles excess nutrients are not returned<br>to productive soils to make more food<br>instead they are lost to the environment<br>as pollution or landfill as organic<br>wastes so so what is the solution to our<br>nutrient<br>crisis<br>circularity recycling our<br>nutrients for example chicken processing<br>plants produce excess nutrient Rich<br>sludges Farms import fertilizers to<br>replenish nutrients harvested in<br>crops one system has an excess of<br>nutrients the other a deficit but the<br>raw processing sludge is a poor<br>substitute for<br>fertilizer so what is the intermediate<br>step the recycling<br>solution vermac composting earthworms<br>turning organic matter into vermac cast<br>earthworm poo and excellent plant<br>food but earthworms cannot eat raw<br>processing sludge they need a carbon<br>source to create the right balance the<br>bread for the jam sandwich<br>we can divert non-recyclable paper waste<br>from landfill to meet this<br>need I am researching how non-recyclable<br>paper waste and chicken processing<br>sludges can be vermac composted together<br>and how the vermac cast from this can<br>improve food<br>production I need to find the right mix<br>of these resources to produce high<br>quality vermicast at an industrial<br>scale I am also applying vermicast to<br>maze potato es and onions on a<br>commercial Farm I need to know that this<br>vermac cast will improve yield food<br>Quality Storage quality or at least<br>profitability I have just begun data<br>analysis and so far the results are<br>promising I'm on the pathway to creating<br>a practical and sustainable solution to<br>reconnect nutrient Cycles through the<br>integration of food production systems<br>earthworms are the key because making<br>food makes organic<br>resources not waste thank<br>you right I still have to drag out time<br>a little bit because we need to give<br>Charlotte time to get to the seat but I<br>think we can all say that these have<br>been 10 excellent presentations so why<br>don't we give another round of applause<br>to the<br>finalist so before we close for<br>intermission I would like to invite all<br>the finalists to come back on the stage<br>at this time i' would like to invite the<br>judges to um depart and conduct their<br>deliberation<br>so we'll just wait quietly while we they<br>right well before we go into<br>intermission can we just have another<br>round of applause for our 10<br>finalists so as the booklet says um<br>during intermission we're providing<br>light refreshments and a cash bar<br>outside<br>um a final reminder that um voting for<br>People's Choice using the P QR code is<br>open it will stay open until 10 8 um so<br>I guess the 20 minutes you bought I well<br>the judges spot for us um they will be<br>used from engling because I think we<br>have to stick to that timeline um and if<br>again if you don't have your phone or<br>your phone's not working for some reason<br>please um see a member of the school um<br>of graduate research and they can help<br>you they can give you the paper ballot<br>um and please go and enjoy the the U the<br>light refreshment thank you<br>1<br>1<br>m<br>he<br>he<br>he<br>he<br>he<br>where<br>a<br>a<br>he<br>oh<br>welcome back I hope you had a a bit of<br>Kai something to drink maybe but um not<br>if you're driving of course um and we we<br>are now ready to commence with the next<br>portion of our um competition tonight<br>and of course our contestants are<br>already on the stage and right now I'd<br>like to welcome our judges as well as um<br>K so I will get straight to this there's<br>no point<br>dithering the first award to be<br>announced tonight is um People's Choice<br>Award to be presented by Professor Tangy<br>the next award is the runner up to be<br>Sharp and I'm not going to mix up the<br>envelopes the winner is Zane Sheeran<br>from the school of psychological and<br>social sciences<br>the next award is actually not in the<br>program because the judges had a really<br>hard time so we are<br>awarding um<br>another additional award for highly<br>commended to be presented by sh um<br>Shelly<br>C everybody um we're judges who don't<br>like to follow the rules so um I was<br>asked to stand and speak about why we<br>did a highly commended award this<br>evening to Bonnie a little bit different<br>and we believe there's never been a more<br>important time for our academics and<br>researchers to Stand and Deliver um what<br>is the evidence about those great social<br>issues that we have in our communities<br>and Society so that our policy and<br>practice and our decision makers don't<br>rely on political ideology alone that we<br>need you to stand and present the<br>evidence and the research and data uh<br>about what harms and also what heals our<br>and before we announce the final award<br>I'd like to invite wiu PUK um to talk<br>award<br>um the scariest committee I've ever gone<br>up against Cas is called the ATI<br>committee I have an ATI committee on my<br>m<br>I think they're more scarier than anyone<br>else but anyway now that I've reached<br>that age I'll probably be on the uncle's<br>committee trying to keep the aunti<br>committee in check best of luck for me<br>for that I just going to talk briefly<br>about professor John<br>McCraw uh Professor McCraw was a emitus<br>professor of Sciences in the time I knew<br>but he was also one of the foundation<br>professors of this University in the<br>area of<br>Sciences I first met Professor mcro<br>while I was giving a demonstration of<br>the use of traditional making Stone<br>ansers and tools at the white C Museum<br>in<br>1995 he set in the armchair in the top<br>gallery and watched for 6<br>hours me flaking obsidian uh all sorts<br>of array of stone in terms of Reviving<br>the traditional ancient techniques on<br>how stone tools were used by by Mar<br>before European<br>Conta so into Italy the trophy that I<br>carved is a replic<br>of one of the British museum which I<br>entirely carv with greenstone chisel and<br>STS but it's also a<br>symbol of a town or<br>treasure that was usually held by the to<br>Aura the most esteemed toonga or priest<br>of the old<br>world who uh officiated aside our<br>ancient schools of L the<br>F so it's a symb symbolic acknowledge<br>M of that uh the learnings of the F wild<br>which is the equivalent of a<br>university so the um I got a good mind<br>to go to London actually and swap it<br>take my one over and swap it for the<br>real one and bring it back they would<br>know uh but I also like to acknowledge<br>Professor Lee for your MC tonight and I<br>I enjoy your humor I think you like<br>going to get on really<br>well uh<br>so I we F to I'd like to also<br>acknowledge the long-suffering moms and<br>dads boyfriends<br>girlfriends uh<br>Partners but for your support of these<br>wonderful<br>students that's a doing a PhD is not<br>easy but certainly the the dedication<br>the perseverance and focus and<br>commitment on such a high level of<br>Academia and you would be the FL you<br>we're proud to have you as part of this<br>University<br>so those are just my brief words and um<br>Professor<br>Lee<br>G thank you would for that wonderful Cod<br>at all um and now for the overall<br>winner the overall winner of the<br>University of wo 2024<br>three minute the doctoral thesis<br>on behalf of the school of graduate<br>research and the University of wo I'd<br>like to thank the judges Willam muuk and<br>all the finalists for attending<br>tonight's competition um I think every<br>single presentation was award worthy<br>which I know was a very made it very<br>very difficult for the judges um and I<br>Al of course like to thank every single<br>one of you for attending this event um<br>your support means a lot to especially<br>to those on the stage um so as a final<br>i' like to have another round of<br>applause before we close for the night<br>um for the<br>contestants and now I'd like to invite<br>my friend fetu Tako to um give us the<br>event uh thank you all when much of our<br>attention's been focused on our um<br>physical athletes overseas um it's good<br>to come here this evening and uh listen<br>well thank you every everyone safe<br>a</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
