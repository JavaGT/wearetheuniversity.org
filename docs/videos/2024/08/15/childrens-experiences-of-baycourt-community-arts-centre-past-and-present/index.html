This lecture reports on a project that put children’s experiences of the performing arts centre stage at Baycourt Community and Arts Centre.<br><br>Coinciding with the theatre’s 40th anniversary last year, Dr Bronya Dean and Professor Lynda Johnston undertook a two-phase research project, speaking with adults about their childhood memories of Baycourt (phase 1) and speaking with children who also drew about their experiences of Baycourt (phase 2). Bronya and Lynda share some of their findings and discuss the role a community venue plays in the lives of children and the development of cultural citizenship.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

pointers to ensure<br>that you have an enjoyable time here<br>tonight<br>uh we have um just check your phones<br>that they're on silent thank you um<br>either switched off or silent take a<br>moment to locate your nearest exit which<br>may be behind you um which will be<br>behind you and these are indicated with<br>the green exit signs on the two doors<br>that you came into we also have an exit<br>along here beside us uh the toilets are<br>located outside and and left down the<br>end of the corridor turn left we a smoke<br>free venue and finally if there is a<br>very unlikely event of an emergency just<br>ask and follow um our<br>instructions uh the staff will tell you<br>where to assemble on level one so that<br>is the housekeeping issues out of the<br>way so it gives me great pleasure now to<br>introduce uh the lead researcher for<br>this project Dr bronine is a lecturer<br>at toy Tong the division of education<br>and Bron's research focus focuses on the<br>musical experiences of<br>children uh at home and in the community<br>she has a professional background in<br>arts<br>management and early childhood music<br>education her research interests stradle<br>these areas now Bron's doctoral research<br>uh explored the spontaneous singing of<br>three and four-year-old children at<br>home and how they use singing as a tool<br>of<br>agency recent projects include an<br>inquiry into professional musicians<br>performing in early childhood education<br>settings and international collaboration<br>investig investigating mothers<br>perceptions of their infant directed<br>musical activities and an analysis of<br>infants musical experiences from data<br>collection<br>from data collected as part of the<br>growing up in New Zealand longitudinal<br>studies you may recognize Bron also<br>particularly if you're a family member<br>of hers but also because um<br>She Wonderful support here also she is<br>chair of the Opus Orchestra trust and<br>president of the youth pH harmonic Tonga<br>and a playing member of the Bay of<br>Plenty Symphonia now I know she's<br>probably cringing at that long<br>introduction but I'm really delighted to<br>be working with to uh with Bron here in<br>Tonga on a topic that was quite new to<br>me so I'm learning a lot from you so<br>I'll introduce<br>Johnson I'm a professor of geography<br>here<br>at my research focuses primarily on<br>Spaces of belonging and often for people<br>who uh who are marginalized due to their<br>age or gender or sexuality migrant<br>status Etc I recently was named fellow<br>a of the Royal Society of altero for my<br>research uh within the social and<br>Behavioral Sciences I've had the role of<br>president for the New Zealand<br>geographical society and I'm currently<br>New Zealand's representative for the<br>international geographical Union some of<br>you may be wondering what's a geographer<br>revealed so we will for how this<br>presentation will run we will both speak<br>to the content and we are dying to hear<br>your uh feedback on this uh particular<br>uh research project so we'll be opening<br>up for questions and comments at the<br>end and we're sharing with you today<br>some of the research about the role of<br>our very own Performing Arts venue uh<br>Bay Court in the lives of children and<br>young people and this is an<br>interdisciplinary study looking at the F<br>at the influence of place on young<br>people and vice<br>versa we're really excited to share this<br>research with you um because well we're<br>right based here within tarong Moana and<br>it's fantastic to see um our young<br>members here as well some of the artists<br>are in the room uh as part of the<br>project so the study was inspired by<br>three converging factors the 40th<br>anniversary of Bay Court local<br>government policy on arts and culture<br>and the development of tataki<br>Ora concept for the Central<br>City to you thank<br>you thank you so um yeah the inspiration<br>for this study there was three<br>Inspirations um the first was this event<br>um when I was 9 years old in 1983 I my<br>family and hundreds of others lined the<br>we were outside the racecourse along<br>Cameron Road opposite Green Park School<br>waving to Princess Diana and Prince<br>Charles as they came to open Bay<br>Court um and I vividly remember that day<br>and also the first time I went to bayt<br>which was to a production of it was<br>called the great wol I don't I know they<br>had really fancy dresses um The Great<br>wol and which was probably put on by a<br>predecessor of um TOA musical theater I<br>think um and from then then until I left<br>TOA to go to university most of or many<br>of my experiences in the Performing Arts<br>both as an audience member and um a<br>performer took place in<br>bort so 20123 marked as um Linda said<br>marked the 40th anniversary of bort um<br>borts owned and run by TOA city council<br>um and it's our largest full service the<br>the theatrical venue um and our primary<br>performing space for um both visiting<br>Productions and um uh Community<br>Productions<br>um and so so there's a lot of a lot of<br>um annual events also take place in in<br>vay Court like the jazz festival the<br>performing arts<br>competitions um school productions all<br>those sorts of things Bank Court's<br>predominantly a venue for hire um it<br>only has a small budget to put towards<br>programming um the early official<br>booking policy is to prioritize Arts<br>events over non-arts events such as<br>conferences um there are no targets<br>relating to community versus commercial<br>um content but local um nonprofit<br>organizations and local organizations<br>that put on events for children and<br>young people get a 50% discount on the<br>booking um fee so the main auditorium at<br>bort as I'm sure you all know I has I'm<br>assuming everyone's been to bort at some<br>point um is is<br>585 um and which is very small and it's<br>recognized as a bit inadequate for the<br>size of our city now so when bot was<br>built um the population of toing was<br>about 53,000 and now it's tripled that<br>at about 160 nearly 162,000 so it's very<br>small for the population<br>um and because of its small size it<br>makes it uneconomic for some larger<br>touring Productions so they end up not<br>coming so bort has now been the main<br>Performing Arts venue in tider um for<br>more than a Generation Um and it's much<br>loved by many in the<br>community um wats and all uh based on my<br>own based on my own experiences um and<br>my fondness for Bott my memories of Bott<br>um I realized that for people my people<br>my age and younger um many will have um<br>a lot of memories about their<br>experiences in Bay Court um so that was<br>the first inspiration uh the second<br>inspiration was um the development of<br>the city council's arts culture and<br>Heritage action and investment plan<br>which is a bit of a mouthful um 2023 to<br>2033 last year so back in 2018 uh toing<br>city council and Western Bay U Regional<br>District Council sorry um worked with<br>creative Bay of Plenty to put together a<br>three-year um arts and culture<br>strategy from it was quite it was quite<br>thorough but from my perspective as a uh<br>music educator and researcher the major<br>weakness of that strategy was the<br>absence of children and young people in<br>fact children are only mentioned were<br>only mentioned once in the entire<br>document and that was that was in<br>relation to the intention to map their<br>participation now I understood a mapping<br>exercise did take place but it only<br>collected data from Secondary School<br>students not not younger children um and<br>the findings have not been acted upon as<br>far as I know so when that that strategy<br>was reviewed and that fed into the new<br>Arts culture and Heritage action and<br>investment plan but disappointingly<br>children are also absent from that plan<br>um the plan the new plan acknowledges<br>that there's potential to engage young<br>people in the Arts and that the Arts can<br>have a positive impact on the well-being<br>of children and young people but there<br>are no action points specifically<br>relating to Children young people or<br>families in the<br>Arts so by investigating the experiences<br>children have had and continued to have<br>at Bay Court we hope to highlight the<br>importance of including and Consulting<br>with children and young people in future<br>strategy when that's next reviewed<br>hopefully not hopefully sooner than 33<br>in<br>fact my<br>turn switch off um the final inspiration<br>for the study was uh the recent<br>commitment of Tonga city council to the<br>Redevelopment of the area around Bay<br>Court into a Civic Precinct so man Ora<br>focusing on cultural uh culture and<br>Heritage so this new site or this new<br>plans will include uh a Library Museum<br>exhibition space Civic meeting space the<br>renovation of Bay Court and potentially<br>in the future a conference venue and a<br>Performing Art<br>Center now we are very excited about<br>this because as the campus is very close<br>to this uh particular uh Civic Precinct<br>so we've been keeping an eye on<br>it t Ora is concerned with future Arts<br>and Cultural strategies and we believe<br>it is vitally important that children's<br>experiences of the arts and culture are<br>considered during all stages of this<br>development<br>process so the overall aim of This<br>research project was to explore the role<br>that Bott has played and continues to<br>play in the lives of children in our<br>city that's a really beautiful<br>photo of of Linda and I with um shaana<br>who is here sh Ste who was our research<br>um assistant our summer scholar um and<br>she worked on with us on the first stage<br>of the project and we've actually had<br>two other um research assistants as well<br>um Jenny cross who helped us um with the<br>work with the children and Lisa Steed<br>who sort of put together the um displays<br>out in the<br>foer<br>I uh no you talked about the aims<br>yes existing literature let me just<br>spend a few moments talking about what<br>has already been done in this field so<br>children's experiences and Performing<br>Arts venues is the literature on this is<br>quite limited there's some research<br>about children attending a theater uh<br>and live music but this usually focuses<br>on their experience of the event rather<br>than their holisticals<br>experience per se<br>children and museums have received more<br>attention for example uh you can see on<br>the slide there haget and others at<br>Sheffield Helm University have written<br>about young children interacting with<br>Museum spaces uh prelli has written<br>about Children's Museum experiences in<br>Australia and in terms of the role of<br>Arts venues in cities we're influenced<br>to some extent by sociologist Eric<br>clintberg uh particularly the book on on<br>palaces for the people and also by we're<br>influenced by geographers Ellen leam and<br>Jake Leighton who discussed the<br>importance of community spaces or social<br>infrastructure and affording<br>opportunities for people to interact and<br>build<br>you so we're particularly interested in<br>the concept of cultural citizenship and<br>how that relates to children so cultural<br>citizenship relates recognizes that to<br>fully belong in a society um you need to<br>be able to experience culture belonging<br>not just political<br>citizenship um and this is enshrined in<br>article 29 of the UN Declaration of<br>Human Rights everyone has the right<br>freely to participate in the cultural<br>life of the community to enjoy the Arts<br>and to share in scientific advancement<br>and its<br>benefits um an intention to uh develop<br>children as active citizens is also<br>expressed in the New Zealand curriculum<br>through the key competency participating<br>and contrib contributing which states<br>students who participate and contribute<br>in communities have a sense of belonging<br>and a confidence to participate within<br>new<br>contexts supporting children to become<br>active citizens um requires an<br>understanding of how that process works<br>how de um citizenship identities develop<br>so being too young to vote um children<br>are marginalized by the idea that<br>citizenship is only about political<br>rights and<br>responsibilities um for children to um<br>children's understanding of what it<br>means to be a citizen is develops in<br>relation to their um experiences of<br>belonging in<br>communities so one of the ways that<br>children and young people can experience<br>that Bel belonging and develop cultural<br>identities as obviously through the<br>Performing Arts the Performing Arts<br>provide um opportunities for children to<br>explore what we call possible selves so<br>the people they could become and through<br>the Arts they can try on identities um<br>and explore values and<br>relationships um this the Performing<br>Arts also facilitates social bonding and<br>group<br>identity um and that enables children to<br>experience a strong sense of belonging<br>in Community Arts education researchers<br>argue that education in the Arts enables<br>children and young people to participate<br>in the cultural life of their<br>communities connect with cultural<br>institutions um engage in Social and<br>cultural meaning<br>making um and these experience active<br>participating in their communities helps<br>them develop their as cultural citizens<br>so we were interested to find out about<br>how um experiences in Bay Court have<br>influenced children not just as<br>individuals but also as cultural<br>citizens in relation to their<br>city so the project has as we mentioned<br>already two separate phases uh of the<br>research each for each phase we uh<br>received eth ethical approval from the<br>University phase one We examined adults<br>memories of their experiences of bay<br>cortt as children and in phase two we<br>explored children's experiences both as<br>performers and as audience members and<br>we ask them about their ideas for the<br>future now the two phras phases are are<br>different so we'll talk about them SE<br>separately phase one um is about<br>remembering<br>childhood and um hearing from adults<br>about their childhood experiences that<br>they remember from in and from Bott<br>remembering is a process of making sense<br>of the past in the context of the<br>present and of constructing a<br>relationship between the past and the<br>present so for us this was a really<br>useful uh way to look at the phenomena<br>through memory as we can identify what<br>was important to the particip<br>and through remembering our participants<br>construct a<br>narrative uh themselves about their<br>experiences at Bay Court and what the<br>meaning of those experiences are to<br>their<br>lives got one more uh<br>recruitment oh was that<br>me okay so for this phase of the study<br>we interviewed our main the main data<br>was collected through interviewing<br>people in focus groups in interviews but<br>we actually started the recruitment for<br>this through a survey so the survey um<br>went out through the ba cour B Bay Court<br>mailing list and through Facebook posts<br>the main purpose of the survey was to<br>recruit participants to be um you know<br>take part in the interviews and the<br>focus groups but we did include two long<br>answer questions um what was your most<br>memorable experience at Bay Court as a<br>child or teenager and what made this<br>experience special or especially<br>memorable so 76 people completed the<br>survey 53 of those had experienced bort<br>as a child or teenager and 52 of those<br>um so most of those provided a written<br>response to th those longans<br>questions um so and so that that<br>actually became our first set of data<br>and our um summer scholar the wonderful<br>Shana um analyzed those responses for as<br>part of her summer scholarship and she<br>produced this um award-winning post<br>she won the you know prize for the best<br>poster of Summer Scholars um about that<br>so she identified five themes from that<br>that that that data belonging emotional<br>response Family Support sense of<br>peers<br>um another<br>one yeah you me here you can see on this<br>on this slide in addition to the survey<br>we recruited participants through social<br>media Facebook posts and Word of Mouth<br>uh we held two face-to-face focus groups<br>one online focus group and six<br>individual interviews online so for this<br>phase of the research there were 13<br>adult participants now the focus group<br>interviews were about an hour long and<br>the individual interviews were a bit<br>shorter 30 to 40 minutes and you can see<br>on that slide the demographics of the<br>people that we uh talk to in these<br>groups and apart from two<br>participants uh uh had experence two<br>participants had experienced bayt as<br>adults all the participants had both<br>performed and attended events at bayt as<br>children there are themes from this part<br>of the uh project four broad themes you<br>can see their schools act as a pathway<br>facilitating Equitable access to B Bay<br>Court participants felt a sense of<br>belonging at bayt bayt is a space that<br>supports developing performance<br>identities and child or adolescent<br>adolescent experiences at B were lasting<br>and<br>transformative so one of the things that<br>became immediately obvious um it came<br>through really strongly was this idea of<br>schools being a pathway into performing<br>at vac Court<br>um in the even in the survey um 17 of<br>the survey respondents described their<br>most memorable experience at bayt was<br>something that they had experienced<br>through school so that was like being in<br>a school show or or be or visiting Bay<br>Court actually on a school trip um all<br>the people we interviewed as Linda said<br>had performed who had performed at Bay<br>Court had taken part in a Secondary<br>School production so um either on the<br>stage as actors um or in the in the pit<br>in the band um and other opportunities<br>that were presented apart from the<br>Secondary School production other<br>opportunities for secondary school<br>students were the youth Jazz competition<br>and the terang Tanga jazz festival stage<br>Challenge and rock Quest now music<br>teachers um obviously played a um<br>significant role in enabling this<br>between the school and the um and Bay<br>Court and several music teachers were me<br>mentioned a number of<br>times um a few participants that also um<br>experienced performing at bort as<br>primary school children through their<br>primary schools um and that was through<br>the Performing Arts uh sorry the primary<br>schools Music Festival the choir<br>Festival um and also through private<br>dance schools dance shows and um the<br>performing arts<br>competitions being able to access spay<br>Court through school is really important<br>from a social justice and Equity P<br>perspective through schools children who<br>can't afford their families can't AFF<br>afford private dance lessons or m music<br>lessons um they can experience um you<br>know they can achieve Equitable access<br>and the and and this highlights how<br>important bort how important it is that<br>bay cortt remains affordable and<br>accessible to<br>schools even though for B it probably<br>seems like there's a flood of schools<br>wanting to use the venue it is actually<br>really<br>important um the sense of belong was a<br>theme from this material we uh from the<br>people that we interviewed they had all<br>performed and bayau multiple times with<br>many returning year after uh every year<br>for a number of years to perform in<br>dance shows Performing Arts competition<br>youth jazz festival School shows some<br>spending significant amounts of time<br>there many of the participants described<br>knowing the place well and even going so<br>far to describe bot as a second home<br>and so in addition to this familiarity<br>the participants also developed a sense<br>of a belonging through working with<br>like-minded peers and supportive adults<br>from the survey one person said coming<br>from a small rural school just outside<br>of toonga it was incredibly energizing<br>and validating to spend a whole day<br>surrounded by my like-minded peers the<br>Arts uh were not often a priority at my<br>high school and it was such a relief to<br>be in a space where they were valued so<br>a sense of belonging there was evident<br>when participants mentioned the<br>relationships formed at bayt for some<br>this was connecting with same people in<br>the competitions each year for others it<br>was the bonds formed with peers during<br>that annual dance school<br>shows for some it involved physical<br>relationships and between our surveys<br>and our interviews we had more than one<br>participant tell us that they had their<br>first at<br>bort um as one participant said uh uh to<br>think of all those people that I still<br>uh this many years on have been<br>connected to in some way it's just so<br>fascinating how the Arts really do bring<br>people<br>together the participants described how<br>performing at Bay Court working along<br>working with the professional technical<br>team and some cases working alongside<br>professional performers um that allowed<br>them to envisage what it might be like<br>to be a professional performer um they<br>could try on they were able to try on<br>more mature performing Performing Arts<br>identities at bayt than they could in<br>their school hall because of the<br>professional<br>atmosphere um one participant described<br>feeling like you're really doing a<br>professional sort of gig rather than<br>just a school show and she went on to<br>say that performing at bort gave her the<br>opportunity to think all this might be a<br>real thing that I could do with my life<br>and actually that person did go on to<br>become a<br>performer um so the professional status<br>of bort was seen as a stepping stone<br>into a more growing up world of<br>Performing uh oh that's the wrong one um<br>the participants also described aspects<br>of their experiences at Bay Court that<br>had a lasting impact on their lives so<br>this could be one of sort of trans<br>informational light bulb moments um or<br>experiences that contributed to personal<br>growth and a perceived widening of<br>perspectives widening of Horizons so<br>performing at um Bay Court the<br>participants said it improved their<br>confidence helped them to learn to be a<br>good sport to deal with nerves to be<br>courageous um and it made them more<br>independent many of our participants<br>continue to be involved um now in their<br>growing up lives in the Arts um as<br>performers teachers and arts management<br>or have continued their involvement um<br>in an amate capacity and we thought this<br>U quote was rather nice from one of our<br>interviewees um just having bort there<br>as a kind of central part of Tanga and<br>just how you felt when you performed<br>there like you were doing something<br>meaningful and you know contributing<br>well it was pretty I think important I<br>would go so far as to say it impacted my<br>whole<br>life that was phase one now to phase two<br>um and we FOC focused in this next part<br>on the perspectives of children at Bay<br>Court and to do this we used drawing as<br>a method as you can see from outside to<br>elicit conversation with 5 to 12<br>year-old children about their<br>experiences in bayot as audience and or<br>as<br>performers drawing is becoming<br>increasingly common as an arts-based<br>research method drawing can either be<br>used as a data source in its own right<br>uh where the drawings are interpreted by<br>the researcher or as a method to elicit<br>conversation and Al is the second<br>approach uh we use it as a method to<br>elicit conversation there is quite a a<br>solid body of literature around<br>arts-based research you can see the book<br>there arts-based methods for research<br>with children um I have used drawing in<br>some of my research uh but that was with<br>adults and this was the first time that<br>Bron used any sort of art based data<br>collection method um so this was a<br>learning uh process for us we recruited<br>participants uh by handing out flyers to<br>parents and children who attended shows<br>at<br>BT um thank you Bay Court staff for<br>leing us loer in the lobby and the um we<br>were recruiting when the shows were<br>either aimed at children or in which<br>children uh were performing so you can<br>see on that slide some of the shows we<br>targeted we also use social media<br>posts and this slide shows you the um<br>overview of the participants that we<br>recruited um and you can see their 19<br>participants the ages the gender<br>breakdown ethnicity uh 10 of the<br>children had performed at Bay cortt nine<br>had attended as audience members we did<br>Five Focus Group drawing sessions and we<br>okay so in our drawing and the drawing<br>sessions were um that took about an hour<br>um we started off with introductions and<br>then we did a bit of a warmup um which<br>was based on squiggler techniques<br>squiggler is just a creative Mark making<br>program that was developed through<br>ockland art gallery and Oakland<br>univiversity<br>so this is just sort of Mark making<br>lines and squiggles and dots um and so<br>we did that exploring different colors<br>and we shared our pages and draw on each<br>other's Pages just to get to know each<br>other it sort of broke the ice a bit<br>after that we talked to the children<br>about their experiences in bort um and<br>like Linda said that 10 of them had been<br>performers some of those performers some<br>of those 10 children had performed and<br>Baugh multiple times some were already<br>quite seasoned performers um and nine<br>had experienced B through being in the<br>audience um so we talked about how that<br>felt and then we asked them to draw to<br>draw to try and draw how it felt to be<br>in bort uh and we talked about their so<br>so actually in the foyer the the<br>drawings on the smaller um display board<br>the double-sided one is uh their<br>expressions of how it felt to be in<br>bord um and we talked about their<br>favorite experiences and their favorite<br>moments in bort then we asked them to<br>draw fresh piece of paper asked them to<br>draw their ideal performance space um<br>from their<br>imagination<br>uh so yeah we we found the children were<br>really happy to talk once they got<br>drawing they were really happy to talk<br>about their experiences and their ideas<br>we had a few backup sort of prompt<br>questions to ask if we needed them um we<br>often<br>didn't uh so in relation to their<br>experiences um the<br>children we talked a lot about emotions<br>actually what it what it felt like many<br>felt excited and happy excited and happy<br>were the main things um and the children<br>who had been performers also nervous was<br>was the other main feeling I did a<br>little word cloud of all the of all the<br>feelings um we had from the performers<br>we had don't want it to finish uh we had<br>don't know what to expect I don't know<br>what the audience will think I don't<br>know if I'll do it right so whole sort<br>of um<br>uncertainty um some of the performers<br>were proud some felt encouraged enaged<br>when they saw their family and teachers<br>in the<br>audience um occasionally they got bored<br>it was quite boring waiting backstage<br>you wait a long time<br>backstage um one performer had performed<br>so many times in Bay Court that she felt<br>calm and she was put in charge of a of a<br>group of dancers and she felt<br>responsible um sometimes performers felt<br>confused it's very can be very busy<br>backstage for some of those those shows<br>and the audience<br>um the children were surprised<br>impressed tired it got late<br>sometimes um and again sometimes in the<br>audience it could be boring as<br>well uh the children also spoke about as<br>well as the emotions they spoke about<br>the physical space so the seating um<br>whether it was comfortable or not<br>whether the seats try and grab you when<br>they fold up um the lights the lights<br>were really impressive uh The Green Room<br>how busy it was backstage how the<br>audience behaved some people were a bit<br>critical about how the audience<br>behaved um and of course the<br>refreshments it's always nice to have an<br>ice cream so you can look at those um<br>pictures in the in the foyer and on on<br>all the pictures we've written a little<br>caption and we've tried our best to sum<br>up the essence of what the children were<br>telling us in that little<br>caption so then we asked the children to<br>draw an imagin place where they would<br>like to perform or watch a performance<br>so if you could create your own<br>performance space and your own<br>performance what would it be like or<br>um yeah so most of the children worked<br>within their existing understanding of<br>what a theater is so we had lots of red<br>curtains lights um and often they added<br>something they improved it in some way<br>or made it more um suitable for for them<br>um some of the children imagined<br>themselves as performers and in the<br>pictures some of them have put<br>themselves on the stage and some of them<br>have put something on the stage that<br>they'd like to watch as an audience<br>member but and some of them have been<br>very specific on here you can see that<br>somebody has an Elvis Presley show that<br>was and someone another drawing there's<br>Matilda and another one there's an<br>animal acrobatic show so something<br>specific they wanted to see but often<br>they spoke about both which is not<br>really reflected in the in in the in the<br>in the drawings they spoke about being a<br>a performer and an audience member<br>so reviewing the drawingss and the<br>conversations that we had about them we<br>noticed four recurring ideas four themes<br>the first was<br>accessibility audience<br>experience unconventional performance<br>spaces and providing alternative<br>themes so several of the children<br>considered how accessible their theater<br>would be in terms of their physical<br>access and affordability in some cases<br>and this included having the theater uh<br>close to their house so they could<br>easily walk there consideration was also<br>given to parents with fidgety children<br>for example several children provided um<br>monitors so parents who had to take<br>their children out of the theater could<br>continue to watch the show while having<br>their children<br>outside um<br>another good example of accessibility<br>comes from Tula tula's ideal performance<br>space was outside and she spoke about<br>wanting it to be not too<br>pricey more friendly so that anyone can<br>attend and and allowing people to come<br>and go as they please Tula spoke about<br>having different seating options people<br>could sit on the grass or in recliner<br>seats like at the movies she also<br>provided Refreshments in the form of<br>food trucks that would be close enough<br>so you could get the food easily without<br>show yeah yeah oh sorry you did it sorry<br>um the children considered the audiences<br>Comfort making their spaces welcoming<br>and by providing comfortable seating<br>food and ensuring the audience had a<br>good view so in this picture this is I<br>thought was a good example of this Josh<br>um this is a picture by Josh he is an<br>experienced audience member at Bay cortt<br>he's gone to a lot of things and his<br>ideas as you can see from the picture<br>his ideas just came thick and fast he<br>was having the ideas faster than he<br>could actually draw them so he um has<br>got all sorts of different seating and<br>his idea was that you know there was<br>lots of different options in seating<br>because everybody's different and might<br>like a different sort of seat so he's<br>got warm lounges at the front there then<br>he's got weird shaped seats in case<br>you're feeling weird um he's got bean<br>bags uh and then he's got wheelchairs<br>places for Wheelchairs and I think<br>inspired by the seats the chairs that we<br>were using in when when we were doing<br>the workshop and we had wheelie chairs<br>so he had wheelie chairs as well was the<br>idea that if you're in a wheelie chair<br>you can sort of move to get a bit view<br>or a different perspective of the show<br>uh he's also got oh and at the at the<br>back there's Len seats that have little<br>screens so the people who are far back<br>can see better on their little screen<br>so lots of lots of stuff there around<br>audience experience um and of course<br>there would be yummy<br>food uh many of the spaces uh were also<br>multi-purpose so it could be used for a<br>whole range of different things um and<br>several were<br>Outdoors um and Outdoors performances<br>like we saw in tula's one before allowed<br>um better access but Al sort of<br>Equitable access for all sorts of people<br>um and actually Tula the one we saw<br>before she actually me specifically<br>mentioned children and the elderly she<br>was particularly interested in them um<br>but uh yeah so in this drawing you can't<br>tell this from the drawing but um as<br>Molly was drawing this she was telling<br>us that her theater would have movable<br>walls and a roof so it can open up when<br>it's sunny and close when it's rainy to<br>make the most of the beautiful weather<br>dry and another thing from this material<br>was about alternative activities and<br>several of the children planned options<br>for people to as we heard already to<br>move about or leave the show if they<br>were bored uh they also were also aware<br>of people not ruining the show for<br>others by blocking that view or talking<br>too loudly one child created seats where<br>if you were bored you could press a<br>button and get ejected into a tunnel<br>that takes you to a gaming room and then<br>at the end of the show you just whooshed<br>back so no one knows you gone exactly<br>another provided a space for children to<br>play with a TV monitor so parents<br>supervising children could also watch<br>the performance some included other<br>leisure activities nearby uh such as a<br>swimming pool or playground um the the<br>image you have on the slide here um is<br>another fabulous example example and you<br>can see in this particular uh drawing<br>that uh Sophia has imagined a kids area<br>that has a little stage of its own some<br>dress up clothes and props for children<br>to use it also has a books and uh has<br>stand thank you so when we first started<br>planning this project we wanted to know<br>about how community art space like bort<br>contributed to shaping the Performing<br>Arts identities of children and young<br>people what we've found is that the<br>experience that children and young<br>people Heaven bayau can be profoundly<br>influential and formative on a personal<br>level so the powerful emotions there's a<br>lot of powerful emotions that go on<br>particularly when you're<br>performing and those create strong and<br>Lasting connections both to the space<br>and to the as well as to the people<br>you're with um which I think is why so<br>many people in the community are so fond<br>of bort they've develop those really<br>strong<br>connections um however more importantly<br>the experiences children and young<br>people have in bayau help them develop<br>connections with their community and<br>allow them to feel part of their<br>city um it was particularly interesting<br>for us to see how the children and our<br>focus groups put a real emphasis on<br>inclusion we were just amazed how much<br>they thought about other people's<br>comfort and breaking down barriers and<br>presumably the barriers that they<br>themselves have experienced<br>so um they and they've had they've had a<br>good experience at bod and they want<br>that to be available to other people um<br>and so removing the barriers like cost<br>you know probably you know lots of the<br>children have said oh parents have said<br>oh we can't go to that that's so<br>expensive so they've said they they want<br>it to be to be cheap or free um you know<br>putting it close to their home like we<br>mentioned being able to have a good view<br>of the show not having to sit still all<br>those things are are related to<br>inclusivity<br>so we're Amazed by that sort of thinking<br>about um thinking about those things um<br>This research shows that we can view<br>bort as a connecting space a space that<br>connects people with each other and with<br>the wider community so it acts as a<br>Connecting Point um between children's<br>everyday sites of cultural participation<br>so by everyday sites of cultural<br>participation we mean um home school um<br>anywhere where children consume and<br>create cultures uh even and the dance<br>schools the the music lessons those<br>sorts of places and bort connects those<br>places to The Wider Community by<br>facilitating experiences that expand<br>those everyday that everyday cultural<br>participation and through enabling a<br>strong sense of belonging um to a public<br>venue bort ex as a site for the<br>development of cultural<br>citizenship This research highlights how<br>important it is that children and young<br>people are able to access Bay Court and<br>that this access needs to be Equitable<br>and in inclusive so as many children and<br>young people as possible can benefit<br>from the opportunities that Bay Court<br>can offer having an intentional focus on<br>including children and young people will<br>have a lasting impact on the Performing<br>Arts and toonga for generations to come<br>thank<br>you so we just want to thank a couple of<br>people before we take questions we are<br>going to take questions so big big thank<br>you to our participants the people who<br>filled in the survey maybe some of you<br>fil here filled in the survey the adult<br>participants who came to the interviews<br>and focus groups the children some of<br>have come along the children and their<br>parents for bringing them um Bay Court<br>staff um thanks so much um toer city<br>council supported us with some funding<br>for our summer scholar and also the<br>university strategic research fund<br>supported us um for the second phase of<br>the study um and thank you all for<br>questions any questions yes oh<br>good<br>yes just in terms of a child's age is<br>there a critical period that is been<br>official the<br>child be exposed<br>to the<br>audience so the question I'm just repeat<br>that sorry Bo can hear is is there a<br>critical time for a child uh to be<br>experiencing uh performance<br>um as you mean as a performer as a<br>performer or audience as a perform yeah<br>yeah well if you think we we we've we<br>spoke to children as young as<br>five um and um the adults spoke a lot<br>about what had happened when they were<br>teenagers at secondary school and it was<br>it's all all obviously influential so I<br>I would<br>say so but the thing is if children we<br>don't get as adults we actually don't<br>get that many opportunities to start<br>being performers perhaps you know we get<br>busy with our lives and things and I<br>mean you could join a um you know<br>amateur Dramatics group or something but<br>I think it's really important that<br>children there is research that shows if<br>children have um attended the Arts as<br>children then they're more likely to<br>continue being involved in the Arts and<br>yeah so not not really a critical age<br>but yeah childhood childhood on on that<br>sliding scale childhood adolescence yeah<br>questions reiterate the<br>question um so sh's asking if this has<br>inspired uh any further research<br>um uh uh in a way the research project<br>that I'm hoping to move on to next that<br>I'm actually starting is actually with<br>an Arts organization looking at how that<br>organization works with um<br>children um so it's sort of linked but<br>um not as a space I haven't got anything<br>yeah and we also we have such amazing<br>Rich material from this particular<br>project we feel like we've got plenty to<br>get on with at the moment um the lecture<br>here we're we're giving today is just<br>one of of many ways in which we're<br>Distributing the results of the of the<br>research and there'll be more writing up<br>of it to come and more Publications as<br>well yeah sha did it inspire<br>you come and tell us um well it inspired<br>me um I studied political science at and<br>I just finished um but I was taking into<br>Master good um or looking at going into<br>the art sector and the policy side<br>that's something I would like<br>to nice excellent<br>cool um you talked about how the theat<br>too<br>small and I'm a dancer and so we don't<br>get ballet here EX on T so are they<br>looking<br>atat well I don't I don't think they<br>will<br>in I don't know what what the plans for<br>bort uh I know there's plans for<br>renovation but I'm looking at the bay<br>cortt manager at the<br>back but I'm not going to put her on the<br>spot but um in the original plans for<br>Toano orapa the Civic development um<br>there was a conference and Performing<br>Arts Center on the other side opposite<br>of the road opposite Bay Court I noticed<br>in the last thing I read that had sort<br>of dropped off the plan um we can only<br>hope that that might come back I don't<br>know it's all money isn't it so when<br>you're people use this and you're<br>looking at the equity and the funding<br>where are you looking have you g on next<br>you get more funding from you're go<br>counil govern that's the council's<br>job but can I just say there are<br>elections and um and please look at the<br>people who are standing for local body<br>elections here and um make your decision<br>accordingly yes and creative B plenty<br>put out a very helpful um they they send<br>a questionnaire to all the candidates<br>asking what their policies were or what<br>their um interests were around the Arts<br>useful I don't know sorry<br>council well TOA city council use our<br>findings they've been sent um a report<br>from the first stage of the um research<br>um because they were a funer of that and<br>they will receive when I've written it a<br>report on the second phase um I don't<br>know I don't know you hope so I hope so<br>yeah you would hope that you know would<br>sort of sink<br>in question I just wondering why you use<br>univers<br>for great question actually the original<br>plan for the for the so focus groups<br>were done at bort with the adults yeah<br>but the drawing for the children the<br>workshops were done here because we had<br>originally planned that they were going<br>to be done at the art gallery with the<br>art gallery um they've got a really<br>great Education team uh so they were<br>going to sort of help us with that but<br>then the art gallery closed for<br>renovations um and they they do have<br>they did have another space there but it<br>campus it does make the place of<br>interviews or research activity does<br>make a difference um so we tried to make<br>our space as um child friendly and as as<br>open and uh exciting as possible we had<br>lots of different art materials to work<br>with and uh Refreshments so hopefully<br>hopefully we created the right<br>atmosphere yeah does make it I think<br>question focus group<br>intervie um a lot of a lot of like wow<br>here yeah another fun thing we had at<br>those interviews with the adults was<br>these um there's big B's got some big<br>scrapbooks of<br>cuttings from the whole 40 years of<br>existence um and so we had access to<br>those um so people could look through<br>those oh I remember that and I that was<br>when we were in such and such a show so<br>fun yes Dale it's not a question comment<br>1988<br>of was we need to involve the schools to<br>yeah and Bob was one of those people who<br>came up often in the in in the<br>interviews<br>yeah your finding show not surprisingly<br>people who engag with B found that it<br>has<br>last what do you think about people who<br>don't necessarily engage with the ACT<br>what do you think their perception would<br>be<br>question<br>well oh yeah I guess you value you value<br>those places that you use the most you<br>know so if you if you're a surfer you<br>would value the beach the most you know<br>so yeah I think we and that's the beauty<br>of a community we all have different um<br>interests and values and yeah the DI<br>diversity I think that's the point it's<br>a great it's a great question because it<br>it is about having a diverse array of<br>activities within a community so that<br>you can meet the needs of of all of us<br>and we're all very different and and we<br>link to other people through different<br>spaces so yeah that's another research<br>project a lot transer<br>skills<br>performance absolutely<br>yeser saying confidence being courageous<br>yeah all those things that those are all<br>attributes I think we might have any<br>final questions or comments oh good<br>great so original B cour was for AC<br>right if you're going to a bigger event<br>it's a lot more expensive the same<br>material what sort of seating are you<br>looking for when 500's probably<br>beautiful children's<br>performances yeah actually Bay Court has<br>got the most amazing views like nowhere<br>in Bay Court can you have a bad view a<br>bad seat there are no bad seats um so<br>that is one of the beauties of bayt but<br>yes for Children's shows yeah that's<br>yeah so so<br>what are you looking for oh I I don't<br>have any new for yeah well it's just<br>that um there there are shows that can't<br>come to Bay Court because the stage is<br>too small or that the um the the<br>auditorium is too small to make it<br>economical so um you know where touring<br>production could come to a bigger<br>theater and just do one night and<br>therefore only pay their performance and<br>stuff for one night and have a you know<br>earn a lot more from them big the the<br>the big Auditorium um they don't<br>necessarily come to Bay Court but um in<br>the stage wise for example the ballet<br>don't come for their full shows because<br>the stage is too small<br>um but they do brings occasionally not<br>very often um to tut on to yeah so it's<br>just it's just what what what can come<br>doesn't that actually help children in<br>the bay having a smaller venue oh yeah<br>absolutely I mean and and and and that<br>venue is perfect for school shows and<br>things like that it's just it's it's not<br>really related to children that we would<br>a bigger venue might be nice for to era<br>it's more for for everybody yeah not not<br>Shanta I just remember<br>like one of the participants I think was<br>a teacher and she mentioned that um<br>because I think she did a performance<br>that had lots lots and lots of kids<br>froms and there was um not enough seats<br>yes<br>yeah we should be yeah we should be<br>asking Reena to answer these<br>questions the experts right<br>here okay well we we are delighted that<br>you've come to our presentation thank<br>you so much everyone for coming out<br>tonight hopefully the presentation has<br>given you lots to think about and<br>maybe kindled your own memories of bay<br>cortt that you may have had uh uh use<br>that space when you were younger or have<br>children that use it now so thank you so<br>much um uh go carefully out there on<br>this on this uh dark night uh and we uh<br>once again thank you for attending the<br>public lecture there will be more public<br>lectures coming up and we'll notify you<br>through the usual means of our email<br>list</p></main><footer
