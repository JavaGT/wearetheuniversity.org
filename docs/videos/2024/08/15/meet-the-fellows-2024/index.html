the uh projects<br>that they will undertake or have<br>undertaken during their residencies so<br>please join me in welcoming Dr Simon<br>Eastwood Marcel gisha Michaela nyman and<br>fiana to aoy let's give them a round of<br>applause firstly just congratulations to<br>all of you um you know uh receiving this<br>Fellowship um you know is obviously a um<br>a great marker of your achievements uh<br>today and so we we congratulate you and<br>are so happy to have you in our<br>community can I start with a bit of an<br>nice I'm going to stop talking now I've<br>talked for about 15 minutes um I want to<br>I want to throw it over to you and let's<br>hear from you um uh with a bit of an<br>icebreaker uh where you can talk a<br>little bit about yourselves specifically<br>what has been the path to get you to<br>this point in your career and if each of<br>you could pick up a microphone and<br>great it takes a moment right hello I'm<br>Marcela um the dance fellow the dance<br>fellow in Community Dance um the path to<br>this<br>place um I'm a choreographer and a<br>dancer as you heard and um I've been<br>also um um I've opened a dance space in<br>Berlin and as you can imagine um in most<br>places in the world there's not a lot of<br>money to support things from scratch<br>right when you begin so the moment that<br>we opened the space we had to do most of<br>the work on our own so I was doing a lot<br>of construction work and other kinds of<br>jobs in order to facilitate and to<br>create a dance floor and then after that<br>facilitate dance workshops and dance<br>classes and further on then with funding<br>also festivals and other formats and<br>forums and things like this all the time<br>also doing my own practice and teaching<br>around and um what has been the kind of<br>through line is that um I've learned how<br>it's not just the movement what's<br>important but how you frame the movement<br>and how we um allow other people to see<br>what that movement is through what lens<br>we put it so all the formats I've tried<br>to develop in in the lake Studios um are<br>very much about changing the way that we<br>see dance and how dance um can be part<br>of everybody's life um and it's not an<br>elite thing um to make and so it's for<br>me it's very important to make it as<br>accessible as possible to as many people<br>as POS possible and so um getting this<br>Fellowship in Community Dance has<br>actually been a really big support and a<br>big turning point also for me in my own<br>work because I've been able to um give<br>classes and work with so many diverse<br>kinds of people and and I've just<br>through asking them different questions<br>about where they find joy and interest<br>in movement in their life it also has<br>changed a lot how I structure my dance<br>classes because I try to make everything<br>that I do very relatable to move like<br>very um known movements to you like<br>things like pushing or pulling like<br>everyone understands that and also what<br>is walking what is traveling and so that<br>is always the base um I've kind of maybe<br>said too many things already but um the<br>fact that it is a fellowship in<br>Community Dance has been very meaningful<br>because it's really help me to broaden<br>the term of what Dance is for my own<br>work as well so it's been this Exchange<br>very big exchange process and I feel<br>very supported um to have this time away<br>also from my space um to be able to<br>connect um to as all these different<br>people and you are also included in that<br>so I'm very excited about meeting you<br>Simon um tell us about your<br>pathway k um I've always had a fairly<br>eclectic um approach to music making um<br>you know in high school I was um I<br>played various instruments and played<br>various Styles like from rock bands to<br>Jazz and classical things and so that<br>sort of continued on when I went to<br>University and studied composition<br>um at some point I was very fortunate to<br>um be able to go to London to study at<br>the Royal Academy of Music and they um<br>really pushed Us by throwing all kinds<br>of different um projects at us very<br>quickly and a lot of those projects were<br>collaborative projects um which was<br>something I thoroughly enjoyed um<br>because I really appreciated the way<br>that another person can um push you in<br>New Directions and to um help you to<br>discover things that you wouldn't on<br>your own through a creative process um<br>so when I came back that sort of became<br>my my main focus for a few years which<br>was to um do these sort of longdistance<br>collaborations with people that had met<br>all around the world and it was<br>incredibly rewarding<br>process um<br>to yeah to just basically explore those<br>different ways and just<br>to the use the community in a sense um<br>the way that we're connected to one<br>another you know creatives we often<br>um need to remember that we are<br>connected to each other in a very<br>intimate ways and I think that was a<br>very important way to explore that um so<br>yeah and since then I um like myella um<br>you know we had to do a lot of different<br>things for a while so I had about you<br>know sort five different jobs teaching<br>various things from swimming to um<br>orchestration and conducting and um a<br>little bit of uni teaching but um yeah<br>so well something I like to call the<br>freelance juggle so you're always kind<br>of doing lots of different things which<br>is incredibly exciting and varied but um<br>sometimes um leaves you wanting more<br>time to work on your own thing and which<br>is which brings me here which has um<br>been a fantastic experience to have time<br>you know um it's one of the greatest<br>artist um I'm not like everybody else<br>when my degree is in education history<br>and maths it's not overly useful for<br>writing um I started writing because<br>when our four kids were scholar um I<br>couldn't find books by or about Tong and<br>authors and um I don't know if you've<br>come across Dr Rudin some's Bishop she's<br>an American researcher she says that<br>books can be mirrors that reflect your<br>lives back to you or windows that let<br>you see into other realities or sliding<br>glass doors that you can use to enter<br>other worlds well for our kids books<br>would just never mirrors so I basically<br>started writing so that they'd be able<br>to see themselves in books and even now<br>the main thing I do is that I write<br>about things that make sense to us as a<br>family so um I'm I've heard people say<br>sometimes that I'm writing tongue and<br>things or I'm writing for Pacific people<br>none of that's true I'm just writing our<br>experience so that my kids and kids like<br>them um can see themselves in books and<br>I have this kind of master plan that<br>should any of our kids ever produce a<br>grandchild instead of a grand dog um<br>they'll be able to read Tong and writers<br>so and I think you can't do that if you<br>if you never see yourself in a book and<br>you don't think that books are for you<br>so that's why I started<br>K and Michaela k um yes my name is<br>Michaela nman and I come from some small<br>Islands between Finland and Sweden which<br>is actually the largest archipelago in<br>the Northern Hemisphere and um we were<br>granted um<br>uh Independence or not Independence<br>autonomy by um the League of Nations<br>about a 100 years ago and it was a huge<br>celebration in my Island so we are very<br>proud of our culture and Heritage and<br>being part of Finland but we have our<br>own language which is Swedish and if you<br>come from a small island nation you have<br>to leave to go somewhere else because we<br>don't have universities you have to find<br>education maybe a job maybe even a<br>partner that you didn't go to school in<br>kind<br>with and so I ended up here because I<br>met a man from<br>taranaki but um writing has always been<br>really important and storytelling for me<br>my grandfather was um a very um unusual<br>man who ended up in um as a priest<br>because he couldn't U go into theater<br>his very um<br>Lutheran um parents didn't allow him and<br>he thought the closest he could get to<br>having some theater and drama and bling<br>and uh some lovely you know coats and<br>whatnot was to go into priesthood and he<br>was very uh controversial so he was<br>exiled as far as away as the church<br>could get him and that was to the Orland<br>Island where he kind of started putting<br>flowers on the altar um writing poetry<br>writing his uh community history and<br>stuff and my grandfather and I were very<br>close so we always um had an exchange in<br>letters and later I became a<br>journalist but this storytelling and the<br>need to get your stories out has always<br>been with me and this is why I also work<br>with people in the Pacific in banatu<br>specifically and we have just had this<br>amazing short short story on event the<br>microfiction storytelling and I also<br>believe that storytelling and writing<br>your stories is for everyone it's not an<br>elitist thing and English is my fourth<br>language so I'm very grateful to be here<br>and to be a published WR writer I'm a<br>novelist and I write non-fiction and<br>poetry in English and<br>Swedish and but if you are from a small<br>island nation who will read you if they<br>don't understand your language and if<br>you are from a place where maybe the<br>majority language takes over and the<br>minority languages are not meant to be<br>supported the same way or they don't get<br>their support then maybe translation is<br>your way to get out maybe you need to<br>embrace a word language like French or<br>Spanish or English to actually get a<br>readership beyond your small borders so<br>yeah I work in collaboration across<br>borders across art disciplines I think<br>it's really important and this is a<br>wonderful wonderful nurturing<br>environment to be in danen is truly a<br>gift like Simon said the gift of time<br>the gift of community and the gift to<br>just explore and do your stuff instead<br>of having 100 contracts on the go and<br>creative New Zealand applications and<br>yeah thank you<br>you could I um could I ask you all um<br>firstly thank you for that we're um<br>aren't we lucky four of the most<br>interesting people um each of you have<br>talked a little bit about your creative<br>uh processes but I I'd like to invite<br>you really just to um to unpack a little<br>bit um for for us you know what is your<br>creative um what does your creative<br>can start the other end of the table<br>okay mine involves a lot of walking I<br>love to be outside and uh I do a lot of<br>walking and I think when I walk the<br>problem is that I actually should write<br>down things as I walk and I don't always<br>have time and so I forget by the time I<br>get to the other end and the next day<br>when I pass the same place go through<br>the same tree little green belt I think<br>got the same thing and it's very<br>annoying um so I've started writing down<br>I have three notebooks on the go and<br>they are for different projects and<br>that's part of my process to try to<br>write down things even if it's fragments<br>like my current um second poetry<br>collection which was published in<br>Finland in<br>Swedish um that is a series of fragments<br>basically it was built up over time but<br>collecting those fragments weaving them<br>together um then maybe introducing<br>something else you know that's how<br>yeah sorry I couldn't make the green<br>light go<br>um I write for adults and kids and I<br>write fiction and non-fiction and I<br>write for the educational market and for<br>the trade market the sorts of things<br>that are in bookshops and that and for<br>everything I write it's exactly the same<br>um I usually I'll start with some sort<br>of a vague idea often a what if question<br>where I really like things where you<br>have two unlikely things put together so<br>for example my latest book Len the<br>legion started um with the question what<br>if a perfectionist tried to succeed at<br>failing so that was my question and then<br>I just start writing I don't plan in<br>advance because I don't want to be<br>writing from here I want to be writing<br>you know for my sales kind of thing and<br>so the first words of the first draft of<br>that book were literally something about<br>someone who so I wrote that and I just<br>started and at that point I thought the<br>main character might have been a girl<br>turned out he was a boy um I didn't know<br>his name was L peny I definitely didn't<br>know he was a legend that's all stuff I<br>found out while I was writing and I will<br>just keep going till the end when I get<br>to the end I go back and write the<br>beginning and then um I edit it and<br>craft it until it's how I want it to be<br>and I do that with everything even with<br>non-fiction that's just how I do things<br>um there's there will have been a lot of<br>thinking but it's not sort of conscious<br>thinking in advance um yeah my my<br>thinking process involves writing so if<br>I was at something like this sitting at<br>your end I'd be writing things down if<br>I'm looking very attentive you know I'm<br>daydreaming so yeah so I just do the<br>same thing for everything I do and yeah<br>so far so good good the only thing that<br>was different actually for this you had<br>to put in a proposal and that's back to<br>front to how I work so that was really<br>weird because I had to say in advance<br>what I was going to write but I didn't<br>so k um my I kind of have two creative<br>processes<br>um one involves um improvisation and<br>being very in the moment um<br>and that's very fast um you know I can<br>sort of create something and basically<br>as long as the whatever it is I've<br>created is um the the issue with that<br>sometimes arises that the way that<br>people improvise is that they're using<br>um like a repertoire so you have a whole<br>bunch of tricks that you sort of bring<br>out and um a lot of the time you want to<br>introduce new tricks um which brings me<br>to the second creative process which is<br>very very slow and methodical and<br>sometimes um a little bit mathematical<br>um where I will um sort of develop a<br>concept over time<br>um and um just sort of move one little<br>bit at you know it's a bit like nissing<br>or something you just kind of like one<br>stitch at a time and eventually you come<br>up with something and and the whole<br>reveals itself um but really um and<br>occasionally there might be a mix<br>between those two um it really depends<br>on the project um who you're working<br>working with um what the kind of the<br>concept is that either you start with or<br>you arises out of the process um so<br>really it kind of varies but it's sort<br>of usually um oscillates between those<br>extremes always nice it's always nice to<br>hear what other people say before you<br>speak because it always adds something<br>and it reminds me that I actually also<br>have two creative processes um the one<br>where I have to be in the moment and<br>respond to everything around so to be<br>really present here and now um when<br>improvising but also when teaching a<br>class for example and the other one<br>being just my other creative process<br>begins by paying attention and just<br>watching things around me um movement um<br>life emerging and just seeing Beautiful<br>Moments that I would then somehow like<br>to share so the next step in that<br>process would be to set up structures to<br>allow similar types of occurrences to<br>happen again and maybe not knowing<br>exactly Which movement is going to be<br>but to set up the structure in such a<br>way that the people involved to create<br>that performance moment will go through<br>similar processes where we can watch<br>people working um rather than trying to<br>express something but people trying to<br>figure something out through movement<br>and I find that is very interesting as<br>um when you're watching someone uh<br>figure out a physical problem you really<br>get an eye into who they are um instead<br>of the person saying who they are you<br>see them actually engaged and working so<br>the second of the process is creating<br>these structures and the structure as<br>I've come here is that I've TR had to<br>also create a structure within the<br>community so I've set up Community dance<br>classes which are open for anyone to<br>join Wednesdays and Fridays from 9:30 to<br>11: um to get to know people but also to<br>engage in the practice and through these<br>Community classes um I'm like creating<br>wider and wider networks um it started<br>very small with Anna who's sitting here<br>in the audience the she's putting<br>together the dance otop poti newsletter<br>and I'm very grateful to you actually<br>for that but she started a little<br>Network and it grows and grows and grows<br>and then through that um I'm reaching<br>out through to a lot of different kind<br>of people to participate in a final<br>performance with 24 very diverse<br>participants where we're going to see<br>each of them um figuring out a little<br>something through a movement<br>solo um I guess I could keep talking<br>about it but um yeah I think I think<br>it's maybe enough my next question<br>really to all of you and and you<br>probably started to answer this um but a<br>number of you have mentioned other<br>participants in your<br>practice um<br>so so what is the role of of others you<br>know be they<br>collaborators um uh artists um or<br>creatives you know from other um you<br>know genres uh readers<br>audience um you know people<br>commissioning your work what is you know<br>what is the what is the what is the<br>interface between you and others you<br>Simon sure<br>um yeah well that's something I spent<br>quite a lot of time thinking about and<br>um the main word which sort of came up<br>was the idea of a<br>provocation um and a provocation is<br>something that um pushes you into a<br>different train of thought than you<br>would be if you were on your own path<br>and so other people for that are very um<br>important way of keeping me out of my<br>sort of my little Loops my little<br>circles that I can get stuck in um so<br>that could be that could come in a<br>number of different ways it could be<br>someone that's actually working on the<br>project with you um it could be someone<br>that's giv you feedback it could be a<br>commissioner so a commissioner would um<br>kind of set the boundaries of your work<br>um sometimes if you can do<br>anything um the question becomes what do<br>you do so having that box is in itself a<br>sort of a provoc provocation that you<br>inevitably find yourself kind of pushing<br>up against and in various ways<br>um yeah so that's that's how<br>want um writing is a thing I do in a<br>room on my own but it's always a<br>collaboration um even just with coming<br>up with the initial idea you have ideas<br>you're kind of already standing on the<br>shoulders of other people because you<br>have ideas because of the world you live<br>in the people you interact with the<br>things you've read the things that<br>people have said before you were even<br>born nature anything it's always a<br>collaboration you never being a genius<br>on your own it's just not a thing so the<br>idea is<br>collaborative then um and also sometimes<br>I'm commissioned to write things and so<br>that's the same as what Simon was saying<br>you know sometimes you get pages and<br>pages of things that you have to<br>consider when you're writing when you're<br>writing for educational things you have<br>to consider supporting the child to<br>decode as well as everything else once<br>you've written it it goes into the<br>editor and there's a lot of backwards<br>and forwards um with things being<br>changed and you know tweaked a bit to<br>sort of fit whatever they think their um<br>you know buying public is going to want<br>um and then also when you write for<br>children often there's an illustrator<br>involved and that person is adding their<br>own level of story to your story so<br>that's another collaboration and then of<br>course when um you've gone through all<br>of that and it goes out to the public<br>there's the collaboration with the<br>reader the story think that I think I'm<br>telling isn't necessarily the same as<br>the one you think you reading so yeah<br>the whole thing is collaborative I don't<br>think any of it stands<br>alone no and to add to that I think it's<br>um there's several aspects to it but um<br>being somewhere um like in taranaki<br>where you don't have a huge um critical<br>mass of writers or working with emerging<br>writers and then emerging literary scene<br>in Vanuatu are three totally different<br>things so what it does for a writer is<br>it extends you it challenges you you<br>take risks that you might not take<br>normally you work with someone who is in<br>the visual arts or in music and you are<br>seeing things differently and then you<br>see how it comes together which by the<br>way there's a national poetry Day event<br>Happening Here in danin which is going<br>to include a lot of different kind of<br>collaboration and those things are very<br>joyful and that is what we also need<br>because we do sit and labor away Beaver<br>away in our own kind of secluded box but<br>if you work on a on an essay you're<br>going to do something very different<br>research-wise and revising Ed editing<br>wise than if you work on your very first<br>uh raw draft manuscript for a creative<br>work like a novel or if you are in an<br>editing phase with someone who is an<br>editor on the other side of the world<br>talking about every single comma in your<br>poetry collection there there are such<br>different uh kind of um skill sets and<br>mindsets that you need for the creative<br>part and the just plunging ahead versus<br>the editing part and to then get the joy<br>that comes with having community meeting<br>face to face having that interaction and<br>feeling the energy in the room is just<br>amazing and that's what we also need to<br>cups yeah when I'm teaching different<br>kinds of people like yesterday I was<br>teaching some six to 11 year olds at a<br>at a primary school um you always have<br>to have a specific language to connect<br>to each of the different backgrounds and<br>perspectives of the people you're trying<br>to reach so also expands my<br>understanding of what dance is because<br>it I'm it somehow gets more and more<br>simplified the more varied the um<br>backgrounds and perspectives are so um<br>for example for the kids yesterday um we<br>I was trying to inspire them about what<br>all could be a dance and so I was saying<br>like this little movement in your hand<br>can be a dance and then you can put it<br>in your pocket and can you do you can do<br>your own dance waiting for the bus<br>station and um what I love about dance<br>is that it changes is your perspective<br>on the world so you can look at look at<br>the world sideways or this way or upside<br>down and as I was talking to them they<br>were doing it with me um and in all my<br>classes at the beginning um I often ask<br>the participants what is your like what<br>interests you about movement in your<br>life so it's not like a dance technique<br>but it might be something like walking<br>or swimming or um even Pottery or<br>anything where you have movement that<br>you can reference from and then the<br>class ends up actually also referencing<br>those things so each class will be then<br>somehow also halfway improvised because<br>I'm trying to draw on the things that<br>people have given me in order to expand<br>the practice for the whole room and I<br>had a sports player in in the class once<br>and I knew that he wasn't like<br>comfortable to be in the setting of the<br>dance class so I tried to very<br>consciously like create the atmosphere<br>of being in a game and watching where<br>each other is and keeping track of where<br>people are in space so to to kind of<br>also evoke this sense of connectedness<br>like oh this I understand this because<br>I've been playing in a field and I know<br>how it is to have to keep track of where<br>everyone is at the same time and it's<br>not just for that one person it actually<br>becomes then for the entire group that<br>um that that becomes like an added<br>information that kind of solidifies your<br>experience in the space and makes<br>everyone feel like like a web or a<br>network within that class<br>say<br>um by way of kind of uh intermission uh<br>or just to take a little break um I've<br>just realized that we have two fellows<br>who we haven't heard from yet uh because<br>they have a little uh video to play um<br>so uh can I um can I just uh introduce<br>once again the um the Francis Hodgkins<br>fellows Miranda Bellamy and Amanda<br>ferter uh and um if we could just play<br>um their peace uh they have they have<br>also responded to some of these<br>questions and um and uh in their little<br>introductory uh um piece uh speak about<br>some of these things so I think it's<br>it's a it's appropriate that we just<br>hear from them so if you could push play<br>and we've got a few moments just to made<br>Miranda I'm Miranda bam and this is<br>Amanda F thank you all for being here uh<br>we've been really looking forward to<br>this event and of course we wish we<br>could be there with you in person um but<br>we're briefly in Canada to present two<br>solo exhibitions so we're recording this<br>today from the traditional territory of<br>MMI known as Sackville New Brunswick on<br>the East Coast since it's Genesis in<br>2019 our collaborative research-based<br>interdisciplinary practice has been<br>underpinned by this idea of listening to<br>plants uh the stories that have revealed<br>themselves subsequently have been<br>fascinating challenging and stimulating<br>and they've resulted in a busy few years<br>of developing and presenting exhibitions<br>so going back to 2021 we presented an<br>exhibition titled radiata at tatio<br>karangi the blue oyster art project<br>space in otoi and this was our first<br>foray into building relationship ship<br>with industry both as a research tool<br>and as a means to realize an<br>exhibition on the heels of this<br>exhibition we presented aan case where<br>we really dug deep into site specific<br>research in the context of Kawa Island<br>and the Hari golf a location that has a<br>very multifaceted Botanical history the<br>resulting four Channel synchronized<br>video Work included a soundscape that<br>was composed in part by the plant's<br>electrical activity this work has been<br>exhibited several times times in various<br>settings and formats since including as<br>part of terrarium a solo Exhibition at<br>the Owens Art Gallery in New Brunswick<br>in Canada in<br>2022 where we showcased this piece<br>alongside another existing video work<br>and a series of new Sandstone sculptures<br>whose lines are traced through a similar<br>generative process of measuring<br>individual plants electrical<br>activity in this case the plants that<br>are growing on the site of the historic<br>Sandstone Quarry where the rocks<br>originated the same year we showed slooh<br>slow slooh as part of the Project's<br>initiative at the AL art fear curated by<br>Michael do and commissioned by the chw<br>trust this Project's Point of Departure<br>was Queen's Wolf the venue for the fear<br>and a site where the stories of the kaha<br>tree the production of butter and<br>histories of refrigerated shipping are<br>entangled in 2023 we continued our<br>collaborative engagement with industry<br>to realize Stone moov at tea in tahuna<br>Queenstown four tons of shist were<br>borrowed from a quarry a short distance<br>from the gallery and assembled into<br>sonically activated sculptures that<br>referenced the complex histories and<br>geological processes across deep time<br>time later in 2023 we presented<br>Collective at the art gallery of Grand<br>Prairie in Alberta Canada Collective has<br>been a process of accumulation resulting<br>in a series of portrait style<br>photographs of trees these particular<br>trees are from seemingly disparate<br>locations from the ARG peninsula in<br>Scotland to tuap in Western Southland<br>but all share something in common which<br>is that they've been marked in some way<br>the photographs are framed in the wood<br>species that corresponds to the tree in<br>the portrait for example a photograph of<br>a maple tree is in a maple frame and in<br>this way we attempt to close the<br>distance between wood and tree The Works<br>are hung in in a hall of ancestor style<br>and this is one of the exhibitions that<br>we are currently presenting in Canada<br>this time at the Mount St Vincent<br>University Art Gallery in juk took Hal<br>Scotia the very first day of our 20124<br>Francis Hodgkins Fellowship year was<br>marked by opening signal Echo at the<br>audio foundation in tomaki Makoto<br>Auckland this 8 channel audio video and<br>sculpture exhibition Drew lines through<br>seed pods floorboards and fog horns<br>tracing layered stories of vegetal<br>displacement and material consequence<br>for this piece we collaborated with Otti<br>based wood turner David large and<br>musician Chris Miller to replicate the<br>sounds of sight specific fog horns from<br>across<br>oceans what came next once we returned<br>to otot to settle into our fellowship<br>Studio has been a wonderful and<br>necessary process of clearing our desk<br>proverbially and literally meing our<br>practice with all the things it needs to<br>grow and develop in a healthy and<br>sustained way being supported by otako<br>faka uaka the University of Oto in all<br>the ways that we have been has been an<br>impeccable timing after a fully<br>committed few years the space the<br>fellowship has created to do more<br>reading and research experiment without<br>pressure and connect and engage with our<br>wonderful Community has been<br>invaluable we've been going back to the<br>roots of our practice so to to speak<br>looking again at the language and<br>framing of the plants we call weeds and<br>unpacking this as we develop new<br>projects another way that we're enjoying<br>and utilizing this time space and<br>freedom is by challenging ourselves to<br>learn new tools Technologies and<br>softwares developing skills that will<br>continue to serve us long after the<br>fellowship year for example we<br>experimented with recontextualizing our<br>2021 work award and case into an<br>augmented reality world that's<br>experienced by our audience through a VR<br>headset we had the opportunity to share<br>this piece as part of the group<br>exhibition the chronicle of a new love<br>order on the invitation of curatorial<br>collective the chronicle of this<br>exhibition was alongside the aloa<br>Digital Arts Symposium in tangara<br>Wellington which was a really valuable<br>invitation to consider the many ways<br>that AI interacts with us as<br>artists and we've also been teaching<br>animation we've been thinking about the<br>many ways that Botanical knowledge is<br>built and shared through our engagement<br>with the botany Department we were<br>introduced to their collection of<br>brindle Botanical models these are<br>teaching tools that were made in Berlin<br>by the brindle company in the late 1800s<br>and early<br>1900s these models are our current<br>research focus and the source material<br>for our new solo exhibition Rican<br>which will be exhibited at YYZ artists<br>Outlet a project space in Toronto in a<br>few few weeks time for this work we're<br>collaborating with poet musician and<br>artist Colleen Coco Collins who lives<br>here in mcari coko has been writing<br>poems in response to each plant model<br>and the plant that it represents tracing<br>long threads of interconnected<br>stories last month the hard cover<br>catalog for terrarium was published by<br>the Owens art gallery and this is our<br>first hard cover publication it contains<br>incredibly thoughtful texts by Emily<br>faly and Bruce E Phillips uh we're<br>excited to share that uh we now have the<br>opportunity thanks to some support from<br>the New Brunswick Arts board to<br>self-publish an artist book for our<br>project Collective with texts by Emily<br>Jan and Jessica groom we're hoping to<br>bring a suitcase back full of both of<br>these Publications to share with you all<br>when we return next<br>month we look forward to returning to<br>our studio soon and when we do we'll be<br>expanding the 3D scanning animation work<br>that has informed radicant and continue<br>on with a local industry collaboration<br>that we're really excited about and just<br>generally getting our hands dirty making<br>new works towards our fellowship outcome<br>exhibition<br>atak the Haw Gallery save the date for<br>February 14th 2025 we would love to see<br>you all there and please feel free to<br>reach out to us if you've got any<br>questions about us or our work uh our<br>contact details should be pretty readily<br>available to find online thank you to<br>otaka faki wer the University of Oto and<br>the Jen public art gallery for hosting<br>us here this morning come and<br>fellows so uh thank you to uh to Amanda<br>and Miranda for putting uh that little<br>presentation together amidst uh you know<br>a busy time for them over in Canada um<br>so if we could just jump back into our<br>conversation um uh the last uh the last<br>little uh bit of dialogue that we were<br>having was about the input of others uh<br>in in your practice and I'm interested<br>um to kind of extend that uh a little<br>bit um and talk about place um you know<br>creative residency programs establish uh<br>the opportunity uh for a two-way<br>relationship between creative<br>practitioner and a new<br>environment uh so my question is how do<br>you think uh being in<br>UTI uh has uh affected um your outputs<br>you know of late um and I guess uh how<br>do you think they might um um you know<br>future um being back in a university<br>environment which is where I grew up<br>because my father was a professor um of<br>ceramic engineering the science side at<br>Alfred University in the states um being<br>back in University environment has been<br>really um feeling like kind of a home<br>and also just because of the<br>interdisciplinary nature of having all<br>different kinds of people in invested in<br>different fields of study and knowledge<br>and it's also just reminded me so much<br>of how dance holds all these kind of<br>other disciplines within them or it can<br>connect to all other kinds of<br>disciplines um for me dance of course<br>makes me feel good and I release energy<br>and makes me happy to move and other<br>people in my classes have similar<br>experiences that they feel good<br>afterwards but for me it goes um Beyond<br>just the the movement part um I also<br>want to inspire people to see Elements<br>of Dance AS science and also Elements of<br>Dance as art and to really find access<br>to that to to be able to perceive that<br>in in what how they move and also how<br>movement um creates new neural<br>Connections in your mind and the way of<br>perceiving reality because when we<br>change how we perceive reality we also<br>act different and that creates then<br>physical changes that just reverberate<br>out and um specifically being in um in<br>otot dunan has been very inspiring<br>because I was really obsessed and I<br>still am very obsessed with octopus and<br>I've been listening on repeat to this<br>beautiful book about octopus called um<br>other<br>Minds um by Peter Godfrey Smith from<br>Australia and um I've just had the<br>chance for example to go to the Marine<br>Science Department and teach the whole<br>um staff there um a movement Workshop<br>about pushing and pulling and realizing<br>how the whole body starts to be more<br>decentralized not like only thinking of<br>what movement you want to do ahead of<br>time in your head but just like allowing<br>all different parts of your body to make<br>decisions um and this very much relates<br>to octopus because that's how that's how<br>their nervous system is rearranged there<br>it's a very decentralized animal and I<br>think that um by doing different kind of<br>movement practices um engaging in that<br>we're also able to um change the way<br>that we interact with with people around<br>us and and um I think that there's just<br>a lot of unexplored potential that<br>working with the body connection to mind<br>um still has to offer and it it's often<br>forgotten um this other kind of<br>knowledge of embodied knowledge and so<br>that's one of the things that I want to<br>try to connect more and more while I'm<br>here in the more University environment<br>is that is is not just about dances<br>being something beautiful and fun to do<br>but also that it has a lot to offer to<br>all other fields of study so that's<br>where my inspiration comes from being<br>actually in the University environment<br>yeah and if anyone else likes octopus<br>though yeah um I for for me um is is<br>very steep in memory actually um so I<br>lived here until I was till my bit after<br>my fifth birthday and um and now my my<br>parents uh live here after having been<br>away for a very long time and<br>um so for me the there's a very much a<br>sense of looking backwards and um<br>recovering things because since I lived<br>here I'm sorry to say I didn't I didn't<br>really make it back very much um so it's<br>it's really a case of rediscovering the<br>place um everything that's here and it<br>it sort of encourages you to really<br>um you sort of sink down you go deep<br>deeper and deeper and deeper and then<br>sometimes you know when you could move<br>sideways you just sort of yeah go<br>further into memory so in terms of um my<br>work um I'm I'm a little slow so<br>sometimes<br>uh you know things don't influence my<br>work until later so<br>um um I know it's definitely going to<br>influence my work probably next year but<br>definitely in terms of um what I'm<br>working on it's often a memory that I'm<br>working with rather than what's<br>happening at that present moment because<br>I think I you I need to process things<br>it takes a while um but yeah I<br>definitely um it's having a huge<br>influence being here and will continue<br>future um I grew up just up the road in<br>tamuka and my mom's one of 14 and my<br>dad's 1 or seven so I've got aunties and<br>uncles and cousins for Africa um I spent<br>a lot of my childhood visiting here but<br>this is the first time that I've ever<br>lived here even though it's<br>temporary<br>um I've always felt sort of vaguely<br>displaced up north<br>even though I've spent most of my life<br>there um it's not that people are so<br>different but down here I sort of feel<br>like I'm with people who sort of see the<br>world or approach the world is probably<br>a better way to say that actually<br>approach the world in a way that's more<br>similar to how I was brought up to<br>approach it you know having genuine<br>conversations with random strangers on<br>the street and all that sort of thing um<br>I made a conscious decision that the<br>place was going to um affect this<br>particular piece of work that I was<br>doing down here so I set my novel in<br>denen and one of my main characters has<br>just moved down just like I did and so<br>through that I get to say a lot of<br>things from the point of view of someone<br>who's not embedded here but you know is<br>having an experience of living here and<br>um this particular character is only<br>living here temporarily as well so it's<br>really affected it in that way<br>but the other thing that's really<br>affected it is um the cross pooll um<br>cross-pollination that you get down here<br>I found that all of um the different<br>people I've met in different situations<br>are so interconnected in a way that's<br>not true or not as true in Hamilton we<br>have quite a strong sort of literary<br>scene but um it's a little bit more<br>siloed and I just love the way that when<br>you go to something that's a little bit<br>left Filled from what you're doing<br>yourself you know it impacts the way you<br>see things so it's given me new ways of<br>thinking new ways of um approaching<br>things just by virtue of being in a new<br>place I always find it a really creative<br>thing to do to just go to a new place<br>and just wander around rather than doing<br>all the um you know the big tourist<br>things I've done those as well but the<br>main thing has just been wandering<br>around and being part of the<br>city well I'm not at all as disciplined<br>as as you guys I've just uh embraced<br>every opportunity I have to get out and<br>about and um I have to say there's a<br>wonderful poetry scene here and we don't<br>have that kind of a strong literary<br>scene in taranaki we have the strong<br>music scene and the visual arts but I've<br>so enjoyed the shout out to octagon<br>poetry Collective National flash fiction<br>events all of these things also going a<br>bit wider having excursions to Queen<br>Town um do writing workshops here and<br>there and um yeah I think it's um very<br>valuable and I'm also getting asked to<br>do lectures and presentations with<br>different academic circles so those in<br>the peace and research institution those<br>in the Pacific talanoa Network U but<br>also the English Department and of<br>course you go into the library and you<br>take out one book well you know a<br>library is a community in itself you go<br>there and you are supposed to go for<br>that one book and then next to that book<br>that happens to be and then you look<br>above and you know suddenly you come out<br>with a whole stack and I've discovered<br>that uh we don't get any late fees guys<br>interloan<br>interloan and so yeah I'm just enjoying<br>it and I'm also finding new ways of<br>doing things which will be very useful<br>and then we have city of literature here<br>and I see we have a wonderful honorary<br>console of Finland here who I didn't<br>know existed in danin and uh the city of<br>literature danin has a sister city in<br>Finland right on the border to Russia<br>where actually my first published short<br>story was set there and I didn't even<br>know kmo my uncle was a principal 40ks<br>from kmo for 20 years so maybe this is a<br>way of getting back to Finland via danen<br>so who knows it you know things move in<br>various circles and you just have to<br>embrace some of those opportunities I<br>think<br>yeah thank you I'm just looking at the<br>um at the clock uh behind me uh and um<br>we're starting to run out of time and uh<br>none of you have had the opportunity to<br>ask any questions so this is that<br>opportunity does anyone um does anyone<br>have any uh questions that they would<br>thank you I I would be very interested<br>to ask the two writers but it may apply<br>to Simon as well uh about any issues in<br>relation to publication of your work I<br>don't think you mention you might have<br>mentioned it forgive me if if if I<br>missed it but I mean if you're a writer<br>or a composer I guess you've got to<br>publish how easy or how difficult has it<br>been for the three of you and<br>maybe dancers published too but um it<br>seems obvious to ask the writers and<br>musicians first well if I should start I<br>think it's becoming trickier and<br>trickier so um in the past two years<br>I've had super enthusiastic editors who<br>have said yes we need to publish this<br>only for it to fall over again and I<br>think this is the reality for very many<br>writers but um the day I arrived here in<br>danen on 5th of February I got a huge<br>literary award in Finland and then I got<br>interest in translating my work into<br>English and so you know you are taken<br>off on a tangent to do things that you<br>didn't plan to do but maybe in the hope<br>that it will lead somewhere but I think<br>we all work with having several works<br>out in the same you know in the same<br>space going different places and of<br>course no publisher wants to have<br>simultaneous submissions either so the<br>problem for a writer is that you are<br>very excited about your work and after a<br>while you fall out of love with it and<br>so if no one is there to take up what<br>are you going to do well usually um I<br>work as a podcaster at a radio and other<br>kind of bitsy pieces don't have enough<br>time to do my work but I don't have that<br>extra money to pay for every step of the<br>way and the publishing at the end and at<br>the end of the day the Publishers make<br>money from our books you know the normal<br>kind of division of profit is 10% to the<br>right 90% to the publisher to cover<br>their cost it's a very tiny paycheck at<br>the end of the day and now they are<br>Hybrid models but it requires you to pay<br>into it you get a bigger share or you<br>self-publish but then you end up with a<br>problem of Distributing all your work<br>you know and that's not an easy task<br>either and there's some very skillful<br>people who do all of that but you know<br>there's enough marketing and<br>communication in my life to last a<br>lifetime and actually I would have like<br>to have less yeah it's a tricky<br>question um I started writing in a much<br>more analog time so but I I still kind<br>of do the digital version of this now I<br>mean I just write what I write and then<br>unless it's been commissioned of course<br>and then you guaranteed a publication um<br>and then I look for things around that<br>are a similar sort of thing and I think<br>well that company might be interested in<br>this too and then back in the day I<br>would have just looked on the inside<br>cover and got the um address and sent it<br>in but for me once it's written I kind<br>of think I'm done I would sort of have a<br>list of five or six different places<br>that I thought might take it and my<br>theory is that one will reject it CU<br>your usual experiences that it's<br>rejected then I send it to this one and<br>if I run out of places I start again and<br>send it back to the first one again um<br>and that's worked out really well for me<br>you know I think I'm at about 262<br>published pieces now so but it's just<br>from doing that but it's not a thing<br>that's going to make me Rich because I<br>haven't worried too much about um trying<br>to be published overseas or anything a<br>lot of my stuff's gone overseas but it's<br>happened very<br>organically and I find once you've got<br>things out then people will ask you to<br>do things as well and I haven't been um<br>one of the people who's joined things<br>you're supposed to join and knows about<br>things you're supposed to know about and<br>you know goes out and makes things<br>happen I'm just a person who G to stuff<br>that's happened to me kind of thing so<br>even applying for this was outside my<br>warehouse I don't normally do that sort<br>of thing but yeah my my plan for it has<br>away yeah um much the same plug away um<br>in my case it's mostly self-published<br>and of course for music you have um<br>different forms of publishing you have<br>the publishing of the sound recording<br>um as well as the publishing of um the<br>work itself which might be in a score it<br>might not um I think musicians are quite<br>lucky in the sense that um well<br>particularly if you're in composing in a<br>medium that uses performers as opposed<br>to say Electronic media um we're very<br>lucky that we have performers in a sense<br>so we have this partner that can take a<br>piece and they can run with it you know<br>so I've had pieces that I've written for<br>people and it says it's got their name<br>on the score and everything four so and<br>so um which is a really great thing to<br>do as a composer cuz it's like you're<br>giving someone a gift it's really<br>special and then they take it around the<br>place so I've had a few pieces that<br>um I've I've written for people and<br>they've quite liked it and they've taken<br>it<br>around various countries um or I've had<br>other pieces that have just sort of been<br>picked up I had one that randomly um a<br>video of it ended up on uh like a<br>Russian Facebook feed and went sort of<br>semi viral but but I think all the<br>comments were kind of a little bit<br>snarky but that's good it's any good<br>publicity is is um you know bad<br>publicity is good publicity so that's um<br>yeah I mean it's a lot of different<br>things but for me it's mostly been<br>self-driven um yeah through um<br>researching a little bit about um<br>possible postgraduate studies I've now<br>found out that<br>performances are actually considered<br>Publications which is really great um so<br>anytime I decide to publish a dance it's<br>it's a<br>publication um so I thought it's also a<br>lot about the fact that I decide to<br>frame that moment as a dance so I have<br>these little cards right here that I've<br>made for my project which um as you can<br>see has a little hole in it and you can<br>look through it and then you can move it<br>far away or Zoom in on something or you<br>can kind of decide anything you want can<br>be a dance so I thought um since I've<br>seen that all of us have been moving a<br>little bit here and there for the last<br>um hour that we've been here um all of<br>that Movement we could consider as a<br>dance and what I thought is that we<br>could just spend exactly one minute and<br>we could publish a dance right here um<br>create our own dance performance so you<br>don't really have to do anything because<br>you act actually can't stop moving it's<br>impossible so you're kind of Trapped in<br>the fact that anything you do is a dance<br>so you might as well um have fun with it<br>and feel free about what you do um yeah<br>let's see what happens um I'm going to<br>just start this dance right now and it's<br>going to be 60 seconds um where we can<br>a absolutely ABS quite right absolutely<br>she<br>everyone so yes I have a question uh<br>what if any effect is the environment<br>and character of denan having on the<br>here well I can start by saying that I<br>didn't intend to write any poetry and I<br>probably performed more poetry than I<br>have in my<br>entire um seven years in taranaki here<br>and I'm also being asked to write things<br>and um that's very lovely so I do think<br>it will have an unexpected influence and<br>I also confess that I thought otago was<br>the land of tusuk and mountains and I<br>discovered it's Coastal as well so I<br>feel really sheepish about the fact that<br>I didn't realize quite how Coastal it is<br>and of course I'm a sea person so I uh<br>absolutely adore it so yeah I think a PO<br>is going to have a much bigger impact on<br>my work than I thought from that<br>well um it's been interesting for me<br>revisiting places that I went to a lot<br>as a kid so my n is from mcra we went<br>there Lots as kids I can remember<br>winging on the way but I had no idea D<br>it was up I don't I don't remember that<br>from being a kid um it's been yeah it's<br>just been interesting seeing things that<br>I saw as a kid through adult eyes and I<br>think the weather here is probably um<br>affecting too some of the things I've<br>written because there's just things that<br>we don't experience so much in Hamilton<br>like your wind has needles in it you<br>know that doesn't happen at home um I<br>think it's colder half the time in<br>Hamilton than it is here my husband<br>defrost the car most days and down here<br>I think we've only had three or four<br>since I've been here but it's a<br>different kind of cold and it's a sort<br>of a a very sort of open fresh sort of<br>weather and also quite gray so those two<br>things are kind of you know<br>contradictory um yeah Hamilton the cold<br>is in your bones and it's kind of damp<br>and in summer the Heats in your brain<br>you know cuz it's very muggy but we get<br>a lot more blue um so I and I've been<br>writing a bit of poetry since I've been<br>down here too and it's interesting to me<br>how much of that is seeped in but it'll<br>be um really interesting to see what<br>comes out in the next few years because<br>percolate um I think<br>definitely meeting the people has been a<br>huge part of my work here um not only<br>musicians and artists and writers and<br>dancers and things in in the area but<br>just the other fellows just meeting them<br>and just talking about art is is having<br>a huge effect um one of the really<br>striking things about Aly in particular<br>is is kind of realizing with aloa being<br>such a long country um how how different<br>just even just the light is you know<br>from from Wellington Oakland to to here<br>it's you know the sunset that's very low<br>and and it kind of changes everything<br>and then um all of these kind of old<br>buildings just make it feel like it's so<br>rooted and<br>um I don't know how that's imp impacting<br>my work yet but I'm I'm I'm it's it has<br>to you know that's how life is so<br>yeah um I think the like a little bit<br>what you said I think meeting the people<br>has been really impactful on the work um<br>New Zealand people in general but also<br>particularly also people here in dunan<br>and it just ranges from being able to<br>talk to the bus driver about my project<br>and he's just like very open so there's<br>a kind of an openness and um um not<br>assuming anything then I just feel it's<br>very easy to talk about the project and<br>what I'm trying to do with it and people<br>are like oh yeah interesting I think I<br>see what you mean rather than somehow<br>blocking it out which um tends to<br>sometimes happen in Europe because<br>people have also a very preconceived<br>idea of what things might or might not<br>be so that there's just this very<br>amazing sense of openness for<br>experimentation and new ideas and not<br>every conversation goes super deep but I<br>definitely feel it that there's a<br>possibility to go somewhere with each<br>person I've met so far so that's been<br>pretty<br>amazing and actually I'll just like to<br>add something to that because um I've<br>been I mean I expected you all to be<br>open and friendly to me that's what I<br>grew up with but I've been really um<br>Blown Away by the repar around sort of<br>welcome that I've received not just in<br>the University but just from people in<br>general in the community who've emailed<br>out of the blue and said hey come around<br>for dinner let's do this or you know do<br>you want to go to the DSO um yeah<br>there's there's just been so many<br>opportunities I've been to so many<br>different things just because people<br>have asked me and all of that will go<br>into the work and affect things as well<br>and the other thing that I hadn't<br>thought of until you were talking was um<br>the way people talk has um affect things<br>one of the things I noticed when I came<br>down here I was saying to them at lunch<br>is that quite often in shops when you<br>ask someone something they'll say easy<br>now that's not something that anyone<br>ever says in Hamilton but that's<br>something I've caught myself saying now<br>and how and how I talk is how I write so<br>I mean I know it's going to show up<br>somewhere so if you read something of<br>mine and it's got easy in it you'll know<br>from does anyone have have any further<br>questions I'd like to know how having a<br>chance to do full-time arts practice has<br>enriched your personal health and<br>artists well I can say that it's been<br>amazing it does uh increase your health<br>and wellbeing in just that um to have a<br>year of<br>no uh Financial structure go not having<br>to constantly wonder where the next<br>paycheck is coming from or how to put<br>your kids through school that is amazing<br>having said that I'm separated from my<br>family this year because my kids are<br>still at secondary school and they<br>didn't want to leave their basketball<br>team and their friends and stuff so they<br>are back in taranaki but I have a<br>daughter who is here at otago Uni so I<br>do think it's important for the health<br>and well-being of any creative person<br>but I actually think any person in New<br>Zealand you need to have a break every<br>now and then and not have to fret about<br>your family's well-being because if I'm<br>well I can look after my family if I'm<br>not then that one Falls over too so it's<br>a bit of a domino effect but to nurture<br>my creativity and feel that I'm<br>validated by just being here and being<br>able to connect with the community uh<br>being one in the community and doing my<br>creativity and they actually seem to<br>respond to it that gives something back<br>to me and makes me stronger yes it has<br>been a joyful year thank you<br>ay yeah I agree with all of that<br>um the the health and well-being thing<br>has been is probably a bit more of a<br>double-edged sword for me I spent the<br>first month not sleeping because I'm not<br>used to sleeping without<br>son and he's back in Hamilton um but you<br>know there are video calls he's been<br>down I've been up all that sort of thing<br>but creatively Wise It's been amazing<br>just to have the opportunity where it's<br>okay to play and experiment and try new<br>things um I don't have to worry about<br>being paid for it because I'm already<br>being paid um yeah that's been<br>absolutely massive it's made a really<br>big difference and the other thing<br>that's made a big difference as Michaela<br>was just saying is the validation um at<br>home people know I'm at home when you're<br>at home you're<br>available um and it's not that they<br>don't think writing is a real thing but<br>I don't know when they think I do it<br>because they bring me to do all sorts of<br>other things whereas down here I'm here<br>being a writer and so yeah it it's not<br>only the recognition that you are a<br>writer but that people think that you<br>know you're doing something worthwhile<br>and so they're prepared to leave you in<br>your office for a little while to do it<br>so I've really enjoyed it I mean this is<br>probably been one of the most amazing<br>opportunities I've ever had the only<br>thing that could have made it better<br>would have been of could have come to<br>but he couldn't leave his job but yeah<br>I've really really valued it so yeah<br>everybody uh yeah I'd like to just to<br>talko all both of those points<br>um yeah there's always kind of a um bit<br>of a contradiction I think with Alis<br>that um you know art itself and the<br>process of making art is so good for<br>your mental health but the this the<br>struggles of a freelance career are very<br>bad for your mental health so so this is<br>kind of um you kind of seesaw that um<br>artists often have to go through and so<br>um just having the<br>stability um that this position offers<br>has been a real God send um to<br>experiment and to also yeah kind of<br>um you know think about aspects of<br>physical health as well um I've thought<br>about going to the gym haven't been yet<br>but yeah<br>yeah so yeah um yeah it's very positive<br>general I'm thinking a lot about um how<br>we divide things in our life and the<br>idea that there's the the artistic part<br>and then there's the Practical part and<br>then there's the family part and for me<br>that doesn't really work so well I find<br>that um I of like these things often mix<br>and blend up through each other and so<br>somehow um in order to keep working when<br>for example I have to take care of my<br>family I try to really also see how um<br>there's these artistic uh ways of doing<br>that and um sources to get out of from<br>being um responsible for many things at<br>the same time um there's one other thing<br>I wanted to say about that now it<br>skipped my mind um oh yeah<br>self-production um dance um requires<br>from the people that are engaged in the<br>field an enormous amount of self-<br>production so even though I have the<br>support of a six-month salary and the<br>project is 6 months long I'm spending<br>probably I would<br>say yeah probably 75% of the time on my<br>computer um doing like promotion writing<br>back to emails connecting to various<br>people in the community um designing<br>these post these things this takes like<br>a week of time sometimes to get it just<br>right um also thinking about where do I<br>put up posters who's going to do that is<br>there somebody's going to can help me<br>with that like I don't know just like<br>there's not a structure that's set up<br>for me to just go and do my art in<br>because I have to create the Community<br>First which is like a marketing campaign<br>and it's on one person of course with<br>the support of other networks like I<br>mentioned Anna already so thank you<br>again Anna but um so that it it's like<br>the amount of time that you spend um on<br>the actual creative moment like in the<br>dance class is then the the most minimal<br>amount of time and it would be amazing<br>if that could be um 50% of the time or<br>even 90% of the time but for most um<br>dance artists it's a lot about self-<br>production and um being like your own<br>marketing company in order to actually<br>create the network then you that you can<br>use use to work together in um and so<br>yes it's been very supportive like more<br>than any other situation I've I've been<br>in to have this fellowship and I'm<br>really grateful for it but I just also<br>want to say that um even with support<br>most of the artists and the dancers are<br>self-producing everything and don't have<br>a company to do that so it's just good<br>to thank you we probably got time for<br>one last question if anyone H<br>it otherwise I'll Just Dance back to my<br>seat<br>easy question okay we'll give you one<br>more no else<br>came I would like to know how this year<br>longterm well I think Marcel touched on<br>it we are all actually self-producing<br>things and supporting other people and<br>communities as well whether it's through<br>Society of authors networks or working<br>with the people in the Pacific huge<br>amount of time goes to<br>promotion and putting out press releases<br>doing judges reports whatever and most<br>of it is not paid but this year I've<br>been um able to put out a couple of<br>manuscripts because I've had the time to<br>look at them and also put in things for<br>things I wouldn't necessarily put um in<br>uh like<br>for two competitions I never enter<br>competitions or to a couple of<br>anthologies and I've been asked to put<br>out work so what that means is that I'm<br>actually looking at a pipeline of things<br>coming out so there's a novel uh that<br>has New Zealand connections that is just<br>being taken up in Finland there might be<br>a new English novel coming out here then<br>there might also be translation work all<br>of that takes a lot of time and so to be<br>able to put things in the pipeline means<br>that it looks like you have several<br>years worth of work but you know you<br>need to be ahead and you need to plug<br>them in and as fa was saying before you<br>don't know what is being taken or if<br>something Falls over and you have to<br>start again from scratch so it's very<br>important for everyone of us who's kind<br>of an active professional artist to be<br>able to show that we have work in the<br>pipeline otherwise we don't get new<br>opportunities and it's kind of like this<br>domino effect Catch<br>22 yeah I've never self-published or<br>anything I only publish usually through<br>traditional Publishers and educational<br>Publishers um but my entire career has<br>just been an organic thing that's kind<br>of started because I wanted my kids to<br>see themselves in box I mean they're all<br>adults now but<br>um even with things that have happened<br>here so I've done a lot of presentations<br>down here and people who know me will<br>know I hate being in front of people um<br>but I do one and then two or three<br>people are there who see it who think oh<br>this might work for us and suddenly I'm<br>doing something that's not quite the<br>same but it's a little bit different<br>that's come from that one thing and<br>writing is exactly the same you know you<br>write an article for this and then<br>somebody else is like oh I didn't know<br>you were doing that you know can you do<br>this sort of thing for me as well and so<br>it's really hard to say how this is<br>going to affect what's coming because it<br>just goes out in lots of different<br>directions and I don't know which<br>directions it's going to come out in but<br>I've already um you know made lots of<br>different um sort of mini networks down<br>here I've been asked if I can um come<br>and take part in things that probably<br>people wouldn't have thought of you know<br>including men before just cuz they<br>didn't know me because I tend to stand a<br>room on my own um yeah I think you never<br>know what the ripples of these things<br>are I mean a couple of years ago I was<br>writing Residence at Massi University<br>and Michaela was the year before me and<br>things are still Rippling for me from<br>that one let alone from this one so you<br>just you don't know what's going to<br>happen<br>much much the same really um yeah it's<br>just the question of momentum you know<br>it's momentum is so important to gather<br>and it's um very easy to lose and um<br>hard to get back again so um yeah<br>thing for myself I think it's just<br>opened up um my my ideas of who and how<br>many different kinds of people I can<br>work with also in the future so just<br>interest in working with more diverse<br>groups of people that I have in my past<br>and I'm really being now more much more<br>comfortable with that as well and um in<br>terms of for the future like the more<br>immediate future um I just wanted to let<br>you know that there's going to be a<br>performance um on the seventh and 8th of<br>September in the new athenium theater<br>which is just across the street it's a<br>small space that there will be 24<br>performers all very diverse and um<br>they're not professional dancers most of<br>them um they're just people who enjoy<br>movement in different in various ways<br>and I'm still also looking for um about<br>eight more<br>participants um so if you know someone<br>in your life that um you feel would<br>enjoy and benefit from being on stage in<br>a community of performances we're all<br>going to do little solos um please let<br>me know and I also have brought many<br>more of these um little cards right here<br>these little frames for making your own<br>dances um which I am going to pass<br>around so each one of you can take one<br>home and there's my address on the back<br>that you can check out a little bit more<br>about the project or get in touch if<br>you're interested um for me to come give<br>a dance Workshop or anything else in the<br>next two months that I'm here I'm very<br>happy to have a coffee and talk about<br>movement how it relates with what you're<br>interested in so I'm just going to kind<br>of informal can I that pass them around<br>while you continue yeah okay thanks and<br>while um Mar is doing that um I might<br>just draw us to a close um by just<br>acknowledging all of the fellows um and<br>uh one by one
