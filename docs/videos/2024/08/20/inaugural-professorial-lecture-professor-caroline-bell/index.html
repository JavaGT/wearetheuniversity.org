She led the planning and implementation of the clinical and psychosocial responses to both the earthquakes and the mosque attacks. She has shared findings from her work widely with communities and agencies across New Zealand and internationally. <br><br>Based at the Department of Psychological Medicine, Christchurch, her research has examined the spectrum of outcomes after exposure to the Canterbury earthquakes in 2010/2011 and the mosque attacks in 2019. This has included those with significant distress and those identifying as resilient. She has investigated how trauma effects that brain, factors associated with both adverse and positive outcomes such as resilience and post-traumatic growth, and the role culture, spirituality and religion may play.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>it really is a very great pleasure to<br>introduce Professor Bell um Caroline<br>trained in Cambridge in Oxford in<br>medicine and then trained in Psychiatry<br>for another many years in London and<br>Bristol and developed an expertise in<br>anxiety disorders and a really<br>burgeoning research career in anxiety<br>disorders and then she came with her<br>husband Richard to have a look at the<br>possibilities in Christ Church for a<br>short visit in 2002 and bought a bit of<br>land and so she really had to come and<br>work here as well because they bought<br>this bit of land to build a house so she<br>joined us in<br>2002 and worked in the dhb halime and in<br>the university halim and continued her<br>career um and became head of the anxiety<br>disorders service with a a great<br>expertise and anxiety disorders and then<br>in 2011 things of course changed<br>dramatically and Carolina's the expert<br>in anxiety disorders became the person<br>who was called upon to lead the dhb<br>response to the earthquake the<br>psychosocial response and she did that<br>she wased from our department so there<br>was quite a an impact on her research<br>career and despite that of course she's<br>she's reached where she is today she got<br>back to us briefly in 2015 before<br>tragically the mosque attacks in 2019<br>once again took her away to lead the dhp<br>be psychosocial<br>response um she continued to do that<br>through Co again a a situation that led<br>to a lot of anxiety amongst the<br>population she's really developed a<br>world expertise and reputation for<br>leading the responses to these sorts of<br>disasters um so the the final thing I'd<br>like to say is that Caroline's been a<br>close colleague for 22 years and I I<br>would say she's the most supportive<br>hardworking colleague I've had and I can<br>see a lot of people in the audience<br>nodding I know many of my colleagues<br>believe the same so it really is with<br>very great pleasure that I introduce<br>Caroline and ask her to present her<br>professorial lecture<br>tenoa asalam<br>alak gosh it's so nice to see see<br>everybody here I was thinking ah it's<br>just such fun and then I remember I've<br>got to talk but um anyway I really<br>appreciate seeing you all here and<br>sharing this experience with me and<br>giving me the opportunity to share what<br>I've learned working in disasters over<br>the last decade as Richard says um in<br>Christ Church where nothing happens but<br>everything happens you know who<br>knew um so it's customary at events like<br>this for me to tell you a little bit<br>about the journey that led to me<br>standing here before you this evening so<br>I'm just going to briefly um start with<br>that so I was born and brought up in the<br>southeast of England in a town called<br>leyon sea um which is a bit of a<br>euphemism because it was the tempester<br>which is quite Brown and muddy and not a<br>bit like the oceans around us<br>but that notwithstanding I I had a<br>really wonderful um childhood with my<br>two parents who've um sadly recently is<br>passed away and two younger<br>brothers so most of what I'm going to<br>tell you about my journey is about<br>people that have influenced me along the<br>one ah hang on so as I said mainly it's<br>been people that have influenced me but<br>there's one exception to that is um<br>Cambridge University this is the backs<br>of the Cambridge colleges um in a day on<br>a day like today really and I went there<br>when I was about 9 or 10 and that's me<br>how sweet 9 or 10 um um with my family<br>to visit and I remember walking around<br>and thinking this is the most amazing<br>special place I've ever been and I<br>really really really want to go there to<br>study so I did work really hard and in<br>1981 I went to Cambridge to study<br>medicine and Rich doesn't know I've got<br>that<br>picture and I know it's a really bad<br>picture this is a picture of my husband<br>Richard on our first day at Cambridge<br>moving into college so he's got a frying<br>pan in his arms I think and we had we<br>hadn't met on that first day remember<br>those Blissful times rich<br>but we met the second day um when I<br>managed to set on fire the kitchen that<br>we shared so not my best moment but<br>we've been together for 40 years since<br>then and there have been no further<br>actual fires but plenty of metaphorical<br>ones that Rich has put out along the way<br>so thank you for that<br>rich so Cambridge had a huge influence<br>on me personally but also professionally<br>um and it was there there I had the<br>experience of being taught by people who<br>were researching conditions developing<br>theories and then teaching us about them<br>and that just seemed to me really<br>exciting I know my kids are going mom no<br>so sad but anyway I I found that really<br>exciting and it's so deceived that I I<br>really wanted to do research at some<br>time<br>somehow as Richard said I then went to<br>Oxford and did my clinical training and<br>there decided that I wanted to do<br>Psychiatry because it just seemed so<br>unworked out and so complex and so<br>interesting I just thought I I wanted to<br>work in that field so I then moved to<br>London and um and completed my<br>Psychiatry training and this is a<br>picture of one of the psychiatrist there<br>who's was called or is called Lyn<br>Drummond um and she had worked under<br>Isaac Marx who was really the professor<br>a professor at the morsley who was the<br>grandfather of understanding anxiety and<br>behavioral treatments and she was hugely<br>influenced by him and she ran a national<br>service for the treatment of really<br>severe anxiety disorders and I thought<br>that was just a really interesting area<br>and I wanted to work in<br>that and when I finished my training um<br>thinking this is the time I need to do<br>research so I then moved to Bristol to<br>work under Dave nut who many of you will<br>know because he's visited here several<br>times so he at that time we had immense<br>expertise in anxiety disorders and<br>actually had been working with Paul glue<br>who's now in Dan Eden um but wasn't Paul<br>wasn't there by the time I I came to<br>Bristol so as many of you will know<br>Dave's uh Larger than Life<br>character in size and mental capacity<br>really but um and it was had a huge<br>influence on my career um he works in<br>the field of<br>psychopharmacology and understanding how<br>the brain is impacted by conditions and<br>so I completed my doctorate under him in<br>serotonin and how it's involved in sleep<br>and<br>anxiety so David also emphasized to all<br>those around us that it's really<br>important to be able to convey our<br>findings not just in papers but to<br>communicate it to the public and he<br>worked very hard in training us to do<br>that and always be able to tell a<br>story so I'm going to attempt to do that<br>later this evening and then as Richard<br>said in the early 2000s um rich and I<br>moved with our two super young children<br>at that stage to um new New Zealand and<br>worked have worked with Richard um since<br>at the department of psychological<br>medicine initially with Peter lovely to<br>see you<br>Peter um and soon after arriving were<br>started working at the anxiety disorder<br>service and many of you um are here so<br>thanks so much for coming um I really<br>appreciate it so when I arrived at<br>anxiety I I felt pretty confident that I<br>understood a lot about anxiety and how<br>it impacted the brain and how to treat<br>it with<br>medication but in my almost 10 years<br>there I also really learned the power of<br>psychological treatment and how<br>effective this is when it's done well<br>and that's gone on to influence a lot of<br>what I've done subsequently so thank you<br>guys as Richard said the earthquakes<br>then started and what I'm going to tell<br>you about tonight is the start of that<br>work um that I've done in the field of<br>disasters since then and that's really<br>um had two lanes in a way treating<br>people with um mental health conditions<br>since the disasters like postraumatic<br>stress disorder but also recognizing<br>that the earthquakes had impacts on<br>people who weren't developing mental<br>health conditions but were having<br>difficulties so trying to understand<br>well so just reminding ourselves this is<br>February the 22nd 2011 when the<br>earthquake started well hit and the city<br>fell and and I'm sure many of you look<br>at that picture that feels like a<br>lifetime away but at the same time like<br>those experiences seem relatively<br>present all at the same<br>time and these pictures are emphasizing<br>you know the the destruction everywhere<br>um but also that people's homes were<br>damaged and destroyed and I remember<br>hearing insurance companies talking<br>describing that as units and it used to<br>drive me mad and I really pointed out to<br>them when people's homes are affected it<br>has huge impacts on people it's where<br>you expect to be safe with your family<br>and that ongoing stress of trying to<br>resolve that and making it making it as<br>good as it can is really difficult for<br>people there also pictures of<br>liquefaction I didn't even know that was<br>a word before um 201 101 but hugely um<br>difficult for many people having to<br>constantly D dig out their<br>homes and the final point I wanted to<br>highlight from this is this picture top<br>right which is the picture of uh the<br>student Army from Canterbury going<br>around digging people out but there were<br>many other examples like the farmy Army<br>driving in but I think we've all got<br>some personal experiences of people<br>doing amazingly good things often you<br>didn't know them and they would help you<br>out unexpectedly so in the midst of all<br>this<br>Devastation good things happen<br>um the<br>aftershocks um so over 10,000 in 2 years<br>and you know if you look at the second<br>panel over a week that's over<br>45<br>aftershocks and you remember anyone that<br>got near to four you were kind of<br>preparing yourself for is this going to<br>get bigger am I going to need to do<br>something and I often say I don't think<br>there's many ethics commits that would<br>allow you to put rats through that that<br>number of averse<br>shocks with with with with that in such<br>years okay so with we've talked about<br>the acute stressful things that happen<br>in the context of a disaster you know<br>the buildings falling um the aftershocks<br>that happen but we've become more and<br>more aware of secondary stresses things<br>that unfold after a disaster so um<br>people's families being hugely disrupted<br>the<br>really long-standing wrangles with<br>insurance agencies delays in rebuilds<br>Financial pressure on people workplaces<br>being relocated and the start of the<br>Beloved shared spaces um and the change<br>to the landscape of the city you know<br>everything looked different and if you<br>think about it that's people being hit<br>on every front at home at work in the in<br>their environment around<br>them so of course that's going to have<br>an impact on people and we've become<br>more aware that these secondary<br>stressors for many people were bigger or<br>at least as big but if not bigger than<br>themselves so there is a whole<br>literature on disasters how disasters<br>around the world have affected different<br>communities and this is sort of a<br>summary of those<br>findings they all say that the disaster<br>is just the start of a really complex<br>series of Life events that people then<br>have to<br>face you have those acute reactions to<br>being in a really terrifying experience<br>so being very anxious being very jumpy<br>scanning for threat everywhere which<br>many of us had for months um and that's<br>a normal and Universal<br>experience and then layered on top of<br>that are the reactions to those strien<br>iny stresses the things that are<br>grinding people down and they would be<br>people being<br>frustrated angry feeling overwhelmed not<br>having control about<br>situations and difficulties with<br>concentration and I'm going to touch on<br>that later but that's also really<br>difficult because it's at a time when<br>people are being asked to make really<br>decisions we also know that the severity<br>of of the exposure is important so if<br>people directly experience the event or<br>if they lose<br>someone if a community is targeted<br>specifically that tends to have poorer<br>outcomes than a natural disaster so for<br>example a terrorist attack attacking a<br>community has more detrimental effects<br>than a disaster in<br>general that it's not so much the thing<br>that happens the event that happens but<br>it's the person's perception of threat<br>associated with that so how threatening<br>they felt that was for their<br>life in terms of timing we know a lot<br>about the acute impacts but very little<br>about the longer<br>term and all the work says that the<br>majority of people do not go on to<br>develop a mental health disorder but a<br>minority do and that's typically PTSD<br>and<br>depression so this is just depicting<br>what I've just said in a in a sort of<br>graph pattern but what it's showing is<br>that most people follow the blue and the<br>green lines so they have some<br>difficulties those acute reactions and<br>then they gradually improve over time<br>with no longer term<br>difficulties but the minority who do<br>develop mental health problems have them<br>either from the outset the red line or a<br>delayed onset when they're just about<br>managing and then some tipping or final<br>functioning okay so we knew a lot about<br>disasters um but this isn't my work this<br>is Ben beagle holds work who's just<br>there as part of his PhD so Ben thought<br>while we know a lot about disasters in<br>general it would be really important to<br>know about the impacts of natural<br>disasters they might be different<br>because it's a whole Community being<br>impacted at the same time and that might<br>have different outcomes so he set about<br>looking at all the literature that<br>investigated<br>that and although there is a lot of<br>there are a lot of Publications which<br>report on this is the rate of mental<br>health disorders right now that's not<br>particularly useful if you can't compare<br>them with either measures beforehand or<br>a community that hasn't been exposed to<br>a disaster so Ben looked at all the<br>studies there were that had measures<br>before a disaster and after a disaster<br>or had people exposed to a disaster<br>compared to a representative sample that<br>were not exposed to a disaster in order<br>to answer that<br>question and then this is a forest plot<br>don't ask me about statistics of this<br>but Ben afterwards we'll be happy to<br>talk you through um this shows that if<br>you're this side this is the line that's<br>important if you're this side of the<br>line that shows there were fewer mental<br>health disorders after a disaster if<br>you're this side of the line there are<br>more mental health disorders after a<br>disaster so this shows there are<br>remarkably few really good studies that<br>address that question but all of them<br>that have been done are in the direction<br>of showing there's an increase in mental<br>health disorders after a natural<br>disaster and at a rate of about 1.8<br>rate so there've also been some really<br>influential studies from the Christ<br>Church health and development study um<br>so Joe yep Joe Joe and Joe and James um<br>are involved with those but this is an<br>amazing study that's followed children<br>from 1,200 children from birth to now<br>over 30 years over 40 years sorry with<br>measures of just about<br>everything and remarkably half that<br>sample were in Christ Church at the time<br>of the earthquakes and half were not so<br>this H this is a study which has<br>measures both before and after the<br>earthquakes and also a group exposed to<br>the earthquake and not exposed to the<br>earthquake I mean a pretty well perfect<br>study in many ways and certainly one<br>that was included in Ben's<br>metanalysis um that I talked<br>about so this looked at the rates of<br>mental health disorders at two years and<br>seven years after the earthquakes and<br>this showed that at two years um in<br>those who were highly exposed to the<br>earthquakes compared to those not<br>exposed those highly exposed had<br>increased rates of mental health<br>disorder at a rate of 1.4<br>times and when that group were followed<br>up at seven years they still had<br>increase rates but at a much lesser<br>degree so now<br>1.1 so longer term impact yes but less<br>so this study was also able to look at<br>the um measures of distress that people<br>were<br>experiencing um and really importantly<br>found that it wasn't the shaking and the<br>destruction that people experienced but<br>the distress from it that influenced<br>outcomes and also importantly not just<br>distress in the immediate onset time of<br>the earthquake but those the longer term<br>stress associated with those secondary<br>stresses and that's a really important<br>finding because that's something we can<br>do about do something about if we can<br>reduce the distress people feel from<br>having unresolved um buildings and<br>insurance claims we can actually improve<br>mental health outcome so that's a really<br>finding okay<br>so we've talked about um the impact of<br>disasters causing mental health<br>difficulties this is just a really<br>summary slide of a huge amount of work<br>done by the earthquake treatment team<br>which saw people over four years um and<br>treated people with um group and<br>individual therapy and medication as<br>needed and this shows that so that's the<br>number of people fulfilling CR criteria<br>for a disorder and at the end of<br>treatment you know a really dramatic<br>Improvement so look this is not a<br>randomized control trial or anything<br>like that but I'm using it to emphasize<br>that while bad things can cause mental<br>health problems like<br>PTSD good treatment psychological<br>medication can also reverse some of<br>those effects and result in really<br>okay so I've talked about mental health<br>disorders I now want to talk a little<br>bit about the theme of impacts of the<br>earthquakes on people who didn't develop<br>mental health disorders but we<br>frequently heard and God I definitely<br>had it um Quake brain where people were<br>reporting being very jumpy startling<br>very easily which I still do actually<br>but if a truck drives by or something<br>like that and people having difficulty<br>concentrating so it's not unique to<br>earthquakes it's described as flood<br>brain or Bushfire brain in other<br>disasters as well so we wanted to look<br>at that um and we thought we would look<br>at measures that would both look at<br>measures of people's attention to threat<br>and the jumpiness that people are<br>experiencing and also people's memory to<br>try and look at the concentration<br>difficulties that people were<br>reporting and I'm only going to show you<br>little bits of this because otherwise<br>it'll just take too long but this is um<br>how we measure people's attention to<br>threat so we show people pictures of<br>different emotions so anger disgust fear<br>and we ask people to identify which<br>emotion they are seeing so these images<br>flash up on the screen really quickly<br>and we also morph them um into how how<br>much of percentage of the emotion people<br>is displaying so from 100% to 10% and<br>it's it's really hard it's really hard<br>to get right but it's not a test of<br>getting right or wrong it just is a<br>measure of your attention to<br>threat um what we did was we would<br>compar shared these outcomes in three<br>different groups people who had<br>PTSD people who'd been exposed to the<br>earthquakes but had no mental health<br>conditions and actually identified as<br>being resilient and then people who'd<br>not been exposed to the<br>earthquakes and I'll just orientate you<br>on this slide so green is people with<br>PTSD blue is people who've been exposed<br>to the earthquakes but have no but are<br>resilient and orange is people who've<br>never um been exposed to<br>earthquakes and I think what I want to<br>show you from this is that I think you<br>can see that the people who've been<br>exposed to the earthquakes whether they<br>have PTSD or not have different outcomes<br>than people who've not been exposed to<br>the earthquakes it's it all these<br>findings were significant but it's most<br>particularly shown it's easiest to see<br>here and we had very Sim similar<br>memory and then that was at 2 years and<br>then this is at at 8 years and there's<br>no green PTSD bars um here but I think<br>you can see that at 8 years there's no<br>difference between the blue the people<br>who've been exposed to the earthquakes<br>and people who haven't been exposed to<br>the earthquakes and again we got the<br>same findings on spatial memory so that<br>seems to be saying there are issues in<br>the first few years but over time they<br>have<br>resolved so what's the explanation for<br>that and I think this is a a simple<br>explanation for this so normally um we<br>spend most of our time in with the<br>thinking part of our brain the blue<br>prefrontal cortex um as you're sitting<br>here today as long as you're not asleep<br>that's mainly the bit that's active and<br>the pink part of the brain the Primitive<br>part of our brain that is activated when<br>we're in threatening situations is not<br>particularly<br>active but when an earthquake hits the<br>pink part of our brain takes over and<br>and that's good because that allows us<br>to do things that can keep us safe to<br>get out of a situation safely um to send<br>blood to our muscles to be able to get<br>out and we don't need our blue thinking<br>part of the brain we don't need to be<br>thinking about did I get the washing in<br>what are we having for dinner that's not<br>particularly useful right now so we just<br>need to focus on the immediate<br>stress so that is really good and really<br>helpful in an acute situation but if<br>we're in a state of ongoing stress such<br>as I I would suggest after the<br>earthquakes and that prolonged period<br>your brain remaining in this sort of<br>pink space where you're focusing on the<br>stress you're jumpy you're not really<br>thinking about anything else explains<br>those findings it explains why we're<br>more focused on symbols of threat<br>because if people look scared like all<br>those emotions we probably need to take<br>notice of that and do something about it<br>so it makes sense as to why we would be<br>like that and because the blue part of<br>our brain is offline we're not really<br>concentrating very<br>well but over time as I've shown you in<br>normal<br>okay so this is slightly related but<br>this is the allright campaign um which<br>was developed by Community public health<br>and the mental health Foundation lovely<br>to see you Kieran um back there um so<br>this was uh a campaign that was<br>instituted across um Christ Church<br>suggesting to PE that people do things<br>that might help with their mental health<br>so it wasn't targeting people with<br>mental health conditions or anyone else<br>it was just for<br>everybody and this was promoting<br>strategies that effectively activate<br>that blue part of our brain that I was<br>talking about in those previous slides<br>so that is things like mindfulness<br>keeping on exercising keeping learning<br>and so the importance of social<br>connection all those things bring the<br>blue part of our brain much more online<br>doing okay so that was the earthquakes<br>and that work is still ongoing um but as<br>Richard said and we all know on March<br>the 15 2019 there was the horrific um<br>terrorist attack on two mosques in<br>Christ<br>Church so just to remind everybody here<br>of of some of those um horrific events<br>so this was a Muslim Community who were<br>deliberately targeted at Friday prayers<br>which is the busiest um day for many of<br>for people 51 people died the shihada<br>and approximately 250 people were<br>present in those mosques and witnessed<br>what<br>happened the community in Christ Church<br>is small um just 4,000 people<br>approximately and it's very<br>interconnected um because many people<br>have family abroad and so friends become<br>really really important in people's<br>lives so there was a widespread impact<br>for<br>people of course the attack was also<br>live streamed which meant there were<br>high levels of exposure throughout the<br>community and for many people New<br>Zealand was a safe haven and so coming<br>here and having that happened that sense<br>of security was completely<br>shattered and further heightened by the<br>fact that people were vulnerable because<br>of the visible difference in their<br>attire<br>often so this was a community that were<br>targeted specifically for their faith<br>but at the same time could their faith<br>also be protective and that was a<br>question we also wanted to look<br>at so this is um explaining the layers<br>of impact so there were the the people<br>who lost a loved one or were present in<br>in the<br>mosques we know that trauma never just<br>aects the person affected it has ripples<br>with Beyond to the family Beyond to the<br>family involved because living with<br>someone with trauma is extremely<br>difficult so the families of those<br>present the very close Christ Church<br>Muslim Community who many of people lost<br>close friends<br>of course First Responders and emergency<br>personnel and then the wider Muslim<br>Community within New Zealand and of<br>course the wider Christ Church community<br>experiences so with as with the<br>earthquakes there were secondary<br>stresses some in common with with the<br>earthquakes but some more unique um and<br>in this situation there was the change<br>in family Dynamics because often of the<br>person who who was<br>lost then repercussions financially and<br>with housing<br>situations and immigration trying to get<br>people in from um other countries of<br>course unbelievably complicated further<br>by covid um so that was really difficult<br>for people and very significantly with<br>um since March 15 and probably more so<br>than after the earthquakes the constant<br>potential for retraumatization with<br>legal processes the coroners there was<br>in the news today about the coroners<br>reports intense media interest for<br>specific people and other related<br>incidents so constant people constantly<br>getting<br>retriggered so we ran a study from um<br>early<br>2020 um until the end of 2021 which was<br>funded by the health research Council of<br>New Zealand and the Canterbury Medical<br>Research<br>Foundation and the aims of that were to<br>understand both the adverse and the<br>potentially positive outcomes for<br>people's mental<br>health the aim was to do this at one to<br>two years and again to follow people up<br>longer term recognizing the importance<br>of longer term work and we're still<br>looking for for funding to be able to<br>conduct that really important an um<br>piece of<br>work the research needed to be<br>absolutely trauma informed from its very<br>core because of the nature of what um<br>people had<br>experienced and truly participatory so<br>by this I mean involving the community<br>from the start and throughout it uh and<br>many of the team continue to work with<br>us hi guys been great doing the work<br>with you um but that's been absolutely<br>key to this even being<br>possible it was however pretty<br>challenging there were 40 different<br>ethnicities and huge linguistic<br>diversity and just as an example of this<br>this is one item from one measure which<br>obviously everything had to be<br>translated into six languages so um<br>whenever we wanted to change you know an<br>introductory paragraph it was absolute<br>nightmare anyway we saw 189 people um in<br>in over that period and what we found<br>was huge hugely High rates of mental<br>health conditions since the attacks so<br>this is a slide showing that over 60% of<br>people had a mental health condition at<br>some time from when the attacks happened<br>to when we saw<br>them and the most common disorder was<br>depression followed by P T SD and<br>anxiety but of course overlap between<br>them and I just wanted to think is mesar<br>here anyway these slides are courtesy of<br>mazah SED Ahmed who highlighted us with<br>us the importance of us be to be able to<br>communicate these findings to the<br>community these wasn't just dry<br>information that needed to be held in<br>papers but we needed to be able to<br>communicate this in a really meaningful<br>way and the slide sles are thanks to him<br>all the good slides in fact these two<br>mine okay so I've said earlier it's not<br>particularly helpful to just say these<br>are the rates of mental health disorder<br>at this point in time but we were able<br>to um through statistics look at the<br>associations of different disorders so<br>and when I say we I actually mean just<br>doing the stat statistics to look at<br>this<br>so Depression was the most common<br>disorder and we found that Depression<br>was associated with people being<br>bereaved or injured so that makes<br>complete sense and also has been found<br>previously PTSD was also associated with<br>people who'd lost a loved one who were<br>injured but importantly also non-injured<br>survivors so people people who were<br>present at the mosque but who weren't<br>injured and that's really important<br>because that group are often overlooked<br>in terms of needing<br>Services we also found that PTSD was<br>Associated have with having had more<br>prior traumatic events and that's<br>important and somewhat goes against the<br>adage that what doesn't harm you makes<br>you stronger that actually if you have<br>if they have many traumatic events that<br>true okay as part of this study we also<br>asked a smaller number of people 20<br>people in interviews for their<br>experiences in more detail and we able<br>to look at the themes that came out of<br>this and this is the work of shaer and<br>zimna I didn't know you were<br>coming who've done this work um and what<br>this what this shows is that as I've<br>talked about with other design ERS<br>there's distress acutely it lasts a long<br>time and secondary stresses play a<br>really important role in<br>that there were also compounding<br>factors the interconnectedness of the<br>community that I've touched on and also<br>remembering this does didn't occur in a<br>vacuum this is in the context of<br>discrimination and racism that people<br>were experiencing before and<br>after but through it all people talked<br>about the importance of the centrality<br>of their faith that what their how their<br>faith helps them cope and understand<br>their<br>experiences so we also looked at some of<br>that in a different way asking people<br>how satisfied they were with aspects of<br>their life and if you look at the right<br>hand column I think you can see that<br>reflecting what I talked about Earl in<br>the previous slide<br>people were less satisfied or more<br>concerned about feeling safe and<br>feelings of<br>security but some things were better<br>that are better than they had been and<br>these were particularly relationships<br>with people feeling part of the<br>faith so I just want to turn now to<br>those potential positive outcomes that<br>I've touched on just now um because that<br>is found um<br>repeatedly and this concept of<br>post-traumatic growth which was<br>developed in the<br>1990s initially mainly to to do with<br>people going through physical illnesses<br>but more laterally has looked at all<br>disasters and what people find is that<br>these five domains typically increase<br>people report greater appreciation for<br>Life feeling closer to family and<br>friends change priorities like usually<br>less<br>materialistic a recognition that they<br>are stronger than they thought they<br>could be and greater engagement in their<br>spiritual<br>life so we looked at that in the<br>earthquakes um we looked at people who<br>had been exposed to the earthquakes but<br>hadn't developed mental health<br>disorders and this is is the work of<br>Rebecca Smith um from Canterbury and<br>what she found was that all those<br>domains of personal growth occurred but<br>also which hasn't been identified<br>previously a stronger sense of<br>connection with the community and that<br>may be because it was a natural disaster<br>and the collective experience I think<br>that probably is what explains<br>that she also found that people who had<br>a helping role whether paid or<br>um in the Christ Church health and<br>development studies Ben also looked at<br>this as part of his PhD and he found<br>that greater posttraumatic growth<br>occurred with heightened distress and<br>again the importance of that uh<br>subjective experience of distress rather<br>than the actual thing that's happened to<br>you and again this related to both the<br>earthquakes and that the disruption<br>stresses in after the March the 15th<br>attacks we also measured post-traumatic<br>growth and I think you can see from this<br>this is just the mean score so the<br>higher the score the greater the growth<br>and when we compared this with other<br>studies that have reported<br>post-traumatic growth it's really high<br>um so we're looking to understand that<br>people talk about um things they did um<br>connected with their face with their<br>faith such as um a Reliance turning to<br>that so the story um the disaster is<br>just the start of a really complex<br>series of<br>events in terms of mental health most<br>most people are okay in the longer term<br>but a minority do develop mental health<br>disorders so we need to have a plan for<br>managing<br>all secondary stresses are really<br>important and we need to resolve them<br>really quickly and that's important for<br>agencies to take serious note<br>of cultural understanding is crucial to<br>um understanding any trauma um and<br>engaging um the community from the<br>outset is key to making this<br>work bad things happen absolutely they<br>do but there it isn't all negative and<br>we need to have that understanding to<br>picture Okay I want to conclude now with<br>not really my work and Mazar you just<br>walked in but this is your work but<br>anyway it's what I wanted to end with<br>because I think it is just as if not<br>more important than everything I've told<br>you<br>about so what we do matters um I've<br>talked about how something like a<br>terrorist attack um or any interpersonal<br>violence often has more detrimental<br>effects than a natural disaster so a<br>person doing something to another person<br>has bad<br>outcomes but we also know that when<br>people do good things and the right<br>things this also has has an impact we<br>know this from neurobiology we know this<br>from<br>psychology and um I'm going to share the<br>work now and an experience from that<br>Mazar has allowed me to share which I<br>think depicts this better than any<br>graphs could possibly do<br>so uh someone was present at the time of<br>the mosque attacks and experienced all<br>those horrific events and came home<br>obviously terrified by those experiences<br>with his family collects them together<br>pulls the curtains back uh pulls the<br>curtains shut to keep themselves<br>safe and is thinking I can't we can't<br>stay in this country this bad things<br>like this happen I can't keep us safe<br>here they then hear a noise outside and<br>go and pull the curtains and find that<br>their neighbors have surrounded the<br>house linked arms and now protecting<br>them and he said at that moment he<br>changed went back out to the hospital<br>community so Mazar also has done some<br>work on this and found similar things<br>happen spontaneously around the country<br>so this is a picture of a Muslim family<br>swimming<br>surrounded this is a mosque with people<br>surrounding it and he's termed this<br>human chains of araha which I think is<br>just such a powerful way<br>of explaining what happens but I think<br>it really emphasizes that what we do<br>things okay so all of this work couldn't<br>have been done um without the<br>participation of everyone who<br>contributed their findings and this is<br>done in memory of the 51 shihada and<br>with huge thanks to all the survivors<br>from the mosque attacks and also the<br>experiences and look this research um<br>I'm standing here in front of you but<br>this takes a village to do this work um<br>the earthquake team who are here um I<br>can't go through everybody the March the<br>15th project particularly Raya sandila<br>shaer Rana fari acram zimna been an<br>absolute pleasure to work to get to know<br>you and work with all so thank thank you<br>for that everyone from anxiety disorders<br>um I just loved our our time together so<br>thank you for that Andy Bartram I can't<br>tell you how she makes all the messy<br>data we present into this meaningful<br>nice thing that then the statisticians<br>Joe and Chris can do something with<br>because I certainly couldn't without<br>them um Ben particularly being the<br>easiest PhD supervision ever um<br>and mentorship from obviously in the UK<br>Dave nut Peter love see Roger um Lois<br>for much support and and particularly<br>from distinguished Professor Richard<br>Porter for unbelievable leadership and<br>support and I I'm speaking for myself<br>but I actually think everyone in the<br>department feels the same so thank<br>you and last but not least um my<br>children so my daughter turned up<br>unexpectedly today that was wonderful<br>and my son who's hop watching in Norway<br>time and Rich for continuing to put out<br>the fires and like without you I<br>couldn't have done any of this so thank<br>you everybody thank you for coming<br>just</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
