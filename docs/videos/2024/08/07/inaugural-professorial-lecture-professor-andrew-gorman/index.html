accurate.</p><p>called Richard Blakey hi everyone I'm<br>Richard Blakey I'm Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor research and Enterprise it's<br>my great privilege and pleasure to host<br>you tonight for this inaugural<br>professorial lecture where we celebrate<br>the achievements of Andrew Gorman<br>Professor Andrew Gorman and achieving<br>the highest academic standing at our<br>University these uh events are a<br>celebration uh and I'm here to welcome<br>you say a few things in hand over to<br>Professor Richard Barker provice<br>chancell division of Sciences uh with a<br>more formal welcome um it's our great<br>pleasure to invite uh you all here<br>tonight and to those online or watching<br>from the future to this event and in<br>particular um your wife Sandy and<br>daughters Clara Magie are here with us<br>tonight Kiora Coto uh and I believe that<br>online or in the future Connor your son<br>and your parents John or eileene are<br>watching and will watch this uh on reun<br>and I'm sure this is going to be a<br>fantastic event um we uh we uh have very<br>set very high standards for our<br>professorial appointments and promotions<br>at the University of atago we use<br>international referees to Quality assure<br>those processes but quite very simply we<br>require outstanding leadership over a<br>sustained point of time in the main<br>areas of academic Endeavor in research<br>and teaching and service and we're going<br>to uh hear some of that tonight um<br>Andrew works on big issues of global<br>importance it is big science that he's<br>does with big collaborations<br>um supporting work on the land in the<br>ocean and on the ice um and from uh a<br>country that we don't classify ourselves<br>as being big uh but the work that Andrew<br>does in mapping sea floors and land and<br>Arctic and Antarctic Ice Sheets we've<br>got to remind ourselves that our<br>responsibility for this planet is quite<br>significant our responsibility cover<br>about 25 million square kilm of uh ocean<br>and seaf Flor Andrew's work has been<br>responsible for taking a look at some<br>little bits and pieces of that that<br>represents about 5% of the planet so<br>it's big work that needs people with big<br>Ambitions and working together as large<br>teams um Andrew has done that um in the<br>role of an academic teaching and<br>supervising graduate research students<br>many students have come through his uh<br>supervision that have now gone on to<br>significant roles both in Academia and<br>in industry uh the kinds of the kinds of<br>um support that we expect uh from our<br>high level academics encouraging people<br>into their future career paths<br>um it's also notable that whilst Andrew<br>has big am Ambitions and big research on<br>a global scale he has been a very good<br>uh servant both of the university and<br>services and head of department but of<br>our local communities as well and one<br>thing that highlighted that struck me<br>was local service that uh that Andrew<br>has done my father was an academic and<br>would also be the kind of person that<br>would if someone picked up the phone and<br>wanted them to work on a local project<br>wouldn't say I'm too busy that's not big<br>enough for me so that your work with<br>some of the um local groups trying to<br>find buried armaments in some of our our<br>parks and reserves was one that struck<br>me as being particularly notable as the<br>kind of service that we expect from an<br>atago academic at the highest level so<br>please on behalf of the University can<br>we all join in congratulating Andrew on<br>this well-deserved Prof promotion to<br>professorship as I invite Professor<br>Richard Barker to give a more formal<br>much Professor Blakey ten aay Professor<br>Gorman<br>ten Professor Sterling ten AR Deputy<br>Vice Chancellor ten AR friends and col<br>colleagues taroto taroto<br>tenot it is my great pleasure tonight to<br>introduce our speaker Professor Andrew<br>Gorman from the Department of geology to<br>give his inaugural professorial<br>lecture as indicated by Professor Blakey<br>Andrew was promoted to Professor in<br>February of this year and tonight we get<br>to celebrate this significant<br>achievement Andrew was born in Carrick<br>Fergus to me a place familiar through<br>the beautiful folk song of the same name<br>the version I'm familiar with was sung<br>by Van Morrison and the chapon those<br>with a better geographical knowledge<br>than me can tell you that Carrick Fergus<br>is an ancient town in Northern Ireland<br>NN for many things just one it was the<br>last moing place for the Titanic before<br>she set off on her one and only journey<br>across the<br>Atlantic conducting a much safer passage<br>across the Atlantic was a young<br>Professor Gorman dragged I'm using his<br>words by his parents across the ditch uh<br>to set up life in Canada in the small<br>Prairie town of mossbank just south of<br>the delightfully named Metropolis of<br>Saskatchewan the next move took the G<br>Gormans to the northern Frontier Town of<br>Yellow Knife a place that lives and<br>breathes<br>geology like Den Eden it was founded on<br>Gold Mining and unlike Den Eden it is<br>now the center of a thriving Diamond<br>industry Here Andrew developed an<br>interest in geology and the foundation<br>was laid for an academic for for an<br>academic scholarship to the University<br>of Calgary and a place on the University<br>Swim Team he was known as one of the<br>rocks for<br>jocks and Here Andrew met Sandy a<br>trainer for the University of Calgary<br>swim team and I suspect still training<br>day a science bachelors in geology um<br>from Calgary led to a full-time position<br>with Chev and and Calgary in<br>19887 which sparked his interest in<br>research and it also provided enough<br>disposable income for among other things<br>a six We Cycling trip around New<br>Zealand but drawn to Academia Andrew<br>headed off to graduate school at the<br>University of British Columbia in<br>Vancouver where he completed his PhD in<br>2000 followed by a post postto at the<br>University of Wyoming in<br>laramy in April 2002 and Andrew was fled<br>in Eden for a three-day job interview<br>here at the University of otago and this<br>was successful for all parties and<br>Andrew started at the University of<br>otago in January 2003 as a lecturer so<br>tonight we celebrate his progression<br>fully through the academic<br>ranks as we have heard from Professor<br>Blakey promotion to full professor at<br>the University of otago is far from Easy<br>you must excel in all three academic<br>domains of teaching research and service<br>and Professor Gorman has truly<br>excelled as we have heard Andrew's<br>research primarily involves the<br>application of seismic Imaging<br>techniques to investigate geological and<br>oceanographic problems he is productive<br>and has published one book The<br>intriguingly titled moldy and Mining as<br>well as three book chapters and 54<br>Journal<br>articles with his seismic work which has<br>on been on land and ice in Antarctica<br>and on water using our research vessel<br>the<br>Polaris Andrew's work research is truly<br>cross-disciplinary and his projects<br>contribute to research across the<br>university in departments such as Marine<br>Science mathematics and statistics<br>surveying and of course<br>geology has geophysical research<br>necessarily consumes significant amounts<br>of time collecting field data whether in<br>Antarctica or on board the Polaris or<br>laying out instrumental arrays across<br>paddocks in Westland or in fact in our<br>botanical<br>gardens field trips are expensive and<br>Professor Gorman has been very<br>successful in attracting significant<br>amount of research funding to support<br>this including two maren research grants<br>and three M MBI program subcontractors<br>subcontracts one of the standout<br>features of his Publications is that his<br>postgraduate students are Central to<br>almost all of his research and his<br>research is also Central to his teaching<br>in a particular field-based teaching<br>this includes students being taken on<br>the RV<br>Polaris students being taken to the<br>North Island on enhanced field<br>excursions recently made possible by a<br>generation generous donation from<br>Clinton Jan nman locally to the<br>abbottford landslide a reminder of the<br>fact that our Landscapes are Dynamic and<br>POS significant hazards a local Field<br>School to Warrington Beach and one a<br>little further a field to raki Yota<br>Stewart<br>Island incorporating his research into<br>his teaching has been instrumental in<br>fostering talent and many of Andrew's<br>students have gone on to successful<br>research<br>careers the final domain of academic<br>performance that requires Excellence is<br>service to our academic and professional<br>communities Professor Gorman has played<br>a leadership role on the national<br>executive Committees of the New Zealand<br>geophysics Society the geosciences<br>Society of New Zealand including<br>positions as president and past<br>president he is also on the editorial<br>board for several journals including as<br>editor of the international Journal of<br>physics my final comments are on his<br>University Service Professor Gorman has<br>been a member of many University<br>committees and working groups for a long<br>period of time and this includes<br>important committees such as the<br>University Research committee physical<br>sciences panel but for me personally<br>it's his Service as head of Department<br>of geology that's stands<br>out as we all know he's especially<br>cheerful and<br>optimistic despite having to have worked<br>on some really confronting challenges<br>over the last couple of years and it's<br>always with the welfare of his staff and<br>mind and so I want to say thank you<br>Andrew for that but I think you've heard<br>enough from me it is now time to hear<br>from Professor Gorman himself please<br>join me in welcoming Professor Andrew<br>Gorman<br>right<br>to<br>k um I think that starting off a talk<br>with a p like that is is really<br>appropriate for particularly for uh<br>people in the earth sciences and and and<br>and even more so ones who work on the<br>ocean because uh the Mai Mai tradition<br>of of U having a mountain and a river is<br>something that speaks very very closely<br>to most of us in in the earth Sciences<br>uh the view that you can see right here<br>is from the NOA which is on Belfast lock<br>so just down and to the left is the town<br>of carck Fergus that Richard was talking<br>about that I was born in Belfast is down<br>to the right and you can imagine the<br>Titanic right there in in in the picture<br>down below there um but that's not I I<br>didn't pick that as my as my water body<br>I picked uh the Catan as my as my River<br>um because when I was four years old my<br>my parents brought me to to western<br>Canada I spent almost half my life<br>living within the catchment of the<br>Saskatchewan which you can see in in the<br>picture here rises in the Rockies and<br>comes through most of the provinces of<br>Alberta and Saskatchewan into Manitoba<br>and then flows out eventually through<br>the Nelson River into Hudson Bay H and<br>and so so skch and if you if you um are<br>fans of The Proclaimers you'll you can<br>play that back later and you can<br>practice how you say that um with c cap<br>in hand I gave Richard the instructions<br>so he could he could look at that anyway<br>but um the title of my talk was<br>basically making a bang and I was trying<br>to think of things that that I that I<br>that link together the areas of my work<br>and I I think blowing things up is<br>basically part part of what I've done<br>for a good part of my my career and so<br>so I think that's that's where I'm going<br>to try to make the theme for for Le part<br>of this of this talk um I'll I'll start<br>off talking a little bit about what it<br>is I actually do in ter in terms of<br>making those bangs then I'll I'll<br>revisit a little bit about how I got<br>there and then I'm going going to try to<br>bring things back into a little summary<br>of probably five favorite seismic<br>sections which is what the bangs end up<br>making uh that that answer some<br>questions about the world and then and<br>we'll see where that goes from there so<br>most of you know that I like to get on<br>planes and um fly somewhere this is for<br>Phil who's in the audience he wanted to<br>see planes so I've got planes and and<br>flying south to Antarctica get get a<br>great view from from these these uh big<br>American Cargo Jets the c<br>c17s um landing on the ice but then what<br>H what happens when I when I when I get<br>there I guess with withing usually<br>bringing students and and colleagues and<br>tow with me as well um others know that<br>I don't always go to Antarctica<br>sometimes I get in a helicopter and and<br>and if I'm lucky uh and somebody's<br>paying the bill and<br>fly into fjordland or or more often it's<br>getting on a ferry and going across Lake<br>manipuri uh but getting out to the<br>Polaris and putting some some gear in in<br>the water that also makes bangs and<br>collecting seismic data again usually<br>with with lots of students and<br>colleagues so uh I'm going to show you a<br>little bit about what I do when I<br>actually get there um and dynamite or<br>explosives play plays sort of a central<br>role um making a bang is so it's one of<br>the ways that that have made made the<br>bang probably the more more dramatic way<br>these These are the um boxes of of of<br>explosive cord that we had in Antarctica<br>last last season that we only only blew<br>up about half of it actually so we can<br>go back and do do some more coming from<br>some pretty exotic places and with<br>warnings that that are sometimes not<br>even in English um and then putting<br>together things that look like this and<br>shoving them down holes and blowing them<br>up um so I I just just in case you're<br>worried I I do I do have uh uh<br>qualifications from from New Zealand<br>anyway to to do that and uh it it<br>doesn't really look like this so so so<br>that's that's not what we're going to<br>see anyways so so I thought that um I'd<br>start off by showing you a little video<br>of a little bit about what um some of<br>our our sources look like and there's a<br>couple of students in the audience who<br>will recognize themselves from here so<br>I'm going to start off with with the<br>some of the shots some of some the<br>explosions that we made from uh just<br>this last season when I was down at<br>Discovery deep south of Scott base use<br>the end of the trigger wire you can hear<br>this with the wires crossed waiting for<br>heish up there to finish his wiring up<br>job and when he's finished he'll walk<br>away to a safe<br>distance and we'll be able to take our<br>wire and plug it into the dog<br>box and Charlotte can make it go<br>boom so Charlotte has it wired in she's<br>sound there you go and that's that's<br>what happens and we do that c 500 Milli<br>times over the next few days I I put<br>enough marks Apples because they are<br>them so this season this is this all of<br>the downside is that uh when you're like<br>this you'll see in a second that the<br>last survey we had last year was quite<br>easy for putting in sources this was a<br>bit more complicated because we had dig<br>Geon<br>pass the G phone in the hole arms length<br>deep there you go and connecting it to<br>the takeout cable that you can<br>see right here if I was being nice I'd<br>actually be doing this for her but since<br>herself Jenny's a colleague of mine from<br>gns science up in<br>Wellington and J's making it look easier<br>than it really is sometimes these are a<br>pain in the ass to connect<br>so these are essentially the listening<br>devices that are going to record the the<br>vibrations the sounds that we're<br>generating I am armed and ready for your<br>comes and that was it so you can you you<br>can you can you can imagine that Obin I<br>obin's here somewhere he had a much more<br>exciting time than will did because oven<br>survey was the one that blew up 600<br>times um will just got to hear little<br>thuds um and only about 60 of them over<br>the course of of his season but the data<br>in both cases were pretty pretty nice um<br>in the case of the streamer survey that<br>I was involved with last year with with<br>Obin uh we were using a streamer from<br>Alford vam Institute in in Germany uh<br>this is it in its case and you can see<br>that basically it's it's a A system that<br>you can tow behind a sco so you didn't<br>have to bury the geophones in these are<br>the little geophones that Charlotte's<br>wiring up here in this case they're just<br>in little cylinders and they have<br>gimbals and so so they just drag drag<br>behind this the sco and they're much<br>easier so we were able to collect a lot<br>a lot more of them and this is what the<br>the debt cord looked like that you were<br>seeing just just uh blowing up so we had<br>a 10 meter uh section of this which we<br>then wired up and and and<br>detonated um W came back to the dog box<br>and you can see that one of the little<br>detonations is happening there in the<br>background so just in comparison that<br>the survey that we had last year at<br>Discovery deep uh we ended up having 576<br>shots over 18 days so we were getting<br>really productive by the end actually<br>got pulled out a little bit easy a<br>little bit early we have about 600 more<br>shots ready to go for the next time we<br>get get get funding to go down there<br>hopefully in not this summer but the<br>summer after uh and then a typical<br>survey similar to the one that that will<br>would have been involved with would have<br>had much fewer shots that were much more<br>spaced apart but the quality of the<br>shots because they're buried in and<br>frozen into the ice is is usually a lot<br>higher so so with this the 60 shots it<br>still took took about um twice as long<br>to collect of the same uh roughly the<br>same quality and with with actually a<br>lot more work so so we're going to try<br>to stick with the U snow streamer behind<br>this sco method from in the near future<br>so that sort of leads to what actually<br>gets recorded by by the computer and it<br>turns out that what we're measuring is<br>waves um but not not waves like this is<br>is Maggie here that's oh there she is<br>there so my daughter Maggie and actually<br>leani you're in this picture as well so<br>so I'm just see seeing who's here in the<br>audience so<br>if you look right here this boat I want<br>you to keep your eyes on this little<br>video that's happening now because this<br>is Maggie and Leilani at um the uh New<br>Zealand surf surf Life Surf life saving<br>Nationals that were H held the year<br>before this uh in in Christ Church um<br>and anybody else who was there including<br>me um might have a little case of<br>post-traumatic stress disorder by<br>watching this video because it was one<br>of the scariest um uh competitions I've<br>ever been involved with<br>sound off easier um it was it was<br>beautiful weather but this this happened<br>the week after um Cyclone came through<br>and the reason I'm showing you this is<br>because waves is is is what we think of<br>when we think of sound uh flowing<br>through the Earth on a Surface like this<br>we're looking at surface waves which are<br>a little bit different than what we're<br>thinking about traveling out through the<br>Earth but you can imagine each wave is<br>going to have some sort of an amplitude<br>like this one around 3 m and you can see<br>the boats which are making no progress<br>at all getting out through the waves um<br>they they're basically bobbing up and<br>down as the waves come past and so you<br>can think about a wavelength a distance<br>that's happening between the crests of<br>these waves of around 70 Metter uh and<br>then as each as each wave comes comes<br>past um uh you're basically bombing up<br>and down in place so this you'd think of<br>this as as basically a a temporal wave<br>now the boat that did make it out<br>through the waves you can see it coming<br>through here this was not a team from<br>Warrington I don't even we don't we<br>don't want to know where they're from um<br>they basically are showing that the<br>temporal part of this wave so in 13<br>seconds that 70 meters of of of of<br>wavelength equates to how far that boat<br>can can travel when it's sitting on on<br>that Crest people who are into surfing<br>would would understand this as well so<br>you have both this temporal and uh<br>spatial aspect to W to waves now when<br>we're thinking about this in in<br>traveling out through the Earth uh we<br>can think of those waves traveling out<br>in all directions I'm generating waves<br>right Now by speaking to you that are<br>traveling out in all directions in this<br>room a compressional wave is similar to<br>that is what we actually try to image<br>when we're we're sending that sound down<br>into the Earth and equation for Boris<br>and for Andrew you wanted an equation<br>didn't you Andrew so so I've got one<br>equation here which is which is my<br>favorite equation this this this is the<br>the wave equation and it's it's um a<br>differential equation that's that's<br>basically relating the second spatial<br>derivative of of displacement uh to the<br>second temporal uh derivative of<br>displacement and by by understanding how<br>those things relate to each other you<br>can then predict How Sound is going to<br>travel out through different media so so<br>that's Bas that's basically what we're<br>we're thinking about when we're looking<br>at seismic waves traveling through the<br>earth now bringing this back to the<br>Marine example I could have done this<br>with ice as well but here's the Polaris<br>for scale up at the top you can see this<br>little dotted yellow line that's that's<br>going across on the on the ocean surface<br>and I put this together quite a few<br>years ago when I was on a cruise and had<br>too much time uh to to to to play with<br>animations in in PowerPoint but you can<br>imagine the sound coming off the back<br>following these Rays where it's<br>reflecting down off the back off the sea<br>floor and then coming back up to the Sea<br>surface and being recorded by<br>hydrophones which are being to behind<br>the boat so similar to the geopo that<br>you're that's passing around in the room<br>here except one one that senses pressure<br>within the water so basically the same<br>technique you can also get sound waves<br>that travel down through the seaf Flor<br>reflect off the any sort of geologic<br>iCal contact in the subsurface and then<br>come back up to the surface and record<br>it are recorded as well so as the boat's<br>going along it'll have repeated booms U<br>that'll be that'll be going going off<br>the back or if you're an Antarctica it<br>could be these individual shots that are<br>being fired then being recorded by by<br>the the the surface recorders all that<br>stuff gets shoved into a computer and it<br>then it turn and I'll I'll skip over all<br>the fun part which uh a lot of my<br>students spend a lot of a lot more time<br>than in the field playing sitting in<br>front of a computer dealing with and and<br>they you end up getting a picture of<br>something like this so this is this is I<br>I could there might be some people here<br>in the audience who I could test to see<br>if they know where this is or what this<br>is but um one one of the things that a<br>seismic section is is no good about is<br>it's no good unless you have scales on<br>it so you have to think about what what<br>am I actually looking at right here and<br>so it turns out that the horizontal<br>scale in this image is about 50<br>kilometers so this this was taken by a<br>boat and and I'll I'll not I'll spoil a<br>surprise by telling you it's it's just<br>off offshore from uh atago so we're<br>going from close to denan here on the<br>left hand side uh going out uh out out<br>about 50 kilometers offshore and and and<br>then then stopping and then the vertical<br>scale on here um because we're looking<br>at Echoes that are coming back from the<br>subsurface is is in time so we're<br>listening for the time it takes for<br>sound to travel from the surface down to<br>whatever reflecting body there is and<br>back up to the surface again and so one<br>of the things that we really want in<br>geologist we want to be able to know how<br>deep something is how deep is the ocean<br>how deep are these different units below<br>the seaf Flor and so to do that we need<br>to know how fast sound travels through<br>through uh the water or through the rock<br>that we're looking at and so so that's<br>that's something that that um we spend a<br>lot of time trying to analyze in the<br>data as well but uh the the main thing<br>you can see here is you're seeing down<br>to the seafloor it's a pretty rugged<br>seaf Flor as here in this case this this<br>2.5 seconds that you can see here uh<br>would correspond two somewhere around<br>two maybe two and a half kilometers of<br>of depth depending on on the velocities<br>and so we're looking at at water depths<br>here that are over a kilometer deep at<br>that point and these really deep chasms<br>that you can see and that are enzed into<br>the seaf Flor are the theago canyon<br>system that are just offshore so so this<br>is the keratan canyon closest and then<br>heading towards the so obliquely across<br>across the shore heading north um we can<br>also see geological contacts in the<br>subsurface and one of the things I've<br>spent a fair bit a bit of time including<br>one of the margins I've been involved<br>with uh doing is is trying to get<br>Reflections back from oceanographic<br>contact so this oceanographic contact<br>that there is probably the boundary<br>between subtropical and sub Antarctic<br>Waters so it is we we do live we are we<br>are bathed in subtropical Waters Believe<br>It or Not Here in Den Eden all right so<br>that that's basically what a SI section<br>is looking like the the sound the<br>strength of the sound that comes back is<br>is going to be reflected in the color<br>that you can see on this pattern so this<br>is actually a whole loot of little uh<br>sound waves that are smashed side by<br>side over 50 km if you zoomed in on that<br>you'd be able to see individual traces<br>coming coming down through there where<br>the echo coming back is strong you end<br>up getting a dark colors that are that<br>are blue and and red in this case they<br>could be whatever color code you you you<br>want want to make them but that's that's<br>essentially what what what assment<br>section look looks like all right so I'm<br>going to revisit a little bit of the<br>story that that uh Richard told about my<br>how how it all came to this in my next<br>little section so you can sort of get a<br>bit of a feel for what why I ended up<br>becoming a geophysicist um as rich I not<br>not going to do it all but and and<br>perhaps somebody who works in in cold<br>cold places as well so this is a picture<br>of me believe it or not uh back back<br>when I was about six years old living in<br>mossbank in southern Saskatchewan so it<br>looks a little bit like Canterbury<br>except it's flatter and the roads are<br>straighter so so it's U that that's it's<br>not really the most inspiring place to<br>get in into geology but maybe geophysics<br>if I lived there a little bit longer<br>it's it's good for seeing through uh but<br>we ended up moving to much more<br>interesting geological place still<br>pretty flat because it's been eroded<br>away by by glaciers um but this is this<br>is Yellow knife in the Northwest<br>Territories which is either um really<br>really old exposed rock or else where<br>the glaciers have carved down you you<br>get these shallow Lakes um and you can<br>see one of the big gold mines here in<br>the corner with the Little Red Roof on<br>on the top that's the con mine and uh it<br>looks nice in the summertime in the<br>winter this is this is what what uh<br>Yellow Knife looks like it's also a bit<br>like what Prince Albert looks like and<br>what Calgary looks like in the winter as<br>well so I spend a lot of time uh in<br>places that were that were U quite quite<br>uh snowy and Frozen um Richard also<br>alluded to the fact that I was on the<br>swim team I probably shouldn't linger<br>too long in this picture but see if you<br>can find me um and then this this one<br>this one even worse so I went back<br>trying to look for some old pictures and<br>you might even see Sandy in this picture<br>this may be the first picture I have of<br>Sandy I trying to find that when when<br>when I was I think I'm I'm 18 in this<br>too and it's also where um I I really<br>got into into geophysics so so at the<br>same time I was on the swim team at the<br>University of Calgary uh I was also at a<br>a pretty pretty good geophysics program<br>um there as well this is a picture from<br>our field from the field School the<br>geophysics field school at the<br>University of Calgary and we did a lot a<br>lot of uh uh getting out and trying<br>different techniques which I've tried to<br>really duplicate here at aago as well<br>and we'll be having our our field school<br>again at Warrington Beach next month so<br>so we'll be back doing a lot of these<br>same techniques with students this year<br>as well uh when I finished at at at u<br>university I think it was through that<br>combination of of practical experience<br>and and actually being teamwork that<br>I've done with with um uh swimming that<br>got me the job at Chevron it was and it<br>really was like the University of<br>Chevron I had aot a really great group<br>of uh fellow GE physicists who had all<br>started together we we had a lot of<br>train training um projects that that<br>that we were sent on um for those of you<br>who don't know about Chevron it's a<br>fifth largest Energy company in the<br>world it sells petrol and it used to<br>sell Petrol in New Zealand until they<br>till they sold the the Caltech stations<br>uh uh away but it's it's basically the<br>the the parent company of of calex um<br>and it's also where I really got into<br>sort of observing uh geology and and the<br>the the water I guess too in the wild<br>but uh learning a little bit about field<br>methods so this this is a viers size<br>crew that I worked on for a year while I<br>was at Chevron looking a little bit<br>dated now back back this would been in<br>the late 1980s and I was in involved<br>mostly in looking for oil and gas in in<br>western Canada and so I did that for six<br>years and then then basically got got<br>lured lured Away by Academia uh and and<br>the the I guess that's what that's what<br>hook hooked me after that I moved over<br>the Rockies to to Vancouver and instead<br>of going you think by this picture maybe<br>I'm going to become a Marine<br>geophysicist now but instead of that I<br>actually started looking at the geology<br>of U the central part of North America<br>the Katon and and started blowing things<br>up so this was the start of started<br>blowing things up so this is one of the<br>shots from the deep probe project um<br>which was running which ran from the<br>Norther from northern Canada down into<br>the southern states so almost 3,000<br>kilometer long profile um I never<br>actually saw any of the shots go off<br>which is kind quite sad because they all<br>happened at night we we were doing them<br>when they weren't going to bother<br>anybody uh and there wouldn't be any<br>traffic on the on the ground because we<br>wanted to record the vi vibrations a<br>long way away as well as possible um and<br>this this is the one shot I did get get<br>to after it had gone this was actually<br>only a 5,000 kilogram explosive charge<br>so it was five holes each 100 meters<br>deep with the bottom half of the whole<br>cased and filled with explosives uh and<br>then then detonated and so you can see<br>that one of the one of the um pipes the<br>casings didn't didn't quite get the hway<br>out the other one came out and landed<br>here but would the one have been too<br>would wouldn't have wanted to be too<br>close to that um the the shots were all<br>done either in quaries or or places<br>where you could blow things up easily<br>and they were done by professionals as<br>well so uh me meanwhile the rest of us<br>uh spent our time wandering around in<br>fields scantly dressed and digging holes<br>I seem to like digging holes as well uh<br>and or having my students do it and and<br>burying burying seismometer so here's a<br>three component seismometer being being<br>buried in Colorado as part of that that<br>de probe experiment and I'll show you<br>some of the data from that here shortly<br>um after my PhD though I ended up going<br>to to Wyoming and that's where I really<br>got into into Marine Science my my first<br>um my first voyage was on the uing<br>leaving here from from New York New<br>Jersey and heading out to the Bermuda<br>Triangle where we spent two two months<br>uh trying to find gas hydrates in the<br>subsurface uh and we were using uh<br>basically an air air gun Source behind<br>behind the uing and recording it with an<br>8 kilometer long hydrophone array which<br>is what what you can see here coming off<br>the spool and being deployed off the<br>back of the boat uh we also had ocean<br>bottom seismometers which we could drop<br>down to the seaf Flor and record the<br>vibrations the same way as you would if<br>you were burying a geone in the ground<br>except this one sitting on the sea floor<br>maybe two or three kilometers down into<br>the subsurface but then umoa Beck we<br>arrived here with with our kids looking<br>much small smaller than they are now um<br>and and but we're still in Warrington so<br>we haven't moved too far here's with<br>with Allan and Robin I'm not sure if<br>they're here here tonight um who who<br>welcomed us when we arrived and and Gary<br>and Kate Wilson as well so we've been<br>they've been around since the beginning<br>lots of others as well must say um and<br>it's also where I really got my start<br>into collecting some highfrequency<br>Marine seismic data which which we've<br>done you can see if those of you who've<br>been on the on the Polaris recently you<br>can see that that the equipment has<br>definitely improved um the the uh the<br>plotter you can see there on the left is<br>not something I would really wish on<br>anybody if you think the Polaris is is<br>seasick it makes you seasick you should<br>see what the mun did to you um so so<br>that's that I haven't had to think about<br>that since 2007 I Mike Mike trinder<br>that's there right there as well all<br>right so that that sort of get gets us<br>here to to New Zealand and so what what<br>have I been doing so I've got about um I<br>I this this next part could have been<br>could go on for hours but I've I've uh<br>limited myself to five slides which have<br>many little clicks on them and and they<br>and they each are around one one SI<br>seismic section so going back to my days<br>in my pH my PhD project that's really<br>where I got my start looking at at some<br>of these big questions about how have<br>the the crust and and the lithosphere uh<br>evolved so so for those of you who<br>aren't aren't earth scientists I'm I'm<br>looking at the the layers of the earth<br>the outer lay of the Earth is sometimes<br>we know it as the crust the lithosphere<br>is involved with plate tectonics uh and<br>and our our goal with the Deep probe<br>project which is part of lith probe was<br>to um look down as deep as we could with<br>controlled source seismology so all<br>through the 20th century a lot of uh a<br>lot of information had come a lot of<br>knowledge had come about our makeup the<br>of the Earth by using earthquakes as<br>sources but I'll leave that to Mark and<br>and uh others who who like like like<br>earthquakes maybe have I don't if donut<br>here but there's there's a few people in<br>in denen who do do use use use um<br>earthquakes as seismic sources but here<br>we are trying to use control sources and<br>the main reason why you use control<br>Source blowing up your own Dynamite is<br>that you can really um uh tell when the<br>earthquake or or when the sound happened<br>and so if you don't know that precisely<br>then making an image is is is quite a<br>challenge and so and so we we have um<br>this is just one of our shots that<br>happened in Northern Alberta and I've<br>got three different colors here which<br>correspond to sound that's traveling<br>along different Rays the red ones are<br>rays that are traveling through the<br>crust so they go down and they curve and<br>come back up again as the velocities get<br>faster the light blue ones you can see<br>here are rays that are traveling down<br>and reflecting off the the boundary<br>between the crust and the mantle which<br>is called the moo and then the the light<br>green ones are ones that are traveling<br>down and traveling through the upper<br>part of the mantle and and these are<br>ones that haven't been recorded much by<br>by control Source methods before mostly<br>because they're traveling so far you can<br>see that the the the horizontal distance<br>on here is in kilometers so from the<br>distance that that we where the shot was<br>here this would have been one-onone<br>similar to the one I showed the picture<br>of there with 5,000 kgs we're looking<br>1,200 Kil uh kilometers away so this<br>would be like setting setting off a shot<br>here and recording it in Northland so so<br>it's a it's a a long long way away and<br>it means that we could see down maybe as<br>much as 120 130 kilometers into into the<br>earth into the upper mantle and the<br>reason for doing that was trying to<br>understand the makeup of in this case<br>North America Continental makeup um in<br>New Zealand we don't we Nick Nick has<br>has has just been lecturing on some of<br>the some of the uh interesting<br>continental crust that we have in New<br>Zealand but but here the crust is a lot<br>older so these these red blocks are Kean<br>crust which is getting up over several<br>billion years old and most of the core<br>of of North America is made up of this<br>archan or slightly younger um over a<br>billion year old protozoic crust and so<br>it was these blocks of really really<br>ancient uh Continental uh pieces that we<br>were trying to image with the uh deep<br>probe experiment and so I'll skip over<br>some of the the data but this is<br>essentially what the last Model looked<br>like um that that that was basically<br>that the output of my of my PhD um<br>looking at the three main blocks that<br>you can see here through Southern<br>Alberta and and Montana going down into<br>Wyoming and the these These are old old<br>blocks that that would have originally<br>been separate continents that collided<br>together would have had subduction zones<br>between them which you can actually<br>still see which is pretty amazing so the<br>these subduction zones the blue here and<br>the and the and the dark dark one here<br>are actually have Reflections that come<br>back from them so we know that we have<br>have U uh something that's been<br>preserved as a seduction zone for<br>probably more than two billion years<br>which pretty amazing and then then<br>underneath Wyoming and little bit of<br>this Medicine Hat Block near this is on<br>the the southern part of my survey<br>mostly on the American side is this more<br>recent pic underplating so having this<br>this picture for the first time of of<br>what the the structures of these um<br>blocks was like was was was a lot of fun<br>to be involved with uh not not only that<br>but on top of this uh basically you have<br>four kilometers of sediment which which<br>I'm ignoring for this part that that's<br>where most of those wheat fields of<br>Southern saskatch when are located okay<br>so that's one the the second one um I'm<br>skipping ahead now to my days when was<br>doing a postto at at the University of<br>of Wyoming and that's really where I got<br>into to Marine geophysics uh it's<br>similar to the sort of data that I<br>worked with when I was in the oil and<br>gas IND industry as well so um Marine<br>seismic methods have been been around<br>probably since the 1960s they've really<br>been uh had had their had their um<br>successes once uh positioning technology<br>came along and they've been responsible<br>for finding a lot of the largest oil and<br>gas uh fields in the world if you look<br>at the North Sea uh North Africa the the<br>Gulf of Mexico<br>Brazil the slope of of Australia those<br>are all owe themselves to the seis<br>seismic method and and so it's it's a um<br>I guess arguably what's caused a lot of<br>our problems today um but it's also<br>given us a lot of information about<br>what's in in the subsurface and so when<br>we were out here uh in in 2000 at the<br>Blake Ridge in the middle of the Bermuda<br>Triangle we were looking at these<br>features on the seaf Flor this is a map<br>of the seaf Flor using uh multi-beam<br>data and you can see there's this this<br>really strange pattern on this SE Flor<br>here which is quite deep more than two<br>2,000 met deep at this point and this is<br>what these look like in cross-section<br>with with the uh with the seismic<br>sections so we we we looking at a place<br>where there's these amazing sediment<br>waves which are caused by um basically<br>an interaction of ocean currents and the<br>seaf Flor and Below them is a is a<br>really distinctive feature this this BSR<br>um which which is usually called the<br>bottom simulating reflection but when it<br>was originally named it was called the<br> reflection because nobody<br>believed it actually existed but but it<br>turns out it's actually a boundary if<br>you look at it you can see that there<br>are Horizons that cross it but it's a<br>boundary that's there because of of<br>extra gas in the sediment so actual gas<br>bubbles will be in these in these<br>sedimentary units here which are trapped<br>in place by gas hydrates and there's<br>there's the Ying again collecting that<br>data and this is this these are is a<br>picture of what the gas hydrates look<br>like if you drill down and bring them up<br>to the surface so mostly sediment but in<br>the in the gaps between the sediment you<br>find this white stuff which is<br>essentially an ice bonded with with<br>methane and it turns out that it's a<br>huge resource of methane uh on the<br>planet that there's about the same<br>amount of methane trapped up in this<br>sort of stuff here as there is in oil<br>and natural gas and coal reserves all<br>around the world so it's a Hu huge<br>amount and and no real easy way to<br>produce it there have have been a few<br>attempts to try to produce it as a as a<br>fuel um but but rather it's it's really<br>more known now for its uh trying to<br>understand its role in the climate cycle<br>because as sea levels go up and down<br>pressures change temperatures change the<br>stability of these hydrates change as<br>well we don't really understand what<br>their R is going to be um as as we go<br>through um anthropogenically changed<br>conditions in the ocean let alone<br>glacial changes this is what hydrate<br>looks like if you set it on fire because<br>it's it's it's basically a a frozen ice<br>but if you burn it the the methane takes<br>off uh up in the sky and you you'll get<br>the as a flame and you'll find the water<br>um basically dissociates comes up<br>through your fingers so you can hold it<br>while it's on fire I have never actually<br>seen hydrates and I've been working on<br>them for 20 some years uh so they're not<br>very common they only really occur or<br>mostly occur on the seaf Flor or else in<br>a lab which is where that one was made<br>all right running on now to question<br>number three what can we learn about<br>active faults so this is this is<br>something that I was really really happy<br>to get involved with when I moved to um<br>uh New Zealand um Rick Rick sibson and<br>Franchesca gazet took me under their<br>wing and and so the first real fault I<br>looked looked at was The oser Fault in C<br>Central aago and then then I got<br>involved with the Deep default drilling<br>project which was over on on the west<br>coast um with with a with a cast of<br>thousands there as well and so if you<br>look over here on the on this sort of<br>rotated image of New Zealand very<br>similar to the one Donna loves um<br>because because North is sort of up at<br>an angle um but we are looking at the<br>side where where the the U where at the<br>location of woa and this is a zoom in of<br>that region here so you can sort of make<br>out the Alpine fault running diagonally<br>across this figure like this with the<br>mountains on the Southeast side and the<br>flat coastal plains in the northwest<br>side and then the picture we have is<br>basically in around this region of<br>default drilling project to wellsite and<br>over the course of many years I can see<br>Patrick in the audience as well this is<br>part of his Masters we collected all<br>sorts of seismic data from here this<br>this is a Patrick didn't know this was<br>going to be here but this this is from<br>from a paper that we wrote together and<br>along with a few other people as well<br>viously that included Field School data<br>some Masters projects some some<br>dedicated data all sorts of different<br>sources so it was a lot of fun getting<br>over there to try to see if we could<br>image theault and we're pretty<br>successful so these are four different<br>images you can sort of see where they're<br>located here uh where the these two<br>strands of the Alpine fault come across<br>the the opening of The Water Valley and<br>and you can see the the offset beds here<br>uh and it was it was these sort of<br>sections that were really uh key in PED<br>in planning the position for the the<br>default drilling project wellsite which<br>drilled basically down from the the<br>surface and tried to penetrate through<br>through the the the active strand of the<br>Alpine fault so they could see what what<br>conditions were like close to The Fault<br>prior to its its its rupture and that<br>that's another talk for another day so<br>on to number four and this is getting<br>closer to what we're doing now what what<br>can f sediments tell us about past past<br>climate so I've really it's been real<br>real priv privilege actually to spend<br>time in fand over the over the past<br>while um we've been in I think well<br>almost every F I'm still waiting to get<br>into Southerland FJ uh and and and made<br>images of of the of the fjords uh so<br>this most of my time when I go out there<br>is is spent trolling this the the the<br>Boomer gear behind the boat and Mak<br>making pictures like this and um the the<br>the main thing I guess to get across<br>here is that the sediments that are you<br>can see by these flatl lines here that<br>in the fs this is the mouth of the fur<br>over here which is opening out into the<br>tasmin sea this is the the part that's<br>closest to the land this this is this is<br>actually George sound a little a little<br>bit um sort between Milford and and um<br>doubtful for those of you who've been in<br>that area and so so we've got got a line<br>that sort of snakes its way along<br>through the the the bottom of of George<br>sown and comes out to the open open<br>ocean over on the side the Flatline<br>things you can see in here are<br>essentially sediments that have filled<br>in and and the if you look at at a<br>typical F this this is D Del sound<br>didn't have a a similar one of George<br>you can see they u-shaped valleys that<br>would have originally been full of ice<br>and at the end of the last glacial per<br>period that ice retreated and would have<br>basically left an empty Valley behind<br>that might have had someine in it but<br>wouldn't have had much in the way of<br>sediments and so so the um once the ice<br>retreated the the the the interesting<br>thing though is that the Ice Age was<br>still the last last glacial was still on<br>and sea level was considerably lower<br>about 125 meters lower than it is today<br>so it would have been somewhere around<br>where my arrow is on on on the on the<br>the outer side of the of the sill at the<br>entrance to George sound and so George<br>sound once the ice left would have been<br>behind as a lake so so this would have<br>been like lake hoko or something like<br>that would have been fresh water that<br>was that would have filled filled the<br>lake until the sea level Rose following<br>the last glacial and flooded it and so<br>the really cool thing is if you look at<br>some of these features in in in the lake<br>so if we zoom in up to the top end uh<br>you can see features that formed when<br>this was still a lake and so this is a<br>little Delta at the head of um of George<br>sand up here and you can actually see<br>the little sedimentary patterns in here<br>that that are formed by by sediment<br>coming out from the river the end of<br>that Valley um and then you can imagine<br>a lake being formed about 55 met below<br>sea level right now where it would have<br>been damned by by something else as well<br>and so this Delta would have been coming<br>out into into into a little Lake and<br>filling up this Basin uh um that that<br>now no longer had the ice in it once sea<br>level Rose and sea level came back up to<br>where it is now um uh we would have had<br>an ingression of of marine marine water<br>and this would the whole environment<br>would have changed and so some of the<br>most recent sediments that we see here<br>are are going to be Marine sediments and<br>and a big a big part of sort of the<br>ongoing research project that we have<br>here in the department is in fiordland<br>is looking at the nature of those<br>sentiments looking at Carbon storage uh<br>looking at at all sorts of questions<br>about how that has changed over time and<br>it's actually really short geological<br>time uh it's we're probably looking at<br>less than uh certainly less than 20,000<br>years that all the sedimentation and<br>infill has happened uh and we've done we<br>can do the same thing in Lakes as well<br>which is which is I don't know if Sean's<br>here but that I've been having fun with<br>with him in some of the Alpine Lakes as<br>well okay F final one uh is is is<br>Antarctica and I guess I had to save<br>that for last um but what's happening<br>below the RW s shelf that's been a big<br>Focus for for me over the past few years<br>and and it's been a real real privilege<br>to get down there as well um here you<br>can see see the Ross the Ross seat uh in<br>in just a just uh labeled here and then<br>the Ross ice shelf which is in Gray and<br>Scott base which is which is where we<br>always end up flying to is located at<br>the southernmost uh uh point of the raw<br>sea southernmost navigable part of the<br>RW sea where you can get boats to supply<br>um the bases that are there and so um<br>the past few years we've been at this<br>location called Discovery deep which is<br>about 150 kilometers south of Scott base<br>now I didn't have time to flip I I<br>probably probably should have but I<br>wanted to emphasize the fact that maps<br>of Antarctica are a little bit dangerous<br>because which way is North uh and this<br>on this map every way is north and this<br>on this map it's north is definitely up<br>and and and it's pointing but it's<br>totally in the opposite orientation to<br>what the map is on the left so so so<br>because because we're south we're below<br>the South Pole on this picture so you<br>have to flip the map around so here so<br>Scott base is just off the top of this<br>map here so we had to fly south over Min<br>Bluff and got down to our our research<br>area which is indicated here on pink and<br>so we been there for a couple of years<br>this this is some of the data that we<br>collected as part of Will's project um<br>so you can see we're Imaging down<br>through the ice through the water you<br>get lots of reverberations from inside<br>the the floating ice shelf so the ice<br>here is about 500 M thick the water um<br>almost a kilometer thick and then then<br>we get down into the sediments which is<br>what we're really interested in looking<br>at when we went back last year for our<br>streamer survey we end up making even<br>nicer sections which I'm these these are<br>my favorite ones that I've made so far<br>from Antarctica um you can see that<br>we're seeing faults we have dipping<br>strata in the subsurface what we're not<br>seeing is a lot of really recent<br>sediment which is one of the things that<br>we're really looking for for because<br>that's part of the the story for for why<br>we want to to to to look here is we want<br>to see what a recent settlement that's<br>underneath the ice has looked like so it<br>can give us some information on past<br>climate change uh so so this this is<br>showing probably an eroded um part of of<br>the seafloor below below the discovery<br>deep area that we were in before that's<br>carving down through some of these uh<br>older Flatline sediments you can roughly<br>flatl sediments you can see here and<br>hopefully someday in in the future we'll<br>we'll go back here with with drilling<br>equipment uh this is my colleague Davin<br>dumbar from from Victoria University<br>Wellington um over on the cam ice stream<br>Where where we have drilled and and<br>they'll be drilling again this summer so<br>you'll hear about this certainly on the<br>news it these guys are much more flashy<br>than us when it comes to getting teams<br>of 30 people to the field and putting up<br>lots lots of tents and and and bringing<br>lots of equipment we're much more<br>lightweight and hopefully bringing back<br>some sediment so here's some of the<br>sediment that Gavin's brought back from<br>from the Cami stream uh we're hoping<br>that in Discovery deep that we'll be<br>able to drill down 200 meters into the<br>subsurface and and core some of these<br>layers to understand what they are<br>better all right so that's that's<br>basically the science part um just a<br>couple of slides to think about the<br>future and and I'm I'm pretty hopeful<br>for for for Geology and for Geology at<br>atago as as we go into the future we we<br>we know that things like solar panels uh<br>wind turbines batteries uh um even the<br>things that are in your in your<br>smartphone take raw materials and<br>geology and geophysics play a really big<br>role in in trying to find that and and a<br>bigger role and I think one of our<br>messages in our department that we're<br>trying to get out especially to to<br>younger younger kids is that there there<br>are careers here that you can help um<br>help the world get get through the the<br>problems that perhaps have been been<br>caused a little bit by by by geology by<br>by trying to get carbon into the<br>atmosphere um but our Solutions also are<br>going to require a lot more geologists<br>who are really smart and are able to<br>find find these sort of things and for<br>example last year we had at least five<br>of our um uh Bachelor students who went<br>off to Australia to work in in<br>Exploration for Rare Earth elements<br>which are which are required for for all<br>of these things um and just a little<br>plug for the for the conference that's<br>coming up at the at the the end of this<br>year so Mountain C SE which which will<br>be which will be here at the end of<br>November and one of the sessions which<br>is being chaired by a former PhD student<br>in mind Jess Hillman is future proofing<br>energy and and minerals geoscience is in<br>a low emission uh era so so it's a it's<br>certainly a topical topical subject um<br>also I think something into the future<br>is still going to happen as well um I<br>don't know if people have seen Maps like<br>this before but this is a just a sample<br>of some of the seismic data that's been<br>collected off the coast of aago in<br>souland over the last 10 or 15 years by<br>by industry all paid for not by the<br>government but the government was very<br>wly and and and smart and and made sure<br>that ownership remained with New Zealand<br>so we have we have access to all of this<br>data including some some some beautiful<br>3D seismic surveys which I haven't shown<br>you here and this this has been used um<br>as recently as last year but by one of<br>my master students hly hly Meyer uh<br>who's looking at this oil industry data<br>really for for climate science purposes<br>so she's looking at the upper part of<br>the sentiment uh trying to see the<br>record of change that's happened through<br>the last few glacial periods seeing big<br>Canyons that have been ins sized and<br>refilled several times over time so it's<br>been it's been quite exciting to go back<br>and and use all this free data for for<br>pretty pretty interesting topics and and<br>also that this whole topic of of um near<br>surface geophysics near surface uh uh<br>seismic in particular is something that<br>we're getting more into has lots of<br>applications for for earthquake science<br>um this is this was taken ear earlier<br>this year with with Maya one of my 302<br>students and and and I know Mark has has<br>a ongoing project here and the Dunston<br>fault will'll be going back to this this<br>location in the near future we have we<br>have our our weight drop Thumper which<br>which the people in the field school<br>will soon soon be playing with as well<br>so so it's there's lots of amazing<br>things I think that are still still<br>around for the for the future as we go<br>all right and hey Tang hey Tang hey Tang<br>it's all about the people um and um my<br>my wife promised me that I wouldn't have<br>a a lot a lot of thank you so I'm just<br>going to show pictures and dead and and<br>of people um people who teachers and<br>mentors of mine who P paved the way<br>paved the way for me uh from right right<br>from the early days with family and and<br>coaches and and teachers uh uh PhD<br>supervisors and and and postdoc<br>supervisors and and Allen and Richard<br>who are a real um help for me coming<br>here um then all my all my colleagues as<br>well<br>um that I work that I work with really<br>closely now some some of these people<br>you you'll know really well there<br>there's lot lots of others who who are<br>uh have worked with me very closely over<br>the years and I had had to have two<br>pages of colleagues because there's lots<br>of lots of people people I work with um<br>and everybody have who I've worked with<br>in the department here is one of one of<br>the best things that has really been uh<br>helpful in my career has been uh being<br>able to find all sorts of interesting<br>projects of people right from<br>paleontology to to paleomagnetics and<br>and um structural geology and climate<br>science whatever is out there it's been<br>really fun to to work with you all um<br>and I guess and collaborators beyond the<br>university as well it's been great uh<br>being involved in a lot of international<br>projects and some local projects as well<br>um the meetings I go to it's it's always<br>it's always great to get together with<br>people that that are that are u u<br>thinking about the same problems as me<br>um and students I I really couldn't do<br>this without my students I as Richard<br>was saying almost all my papers have<br>have students as my as my co-authors and<br>uh it's been it's been a real privilege<br>to work with so many<br>amazing people over the years and I'm<br>sure that that went in there too fast<br>but I'm sure you'll recognize some of<br>yourselves um those of you who are here<br>um and then F finally my my Fano I've<br>got s Sandy thank you very much thanks<br>thanks Sandy for all the advertising for<br>today as well uh and and um Claire<br>Connor and Maggie and and the dogs uh<br>this is a big big part of my my support<br>but also my parents who are probably<br>watching and U uh the more extended<br>fanel that that you you know who you are<br>um here here in in in New Zealand and<br>around the world it's it's been it's<br>been really great so um thank you into<br>the<br>sunset so um my name is Mark Sterling<br>I'm the professor of earthquake science<br>over at the geology department and um<br>it's myob job to thank Andrew and say a<br>few other things so thank you so much<br>Andrew for a really great um<br>presentation um normally the thank yous<br>would be done by the head of department<br>but um it happens to be the head of<br>Department giving the<br>IPL but it's a real honor to have this<br>position and be able to thank you um I<br>before I give you a uh gift a showing of<br>our<br>appreciation um I just wanted to say<br>that um a few nice things<br>um basically um Andrew's become head of<br>Department in the last few years and um<br>it's been an absolute joy to have Andrew<br>as head of Department we've had some<br>really nice head heads of department and<br>um but Andrew I must say and echoing<br>Richard's comments um he's the he's the<br>man of a<br>optimism he's always smiling no matter<br>what's going on um and uh he has kept<br>our spirits up we've had some pretty<br>challenging times in the geology<br>Department in the last couple of years<br>Andrew's been um there for us and always<br>looking on the bright side of life um<br>but in terms of Andrew's research um<br>something resonates with me that um he<br>has uh gone from the industry geophysics<br>working for Chevron into Academia and<br>he's been able to transfer those skills<br>and become highly successful as we see<br>today and that speaks volumes to me um<br>so um accolades to you Andrew for that<br>um also um yeah as I say the um what<br>you've done for us in the in the<br>department so um without further Ado I'm<br>going to now present you with a gift but<br>before I do you are all um welcome to<br>the staff club for Refreshments after<br>this and I also should thank you every<br>everyone for coming both physically and<br>online and um Sandy Maggie CLA Connor in<br>the abyss of V the virtual world um<br>Andrew's extended family um so thank you<br>very much everyone and hope you will<br>come to the top floor of the SC staff<br>club and and um enjoy more celebrations<br>for this outstanding Professor here so</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
