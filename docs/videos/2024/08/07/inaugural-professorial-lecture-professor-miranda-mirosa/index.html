Vice Chan lari here<br>at the University of Oto I welcome you<br>all here this evening for this very<br>special event to Mark and celebrate the<br>promotion of Professor Miranda Marosa to<br>our highest academic position<br>him I acknowledge all our colleagues and<br>visitors here in person and those online<br>who are gathered together together to<br>celebrate All you have achieved in your<br>remarkable career to this point and this<br>is such a special occasion<br>I really wish to acknowledge your dear<br>Mom and Dad um who are here with us this<br>evening Kay and John Thompson I<br>acknowledge your husband uh Roma Marosa<br>and your three<br>children uh it's wonderful to have you<br>here this evening and I'm sure you're<br>very proud of your mom so this occasion<br>this evening represents years and years<br>of high profile research teaching and<br>supervision and as a consumer food<br>scientist uh Professor Marosa has<br>contributed enormously to new knowledge<br>in this country and internationally one<br>of the roles of the university is to<br>help positively transform Society in<br>your multidisciplinary work and science<br>marketing and psychology to provide<br>insights and interventions for food<br>system sustainability is truly<br>remarkable and has deservedly led to<br>many recognitions including fellow of<br>the New Zealand Institute of Food<br>Science and Technology so Professor<br>Marosa I have been personally inspired<br>um by your research in addition to all<br>you do across many forums I want to<br>acknowledge the significant work you<br>have done in the media including our<br>local otago Daily Times to share your<br>work with everyday new zealanders so as<br>one of um your much admired colleagues<br>it is my greatest Delight to stand here<br>with you this evening to Mark the<br>substantial occasion in your Stellar<br>career and on now hand over uh to Pro<br>Vice Chancellor of Sciences Professor<br>Richard Barker to more fully introduce<br>you a warm welcome to you all here this<br>Oto Professor Ruru<br>T Professor mosa<br>colleagues it is my great pleasure to<br>introduce our speaker tonight Professor<br>Miranda morosa from the Department of<br>Food Science to give her in augural<br>professorial lecture here at the<br>University of Bago as indicated by<br>Professor Ruru Miranda was promoted to<br>Professor in February last year uh and<br>tonight we get to celebrate this<br>significant<br>achievement born in Auto Tah chist<br>Church Miranda went to school in uh went<br>to Primary School in putu and then on to<br>aangi Fielding um in Man 2 where she<br>attended Fielding agricultural High<br>School famous for its farming curriculum<br>for producing all blacks and as a little<br>personal note as it happens educating a<br>bevy of nieces and nephews for<br>me food has always been a central part<br>of her life fortunate to have granted a<br>time when families could enjoy life with<br>extended Gardens that included an<br>orchard um Miranda says<br>25 different trees and a flourishing<br>vegetable garden this was pivotal in<br>shaping her passion for for good and<br>nutritious food and I suspect it also<br>sparked an interest in food waste I know<br>from my own experience I can be<br>borderliner rational when good food that<br>I've grown goes to<br>waste Miranda's interests in food are<br>Global and in trying to unravel her<br>progress from Fielding egg to Academia I<br>noted certificate in international<br>business from otaro University Japan in<br>2002 as part of a study abroad Exchange<br>program a 2005 otago bcom first in<br>marketing management an investigation to<br>Japanese tourist thrill seeking<br>behaviors a ba majoring in French and<br>I've skipped over I think what led to<br>that in in from otago in<br>2007 before completing her PhD here at<br>ago on the slow food movement between<br>her bcom honors and her ba in French<br>Miranda also took part in the study<br>abroad Exchange program to in jeul Leon<br>in the fabulous French city of Leon and<br>2005 now making an educated guess here<br>that this exchange also involved a<br>certain Roman mosa famous for his Data<br>Insights at the University of otago less<br>well known for his culinary talents that<br>I'm told include Friday night pizza<br>perfectly paired with a craft beer and<br>indulgent Sunday morning<br>CP well with all of these Adventures<br>behind her Miranda joined the University<br>of otago initially as a contract<br>lecturer in the department of marketing<br>in<br>2010 before moving to her academic home<br>in the department of Food Science late<br>that year a department she leads today<br>so tonight we celebrate her rapid<br>progress fully through the academic<br>ranks at otago from lecturer to<br>Professor in just over a<br>decade as we have heard from Professor<br>Ruru promotion to professor at the<br>University of otago is not easy and it<br>requires excellence in all three<br>academic domains of research teaching<br>and service and research Professor<br>morosa is truly excellent her research<br>is in Agri food marketing and consumer<br>behavior and she leads a sustainable<br>Food Systems behavioral research group<br>whose mission is change for a more<br>sustainable food future she is<br>productive with 13 book chapters 92<br>referee Journal articles for those who<br>know these things an H index of 32 and<br>an H index of 29 since 2019 those are<br>impressive in addition she has a 2020<br>paper co-authored with PhD student<br>Charlene Lee and Professor bremma that<br>it's already received more than 500<br>ations it's only published in 2020<br>that's really<br>phenomenal her research clearly has<br>impact Miranda's focus on food waste got<br>the attention of the prime minister's<br>office in in 2022 when she served as a<br>key adviser on the working group for the<br>office of the prime minister's Chief<br>science advisor project on reducing food<br>loss and waste in a New Zealand her<br>research which leads us into teaching<br>the second domain in which academics<br>must excel in order to be promoted to<br>Professor to dat Professor Marosa has<br>supervised 11 PhD students in completion<br>it's currently supervising another five<br>she has supervised 28 Master's students<br>to completion currently supervising<br>number another three and these students<br>all feature in her<br>Publications she also excels in<br>undergraduate teaching and I can do no<br>better than to use the words of her<br>students<br>absolutely brilliant teaches a lot of<br>thought on food choice and politics this<br>is a fantastic paper and maybe one of my<br>favorites during two and a half years at<br>otago it is the first paper I've done<br>that explicitly sets out to develop an<br>inquiring mind and facilitate an<br>interest in continued learning another<br>this paper provides great insight into<br>the food industry unlike my other papers<br>which are heavily focused on the Science<br>and Technology of food this paper Shone<br>the light on food and how it's more than<br>just something we eat I enjoyed learning<br>about the social economic economical<br>political environmental cultural e<br>ethical and technological elements could<br>take a<br>breath that constitute the food industry<br>on both a national and international<br>scale personally the most informative<br>eye openening topic for me was the food<br>insecurity content as it opened my eyes<br>more to the reality of food poverty and<br>what is being done to reduce this in New<br>Zealand great words from your<br>students the final domain in which<br>academics must excel in order to be<br>promoted is service to the academic and<br>professional communities here Miranda is<br>also a star she has been a founding<br>member of the Strategic leadership team<br>of the New Zealand food safety science<br>research center and she was a founding<br>co-chair of New Zealand food waste<br>Champions and anyone who has been to any<br>of these events can see the influence<br>that her leadership brings to these<br>initiatives and as we heard she was<br>recently made a fellow of the New<br>Zealand in of Food Science and<br>Technology she is also an adviser to<br>government and for this I will single<br>out the morosa report a highly<br>influential report to the New Zealand<br>parliamentary environmental committee<br>investigating food waste in New Zealand<br>in<br>2019 and<br>2020 she is also an outstanding<br>University CI Citizen and especially<br>noteworthy has been her International<br>work in China including her work with<br>the New Zealand China food protection<br>Network and her role as honorary<br>professor in the international business<br>school sua at Xian xang Tong Liverpool<br>University in<br>China finally and for me personally most<br>significantly Miranda has been an<br>outstanding head of department since<br>taking over the um leadership of the<br>Department of Food Science last year and<br>may I say just one more in an<br>outstanding succession of leaders of<br>this<br>department I think that's enough for me<br>so it's now time we heard from Professor<br>Mar herself one of our fabulous woman in<br>science here at the University of otago<br>please join me in welcoming Professor<br>Miranda<br>you uh Deputy Vice Chancellor tqu prce<br>Chancellor tqu Professor brma ten<br>qu to my family uh my<br>friends uh my colleagues students and to<br>tonight I'm really delighted to see you<br>all here so many of my favorite people<br>in the room tonight and this is awesome<br>so thank you so much for<br>coming okay I'm going to start off by<br>setting the stage for what I hope you<br>will find to be a stimulating Feast<br>first up as an AM I'm going to serve up<br>two versions of what our food system<br>might look like in<br>2050 then as an entree I'll bring us<br>back to reality to<br>2024 and outline the current state of<br>our food system I'm going to make the<br>case there is a need to innovate and I'm<br>going to highlight some of the new<br>technologies and breakthroughs in<br>science and social innovations that<br>offer an opportunity to radically<br>improve our system then for the main<br>course I'll Deep dive into my journey uh<br>and I'll outline some of the specific<br>innovations that I've worked on uh to<br>address food system challenges over the<br>course of my academic career and then to<br>wrap it all up for dessert I'm going to<br>outline my drive to be an impactful<br>academic in helping grow a sustainable<br>and super importantly delicious food<br>future and I'll bring to the table a few<br>of the lessons I've learned along the<br>way so I hope you find some food for<br>thought and I will stop with the<br>puns so sit back and relax the year is<br>2050 climate change has ravaged<br>agricultural lands I'm going to give you<br>a little glimpse into this somewhat Grim<br>future of food there's scarcity and<br>rationing food security is in is rampant<br>droughts and floods of crippled<br>traditional agriculture leading to<br>Soaring food prices in<br>government-mandated rations meat becomes<br>a luxury livestock requires significant<br>resources and lab grown Alternatives<br>remain prohibitively expensive for most<br>black markets Thrive offering smuggled<br>genetic Al modified seeds and synthetic<br>protein bars at exorian costs we have<br>the rise of corporate control Mega<br>corporations control the food supply<br>chain they own vast vertical farms under<br>artificial drones producing Bland crops<br>with minimal nutritional value water<br>rights are fiercely contested with<br>corporations controlling access to this<br>vital resource and using it to leverage<br>uh political power consumer choice is<br>but a distant memory people rely on<br>government issued rations of generic<br>mass-produced food with limited variety<br>we have a crumbling infrastructure<br>Supply chains are an absolute shames<br>extreme weather events and political<br>instability disrupt our transportation<br>and distribution networks food spoilage<br>is a major issue lack of proper<br>infrastructure and energy shortages uh<br>uh make storing and transporting food<br>difficult and there's a fight for<br>survival social unrest is fueled by<br>hunger and Desperation and food riots<br>erupt in major cities as people fight<br>necessities so this Grim version I hope<br>serves as a cautionary tale it<br>highlights some of the uh the importance<br>of both sustainable and sustainable<br>practices and Equitable access to<br>resources perhaps from learning these uh<br>learning from these potential pitfalls<br>we can work towards a brighter future<br>where food security and abundance are a<br>reality for all so let's try again<br>this time let's imagine another brighter<br>future again the year is 2050 we're now<br>navigating a world where smart farming<br>and personalized nutrition have have<br>revolutionized how we grow distribute<br>and consume food so here's a little<br>glimpse into this food system we're<br>cultivating abundance with<br>sustainability at the core vertical<br>Gardens and indoor Farms flourish in<br>urban centers powered by renewable<br>energy and utilizing vertical space for<br>efficient year round cultivation<br>Precision agriculture Reigns Supreme<br>we've got these fields dotted with<br>autonomous Farm robots meticulously<br>analyzing soil conditions and tailoring<br>water and nutrient delivery uh to<br>individual plants we've got aquaponic<br>systems combining fish farming with<br>Hydroponics creating these sort of<br>closed loop ecosystems that use minimal<br>water and land resources we have a<br>neutromed testing to understand the<br>unique nutritional needs based on this<br>data they receive personalized meal<br>plans and recommendations for lab<br>growing meat or algae based protein<br>supplements tailored to their house<br>goals 3D printers are commonplace in<br>homes crafting personalized Meals On<br>Demand using ingredients downloaded from<br>online marketplaces we have a connected<br>food chain our blockchain technology<br>ensures transparency throughout the<br>supply chain consumers can trace the<br>origin of their food with a simple scan<br>understanding the environmental and<br>ethical practices behind each and every<br>ingredient we've got delivery drones<br>overhead efficiently transporting fresh<br>produce from Farm to Table reducing<br>transport emissions and ensuring speedy<br>delivery and we have a community of<br>shared tables communities supported<br>agricultural programs flourish fostering<br>strong bonds between farmers and<br>consumers we've shared kitchens and<br>collaborative uh cooking spaces<br>encouraging social interaction and<br>cultural exchange around<br>food so a pretty awesome some flavorsome<br>future which way will it go obviously<br>I've got no idea while I'm not a food<br>futurist I do think there is uh the sort<br>of exploring these types of<br>possibilities can help illuminate<br>opportunities and potentially obstacles<br>on the path<br>ahead so bringing us back to today's<br>food system I want to start off by<br>making the point it's actually a pretty<br>impressive Global Food system that we've<br>got we're feeding more people than we've<br>ever feed before there's some pretty<br>awesome Innovative products on Market to<br>date the way that we sort of evaluate<br>the system has been based on yield uh<br>but this Focus purely on productivity<br>has come at the expense of human health<br>and the natural environment it should be<br>really easy to be healthy right but it's<br>not our our um supermarkets we've got<br>the flood of sugar on our Supermarket<br>shelves we've got ultr processed fast<br>food restaurants that are clogging up<br>our our main streets and for people with<br>limited time and money it's even harder<br>food companies are also trapped into<br>this system with this Fierce competition<br>they're trying to sort of vying to sell<br>US foods that are cheap and that are<br>sold for the biggest profit margins and<br>these are the same foods that are making<br>us<br>unwell Food Systems already contribute<br>up to 30% of global emissions<br>agricultural land use is the main driver<br>of deforestation and approximately one<br>in 10 people do not have enough food to<br>eat we need to redesign our food system<br>so it allows businesses it allows people<br>and it allows the plet it to<br>flourish so the case for Innovation is<br>really strong our food system faces<br>immense challenges but it also presents<br>a really unique opportunity food and egg<br>Innovations can be really sort of a<br>powerful tool to address some of the<br>world's most pressing issues the image<br>I've got up here on this slide is a<br>framework for thinking about the food<br>Revolution what goals we're trying to<br>achieve and what categories of<br>innovation will help us to get there on<br>the outer part of the framework are the<br>three main policy goals that Innovations<br>should aim to achieve so Innovations<br>should aim to provide proper nutrition<br>uh deliver economic outcomes uh and<br>growth and promote environmental<br>sustainability there are lots of<br>different types of food Innovations and<br>this table provides some examples of<br>food Tech Innovations organized into<br>three categories that are<br>shown uh sorry yeah that was shown and<br>read on the previous slide so the first<br>category of Innovations are those that<br>can increase the quality of foods and<br>farming so by harnessing things like<br>Precision farming and biotech we can<br>significantly reduce our Reliance on<br>harmful chemicals improve soil Health<br>enhance the nutritional value of our<br>food this means producing more with less<br>while minimizing our impact on the<br>planet the second category of<br>Innovations are those that can improve<br>methods for producing food a new wave of<br>food production is emerging shifting<br>from traditional Farms to controlled<br>environments like Laboratories and and<br>vertical farms and the third category<br>are those innovations that can reduce<br>waste so we've got mobile technologies<br>and digital marketplaces for example<br>that can help connect actors across the<br>food system to reduce losses with smart<br>pack packaging and food uh sensing<br>Technologies can help food stay fresh<br>for longer so many of these Innovations<br>combine several cross-cutting<br>Technologies if we take the vertical<br>farms for example these might combine<br>robotics artificial intelligence machine<br>learning Internet of Things synthetic<br>biology and<br>it all sounds pretty fancy<br>right but is all this Tech going to be<br>the savior of our system the Tech's hot<br>it's sexy it sizzles Tech often takes<br>center stage in our imaginations in our<br>discussions about the future of food<br>Tech Solutions promise a quick fix with<br>gadgets and apps Tech has the potential<br>for Rapid scaling reaching a large<br>number of people quickly this is<br>obviously really attractive to investors<br>and policy makers that seek widespread<br>impact and tech provides measurable<br>outcomes Tech Solutions often generate<br>data that allow for me easy measurement<br>of success this can be pretty reassuring<br>for those are funding the projects if we<br>compare this to social or human practice<br>type Innovations these arguably somewhat<br>similar in comparison social Innovations<br>often focus on changing behaviors and<br>cultural norms this is a slower process<br>it's hard to quantify or track with<br>metrics and they often require ongoing<br>investment to maintain momentum and<br>build community this can be less<br>appealing to those that are seeking a<br>one-time fix but although influencing<br>human behavior Can often be more complex<br>than dealing with technical aspects and<br>you may have heard of the the well-known<br>noan saying uh the Soft Stuff the<br>cultural behavioral stuff is the hard<br>stuff it is super important that we try<br>and innovate in this space as well so<br>what do we mean by social Innovations<br>fair trade Food Systems community<br>supported fisheries and food and<br>gleaning sharing initiatives are just<br>among some of the examples I've got here<br>on the slide which I've organized into<br>those same three Innovation same three<br>Innovation framework so the<br>possibilities for social Innovation are<br>constantly evolving by focusing on<br>building Community empowering<br>individuals and really importantly<br>fostering a culture of respect for food<br>these Innovations can help create a<br>sustainable and Equitable food system<br>for<br>all building the best possible future<br>food system will likely require<br>embracing many uh of both these<br>Technical and social type Innovations<br>and more and of course they can work<br>together right Tech can amplify social<br>Innovation if we imagine social<br>Innovations and consumption practices<br>for fresh produce where consumers choose<br>to eat on site hyperlocal food growing<br>in high tech closed loop systems and of<br>course there are challenges to<br>maximizing the potential and ensuring<br>the adoption of such Innovations and to<br>ensure the impact of these technologies<br>have on to ensure the impact that these<br>technologies have on our food system<br>will be positive we must ensure that<br>proper scientific research is conducted<br>so shortly I'm going to provide some<br>insights into some of the Innovations uh<br>that my team and I have worked across um<br>worked on over the course of my academic<br>career uh but before that I thought it<br>might be useful to provide a little bit<br>of context of who I am and where I've<br>come from uh so while I'm sort of time<br>Waring all over the show I'm going to<br>hop in the time capsu and and scoot back<br>to the beginning of my<br>journey here are the expected kid piics<br>um and there talks people of I feel like<br>people often have really interesting<br>stories about how surprising it is that<br>they ended up in Academia uh given<br>terrible report cards at school or<br>because no one else in their family has<br>ever been to University uh but I don't<br>have any of those stories uh although I<br>never would have guessed it at the time<br>the fact that I ended up in the<br>education sector isn't that surprising I<br>started practicing to be a teacher at a<br>very young age I would regularly round<br>up my brothers Nigel and Glenn who were<br>about two and four at the time uh and a<br>pile of soft toys uh to partake in<br>school lessons where I would teach them<br>to write and count uh the photo on the<br>top right of the slide here is from a<br>local newspaper uh me with a very<br>serious teacher-like expression and<br>already a pointer in<br>hand I grew up in an awesome family uh<br>with a really strong emphasis on<br>education my dad John who's sitting here<br>uh was the head of mass at uh Fielding<br>High School a position which my younger<br>brother now holds uh my mom Kay is a<br>physiotherapist at the paliston North<br>hospital and she provides Hands-On<br>educational training to many of our<br>University of Vago students who spend<br>their placements under her supervision<br>although I wasn't a top academic uh<br>student my report cards were always<br>pretty good and through high school I<br>enjoyed leadership in student politics<br>and I served as school president at both<br>my intermediate and uh and high school<br>once I finished high school I made the<br>decision to down south to aago and<br>settle in at Unico just as my mom had<br>done many years uh before me and started<br>studying towards becom I also stud<br>training to be a snowboard instructor so<br>after working all night at the Outback I<br>don't know how many of you remember the<br>Outback it was a a fairly Ruckus student<br>bar I would come to class on Friday and<br>then I would walk out to the southern<br>Highway and put my thumb out and HH a<br>ride to monik uh and I did this uh every<br>weekend over the season so after my<br>first year I decided to take time off my<br>studies and travel the world with my<br>snowboard<br>uh and I landed instructing jobs in<br>Canada and Switzerland and then back<br>home in methin I was convinced to come<br>back to study uh your second year when I<br>learned about a scholarship available<br>for students to go on Exchange to otaru<br>and subportal Japan as we've heard I<br>happened to know there was a lot of snow<br>uh well not on the mountain I studied<br>international business and Japanese and<br>I had an amazing year the highlight of<br>which was meeting uh my French boy<br>friend now husband Roman After Japan I<br>returned to den and started my third<br>year of study uh but but the mountains<br>call was too strong so I called my<br>parents to announce I was dropping out<br>of University to become a professional<br>snowboarder obviously they weren't<br>delighted with this decision but they<br>need not have worried because within<br>weeks I'd broken my neck uh and my<br>short-lived career as a professional<br>snowboarder on the mountain came to an<br>end uh nine months in a body brace meant<br>I had to move back home to the north<br>Ireland with my parents uh and so I<br>signed up for a suite of third-year<br>distance tourism papers after graduating<br>my marketing degree having managed to<br>skip pretty much all of the core<br>marketing papers I decided I'd better<br>give the discipline of Fe go so I did<br>come back down to denan uh to do my<br>honors year I also decided I'd better<br>learn French to speak to my boyfriend's<br>family so I enrolled in the ba and as<br>part of this degree ventured out on that<br>second student exchange we heard about<br>to Le on France denan beckoned again and<br>I found myself back at Uni this time<br>enrolled in a PhD and I spent a<br>fantastic 3 years doing all the things I<br>was told not to do in the orientation<br>seminar um getting married buying<br>renovating in a house uh and towards the<br>end uh having a baby for my doctoral<br>research I wor worked under the awesome<br>supervision of professors Rob Lawson and<br>ban wallcroft on a project looking at<br>ideological change in the context of a<br>consumer activist movement called slow<br>food movement slow food is a Glo Global<br>movement it's all about acting together<br>to ensure good clean and fair food<br>systems for all this sort of foray into<br>the wonderful world of food research<br>ignited what would become a lifelong<br>passion uh for sustainable Food Systems<br>after graduation I enjoyed working at<br>the center for sustainability as a<br>project manager for the energy cultures<br>project this was a Fab fabulous insight<br>into the strength of working in an<br>interdisciplinary uh Team um and and to<br>sort of help solve complex Wicked issues<br>my passion for researching food related<br>issues in an interdisciplinary team uh<br>meant that when the opportunity to<br>joined the food science department as a<br>lecturer came up I jumped at this chance<br>the role that was advertised was<br>consumer food scientist and though to be<br>honest I didn't quite know what this was<br>I applied and I got the job as time<br>progressed I started learning more about<br>the New Zealand food sector and my role<br>as an academic in this in a nutshell uh<br>this has been to Champion the importance<br>of Behavioral Science and driving<br>positive change in the sector more<br>specifically my research efforts have<br>focused on understanding how people make<br>food choices how they interact with food<br>systems and respond to new Technical and<br>social innovations that developed by my<br>clever colleagues and Industry Partners<br>this work program has involved<br>understanding user needs and behaviors<br>identifying barriers to Innovation<br>adoption and developing strategies to<br>address them including building using<br>trust and acceptance so what I want to<br>do now is to wiiz you through some of<br>this work in the next series of slides<br>I've organized the different strands<br>into those three innov uh Innovation<br>categories in the framework that I<br>introduced to you<br>earlier so I'm going to start off with<br>work that falls into this first category<br>innov ations or insights that increase<br>food quality and there are three sub<br>themes or strands to this<br>work the example papers on this slide<br>here approach the First theme<br>innovations that improve food and<br>farming from various angles we've done<br>lots of work looking at sort of<br>understanding the consumer and the top<br>four example papers on the slide explore<br>consumer preferences for local food<br>Fresh Products as well as<br>decision-making processes and behaviors<br>relating to food purchases by<br>understanding consumer preferences<br>research and Industry leaders can<br>develop solutions that improve food<br>quality and create a more efficient food<br>system the paper on the bottom left of<br>the side complements this consumer<br>focused approach by providing a broader<br>systemic perspective it highlights the<br>importance of considering all<br>stakeholders within the food system When<br>developing Innovations for lasting<br>improvements including the critical role<br>of indigenous knowledge and leadership<br>in fostering local sustainable Food<br>Systems as is discussed in the paper on<br>the bottom<br>right the provided papers here all<br>connect to the sub theme of Innovations<br>insights that improve food safety<br>Communications Assurance practices and<br>culture again much of the work here has<br>been on understanding consumer<br>perceptions given the importance of the<br>Chinese market which is where New<br>Zealand sends most of our food products<br>there's been a really strong emphasis on<br>these consumers the top three papers<br>examine how consumers perceive food<br>safety cues and information this<br>research helps identify how the industry<br>can tailor communication strategies to<br>effectively reach Target audiences<br>beyond the consumer Focus we've again<br>looked at the food uh risk communication<br>we've also looked at the food risk<br>communication competencies of the New<br>Zealand food industry as well as<br>examined how supplier audits which were<br>a really crucial part of the system<br>adapted during the covid-19 pandemic<br>combined This research contributes to<br>building a culture of food safety<br>through knowledge sharing and continuous<br>Improvement within the<br>industry these papers will connect to<br>the overarching theme of Innovations or<br>insights that use novel Technologies in<br>the F industry again most of these focus<br>on consumer acceptance and understanding<br>cultural nuances the studies explore how<br>consumers perceive and respond to novel<br>food processing Technologies such as<br>high pressure processing post electric<br>field and various foodborn bacteria<br>control methods This research helps<br>determine consumer preferences for these<br>Technologies and identify potential<br>strategies such as providing information<br>about the benefits and safety of Novel<br>Technologies to improve<br>acceptance F furthermore it's again<br>important to consider all stakeholders<br>so we also delve Beyond consumer<br>perspectives and perceptions and<br>attitude and to explore the perceptions<br>and attitudes of industry and Regulatory<br>bodies towards some of these novel<br>Technologies understanding these<br>viewpoints as crucial for Bridging the<br>Gap between technological advancements<br>and their successful implementation<br>within the food<br>industry I've been really fortunate to<br>have collaborated with some exceptional<br>colleagues and postgrads on this work a<br>few but uh by all no by no means all who<br>are pictured here uh specifically I want<br>to thank Professor Phil brimer um<br>although a microbiologist and a food<br>marketer uh make for a fairly<br>unconventional research Duo we've<br>enjoyed many productive research<br>collaborations uh not just in this<br>Innovation area but and some of the<br>others I'm going to get to um so thank<br>you<br>Phil the second Innovation category is<br>improving methods for producing and<br>promoting new foods and packaging<br>the papers here connect to the sub theme<br>of insect-based food Innovation so they<br>highlight the importance of<br>understanding consumer preferences<br>developing processing techniques to<br>enhance nutritional value and exploring<br>diverse applications for insect-based<br>Foods by addressing these aspects<br>researchers and food developers can<br>create insect-based food options that<br>are both appealing to Consumers and<br>offer a sustainable and nutritious food<br>source these papers will connect to the<br>sub theme of promo alternative proteins<br>and flexitarian diets the first couple<br>of papers explore consumer attitudes and<br>behaviors related to meat consumption of<br>flexitarianism understanding the<br>motivations and challenges and the<br>overalls at a flexitarian journey can<br>inform the development of products and<br>resources tailored to this growing<br>segment the second couple of papers<br>informed the development of strategies<br>to nudge consumers towards flexitarian<br>options the report at the bottom of the<br>slide explores the broader picture<br>analyzing the potential environmental<br>social and economic impacts of for New<br>Zealand of a more Diversified protein<br>Future these papers all emphasize the<br>importance of a consumer Centric<br>approach to developing high value<br>nutrition and functional foods by<br>understanding what motivates consumers<br>and what specific functionalities they<br>seek researchers and food developers can<br>create Innovative and successful<br>products in this growing Market<br>segment This research theme is all about<br>packaging Innovations and includes work<br>on Smart where active and intelligent<br>and recycled packaging from both a<br>consumer and Industry perspective Again<br>by understanding consumer preferences<br>for smart packaging functionalities and<br>addressing industry concerns Rec<br>regarding recycled materials researching<br>and food packaging developers can create<br>innovative solutions that are both<br>appealing to Consumers and support<br>sustainable Food<br>Systems again I've worked with countless<br>colleagues uh on and students in the<br>second Innovation category all who have<br>been a constant source of encouragement<br>and<br>inspiration the third and final category<br>includes Innovations in the food waste<br>space and there are three strands to<br>this<br>work taken together these Pap papers<br>provide a comprehensive picture of food<br>waste in New Zealand from measurement<br>and Source identification to potential<br>Solutions and their impacts we've<br>provided uh both a broad sort of<br>overview estimating food waste at the<br>national scale as well as provided data<br>about the scale and impact of waste at<br>specific food H points along the chain<br>so food loss on farms food and uh waste<br>and Retail and Food Service sectors for<br>example we've also examined social and<br>economic impacts of food Waste Solutions<br>including Behavior change CA campaigns<br>like the clean your plate campaign uh in<br>China as well as measured the impact of<br>food rescue<br>activities these papers are all about<br>social innovations that uh Target<br>people's behaviors attitudes and social<br>norms uh that contribute significantly<br>to food waste some of our work in this<br>space has looked at innovative ways to<br>encourage people to take doggy bags<br>order appropriate portions when ordering<br>food in store and online and accept ugly<br>imperfect produce other social<br>Innovations don't just focus on<br>influencing individual behaviors but<br>also address social changes within the<br>broader food system like the paper<br>looking at systemic and social dynamics<br>of food production which investigated<br>food waste in the kiwi fruit sector<br>other studies like the hospital ones<br>have addressed uh both indiv idual and<br>systemic factors influencing<br>waste these papers explore upcycled food<br>which technical Innovation gaining<br>Traction in the fight against food waste<br>so upcycled foods are made from<br>byproducts from our food manufacturing<br>industry or from parts of foods that<br>were s previously considered an edible<br>um our work here has focused on<br>investigating how these how upcycling<br>food can support the three pillars of<br>sustainability as well as contribute to<br>a healthy diet we've looked at the<br>market and re retail potential as well<br>as consumer acceptance of these new<br>types of<br>food a special thank you to all of these<br>exceptional colleagues and students with<br>whom I've collaborated with on these<br>food waste related projects uh and a<br>particular shout out to Professor Sheila<br>SK all of these people I guess their<br>encouragement and commitment have really<br>fueled my passion for research and<br>scholarship on waste and and more<br>broadly okay so that's the different<br>research domains and the people I've<br>worked with not all papers were shown<br>nor were all colleagues and students<br>acknowledged and for those that I've<br>missed I I<br>apologize and where this has only been a<br>really sort of quick whiz through uh of<br>my work rather than a you know a deeper<br>look at specific key findings however<br>given the breadth of the work uh and the<br>many different strands I've just<br>presented I thought what I would do<br>instead of talking about specific<br>findings is share some Reflections on my<br>attempt to be an impactful academic uh<br>and discuss some of the impact<br>so impact means many different things in<br>Academia typically uh impact is measured<br>by the research Publications like the<br>ones I've just shown you but the impact<br>that drives me is much more than that<br>it's about making real change to issues<br>that matter I think there's an increased<br>expectations for academics to<br>demonstrate what I've called sort of<br>beyond the textbook or beyond the<br>journal type types of impacts I don't<br>believe there's nearly enough support<br>provided by the academy to equip young<br>scholars here so to finish my talk<br>tonight I thought I would share some of<br>what I've learned in the hope that this<br>might assist others who want to embrace<br>an impact path I'm specifically going to<br>focus on connecting science policy<br>Society to enact change I try to build<br>various forms of impact into all the<br>different strands of work that I do but<br>where I feel I've been most able to sort<br>of be most impactful to date has been<br>with my food loss and waste work so I'm<br>going to focus on sharing a couple of<br>experiences in this<br>domain I just want to take a couple of<br>minutes to set the scene these these are<br>some of the government initiatives uh<br>relating to food loss and waste in New<br>Zealand Ministry for the environment is<br>the main central government agency<br>involved in this work uh food food waste<br>falls under its mandate from both a<br>waste minimization and management<br>perspective as well as from an emissions<br>reduction perspective and there's a<br>whole Suite of other agencies and<br>territorial authorities involved as well<br>and of course this action at the<br>domestic level uh sits within uh the<br>context of intergovernmental and<br>Multinational initiatives that New<br>Zealand contributes to as well all of<br>this means as researchers working in<br>this domain our networks need to be<br>really wide so I'm going to run through<br>these sort of three strategies which<br>I've used to leverage my research<br>expertise to influence some of the<br>government policies and initiatives<br>you've seen on the previous<br>Slide the first strategy is evidencing<br>uh sorry is influencing policy through<br>evidence-based advocacy in essence this<br>is all about using the power of<br>knowledge to to um to drive positive<br>change in society the example here uh as<br>we've heard from uh Professor Barker I<br>was asked in 2019 2020 to serve as the<br>independent advisor to an environment<br>committee food waste briefing uh and I<br>produced the report uh named by the<br>committee as the murisa report that<br>summarized evidence on the size and<br>scope of New Zealand's food waste<br>problem and made recommendations on what<br>could be done to address this my<br>recommendations included that New<br>Zealand adopt a Target measure act uh<br>food waste strategy initially cabinet<br>agreed to only endorse the target<br>measurement stages of this approach<br>which were to establish a national<br>definition and to conduct a baseline<br>audit of food waste across the supply<br>chain both of uh which are now in place<br>the fact that the whole series of<br>recommendations there were lots of them<br>were about 38 recommendations on action<br>uh on some terms of sort of action how<br>to action food waste prevention and<br>reduction weren't endorsed in full<br>immediately was really frustrating uh<br>but actually many of the many of these<br>actions have since come to fruition and<br>I've and have appeared in that summary<br>table I showed on the previous slide uh<br>government agencies work programs picked<br>up some of these actions Ministry for<br>the environment for example have since<br>funded uh Behavior reduction programs<br>for consumers and businesses as<br>recommended our University of atago team<br>is currently working on on a research<br>project to looking at Food waste in the<br>Aged care sector as part of this<br>Behavior change program but other<br>non-government uh stakeholders also<br>picked up some of these recommendations<br>and made them work here at the<br>University of atago we didn't wait for<br>the government we just went ahead in<br>established a dedicated food waste<br>research theme or Center called food<br>waste Innovations that's been running<br>for about four years now an organization<br>that facilitates collaboration among<br>many food waste sector stakeholders<br>called New Zealand food waste Champions<br>was formed by Community Players with<br>representatives from across the supply<br>chain so in some although not sort of<br>all immediately many of the<br>recommendations did see light uh in<br>serving as advisor to a briefing process<br>proved to be a fantastic opportunity to<br>help shape the national agenda on waste<br>while obviously many of my experiences<br>here are specific I think there are some<br>broader lessons to be learned I've<br>identif identified three key takeaways<br>uh for researchers seeking to influence<br>through evidence-based<br>advocacy first of all is the first one<br>is is be propositional I think as<br>researchers we often stop short of<br>making recommendations we tend to just<br>want to present uh the research facts<br>and sort of hand it over with to others<br>to do with what um to do with um as they<br>see fit uh but I encourage you when<br>appropriate to be brave and don't just<br>sort of outline the problem but make<br>recommendations on what should happen<br>the second uh takeaway is policy change<br>takes time and persistence and long-term<br>engagement are needed I've been working<br>in this space for over 10 years and the<br>policy Wheels have really only started<br>moving on this issue in the last four or<br>so and thirdly while policy makers might<br>be the target audience uh be open to the<br>idea that other non-governmental<br>stakeholders might end up finding ways<br>to action your policy recommendations<br>the second impact strategy I wanted to<br>discuss is influencing policy through<br>building relationships and networks and<br>becoming a trusted Source in the Foodway<br>space I worked to establish a reputation<br>as a sort of a go-to subject matter<br>expert I made myself widely know and I<br>built a researcher brand and I I I<br>networked hard and then the policy<br>influencing opportunities did follow and<br>i' I've put a few of the examples up on<br>the slides on the slide of the<br>opportunities I've had to contribute to<br>some of the intergovernmental work<br>programs um that New Zealand partakes in<br>this space so I've got two key takeaways<br>here for researchers seeking to make a<br>policy impact I think building<br>relationships is absolutely key<br>prioritize conferences and events with<br>government industry and NGO attendance<br>in fact I've often prioritized these<br>types of events over the academic ones<br>the second is that it sounds really<br>obvious it's super important so I've put<br>it up anyway become a trusted Source<br>constantly deliver high quality research<br>uh services on time and their time uh<br>and demonstrate that willingness to uh<br>provide ongoing support and<br>expertise the third strategy is all<br>about communication and collaboration to<br>amplify research impact the example I<br>wanted to give here was how we helped<br>not only sort of create a research<br>movement but also a public advocacy<br>movement essentially a movement can<br>translate Research into action by<br>creating a groundw support a ground<br>swell of support for change in terms of<br>research coalitions or sort of research<br>movements I've already mentioned our<br>food waste Innovation research theme uh<br>and we've had a really strong Focus not<br>just on creating new knowledge uh but<br>raising also raising public and policy<br>awareness about our research findings<br>and we've done this in lots of different<br>ways uh We've made sort of digestible<br>resources so website has a resource Hub<br>where we've put up talking abstracts of<br>our of our Journal articles as well as<br>videos and infographics and we send out<br>stakeholder newsletters and host lots of<br>public uh events regarding non-research<br>Partnerships we collaborate closely with<br>other stakeholders industry NOS to build<br>this broader Coalition for change on<br>this issue so the key message I want to<br>share here is that sort of creating<br>movements has helped enormously amplify<br>our research efforts I spent lots of<br>time on non-typical academic activities<br>I chair the board of the New Zealand<br>food waste Champions 12.3 trust for<br>example but I find it time really well<br>spent and so I encourage other<br>researchers to think about what they<br>might do in spaces where they wish to<br>make an<br>impact okay so that's the three<br>strategies I found to be impactful so<br>use evidence-based advocacy to help set<br>the agenda build networks and become a<br>trusted source and collaborate and<br>communicate I feel really lucky to have<br>been offered the opportunities I've had<br>to help make an impact on the national<br>food waste agenda uh and we've made some<br>really terrific progress um on many<br>fronts but there's still a lot of work<br>to do and I look forward to cont<br>continuing to contribute to work uh in<br>the space where I<br>can I strongly encourage emerging<br>researchers to think about what how they<br>can best be impactful in their research<br>domains and although I'm by no means a<br>research uh impact expert I'm always<br>happy to have a coffee and and talk<br>about my own uh impact experiences and<br>what I've learned so if anyone's can<br>just just reach<br>out okay All That Remains now is to sort<br>of wrap up some more<br>souls regarding my next steps I've got<br>lots on my plate with head of Department<br>duties which involve in Shing our ataro<br>food and egg programs Thrive I want to<br>thank all of my colleagues in food<br>science uh and particularly uh associate<br>professor Graham is uh who takes on the<br>extra responsibility of acting head uh<br>when<br>necessary there also continues to be<br>lots happening on the food waste front<br>with the office of the prime minister's<br>Chief science advisor just recently<br>releasing a new series of<br>recommendations to government our<br>research team as well as the New Zealand<br>food waste Champions are committed to<br>working collaboratively with the food<br>sector to translate as many of these<br>recommendations into action as possible<br>I'm blown by Blown Away by the caliber<br>of people we have on the team and I want<br>to give a special thanks uh special<br>shout of thanks to Caitlyn Dawson and<br>her team Deborah Manning Dame Juliet<br>Gerard and the rest of my board Tessa<br>Vincent and all of the<br>Champions to ensure I'm as impactful as<br>possible in my research and service<br>leadership roles I've prioritized up<br>Skilling and Leadership and governance<br>uh in a partway through a program of<br>courses run by the New Zealand Institute<br>of directors and I'm really grateful for<br>this opportunity and for the informal<br>leadership mentoring uh Professor<br>Richard Barker and Chancellor Trish<br>Oakley kindly<br>provide although I dreaded the thought<br>of standing here tonight um before you<br>all actually preparing this lecture has<br>been pretty rewarding um looking back at<br>my career I'm feel super proud about<br>about many things um I'm proud I hit<br>Prof by 40 uh but I'm most proud I've<br>managed to do this uh while raising<br>three amazing kids who are sitting here<br>tonight Luka Mato and Cammy all who<br>amaze me daily uh and this wouldn't have<br>been possible without the loving support<br>of my wonderful husband Roman uh and my<br>mom and dad who I admire and appreciate<br>immensely bringing it back to food let's<br>break bread on a delicious solution a<br>sustainable food system it's a recipe<br>requiring a whole range of innov<br>ingredients Technical and social<br>Solutions and a generous helping of<br>collaboration science policy and Society<br>need to sit at the table to together to<br>ensure that food is valued not wasted k<br>tenar<br>Co Professor Marosa on behalf of<br>everyone gathered here tonight and the<br>people viewing this presentation now and<br>in the year<br>2050 I'd like to sincerely thank you for<br>sharing your research journey and aely<br>demonstrating the positive impact that a<br>passionate and dedicated science<br>scientists can make towards improving<br>the safety and wellbeing of our<br>community and ensuring the<br>sustainability of our food<br>systems for many years I've been very<br>pleased of myself for the role I played<br>as HD in appointing Miranda as a<br>lecturer in the department of Food<br>Science this appointment was not made<br>because of Miranda's Stella publication<br>record rather it was as was evident<br>tonight it was her enthusiasm and her<br>desire for her research to make a<br>meaningful difference that swayed the<br>panel thank you Miranda for also sharing<br>some of the secrets to your success the<br>importance of building scientific<br>credibility and Trust of having the<br>determination to stick with a problem<br>over time of developing relationships<br>and connections and of using science<br>science-based efficacy to enact real<br>change on behalf of all of us here<br>tonight I thank you for the very<br>positive impact your research is having<br>thank you<br>to invite Professor Mara back to the<br>stage to receive a small token of<br>appreciation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
