with a Bachelor of Arts and<br>Science in politics and chemistry before<br>stepping into his role leading one of<br>the largest student associations in the<br>country however he was no stranger to<br>leadership roles during his time as a<br>student he served as president of both<br>the mathematics and physics Students<br>Association and the atago chemistry<br>Students<br>Association he also worked as a news<br>reporter for student radio station radio<br>one and wrote stories for critic T arohi<br>covering student<br>politics throughout this year quinton's<br>been an outstanding advocate for<br>students and has worked closely<br>alongside other university council<br>members as the student representative<br>and with the senior leadership team he's<br>been a vital voice for students in

to tap as public opportunity to<br>wish you Quinton all the best with your<br>future<br>endeavors<br>Quinton please join me in welcoming<br>gwendon to deliver the graduation<br>Jan I'm Quinton Jane and it is my<br>absolute privilege to speak to everyone<br>here today as a part of this graduation<br>ceremony and I just want to extend a<br>huge congratulations to all the<br>graduates here<br>today writing this speech was not easy<br>for some context this is the 10th<br>graduation I've attended this year in my<br>role as the 2023 ousa president and I'm<br>the only person who spoke this year<br>who's at the start of their career and<br>professional Journey rather than in the<br>middle or towards the end everyone else<br>who came up here took to the podium and<br>spoke about all the things that they'd<br>learned through their lives how they got<br>to these amazing positions they'd been<br>in and they passed on some Sage advice<br>and profound Reflections but I can't do<br>that I'm 23 if I was to talk about what<br>I was doing 20 years ago it was probably<br>cutting my own hair at preschool much<br>mom's<br>disgust but what I've taken from these<br>other speeches is that there's no one<br>way to success instead everyone's<br>Futures have been shaped by the<br>Landscapes around them which in turn<br>they've helped to shape so today I want<br>to focus on the future our future and<br>what our future as young people who've<br>just recently graduated from the<br>University of Oto holds for us sometimes<br>this isn't what we want to think about<br>with the threat of climate change the<br>idea of maybe never owning a home or the<br>thought of another pandemic looming over<br>us as we go into the future it's<br>daunting it's scary but when I think<br>about how we've persevered through the<br>last few years I know the future isn't<br>that<br>BL every single graduate here today had<br>to study through the worst parts of the<br>pandemic either at high school or at<br>University which was no easy feat we had<br>to transition to online learning social<br>distancing maske wearing exams becoming<br>assessments and worst of all Zoom<br>breakout rooms for some this time was<br>even harder having to balance the<br>responsibilities as an essential worker<br>or manage a disability in a very<br>uncertain<br>environment this was a hard time to be a<br>student and yet you got through it and<br>are here graduating today that is<br>something to be proud<br>of I remember going home during that<br>first lockdown to my parents house<br>barely a month after moving into my<br>first flat on George Street the lockdown<br>was announced on a Monday afternoon and<br>by that evening my flatmates and I were<br>on the road back to<br>Utah studying at home wasn't easy my<br>parents Wi-Fi was not designed to have<br>my two sisters my mom and me all trying<br>to work from home and it was near<br>impossible to actually watch my lectures<br>live we had a spare room at home which<br>I'd hoped to turn into a bit of a home<br>office just to get out of my room<br>sometimes and this worked great for<br>about 3 days until both my sisters<br>decided to join me and did their utmost<br>to distract me and I know everyone here<br>today has similar stories of studying<br>throughout the pandemic on their own<br>every graduate here has shown that by<br>getting through this they are going to<br>be a part of a resilient future that<br>they will be graduates who can confront<br>challenges headon face adversity and<br>come out stronger for it on the other<br>side so when I think about these<br>challenges that the future holds I know<br>that we're going to be the ones who can<br>tackle them and get on with it this year<br>I have had the absolute privilege of<br>leading US USA the otago university<br>Students Association this job has tested<br>me in every sense and required a lot of<br>learning but it's also been the best job<br>I've ever had one of the best parts<br>about this role has been working with so<br>many different students here at otago<br>and across the country but in particular<br>seeing how much the student Community<br>here at otago cares about and supports<br>one another I've seen a number of<br>student groups rally together to stand<br>up for themselves and support the<br>university despite all the challenges of<br>the past few years and the desire to get<br>on with life as normal we as a student<br>Community have continued to show the<br>spirit for which otaga is well known<br>I've seen students protest in support of<br>their University put on cultural<br>showcases thunderz for those affected by<br>Cyclone Gabriel and clean up the streets<br>of North dedan and so much more as USA<br>president I've also spent the year as<br>the student representative on the<br>University Council and participated in<br>consultations across every level of the<br>University I've also met and spoken with<br>all my counterparts across the country<br>who do this at every other university in<br>alador and nowhere else in the country<br>do the student Community plays such a<br>large role in the operations and culture<br>of their universities and this student<br>culture at the University of Oto that is<br>incredibly unique and special and<br>something I know I'll look back on<br>fondly our place is special you can<br>locate a flat you're looking for not by<br>knowing the address but by knowing which<br>named flat it's next door to and I can't<br>think of anywhere else in the world<br>where students live together in one area<br>of the city quite like we do in north<br>deden and of course nowhere else in the<br>world has the hi High Street party it's<br>this culture and this shared space that<br>makes denan a real community<br>and thinking about that Community<br>element I'm drawn to when I first came<br>down to dened in<br>2019 I was driving down with my mom the<br>evening before moving into ad College<br>where just south of muui I encountered a<br>car overtaking somewhere they shouldn't<br>be which crashed into me head on I<br>arrived in oty in one of those noisy<br>Rescue helicopters and a lovely lady<br>called be brought all my stuff to Denon<br>for me the next day after collecting it<br>out of my now wed car the student<br>community in Denon was so supportive as<br>soon as I arrived one of the people in<br>the car just behind me was also a first<br>year otago student moving down to Stam<br>and they came to check on me a couple of<br>days later at adet my floor mates helped<br>me to unpack to reti my sling for my<br>broken collar bone and made sure I was<br>included even though I was a bit shaken<br>and couldn't really participate in the O<br>week activities I'm so incredibly<br>grateful for all the support that I<br>received because without it I don't<br>think I would have got through that<br>first year and that's the great thing<br>about otago kindness and support are the<br>norm here this support for one another<br>is something that I've seen every day on<br>campus and it's what makes the student<br>Community here so special so to everyone<br>graduating today good luck all the best<br>and Well Done remember where you've come<br>from the resilience that you've<br>demonstrated to get to this point and<br>the people and Community who have helped<br>you along the way the future is exciting<br>and we have the power to change it norda<br>Teno<br>Teno thank<br>you<br>thank you very much Quinton for speaking<br>to us today um at
