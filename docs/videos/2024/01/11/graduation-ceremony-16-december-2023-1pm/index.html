CEOs and<br>emerging Leaders with new zealand-based<br>businesses working within Asia being a<br>woman in law has also driven her to<br>spend time cheering Global women a not<br>for-profit organization which connects<br>emerging Leaders with top women leaders<br>in the not for-profit private and public<br>sectors this theme of incredibly high<br>levels of achievement is consistent<br>throughout May's academic and profession<br>life in 1987 she was a recipient of the<br>Frank Knox Memorial Fellowship which<br>enabled her to study for a master of<br>laws at Harvard Law

Society<br>president frasa Barton about Dr Chen's<br>incredible passion and drive that has<br>seen her tackle significant adversity<br>and succeed at the highest level to<br>become one of the country's leading<br>legal<br>Minds I'm sure that those of you who are<br>graduating in law have been fortunate<br>enough to reference Dr Chen's essential<br>textbooks on your academic Journey<br>including her 1100 page Public Law<br>toolbox guide that was referred to by<br>the former prime minister Jenny Shipley<br>as a gift to the<br>nation Dr Chen is truly an inspiration<br>and her list of achievements shows no<br>signs of<br>slowing I'm confident then when she<br>delivers her graduation speech her words<br>of wisdom will resonate<br>with all our graduates<br>today at atago we're extremely proud to<br>count Dr Chan as one of our alumni and I<br>offer her her heartfelt my heartfelt<br>congratulations on receiving your honory<br>uh doctor of laws no to Dr<br>Chen please join me in welcoming Dr Chen<br>of<br>now of course I've just acknowledged the<br>judges first because that's what I'm<br>used to doing I also acknowledge the<br>lawyer which are the lawyers but of<br>course to the rest of you you are<br>all to the gradu but of course to the<br>supporters<br>I'm explaining to you that this Tong<br>that I am wearing is a gift to me it is<br>a gift to me from The kangara National<br>Trust board when I acted for them in an<br>urgent claim before the wangi tribunal<br>and it has my name my Mari name engraved<br>in Gold it is a name that is gifted to<br>me by Sir Timothy KATU and Professor fya<br>Milroy and the Tonga means a a great<br>deal to me to hiapo if I say it right<br>means sharp<br>mind and uh so if I can complete by<br>saying no Taiwan Toano no<br>Teno and can I acknowledge uh thank you<br>to the uh the<br>chancellor can I also thank Fraser<br>Barton for his very kind words of<br>citation but of course to Professor<br>Shelly griffus and Emeritus professor<br>John Dawson they were the ones who put<br>my name up and I am grateful to them to<br>my husband Dr John Sinclair and to my<br>son Jack Chen Sinclair no pressure Jack<br>but both your parents now have<br>doctorates from the University of<br>otago so you decide what you want to do<br>but we've just given you a little bit of<br>guidance can I just say that I also want<br>to acknowledge my mother who is here my<br>father who cannot be here today CU he is<br>not well and to my sisters I've got<br>Mindy here I've got Angel here here an<br>he can't be here because my wonderful<br>niece Esther is about to give birth and<br>we thought that we shouldn't make this<br>day any more special for you than having<br>a live birth on stage so she is not able<br>to be here but I had forgotten how<br>fabulous it is to be on<br>stage I have looked at the face of every<br>graduent The Joy the pride in themselves<br>the sense of satis action that they have<br>completed a long and difficult and<br>arduous journey and the bursting of<br>Pride of the parents the family the<br>friends that are here the cultural pride<br>and the Expressions we've had with a<br>hucker and the the songs in Pacifica<br>it's been amazing and I'm saying to the<br>graduants<br>today don't ever forget this feeling<br>sear it in your soul remember it and<br>remember how it feels because I am here<br>to tell you today that when you all<br>walked across today I looked at the<br>large array of very pretty and very<br>uncomfortable shoewear um and that was<br>just the<br>men and I thought to myself how many of<br>these will<br>be ranga in our society how many will be<br>Nobel Prize winners how many will go on<br>to be the good and the great in our<br>country<br>of Alo New Zealand and my message to you<br>is that you will never achieve it if you<br>ever expect to have the<br>Applause and the<br>Gratitude and the warmth and the<br>encouragement and the support that you<br>got and are getting today the reason is<br>because the most important thing that I<br>have had to inculcate in my life is that<br>if if nobody else will support me if<br>nobody else thinks it's a good idea if<br>nobody else will uh Champion me or help<br>me if I have a unique Viewpoint and I<br>think that there's a gap and I think it<br>needs to be done then I need to be brave<br>enough to do<br>it recently I was fortunate enough to be<br>in Vienna it is my favorite city in the<br>world well actually it used to be<br>Jerusalem but it's a little difficult at<br>the moment with Jerusalem so it is<br>Vienna it's the home of the Arts<br>politics culture music religion and we<br>went to all the great art galleries and<br>we saw I saw the different perspectives<br>of the great artists of the world do you<br>know that when Peter bral<br>painted it was revolutionary in his day<br>because he thought it was worthwhile<br>painting ordinary scenes of peasant life<br>that was Radical in his day but of<br>course he's GI that to us and we don't<br>think anything of it when he painted<br>Paul on the road to Damascus I couldn't<br>actually find Paul in his painting it's<br>like where's Wally I was thinking<br>where's Paul but but you know his unique<br>Viewpoint was that he painted everything<br>going on and then it just happened to be<br>that you know the subject matter was<br>somewhere in the middle of that what I'm<br>saying to you is that each one of you<br>has a unique Viewpoint and<br>vision and you may end up being rich and<br>famous in your lifetime for doing it but<br>remember van goof<br>died in<br>poverty he died never having sold a<br>painting he died with everyone thinking<br>he was mad and he died with only one<br>ear and yet we were without him today we<br>would not have what we are told as the<br>great greatest impressionist artist in<br>the world that's what we're told today<br>go to any gallery go to any gift shop<br>you will see his paintings the starry<br>night and all of his other great art on<br>the backs of mugs on cushions you know<br>he never saw it he never saw it<br>now if vanov had allowed poverty and<br>adversity to get in the way of his<br>vision as I suspect many of us would<br>have we would never see sunflowers or a<br>starring night with the intensity and<br>depth of the unique he created and he<br>left for us and it's a same if he'd<br>given in and this is really important to<br>the<br>temptation to use his talent to paint<br>conventional subjects in conventional<br>ways oh you don't like Star night like<br>this you don't like sunflowers like this<br>okay well maybe I could paint watery<br>Landscapes of wanica and sell them we<br>are fortunate that he didn't do that<br>because it would have made him a good<br>living maybe some Fame in his time uh<br>but we'd never have had what we have now<br>so so how do you know what is your<br>unique<br>Viewpoint now that is shaped by your<br>journey and experiences no one else has<br>had that's why I told you about my Tong<br>I am the result of a 30-year career in<br>the law but I'm also result of my<br>background uh last night I was fortunate<br>enough to have some of my old<br>schoolmates around one had been to<br>primary school with me and she said I<br>used to sit next to you you don't<br>remember I didn't remember she said you<br>used to draw pictures cuz you didn't<br>speak English and I it seemed like a<br>lifetime ago to me but you see I was a<br>Chinese woman and we came to New Zealand<br>poor and we didn't speak English because<br>my dad was here to train the New Zealand<br>gymnastics team and he was an Olympics<br>gymnastics coach and my mom was an elite<br>athlete and they met on the track and as<br>a consequence they raised us<br>differently uh I say that because we<br>grew up in a gymnasium we were all swim<br>champions in Taiwan and as a consequence<br>I fit none of the conventional<br>stereotypes of my gender nor ethnicity<br>now I'm a Chinese woman if you didn't<br>know me and you looked at me you'd think<br>oh she's not leadership material she's s<br>self effacing she's a supportive person<br>she's probably really good at math and<br>she's probably a very bad<br>driver let me tell you amongst those<br>stereotypes the only one of them that is<br>true is that I'm a truly B<br>driver I met my my brother-in-law uh<br>last night uh and he was the one who<br>taught me to drive and he recounted he<br>Rising stories to my son who's just got<br>his driver's license about the fact that<br>he's lucky to be alive cuz he taught me<br>to drive um but what I'm trying to say<br>to you is that I for example I'm very<br>sporty okay now uh I did meet a woman<br>who was Chinese and she looked ripped<br>and I said to her you're the only<br>Chinese person I know that is ripped and<br>she said wow that's saying something<br>because there are billions of Chinese<br>people it is true uh so the greatest<br>hardship for me in being a lawyer is<br>that I have to sit still for long<br>periods of<br>time I am leadership material I am not<br>support crew I have to say that when the<br>the dean of law at Victoria University<br>brought the right honorable Professor<br>Sir Jeffrey Palmer to my office to tell<br>me that he was going to share the<br>teaching of public law which was my<br>course with me uh after he finished<br>being prime minister the first thing I<br>said to Sir Jeffrey was mate I want to<br>be you and you are amazing but I'm no<br>one's Girl Friday and you will do your<br>own<br>admin uh so so Chim P was a great<br>success for except for the fact that<br>neither of us were Indians both of us<br>were Chiefs and I feel very sorry for<br>the staff Jeffrey and I always knew what<br>we were doing but nobody else uh so uh<br>my my my gift<br>is that I see things other people don't<br>see and I I do things first I'm a<br>Pioneer a profit in my own town let me<br>tell you it's not the gift I wanted it's<br>got a lot of downs because usually when<br>you say to someone I think we need to do<br>this they say you're nuts and uh for<br>example when I decided to leave<br>Academia uh my parents were very keen<br>for me to be the youngest law professor<br>in New Zealand um my dad didn't speak to<br>uh Sir Jeffrey Palmer for two years<br>actually after we set up Chen Palmer uh<br>I went into private practice and then we<br>set up the law firm uh because because<br>actually they wanted me to stay in<br>Academia also when I when I went to<br>ockland to set up the super divis<br>Institute because I saw a gap and the<br>importance of understanding that<br>actually New Zealand had<br>transformed and that by 2040 when we<br>have the 200th anniversary of Titi or<br>white half the population is going to be<br>Mari Asian and Pacifica and that really<br>had profound implications for all manner<br>of not just the law but also of every<br>aspect of society everyone said to me<br>that that was a dumb idea as well and<br>that actually as a public lawyer I<br>couldn't go to Orland while I did I went<br>so what I'm trying to say to you is that<br>it is that Journey that has shaped my<br>unique perspective it's allowed me to do<br>the things I've done I've also just<br>realized something through writing the<br>speech that I've never understood we<br>just did a survey of Asian lawyers<br>Fraser was kind enough to come to the<br>seminar that we had some of the asent<br>lawyers said they've never experienced<br>any discrimination I've never understood<br>that why some have and why some haven't<br>I Now understand that the closer you are<br>to The Stereotype the less<br>discrimination you suffer but if you're<br>really really different from The<br>Stereotype you get the bash so uh are<br>you brave enough I'm asking you are you<br>brave enough to contribute your unique<br>Viewpoint uh the the<br>problem is that there are some things<br>and this is a really really important<br>thing this is this is taken me my entire<br>life to learn so I'm going to give it to<br>you right now on a plate there are some<br>things you must do because of who you<br>are in the journey you have had look I<br>didn't want to set up New Zealand Asian<br>lawyers but nobody else was doing it it<br>was clear that there was a gap 12% of<br>the legal profession are now Asian 45%<br>of them are 7 years pqe<br>post-qualification admission experience<br>and less there was a need uh and so I<br>ended up having to do that because I had<br>to do it because of the journey that<br>I've been on but the Revelation that I<br>really want to share with you today is<br>this that there are also some things<br>that you could<br>do but you were never meant to do I'm<br>just going to say that again there are<br>some things that you could do but you<br>were never meant to do them<br>and the trick is to figure out which is<br>which and not just move with a herd<br>doing things you are not never meant to<br>do wastes time it means that you may<br>never do the things that you are meant<br>to do as a consequence because you<br>distracting yourself you're off on some<br>tangent somewhere walking down a road I<br>mean you can do it you just weren't<br>meant to do it somebody else can do it<br>and you're wasting your time uh the<br>result of that well you might be a bit<br>dissatisfied and you might die failure<br>but you know feel free um look I I took<br>a rather hit and miss approach uh when I<br>left and graduated from this<br>University how else could I have done it<br>I was young I didn't know anything as<br>Robbie Williams sees in his song<br>eternity youth is wasted on the young<br>before you know it it's come and<br>gone that that's that's my way of<br>explaining why I'm trying to get ripped<br>if I don't do it now it isn't going to<br>be happening all right uh so look I was<br>super busy people asked me to do things<br>I said sure uh now that's fine to a<br>point but time spent doing must not<br>replace time spent thinking time spent<br>reflecting time spent understanding what<br>you are really good at and what you have<br>a unique Viewpoint about that no one<br>else has what can you do that no one<br>else can do because if other people are<br>doing it why do you why are you doing it<br>um remember you can't be busy and<br>excellent I just going to say that again<br>because people say oh I'm so busy people<br>ask me oh you must be so busy I said no<br>I'm not busy I am not busy because I I<br>am doing what I should be doing uh you<br>can't be busy and excellent Excellence<br>takes time learn to say<br>no also remember that everything<br>everything costs something even the good<br>good things and everything takes time I<br>now wish some of you will laugh at this<br>I now wish I had pleased fewer people<br>pleasing people creates detours and<br>deviations on your route to doing what<br>you should have been doing it it for me<br>it ate up valuable time you really only<br>need to seek permission from yourself<br>otherwise you'll be waiting for others<br>to lift a roadblock when you're on the<br>wrong road you shouldn't be on that<br>route get off it so I end with my three<br>secrets of success first don't wait Dr<br>Zeus writes about the waiting place in<br>his book oh the Places you will go some<br>of you will have read it to your<br>children when when when they were young<br>uh but you know it's it's a book about<br>life uh let me quote some of it everyone<br>is just waiting waiting around for a yes<br>or no waiting for the fish to bite<br>waiting for a better break waiting for<br>another chance everyone is waiting you<br>need to stop waiting I've gotten really<br>good at generating my own waves and<br>surfing them I can't wait forever I've<br>got to do that because I'm going to die<br>and I'm in the second half of my life so<br>I have to get on with it all right you<br>are the sum of what you do in your life<br>as I said you've got the same amount of<br>time as Nobel Prize winners but few of<br>us become Nobel Prize winners we're all<br>flawed but being brilliant and a little<br>bit efficient is a combination that's<br>quite common amongst the biographies of<br>people who make a difference look it's<br>never going to be perfect the imperfect<br>life is all we have when one storm<br>finishes there's going to be another<br>storm it's just a different storm okay<br>but history makes itself every day like<br>a pencil what Mark will you leave what<br>Echoes will remain after you are done<br>and you are<br>gone remember<br>the success of today is huge but Success<br>is Not<br>final but more importantly failure is<br>not fatal you will stuff up sometimes we<br>do it big time but let me tell you it is<br>not fatal you can still get up again and<br>you can still move on you know there was<br>there's a there's been a recent movie by<br>Michelle yo it's wonderful uh you know<br>she's 60 plus and she's just got her<br>first Oscar it's called everything<br>everywhere all at once uh I didn't<br>actually understand it the first time<br>but there's a Multiverse and it's a cool<br>Multiverse because you know she gets to<br>endless repeat plays at the game of a<br>life therefore she can be many different<br>people she can do many different walks<br>of life and some she's doing dishes and<br>some she's doing taxes and some she's<br>got different career choices with<br>different people in different ways or<br>not at all look it's a great movie but<br>most importantly remember it's a movie<br>you can't do it all you will have to<br>make a choice which means you can do<br>some things not others non- making a<br>choice is making a choice so don't fool<br>yourself<br>secondly such an important lesson in<br>success you have to want to<br>succeed Havard taught me that if you<br>don't want it you won't get it sometimes<br>even if you really want it you don't get<br>it but wanting is a prerequisite to<br>succeeding because that's what motivates<br>the success that is invariably needed to<br>succeed what I'm trying to tell you<br>today is that if you are motivated by<br>the the Roar of the crowd by people<br>patting you on the back and telling you<br>yeah yeah we agree with you yeah yeah<br>that's conventional yeah yeah we think<br>you should do that then you will not<br>achieve your unique perspective remember<br>it's Unique because no one else has had<br>it if they'd had it they'd say yeah I<br>think that's a great idea it's Unique<br>because no one's had it and as a<br>consequence of that you have to learn to<br>do it even when everyone thinks it's a<br>dumb idea I'm not saying that you don't<br>ask other people I'm just saying to you<br>that if that is what motivates you you<br>won't make it certainly for me I would<br>never have made it um most people have<br>told me throughout my career that what I<br>have done was a dumb thing to do I<br>actually applied for a scholarship to<br>write Public Law toolbox and the<br>scholarship Committee of emminent<br>persons in the law turned me down they<br>said that they didn't think it was a<br>good idea I wrote it anyway I wrote it<br>anyway after I'd given birth to a child<br>and I<br>was I was I was trying to be the<br>managing partner of chimp Pama I did it<br>at nights and weekends it was far too<br>long and then I did another addition<br>because I'm stupid and I didn't learn<br>the first time that actually you can't<br>write when you're working full-time and<br>you're a mother um so all I'm trying to<br>say to you is that uh there's a Chinese<br>proverb The Peasant must stand on a<br>hillside with his mouth open for a very<br>long time before a roast duck flies in<br>all<br>right it isn't going to happen guys you<br>you have to make it for yourself you<br>have to want it and but can I also<br>advise you something that uh that<br>someone has helped me a lot with don't<br>create a life you want to run away from<br>the superpower that you have that makes<br>you formidable the superpower that<br>allowed you to finish your degrees to<br>have the grit and the courage to do it<br>is also a power that can break you if<br>you're not careful it exhausts other<br>people it'll exhaust you sometimes<br>people say to me May you're a bit<br>exhausting that's my son um sometimes<br>I'm a bit exhausting to myself so<br>sabatical are a good idea all right uh<br>third you've got to be the most<br>important person in your life you have<br>to because uh you know if you if you<br>want to paint like van and not do<br>conventional other people might not<br>think it's a good idea it's something<br>I've really had to struggle with because<br>you know I I would have wished for<br>different gifts and I would have wished<br>for something more popular you know<br>maybe come back as Taylor Swift or<br>something you know she's she's Time<br>person of the year you know just edging<br>out Barbie and King Charles III but no<br>that has not been my gift so I will not<br>be shimmying or singing to you today so<br>look you're the person youve been the<br>most time with so don't run yourself<br>down I conclude by saying what does this<br>doctorate mean to me well let me tell<br>you I've asked a lot of hugely<br>successful people oh you were so<br>successful you must be very proud of<br>yourself they go nah I didn't do this I<br>didn't do that look there's only one<br>person who can define success for you<br>and that's you you're the only person<br>that can tell yourself if you've done<br>enough and if you've got enough but I<br>must say that today has been absolutely<br>amazing I never expected this I would<br>have done everything that I did<br>regardless of this and if it never comes<br>again I will continue to do all the<br>things that I think that I should do but<br>this is the place that my legal Journey<br>started this is the University that<br>trained my mind and don't<br>forget that it is the power of the mind<br>that makes us Limitless most importantly<br>to the lawyers here who are graduating<br>today I need you to know that I have<br>loved my life in the law all the Downs<br>there were lots of them getting kicked<br>around and CAU all the things I messed<br>up uh there have been some UPS there<br>have been lots of Wiggly lines uh but I<br>have loved it all and it's not over yet<br>so as a consequence of that the super<br>diversity Institute that I have founded<br>is going to gift an award it's a unique<br>legal Viewpoint award there will be four<br>of them uh $2,500 uh each time it's for<br>the most Innovative in terms

will<br>nominate what am I trying to do<br>look you graduated today in Science and<br>Arts and all manner of things in law I I<br>was at a function earlier this week uh<br>with a lot of Judges each one of those<br>judges is unique they bring a unique<br>Viewpoint to the law it adds to who we<br>are and it develops the common law so I<br>wanted to put my money where my mouth is<br>if it goes well well we'll donate some<br>more and if that goes well well then I<br>shall spread it out through all the law<br>schools in New Zealand we tried it out<br>on a judge Fraser and I did uh at this<br>function and I'm happy to say that<br>they're very interested in the work that<br>will be selected for the awards so it's<br>all right I've finished to the graduants<br>today today is the day
