n Professor Canon C<br>T please join me in welcoming Professor<br>address<br>AR wananga Oro cor Richard Canon too<br>inoa Nora tenot tenot<br>ten Chancellor Vice Chancellor council<br>members colleagues recent graduates<br>friends and far now it is a great honor<br>for me to give this graduation<br>address the pepea I started with<br>indicates that I'm from England that I<br>grew up in a town called Watford and<br>have ended up as a professor at defar<br>wananga Oto the university ofo in Otti<br>denen<br>first and foremost congratulations to<br>our new graduates this is your day your<br>moment in the spotlight on the stage and<br>in the sun secondly congratulations to<br>the far now and friends here today you<br>too have made it to the end of this<br>journey and can take pride in the<br>achievements of those seated<br>below this afternoon I'd like to share<br>some Reflections on this ceremony some<br>reflections on teaching and learning and<br>finally offer some advice to our new<br>graduates firstly this ceremony what a<br>strange mixture of the ancient and<br>modern gowns hoods fancy hats and a song<br>in Latin combined with the latest<br>fashions fresh flowers the latest phones<br>and Facebook and Instagram<br>posts there's a long tradition behind<br>this ceremony and I am no stranger to<br>tradition my education and employment<br>has involved a number of Institutions<br>with long established traditions and<br>Latin<br>motos my high school in Watford England<br>was established in<br>1704 and has the Latin motto spati parti<br>which means be prepared and hope this<br>motto held me in good stead for my high<br>school School exams it must have worked<br>because I made it to<br>University my university in England was<br>founded in<br>1209 over 800 years ago and that's where<br>this gown comes from and a number of<br>lookalike gowns behind<br>me its motto is hink luch pocula<br>Sacra which<br>means from here we derive light and<br>sacred<br>drafts and those are not the drafts<br>you've experienced in denen Flats rather<br>sacred<br>drinks you are now alumni of the<br>university ofo and join with alumni<br>going back to its establishment in<br>1869 the University's motto is sapare OD<br>dare to be wise and I'll come back to<br>that<br>later my role at the University of atago<br>Faculty of Dentistry as the chancellor<br>has indicated has mostly involved<br>research and teaching not clinical<br>tuition but I've had the privilege of<br>teaching oral microbiology to Dentistry<br>oral health and dental technology<br>students although I've been employed to<br>teach to impart knowledge I have also<br>learned as part of that process and I'd<br>like to reflect on what I have<br>learned firstly I've learned that<br>students do not like lectures going over<br>time so I will keep this<br>brief secondly I have learned that our<br>students are resilient and<br>resourceful you have demonstrated your<br>resilience and resourcefulness through<br>the disruptions caused by the covid-19<br>pandemic you have mastered Zoom Meetings<br>online learning and online exams<br>thirdly through my involvement in<br>interprofessional education the use of<br>context-rich problems and problem-based<br>learning I have seen how you work with<br>your fellow students to learn and solve<br>problems in interprofessional education<br>students from all the different health<br>professional programs learn from each<br>other and decide how to provide<br>comprehensive care for for patients with<br>complex Health<br>needs context-rich problems and<br>problem-based learning exercises involve<br>groups of students researching a<br>clinical presentation and working<br>together to come up with a plan of<br>problem 3 weeks ago I was at a<br>microbiology conference in Oakland where<br>I gave a rather self-indulgent talk on<br>my research<br>career from when I was an undergraduate<br>to the present<br>day as I prepared for that talk it was<br>sobering to realize that when I<br>graduated 40 years ago there were very<br>few personal computers no mobile phones<br>and no email or internet as we know them<br>today knowledge came from books and<br>through educational<br>institutions how things have changed now<br>you have access to an overwhelmingly<br>vast amount of information at your<br>fingertips via your<br>smartphones but how reliable is that<br>information there is news and false<br>news there's valid information and false<br>information and there are facts and<br>there is fiction conspiracy theories and<br>rabbit holes and now information can<br>even be synthesized by artificial<br>logarithms I'd like for a moment to<br>consider the difference between<br>knowledge and<br>wisdom knowledge consists of facts<br>information and skills acquired by a<br>person through<br>education it is the theoretical or<br>practical understanding of a<br>subject wisdom on the other hand is the<br>ability to use your knowledge and<br>experience to make good decisions and<br>judgments one further thing I've learned<br>is that students have a very short<br>attention span so i' better bring this<br>address to an<br>end where does this leave you as you<br>graduate you have reached a significant<br>milestone in your education and many of<br>you will be be about to start a career<br>in Healthcare or medical<br>laboratories those jobs will not be easy<br>there will be challenges and difficult<br>decisions to<br>make we on the stage have imparted our<br>knowledge we have guided your<br>research we have tested your Knowledge<br>and<br>Skills you have passed your exams and<br>graduated but more than achieving exam<br>grades and receiving certificates I hope<br>that the experiences you have had at<br>atago in and out of your classes and the<br>experiences you will continue to have in<br>your careers with colleagues friends and<br>Faro will give you the wisdom to<br>identify true knowledge and the wisdom<br>to make courageous decisions and<br>judgments that you will need within and<br>outside your<br>career finally if there's one thing I<br>hope you'll remember from this your<br>graduation address it is this sapere OD<br>dare to be wise Nora tenaco tenot ten<br>K thank you very much Professor Canon<br>Richard for uh speaking to us today<br>we're
