student<br>services at the University of otago I<br>want to acknowledge everyone in the town<br>hall everyone on the live stream and any<br>people of the future who may be watching<br>this graduates it is my very great honor<br>to be here today to celebrate your<br>graduation with you this is a day to<br>acknowledge your hard work your<br>sacrifices your determination your<br>resilience and your success<br>congratulations and unless something has<br>gone terribly terribly wrong with our<br>systems you did it well<br>done you completed your degree and this<br>or or diploma and this is a huge<br>accomplishment and a real credit to you<br>thank you for having chosen Oto for this<br>part of your<br>education it is also a day to<br>acknowledge the hard work the sacrifice<br>the determination the resilience and the<br>success of those who supported you<br>behind every one of our graduates is a<br>collection of cheerleaders Bank rollers<br>counselors trained and not so TR trained<br>interested but slightly puzzled loved<br>ones Fierce aunties tired partners and<br>relieved staff and to you I also say<br>congratulations thank you for having<br>supported your loved one your friend<br>your student for this part of their<br>education this graduation celebration is<br>also a celebration of you<br>today I want to talk about our hidden<br>stories every graduate carries stories<br>that are filled with the challenges and<br>triumphs of the time during ADOT tago<br>and we do not always tell each other our<br>stories perhaps we think people might<br>already know or they won't be interested<br>or couldn't possibly understand what<br>we've been through but sharing our<br>stories is vital by sharing our<br>experiences we make connections with<br>others when we connect with others we<br>create opportunities to celebrate<br>differences to to opportunities for<br>understanding opportunities to discover<br>commonalities sharing stories gives us a<br>chance to see the humanity in each other<br>something we very much need to do right<br>now we stand on a precipice where we<br>what we could focus on is that which<br>divides us rather than that which unites<br>us we need to focus on the humanity that<br>binds us we need to work together to<br>stay connected and so I hope you take<br>some time today to reflect upon your<br>story and to share it with someone you<br>never know who you may inspire you never<br>know who you may comfort in case you<br>don't know where to start at a guess I<br>would say some of your stories include<br>the time you aced an assignment or you<br>handed in a chapter at the last possible<br>moment with minimal prep and your<br>lecturer loved it there'll be other<br>times when your lecturer failed to see<br>your utter utter Brilliance despite you<br>being incredibly aware of it some of<br>your stories will include discovering<br>what you thought you came here to do was<br>completely wrong for<br>you uh some stories will be an<br>affirmation of what you always knew that<br>you wanted to do all your stories will<br>include the transition to Mastery of<br>skills through hard work and<br>perseverance some of your Journeys may<br>have been plain sailing but but the vast<br>majority include a storm or two for<br>those who are first in family coming to<br>tertiary study your story May feature<br>how alien the university environment<br>seemed initially your story may also<br>include a montage of sleet and tactic<br>wind whipping through your flat wearing<br>socks over your ice over your shoes in<br>the ice but also the otago experience is<br>characterized by care and so I know you<br>will have received care from one of the<br>amazing in teams in student services in<br>the colleges and student experience and<br>in your departments and so I hope that<br>care features in your story too some<br>stories will include multiple part-time<br>jobs finding your people late night<br>lifts home from campus watch<br>homesickness wrangling flat flatmates or<br>group projects a crush or two and maybe<br>even true love I really hope some of<br>your stories include changing your mind<br>learning about something so different<br>and new to you that your perspective is<br>profoundly and utterly altered and<br>expanded for in this shift lies the real<br>power and hope and<br>education the thing I imagine all your<br>stories will feature is<br>covid-19 co is the co-star nobody wanted<br>for many of you your entire degree or<br>diploma was undertaken Amid Amid the<br>pandemic I want to acknowledge that for<br>you for your friends for your Faro this<br>made the big deal of doing what you did<br>an even bigger deal at a time when you<br>should have been experimenting with life<br>we learned it was dangerous to do so<br>what we've been through should not be<br>underestimated what you have achieved<br>should not be<br>underestimated if you are tired and a<br>little lost right now that is completely<br>understandable be kind to yourself and<br>to others the last few years have been a<br>lot when I reflect upon the story of my<br>education I'm grateful for a number of<br>things I'm grateful there was no social<br>media and I'm really grateful there was<br>no pandemic I'm grateful for the freedom<br>I had for the opportunity to zigzag my<br>way through an education that led to the<br>chance to Zig and zag my way through a<br>career that I never expected but I'm<br>extremely grateful to have<br>had as a child my memory of my earliest<br>career aspirations was to be a vet I<br>never really wanted to be a vet I just<br>wanted a golden<br>retriever I also wanted to be an<br>astrophysicist and I recall the moment<br>when I I discovered that that meant I<br>had to do physics<br>disappointing I also wanted to be the<br>Prime Minister a job I am currently very<br>happy not to<br>have I was fortunate to be born in a<br>middle class family to socially liberal<br>University educated parents as a family<br>living in a small conservative<br>conservative town we protested against a<br>part eight in nuclear weapons we<br>collected for all manner of Charities my<br>father swore at the TV news for the<br>entire 70s and 80s and my mother ensured<br>that we were aware of how lucky we were<br>I grew up immersed in the importance of<br>service to others I am very grateful for<br>that given this Head Start I worked hard<br>I went to University having Le fanger at<br>17 and Al at 18 at the ripe old age of<br>20 I'd finished my OE and became a<br>mature<br>student I remember the fear of being<br>found out that I'd only passed uee by<br>three marks but I gave it all a go<br>anyway I went to University to study law<br>I quickly realized it wasn't the thing<br>for me I did find I love political<br>studies and history and I was fortunate<br>to fortunate to study in an amazing and<br>vibrant departments filled with<br>exceptional researchers and more<br>importantly to me as student exceptional<br>teachers somewhere along the way I<br>thought I wanted to become an academic<br>so I studied all the ways in which my<br>good teachers taught well and my less<br>good teachers taught less well I was<br>really annoying about it during my<br>Master's Degree I was fortunate to start<br>teaching and for a few years I moved<br>between teaching politics during the<br>year and and as uh the chancellor said<br>undertaking university University<br>Administration during the breaks I<br>zigged from politics to ethics a thing I<br>think on the national stage Could<br>usefully Happen about now and I zagged<br>from Oakland to otago I found everything<br>about moving to otago a huge surprise I<br>had to learn how to live in Antarctic<br>Riviera I also had to quickly learn how<br>to teach a subject I knew very little<br>about out I remember the fear of being<br>found out but I gave it a go anyway I<br>learned how to apply the critical<br>thinking skills I had gained in politics<br>to a new area and I learned the<br>importance of constantly working on<br>communication skills these skills have<br>been foundational to everything I have<br>done since somewhere along the way I<br>realized that as much as I love teaching<br>and serving the university commun<br>community I wasn't into my degree quite<br>so much sitting somewhere on a computer<br>computer that seems more abicus than<br>iPhone is an incomplete PhD I<br>occasionally tell my bosses behind me<br>that one day I might finish it don't<br>tell them but I am<br>lying I zigged from teaching to as an<br>academic staff member to teaching as a<br>professional one I've had the pleasure<br>of talking with hundreds of Masters and<br>PhD students about the importance of<br>good communication of managing<br>supervisors of time management of<br>looking after themselves of when to to<br>push through and when to say enough's<br>enough along the way I've mucked things<br>up met amazing people from diverse<br>backgrounds had Untold laughs and made<br>some wonderful friends and learned a<br>whole lot of new skills and ideas I also<br>hope I helped some people I zigged and<br>zagged my way around the university a<br>few more times with every role I've had<br>I faced some the same things I faced the<br>moment when I had no clue how to do<br>something and the fear that I would not<br>be able to master what I needed to learn<br>sometimes I was more right to worry than<br>others but with each role I found<br>something new to excite me something old<br>that I could bring to the job and<br>something I could borrow from someone I<br>admired if it sounds like I might have<br>been married to my work perhaps I have<br>been I have worked now in student<br>services for 18 months if you used the<br>gym borrowed some skis visited a doctor<br>saw a counselor access disability<br>support got some career advice found a<br>home away from home at toar todaka or<br>the Pacific island Center received<br>spiritual support got looked after by<br>campus watch or made a visit to the<br>Proctor's office then you interacted<br>with student services working in student<br>services highlights for me that the<br>University of Oto is an institution<br>cemented by care I work with an<br>exceptional group of people who provide<br>exceptional care to students and it is a<br>real privilege to be able to do that the<br>team and student services shared many of<br>your hidden stories and I know they<br>believe it's a privilege to have stood<br>alongside you at your time at Oto and<br>they also wish you well I am fortunate<br>to have colleagues who are fantastic I<br>am grateful for the chances I have been<br>given I am grateful for the patience I<br>have received for the generosity and<br>support of a community that really cares<br>about each other and our students<br>I'm grateful for skills of critical<br>thinking of the opportunities to learn<br>from my mistakes the chance to reinvent<br>myself and to give back to something I<br>truly believe in as I zigged and zagged<br>my way through a career that I never<br>imagined would lead here I have been<br>taught by great teachers some inside the<br>classroom and some outside I continue to<br>learn and I hope that a love of learning<br>has been instilled in you no matter what<br>degree you have you will have learned<br>how to learn and I hope that that the<br>most important lesson you can take and<br>apply wherever you go I hope you find<br>opportunities for Meaningful work and<br>valuable relationships just as I have<br>there are some challenges ahead of us<br>look to the past to understand what we<br>must be done in the future so we do not<br>unthinkingly perpetuate Injustice or<br>repeat the mistakes of those that have<br>gone before us share your story<br>but me even more importantly listen to<br>the stories of those around you seek to<br>understand their path so that you can<br>connect and work to clear it even just a<br>little for them if you end up zigging or<br>zagging a little that's okay if you end<br>up zigging and zagging a lot that's also<br>okay nothing is wasted as long as we<br>look out for one another as well as<br>ourselves stay curious be kind be great<br>ful be a little bit scared but give it a<br>go anyway it's all part of being human<br>and like your degree or diploma that is<br>something to celebrate in closing let me<br>congratulate you once again and finish<br>with a favorite koho
