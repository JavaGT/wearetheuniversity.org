so<br>deservedly<br>happy seriously though this age-old and<br>yet still very Splendid tradition the<br>graduation ritual provides us all in<br>different ways a moment of pause a<br>moment to reflect on how all of those<br>often agonized but necessarily long<br>hours of study of reading of thinking of<br>research of teaching of writing and<br>rewriting of computer fails of brain<br>fail fails relationship fails of marking<br>and<br>remarking are all now behind us as is<br>the right of passage the graduation<br>itself Beyond Now lies the celebration<br>and then The Confident move toward that<br>New Horizon of opportunity which surely<br>beckons you<br>all for those of you who have supported<br>children mapuna spouses friends maybe<br>even a grand Grand parent I hope this<br>very special moment provides you a sense<br>of welld deserved affirmation for all<br>you have done by way of offering up<br>unconditional support sacrifice Solace<br>security tissues<br>takeaways kisses and kakia and maybe at<br>times even just a little unguarded<br>exasperation to my academic colleagues<br>our shared pride in these ceremonies is<br>always so compelling and deservedly so<br>for ours are both the privileged task<br>and the challenge of forming and shaping<br>of critiquing nurturing and affirming<br>the infinitely precious life of the mind<br>I know firsthand just how many of you<br>contribute professionally way above and<br>beyond and so it is with deep affection<br>and abundant<br>admiration that I bow to you for your<br>dedication your colleagueship and for so<br>much<br>more to all the gradu I offer you very<br>warm congratulations as you have<br>doubtless initially nervously now<br>completed your very own Unforgettable<br>walk across the stage to receive your<br>toou the enduring symbol or official<br>marker of your academic success<br>to Mai the word toou is derivative of<br>the word<br>toonga this is the word used to describe<br>those select few set aside for their<br>very specialized expertise whether as<br>healers Visionaries wise leaders expert<br>guides<br>advisors as inspired and inspiring<br>leaders teachers or as Guardians of the<br>spiritual<br>Realm toonga know they are commissioned<br>or blessed into the service of the<br>people because of their particular gifts<br>their charism for leadership and their<br>humility they are trusted respected<br>sometimes even revered and they act<br>accordingly always with integrity and<br>with considered wisdom they are fearless<br>and therefore unafraid of speaking truth<br>to power they exist to serve and thus to<br>sustain the Comm<br>good now I know you are sitting there<br>and saying well that's a very lovely<br>story but what has it actually got to do<br>with<br>me I want to tell you that relatively<br>speaking it actually has everything to<br>do with you for irrespective of the<br>nature or the level of the toou you have<br>now received you too are now being<br>commissioned into the service of<br>others because of the intellectual gifts<br>and expertise you have now provably<br>demonstrated and because of the<br>particular charism and the demeanor of<br>the educated<br>person a demeanor which you now possess<br>this University in this fabulous public<br>ceremony has now proudly conferred upon<br>you membership of the educated class of<br>our<br>society whether you are set to be a high<br>level Specialist toer or simply a<br>hardworking trustworthy University<br>qualified professional your graduation<br>today therefore Accords you both a<br>reputation and a<br>responsibility a reputation that you can<br>be trusted to think clearly correctly<br>and critically and a responsibility to<br>act always with fairness with dignity<br>and<br>decency you have become what John Henry<br>Newman describes as the ideal graduate<br>you are now people with clear conscious<br>views of your own opinions and judgments<br>you have an eloquence and expressing<br>them and a force in urging them you have<br>been taught to disentangle a scce of<br>thought to detect what is sophistical<br>and to disregard what is<br>irrelevant down Through the Ages those<br>like you who have chosen the Humanity's<br>pathway are those thus described by<br>Michelle Obama the Arts and the<br>humanities Define who we are as a people<br>that is their power to remind us of what<br>we each have to offer and what we have<br>in<br>common to help us understand our history<br>and imagine our future to give us hope<br>in the moments of struggle and to bring<br>us together when nothing else will you<br>are now therefore each in your own right<br>well on your way to becoming Feist and<br>confident public intellectuals and in<br>this moment I am so honored to salute<br>you for your academic success and to<br>welcome you with open arms to the<br>collective tasks that lie<br>ahead as I attempt to place myself in<br>your shoes I am however foremost filled<br>with<br>anxiety for as I said to another<br>graduating class in Berkeley California<br>just a few months ago the 2 first<br>century has not gifted us a Brave New<br>World but rather an increasingly<br>cowardly old world where too often greed<br>eclipses<br>egalitarianism where charity is<br>contingent upon its tax<br>advantages where violence public and<br>private is endemic where morality let<br>alone human decency appears now as<br>untranslatable into the discourses and<br>behaviors of the Public Square<br>s where the milk of hum kindness is<br>daily soured by the unbidden human<br>additives of prejudice and bigotry of<br>race and or religious hatred and yet it<br>wasn't meant to be this<br>way here in altero New Zealand we boast<br>a proud tradition of universal primary<br>education for example and yet the<br>quality of that educational experience<br>for at least 300 50,000 of our children<br>is daily severely curtailed by poverty<br>and its attended evils of poor health<br>and domestic<br>violence environmental sustainability is<br>constantly threatened Public Health has<br>never been so pressured the issues of<br>gender equality and lgbtq rights<br>continue often to elicit such<br>astonishingly pural political responses<br>that they leave most of us just shaking<br>our heads with both sadness and<br>incredulity disinformation Remains the<br>most dangerous destabilizing force in<br>our society AI is looming and what about<br>mere mention now<br>of indigenous rights Mai co-governance<br>this then is the societal context within<br>which you as graduates confident<br>courageous and compassionate are now set<br>to make your mark to offer your<br>contributions to make a<br>difference let me reiterate that I have<br>every confidence in you to reframe the<br>Mantra from the passive it wasn't meant<br>to be this way to the proactive it shall<br>not continue to be this way for yours is<br>the generation which for the first time<br>in human history possesses the<br>information information knowledge<br>technology and resources to bring the<br>worst of human suffering and Injustice<br>virtually to an<br>end yours is the generation which must<br>however also understand that the<br>promises of the future cannot be<br>fulfilled simply by the acquisition of<br>more and more knowledge alone but that<br>what is also so desperately needed is a<br>commensurate increase in loving wisdom<br>of reverence for life for the Earth and<br>for one<br>another it is in this way that I humbly<br>encourage you to see yourselves<br>therefore not just as purveyors of<br>valuable knowledge but concurrently as<br>exemplars of the civic-minded virtues of<br>compassion kindness respect and<br>generosity for it is surely only the<br>combination of those treasured human<br>qualities together with a strong and<br>confident intellectual capacity which<br>can form modal citizens<br>for that most highly prized ideal of a<br>nurturing and free<br>Society a society in which all are<br>enable to participate to contribute and<br>to flourish and within which none are<br>ever enabled to unjustly dominate or<br>oppress I know you can I know you must<br>and I know you will do all you can to<br>make things<br>better whether we act in small probably<br>publicly unnoticed ways or whether we<br>are destined to act in profoundly<br>significant publicly recognized ways<br>what matters ultimately is that above<br>all else we do act for this is the<br>Mandate that this toou you have now<br>received requires of you to<br>fulfill now I know the matters I have<br>raised may possibly be seen as too<br>daunting maybe even inappropriate for<br>this moment but right now as one of you<br>as one with you as your immensely proud<br>teacher Auntie grandmother sister<br>graduate I feel it would be utterly<br>remiss if I didn't challenge you to<br>consider your ongoing responsibility to<br>both imagine and to innovate the most<br>radical of future possibilities for<br>yourselves and particularly for those<br>whose Futures May someday be quite<br>literally in your hands I say this<br>because I can assure you that right now<br>your younger siblings your cousins your<br>teammates your workmates those who have<br>either not yet chosen nor yet been as<br>privileged as you to enjoy academic<br>opportunity and success are now looking<br>to you as as graduates to model what it<br>means to care deeply about The Human<br>Condition to help us understand history<br>and to imagine our<br>future and and so let me ask you to<br>consider whether you do feel ready to<br>hold the future of others in your hands<br>are you ready now to to use this<br>precious toou you have just received to<br>lead with fearlessness and to be<br>unafraid of speaking truth to power you<br>see as a theologian but more so in this<br>moment as a grandmother I believe that<br>the least Among Us especially children<br>always deserve honest answers to the<br>these<br>questions in closing therefore let me<br>remind you that I've already expressed<br>my vote of confidence in you but just in<br>case any of you are still<br>wondering I have a very simple<br>suggestion to make and it is that you<br>undertake on this your graduation day<br>13th of December<br>2023 to hold up a metaphoric mirror for<br>I guarantee you will catch a glimpse of<br>the toonga with remember you can you<br>must and you will step up to make a<br>difference to be that change for the<br>good you yearn for in the world of
