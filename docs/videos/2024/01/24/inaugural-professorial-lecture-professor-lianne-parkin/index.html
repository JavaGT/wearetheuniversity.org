to<br>welcome you all to this very special<br>occasion to celebrate lean Parkins<br>promotion to<br>Professor these lectures are always a<br>great opportunity for us to take time<br>out and to actually listen to our<br>amazing staff and broaden our<br>understanding of research and of their<br>research journey to get to where they<br>are<br>now I would particularly like to welcome<br>colleagues from across the university as<br>well as students and friends but I'd<br>like to give a very special welcome to<br>Leanne's friends and family who've<br>joined us this evening especially her<br>sister Amanda Parkin her brother-in-law<br>Ian tenant and two close friends Rowan<br>um Jeffrey from Christ Church and<br>Allison balance from Nelson who are with<br>us today and also joining us live on the<br>live stream Leanne's nephew James tenant<br>and Barbara Shaw a friend from<br>kindergarten so it's<br>amazing so what will happen now is I'm<br>going to just say a few words and then<br>I'm going to hand over to um Professor<br>Patricia priest to formally introduce<br>Leanne and then we will wait and listen<br>to Leanne's<br>story so promotion to professor at Targo<br>is something to be celebrated and really<br>recognizes the person's strengths in<br>teaching research and<br>service Leanne's career like some of us<br>here tonight has not followed a path<br>that's gone straight from point A to<br>point B and I suspect we may hear more<br>about that that<br>tonight um but Leanne is<br>is really um a an excellent researcher<br>involved in a range of national and<br>international collaborations in the area<br>of Public Health she's also an<br>experienced teacher and research<br>supervisor and she's contributed<br>significantly to a variety of national<br>agencies such as pharmac medsafe as well<br>as providing excellent service to the<br>university so congratulations Leanne on<br>your very well-deserved promotion to<br>professor and I and I know all of us<br>here are looking forward to your lecture<br>so I'd now like to invite Trish to um<br>nor<br>taoto AO so I'm Trish priest I'm the<br>acting proce Chancellor of Health<br>Sciences um and my role is to welcome<br>you to Professor Leanne Parkin's<br>inaugural professorial<br>lecture uh to provide a brief<br>introduction to her and to outline the<br>topic of her lecture although I'm mainly<br>um doing the former I think um it gives<br>me particular pleasure to introduce<br>Professor Leanne Parkin I'm going to<br>keep saying that um who I've known for<br>42 years we were in the same second year<br>medical class um Al although I'm not<br>quite sure how I came to know her better<br>than I did many of my classmates I can't<br>actually remember I've always thought<br>that given our surnames we must have<br>been put together in a group somewhere<br>at some point but I checked this<br>afternoon and there were eight other<br>students with surnames beginning with p<br>between us and the alphabet so I don't<br>think that's the reason don't know what<br>there was about the surnames beginning<br>with p in our year um Professor Parkin's<br>lecture doesn't provide any detail of<br>her time at medical school so I want to<br>add a couple of my memories of her from<br>that time first I remember her as the<br>most stylish student in the<br>class and um Second and more<br>importantly I have an abiding memory of<br>when leam was I think in fifth year<br>medicine in Christ Church and I was in<br>fourth year having taken a year out and<br>she was a key voice against the terrible<br>practice of the time of teaching medical<br>students how to do vaginal exam<br>minations by practicing on anesthetized<br>woman without their consent um her in<br>integrity and willingness to stand up<br>for what was right um vocally um was a<br>real inspiration to those of us who like<br>me didn't have the courage to do that<br>and coped by just not turning up to the<br>session where we were supposed to do it<br>so I've always really admired lean's um<br>staunchness in that in that time and<br>doing the right<br>thing it was one of the pleasures of<br>returning to denan for me that I got to<br>work in an office along the corridor<br>from Leanne and get to know her again<br>having not seen her for many years um<br>and I also just want to acknowledge that<br>when I was the head of Department of<br>preventive and social medicine she was a<br>huge support especially around the covid<br>time when um everything they need there<br>was a lot that needed to be done and she<br>was a a good steady um well organized<br>support Professor Parkin as um Helen<br>said as an accomplished teacher of<br>epidemiology and a pharmacoepidem<br>mediologist who's also worked on the<br>broader risk factors for Venus<br>thromboembolism and on D data linkage as<br>she will demonstrate in her lecture she<br>has strong links with important<br>International researchers including at<br>Oxford in North America and<br>Europe her Focus persistence and careful<br>planning has led to the development of a<br>New Zealand pharmaco epidemiology<br>research<br>Network when I was head of Department I<br>often suggested to junior staff that<br>they go and talk to Professor Parkin<br>about how she went about that journey to<br>help them plan a similar<br>trajectory um she's had great success in<br>obtaining research grants and Publishing<br>papers in very good peer-reviewed<br>journals what she probably won't dwell<br>on is other aspects of her work and<br>achievements so to give you a bit of<br>context I will mention<br>some Professor Parkin's contribution to<br>epidemiology um more broadly includes as<br>an editor for the international Journal<br>of<br>epidemiology as a member of some I uh<br>International epidemiology Association<br>committees and as the president of the<br>New Zealand branch of the a austral<br>Asian epidemiology Association for a<br>period she's the ministerially appointed<br>epidemiologist on the medicine's adverse<br>reactions Committee of government and<br>has peer-reviewed programs of work for<br>the Ministry of Health and for pharmac<br>she has served as the epidemiologist on<br>the University of otago human Ethics<br>Committee for health a very important<br>role as all of you who have applied for<br>ethics approval for your research will<br>be very aware<br>of I need to stop and let Professor<br>Parkin uh tell you about herself and her<br>work now I'm privileged to have seen an<br>advanced copy of the slides and it won't<br>surprise those of you who know her that<br>it's extremely well organized Tells A<br>wellth through story and is very<br>informative I'm looking forward to the<br>Teno<br>um Tina Coto c um and thank you so much<br>for coming along this evening those of<br>you here who are here in person and uh<br>thank you to those of you who are online<br>I know there's quite a few um I was uh I<br>found out just before Christmas of last<br>year that I was going to be promoted to<br>professor and I'm going to put my<br>glasses on and what's seemed like a<br>disconcertingly short time after that I<br>received an email from the University<br>asking me to see uh select a date for my<br>IPL and so I selected the latest<br>available date and um replied to the<br>email to ask whether there were any<br>guidelines regarding<br>ipls and this is the response that I<br>received so no firm guidelines about<br>content uh it's supposed to be a<br>celebration of how I got to where I am<br>today and that a lot of people start by<br>talking about their<br>background now I also talked with some<br>colleagues um and a few were adamant<br>that ipls should focus solely on<br>Research While others were equally adant<br>that the most interesting ipls included<br>autobiographical elements so this<br>created a bit of a dilemma for me so as<br>a compromise I've decided to provide a<br>bit of autobiographical background and<br>then I'll focus on Research<br>now I'm aware that many academics move<br>in a very orderly fashion through to<br>Professor progressing from their<br>bachelor's degree to um an honors degree<br>or postgrad diploma and then to a<br>master's PhD postdoc and so<br>on um however my career path has not<br>been that tidy I don't have a a master's<br>degree I didn't do a postdoc and I spent<br>quite a bit of time doing vocation<br>profal medical training clinical work<br>and other activities after completing my<br>bachelor's degree so I thought that my<br>career path has really been a bit more<br>like a braided<br>River and for those of you who don't<br>know what a braided river is here's a<br>photograph of one that has particular<br>significance for me the hakeri river and<br>as you can see there are two or three uh<br>main channels that twist and turn their<br>way along the riverbed as well as minor<br>channels and little back<br>Waters now one of the things about<br>moving swiftly down one of the main<br>channels of a braided river is that you<br>don't get much time to look at your<br>surroundings and the stones in the river<br>bed can look tend to look very similar<br>in in perhaps a little boring but if you<br>deviate off into one of the smaller side<br>channels or back Waters you actually<br>have time to notice that the stones are<br>really quite diverse and interesting and<br>as you'll see short shortly I've um<br>actually spent quite a bit of time in<br>metaphorical side channels and<br>backwaters looking at things that really<br>interest<br>me I was born and raised on the<br>Canterbury Plains in ash Burton which is<br>situated on the banks of the hakeri<br>river and it's also close to some other<br>braided Rivers such as the rangitata and<br>the rakaya and these Rivers all flow<br>down from the snow covered Alps across<br>the Plains and down to the ocean<br>and just as you have to go back to its<br>source to develop a complete<br>understanding of the life of a river I'm<br>going to begin the story of my academic<br>path with my<br>pre-university<br>education and so here it<br>is and I suppose it looks pretty<br>standard except that I was very<br>fortunate to be born at the time that I<br>was because I was the first girl on<br>either side of my extended family to<br>have been given the opportunity to have<br>more than three years of secondary<br>school<br>education my mother did extremely well<br>at school but she wasn't given a chance<br>to progress past the fifth form or year<br>11 in these terminology of today and nor<br>were any of my aunties and my<br>grandmothers had even less opportunity<br>they completed primary school and then<br>they had to start<br>working but my parents were very<br>determined that my sister and I would<br>have the opportunity to finish secondary<br>school and go on to<br>University<br>now in terms of my taxpaying working<br>career um that actually began when I was<br>14 when I was employed as an assistant<br>to Father Christmas at the um at the<br>Farmers Co-op where my father worked and<br>in subsequent years I worked in other<br>departments at the farmers and I had a<br>variety of other holiday and weekend<br>jobs including working as a nurse aid at<br>the rest home where my mother worked and<br>although my favorite subjects at school<br>were English and and history I my<br>experience working at the rest home made<br>me think about applying for medical<br>school but this tentative plan didn't uh<br>meet with the approval of the girls<br>careers advisor and yes we had separate<br>careers advisors for girls and boys at<br>my school at that time anyway the the<br>careers advisor said uh that medicine<br>was no career for a girl um and she said<br>that since I was quite good at meths I<br>could be a bank teller and and uh or if<br>I wanted to really aim high I could be a<br>primary school teacher or a<br>nurse I completely ignor this advice and<br>I went ahead and applied for medical<br>school and in those days you could uh<br>there were two ways of getting into<br>otago medical school as a undergraduate<br>the first was that you could apply while<br>you were still at school and if you<br>achieved high enough marks in the end of<br>your exams uh you were guaranteed a<br>position a place at Medical School<br>providing you pass your exams in the<br>medical intermediate year and if you<br>didn't get in that way you could U get<br>in you had a second chance by doing<br>really well in the medical intermediate<br>year um and the the first method of<br>getting into medical school that I<br>mentioned was preferential entry and I<br>was lucky enough to to get that and that<br>gave me quite a lot of flexibility in my<br>first year at University and so as well<br>as taking the required papers I also<br>took some papers on Greek and Roman<br>literature and art and architecture<br>which was really great except that um it<br>created a bit of a dilemma at the end of<br>the year because I was really torn<br>between going to medical school and<br>doing a classical studies degree but in<br>the end I went to medical school and in<br>another piece of Good Fortune related to<br>the time at which I was born we didn't<br>have to pay exorbitant tuition fees<br>although we still had some fees and we<br>had to buy text books and cover the<br>general costs of<br>living but by working during the<br>holidays the university holidays I was<br>able to get through Medical School<br>almost debt-free which many students<br>cannot do<br>nowadays and as well as providing wages<br>some of those jobs were really really<br>enjoyable for example I measured water<br>flows in High Country station uh streams<br>and rivers and what would later become<br>the hakeri Conservation Park I helped to<br>cut a new section of Riverside track in<br>what would later become the paparoa<br>national<br>park but anyway after six years of um<br>time at University I graduated with a<br>medical degree and then completed my<br>first house surgeon year in the north<br>Ireland in W<br>cutle and at the end of that year I<br>decided to take some time out to develop<br>some different skills and so I went to<br>Nelson polych and I took some classes in<br>silver smithing Woodwork and and car<br>maintenance and I ended up uh<br>reconditioning the engine of the 1959<br>mini that I owned at the<br>time after that I uh took a Terell<br>immersion course at faku<br>marai and then I returned to denen um<br>and took up a general house surgeon<br>position and during that time I applied<br>for a position the following year as an<br>Obstetrics and Gynecology house<br>surgeon however there was a 3mon gap<br>between positions and so I spent the<br>summer Outdoors on tramping and camping<br>trips by the end of my appropriately 9<br>month um obstetric and Gynecology<br>position I had completed the diploma of<br>Obstetrics and had been accepted into<br>the GP training program however there<br>was a um a gap again between the end of<br>one job and the beginning of the next<br>and so I spent the summer outside again<br>on tramping and camping<br>trips and after a year as a GP regist I<br>passed the college part one exam and<br>then went on to do some GP<br>looms but then I had uh The Misfortune<br>to fall off a horse on a horse track and<br>among other injuries I broke my arm up<br>up near the top here and sustained a<br>radial nerve<br>py and after several months with no<br>signs of nerve recovery I began to<br>wonder um what kind of medical work I<br>could do with just one functioning arm<br>and so among other things I made an<br>appointment with um Professor Su David<br>skig who I remembered from medical<br>school had given some really really<br>interesting uh lectures on epidemiology<br>lectures um and David talked about<br>public health medicine as a potential<br>option however the radial nerve<br>eventually grew back and after about 9<br>months mons I was able to return to<br>clinical work and I had positions at<br>student health here in denan in general<br>practice and at the local Family<br>Planning clinic and I did that for a<br>couple of years and then I spent a few<br>years working in Australia at a Inner<br>City Health Center for Young homeless<br>people sex workers and injecting drug<br>users and after that I spent eight<br>months backpacking around the UK and<br>Western Europe and Eastern Europe and<br>into Russia and by this time it was 1996<br>so just a few years after the collapse<br>of the Soviet<br>Union and in 1997 I started back at<br>student health here again in denen and I<br>began a Russian<br>degree and the following year 1998 I<br>continued with those activities but I<br>also took a couple of postgrad Public<br>Health papers the first of which was<br>epidemiology and bio statistics and this<br>brought me back into contact with um<br>David<br>ski I also applied for the following<br>years's intake into Public Health<br>Medicine uh the Public Health Medicine<br>training program and then as now part<br>one of the training consisted of<br>completing a master of public health<br>degree in public health registr were<br>actually required to start their<br>Master's research before they'd even<br>completed the postgrad diploma of Public<br>Health however the that's a bit of a<br>theme there was a of a gap between one<br>role and the next so the Public Health<br>Training wasn't due to start until late<br>February of<br>1999 and so I headed off to Moscow State<br>University for a Russian language<br>immersion<br>experience and when I returned to denen<br>I continued taking postgrad Public<br>Health papers and started what was to<br>have been my Master's<br>project but after realizing that<br>epidemiology was really the area of<br>Public Health that I wanted to work in I<br>later applied to transfer to a PhD and I<br>was fortunate to be awarded a health<br>research Council clinical training uh<br>clinical research training<br>Fellowship but I couldn't take those up<br>immediately<br>either but this time I didn't go off<br>tramping um I couldn't take them off<br>immediately because I had to spend some<br>time in the local public health unit as<br>part of my Public Health Medicine<br>training anyway I eventually<br>got started on more research for my PhD<br>and a bit later on I was appointed as a<br>lecturer in<br>epidemiology and finally I completed my<br>PhD I passed the Public Health Medicine<br>Fellowship exam became a fellow of the<br>new newly established New Zealand<br>College of Public Health Medicine and<br>made my way through the various academic<br>titles so that's an overview of how I<br>got to where I got to today where I am<br>today and hopefully you now understand<br>why the braided River um metaphor came<br>to mind when I thought about my career<br>path anyway I'm going to move on now to<br>talk about research and just to note<br>some of the slides that I'll show will<br>have images of news or Journal articles<br>and I'm not expecting anyone to read<br>these because I'm not going to leave<br>them up for long enough they're just<br>there to provide a bit of color and a<br>bit of context to what I'm talking<br>about so I'm going to start my research<br>story in February of 1999 with this<br>article in New Zealand doctor and the<br>pill referred to in the title is the<br>combined oral contraceptive pill which<br>contains two hormones estrogen and<br>progestogen and from now on I'm just<br>going to refer to these types of pills<br>as oral<br>contraceptives and VTE is short for<br>Venus thromboembolism and this is a<br>collective term that includes both deep<br>vein thrombosis which you might have<br>heard referred to as DVT uh which is a<br>condition where blood clots form in the<br>Deep veins of the leg or the pelvis and<br>the second condition that comes under<br>the VTE Banner is uh pulmonary embolism<br>and this is where the DVT clots or parts<br>of them break off travel through the<br>bloodstream and Lodge in the<br>lungs and along with a photo of David<br>skig you can see that the Ministry of<br>Health has commissioned some research<br>into deaths from Venus fromo embolism<br>among users of so-called third<br>generation oral<br>contraceptives now at the time that this<br>article was published David had already<br>asked me whether I'd be interested in<br>undertaking This research for my masters<br>of Public Health thesis and he and<br>Professor Charlotte Paul would be my<br>supervisors and Professor Peter herbison<br>who I understand is online so hello<br>Peter um would be the the bio<br>statistician on the project and of<br>course I had accepted this invitation<br>but before I actually discuss the<br>research itself I want to give you a<br>quick bit of background and to do that I<br>need to take you back a few decades to<br>the 1960s the early 1960s when case<br>reports and descriptive studies first<br>suggested that there might be a link<br>between oral contraceptive fuse and<br>VTE and these Publications were followed<br>by some case control studies and then<br>cohort studies and I'm aware that a lot<br>of people in the audience won't be<br>amiliar with these types of studies so<br>I've created some simple diagrams just<br>to quickly illustrate the basic<br>principles of<br>each so if we were to carry out a case<br>control study to investigate whether the<br>use of oral contraceptives was<br>associated with a higher risk of VTE<br>than non-use we'd start with a defined<br>population of women of women of an<br>appropriate age in other words women in<br>the age group in which oral<br>contraceptives might be used either for<br>contraceptive or gynec ol ological<br>purposes and then we would identify all<br>women who developed VTE during a defined<br>period and this would be the case group<br>and then from the same population we<br>would randomly select some controls and<br>these would be women who hadn't<br>developed VTE during the same period and<br>this would be our control group and then<br>for both cases and controls taking<br>exactly the same approach for both<br>groups we would determine whether oral<br>contraceptives had been used before<br>defined index State and then we'd<br>calculate something called an odds ratio<br>which is an estimate of relative risk<br>and this would tell us whether or not<br>oral contraceptive use was associated<br>with a higher risk of VTE than<br>non-use in a cohort study we'd also<br>start with a um a population of women of<br>an appropriate age and we'd ascertain<br>whether they were using oral<br>contraceptives or not so we'd end up<br>with two groups users and nonusers<br>and then we' follow them up over time<br>and calculate the incidence of VTE in<br>the user and non-user groups and finally<br>would calculate the relative<br>risk now the case control and cohort<br>studies that were undertaken back in the<br>the 1960s and going into the 70s found<br>an association between oral<br>contraceptive use and VTE but there was<br>debate about whether this finding was<br>due to a causal relationship or whether<br>there was some other explanation<br>and it's very appropriate whenever we<br>find an association between an exposure<br>and an outcome to consider potential<br>non-causal<br>explanations in this instance however it<br>turned out that chance bias and<br>confounding were unlikely explanations<br>for the association between oral<br>contraceptive fuse and<br>VTE and so a consensus emerged that<br>there was a causal relationship between<br>oral contraceptive use and<br>VTE and also that the risk uh appeared<br>to be higher with higher doses of<br>estrogen well the progestogen component<br>of the pill didn't appear to be<br>important and since that time the<br>formulation of oral contraceptives has<br>changed considerably the dose of<br>estrogen has been progressively lowered<br>and new generations of presten have been<br>developed and in the 1990s early 1990s<br>the so-called third generation uh pills<br>were introduced and these contained one<br>of two new progestogens either destal or<br>gine and these third generation pills<br>were promoted as having a better<br>cardiovascular safety profile than older<br>lowdose<br>pills and so it came is quite a surprise<br>when four large and well-designed<br>studies published in late<br>1995 and a fifth study published in<br>early<br>1996 found that women using third<br>generation pills were about twice as<br>likely to develop VTE as compared with<br>women using lowd dose pills containing<br>another older progestogen called levo<br>nestal and you can see that one of the<br>studies also looked or estimated the<br>absolute risk of<br>VTE now there was considerable debate<br>about these findings including debates<br>about potential biases and confounding<br>about biological plausibility the<br>importance of any difference in risk and<br>other supposed benefits of third<br>generation<br>pills and then some people also argued<br>that the risk with third generation<br>pills was nothing to worry about because<br>after all it was a lot less than the<br>risk associated with pregnancy but of<br>course that would only be a valid<br>argument if the sole means of preventing<br>a pregnancy was a third generation<br>pill and the issue of competing<br>interests also arose um competing<br>interests in relation to pharmaceutical<br>industry funded research for instance<br>data from the fifth study which was<br>funded by a third generation pill<br>manufacturer um it was reanalyzed four<br>times until the association went to<br>Bray now this was all really relevant to<br>us here in New Zealand because almost<br>80% in 1995 almost 80% of oral<br>contraceptive users in this country were<br>taking a third generation pill and this<br>was the highest proportionate use in the<br>world<br>and one could argue that some of the<br>morbidity and mortality from Venus<br>thrombo embolism and young women might<br>have been avoided if other lowd dose<br>pills had been used<br>instead in July of 1996 the Ministry of<br>Health issued oral contraceptive<br>prescribing advice but this was actually<br>weaker than the advice recommended by<br>the medicine's adverse reactions<br>committee and it had minimal impact on<br>prescribing<br>practices so by the end of 1998 third<br>generation pills were still being<br>strongly advertised in the new ethical<br>uh catalog that was uh used by New<br>Zealand doctors and about 65% of oral<br>contraceptive fusers were still taking<br>pills but in December of that same year<br>Med safe which as you can see from the<br>slide is New Zealand's medin and medical<br>devices Safety Authority uh medsafe<br>reported that at least six3 generation<br>pill users had died from pulmonary<br>embolism during a relatively short<br>period of<br>time and this attracted a lot of media<br>attention and one of the third<br>generation pill manufacturers quickly<br>sent out a letter to all New Zealand<br>doctors with this quote from one of the<br>researchers involved with the fifth<br>original study the study that was<br>reanalyzed four<br>times in February uh mids safe reported<br>a further<br>death meanwhile um I was living in<br>student accommodation at Moscow State<br>University without any of the forms of<br>communication uh that we take for<br>granted today so it was no internet no<br>email no mobile phone so I was<br>completely unaware that I wasn't exactly<br>going to have a gentle introduction to<br>research but that became very obvious as<br>soon as I was back in New Zealand when<br>there was still a lot of media<br>coverage um and in May medsafe reported<br>a further two deaths amongst third<br>generation pill users and the media<br>1999 anyway um in between taking a<br>couple of postgrad Public Health papers<br>I carried out a national case control<br>study and in brief this involved<br>obtaining ethical approval from 12<br>Regional ethics committees so back in<br>those days we didn't have multi-region<br>ethics committees we had to go to four<br>uh 12 separate committees um we<br>requested information about potential<br>cases from the Ministry of Health so<br>women who had died from U pulmonary<br>embolism uh and I examined coroners<br>records and autopsy reports and death<br>certificates and hospital records to<br>determine whether the potential cases<br>had indeed died from pulmonary embolism<br>and unlike today when so much is digital<br>this actually involved uh me traveling<br>all over the country um to examine paper<br>records and and I use those same records<br>to um find the names of the GPS and also<br>police records because if women had died<br>very suddenly and unexpectedly police<br>were often called and if that those<br>methods to find the names of the GPS<br>failed then we wrote to the next of kin<br>of the women who had died<br>and I visited all of the general<br>practices that the women had attended<br>and randomly selected four controls from<br>those same<br>practices and I extracted medical and<br>contraceptive histories from the GP<br>records and also uh any family planning<br>records that existed for both cases and<br>controls and then uh Peter hson and I<br>worked on the<br>analysis and we published the findings<br>of the research in June of<br>2000 and we found that users of any type<br>of oral contraceptive were almost 10<br>times as likely to die from pulmonary<br>embolism when compared with<br>non-users and you can also see that the<br>odds ratios for users of third<br>generation pills were almost three times<br>that of Leo nestal pills although of<br>course the New Zealand population is<br>small and and fortunately fatal<br>pulmonary embolism among young women is<br>very rare and so the numbers in our<br>study were quite small and the<br>confidence intervals are therefore<br>correspondingly very<br>wide now we'd also obtained some<br>information from the Ministry of Health<br>about oral contraceptive um supplies and<br>we had used these data to estimate the<br>absolute risk of death from pulmonary<br>embolism and uses of any type of oral<br>contraceptive and our estimate was<br>higher than expected from previously<br>reported incidents and case fatality<br>rates and we thought that this was might<br>partly reflect uh the extensive use of<br>Zealand now we had shared the findings<br>of our study with Med safe before uh the<br>paper was published so Med safe wrote to<br>New Zealand doctors midwives and<br>pharmacists at the time of<br>publication and it also took the<br>opportunity to counter um some Mis<br>misleading and accurate and inaccurate<br>claim that had been made in two<br>Publications and the first of these was<br>an article in the new ethical Journal<br>which was co-authored by a former Family<br>Planning Association spokeswoman and<br>this had been widely distributed to GPS<br>by a third generation pill<br>manufacturer and the second publication<br>was a letter to the New Zealand medical<br>journal by the College of Obstetricians<br>and<br>gynecologists now the publication that<br>our paper was followed by more media<br>coverage but despite all of this at the<br>end of 2000 third generation pills were<br>still being advertised to New Zealand<br>doctors quite quite<br>strongly and a few months later in March<br>of 2001 a news article in the British<br>medical journal the bmj revealed that a<br>manufacturer of third generation pearls<br>had failed to publish a study that had<br>produced unfavorable findings for their<br>product<br>and a few months later in July a<br>metaanalysis was published that included<br>studies that had directly compared the<br>risk of VTE and uses of third generation<br>pills versus Leo nestal pills and by<br>this stage I I should say that many more<br>studies had been published and in the<br>analysis that included all of the<br>eligible studies the odds ratio was<br>1.7 but interestingly when the analysis<br>was stratified by funding source the<br>odds ratio for industry funded studies<br>was quite a bit lower than the odds<br>ratio for non-industry funded<br>studies so that's the third well that's<br>all I'm going to say about the third<br>generation pill study uh story it was a<br>it was went on for a long time and it<br>was much more complicated than what I've<br>had time to talk about today but anyway<br>the very next year there were case<br>reports of VTE and uses of an oral<br>contraceptive containing a new proest<br>Esten called Dr perinone and you can see<br>two quotes here a concerned message from<br>an author of one of the original third<br>generation pill studies and a statement<br>by a manufacturer that it was absolutely<br>convinced of the safety of its new<br>pill and three years later we can see uh<br>two advertisements regarding the<br>introduction of Dr pan pills into New<br>Zealand but at this time there was still<br>a lack of information about where draw<br>parano pills uh whether these pills were<br>associated with a similar or higher risk<br>of VTE than Leo nestal<br>pills in 2007 two industry funded<br>studies were published that reported no<br>difference in Risk but if you look at<br>the methods very carefully at the<br>methods of these um studies and uh the<br>comparisons that were made the results<br>are not exactly<br>reassuring if we fast forward a couple<br>of years I was lucky to be on research<br>and study leave with Professor Susan J<br>at the Boston collaborative drug<br>surveillance program and we initiated a<br>study based on the UK GP research<br>database to investigate this issue and<br>Susan also initiated a second study that<br>was based on US Health Insurance<br>data and around the same time two<br>non-industry funded studies were<br>published which reported a higher risk<br>with draws panon pills<br>and our studies were published in April<br>of 2011 and we also found a higher risk<br>with draw parano<br>pills and in response to our papers The<br>Regulators in several countries issued<br>safety<br>advisories and here in New Zealand<br>medsafe reiterated advice that Leo<br>nestal pills were associated were<br>associated with the lowest risk of<br>VTE and at the end of 2011 three further<br>non-industry funded studies including<br>one that had been commissioned by the<br>FDA after our papers were published they<br>reported also reported a higher risk<br>with draws paranoid<br>pills and in mid December of that same<br>year a bmj news article reported that an<br>advisory committee to the FDA had voted<br>21 to5 in favor of strengthening the<br>labels on the draw Pano pills to include<br>more information about the Poss ibility<br>of the possibility of increased risk of<br>blood clots but that committee had<br>stopped short of recommending that the<br>label should warn that drw parano pills<br>were more likely than other pills to<br>cause<br>VTE Instead The Advisory Group suggested<br>that the labels say that the evidence<br>about blood clots is<br>conflicting and<br>then<br>um the following month a um news article<br>in um January reported that several<br>committee members who had cast votes had<br>Financial ties to draw parano pill<br>manufacturers and quite a bit must have<br>happened behind the scenes after this<br>because in April it was reported in the<br>bmj that the FDA was now requiring the<br>labels to of of draw panop pills to<br>state that they may cause as much as a<br>three-fold higher risk of blood clots<br>than other oral<br>contraceptives<br>it's also interesting to note that even<br>before this FDA advisory committee<br>episode concerns had also been raised<br>about Undeclared conflicts of interest<br>in clinical guidelines related to draw<br>parano<br>pills and one of the manufacturers of<br>these pills had also been required to<br>correct misle misleading advertising<br>about their<br>products now I've spent a lot of time<br>talking about oral contraceptives in VTE<br>because I think the story illustrates<br>the complexities of the drug Safety<br>Research environment and the first point<br>I'd like to make about this is that<br>knowledge<br>evolves and drugs of course as<br>pharmacologically active substances<br>inevitably have potential side effects<br>or harms as well as the desired<br>benefits and many harms especially those<br>that are rare or long-term or related to<br>exposure during<br>pregnancy uh won't be identified in the<br>premarketing clinic trials that form the<br>basis of the applications that<br>manufacturers make uh when they're<br>submitting an application to the<br>regulator when they want to get their<br>country and randomized control trials<br>are usually not an option to investigate<br>emerging safety concerns once drugs are<br>licensed and are being used in the<br>general<br>population they're not feasible for rear<br>or long uh long-term Harms and also it's<br>not ethical to randomly allocate people<br>to take an an exposure uh that you think<br>might be<br>harmful so that leaves us with um doing<br>case control or cohort studies which of<br>course come with methodological<br>challenges in terms of minimizing bias<br>and confounding as much as we<br>can now the second point I'd like to<br>make about the complexities of the drug<br>Safety Research environment is that it's<br>obviously important to consider the<br>balance of benefits and harms and the<br>level of harm that people are willing to<br>accept for a given benefit might differ<br>according to the severity and the<br>prognosis of the condition for which the<br>used and the final point I want to make<br>about the complexity of this sort of<br>research area is that as you've seen<br>there are often multiple interested<br>parties um there's the users of the<br>drugs and their family members there's<br>prescribers there's Health advocates<br>manufacturers The Regulators and also<br>sometimes<br>lawyers so to recap the first stream of<br>work related uh first stream of work in<br>my PhD related to oral contraceptives<br>and fatal PE and that led on to some<br>further research following my PhD and<br>just in case you're starting to worry<br>about being here all night I'm not going<br>to uh cover the other streams or<br>subsequent work in any great detail I<br>just want to give you a quick snapshot<br>of some of the other work I've been<br>involved<br>in and so the next stream of uh work for<br>my PhD involved psychotropic drugs in<br>fatal PE and this was prompted by a<br>study that had found an association<br>between current use of conventional<br>antipsychotic drugs and non-fatal VTE<br>but there was a lack of information<br>about the risk of fatal VTE and so I<br>carried out another national case<br>control study to examine the association<br>between the use of psychotropic drugs<br>and fatal pulmonary embolism<br>and the findings for psychotropic drugs<br>were consistent with studies of nonfatal<br>VTE but unexpectedly we found an<br>association between anti-depressant use<br>and fatal<br>PE and a question that's particular to<br>epidemiological studies of drug safety<br>is whether a potential association<br>between the use of a drug and an adverse<br>event is due to the drug itself or the<br>condition for which that drug is being<br>used<br>and several years later when I was on<br>research and study leave with um<br>Professor Dame Valerie Barrow at the<br>University of Oxford we explored this<br>question in relation to anti-depressants<br>and VTE using data from the Millian<br>women<br>study and a few years after that when I<br>was on um another research visit to<br>Oxford we carried out another study<br>related to psychotropic drugs and<br>depression and this time uh we were<br>looking to see whether an association<br>between depression and heart attacks<br>which had been reported in some studies<br>might be explained by the use of either<br>psychotropic drugs residual confounding<br>causation so coming back to my PhD again<br>uh the third national uh case control<br>study I completed looked at longdistance<br>air travel and fatal PE and ironically<br>unlike the oral contraceptive and<br>psychotropic drug studies I didn't need<br>to leave denan to do the study because<br>it inv involved telephone interviews<br>with NEX ofkin of cases and with<br>randomly selected controls from the same<br>region as cases and we did find an<br>elevated risk of fatal PE with<br>long-distance flights but the absolute<br>risk was reassuringly<br>low and I didn't pursue any further<br>research on this topic uh following my<br>PhD but I did explore other risk factors<br>for VTE with a million women's study<br>collaborators including uh looking at<br>body M body mass index and the risk with<br>VTE both in the absence of surgery and<br>following surgery and the same with<br>smoking both in the absence of surgery<br>and following<br>surgery and the final stream of work<br>that arose from my PhD was in response<br>to the logistical issues I encountered<br>in the oral contraceptive and<br>psychotropic drug<br>studies and the first of these was that<br>I had to do a lot of traveling and I<br>estimated that cumulatively I was<br>probably away from home for almost a<br>year and the second logistical issue was<br>um well the second challenge rather was<br>the hazards I encountered when searching<br>for records because some of the records<br>were stored in far from optimal um<br>conditions and at the time I was<br>collecting these data uh the Ministry of<br>Health had held several National Health<br>Data collections some of which you can<br>see on this slide and the ministry was<br>able to link information about<br>individual across most of these data<br>sets using an a unique patient<br>identifier the National Health index or<br>nhi however it wasn't possible to link<br>with uh link these data with information<br>about prescription drugs that had been<br>dispensed from pharmacies because nhis<br>were not recorded in the pharmaceutical<br>collection at that<br>time so as you can imagine I was very<br>excited when the ministry did start to<br>record nhis and the pharmaceutical<br>collection because this opened up huge<br>opportunities for sort of public good<br>research looking at drug utilization and<br>safety studies in a much more timely<br>fashion than had previously been<br>possible now researchers can request<br>data extracts from these um data<br>collections for specific projects<br>providing that they have ethical<br>approval uh for the project and that<br>they adhere to data protection and<br>privacy<br>legislation<br>but before we requested any data for<br>drug safety studies Charlotte and I<br>decided to organize a three-day citizens<br>jury to find out what an informed public<br>thought about the idea of using these<br>data for two purposes and the first of<br>these was to identify potential adverse<br>effects of drugs that were newly<br>introduced into New Zealand and the<br>second purpose was to investigate<br>emerging concerns about the adverse<br>effects of drugs that were currently<br>being used in New Zealand<br>and the jury unanimously uh supported<br>both types of activity provided that um<br>ethical guidelines were followed<br>relevant laws were adhered to and<br>privacy was<br>protected so we were then ready to carry<br>out some studies some drug safety<br>studies using these data and following<br>inut from a advisory committee we<br>decided to do two studies related to<br>issues that have been the subject of<br>recent Med safe warnings safety warnings<br>and the first study related to um a<br>question about a very widely used<br>cholesterol lowering drug called<br>simvastatin and whether the risk of a<br>potentially fatal condition called rdom<br>myolysis differed according to the doses<br>of sast that were recommended in the<br>cardiovas cardiovascular uh disease<br>prevention guidelines that were current<br>at that<br>time and the second study related to a<br>question about about um a widely used<br>group of drugs called proton pump<br>inhibitors or ppis and these are used to<br>treat or prevent uh gastric acid Related<br>Disorders and the question here was<br>whether these drugs increase the risk of<br>an acute kidney disorder called<br>interstitial<br>nefritis anyway we completed the sytin<br>study and that led on to further studies<br>with other researchers and two medical<br>students um Josh Quan and Finn sigal<br>call and these studies um investigated<br>other topical Staton related uh safety<br>and utilization<br>issues and for the PPI study Charlotte<br>and I were um had the Good Fortune to<br>supervise me blank um to undertake this<br>project for her masters of public health<br>degree and as with the SIM stattin study<br>the PPI study LED on to some further<br>research<br>now following the completion of the<br>first simus stattin study and PPI study<br>um in<br>2014 a small group of us were awarded um<br>some strategic initiative funding to<br>establish a pharmacoepidemiology<br>research Network and the current members<br>of the core academic group of the<br>network are shown here so Simon hbor um<br>Katrina sharles um Zer Donald Jimmy Zing<br>Dave<br>Michael tley Jack dummer and Karen<br>mcclinon and as well as carrying out<br>research and supervising students we<br>also run an annual Symposium which in<br>the last few years has been sponsored by<br>medsafe and pharmac and it's usually<br>attended by members staff from those<br>agencies as well as uh clinicians and<br>researchers and students and over the<br>years we've had keynote speakers from a<br>variety of countries including Canada<br>the US um Sweden Denmark the Netherlands<br>the UK and<br>Australia and as far as our research<br>goes some of our work has focused on the<br>drug treatment of two health conditions<br>of Public Health importance in New<br>Zealand chronic obstructive pulmonary<br>disease or COPD and type 2 diabetes and<br>some of our work has also focused on uh<br>the use and safety of drugs during<br>pregnancy now the first stream of work<br>came about came about when um Jack<br>dummer who's a respiratory physician<br>approached me with several questions<br>related to the treatment of people with<br>COPD including how well International<br>COPD prescribing guidelines were being<br>followed in New Zealand whether the use<br>of two long- acting Bronco dilated drugs<br>was associated with a higher risk of<br>heart attacks and unstable angina than<br>just than the use of just one drug it<br>was in the first study we did but we<br>were a bit concerned about the potential<br>for residual confounding because the<br>Ministry of Health data sets didn't have<br>information about all of the uh risk<br>factors for cardiovascular disease so we<br>formed a collaboration with uh Professor<br>Rod Jackson from the University of<br>Oakland and completed a study based on<br>his cardiovascular predict cohort which<br>has very detailed information about<br>cardiovascular risk factors and again we<br>found an<br>association and Josh Quan came back for<br>a second summer research experience and<br>we looked at where the people with COPD<br>received beta blockers as it's<br>recommended following uh an acute<br>coronary event um and also I was then<br>subsequently lucky enough to spend a few<br>weeks in Canada with Professor Tara<br>gones at the the Ontario drug policy<br>research Network and we looked to see<br>whether the introduction of combined<br>inhalers that included two long- acting<br>Bronco dilated drugs had led to an<br>overall increase and the use of two<br>Ontario as far as the type two diabetes<br>work goes we've carried out a series of<br>studies related to the use of Metformin<br>for type 2 diabetes including looking at<br>adherence uh patterns of discontinuation<br>and<br>reinitiation the experiences of people<br>taking<br>metformin and with another mid student<br>uh Joyce uh Gore we looked at treatment<br>pathways<br>and just moving on now to drugs and<br>pregnancy I mentioned earlier that uh<br>when we don't know a lot about the<br>safety of medicines in pregnancy when<br>drugs are first licensed for use in<br>general population and this is because<br>pregnant women are generally excluded<br>from the pre-marketing clinical trials<br>so I wondered whether the Ministry of<br>Health n National collections could be<br>used to investigate the utilization and<br>safety of drugs during<br>pregnancy and we were very fortunate to<br>recruit Sarah Donald uh who was just<br>finishing her Public Health Medicine<br>training to explore this and other<br>questions as part of her PhD and Sarah<br>was awarded a health research clinical<br>research training fellowship and she did<br>a huge amount of work with Dave Barson<br>our data manager to create the New<br>Zealand pregnancy cohort and linked baby<br>cohort and I'd just like to note that<br>because the Ministry of Health Data are<br>notle collected for specific research<br>purposes uh studies based on these data<br>are very data management<br>intensive but anyway the uh New Zealand<br>pregnancy cohort originally included<br>almost a million uh pregnancies<br>including early losses and after a<br>recent update it now includes about 1.5<br>million and the data from the pregnancy<br>cohort are linked to some of the other<br>um data sets that are held by the<br>Ministry of Health and the same for the<br>baby C<br>H so s has um using these this<br>information she's described the overall<br>patterns of various prescription drugs<br>in relation to pregnancy she's also<br>focused on drugs that have the potential<br>for fetal harm and she's also looked at<br>the patterns of anti-depressant<br>dispensing in relation to pregnancy um<br>and also examined uh the safety of<br>anti-depressants depressant use during<br>pregnancy<br>and the creation of the pregnancy cohort<br>has also led to other important public<br>health research such as this Masters<br>project uh by a Public Health Medicine<br>register Andrew SC Who's online as well<br>um which looked at whether women with<br>gestational diabetes are re are<br>receiving the recommended screening for<br>pregnancy and finally I just want to<br>give you a very quick snapshot of some<br>of our projects and several of these are<br>based on the New Zealand pregnancy<br>cohort and baby cohorts including a<br>project investigating the use and safety<br>of an anti-nausea drug called onanon um<br>and this drug was originally developed<br>to treat nausea and vomiting and people<br>receiving chemotherapy but it's<br>increasingly being used during pregnancy<br>even though it's not licensed for such<br>use Sarah and I also have some<br>International collaborations including<br>looking at the utilization and safety of<br>smoking sensation drugs in pregnancy the<br>use of prescription opioids in pregnancy<br>and the use of lithium and other<br>psychotropic drugs in<br>pregnancy and some of us are also<br>building on the work I did with the<br>Ontario drug policy research<br>Network so that's an overview of my<br>academic career to date and to return to<br>the braided River metaphor I'm hoping<br>that I still have some time to explore<br>yet more interesting research channels<br>before I encounter the pounding waves at<br>the river mouth and I'm just going to<br>finish off very quickly with some<br>acknowledgements and you can see that<br>there are so many people to thank but I<br>particularly want to thank David skig<br>and Charlotte Paul uh for inspiring me<br>to Embark upon a career in<br>epidemiology thanks also to the many<br>people and organizations who facilitated<br>access to the information that was<br>needed to undertake the various research<br>projects and also to the various funders<br>who've supported the<br>research and most of all my profound<br>thanks to my parents who made it<br>possible for me not only to finish<br>University<br>I'm sorry I'm Charlotte Paul I'm a<br>supervisor a colleague friend of lean's<br>um that was just wonderful thenan um I'm<br>honored to be invited to thank you I<br>felt it was absolutely the right balance<br>of the personal and the work so I'm<br>obviously one of the people who thought<br>she should say quite a lot about her<br>work um um I want to acknowledge<br>especially your father who you cared for<br>with such an open heart for so long and<br>who died earlier this year as did your<br>sister who's here tonight um the braided<br>River metaphor reminds me of the Robert<br>Frost poem The Road Not Taken You Took<br>The Road Less Traveled um that led to<br>pharmacoepidemiology but other roads<br>would have led to Classics Russian<br>literature um Marty or being a trade I<br>think um it led uh Professor parin uh as<br>it had for me to work with Professor<br>David skig whose sharp<br>mind very good judgment and unwavering<br>attention to the common good and to<br>details in big things um set Leanne on a<br>path to become the national leader in<br>research on the safety of<br>medicines Leanne is the founding lead<br>investigator of the national<br>pharmacoepidemiology research Network<br>and has fruitful International<br>collaborations around the world as you<br>he tonight in fact you've just been<br>doing such an amazing amount of work I<br>think it was a good thing I retired<br>quite a long time ago um uh and and and<br>gradually of course it came the Leanne<br>was was my teacher um while I continued<br>to work with her I looked up a<br>definition of what I want to call our<br>discipline and a simple one the study in<br>real condition conditions on large<br>populations of the use Effectiveness and<br>harms of<br>medicines and you're doing all those<br>things actually a lot of stuff on use as<br>well as looking at at um<br>harms as the use of medicines increases<br>so does the potential for iatrogenic<br>harm and this was well Illustrated in<br>the study of oral contraceptives and<br>deaths from formerly<br>embolism this confirmed the harm of<br>so-called third generation pools public<br>policy advice followed a rapid drop in<br>prescribing these pills and lives<br>saved though the way is really as simple<br>as Professor parken<br>outlined well actually you outlined some<br>of the difficulties as well um as it<br>being the straightforward thing um in my<br>experience um Professor Parkin has the<br>authority and calm demeanor to be able<br>to confront bad science and vested<br>interests and she has inspired many<br>others to do this work too so my task is<br>to thank you for a terrific lecture and<br>for the work you continue to do I'm<br>honored to give you this sorry I better<br>get it I'm honored give you the small<br>token of appreciation from the<br>University<br>thank right me again very briefly just<br>to um in a moment invite you all to uh<br>thank Leanne again and celebrate her um<br>professorial and her um work and longm<br>continue and then to um come over to the<br>staff club for some um Refreshments to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
