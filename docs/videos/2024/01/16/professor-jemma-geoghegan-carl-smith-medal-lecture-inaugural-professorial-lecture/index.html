the<br>people of this place<br>kah Kahu and give greetings to you all<br>um uh<br>to to the house that stands here may you<br>stand<br>forever and we may may we remember those<br>passed so I'm Professor Richard Blakey<br>Deputy Vice Chancellor research and<br>Enterprise and it's my great<br>uh privileged to be um here as MC and<br>welcome you you on this great occasion<br>having both an inaugural Prophet orial<br>lecture and the presentation of the Carl<br>Smith medal uh to Professor Jimma Gigan<br>tonight um Jimma has been very kind to<br>us and allowed both of those uh<br>occasions which have come up in the same<br>year for her to be combined so we've got<br>uh we're going to go through some<br>protocols that we will try and celebrate<br>traditions of both events simultaneously<br>and so there'll be quite a lot of up and<br>down from the stage we've got quite a<br>lot of things to present but I know<br>you're mainly here to hear um Professor<br>gigan's IPL and to a calsouth<br>lecture um so I just want to acknowledge<br>people that are here um acknowledge our<br>former Chancellor Professor Dr reyen<br>some some of all welcome I want to<br>acknowledge uh visitors to the<br>University from the Four Winds welcome<br>to those that are here in person here in<br>Denine tonight and those that are with<br>us virtually<br>now and possibly in the future watching<br>watching this event online or via<br>streaming to our academic party to our<br>vice Chancellor Helen Nicholson to<br>senior members of uh the University from<br>um across our divisions uh leadership<br>from the division of Health Sciences in<br>particular welcome to you all and um<br>welcome to other visitors um so this is<br>um this is an auspicious occasion this<br>is presentation of the roath trust award<br>and the ksmith medal to Professor G<br>Gan and<br>um<br>uh it's um oh I've just gone through<br>that it's it's my duty now to go through<br>the order order of proceedings um I'm<br>going to say some words mainly about the<br>carlsmith medal and the roath trust<br>award I'll tell you a little bit about<br>ipls and what make them special and then<br>we'll hand over to Professor Greg Cook<br>Jim as he Department to introduce her<br>following the lecture itself uh<br>Professor Neil gimal the deputy provis<br>ch for the division of Health Sciences<br>we'll summarize the significance give a<br>vote of thanks and then we'll do a<br>little bit of up and Downing with I<br>think there's something to recognize<br>Jim's professorial promotion then we'll<br>come up and I will invite the vice<br>Chancellor to present the carlsmith<br>medal and another very special gift that<br>goes alongside that and then we'll go<br>for a cup of tea over at the staff Club<br>so hopefully that's all going to be<br>clear but if we muck it up along the way<br>please forgive us CU we we're doing this<br>usually it's one one and one only<br>actually I forgot to acknowledge Alex is<br>here Jim's family and I believe that<br>there's some kids and maybe a grandma<br>online as well so I hope this is an<br>occasion for the whole family that we're<br>really really looking forward to uh<br>before we get into that I just want to<br>give you a little bit of background<br>because um why uh why KL Smith medal and<br>ha Ro Heath trust award the purpose of<br>these um which began in 2003 are award<br>and are always awarded together is very<br>clear they are to promote research at<br>the University of kago and give<br>recognition to an outst to outstanding<br>research performance of early career<br>staff which is for those who have been<br>inago for at least two years but have a<br>total research career appointment for<br>less than 10 years it is research<br>experience and not agent that is the<br>defining factor I think you can see with<br>Jim's promotion to professor at the same<br>time as as awarding of the medal the<br>standard is very high and what you're<br>going to see tonight I'm sure is uh some<br>things that many people would not<br>achieve in 10 or even 20 years of their<br>career so why an award and a medal well<br>one is for the money and one is for the<br>glory quite simply um the RO Heath trust<br>was established in 1964 to support the<br>work of of the University by Kyle Smith<br>a prominent denan businessman and member<br>of the University Council and um the<br>roath trust was used to endow a $5,000<br>research support award that bears the<br>trust name so that's the money uh at the<br>same time the university commission a<br>medal in sir cary's honor as the glory<br>to associ accompany the<br>money and it very it gives the<br>university a very good opportunity to<br>recognize the contribution so car and<br>wife lady Catherine made over many years<br>after coming to New Zealand from the<br>Family Estate of Ro Heath near<br>Birmingham so that's the connection the<br>family connection to the university and<br>the the award continues uh with the<br>Kyle's daughter Katherine um having<br>lived locally and being a regular<br>attendee at these Awards up until a few<br>years ago I also found there's another<br>indirect connection with our current<br>Chancellor not that he was a member of<br>the Smith family but his um Papa<br>also relates to family coming from um<br>near Birmingham as part of the Cadbury<br>schwips<br>Enterprise um so finally as something on<br>the side so Carl is a well-known author<br>not so much for his book Sweet Success<br>his history of the chocolate maker kbri<br>fry Hudson published in<br>1968 but for another book which is a<br>another prize that we have to award a<br>copy of which it's out of print but we<br>do try and keep get copies from the<br>secondhand book bookshops that he also<br>wrote a quirky and humorous T New<br>Zealand from n to zed that we will<br>present at the award as part of the<br>awards tonight so that's the kith medal<br>and Ro Heath trust award but also this<br>is to recognize professorial promotion<br>and professorial promotion at the<br>University of atago is a very rigorous<br>process where we require outstanding<br>performance and Leadership over a<br>sustained period in teaching research<br>and service and I think um we'll hear<br>about that from Professor cook but it's<br>a it's a bar that is very hard to cross<br>we get International referees to assess<br>every application and um and we're quite<br>rigorous in that assessment um I think<br>again you will see tonight that um<br>Professor gigan's performance has met<br>the standard very very admirably for her<br>promotion so please on behalf of the<br>University could we congratulate<br>Jimma on her promotion and her the<br>forthcoming Award of her medal as I<br>invite Professor Greg Cook up to give<br>her a more fome introduction<br>congratulations<br>Jimma thank very much Richard uh Oto<br>ctoa and a warm Pacific greetings to you<br>all<br>um my name is Greg Cook and I'm the head<br>of Department of microbiology and<br>Immunology and it is real my honor<br>tonight to actually to be able to<br>introduce Professor<br>Gigan um much has been written about you<br>Jimma um you're quite the the media star<br>but I was also going to say movie star<br>so I'll add some extra insight into your<br>long list of remarkable achievements so<br>Jimma got her BC honors um degree in<br>2009 first class honors from the<br>University of stth CED um came to the<br>University of otago where she did her<br>PhD under H Spencer I just saw him over<br>there so she finished her PhD in 2013 I<br>just checked four first author papers<br>from that thesis so a fantastic effort<br>and obviously a star was born right<br>there uh Jimma then went off to do<br>postdoctoral studies 5 years in total in<br>the US um landed at the University of<br>Sydney in the Charles Perkins Center um<br>so great postto there numerous papers<br>from that as well so everywhere you seem<br>to have touched down you've been a<br>winner uh you were appointed as a<br>lecturer in 2017 at the department of<br>biological sciences at mcari University<br>so from 2017 to 2020 uh Jimma was a<br>lecturer there so it was no surprise<br>when she turned up here that she was<br>already extremely experienced um as an<br>academic so she joined our department in<br>20120 as a senior lecturer um that<br>appointment process uh was combined with<br>an appointment at ESR so this was a a<br>really good model for our department to<br>actually have an academic that was<br>appointed through ESR and through the<br>University of tago and that's really<br>blossomed that relationship in<br>2021 uh Jimma was awarded a prestigious<br>ruford Discovery Fellowship along with<br>Mar and grants in 2023 she was promoted<br>to associate professor and I don't know<br>if there's any academic that's ever done<br>this but the same year that you were<br>promoted to a sociate professor in 2023<br>you actually became a<br>Professor so I don't I don't know how<br>payroll deals with that but anyway very<br>good day so so that was to the chair of<br>um viral pathogenesis which was endowed<br>by Rob Webster and his family um jma's<br>research focuses on evolutionary biology<br>and virology and we'll hear some of this<br>exciting research tonight um there have<br>been many highlights so I'm certainly<br>not going to stand here and read them<br>all out but everyone will know that GMA<br>was pretty instrumental in establishing<br>whole genome sequencing in the sasov<br>pandemic in New this was critical for<br>the successful Public Health response um<br>avoided multiple costly lockdowns of<br>Oakland so hopefully every time you go<br>up there they buy you a drink um Jim<br>worked very closely with the Prime<br>Minister just under adun and you know<br>really was hugely instrumental in um<br>combating that pandemic uh one of her<br>papers was a really was a world first in<br>this um inlight transmission of Co and<br>that's really helped to shape policy on<br>air travel and ongoing genomic<br>surveillance so not only is Jimma doing<br>worldclass research that's being<br>published in high impact journals her<br>research actually has real world impact<br>um not only is Gemma working in<br>infectious disease biomedical research<br>but she's also involved in Wildlife<br>Conservation uh where she has advised<br>Wildlife disease outbreaks and<br>conservation decisions and has a number<br>of PhD students working in this<br>area um so I'm just going to start to<br>get to jma's research output which is<br>just nominal um GMA has already brought<br>in $5 million of contestable funding to<br>the University of otago as a pi which<br>has involved MD funding HRC Mars and<br>rutherfords I mean some people are happy<br>if they get one of those in their career<br>you've already ticked them all in the<br>first few years you've been here um the<br>thing that blew me away today when I was<br>looking at your CV a bit further as I<br>see that you've got $30 million of extra<br>funding as an AI so um thank you Jimma<br>well done<br>in her and this this is also phenomenal<br>I know I keep saying this is phenomenal<br>but it really is when you start reading<br>this um 8 years post PhD so that's what<br>Jimma is Right including having two<br>amazing children um jimer has already<br>published over 60 papers already has an<br>H index of 32 greater than 3 and a half<br>thousand citations first author<br>contributions in nature review genetics<br>nature Communications nature Immunology<br>pnas uh jma's work has featured in all<br>major outputs such as New York Times<br>Washington Post the<br>guardian um thousand media stories Jimma<br>has contributed so just really prolific<br>not only in producing high impact papers<br>but also sharing that and communicating<br>that<br>information huge number of awards and<br>medals including the one tonight um many<br>highlights here I mean I think probably<br>the number one highlight is the prime<br>minister's MCD emerging scientist prize<br>in 2021 so congratulations that's an<br>absolutely outstanding achievement um<br>some prizes in Australia as well so not<br>only did she<br>achieve amazing things in Aussie she's<br>doing it here so everybody probably<br>thinks that Jim is a research staff so<br>probably doesn't do any teaching but<br>what I can tell you is that Jimma<br>teaches at every level of that<br>curriculum 100 level 200 level 300 level<br>400 level right so teaches right across<br>the C curriculum she also teaches into<br>the genetics program right so very<br>active in teaching as an H you're a<br>fantastic departmental citizen you know<br>I really appreciate that you always<br>contribute you always want to me<br>involved in the<br>conversation and before you start I just<br>want to thank Alex and your young family<br>and Grandma are online uh for sharing<br>Jimma with us and I hope this evening<br>will be a fitting celebration of what an<br>amazing academic Jimma is so<br>congratulations Jimma and looking<br>tonight<br>got so do you remember what you were<br>doing on New Year's Eve 2019 and where<br>you were well if you weren't Doom<br>scrolling Twitter like me you probably<br>weren't aware of what was about to erupt<br>there was a new virus outbreak that was<br>starting to emerge first in China then<br>it spread to neighbor countries it then<br>went to the US and Europe and pretty<br>much everywhere that was doing a test<br>for it could be detecting this virus so<br>then how did we get from what a field<br>was was largely just a blue skies<br>research that no one really cared that<br>much about I have to be honest to our<br>national and international leaders<br>talking about virus Evolution hey jinda<br>did say mutation<br>okay she did say that she did say<br>mutation once<br>and how did I a weird looking kid from<br>Scotland um pictured here with my<br>siblings and grandparents on the one<br>sunny day um ended up here literally<br>being annoyingly everywhere<br>and and you can really get away from it<br>so I'm from the UK specifically Scotland<br>and more specifically the kingdom of f<br>um where there is world class<br>Cuisines um CR crappy music and and this<br>really boring sport that was invented<br>there it is also home to um Scotland<br>secret bunker that was built during the<br>Cold War so um it's now open for tourism<br>because apparently we don't need a<br>secret<br>bunker so I've always been really<br>interested in evolutionary processes and<br>so when I left University in Glasgow I<br>wanted to travel as far away as possibly<br>can to study under a distinguished<br>Professor um hermer Spencer at the<br>University of atago and while inish are<br>in quite different fields now he's<br>taught me a lot about um how to be a<br>good scientist how to read and write and<br>how to be a good supervisor and more<br>importantly um he's setting trends for<br>the Next Generation Um in<br>fashion but all this Evolution Malarkey<br>takes a long time usually especially if<br>you have long long genomes like us it<br>takes lots of time to study Evolution so<br>when we look at things that have smaller<br>genomes like viruses we can study their<br>evolutionary processes um a lot faster<br>and I thought it was always sad that<br>Darwin never knew about viruses um so<br>you know they are the best examplars of<br>evolution by natural selection because<br>they evolve so rapidly that you can see<br>their evolutionary processes in real<br>time so speaking of bald dudes I um I<br>then I'm working on my Segways and then<br>um so I first uh moved to New York and<br>studied under um Scott braithway and he<br>introduced me to viruses um specifically<br>HIV and this is where my sort of<br>evolutionary background and his medical<br>background um really sort of first<br>merged and then I um quickly then moved<br>to um Australia and studied um under um<br>Professor Eddie Holmes who is the world<br>leading expert in virus Evolution and<br>he's been really instrumental into my<br>whole academic journey and I continue to<br>talk to him most days and collaborate<br>with him<br>closely and so let's just say that we<br>have this virus population where there<br>are small changes in this virus<br>population and just like we can infer<br>family relationships by drawing a a<br>family tree we can also infer how<br>viruses are related to each other by<br>also drawing a family tree from their<br>genomes such as a philogenetic tree and<br>we can study viruses at different scales<br>for example this could be a virus<br>species or we could um go broader across<br>virus families or orders or even Fila<br>and infer how these viruses are related<br>to each other and have a common<br>ancestor so we can do this at an<br>intrahost scale so when you're infected<br>with the virus it could be a 5-day covid<br>infection or it could be a lifelong HIV<br>infection but that virus is continually<br>to evolve and generate genetic variation<br>and we can study that in TR host we can<br>also study that at the population level<br>so we might generate virus genomes or<br>consensus genome um from each infected<br>individual and then infer how those um<br>people are are related to each other in<br>their transmission pathway and using<br>virus genomes we can then look at um<br>really important parameters for<br>infectious disease outbreaks such as AR<br>not or the rate of spread so we can do<br>that for um for particular clusters over<br>time and how perhaps that interventions<br>in Public Health may impact the rate of<br>spread and we can do this at a global<br>scale as well so a a virus that is<br>spread around the world for instance we<br>can use the virus genomes to then<br>understand how it's evolving and and<br>spreading through space and<br>time and until recently this has always<br>been a sort of retrospective study um<br>and but the same sorts of techniques<br>have been used and developed um to<br>better understand how viruses have<br>evolved so for example in the Ebola<br>outbreak um we found that just a single<br>amino acid change um in one of the virus<br>proteins could then change how the virus<br>was becoming better to infect cells and<br>humans and um and also more more causing<br>more severe<br>disease as well as working on things<br>like hand frot and mouth disease in in<br>Vietnam um with my collaborator tan lean<br>and we found um how different variants<br>were evolving and spreading and<br>replacing um previous<br>variants also um collaborated with um<br>people in the D Institute in Melbourne<br>for example to understand how flu a and<br>flu B can co-circulate um around<br>Australia and what drives um one or the<br>other to emerge each year as well as<br>looking at viruses in livestock for<br>example and seeing how seasonal um these<br>can be driven by seasonal<br>drivers so it doesn't matter what virus<br>it is or what host species it is the<br>same sorts of techniques can be<br>developed and so we can better<br>understand viruses How they've spread<br>through space and<br>time and these techniques can be used to<br>understand how a viruses evolve and<br>emerge in the first place so for example<br>emerging infectious diseases are<br>characterized by virus host jumping so<br>where a virus jumps from one host<br>species to infect a new host um species<br>and this is just luck whether or not it<br>results into an epidemic or just a<br>spillover event where no one actually<br>realizes but we we can quantify host<br>jumping for example if we study the<br>evolution of the hosts along with the<br>viruses we can then understand the<br>patterns of host jumping over the<br>evolutionary history of these viruses so<br>for example if the evolutionary history<br>of the virus and the host if these<br>perfectly match then we can infer that<br>these um viruses have evolved with their<br>hosts and they're speciated as the hosts<br>have speciated on the other hand if they<br>don't match then we can conclude that<br>the viruses has jumped to new<br>sometime over the evolutionary history<br>of those<br>viruses so we can do this for lots of<br>virus families and you can see lots of<br>squiggly lines here which means that<br>viruses just love to jump to new hosts<br>and that is their preferred way of<br>evolving um to different host and<br>speciating over<br>time but clearly it's not just host<br>jumping that drives emergence okay so<br>for instance Ebola virus was first<br>recognized about 5050 years ago and it<br>and zika virus was first recognized<br>about 70 years ago but these viruses<br>didn't cause their eruption and and<br>their epidemics um until about a decade<br>ago so why is that what makes a virus<br>cause an epidemic so I think it's<br>important then to understand the<br>differences between spillovers and<br>outbreaks so lots of viruses jump to<br>humans all the time um but they don't go<br>anywhere and most mostly we don't even<br>know about them so bird flu for example<br>um or highly pathogenic Avan influenza<br>virus has jumped many times especially<br>over the last few years from from Birds<br>into Maman hosts it's jumped lots of<br>times to humans and it kills about half<br>of those humans that it infects but<br>there is no evidence that this virus now<br>may change in future that um that goes<br>on to infect more humans or more animals<br>so it's not adapted to spread between<br>mammals yet on the other hand you have<br>outbreaks such as m Corona virus for<br>example which has jumped a few times<br>from Camels to humans and spreads<br>happily between those humans and kills<br>about 35% of them so we have these two<br>scenarios and so I guess the burning<br>question is can we predict if a virus is<br>going to emerge which Camp it's going to<br>fill in uh fall into well the answer is<br>kind of enough to get a paper in pnas<br>but not not enough to save the world<br>unfortunately and the reason is because<br>we know about 230 viruses that infect us<br>there's probably lot lots more that<br>aren't that aren't causing outbreak so<br>we don't know about them but um we kind<br>of have guessed it's really just a guess<br>the number of viruses that probably<br>exist on Earth and this guess kind of<br>comes from the number of ukar posts that<br>might be able to host these viruses on<br>Earth and so I mean we kind of really<br>made us number up but I think it's I<br>think it's kind of realistic um that<br>there may be this number of viruses<br>there so given the fact that we know<br>about so few viruses but there are<br>probably lots of viruses out there we we<br>probably don't have the right data to<br>try and predict stuff like um virus<br>emerging events and so what we need to<br>do is go virus hunting okay so we need<br>to understand the diversity of viruses<br>out there so that we can understand<br>patterns in virus disease emergence and<br>so virus hunting used to rely on um<br>techniques such as PCR but you kind of<br>needed to know what you're looking for<br>and so it wasn't really good for<br>discovering Noble things as well as<br>virus culture which definitely has its<br>place but it's not very good again at<br>discovering Noble things because you<br>kind of need to know what cells your<br>virus is going to grow into so using<br>Next Generation sequencing technique<br>called metagenomics we can then use this<br>to actually just sequence all the<br>viruses or all the genomes of the<br>viruses in a sample and we can also see<br>how much of the virus is there um so it<br>gives us lots of information about the<br>diversity of viruses and the abundance<br>in different hosts or different samples<br>and so we've used this technique um a<br>lot to study virus diversity in lots of<br>different um uh hosts including fish and<br>amphibians and fish and amphibians are<br>really interesting host to study because<br>they are more basil than us and so um<br>they have very interesting viruses and<br>these are seemingly healthy um hosts<br>that have lots and lots of viruses and<br>we can understand whether or not there<br>are viruses that um that are more<br>diverse in certain popul ations or<br>certain species and so this can range<br>from Simply going to the fish market for<br>example or um or actually taking fresh<br>samples another way to study viruses<br>that we've we've done in my lab is to um<br>is sample sort of predator and and pest<br>species to try and understand what<br>viruses they might carry and and<br>understand how the population densities<br>and rural areas versus Bush areas um<br>might change their their viral<br>diversity<br>other things are just because they're um<br>they're they're experiencing Wildlife<br>disease and um I'm working with the<br>Department of Conservation and others to<br>try and understand the causitive<br>pathogens that may be causing disease um<br>such as the hoiho and kakapo and other<br>host just because they're interesting um<br>such as the Tuatara or bats because um<br>bat species have have been known to<br>carry lots of viruses worldwide and we<br>have bets in New Zealand and other<br>species such as migratory birds and<br>senary birds just to try and understand<br>um virus transmission and perhaps infer<br>the risk of AI an influenza virus coming<br>to New<br>Zealand and I even built a drone to fly<br>through whale snot to sample snot to<br>sample<br>viruses<br>so again and again what we find really<br>interesting diversity of viruses but the<br>viruses that are in lower vertebrates<br>like fish and jawless fish and<br>amphibians are actually virus is that we<br>only thought infected mammals and so we<br>found things like Ebola virus an<br>influenza virus and Deni virus all of<br>their ancestors are always in um in our<br>ancestors which really broadens our view<br>of virology in the virus sphere and<br>tries to sort of put in perspective<br>virus causing sorry disease causing<br>viruses and so I was happily living on<br>the Northern beaches in Sydney and I was<br>working in um in the University of<br>Sydney's Charles Perkins Center this<br>fancy building here and um I got married<br>uh particularly nine years ago today so<br>happy<br>anniversary see I remembered and<br>um and then I got my first permanent<br>position um at mcor University where<br>there is an actual bear in the lobby of<br>the biological um School of biological<br>science called called Frank and then I<br>did my first genetic experiment and um<br>and we had our baby daughter um in 2019<br>now this timeline is important because<br>I've been accused in the past Mick Black<br>of um of fabricating the the um uh the<br>pandemic to just boost my H index but<br>that did not happen because when um<br>during 2019 I was on maternity leave and<br>for some reason I convinced ESR and um<br>the microbiology Department to give me a<br>job and um so in early 2020 we got on a<br>plane and we moved to New<br>Zealand and so it was um the the world<br>was alerted to a new um pandemic or what<br>was going to be a new pandemic on the<br>30th of December<br>2019 um if you were in the community of<br>infectious disease you were sent a memo<br>like this and it alerted to four cases<br>of an unexplained pneumonia at Wuhan<br>Central Hospital hospital um just 12<br>days later my um my former boss<br>colleague um Eddie Holmes posted on<br>Twitter which might go down as the most<br>important tweet in history where there<br>is a new Corona virus has been um has<br>been identified and not only that our<br>full Genome of this new virus has now<br>been shared online and this tweet will<br>basically um is important because the<br>because um basically all the vaccine<br>designs were based on this very genome<br>and so it allowed us to rapidly um<br>develop diagnostic tests and understand<br>um where the virus is coming from and so<br>this virus genome we could put it in a<br>philogenetic tree and understand what<br>was its closest genetic relatives and at<br>that point there was only two genetic<br>relatives that were very close one was<br>from a bat and one was from a Pengalin<br>um importantly these weren't the source<br>of this outbreak because there were<br>about 30 years of evolution that had to<br>occur between these viruses and the one<br>that had just emerged into humans of<br>course Corona viruses and humans is not<br>a new thing um we've had a couple of<br>pandemics in the past caused by Corona<br>viruses such as Zars 1 um that killed<br>about 800 people which emerged in 20 uh<br>2002 and of course Ms Corona virus which<br>emerged about a decade later um from<br>Camels and so it's not unusual that we<br>had a pandemic that was caused by a a<br>Corona virus but this one was new in<br>fact nine Corona viruses have emerged<br>into humans and seven of them have been<br>in the last 20 years so people were kind<br>of expecting<br>it in<br>fact where there's Corona viruses<br>everywhere and wherever there's a host<br>to host a Corona virus there is a Corona<br>virus and even in New Zealand New<br>Zealand has two species of bats the<br>Lesser short tail bat up there which is<br>the lease bat-like thing um and it<br>basically hangs out on the ground and<br>the longtail bat and these bats both<br>have Corona viruses um in New Zealand as<br>well and so for the first time during a<br>disease out break ever people were<br>sequencing virus genomes and sharing<br>them publicly online in real time with<br>allowed researchers around the world to<br>to do the same and also track and trace<br>this virus as it was spreading and its<br>Evolution and and this was used to adapt<br>our vaccines and to adapt strategies for<br>public health control as well so there<br>are lots of variants um I'm not going to<br>play the whole thing um so during the<br>disease during the pandemic in New<br>Zealand you know we largely had this<br>approach which where we think government<br>kind of listened to scientists and it it<br>ended up pretty well but during it I can<br>say that it kind of felt like this we<br>were kind of we had no idea what we were<br>doing and we were find building the<br>plane as um as we were flying it and<br>mainly it's because we had this really<br>out ofd or not fit for purpose um<br>pandemic plan and we really had to start<br>from scratch in New Zealand and<br>everywhere<br>else and so our pandemic looked like<br>this in New Zealand where we'd had this<br>big peak at the start and then in<br>between um we kind of had a few leaks<br>from from the miq as well as um as miq<br>cases uh stopped at the border and then<br>of course we had some bumps along the<br>way um the emergence of Delta followed<br>by Omicron and which really changed the<br>course of the pandemic for us but at the<br>very start on the 28th of February um<br>2020 we had our first case and my<br>colleagues ESR sequence the virus genome<br>and we went to the government and said<br>hey can you fund our genomics sequencing<br>project please cuz we think it can be<br>important and they said you already have<br>more and so during uh International<br>emergency we had to apply for<br>competitive funding um and I can tell<br>you no one really wanted to fund it but<br>if it wasn't for genomics at as well as<br>a science adviser in mb um thanks heish<br>um<br>uh MBI finally agreed to give us some<br>money to fund this project and this<br>project was led by myself as well as hup<br>D in here um from ESR and he um has<br>sadly left ESR now but um as well as<br>unar Ren who really is the person that<br>was up all night doing sequencing when<br>when we actually needed rapid results um<br>James Hatfield who is um a phenetics<br>expert um that lives in monah as well as<br>professor professor Nigel French from<br>Massie um David Welch and Jordan Douglas<br>from University of ockland as well as<br>later um Mike buns and David winter who<br>a lot of you will know um came on didn't<br>join ESR a we a we bit later so during<br>that first wave we had um so this<br>timeline Is 2020 where we had um a<br>really strict lockdown about um at the<br>end of March but this is a philogenetic<br>tree that shows all the cases that we<br>sequenced during that time and all the<br>colored dots are sequences from New<br>Zealand and all the gray dots are<br>sequences from elsewhere and what we<br>found was that New Zealand had pretty<br>much every variant that was circulating<br>around the globe at the time um came<br>into New Zealand and we had about 300<br>different importations prior to lockdown<br>so we had a lot of imports they went<br>everywhere and we had lots of genetic<br>diversity which meant lockdown was a<br>really smart<br>decision we also had um clusters that we<br>could identify for example the um you've<br>probably all heard of the bluff wedding<br>cluster which kind of got famous it was<br>the biggest cluster that we had at that<br>time it was due to a wedding prior to<br>lockdown and using these um genomes from<br>specific clusters we could infer things<br>like the um reproductive rate or the<br>transmission rate so we could understand<br>what effects that lockdown for example<br>we having on this transmission and so we<br>found um for this in particular cluster<br>this um this cluster had an AR note of<br>seven that means that one person on<br>average infects seven other people so<br>that is really high and then two weeks<br>after lockdown this went to zero so<br>lockdown was very<br>effective we also could trace um the<br>evolution of the virus um and contribute<br>that knowledge globally as well so for<br>example it was noted around the world at<br>that time that um our first variant um<br>now we're used to the word variant but<br>the first variant was starting to emerge<br>and for example the one single mutation<br>in a spike protein<br>changed the way the virus was infecting<br>us and increased the viral load and so<br>made us more contagious basically and so<br>we found that um in New Zealand we had<br>the same evolution of the virus where<br>more importation events came coming to<br>New Zealand had this new variant and we<br>were tracking that as well and so um<br>when we basically eliminated covid-19 in<br>the community we were um<br>effectively looking at any importation<br>events sorry any incursion events into<br>the community to understand how they<br>were related to The Border everything<br>had to be related to The Border<br>otherwise it would result in a national<br>lockdown and so every time we had a case<br>in the community we would sequence The<br>genome within about 6 hours and then um<br>be able to communicate that with um with<br>the government to to make those<br>decisions importantly lots of these<br>outbreaks happened about the same time<br>and so it was important to to assign<br>cases to different clusters because<br>otherwise contact tracing would just<br>would just fail um because there would<br>be no epidemiological<br>link and so we had a lot of time in our<br>hands during this um this time so when<br>when um things happened like Airlines<br>and um authorities used to put out um<br>ridiculous messages like you can't get<br>covid on a plane things like that we<br>obviously had the perfect situation in<br>New Zealand where everyone that was<br>coming into New Zealand went into miq<br>and was tested a few times and so we<br>knew that this this wasn't wasn't<br>correct and so for example this is one<br>of the examples but there's lots of lots<br>of them where seven people from around<br>the world all went to Dubai and then got<br>on the same flight from Dubai to ockland<br>and we found that um during that flight<br>they all infected each other and so um<br>we could say that you know um the<br>ridiculous messaging put putting out by<br>Authority Airline authorities and and<br>different airlines were was completely<br>um not based on reality um but that was<br>because the who was really putting out<br>um strange messaging at that time it<br>took them about two years to to admit<br>they were wrong but they were basically<br>saying that covid-19 was an Airborne and<br>so they were really not promoting the<br>use of masks and instead telling you to<br>wash surfaces um and so it led our<br>government to then put out false<br>messages for example where you can get<br>covid-19 on a rubbish bin um which<br>wasn't true either and in fact we um Pro<br>proved proved quite a lot of times that<br>um aerosol transmission was the primary<br>route of covid-19 because um we had<br>again this perfect experiment where we<br>had people coming into miq we had CCTV<br>and we knew the status of of where they<br>were at all<br>times I mean I mean their um health<br>status so do you do you remember that<br>you remember this headline for example<br>where a man had been in um miq for 14<br>days with two negative tests and then<br>later a week later in the community test<br>positive well we'll call this man G and<br>on the same day his household contacts<br>also tested positive hni but this person<br>using genomics was linked to a 9 person<br>chain of transmission that went all the<br>way back to India so what happened was a<br>and C get on a flight from MBI in to<br>Christ Church and then A and B test<br>positive on arrival and then get moved<br>to the isolation section of the hotel<br>and then um C didn't test positive until<br>day 12 but um which this kind of<br>indicates that they likely got it on the<br>way um on the flight from A and B but C<br>was in an adjacent room to cases d and e<br>and um on day 12 they got tested and<br>what happens and we've watched CCTV so<br>we know this is that the nurse knocks on<br>C's door and C opens up and steps out<br>into the unventilated corridor in the<br>hotel is swabbed by the nurse and then<br>and then steps back in and closes the<br>door and then a minute later D and E do<br>the same thing and so they're never in<br>the same place at the same time and<br>there's nothing connecting their rooms<br>and um there's a net positive air<br>pressure inside the room so when you<br>open open the door everything flows out<br>including aerosol virus and then so d<br>and e become infected on day 12 but<br>don't know about it because they're test<br>negative and then they go on a plane and<br>sit behind um case G and both of these<br>cases go on and infect their whole<br>entire households so this um wouldn't be<br>possible without virus genomics first of<br>all we can can link this whole chain of<br>transmission just to one incursion and<br>also infer the direction of transmission<br>from the looking at the different<br>mutations that have<br>Arisen and so we've effectively Comm um<br>eliminated covid-19 the community until<br>we had one case um and lockdown and the<br>and international news media love to<br>make a big deal about this but it wasn't<br>just one case because we knew using<br>genomics that we couldn't link it to um<br>well we could link it to Crown uh the<br>crown PL but there was no<br>epidemiological link there was no way<br>that the cases we were detecting in<br>community were in contact with the<br>genomes the virus genomes that were<br>matching from the Crown Plaza so we knew<br>that the country had to lock down so we<br>did have our second lockdown and this is<br>what the Delta outbreak looked like so<br>these lots of little dots on this tree<br>um correspond to the colors on the map<br>and so these were lots of cases mainly<br>located in ockland and you can see that<br>this line here represents our homegrown<br>variant um this represents just a 10 Del<br>10 base pair deletion in the in the<br>virus genome this actually became really<br>important because it was really easy<br>then to link cases to this cluster<br>because they had this um homegrown<br>variant as well as these orange dots<br>here for example represent cases in W<br>and we can see that there was just one<br>incursion or most cases were linked to<br>this one incursion from ockland into<br>that region but Northland on the other<br>hand lots of lots of in introductions<br>into North from<br>ockland and importantly we had these<br>long branches on the tree which meant<br>that um these clusters looked to go<br>extinct but then would just reappear<br>Weeks Later which meant that there was<br>lots of undetected Community<br>transmission and contact racing was no<br>longer working and this is when it<br>really broke<br>down and during this time<br>internationally there was a new variant<br>emerging and spreading and this was<br>called Omicron and this was is the still<br>the variant that circulates just now and<br>so you can see this really Long Branch<br>going to omon this means that it's<br>really really different from what we've<br>experienced in the<br>past and so quickly um soon after then<br>New Zealand got its first omong cases<br>and it spread very rapidly and really<br>changed the course of the pandemic for<br>us and unlike other countries around the<br>world New Zealand got two um Omicron<br>variants at about the same time ba1 and<br>ba2 but most of these cases could<br>actually just be linked to two super<br>spreading events in the early 2020 to so<br>a soundsplash event and a wedding and<br>most other cases actually appear to know<br>to go nowhere so this really changed the<br>pandemic and genomics was playing an<br>important role of of surveillance but<br>not many people were getting a PCR test<br>at this point and so it was time to<br>relax and um and not really um and<br>genomics as we continue to do it but<br>it's not as time crucial as as it was<br>before so while I was relaxing I had<br>another child um and it's impossible in<br>this job to take parental leave really<br>but um if it wasn't for my research<br>laboratory group my research group um my<br>staff and students they um I really kept<br>things going um when I did take some<br>days or some hours off leave um and and<br>so it was really down to them and I owe<br>a lot to them to um for continuing to<br>work really really hard uh and these are<br>just my present students and staff so<br>there's been a lot in the past as well<br>and across the university there's too<br>many people to thank really um that have<br>been that have shown me really a lot of<br>support um these are just some that um<br>I'm not just put you up there because<br>you're my boss but um they're really<br>really um have you know been a ear to<br>winde to or to um offered me really<br>really good advice um along the way<br>especially to Greg Cook who gave me a<br>job um and the there wasn't a job to<br>apply for but I but you already but you<br>gave me a job anyway um which was quite<br>amazing and thanks to the whole<br>department actually and um despite what<br>my son looks like in this photo they're<br>actually very nice and<br>um a huge thanks to the administrative<br>staff um the research office and the lab<br>managers really we couldn't do our jobs<br>without you and so I'll just leave with<br>this final thought is that no one really<br>cared about virus Evolution and<br>certainly we didn't think like a phog<br>gentic tree would um would go on to<br>inform policy that might save lives and<br>while we're thinking about setting our<br>research agendas and strategies let's<br>just remember that it can start with<br>building a drone to F fly through whale<br>snot or it could be sampling fish in the<br>middle of the night from a fish market<br>and we never really know where it's<br>you<br>keep going if you<br>like come on ten called Neil gimel to so<br>I'm Neil gimel I'm the acting Deputy<br>proce Chancellor for Health Sciences um<br>which is quite the mouthful uh that's<br>quite the act to follow uh I'll try to<br>summarize as best I can so my role is to<br>um summarize the lecture and give a vote<br>of thanks um so I had make a few notes<br>as you'll uh be aware because I think my<br>picture turned up somewhere towards the<br>end there I've known Jimma for a while<br>and it's been an absolute Delight to<br>follow her success U as she has<br>progressed through her career um I knew<br>relatively early on that you were a<br>winner and you have shown that um many<br>many times and many folds over so<br>congratulations I want to thank you for<br>your award lecture and your IPO lecture<br>I want to congratulate you on your 9th<br>wedding anniversary Alex have you got<br>the gift apparently it's um traditional<br>uh for either Willow or Pottery thank<br>you Google um I hope you've uh made<br>appropriate<br>arrangements um so we've learned tonight<br>about viruses as models of evolution um<br>it's an academically interesting Pursuit<br>I have to disagree that people that<br>worked on measles and flu before covid<br>uh think that evolution of virus is<br>actually pretty important um<br>but it's also profoundly important for<br>human animal and plant health and I<br>think we have come to recognize that um<br>uh very in a very personal way over the<br>last few years um Jim has given us<br>multiple examples of her expertise her<br>contributions both scientifically and to<br>society and the impact of her work um<br>and most notably I think through the<br>ongoing Co pandemic and of course cases<br>are actually spiking at the moment so<br>you know there we go it's not over yet<br>I think it is ironic uh to listen to<br>Jim's talk I'm a geneticist so all this<br>stuff's like oh yeah tell me more uh but<br>for some of you perhaps the words and<br>the language that we now common place<br>within uh our community that were once<br>the domain of a very specific<br>subdiscipline of science um is actually<br>perhaps the most profound impact of the<br>work that jimer and others have done I<br>think uh it speaks yeah you know just<br>the fact that we know what a clay is<br>that the Prime Minister knows what a<br>clay is I don't believe that um Donald<br>Trump ever used basing inference um uh I<br>I'm just going to go out on a limb that<br>that that that's a that's a fallacy<br>Boris Johnson perhaps um but I don't<br>think Donald Trump<br>did um I think we've all been<br>appreciative of jma's insid as Guide to<br>the covid pandemic and the work that she<br>did and for the role that she and others<br>helped in playing um helping help<br>helping to inform our government so that<br>we actually stayed safer than in many<br>countries around the<br>world uh we learned about why it's<br>important to investigate the sources and<br>patterns of spread of viruses through<br>space and time and the value of virus<br>hunting of various things including uh<br>fishes and uh and a whole swag of other<br>things uh which are useful for helping<br>us to predict the lightly impacts of<br>these diseases on their hosts and from<br>that to make some inference about how<br>they may impact on human health but also<br>Animal Health um she challenged us with<br>this idea that could we predict future<br>pandemics um and despite the fact she<br>has very nice paper on this in Pas I'm<br>going to say no um I don't think not I<br>don't think we can yet but I think as we<br>gain more and more information on the<br>virus's presence across the globe that<br>ability will steadily increase and we've<br>seen profound increases in the amount of<br>information and knowledge we have on<br>viruses globally over the last three<br>years last few years um and of course um<br>jma's workers leading in that area<br>within aara New Zealand and globally so<br>I thank you Jimma for your past work and<br>I remain excited for the new insights<br>that will be gained from the work that<br>you're doing now with us and the work<br>that you will do in the future with your<br>students finally on behalf of the<br>University our division and Patricia PRI<br>sense her regrets that she can't be here<br>I want to congratulate you on your<br>promotion and on the delivery of a<br>fantastic IPL which also happens to be a<br>kle Smith and roath um award um<br>lecture so I have one further small duty<br>to perform which is to give you this<br>gift which is a gift in recognition of<br>congratulations and now I'm going to<br>hand over to Professor Blakey for the<br>final parts of this<br>evening Cur uh thank you professor giml<br>well I'll now do a little bit of setup<br>setup um I did some setup on this one<br>time and the box broke so uh we'll just<br>have to make sure good haven't broken<br>the box and we have the book there uh<br>what I didn't say Jimma was that uh as<br>well as being a celebration uh we are in<br>examination period so this is also a<br>test and so the test was one for you uh<br>the audience to be the examiners of as<br>to whether you have<br>um passed with that presentation the<br>Criterion that uh that you have<br>demonstrated research that will that you<br>have demonstrated activity that will<br>promote research at the University of<br>atago and give recognition to<br>outstanding research performance by an<br>early career staff member so please by<br>acclamation determine whether or not we<br>tonight<br>good we do have a photography here is<br>that correct okay okay well look um now<br>my simple duty is to invite the vice<br>Chancellor up to present with you with<br>the kith medal and a uh a copy of New<br>Zealand from n to Z if you want to<br>say no come on<br>out um I think an amazing lecture thank<br>you Gemma and thank you you really are a<br>star and we're so lucky to have you with<br>congratulations so per just wait behind<br>and we'll get another couple of photos<br>before the uh for the scrap book after<br>we uh after we break but<br>that is all for the evening thank you<br>very much it's now my great pleasure to<br>invite all guests present uh to retire<br>to the staff club for some conversation<br>and refreshments thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
