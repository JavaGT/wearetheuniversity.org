Al and from<br>across the globe viewing these<br>proceedings via our live stream I would<br>now like to introduce to you the<br>chancellor of tting aaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington this is a role<br>that dates back to the Middle Ages when<br>the first universities were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the university strategic<br>Direction ladies and gentlemen the<br>chancellor John<br>ewi<br>tenoten to it's great to be here it's<br>great to be with you and it's great to<br>be celebrating so remember this is a<br>celebration yes there are formalities<br>yes we're dressing up yes we're having<br>trumpet voluntaries but this is<br>primarily a celebration for our<br>graduates<br>of our graduates and of the people who<br>have supported them so what I want to<br>say to you first is congratulations on<br>your achievement congratulations on the<br>effort that you've put into your<br>achievement and congratulations on<br>completing your degrees it's a fantastic<br>result it will transform your lives and<br>we are delighted for you can I recognize<br>all of your friends family Foo who have<br>gathered here to support you because you<br>know and I know that you can't do this<br>alone that it requires lots and lots of<br>help so you're all welcome too can I<br>recognize the brains trust behind me our<br>academic uh Community who are the<br>university along with our professional<br>staff and have provided leadership<br>provocation support and no doubt an<br>occasional shove uh as you've gone<br>through uh your journey of study I want<br>to recognize that this University in its<br>students in its academics in its<br>professional staff<br>is a remarkable institution that can<br>transform lives and in my view transform<br>this country and transform the world now<br>I know that not everyone holds that view<br>I know that some people walking in here<br>would be thinking good grief I've got<br>back into a medieval sort of construct<br>and when they hear uh rnia saying that<br>the chancellor was medieval uh which<br>probably was confirmed when I got up uh<br>they uh they would be thinking that<br>universities are infect as they thought<br>completely out of touch with modern<br>reality that of course is a fundamental<br>mistake yes we stand in thousands and<br>thousands of years of learning yes we<br>stand in thousands and thousands of<br>years of lived uh experience of multiple<br>Traditions from every culture and corner<br>of our globe and all of that is locked<br>in the heads of the people behind me<br>which means well anyway anyway they've<br>got large hats uh and but the really<br>exciting thing about a university is<br>that every year a new generation of<br>students turns up with their<br>contemporary issues with their<br>contemporary values with their desire to<br>change the world and they Collide well<br>you know meld uh gracefully with that uh<br>Heritage that is coming uh from our<br>academic community and it's there that<br>the Alchemy of a university exists it's<br>there that the magic um is created so I<br>want to say to you that universities<br>matter and that this is as much as well<br>it is a celebration of you is a<br>recognition of the importance of<br>universities a recognition of the<br>importance of expertise cuz I know that<br>there are heaps of people who think that<br>experts probably are oldfashioned you<br>don't need experts anymore cuz we've got<br>Google I don't need experts anymore<br>because I've got my own opinions and I<br>can tweak them out to anyone around the<br>world my reckons are as good as anyone's<br>reckons and I know that there are people<br>with with that view but you will not<br>address the fundamental challenges of<br>our planet and of our time with reckons<br>from Twitter you will not and the people<br>I want to recognize down here our people<br>with our phds who are about to be<br>awarded phds who've spent years and<br>years and years mastering and<br>understanding their particular<br>discipline and I want to recognize that<br>that knowledge matters that that<br>knowledge is valuable and that that<br>knowledge is fundamental to addressing<br>the challenges of our planet I know that<br>there are many people who think that<br>universities are stuffy old academics in<br>large offices doing oldfashioned sort of<br>stuff they're not stuffy some of them<br>are quite experienced but they are not<br>stuffy that this is a community which is<br>constantly questioning which is<br>constantly debating which is constantly<br>advocating which is constantly looking<br>for the new and understanding the new in<br>the context of the old and all that has<br>been delivered to them it's a constant<br>ferment a constant recognition that<br>we've got to ask uh questions of<br>ourselves and a constant recognition<br>that there are always doubts in fact one<br>of the very famous um uh academics of<br>this University Peter MTZ who was a<br>medieval historian uh described the<br>context of a university or the<br>fundamental of a university as being the<br>certainty of Doubt uh which I quite like<br>now I thought a bit of poetry CU this is<br>a fhss sort of group with education uh<br>so I thought that this will be deeply<br>poetic this audience so I thought well<br>let's let's have a little bit of poetry<br>just to sort of get the get the cor<br>pusles going and I thought i' I'd use a<br>poem A New Zealand part uh called the uh<br>uh fear of change and it goes something<br>like this I don't always get it right<br>imagine you or I awoken by the drums of<br>revolution in the street or suppose the<br>door flew open and there stood a young<br>bull fighter with a skin of rough red<br>wine offering us all death sex hope or<br>even an earthquake causing the roofs to<br>Rattle the trees to shake calling us all<br>loudly to consider God let us admit with<br>no shame whatever we are not that sort<br>of people we have leared to weigh our<br>words like ounces of butter our skills<br>are for anger and monotony therefore we<br>will survive the singers the dancers the<br>starcross lovers will bury them all and<br>spend a long wet weekend arguing whether<br>the corpses were dressed in red or black<br>now I love that I love that because I'm<br>keep imagining what the hell would I do<br>if a bull fighter turned up at the door<br>how would I confront the change and<br>challenge of that bull fighter and<br>that's exactly what our academics feel<br>like every year as the new as the new<br>community come in what are they going to<br>bring what what what are they going to<br>unlock in our community I love the idea<br>that it's the singers and the dancers<br>who are driving the change because in my<br>view singing dancing the Arts the<br>humanities are fundamental not just to<br>this University but fundamental to our<br>addressing the issues which confront us<br>as a nation and a world it's only music<br>can bring us together in a particular<br>way it's only theater and reading and<br>literature that can confront us in a<br>particular way it's only the visual arts<br>you walk into the Puppeteer campus and<br>tell me that you can look at that great<br>McAn I am and not be moved and not think<br>differently about this country and its<br>landscape its history and its future you<br>tell me that you can read The Iliad and<br>not be thinking thoughtfully about the<br>wisdom and mistakes of War now some of<br>you will immediately say haven't read<br>The Iliad not going to read The Iliad<br>The Iliad is out of date The Iliad I can<br>tell you is well worth the read there's<br>a new translation Emily Wilson that's<br>just out at the moment let me just give<br>you the first verses of The Iliad poem<br>written 8 8th Century BC so that's quite<br>a few years<br>ago so in in Emily's translation the<br>first verse says sing Oh goddess goddess<br>of the cataclysmic wroth of Achilles son<br>of pelus which caused the Greeks<br>immeasurable pain and sent so many noble<br>Souls of Heroes to Hades and made men<br>The Spoils of dogs and a banquet for the<br>birds and that's just chap that's just<br>verse one and there's quite a few books<br>it tells the story of War it tells the<br>story of the miseries of War it tells<br>the story of mistakes of pride pride of<br>ignorance it tells the story of<br>capricious Gods it tells the story of<br>contemporary times and you should read<br>it and the history of our country the<br>history of our world should be read<br>should be understood and if it was read<br>and understood in a deliberate way we<br>would not confront many of the Great<br>challenges that are currently testing us<br>you know there's another little this<br>isn't a whole poem so don't worry about<br>it but but um Charles Brash who's one of<br>my great uh Heroes who who was the<br>founder of landfall and was a New<br>Zealand poet uh remarkable man he wrote<br>a poem at the uh on the death of Robin<br>Hyde who was one of our favor famous<br>poets and writers and she said this he<br>said this of her by choice you stood<br>always on disputed ground at the utmost<br>edge of life and thinking about that I<br>was thinking a university actually<br>fundamentally stands in the same way we<br>stand on disputed ground and I don't<br>simply mean that this is contested with<br>Nati or atiawa I mean that we stand in a<br>space where we want to address the<br>fundamental issues of the day and I love<br>the theater of the march today where we<br>were marching between people protesting<br>various views of the uh challenging War<br>the disastrous War uh that is currently<br>going on in the Middle East in Palestine<br>uh and there was the University in the<br>middle of it and in my view the<br>university can be and should be in the<br>middle of these public conversations we<br>can bring our history the history of our<br>country the history of our world we can<br>bring our understanding of people and<br>the Deep Faith communities that have<br>driven the world for so many years we<br>can bring the sociology that we<br>understand of how communities actually<br>work we can bring all of our knowledge<br>to bear on these issues and here's the<br>thing we've got a secret Source when we<br>address these issues it's called<br>academic freedom and it's found it's a<br>statute it's a law that says we have<br>academic freedom you as students have<br>academic freedom and academic freedom<br>allows us to do a few things it allows<br>us to test received wisdom it allows us<br>to come up with new ideas and it allows<br>us to State opinions which are<br>controversial in our discussion of those<br>ideas so we're not just some dusty doing<br>thinking this is an active place an<br>activist place that is looking to change<br>the country and change the world and<br>here's the thing education and the Arts<br>are key enablers of that change and I've<br>already talked to you about the pipeta<br>campus in the Macan but if you don't<br>believe me read Tata AIA and her poetry<br>and about the impact of colonization in<br>the Pacific and if that doesn't unsettle<br>you nothing will but as tusaa sees in<br>her latest book of poetry no white<br>people were harmed in making this book<br>which I really liked uh G gave me great<br>confidence to read the second<br>page or if you watch a play by Victor<br>Roger or you look at that play that was<br>out here just recently primy that dealt<br>with sex um you know sex issues in the<br>courts you can see how the Arts can<br>challenge can prod can change things and<br>so so in my view the skills that we are<br>recognizing today the degrees that we<br>are recognizing today in education and<br>in the Arts and in anthropology and in<br>history these are the skills that are<br>going to be necessary to bring the world<br>together to bring the country together<br>and to take us forward so I'm don't<br>suppose I'm asking too much of you I<br>just want you to do all that reasonably<br>quickly cuz it's feeling somewhat uneasy<br>in my sort of to my senses at the moment<br>in the meantime we're going to have a<br>party you're going to have fun uh and<br>we're going to celebrate as only an<br>artistic positive forward-looking and<br>magnificently engaged University can do<br>we're proud of you we're proud of your<br>your success

day<br>of acknowledgement and<br>celebrations uh thank you to uh T aaka<br>Victoria University for this TR this uh<br>opportunity to speak on behalf of my<br>fellow graduates it's a real privilege<br>and honor and I'm very<br>grateful uh when I received the uh<br>invitation a month ago I felt nothing<br>but truly blessed uh to cour at or on<br>behalf of our um graduates um about our<br>achievements however was also an<br>opportunity to also Flex I mean<br>demonstrate my uh public speaking skills<br>so to those who nominated me it truly<br>lot congratulations to everyone of our<br>fellow graduates who are here<br>today Embrace this day which I know we<br>will always remember is a significant<br>Milestone and I know will be entrenched<br>in our memories and those of our<br>supporters today is also a day where we<br>get to reflect on our<br>journey the pursuit of knowledge and our<br>chosen disciplines or I like to say<br>passion the reason why we all sitting<br>here today is because we've done<br>everything possible to get here through<br>our dedication Mahi and sacrifice we<br>have confronted the challenge and we<br>have won the fight whether it took three<br>4 12 years we've gone all the way<br>so be proud of uh what you have achieved<br>Almighty<br>py looking back at uh the structure of<br>the trimester I always thought was<br>interesting from my first day and I'm<br>sure a lot of you will agree looking at<br>um the way the trimester is made up it's<br>uh 12<br>weeks um imp pugilistic terms is 12<br>rounds 12 rounds of fight challenge and<br>and all the hard stuff but all I know is<br>that we've all been committed that's the<br>reason why we're here for<br>example you got to start off with the<br>ding-ding you have weeks one to four<br>which are the kind of like the Fout<br>rounds and you know the opening rounds<br>it's all about the introductions the<br>course information the who's who and how<br>to navigate around campus then we move<br>on to weeks 5 to9 which are pretty much<br>the middle rounds the intensity sets in<br>you s test essays are written and you<br>work on the body um and when I say body<br>I mean body paragraphs I definitely<br>don't miss those a good boxing coach<br>would always instruct it's time to work<br>work their body and everything will fall<br>into place such as the introduction and<br>conclusions I won't miss that<br>either then finally we move on to weeks<br>10 11 and<br>12 I call them the championship rounds<br>the this is where your character is<br>tested and the demand kicks in and the<br>intensity heightens by this stage and<br>you all know you're feeling mentally and<br>physically fatigued but you know you got<br>to uh dig deep it's a true test of your<br>W and your<br>tana and throughout the fight every now<br>and then you know there's the old<br>knockdown the old eight or 10 count but<br>that's uh the whole test of uh your<br>character are you going to take<br>or you or you going to be counted out so<br>the only thing we do is we get back up<br>and continue it's all about your<br>Mana then we leave it to the judges or<br>the markers and then we wait we<br>painfully wait for our scores and<br>receive our<br>ours and then you come back next<br>trimester and do it all over again what<br>life so I want to acknowledge the<br>graduates of 2023 for your dedication<br>mahi and sacrifice throughout this<br>journey and wish you all the very best<br>uh for your next chapter in life so go<br>and celebrate cuz I know I will I<br>already know that I'll be wearing this<br>academic attire for probably the next<br>two months I've already booked in<br>Christmas New<br>Year um Wellington anniversary<br>2024 so I'm here to the academic just<br>Extinction want now about my experience<br>as uh in particular um being a mature<br>student uh before I embarked on this uh<br>beautiful journey I was employed by New<br>Zealand post and kiwi Bank worked for<br>them for 19 years 20 sounds better but<br>we'll stick with the<br>19 uh from November 2019 to June 2020 I<br>tried my hand at uh DIY and it's lucky<br>there were no assessments there uh<br>covid-19 arrived and then the lockdown<br>happened between March and May<br>and it was around this time I was<br>convinced to follow my heart and finally<br>pursue the dream of university studies<br>in June 2020 I made the call to the<br>amazing Jin T he was a Pacific adviser<br>at the time and told her that I was<br>really um uh ready to finally pursue<br>this uh this dream which we were very um<br>excited about and then jny connected me<br>with t as student Recruitment and there<br>we started the process which the<br>universally kindly accepted<br>me I<br>um reflect back that my first meeting<br>with um t i remember we had to go<br>wherever she asked me the question I was<br>like oh we got all your details and do<br>you have an email address and a and a<br>phone number and I said uh no I only<br>have my wife's email address and I don't<br>have a phone and she goes not on you and<br>I said no never so prior to my studies I<br>never owned a phone I was stubborn um<br>so leaving that office that day she<br>strongly advised me I think it's best<br>you get a phone so I ended up at har nor<br>and poor the day before my first<br>lecture um and the lovely retailer tried<br>to sell me a phone for like $1,000 and I<br>said what's your cheapest phone and he<br>goes want that 77 I say what that sounds<br>good the year I was born I'll take that<br>year I still remember when I attended my<br>studies um it was like a Monday July<br>13th he was counting<br>2020 and then I attended my um uh uh<br>anthropology cultural anthropology<br>lecture the next<br>um when I think about how I<br>felt heart was full and I knew it was me<br>to be in the space 20 years at the bank<br>was amazing but yeah attending<br>University was the uh long the dream for<br>me so and it was also the day uh the<br>week sorry where I uh first met my um<br>Study Buddies it was all the mature<br>students so I want to shout out to uh<br>Vicky pal uh my and Titi a thank you

all good now I<br>can a drop and all sorts of stuff like<br>that you<br>know people often ask me how I feel<br>about uh University it's always family<br>and friends right from the the first<br>week in 2020 I still bump to friends and<br>family now and they always ask and like<br>hey how's our University going and what<br>was it like same reply I love<br>it yeah full vessel all the<br>time it's funny when you write stuff<br>down on the speech and not really<br>following it and then yeah anyway that's<br>all<br>good uh but one of the highlights for me<br>was uh uh meeting people uh meeting<br>people from all different uh uh<br>backgrounds from staff to uh the<br>students um I've developed some um<br>amazing relationships and if there were<br>any words to describe my journey
