God<br>he<br>seated Mora good morning and welcome to<br>this graduation ceremony for oroi the<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government<br>and the faculty of law<br>I am Professor daan Higgins Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor M and engagement and your MC<br>for this<br>ceremony I am delighted you could join<br>us this morning to celebrate the<br>achievements of your family member<br>friend or colleague as well as being<br>proud Spectators you are also formal<br>witnesses to these official<br>proceedings a very warm welcome also to<br>Foo and Friends throughout alel and from<br>across the globe viewing these<br>proceedings via our live<br>stream I would now like to introduce to<br>you the chancellor of theing aaka<br>Victoria University of<br>Wellington this is a role that dates<br>back to the Middle Ages when the first<br>universities were established the<br>chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the university strategic<br>Direction mininger ladies and gentlemen<br>the chancellor John<br>Allen<br>in johnen to it is my<br>great pleasure as Chancellor of the<br>university to welcome you to this<br>celebration and it is a celebration<br>despite the formalities that we've just<br>been through the formalities yet to come<br>this is primarily a celebration of our<br>graduates of your work your effort your<br>challenge that you've met head on and<br>your success and we want this occasion<br>to be one that you enjoy that you<br>remember and that you feel extraordinary<br>valued and proud of uh as you move<br>forward in your life we also want to<br>welcome your Faro friends and others<br>because we know you haven't done it on<br>your own we know that you've brought all<br>kinds of people together to enable you<br>to be successful here today and so to<br>all of your supporters uh welcome and we<br>want to recognize in this celebration<br>the success and Challenge and skill of<br>the extraordinary academic community<br>that sit behind me some of them behind<br>me that's the brains Trust of the<br>university the people have actually<br>helped you with the professional staff<br>and academic staff to get where you are<br>today so remember this is a celebration<br>that means noise uh that means sort of<br>uh interpretive dance from time to time<br>although I know this is a business and<br>law and public policy group so I'm not<br>sure how we'll go on interpretive dance<br>but nonetheless uh feel relaxed feel<br>comfortable uh and feel the joy uh on<br>this occasion<br>I know many of you coming in here now<br>may have the view that you've entered<br>some sort of medieval ceremony uh all<br>the rigar the trumpets all that sort of<br>thing and that coincides with the view<br>of many in society that universities are<br>somehow out of touch we're sort of<br>oldfashioned and we're not engaged in<br>the real world and that is fundamentally<br>wrong because the magic of a university<br>is that we stand with the academic<br>community in thousands of years of<br>Knowledge from all cultures across the<br>globe all that history all that<br>understanding all that lived experience<br>in all those Brains it's really quite<br>intimidating for people like me but we<br>stand in that history but every year a<br>new generation of students arrives every<br>year young people come onto this campus<br>with their issues with their motivations<br>with the challenges that they are facing<br>in their lives and it is The Clash of<br>those two things well it's not a clash<br>but you you know what I mean the<br>intermingling of those two things that<br>creates the Alchemy the magic uh of a<br>university the spark that enables ideas<br>to be generated New Paths to be forged<br>and generates the sorts of talented<br>young people and older people and all<br>people uh that we graduate from this<br>University uh<br>today expertise is a critical feature of<br>a university and you know and I know<br>that today expertise is quick questioned<br>by many who feel that their reckons on X<br>as it now is or some other social media<br>Challen uh channel are every bit is<br>valuable as somebody who's spent 5 years<br>getting a PhD or 25 years getting a<br>professorship that's what the professors<br>tell me it takes as long as that to<br>progress through the university system<br>but nonetheless it is all it's being<br>challenged in ways that it wasn't before<br>there's also a view that experts are<br>somehow arrogant know at alls and I want<br>to say to you right now that people<br>misunderstand expertise they undervalue<br>expertise and they misund understand the<br>culture of a university because the<br>culture of the university is not built<br>on having the answers it's built on<br>asking the questions it's not built on<br>certainty it is built as one of our<br>former academic leaders Peter mon said<br>it is built on the certainty of doubt<br>the willingness to keep questioning to<br>keep changing your mind to keep<br>evaluating new evidence uh as it comes<br>to life is the PowerHouse of a<br>university and it drives the academic<br>activity uh that we see nor is an<br>academic world a calm peaceful world as<br>you are seeing sitting behind me in fact<br>there is debate there is disharmony uh<br>there is argument there is all kinds of<br>intellectual rigor that is applied to<br>the generation of the knowledge what the<br>which we are then able able to impart to<br>our students and let me say to you that<br>a time when our world our country our<br>communities are facing the challenges we<br>are facing whether they're in climate or<br>war or pandemic with their housing<br>crisis Health crisis Mental Health<br>crisis we need expertise you will not<br>solve those problems with the reckons of<br>the Twitter<br>Community you need people who have<br>thought about it wrestled with it and<br>are finding the answers to<br>it the I thought a bit of poetry now is<br>that okay I'm not sure whether poetry is<br>okay in this sort of community but I I<br>thought I'd just throw in a a bit of a<br>random poem many of you will know this<br>poem so you can probably say it with me<br>it's just the the first uh verse of the<br>wonderful poem from Yates uh which is<br>called the second coming and he said<br>this turning turning in the widening<br>guia the guia is a an old word for<br>Circle the Falcon cannot not hear the<br>falconer Things Fall Apart the center<br>cannot hold mere Anarchy is loosed upon<br>the world the blood D tide is loosed and<br>everywhere ceremonies of Innocence are<br>drowned the best lack all conviction<br>while the worst are filled with<br>passionate<br>intensity and what I want to say to you<br>is that in a in an environment that we<br>are in today with the challenges of new<br>technologies and the clashes of<br>ideologies we are facing social cohesion<br>breakdown in a way that we haven't seen<br>it before and we as a university have to<br>stand strongly in that environment and<br>assert our confidence in thinking our<br>confidence in<br>expertise our confidence in being able<br>as a university to act as a Critic and<br>conscience of society and our con and<br>our confidence that our<br>teaching is world class in both teaching<br>and research and I know I felt a slight<br>ripple from the lawyers as I said all<br>that cuz they were thinking I know<br>section 267 went you of the Education<br>and Training act uh 2020 cuz that's<br>where all of that stuff comes from and<br>when you read section 267 that's 268<br>actually when you read section 268 don't<br>leap over 267 because two any of you<br>will want to go and read it after this I<br>know don't leap over<br>267 because 267 is the secret source of<br>a university 267 is academic freedom and<br>academic freedom allows us to test<br>received wisdom it allows us to produce<br>new ideas and it allows us to express<br>opinions that are<br>controversial into our<br>community and so the university is not<br>just a thinking place it's not just a<br>place of sort of quiet meditation the<br>university is a place of action where<br>that thought is transferred into real<br>policy into real activity which promotes<br>and values and improves our<br>world and when you think about the law<br>and I think about the law often because<br>I used to be a lawyer I used to be you<br>see but it's a sort of reflective thing<br>for me but nonetheless when you think<br>about the law you think about the import<br>of the the uh rule of law and the value<br>that it brings in knowing that everyone<br>in this country is equally subject and<br>entitled to access to law that everyone<br>in this country should be able to be<br>have law applied to them equally that<br>trials are fair uh and that the law is<br>as far as possible clear and<br>intelligible now those principles are<br>taken from Tom bingham's book uh rule of<br>law as you know he was a lord Chief<br>Justice of the United Kingdom and as you<br>read them through and I said that was<br>all obvious you will all know that it's<br>not obvious at all you will all know<br>that there are parts of the community in<br>this country which do not have access to<br>law you will despite the efforts of some<br>of our academics to tweet most of it on<br>a regular basis uh you will all know uh<br>that many of our people do not feel as<br>though they understand the law or know<br>where to go to understand the law even<br>our lawyers sometimes struggle to<br>understand the law and our judges<br>struggle to understand the law so it is<br>not easy to do that you know that the<br>application of the law is sometimes seen<br>as not being equally applied to all<br>parts of our community so there is a<br>need for change there is a need for<br>Challenge and evolution in our law and<br>the secret source for law in my view and<br>this may just be a reckon so just<br>discount it if uh if you disagree with<br>it or interject but in my view the<br>secret source is the common law<br>tradition the common law tradition which<br>allows judges at a particular time<br>considering all the facts of a case to<br>be able to decide how the law should<br>apply in those circumstances it is that<br>tradition that has able enabled our<br>common law to embrace uh Mari principles<br>ja Mari uh into our law it is that<br>tradition that has enabled us to move<br>forward in technology in other areas and<br>the common law is an important<br>ingredient of enabling that social Co<br>ion now for the business community that<br>are here I think if you looked at a<br>university and asked yourselves the<br>question what is it uh You' say needing<br>more funding I I think you would look at<br>the balance sheet and you would say<br>needing more funding I think you would<br>look at the p&amp;l and say needing more<br>funding and I think you'd look at the<br>vagaries of our funding model and say<br>good grief how on Earth do people do<br>that and I want to say to you that<br>you're right uh I'm just asserting that<br>that and here but nonetheless you're<br>right uh the model needs to be fixed<br>these the this institution and others<br>like it need to be funded because<br>without that funding we cannot do the<br>research we cannot attract retain and<br>develop our staff we cannot produce the<br>quality of graduates that you are and we<br>will not be able to make the impact in<br>the world that we need to collectively<br>make so thank you business graduates for<br>that Insight on the public policy front<br>they'd be saying to us well we need to<br>think about dis advantaged communities<br>and how we might engage them we need to<br>be thinking about new knowledge and how<br>we might deliver that and we are public<br>policy people we are in fact I should in<br>the public policy context have mentioned<br>the productivity crisis because I know<br>that Professor arur Grimes is up behind<br>me uh as another crisis that we need to<br>address uh but we are addressing these<br>issues we have as a university we are<br>constantly moving forward we are<br>constantly engaging with new<br>technologies New Opportunities and new<br>issues so that's the environment that<br>you come from graduates I want to<br>congratulate you on your success in that<br>environment we expect you to act this is<br>an activist sort of University in an<br>activist sort of a town in an activist<br>sort of a country and we want you to be<br>making a contribution in the real world<br>with the skills that you have from our<br>University we're looking forward to<br>seeing your progress we're looking<br>forward to seeing the difference that<br>you can make and I'll close with a poem<br>uh it's by American par called Windle<br>Berry and it something like this I get<br>it wrong from time to time uh planting<br>trees in early spring we make a place<br>for birds to sing in times to come how<br>do you know they sing there now there is<br>no other guarantee that singing will<br>ever be and I want to say to you in that<br>spirit that the university model which<br>is the tree in that poem works it's<br>planted it's established and it works we<br>need to support it because in supporting<br>the university system you're supporting<br>the generation of graduates and<br>successive years like yourselves in<br>which we can take great pride and<br>because of whom we can look confidently<br>to the future of ala the future of the<br>world you are going to make a difference<br>that<br>like to invite you back uh to award

Matt<br>Binger<br>Booker Corbin<br>chalis<br>Jessica<br>chow mu<br>chin Maria<br>alad<br>Foster<br>Kane<br>Franken Mia<br>Freeman<br>it is now with pleasure that I invite<br>our honor doctorate Christina Engles to<br>address<br>congratulations to those who are<br>graduating today it's a wonderful<br>achievement and it must no doubt have<br>felt like a massive endurance test along<br>the way uh congratulations to to those<br>who have helped you get to where you are<br>also a massive endurance test it seems<br>like a very long time ago that the vice<br>chanc rang me his first words were I<br>think you know why I'm calling to be<br>absolutely honest I thought he must be<br>donation had the University's finances<br>sank so low I wondered that the vice<br>Chancellor was resorting to cold call<br>fundraising<br>thankfully the vice Chancellor was not<br>on a mission to extract money and the<br>telephone call turned out to be a much<br>more welcome one although an immense<br>surprise it it is a huge honor to<br>receive this doctorate from a university<br>that holds such significance for my<br>family my husband Peter and I both<br>completed our Lord Grace here our four<br>children Ben Luke mayor and Indie have<br>or a studying here our daughter-in-law<br>and son-in-law studied here and my<br>sisters and brother studied here<br>too it was here at this University that<br>my parents met somewhat<br>romantically in an undergraduate French<br>class my father became a professor of<br>law at the university and taught with<br>Lum luminaries such as Sir Kenneth Keith<br>it is at Victoria University where my<br>father gained a doctorate for his work<br>and family law and at his his doctoral<br>robes that I'm wearing for this occasion<br>along with his pom pom hat although I<br>think it's probably not called a pom pom<br>ha um found at the bottom of the<br>searching the sort of luminaries that my<br>father taught with have of course been<br>replaced with successive<br>generations of luminaries including<br>those who taught me and who have guided<br>our children through this presents me<br>with an excellent opportunity to<br>sincerely thank those staff for their<br>efforts particularly their in<br>inspirational guidance genuine interest<br>and truly compassionate pastoral care<br>that they have shown in particular to<br>our children and I really thank them for<br>that I have heard a rumor that academic<br>law staff performance is measured at<br>least in part on the number of times<br>their writings get mention in a court<br>judgment that is not of course the<br>reason why the musings of one of this<br>University's current luminaries<br>Professor Gordon Anderson are cited in<br>many of my judgments and papers although<br>I do do sincerely hope that they fed<br>into an enormous Christmas bonus for him<br>this year<br>John these sorts of academic musings are<br>of particular significance in an areas<br>such as employment law which is dynamic<br>uh tends to be buffeted by The Winds of<br>political and legislative change and<br>which revolves<br>intractably around relationships and<br>inherent imbalance of power and mutual<br>obligations rights and liabilities which<br>often sit very<br>uncomfortably together grating up<br>against one another the thinking<br>explaining why things are not as<br>straightforward as some might suggest<br>identifying the underlying principles<br>and values to illuminate the way in<br>which the law might develop going<br>forward as inv valuable not just for<br>judges like me but more generally to the<br>millions of workers and Employers in ARA<br>new Zealand who work and live under the<br>shadow of the law so thank you Professor<br>Anderson there is however one thing that<br>I am not going to thank Professor<br>Anderson for and that is setting such a<br>ridiculous exam question all those years<br>ago that he robbed me literally robbed<br>me of the stunning Mark I would have<br>class I would also uh like to thank the<br>unnamed people who supported what I<br>regard as a surprising honorary<br>doctorate I asked Gordon uh for details<br>and he was very secretive simply saying<br>in a covert sort of way that a cabal had<br>been involved I've since looked up the<br>word cabal in the dictionary to say see<br>if it might cast any light on the<br>identity mystery the definition a secret<br>faction of disident united in a<br>plot so my thanks to the<br>dissidents if I could pass on two pieces<br>of advice to those who have graduated<br>today be true to yourself don't try to<br>emulate anybody else it won't work<br>be clear about what your foundational<br>principles are there are going to be<br>many difficult hurdles along the way in<br>forks and the road returning to your<br>foundational principles at times like<br>that is the shest way to navigate the<br>inevitable challenges and the shest way<br>forms and find and then tightly hold on<br>to the selfless cheerleader in your life<br>I have been truly blessed with a husband<br>Peter and sister blinda who have<br>relentlessly carried out that role over<br>the years I have also been blessed with<br>for equally intelligent but individually<br>idiosyncratic children who not<br>frequently make my day job as a judge<br>Dole but I am grateful to my cabal of<br>dissident children for continuing to<br>stretch my mind often and<br>uncomfortable sometimes confronting ways<br>I can sincerely say that they have made<br>me a much better judge so I wish to<br>publicly thank Andy mayor Luke and<br>be finally uh I wish to acknowledge the<br>OG the original cheerleader in my life<br>my mother she was an exceptionally<br>clever woman who completed her master's<br>at Victoria University and studied at<br>the soan in Paris she like many other<br>women at that time stopped paid work<br>when she married married my father and<br>started her life of unpaid work which<br>she continued to her<br>death while my father received a<br>doctorate my mother at least to my mind<br>equally deserved one for the<br>non-judgmental thinking contribution she<br>unwavy made to the society she lived in<br>she set the bar high for those who<br>follow in her wake and so I wish to did<br>dedicate my doctorate to my late mother<br>ten thank<br>you University council member<br>payi will now
