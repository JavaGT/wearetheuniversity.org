Str buness<br>uh opportunity to speak on behalf of my<br>fellow graduates it's a real privilege<br>and honor and I'm very<br>grateful uh when I received the uh<br>invitation a month ago I felt nothing<br>but truly blessed uh to cour or on<br>behalf of our um graduates um about our<br>achievements however it was also an<br>opportunity to also Flex I mean<br>demonstrate my uh public speaking skills<br>so I to those who nominated me uh it<br>lot congratulations to everyone of our<br>fellow graduates who are here today<br>Embrace this day which I know we will<br>always remember is a significant<br>Milestone and I know will be entrenched<br>in our memories and those of our<br>supporters today is also a day where we<br>get to reflect on our journey<br>J the pursuit of knowledge in our chosen<br>disciplines or I like to say passion the<br>reason why we all sitting here today<br>it's because we've done everything<br>possible to get here through our<br>dedication Mahi and sacrifice we have<br>confronted the challenge and we have won<br>the fight whether it took three four 12<br>years we've gone all the way so be proud<br>party<br>looking back at uh the structure of the<br>tri I always thought was interesting<br>from my first day and I'm sure a lot of<br>you will agree looking at um the way the<br>trimester is made up it's 12<br>weeks um imp pugilistic terms is 12<br>rounds 12 rounds of fight challenge and<br>all the hard stuff but all I know is<br>that we've all been committed that's the<br>reason why we're here for example<br>you got to start off with the<br>ding-ding you have weeks 1 to four which<br>are the kind of like the feel out rounds<br>and you know the opening rounds it's all<br>about the introductions the course<br>information the who's who and how to<br>navigate around<br>campus then we move on to weeks 5 to9<br>which are pretty much the middle rounds<br>the intensity sets in you sest essays<br>are written and you work on the body um<br>and when I say body I mean body<br>paragraphs I definitely don't miss those<br>a good boxing coach would always<br>instruct it's time to work work their<br>body and everything will fall into place<br>such as the introduction and conclusions<br>I won't miss that<br>either then finally we move on to weeks<br>10 11 and<br>12 I call them the championship rounds<br>this is where your characters tested and<br>the demand kicks in and the intensely<br>heightens by the stage and you all know<br>you're feeling mentally and physically<br>fatigued but you know you got to uh dig<br>deep it's a true test of your W and your<br>T and throughout the fight every now and<br>then you know there's the old knockdown<br>the old eight or 10 count but that's uh<br>the whole test of uh your<br>character are you going to take it or<br>you or you going to be counted out so<br>the only thing we do is we get back up<br>and continue it's all about your<br>Mana then we leave it to the judges or<br>the markers and then we wait we<br>painfully wait for our scores and<br>receive<br>ourselves and then you come back next<br>trimester and do all over again what a<br>life so I want to acknowledge the<br>graduates of 2023 for your dedication<br>Mahi and sacrifice throughout this<br>journey and wish you all the very best<br>uh for your next chapter in life so go<br>and celebrate cuz I know I will I<br>already know that I'll be wearing this<br>academic attire for probably the next 2<br>months I've already booked in Christmas<br>New<br>Year's um wington anniversary<br>2024 so I'm to the academic Dr hire for<br>extension want to quote it on now about<br>my experiences uh in particular um being<br>a mature student uh before I embarked on<br>this uh beautiful journey I was employed<br>by New Zealand post and kiwi Bank worked<br>for them for 19 years 20 sounds better<br>but we'll stick with the<br>19 uh from November 2019 to June 2020 I<br>tried my hand at uh DIY and it's lucky<br>there were no assessments there uh<br>covid-19 arrived and then the lockdown<br>happened between March and<br>May and it was around this time I was<br>convinced to follow my heart and finally<br>pursue the dream of university studies<br>in June 2020 I made the call to the<br>amazing Gena who was a Pacific adviser<br>at the time and told her that I was<br>really um uh ready to finally pursue<br>this uh this dream which we were very um<br>excited about and then Jenny connected<br>me with t as student Recruitment and<br>there we started the process which the<br>universally kindly accepted<br>me I<br>um reflect back that my first meeting<br>with um t i remember we had to go over<br>she asked me the question I was like oh<br>we got all your details and do you have<br>an email address and and a phone number<br>and I said uh no I only have my wife's<br>email address and I don't have a phone<br>and she goes not on you and I said no<br>never so prior to my studies I never<br>owned a phone I was stubborn um<br>so leaving that office that day she<br>strongly advised me I think it's best<br>you get a phone so I ended up having nor<br>and poor the day before my first<br>lecture um and the lovely retailer tried<br>to sell me a phone for like $1,000 and I<br>said what's your cheapest phone and he<br>goes I want that 77 I say w that sounds<br>good the year I
