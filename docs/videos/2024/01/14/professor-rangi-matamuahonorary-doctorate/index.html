it's about<br>particularly you graduates from this<br>year and I want to celebrate<br>all uh Chancellor when you said uh you<br>might be from the uh Dark Age<br>this morning I woke up feeling like I<br>was from the Jurassic<br>period and have to take my gal<br>things well no<br>um I just really have one message I<br>don't want to be standing up here um<br>really uh speaking at your graduates uh<br>this is your day but if there's one<br>little thing I want to leave with you<br>today is the fact that do not<br>estimate what you have done or the<br>influence that you will go on and have<br>in our society in our communities for<br>your people for our people I think back<br>to when I was here and I was just<br>catching up with one of my friends and<br>it seems like yesterday that we<br>graduated here it was actually 30 years<br>ago yeah there wasn't even a roof in<br>this building at that<br>time perhaps was the Dark Ages there<br>were no cell phones and no laptops and<br>no cars no though there were<br>cars but these people that we used to<br>hang out across the road with have gone<br>on to have a massive influence on our<br>society and I just want to mention a<br>couple of the people that we used to<br>hang out with across the road at the m<br>and particularly in the dining<br>room the likes of uh judge uh<br>kah uh judge Ian<br>Stone um broadcaster extraordinaire<br>Julian<br>wox Uh current uh ministers T<br>Paka as well as green mp uh huhana<br>Lindon uh we had<br>tati uh we had uh people like Chay<br>Wilson I'm putting his name in because<br>his sister's here and um she will say<br>something I don't mention him<br>these people have gone on to have a<br>massive and will continue to do so have<br>an important role to play that's because<br>this<br>institution built a foundation<br>underneath those people an academic<br>Foundation upon which they were able to<br>go out into the World and Achieve some<br>incredible things that same Foundation<br>is what you stand upon today when you<br>receive your<br>degree and you will go and have that<br>fact you will fail the legacy of those<br>who have come before you if you don't go<br>out and seek to achieve at the highest<br>levels there is a<br>saying the student who remains the<br>student ultimately fails the<br>teacher and if you reach this point in<br>your lives and in your career and this<br>is your ceiling then you ultimately fail<br>the institution upon what you stand<br>today and so I encourage you to not<br>underestimate the power that lies within<br>your hands and the influence that you<br>will<br>saying if you drink from the pool from<br>the river never ever forget the source<br>never forget the source upon which you<br>were built and I look behind you and<br>there are your family and friends and in<br>front of you there are the people that<br>have spent the past few years being the<br>pull from what you've drawn your<br>sustenance in terms of your knowledge<br>and I want to Mii to all of you the<br>teachers and I also want to take this<br>opportunity to Mii to a couple of people<br>that I usually wouldn't Mii to or say<br>something about in a public setting but<br>because I'm back at the place from which<br>I came from in terms of my academic<br>career I look around here hooking<br>mahara there are two people that I want<br>to really acknowledge<br>um first firstly I want to uh say a a<br>something about um my auntie who was my<br>first teacher when I came here T Higgins<br>uh who has been<br>uh a real pillar of this institution for<br>uh I also want to mention uh my uncle<br>sir Professor po who has been a guiding<br>hand in my entire career and uh if I've<br>done anything in my career much of it<br>has to do with his influence and input I<br>also want to mention another graduate<br>from this<br>institution uh Professor arnia<br>Higgins uh someone who was just doing<br>extraordinary things particularly across<br>the road in in 12 months time hopefully<br>we'll have a graduation in the new par<br>that's being established at the moment<br>and that will be another another<br>institution Kahu said um some<br>words um today during his fake a uh Kura<br>Kura sorry Kura sorry Kura I'm looking<br>at my son kah over there because this<br>message is for him could have said uh<br>fire I translate that in two ways<br>firstly um you know go beyond what is<br>done you are a critical thinker you have<br>been taught to go beyond and push the<br>boundaries in everything that you do<br>that's number one number two fire mean<br>support the<br>blues particularly in New South Wales<br>and um son you and your uncle Leon Blake<br>could really heed that<br>advice finally uh Vice Chancellor I just<br>want to finish um by saying I started<br>here in<br>1992 and I at that stage was an awe of a<br>a very<br>um very<br>handsome uh capable academic who was the<br>first person I had class with and that<br>was Peter ads now Peter ads was already<br>an institution in<br>1992 uh Vice Chancellor he's been here<br>so long I think it's not only when we<br>open the PA we should probably think<br>about naming another building after<br>Peter ads and I'm thinking probably a<br>cafe where they serve coffee and pies in<br>the morning and a wide selection of<br>evenings</p></main><footer
