endurance test along<br>the way uh congratulations to to those<br>who have helped you get to where you are<br>all also a massive endurance test it<br>seems like a very long time ago that the<br>vice Chancellor rang me his first words<br>were I think you know why I'm calling to<br>be absolutely honest I thought he must<br>donation had the University's finances<br>sankk so low I wondered that the vice<br>Chancellor was resorting to cold call<br>fundraising thankfully the vice<br>Chancellor was not on a mission to<br>extract money and the telephone call<br>turned out to be a much more welcome one<br>although an immense<br>surprise it it is a huge honor to<br>receive this doctorate from a university<br>that holds such significance for my<br>family my husband Peter and I both<br>completed our Lord grece here here our<br>four children Ben Luke mayor and indy<br>have or a studying here our<br>daughter-in-law and son-in-law studied<br>here and my sisters and brother studied<br>here<br>too it was here at this University that<br>my parents met somewhat<br>romantically in an undergraduate French<br>class my father became a professor of<br>law at the University and taught with<br>Lum luminaries such as Sir Kenneth Keith<br>it is at Victoria University where my<br>father gained a doctorate for his work<br>and family law and it his his doctoral<br>robes that I'm wearing for this occasion<br>along with his pom pom head although I<br>think it's probably not called a pom pom<br>head as um found at the bottom of the<br>dress scene up box after a lot of<br>frenetic<br>chain the sort of luminaries that my<br>father Tau with have of course been<br>replaced with successive<br>generations of luminaries including<br>those who taught me and who have guided<br>our children through this presents me<br>with an excellent opportunity to<br>sincerely thank those staff for their<br>efforts particularly their inspirational<br>guidance<br>genuine interest and truly compassionate<br>pastoral care that they have shown in<br>particular to our children and I really<br>thank them for<br>that I have heard a rumor that academic<br>law staff performance has measured at<br>least in part on the number of times<br>their RS get mention in a court<br>judgment that is not of course the<br>reason<br>why the musings of one of this<br>University's current luminaries<br>Professor Gordon Anderson are cited in<br>many of my judgments and papers although<br>I do do sincerely hope that they fed<br>into an enormous Christmas bonus for him<br>John these sorts of academic musings are<br>of particular sign significance and an<br>areas such as employment law which is<br>dynamic uh tends to be buffeted by The<br>Winds of political and legislative<br>change and which revolves<br>intractably around relationships an<br>inherent imbalance of power and mutual<br>obligations rights and liabilities which<br>often sit very<br>uncomfortably together grating up<br>against one another the thinking<br>explaining why things are not as<br>straightforward as some might suggest<br>identifying the underlying principles<br>and values to illuminate the way in<br>which the law might develop going<br>forward as invaluable not just for<br>judges like me but more generally to the<br>millions of workers and Employers in ARA<br>New Zealand who were and live under the<br>shadow of the law so thank you Professor<br>Anderson there is however one thing that<br>I am not going to thank Professor<br>Anderson for and that is setting such a<br>ridiculous exam question all those years<br>ago that he robbed me literally robbed<br>me of the stunning Mark I would have<br>received for his employment law<br>class<br>I would also uh like to thank the<br>unnamed people who supported what I<br>regard as a surprising honorary<br>doctorate I asked Gordon uh for details<br>and he was very secretive simply saying<br>in a covert sort of way that a cabal had<br>been involved I've since looked up the<br>word cabal in the dictionary to see if<br>it might cast any light on the identity<br>mystery the definition a secret faction<br>of dissidents united in app<br>PL so my thanks to the<br>dissidents if I could pass on two pieces<br>of advice to those who have graduated<br>today be true to yourself don't try to<br>emulate anybody else it won't work be<br>clear about what your foundational<br>principles are there are going to be<br>many difficult hurdles along way and<br>forks in the road returning to your<br>foundational principles at times like<br>that is the shest way to navigate the<br>inevitable challenges and the shest way<br>forms and find and then tightly hold on<br>to the selfless cheerleader in your life<br>I have been truly blessed with a husband<br>Peter and sister blinda who have<br>relentlessly carried out that role over<br>the years I have also been blessed with<br>four equally intelligent but<br>individually<br>idiosyncratic children who not<br>infrequently make my day job as a judge<br>Dole but I am grateful to my cabal of<br>dissident children for continuing to<br>stretch my mind often and<br>uncomfortable sometimes confronting ways<br>I can sincerely say that they have made<br>me a much better judge so I wish to<br>publicly thank Andy mayor Luke<br>andb finally uh I wish to acknowledge<br>the OG the original cheerleader in my<br>life my mother she was an exceptionally<br>clever woman who completed her master's<br>at Victoria University and studied at<br>the soan in Paris she like many other<br>woman at that time stopped paid work<br>when she married my father and started<br>her life of unpaid work which she<br>continued to her<br>death while my father received a<br>doctorate my mother at least to my mind<br>equally deserved one for the<br>non-judgmental thinking contribution she<br>unwavy made to the society she loved in<br>she set the bar high for those who<br>follow in her wake and so I wish to<br>dedicate my doctorate to my late mother<br>ten</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
