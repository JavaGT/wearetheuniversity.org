people still want to do the whole<br>bracket<br>so graduates when your name is called<br>please make your way directly to the<br>chancellor for a photo you will then<br>and I would now I'd like to introduce to<br>you the chancellor of tah aaka victoriia<br>University of Wellington this is a role<br>that dates back to the Middle Ages when<br>the first universities were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>Direction ladies and gentlemen the<br>Ellen<br>in<br>manao Teno<br>Teno T coj Allen tooa and it's my great<br>pleasure as Chancellor of taring aaka to<br>welcome you all to this celebration it<br>is primarily a celebration of our<br>graduates a recognition of your success<br>a recognition of your work our pride in<br>your achievement and that is why we have<br>the singing the dancing the movement the<br>energy uh from Faro and friends it's a<br>recognition of your family and Foo and<br>all the support that they have provided<br>provided to you because we know as you<br>know that you haven't done this on your<br>own it takes a community a village a<br>whole whole nation uh to raise the<br>community of Scholars that are<br>represented to us uh in our graduates<br>today across all the disciplines of the<br>university and it's a wonderful<br>opportunity for us to celebrate you and<br>Foo it's all also a statement about<br>universities it's a public statement<br>about our place in this Society in the<br>21st century a public statement about<br>our willingness to engage and celebrate<br>mom T Mari and the practice Tanga and<br>laws and learnings of Mari and that is<br>what we are doing in this ceremony today<br>now I know that many people and in fact<br>uh rnia just said it think that we dress<br>up like this and we're in funny hats uh<br>that we are from the Middle Ages fact<br>she said I was from the Middle Ages<br>which probably most of you recognized as<br>I came up up uh but nonetheless the<br>truth is this that what we are is a<br>university that stands in thousands of<br>years of lived experience and knowledge<br>from all kinds of communities across the<br>globe in time including matonga Mai so<br>we have that in the heads of all of the<br>academics up here the brains Trust of<br>the university and the wonderful thing<br>about a university is all that<br>experience every year engages with a new<br>generation of students students who are<br>active and interested in the particular<br>challenges of contemporary society and<br>it is in the melding of those two the<br>experience and the knowledge of all of<br>our academics uh and the excitement and<br>advocacy and energy of all of our<br>students that the magic of a university<br>occurs that's where the new thinking<br>comes and that's where the energy comes<br>from that's where the activism comes<br>from the teriz people in a university<br>and particularly people at taring aaka I<br>know that are people who say that<br>expertise is no longer valuable uh<br>because you can get it on YouTube or you<br>can get it through Google but let me<br>tell you that you can't Google solve the<br>problems that are confronting our<br>country and our world today you can't<br>use Twitter reckons to deal with war you<br>can't use Twitter reckons to engage with<br>tiriti you can't use tw Twitter reckons<br>to get through issues like climate<br>change or the very ious crises that are<br>currently confronting us that needs real<br>knowledge that needs real study and I<br>want to recognize our P PhD graduate<br>particularly for the years of study that<br>you have put in to learning<br>understanding CFT and that sets us up as<br>a society to be able to engage with the<br>issues that confront us now I know and<br>you know that one of the major issues<br>that confront us at the moment uh is the<br>relations between Mar and P<br>we know that those are issues that are<br>being talked about and we heard them in<br>the speech from the throne in Parliament<br>uh the other day so I think it is<br>important that we take this opportunity<br>to talk to you not about the history<br>because there are people like Peter EDS<br>up here who know far more about the<br>history than I do not about the<br>complicated elements of the treaty and<br>its birth and the way in which it has<br>been apply but I what I want to talk to<br>you about is the University's position<br>and role both in addressing the<br>challenges that are confronting Us in<br>this particular time in this particular<br>debate and how we are looking to the<br>Future and so the first thing that I<br>want to say to you about that is that<br>the university respects honors values<br>and wants to see implemented T Tre and<br>here<br>what we mean by that is that we want<br>Mari to be able to celebrate and live as<br>Mari we want Mari to be able to engage<br>in community as Mari we want Mari<br>knowledge to be able to inform our<br>thinking and our learning and our wisdom<br>and we want<br>tinang because we know that without<br>tinang Tanga we are never going to<br>develop the potential of our society and<br>so it is time ladies and G gentlemen for<br>us to say publicly as a university that<br>we are a university that is committed to<br>been we have been for many years at the<br>Forefront of activism around Tero uh you<br>know that and I know that and Rob Wier<br>of course continues that battle today<br>and we need to make make sure that that<br>momentum continues and we will put our<br>shoulders to that wheel because without<br>the language without the language the<br>culture cannot flourish and with the<br>language we are unstoppable together and<br>so I want to say to you that we are<br>committed to the<br>language we recognize maneno and that's<br>already been recognized by many speakers<br>but I want to particularly recognize uh<br>the uh tiawa<br>uh tarako representative Kur it was<br>particularly kind of you to come and<br>speak for us uh today we recognize TI we<br>recognize natia ranga we recognize rwa<br>uh and other ewi that are important in<br>this region uh and are contributing to<br>this region you know there's a very<br>famous poem well it's not that famous<br>actually but I'm about to make it famous<br>uh it's a it's an old poem that's by a<br>chck called Charles Brash who was a<br>lived he was an academic he was an<br>artist he was a poet uh and he wrote a<br>poem when Robin Hyde who was an author a<br>well-known kiwi author uh died at a very<br>early age and he said of Robin<br>Hyde it by choice you lived always on<br>disputed ground you lived always on<br>disputed ground and I want to say to you<br>that the place of a university is to<br>stand on disputed ground the place of a<br>university is to engage with the big<br>issues the big disputes of the time and<br>that is what we will do that is what we<br>will continue to do and the reason that<br>we do that or the way that we do that is<br>that we do that by engaging successive<br>generations of students and enabling<br>them to think for<br>themselves we do it through world class<br>teaching and learning and I just want to<br>recognize the professional staff the<br>academic staff the incredible people of<br>this place the incredible knowledge they<br>have and their generosity in sharing<br>that knowledge uh with our students and<br>we ask challenged as well to act as a<br>Critic and conscience of society and to<br>do all of this the university has a I<br>don't know mag Source I suppose they'<br>say it's in the statutes and it's called<br>academic freedom academic freedom and<br>that what that means is academics and<br>students have the privilege of<br>questioning receive wisdom have the<br>privilege of thinking up and presenting<br>new ideas and have the privilege of<br>saying things that are controversial or<br>might be OB objected to now I recognize<br>that in some small corners of our<br>country some of the things I've said<br>today might be controversial and<br>objected to and I'm no academic so I<br>don't have the privilege of academic<br>freedom but I am a citizen of this this<br>country I have lived in this country all<br>my life and what I say is what I believe<br>and I believe that unless we as a<br>university and a community embrace our<br>Mari embrace our history read it<br>understand it think it live it and then<br>look to our future we are not going to<br>achieve the potential that we need now<br>the reason all of that is important is<br>not because I think it but because I<br>Look to this generation of graduates to<br>advance it no pressure you're going to<br>be in every part of our society you're<br>going to be lawyers you're going to be<br>doctors probably not doctors today but<br>nonetheless or do we do have a doctor<br>today that's good um you're going to be<br>thinkers you're going to be policy<br>makers you're going to be educ Educators<br>all of the strands of our society and to<br>that you're going to take tari you're<br>going to take your culture don't leave<br>it at the door take it with you if<br>you've learned one thing at teing a<br>walker is to value your culture to C<br>celebrate your culture and to stand firm<br>in your culture uh as you move forward<br>uh we're sufficiently committed to this<br>that we're building a new path uh as you<br>know a living part just across the road<br>you can go and see it it's a magnificent<br>thing it's a Sustainable Building it's a<br>living building uh which is an<br>incredible thing which will be managing<br>all its own water doing you know it's<br>just incredible from a sort of<br>sustainability uh point of view that<br>building and Toho actually have do too<br>have one of those already yeah they do<br>we're following Toho uh as you imagine<br>we're a bit behind Toho that's not<br>uncommon I<br>suspect Tang treaty have always been<br>behind Tang fena um you it takes us a<br>many many generations to get up to speed<br>but we we're slowly edging there<br>although people still write these Dam<br>big books about the T treaty you will<br>have seen and nid Fletcher wrote a book<br>about 5,000 pages long they're great<br>books to read but the truth is pretty<br>simple and I hope I've play I've stated<br>it simply just honor it and we can move<br>on um the point about the power is that<br>it is a statement about this<br>University's commitment uh we don't just<br>talk about this stuff we don't just<br>teach the stuff we don't just celebrate<br>the stuff we actually believe the stuff<br>uh and we are confident that this<br>University and our students are going to<br>be able to stand in 21st century Al<br>contribute to the future of our country<br>uh and make a real difference in<br>advancing CH Mari uh at this time and in<br>this place that Spirit can I<br>congratulate all of our graduates on<br>your achievements today I'm looking<br>forward to seeing you come across the<br>stage uh can I just say to all of the<br>family that are here IO that are here<br>it's really fabulous

Allen<br>Chancellor now confer on ranu Leslie Mar<br>the degree of doctor of literature<br>anoris<br>cza<br>for<br>fora it is now my pleasure that I invite<br>our honor doctor Rua to give today's<br>graduation<br>address<br>Chancellor Vice Chancellor uh to my<br>esteemed uh friends and uh fellow<br>institution I won't be long this day is<br>not about uh really about me it's about<br>particularly you graduates from this<br>year and I want to celebrate you all uh<br>Chancellor when you said uh you might be<br>from the uh Dark Ages this morning I<br>woke up feeling like I was from the<br>Jurassic period uh and have to take my<br>gout medication to ensure I stay on top<br>of<br>things well no<br>um I just really have one message I<br>don't want to be standing up here um<br>really uh speaking at your graduates uh<br>this is your day but if there's one<br>little thing I want to leave with you<br>today is the fact that do not<br>underestimate what you have done or the<br>influence that you will go on and have<br>in our society and our communities for<br>your people for our people I think back<br>to when I was here and I was just<br>catching up with one of my friends and<br>it seems like yesterday that we<br>graduated here it was actually 30 years<br>ago yeah there wasn't even a roof in<br>this building at that<br>time perhaps was the Dark Ages there<br>were no cell phones and no laptops and<br>no cars no though there were cars<br>but these people that we used to hang<br>out across the road with have gone on to<br>have a massive influence on our society<br>and I just want to mention a couple of<br>the people that we used to hang out with<br>across the road at the m and<br>particularly in the dining<br>room the likes of uh judge uh K<br>tahana uh judge Damien<br>Stone um broadcaster extraordinaire<br>Julian wox<br>Uh current uh ministers<br>tamaka as well as greens mp uh huhana<br>Lindon uh we had<br>taoti uh we had uh people like Chay<br>Wilson I'm putting his name in because<br>his sister's here and um she will say<br>something if I don't mention<br>him these people have gone on to have a<br>massive and will continue to do so have<br>an important role to play that's because<br>this<br>institution built a foundation<br>underneath those people an academic<br>Foundation upon which they were able to<br>go out into the World and Achieve some<br>incredible things that same Foundation<br>is what you stand upon today when you<br>receive your<br>degree and you will go and have that in<br>fact you will fail the legacy of those<br>who have come before you if if you don't<br>go<br>out and seek to achieve at the highest<br>levels there is a<br>saying the student who remains the<br>student ultimately fails the<br>teacher and if you reach this point in<br>your lives and in your career and this<br>is your ceiling then you ultimately fail<br>the institution upon what you stand<br>today and so I encourage you to not<br>underestimate the power that lies within<br>your hands and the influence that you<br>will<br>saying if you drink from the pool from<br>the river never ever forget the source<br>never forget the source upon which you<br>were built and I look behind you and<br>there are your family and friends and in<br>front of you there are the people that<br>have spent the past few years being the<br>pool from which you've drawn your<br>sustenance in terms of your knowledge<br>and I want to Mii to all of you the<br>teachers and I also want to take this<br>opportunity to Mi to a couple of people<br>that I usually wouldn't Mii to or say<br>something about in a public setting but<br>because I'm back at the place from which<br>I came from in terms of my academic<br>career I look around here hooking<br>aara there are two people that I want to<br>really acknowledge<br>um firstly I want to uh say a a<br>something about uh<br>my auntie who was my first teacher when<br>I came here TI bu<br>Higgins who has been<br>uh a real pillar of this institution for<br>uh I also want to mention um my uncle uh<br>sir Professor<br>po who has been a guiding hand in my<br>entire career and uh if I've done<br>anything in my career much of it has to<br>do with his influence and input I also<br>want to mention another graduate from<br>this<br>institution uh Professor arnia<br>Higgins uh someone who is just doing<br>extraordinary things particularly across<br>the road and in 12 months time hopefully<br>we'll have a graduation in the new par<br>that's being established at the moment<br>and that will be another foundational<br>step in this<br>institution Kaho said um some<br>words um today during his fake<br>a Kura Kura sorry Kura sorry Kura I'm<br>looking at my son Kahu over there<br>because this message is for him CA said<br>uh<br>fire I translate that in two ways<br>firstly um you know go beyond what is<br>done you are a critical thinker you have<br>been taught to go beyond and push the<br>boundaries in everything that at you do<br>that's number one number two fahur means<br>support the<br>blues particularly in New South Wales<br>and um son you and your uncle Leon Blake<br>could really heed that<br>advice finally uh Vice Chancellor I just<br>want to finish um by saying I started<br>here in<br>1992 and I at that stage was an a of a<br>very<br>um very handsome uh capable academic who<br>was the first person I had class with<br>and that was Peter ads now Peter ads was<br>already an institution in<br>1992 uh Vice Chancellor he's been here<br>so long I think it's not only when we<br>open the par we should probably think<br>about naming another building after<br>Peter ads and I'm thinking probably a<br>cafe where they serve coffee and pies in<br>the morning and a wide selection of<br>the chancellor will now recognize the<br>graduates as listed in the graduation<br>program will all degrees diplomas and<br>you<br>Chancellor<br>this is an important piece because it's<br>the part we really get to graduate so<br>here we go I John Allen Chancellor of<br>taring aaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington would like to formally<br>recognize the persons whose names are<br>entered in the presentation of graduates<br>the degrees diplomas and certificates<br>they appearing and confirm that they<br>have been admitted to these degrees<br>diplomas and

we've just heard from the chancellor<br>universities have a fundamental role in<br>enriching knowledge creativity and<br>diverse ways of understanding the world<br>this University is no exception and<br>research is one of the key cont<br>contributions that we make in that<br>domain our doctoral graduates achieve<br>academically at the very highest level<br>and their research has provided insights<br>into some of the major questions Society<br>faces it's difficult in a contemporary<br>World often to separate expertise and<br>opinion yet these graduates have spent<br>several years doing exactly that they<br>help us understand the past the present<br>and many many possible Futures they're<br>independent thinkers and makers who are<br>active and engaged Global Citizens and<br>we're very proud of what they've<br>achieved and we're very proud to know<br>them now the short citation that I will<br>share now gives only a glimpse of the<br>impact and innovation of this work<br>however

continue<br>and contribute to the life of t aaka as<br>part of their academic Journey this year<br>I am pleased to award this Tonga to<br>con<br>am<br>it is a tradition at this University<br>that the last of the for speeches is<br>IU the The Address given on behalf of<br>all graduates is delivered by a student<br>who has stood out in their time at to<br>heading aaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington by exemplifying the qualities<br>we seek to instill in our graduates<br>Mitchell<br>during her time here Kelly has been caki<br>of naoa an elected student<br>representative on the<br>faculty on the and an elect I got I got<br>discombobulated by<br>the okay Kelly has been COI OFA an<br>elected student representative on the<br>University Council and an assistant<br>lecturer at the faculty of law Kelly has<br>graduated today with a conjoint Bachelor<br>of Arts and Bachelor of<br>laws<br>k<br>for<br>John<br>Smith<br>it is my great honor to speak today on<br>graduating I started as a student here<br>in 2018 and today I'm graduating with a<br>bachelor of laws and a Bachelor of Arts<br>double majoring in M and M<br>studies<br>K I'm also beginning a masters of law<br>here at tedding aaka and I'm an<br>assistant lecturer of law at the faculty<br>of law down at pip campus so even though<br>I'm graduating today I will be back here<br>on Monday for work and I will be<br>studying here for a little while<br>longer uh to know what you are getting<br>into with this cordor and because I'm<br>now in the habit of giving learning<br>objectives uh I want to give you a heads<br>up that this cordor is just a big series<br>of M to all the wonderful people here so<br>be ready for lots of<br>gushing I arrived at Ted aaka like many<br>toy Mai with less than ideal connection<br>to my fak papa to marai<br>toi this weak connection had been<br>bugging me during my later years of high<br>school and in 2017 I received some<br>advice from a senior member of our M<br>hockey<br>team and she told me that the best step<br>for reconciling thatu was to learn ti so<br>I came here to do that I tacked lore on<br>the side because I was big into some<br>political movements and still am that<br>utilize legal expertise and because I'd<br>watched my mom who's here today study to<br>become a lawyer and then work as one and<br>she made it look like a piece of cake uh<br>which I should have known was a mirage<br>in fact to be completely honest I was<br>overconfident in every respect regarding<br>how easy it would be to learn all that I<br>wanted to learn here and nothing more so<br>than the challenge it would be to learn<br>too all secondary too Learners will know<br>this but you never really learn to as a<br>language the lessons are not limited to<br>the language to the grammar the syntax<br>the Koo but extend to all matters of Tia<br>history faka Papa and even dress code to<br>learn the language you must adopt it<br>into your life you must reconnect proper<br>find Kuro move in circles with other<br>speakers which if youd rather be a<br>hermit like me is more challenging than<br>reading any<br>textbook um and naturally that this<br>means that there is no harder job than<br>teaching AO ouro lecturers at teda Waka<br>do not limit our learnings to just the<br>language but instruct on these Tik<br>history fak<br>papaa they act as quasi therapists for<br>the occasional student<br>Chase up essays from other students at<br>land occupations support student run<br>Copa and are forced into the public eye<br>as champions of the language a position<br>which attracts a lot of public scrutiny<br>our MTI studies lecturers and my m<br>lecturers at the law school fill similar<br>support roles for students and advocacy<br>positions within the<br>university um and within the wider<br>Community their individual and<br>Collective resilience is<br>unmatched uh therefore on behalf of the<br>TOA graduating today I want to give the<br>first acknowledgement to those lecturers<br>tutors and kahi and if I may be selfish<br>uh Matthews who's graduating today as<br>well but who was my M studies tutor in<br>first year uh Mike Ross Vinnie olon<br>reader Kelly Peter EDS Carwin Jones Luke<br>Stevens um although the last six years<br>have been spent in lectures and<br>tutorials with those wonderful teachers<br>getting these degrees it would be<br>incorrect to say that the learning has<br>been done exclusively in those spaces at<br>least and perhaps especially for thari<br>the learning comes from being alongside<br>each other the best thing to have<br>happened to me at University was<br>becoming involved in M student cohorts<br>through the M Students Association and<br>the M Students<br>Association from indepth warer on TI<br>compliant constitutional change to<br>having tiny tomana quite literally grab<br>my arms to teach me how to move po<br>correctly we support each other in all<br>matter of ways to become the<br>best I like to think that I gave back in<br>my own way always being on hand for an<br>essay proof read and definitely not<br>giving generous discounts to Dollar Red<br>Bull vodkas at the bar that I worked at<br>on the weekends to all my to Mar<br>Pals kutu so and maldi not only draw<br>learnings from each other but also<br>inspiration as maldi students we embark<br>on diverse academic Journeys each with<br>unique aspirations and dreams however<br>amidst the diversity there is a Common<br>Thread that weaves us together the<br>unwavering dedication to honored suuna<br>who have paved the way for us and<br>continue paying in that way for the Tupa<br>who will come after us our Tupa walked<br>Paths of<br>resilience uh wisdom and sacrifice and<br>in every wer exam late night study<br>session and perhaps even the Thursday<br>trip to the resident karaoke competition<br>we carry their aspirations and successes<br>on our shoulders we are not simply TOA<br>we are torchbearers of a proud<br>POA therefore the success that you see<br>today is not the student cohorts alone<br>it belongs to the collective to the Faro<br>who have supported us and who come here<br>today to<br>celebrate these students reference you<br>all constantly they talk about what<br>they've learned from you their desires<br>to succeed for you how proud they are to<br>cohort as we Revel in our achievements<br>today let us not confine our thoughts to<br>our<br>immediate but extend our gaze to our<br>indigenous Faro around the world<br>I wanted to draw particular attention to<br>ouro in Palestine who like us have<br>similar aspirations to honor their<br>Papa but whose dreams have been marred<br>or otherwise destroyed by the realities<br>of<br>invasion the pursuit of Education the<br>desire to honor tuna and the yearning to<br>create a better future for Al tamariki<br>are Universal sentiments particularly<br>amongst indigenous communities however<br>for many of our communities these dreams<br>are stifled by circumstances beyond<br>their control our heart Hearts A for<br>Alano in Palestine and for our<br>indigenous communities globally who face<br>unimaginable<br>challenges today we stand here with the<br>privilege of education and the<br>opportunity it brings and with this<br>privilege become comes a responsibility<br>a responsibility to uplift and support<br>those who share our Ambitions but who<br>are denied the access we often take for<br>granted in the face of adversity it is<br>our duty to become a Beacon of Hope as<br>we celebrate our success today let us<br>not forget those who denied the same<br>opportunities I implore each graduate to<br>consider the ways that we might be able<br>to contribute to the empowerment of our<br>Global indigenous Faro with this new<br>government it is even more imperative<br>for us to stand strong in our indigen<br>and and affirm our rights and the rights<br>OFA and the rights<br>ofi<br>met<br>I hope that you all have kadoo chest<br>today in response to this amazing<br>achievement I will always be in LLY in<br>awe and proud of TOA Mari if you'll<br>allow me to be cringe um the belief that<br>I have in TOA Mari is the reason that I<br>stood<br>alongside and the reason that I'm<br>sticking around to work here at<br>the um I hope that I want to see more<br>toari pursue these degrees and Achieve<br>them and I hope that one day when your<br>tamariki attend University you'll be<br>able to send them my way so that I can<br>support them their success just as you<br>have supported mine and each other's to<br>be selfish for the final time I want to<br>acknowledge three graduates today who<br>have been great friends and supporters<br>herea<br>fore<br>magic magic people to me your magic<br>people<br>to<br>up because your magic your magic people<br>people head up high<br>your proud to<br>be proud<br>to<br>tqu<br>Kelly that Bata sums up really what this<br>is all about be proud to be Mai uh<br>recognize n and to Mai uh in our<br>University and the opportunity that they<br>represent for our future and can I just<br>say that the good news in Kelly's uh<br>message uh was that she's here she's<br>staying here so if you doubt doubted<br>that the University was going to make<br>progress in the mission that I talked<br>about at the beginning you can have no<br>doubts now because we've got Kelly<br>firing us up from the uh from the inside<br>uh Kelly won't let us take a step<br>backwards she'll constantly P us forward<br>and I know that's a fact because she's<br>been on Council for the last few years<br>and has been a magnificent contributor<br>uh to the direction and drive of Mali<br>within this University so it's going to<br>continue we're going to get better we're<br>going to get the<br>the the Maria the better is is the<br>phrase that I what is it it's the more<br>the Maria I get it I get it muddled up<br>the more the Mario is

great University with<br>more than a 100 Years of scholarship uh<br>throughout your future career career of<br>further study I'm sure you'll meet many<br>others who will tell you proudly that<br>they have studied here we look forward<br>to staying in touch with you and hearing<br>Kor<br>Smith<br>for it's my honor this morning or this<br>afternoon now to conduct the kakia<br>F together with our fire here<br>to and I just wanted to explain a couple<br>of things about it first and then it's<br>we're going to roll into it but there's<br>been a lot of statements made this<br>morning all of which will appear and be<br>referred to in these<br>Kia statements around<br>to or wa statements around taking what<br>you have learned and being champions for<br>us as a people and as we have referred<br>this morning to might be some Stormy<br>Waters Stormy Weather in front of us<br>while you're just plowing straight into<br>that K and the Kia is to help with<br>that KIA fumo though are supposed to be<br>interactive not just supposed to be<br>someone up here reciting some<br>incomprehensible words and then on Q you<br>go taiier not knowing what you are<br>supporting right that's not uh the ideal<br>approach and so I'm going to explain<br>what I'm going to do so that you can own<br>it so you can own it and I'm also going<br>to bring in a part of the of this fah<br>that you don't usually see and you may<br>not be familiar with it but it's the<br>ultimate and interaction so let me<br>explain there will be four colak here<br>the first three are about our colia to<br>our patrons of knowledge and the pursuit<br>when the second K is finished I'm going<br>to ask you three<br>questions and this is the interactive<br>part and these questions I'm going to<br>explain them in English now because I'm<br>not going to be translating them when<br>I'm doing them right question number<br>one asks are you going to protect<br>cherish and nourish the knowledge that<br>you have gained while studying here and<br>you will be invited at the end to say I<br>or C<br>A and I think being the fact you're<br>graduates of this highly esteemed<br>institution you'll know which answer is<br>the right<br>one the second question is going to be<br>are you going to use that<br>knowledge for the benefit of our<br>people to help with the stormy waters<br>ahead to make this world a better place<br>that'll be question two and at the end<br>they'll be asking again I called it<br>an and then the third one will be asking<br>are you going to look after each other<br>going forward from here to look after<br>each other and to help each other in<br>life's challenges and life's Pathways<br>that lie in front of you so those are<br>the three questions and I will hold up<br>my finger like this so you know when<br>I've got to them all right and I will<br>pause and give you the<br>right when you get when you to answer<br>those questions but by answering I those<br>those statements move from being<br>two you will protect and look after the<br>knowledge you've earned gained you will<br>use it for the benefit of others and you<br>will maintain the connections and look<br>after each other so just focus focus on<br>that for a second and I'm going to come<br>down to the middle here to do this cuz<br>I'm feeling a bit of aoha for those<br>right at the end all right it's easy<br>enough for me
