an address by one of our newest<br>graduates who speaks on behalf of their<br>peers this honor is awarded to someone<br>who during their time at the university<br>has exemplified the qualities we seek to<br>instill in all our<br>graduates this afternoon's address will<br>be given by<br>Joseph fromo<br>andata who has graduated with a bachelor<br>of science with honors majoring in<br>physics during his time at to heading<br>aaka Joseph has shared his excitement<br>for science with many as a tutor mentor<br>and currently as a radio<br>DJ his excitement and efforts have led<br>to many<br>opportunities Jo Joseph has been<br>involved in various projects from<br>collaborating with regional councils on<br>quantifying geothermal use on studying<br>used to studying granular flow using<br>MRI recently Joseph has been occupied by<br>problems in condensed matter theory in<br>particular with Quantum transport and<br>Nano<br>structures questions about how the roles<br>of quantum mechanics might be taken<br>advantage of in future technologies have<br>inspired him to obtain his PhD which he<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome<br>address thank<br>who<br>that proverb is one that I really like<br>and I wanted to share with you it uses<br>the central part of the flex plant as a<br>metaphor for the people that make up a<br>prosperous Community describing new<br>growth's importance to the survival of<br>the plant so that we may might continue<br>to hear the song of<br>BDS in the second half it becomes less<br>cryptic simply saying if you ask me what<br>is the most important thing in this<br>world it is people it is people it is<br>people that is what today is for<br>recognizing you the graduates for the<br>hard work it has taken to get here as<br>well as those who we owe our gratitude<br>for a helping hand along the way thank<br>you to the organizers for letting me up<br>here uh I'm grateful that I was asked to<br>do this I hope I can just give a quick<br>talk that is fun and celebrates each of<br>you when asked to prepare this speech<br>I was surprised that graduates would be<br>attending from such a broad range of<br>disciplines I'm not sure<br>why um I asked myself what is common<br>between them how do I celebrate each of<br>them we all come from such a diverse uh<br>range of<br>backgrounds and let me tell you first<br>what is obvious to me from standing up<br>here in front of me I see a room full of<br>graduates that I know have spent<br>tireless hours over long nights<br>preparing for tests reading texts uh uh<br>and chipping away at assigned work<br>sometimes when it is due the next day it<br>is one of the great mini skills learned<br>over the course of a degree how to<br>thrive in the last<br>minute even so I think it is a safe<br>assumption that if you sum the hours<br>spent working hard amongst the graduates<br>just sitting in front of me I think it's<br>safe to assume that that number would be<br>really<br>large and I think about about that and I<br>draw inspiration from it from the width<br>of knowledge that represents over so<br>many of the Great disciplines<br>represented here today and I am glad<br>that our Collective efforts are being<br>recognized So In This Moment appreciate<br>your own efforts but also those of The<br>Graduate seated around you for today as<br>we so rightly should be we should all be<br>very proud though mentioning only our<br>own fits leaves a rather incomplete<br>description each of us has has led lives<br>outside of our academic<br>Pursuits with our own family friends and<br>some number of personal interests and as<br>our responsibilities have grown life has<br>probably become quite The Balancing Act<br>I know it has for me and these<br>qualifications we are leaving here with<br>today have taken a number of years to<br>obtain over which time I'm sure for each<br>of you there were moments that were<br>probably pretty tough and often times<br>that burden is lessened or relieved by<br>the people that we surround us ourselves<br>with so I'd like to take a moment to<br>thank those people the mentors the role<br>models the family the<br>friends both to get us on the path that<br>has got us here today as well as for the<br>encouragement that has kept us on it the<br>achievements we are recognizing today<br>are as much an acknowledgement of our<br>own efforts as they are yours thank you<br>also I'd like to extend uh thank you to<br>the academic faculty who have offered us<br>with a worldclass education that has<br>made every graduate leaving here today<br>better off than when they arrived it's<br>been an incredible journey with highs<br>and lows but today is also a ceremonial<br>way to turn our gaze towards the future<br>and envision the exciting possibilities<br>that lie<br>ahead each graduate will be leaving here<br>with a piece of paper that represents<br>the relationships forged challenges<br>overcome and Good Times had<br>and now that chapter of our journey has<br>come to a<br>close and things might begin to change<br>quickly for all of us for our<br>responsibilities will grow<br>again just as they did when we first<br>arrived at University I know that this<br>has been the case for me however change<br>also brings opportunity and I've learned<br>that for the most part it is best to<br>dive into change head first and embrace<br>it that attitude has been necessary as I<br>transition from an enthusiastic young<br>student to a young theoretical<br>physicist and although not everyone<br>needs to know how to write down<br>solutions to shing his equation there is<br>one word that continues to show up in my<br>conversations that I think connects the<br>graduates across the many represented<br>disciplines here you learned it right at<br>the beginning of your academic Journey<br>probably when you only a few feet to<br>that is the word why it is such an<br>important word just that one word<br>invokes curiosity more easily than any<br>other way and it is curiosity that<br>drives our Discovery and Innovation it's<br>what's Driven each of us to get this far<br>in our study maintaining that disc uh<br>that Curiosity our pursuit of Discovery<br>just by simply asking yourself why that<br>helps us get to the bottom of problems<br>and find Solutions but<br>moreover it will help us move through<br>change successfully by helping us to<br>make decisions that are grounded in our<br>passions and move through our lives with<br>meaning because we know what matters<br>most to<br>us I started with a faki so let me end<br>with one more one which speaks to the<br>challenges and opportunities which we<br>will all face when we leave here<br>toah it means seek the treasures you<br>value most dearly and if you bow your<br>head let it be to a lofty mountain in<br>other words pursue your destiny<br>persevere and don't let obstacles defeat<br>you or put one more way have<br>aspirations set your own goals and when<br>you leave here today don't let things<br>like insignificant mountains get in your<br>way thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
