and<br>design<br>Innovation The Faculty of engineering<br>and<br>T The Faculty of health<br>and the faculty of science I am<br>Professor daan hins Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor Marty and engagement and your<br>MC for this<br>ceremony I am delighted you could join<br>us this afternoon to celebrate the<br>achievements of your family member<br>friend or<br>colleague as well as being proud<br>Spectators you are also formal witnesses<br>to these official proceedings a very<br>warm welcome also to Faro and Friends<br>throughout alel and from across the<br>globe viewing these proceeding<br>proceedings via our live stream I would<br>now like to introduce to you the<br>chancellor of tading aaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington this is a role<br>that dates back to the Middle Ages when<br>the first universities were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the university strategic<br>directions ladies and gentlemen the<br>a<br>to<br>ten aoto John Allen too inoa uh it's<br>good to see everyone here this is a<br>celebration so I expect singing and<br>dancing I expect noise and I expect<br>celebratory actions as people come<br>across the<br>stage it's a celebration of our students<br>and their success your perseverance your<br>persistence your intelligence your drive<br>and ultimately your success it<br>recognizes all your Fano your supporters<br>your family your friends and all those<br>who've helped make this possible for you<br>and we celebrate them as well it also<br>salutes the many academics and<br>professional staff of this University<br>who have supported you many of whom are<br>behind me and are waiting with great<br>pride uh to see their students<br>uh come across the stage and it<br>recognizes in a public forum in a public<br>way the the importance of this<br>University in this city in this country<br>and in our<br>world now I know ladies and gentlemen<br>that there are lots of things that<br>people don't like about universities<br>that watch this procession coming in<br>today and they'd say my God the the<br>chancellors from the uh from the<br>medieval times that was just announced<br>by the MC and basically it looks as<br>though all the rest of them are pretty<br>much from the Medieval Times too of<br>course they're completely wrong what we<br>have is these academics behind me what I<br>call the brains Trust of the University<br>uh who are steeped in thousands of years<br>of learning and lived experience of<br>multiple Traditions across the globe and<br>then what happens every year is they<br>intersect with a new generation of<br>students a generation who bring the<br>Contemporary issues of their time the<br>challenges and the opportunities to that<br>uh engagement and it's the Alchemy of of<br>of the institution when those things<br>meet that's when the Brilliance occurs<br>that's why people who think we're past<br>it are completely wrong there are of<br>course people who think that uh<br>expertise is out that you can Google<br>anything you can AI the rest and really<br>why on Earth would you bother uh with<br>all of this and those those people are<br>completely wrong as well the truth is<br>that in an age of demagogues and Ai and<br>misinformation you need to be able to<br>think for yourself the truth is that in<br>an age of the challenges we are<br>currently facing whether it's climate<br>change or pandemic or War you need the<br>expertise of true learned persons to be<br>able to Grapple and resolve those issues<br>and I want to recognize all of the<br>people who are going to graduate as phds<br>today there are messes of them and there<br>are years of learning that are<br>represented in those red outfits that<br>they're wearing that's why I don't wear<br>a red outfit the years of learning uh<br>that they are representing and I want to<br>say to them expertise matters I want to<br>say to them that the future of our<br>planet and our ability to Grapple with<br>the major challenges that we face as a<br>country in a world depends on people<br>like you people like the the academics<br>behind me who have been prepared to<br>invest serious time uh to develop the<br>expertise uh that you have now I know<br>that there are lots of challenges so I<br>thought a bit of poetry was required uh<br>I know that this is a science and uh<br>design uh Forum but I also know that at<br>the heart of science is creativity I<br>know that at the heart of science it's<br>that magic moment when you know all the<br>basics you've learned all the basics and<br>you can make the leap uh into the<br>unknown and unlock some new insight or<br>some new treasure and so there's a poem<br>that I just wanted to give you it's it's<br>a bit of a gloomy poem to be perfectly<br>honest uh but it's gloomy for a reason<br>it was written by B do Breck the German<br>uh playright uh and poet uh and he wrote<br>it just after World the second world war<br>and as you can imagine he had just been<br>through two world wars he's been<br>concentration camps had been exported to<br>other countries around the world so it's<br>it's a little bit Bleak uh but<br>nonetheless just hold with me for a<br>moment as as we I'll get it basically<br>right if any of you know the poem I<br>probably get bits wrong just interject<br>the words that I've uh uh that I've<br>missed it's a it's a conversation with a<br>general and it goes like this uh General<br>your tank is indeed a powerful thing it<br>can flatten forests and crush a 100<br>people<br>yet there is one thing wrong with it it<br>needs a<br>driver General your bomber flies faster<br>than the storm winds and Carries more<br>than an elephant but there is one thing<br>wrong with it it needs a<br>mechanic General human beings are useful<br>they can fly they can uh they can kill<br>but there's one thing wrong with them<br>they can think<br>now I want to say to you that what bck<br>or brick was doing there was affirming<br>universities I want to say to you he<br>didn't necessarily know that but he was<br>affirming universities he was affirming<br>the reality that if we want to get rid<br>of War any more than pestilence and<br>plague and all the other things that<br>confront us we need people who can<br>think and so in that spirit I want to<br>recognize the importance of the<br>University because we have a statut<br>we're required by law we would be<br>breaking the law if we didn't think we<br>would be breaking the law because we<br>have to create Our obligation under the<br>ACT is to create intellectual<br>Independence uh in our students is to<br>teach and research at an international<br>St to an international standard is to be<br>a repository of expertise is to be a<br>Critic and conscience of society that is<br>the<br>obligation of this University to drive<br>thinking and of course we have a secret<br>weapon a magic Source I suppose they'd<br>call it in modern marketing terminology<br>uh that helps us do that it's called<br>academic freedom and what academic<br>freedom says is that our academics and<br>our students can do some pretty<br>spectacular things you can question<br>received wisdom you can come up with new<br>thinking and new ideas and you can<br>express opinions which are<br>controversial is another word too but<br>basically that are controversial people<br>don't like that's that I'm I'm<br>paraphrasing what the actual ERS but<br>nonetheless so that's the purpose of a<br>university and we're here today to<br>celebrate you as thinkers we're here<br>today to celebrate you as dreamers we're<br>here today to celebrate your potential<br>because we believe that the thinking<br>that you do the way that you do it that<br>detailed understanding that you've<br>developed here is the solution to most<br>of the challenges in the world now of<br>course you'll say to me actually the<br>internet's displac most of it actually<br>I'd rather tweet or X or whatever it is<br>your particular poison is and I can get<br>all of that information actually it's<br>not as valuable as you think and you are<br>fundamentally wrong uh in that<br>assumption there's a a wonderful book<br>written by a man called Nicholas Carr<br>many of you will have read called the<br>shallows and what he talks about is the<br>impact of the social media frenzy that's<br>caught us all on our thinking and the<br>way in which we think and what he said<br>is that the linear thinking style this<br>is getting a bit deep I know but<br>nonetheless you expect some substance<br>from a Chancellor in these sorts of<br>addresses the linear thinking style uh<br>which started with the Gutenberg Press<br>and has been right through the<br>Renaissance and the Industrial<br>Revolution even the modernist movement<br>now he said it's at risk he feels as a<br>consequence of all of this change of<br>being displaced and a matter of history<br>and what I want to say to him is if you<br>want to stop war read War and Peace<br>I want to say to him if you want to stop<br>war read The Iliad I want to say to him<br>if you want to inspire people read the<br>the stories of the peoples of the world<br>you need deep understanding you need<br>deep knowledge and I want to salute all<br>of you uh in your achievement one last<br>poem and then I'll go uh be I'll be back<br>to say shake your hand with great pride<br>I might say but but<br>nonetheless I I wanted one last poem<br>it's from isra pound and I suppose the<br>point I want make with this is thinking<br>well fantastic is not enough action is<br>also required and you know that our<br>scientists are at the moment in<br>Antarctica drilling through the ice<br>sheets from the Antarctic Research<br>Center uh you know that at the FIA<br>they're developing a solution for<br>malaria uh around the world you know in<br>the Robinson they're developing uh Ultra<br>Ultra efficient engines for aircraft and<br>other Transport Solutions that will be<br>sustainable uh on our planet you know<br>that in the architecture school we're<br>designing new approaches to housing that<br>will address and help address the<br>affordable housing crisis and meet the<br>challenges of seismicity and other<br>things that we have uh in this country<br>you know that action is occurring but I<br>want to call you to action as well I<br>dealt with this little poem it's an is p<br>again it's wee bit gloomy but<br>nonetheless it's short uh and it goes<br>like this and the days were not full<br>enough and the nights were not full<br>enough and life slipped by like a field<br>mouse hardly shaking the grass and I<br>want to say to you as graduates of<br>taring a walker a university which<br>believes in Action a university which<br>believes in Progressive change a<br>university which believes in constantly<br>challenging constantly questioning we<br>expect you to get out there and shake<br>the grass we expect you to make a<br>difference we expect you to contribute<br>to your discipline in this country and<br>around the world and we salute and<br>celebrate with you on this success that<br>thato the chancellor w now recognize the<br>graduates as listed in the graduation<br>program will all degree diploma and<br>certificate graduates please<br>stand if you want to come up on the<br>stage you need to stand up yeah this<br>this is an important moment because this<br>is when you actually sort of get<br>recognized really all

so<br>passionately<br>coherently and enthusiastically argued<br>all universities and this University in<br>particular have a fundamental role in<br>enriching knowledge creativity and the<br>diverse ways we have of understanding<br>the world and research is one of those<br>key contributions that we make to<br>society our doctoral graduates achieve<br>academically at the very highest level<br>and their research provides insights<br>into the increasingly existential and<br>important questions that we have as a<br>society it's incre increasingly<br>difficult in that contemporary world to<br>separate sometimes expertise from<br>opinion and these graduates have spent<br>several years learning their craft to do<br>exactly that they can help us understand<br>the past the present and possible<br>Futures they're independent thinkers and<br>makers who are actively engaged AS<br>Global Citizens we are very proud to<br>know them we are very proud of what<br>they've done and we're very

newest<br>graduates who speaks on behalf of their<br>PE this honor is awarded to someone who<br>during their time at the university has<br>exemplified the qualities we seek to<br>instill in all our<br>graduates this afternoon's address will<br>be given by Joseph P fromo<br>andata who has graduated with a Bachelor<br>of Science with honors majoring in<br>physics during his time at to heading<br>aaka Joseph has shared his excitement<br>for science with many as a tutor mentor<br>and currently as a radio teer<br>J his excitement and efforts have led to<br>many<br>opportunities Jo Joseph has been<br>involved in various projects from<br>collaborating with regional councils on<br>quantifying geothermal use on studying<br>or used to studying granular flow using<br>MRI recently Joseph has been occupied by<br>problems and condensed matter theory in<br>particular with Quantum transport and<br>nanostructure<br>rures questions about how the rules of<br>quantum mechanics might be taken<br>advantage of in future technologies have<br>inspired him to obtain his PhD which he<br>hopes to begin sometime next<br>year ladies and Gentlemen please welcome<br>address<br>thank<br>quick that proverb is one that I really<br>like and I wanted to share with you it<br>uses the central part of the flex plant<br>as a metaphor for the people that make<br>up a prosperous Community describing new<br>growth's importance to the survival of<br>the plant so that we may might continue<br>to hear the song of<br>bellbirds in the second half it becomes<br>less cryptic simply saying if you ask me<br>what is the most important thing in this<br>world it is people it is people it is<br>people that is what today is for<br>recognizing you the graduates for the<br>hard work it has taken to get here<br>as well as those who we owee our<br>gratitude for a helping hand along the<br>way thank you to the organizers for<br>letting me up here uh I'm grateful that<br>I was asked to do this I hope I can just<br>give a quick talk that is fun and<br>celebrates each of you when asked to<br>prepare this speech I was surprised that<br>graduates would be attending from such a<br>broad range of disciplines I'm not sure<br>why um I asked myself what is common<br>between them how do I celebrate each of<br>them we all come from such a diverse uh<br>range of<br>backgrounds and let me tell you first<br>what is obvious to me from standing up<br>here in front of me I see a room full of<br>graduates that I know have spent<br>tireless hours over long nights<br>preparing for tests reading<br>texts uh and tripping away at assigned<br>work sometimes when it is due the next<br>day it is one of the great many skills<br>learned over the course of a degree how<br>to thrive in the last<br>minute even so I think it is safe<br>assumption that if you sum the hours<br>spent working hard amongst the graduates<br>just sitting in front of me I think it's<br>safe to assume that that number would be<br>really<br>large and I think about that and I draw<br>inspiration from it from the width of<br>knowledge that represents over so many<br>of the Great disciplines represented<br>here<br>today and I am glad that our Collective<br>efforts are being recognized So In This<br>Moment appreciate your own efforts but<br>also those of the graduates seated<br>around you for today as we so rightly<br>should be we should all be very proud<br>though mentioning only our own efforts<br>leaves a rather incomplete<br>description each of us has led lives<br>outside of our academic<br>Pursuits with our own family friends and<br>some number of personal interests and as<br>our responsibilities have grown life has<br>probably become quite The Balancing Act<br>I know it has for me and these qual<br>ifications we are leaving here with<br>today have taken a number of years to<br>obtain over which time I'm sure for each<br>of you there were moments that were<br>probably pretty tough and often times<br>that burden is lessen or relieved by the<br>people that we surround ourselves with<br>so I'd like to take a moment to thank<br>those people the mentors the role models<br>the family the<br>friends both to get us on the path that<br>has got us here today as well as for the<br>encouragement that has kept us on it the<br>achievements we are recognizing today<br>are as much an acknowledgement of our<br>own efforts as they are yours thank you<br>also I'd like to extend uh thank you to<br>the academic faculty who have offered us<br>with a worldclass education that has<br>made every graduate leaving here today<br>better off than when they arrived it's<br>been an incredible journey with highs<br>and lows but today is also a ceremonial<br>way to turn our gaze towards the future<br>and envision the exciting possibilities<br>that lie<br>ahead each graduate will be leaving here<br>with a piece of paper that represents<br>the relationships forged challenges<br>overcome and Good Times had and now that<br>chapter of our journey has come to a<br>close and things might begin to change<br>quickly for all of us for our<br>responsibilities will grow<br>again just as they did when we first<br>arrived at University I know that this<br>has been the case for me however change<br>also brings opportunity and I've learned<br>that for the most part it is best to<br>dive into change head first and embrace<br>it that attitude has been necessary as a<br>transition from an enthusiastic young<br>student to a young theoretical<br>physicist and although not everyone<br>needs to know how to write down<br>solutions to shing his equation there is<br>one word that continues to show up in my<br>conversation<br>that I think connects the graduates<br>across the many represented disciplines<br>here you learned it right at the<br>beginning of your academic Journey<br>probably when you're only a few feet<br>tall that is the word why it is such an<br>important word just that one word<br>invokes curiosity more easily than any<br>other way and it is curiosity that<br>drives our Discovery and Innovation it's<br>what's Driven each of us to get this far<br>in our study maintaining that disc uh<br>that Curiosity our pursuit of Discovery<br>just by simply asking yourself why that<br>helps us get to the bottom of problems<br>and find Solutions but<br>moreover it will help us move through<br>change successfully by helping us to<br>make decisions that are grounded in our<br>passions and move through our lives with<br>meaning because we know what matters<br>most to<br>us I started with a faki so let me end<br>with one more one which speaks to the<br>challenges and opportunities which we<br>will all face when we leave here<br>kahur it means seek the treasures you<br>value most dearly and if you bow your<br>head let it be to a lofty mountain in<br>other words pursue your destiny<br>persevere and don't let obstacles defeat<br>you or put one more way have aspirations<br>set your own goals and when you leave<br>here today don't let things like<br>insignificant mountains get in your way<br>thank<br>you<br>thank you Joseph uh starting with that<br>wonderful um<br>H uh they they bellbird on the flex bush<br>reminded me of Wendell Berry's great<br>poem where he talked about planting<br>trees in early spring to make a place<br>for birds to sing in times to come and I<br>think what you're pointing to is that<br>that actually is the role the<br>responsibility and the reality uh of the<br>University because you're the singing<br>birds graduates just to give give you<br>the analogy<br>um I also really like the question why<br>because lots of people think that um<br>experts are sort of arrogant people<br>people who tell you all the answers but<br>I think if you ask the people behind me<br>what they would say is they ask the<br>questions uh and that their whole<br>Foundation of their study uh is based on<br>what uh the great Peter MZ who was an<br>academic here said uh was the certainty<br>of<br>doubt this afternoon has been a<br>celebration of your achievements and is<br>a formal that's yours the graduates uh<br>and as a celebration of the formal<br>acknowledgement of your admittance to<br>the community of schol Scholars at this<br>University although you may have<br>completed your association with
