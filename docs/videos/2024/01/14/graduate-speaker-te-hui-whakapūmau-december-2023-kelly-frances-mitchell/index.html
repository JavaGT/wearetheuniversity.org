honor to speak today<br>graduating I started as a student here<br>in<br>2018 and today I'm graduating with a<br>bachelor of laws and a Bachelor of Arts<br>double majoring in Mari and Mii<br>studies<br>K I'm also beginning a masters of law<br>here at Ted aaka and I'm an assistant<br>lecturer of law at the faculty of law<br>down at pip campus campus uh so even<br>though I'm graduating today I will be<br>back here on Monday for work and I will<br>be studying here for a little while<br>longer uh to know what you are getting<br>into with this cord all and because I'm<br>now in the habit of giving learning<br>objectives uh I want to give you a heads<br>up that this cordor is just a big series<br>of Mii to all the wonderful people here<br>so be ready for lots of<br>gushing I arrived at Ted aaka like many<br>to Mai with less than ideal connection<br>to my Papa to<br>to Mari this weak connection had been<br>bugging me during my later years of high<br>school and in 2017 I received some<br>advice from a senior member of our Mii<br>the and she told me that the best step<br>for reconciling thatu was to learn so I<br>came here to do that I teched lore on<br>the side because I was big into some<br>political movements and still am that<br>utiliz legal expertise and because I'd<br>watched my mom who's here today study to<br>become a lawyer and then work as one and<br>she made it look like a piece of cake uh<br>which I should have known was a<br>mirage in fact to be completely honest I<br>was overconfident in every respect<br>regarding how easy it would be to learn<br>all that I wanted to learn here and<br>nothing more so than the challenge it<br>would be to learn to all secondary toel<br>Learners will know this but you never<br>really learn Tido as a language the<br>lessons are not limited to the language<br>to the grammar the syntax the kopu but<br>extend to all matters of CHA history<br>faka Papa and even dress code to learn<br>the language you must adopt it into your<br>life you must reconnect proper find<br>kurel move in circles with other<br>speakers which if you'd rather be a<br>hermit like me is more challenging than<br>reading any<br>textbook um and naturally that this<br>means that there is no harder job than<br>teaching aell aell lecturers at tting<br>aaka do do not limit our learnings to<br>just the language but instruct on these<br>Tik history faka Papa<br>Mara they act as quasi therapists for<br>the occasional student Chase up essays<br>from other students at land occupations<br>support student run Copa and are forced<br>into the public eye as champions of the<br>language a position which attracts a lot<br>of public scrutiny our M studies<br>lecturers and my m lecturers at the law<br>school fill similar support roles for<br>students and advocacy positions within<br>the<br>university um and within the wider<br>Community their individual and<br>Collective resilience is<br>unmatched uh therefore on behalf of the<br>TOA graduating today I want to give the<br>first acknowledgement to those lecturers<br>tutors and Kim and if I may be selfish<br>name those who supported me since I can<br>uh<br>so an T Matthews who's graduating today<br>as well but who was myia M studies<br>cheater and first Mike Ross Vinnie Olen<br>Rita Kelli Peter EDS Carn Jones Luke<br>Stevens um although the last six years<br>have been spent in lectures and<br>tutorials with those wonderful teachers<br>getting these degrees it would be<br>incorrect to say that the learning has<br>been done exclusively in those spaces at<br>least and perhaps especially for th Mii<br>the learning comes from being alongside<br>each other the best thing to have<br>happened to me at University was<br>becoming involved in my M student<br>cohorts through the mar law Students<br>Association and the mai Students<br>Association from indepth warer on TI<br>compliant constitutional change to<br>having tiny tomana quite literally grabb<br>my arms to teach me how to move po<br>correctly we support each other in all<br>matter of ways to become the best Mii I<br>like to think that I gave back in my own<br>way always being on hand for an essay<br>proof readed and definitely not giving<br>generous discounts to Dollar Red Bull<br>vodkas at the bar that I worked at on<br>the weekends to all my to Mar<br>Pals kutu to De Mari not only draw<br>learnings from each other but also<br>inspiration as Mali students we embark<br>on diverse academic Journeys each with<br>unique aspirations and dreams however<br>amidst the diversity there is a Common<br>Thread that weaves us together the<br>unwavering dedication to honor Tupa who<br>have paved the way for us and continue<br>Paving that way for the Tupa who will<br>come after us our Tupa walked Paths of<br>resilience uh wisdom and sacrifice and<br>in every warer exam late night study<br>session and perhaps even the Thursday<br>trip to the residents karaoke<br>competition we carry their aspirations<br>and successes on our shoulders<br>we are not simply TOA we are<br>torchbearers of a proud<br>fuckaa therefore the success that you<br>see today is not the student cohorts<br>alone it belongs to the collective to<br>the Faro who have supported us and who<br>come here today to<br>celebrate these students reference you<br>all constantly they talk about what<br>they've learned from you their desires<br>to succeed for you how proud they are to<br>be from you on behalf again of the<br>cohort<br>as we Revel in our achievements today<br>let us not confine our thoughts to our<br>immediate but extend our gaze to our<br>indigenous Faro around the world I<br>wanted to draw particular attention to<br>our Faro in Palestine who like us have<br>similar aspirations to honor their<br>POA but whose dreams have been marred or<br>otherwise destroyed by the realities of<br>invasion the pursuit of Education the<br>desire to honor tuna and the yearning to<br>create a better future for Al somebody<br>are Universal sentiments particularly<br>amongst indigenous communities however<br>for many of our communities these dreams<br>are stifled by circumstances beyond<br>their control our hearts ache for Alano<br>and Palestine and for our indigenous<br>communities globally who face<br>unimaginable<br>challenges today we stand here with the<br>privilege of education and the<br>opportunity it brings and with this<br>privilege become becomes a<br>responsibility a responsibility to<br>uplift and support those who share our<br>ambitions but who are denied the access<br>we often take for<br>granted in the face of adversity it is<br>our duty to become a Beacon of Hope as<br>we celebrate our success today let us<br>not forget those who denied the same<br>opportunities I implore each graduate to<br>consider the ways that we might be able<br>to contribute to the empowerment of our<br>Global indigenous Faro with this new<br>government<br>Deo it is even more imperative for us to<br>stand strong in our indigeny and and<br>affirm our rights and the rights of and<br>of<br>I hope that you all have K chest today<br>in response to this amazing achievement<br>I will always be endlessly in awe and<br>proud of TOA Mari if you'll allow me to<br>be cringe um the belief that I have in<br>TOA Mai is the reason that I stood<br>alongside for TOA and the reason that<br>I'm sticking around to work here at the<br>f um I hope that I want to see more<br>toari pursue these degrees and Achieve<br>them and I hope that one day when your<br>tamariki attends University you'll be<br>able to send them my way so that I can<br>support their success just as you have<br>supported mine and each other's to be<br>selfish for the final time I want to<br>acknowledge three graduates today who<br>have been great friends and supporters<br>during my studies here tenot Lissa taka<br>Ward<br>um<br>for<br>for</p></main><footer
