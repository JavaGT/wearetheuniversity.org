He particularly focuses on technological advancements, evolving business and stakeholder needs, and the impact of non-financial reporting (e.g. climate-related disclosures). In this Business Dean’s series he reflects on what this means for the accounting workforce of the future – and how adaptation and continuous learning will be needed to ensure globally accepted, high-quality, and understandable corporate financial reporting.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>a appropriately in that Mari greeting<br>it's uh welcoming people from all Four<br>Winds which I think this morning is<br>rather true um so good morning I'm Jan<br>Bryson I'm the dean of the Wellington<br>School of Business and government and<br>it's a real pleasure to welcome you all<br>here this morning um to this<br>xrb uh Victoria University of Wellington<br>seminar on the future of financial<br>reporting uh and it's a very great honor<br>to have um as guest speaker this morning<br>Dr Andreas Sparco chair of the<br>International Accounting Standards<br>Board um I will have Carolyn introduce<br>uh Andreas in a moment but I just wanted<br>to say that this is part of a a series<br>that started uh in May this year um<br>where the Wellington School of Business<br>and government wants to stimulate<br>discussions um of accounting for the<br>future um we believe accounting is<br>important to the future of business and<br>Society it's changing and is arguably<br>becoming more important um so in May<br>this year we hosted a Dean series<br>seminar on accounting for the future<br>with a Stella panel um headed by ail<br>McKenzie from xrb but also people from<br>audit New Zealand uh from cans and uh<br>people from within our own faculty and<br>they kicked off debate on challenges and<br>changes that face Accounting in the<br>future in particular the changing role<br>of the accountant change for<br>organizations which have to measure and<br>report on climate impacts of business<br>and greenhouse gas emissions adapt to<br>and develop digital reporting and AI<br>capacity uh and potential future<br>reporting requirements so this morning<br>we're really privileged um to be able to<br>continue that conversation uh looking at<br>the future for financial reporting with<br>an international speaker of the caliber<br>of um<br>Andreas um I have to give you a uh a few<br>um of the housekeeping instructions<br>which uh all the kiwis in the room will<br>be familiar with Don't Panic Andreas<br>you've probably heard this in Wellington<br>before uh just to remind people of the<br>emergency procedures for this building<br>uh for fire there will be an alarm uh we<br>leave the building using the nearest<br>fire exit which is the stairs so we can<br>exit out um either set of doors and the<br>stairs are obvious just follow someone<br>like me or uh another staff member uh<br>and we assemble in bunny Street which is<br>between us and the law<br>school uh earthquake it's the usual um<br>constructions drop cover and hold until<br>the shaking stops stay inside until it's<br>safe to exit um and only evacuate if<br>it's unsafe to to remain in the building<br>and<br>tsunami being by the harbor um if it's a<br>very strong earthquake uh then we will<br>exit the building we'll have to go down<br>the stairs and we will um hot foot it up<br>mwth Street um to the parliament for<br>court or actually I would preferably go<br>higher so um those are our emergency<br>instructions um if you need the the<br>toilets um they're on either side here<br>just a bit if you walk straight ahead<br>you'll see them on your right on that<br>side and on your left on that side so<br>that's all our procedures um the the<br>process this morning is Carin will come<br>and uh say a we bit about Andreas um he<br>will then um speak for approximately<br>half an hour yep um we will then uh go<br>into a Q&amp;A session that carolen will<br>manage the um the field the questions to<br>Pastor Andreas uh and we will aim to to<br>wind up by 9:00 a.m. uh the the<br>presentation is being recorded but when<br>we get to the Q&amp;A session we will stop<br>the recording so you'll um or Calvin's<br>here to to do that for us um so that you<br>you feel free to ask any question you<br>like and Andreas feels free to give any<br>answer he likes in the Q&amp;A session or no<br>answer at<br>all um so I'll call on Carolyn to to do<br>the<br>introductions thanks Jane and<br>k um lovely to have you with us on this<br>slightly blustery Wellington morning but<br>it's it's it's a great privilege to have<br>Andreas with us in New Zealand and as<br>you know he's the chair of the<br>International Accounting Standards Board<br>and you know for our students none of<br>whom of course have got up early enough<br>uh this morning to to come in but for uh<br>those of us who've been students you<br>might one might wonder how someone<br>becomes the iasb chair and Andrea shared<br>with us yesterday that he had five<br>interviews or five um sets of<br>presentations and interviews over over a<br>long period over a year in the middle of<br>co uh before he was selected and I think<br>he makes an ideal case study for a uh<br>for a standard CER because he also<br>shared with us that he did a very<br>General Degree uh at University and and<br>he wasn't as strong in accounting and<br>finance as he thought he should be and<br>so he started to really concentrate uh<br>on financial instruments and that what<br>his thesis is on so um if we want to<br>talk about derivatives this morning that<br>would be an area uh but through the<br>course of his career has uh being a<br>partner in deoe and Germany sat uh on<br>the German standard seter and cheered<br>that from 2015 to 2021 uh and that of<br>course gave him a seat at the European<br>financial reporting Advisory Group uh<br>eag which um you know takes on the iasb<br>standards and has so has been active in<br>standards sitting through through a<br>through an interest in uh in<br>International Accounting Standards so<br>he's really seen Germany's uh reactions<br>European reactions and now he uh gets to<br>travel the world and manage all of those<br>voices from emerging economies from very<br>large economies uh lots of people saying<br>please I want this change in the<br>standard or don't do that um and he is<br>very well placed to share with us this<br>morning the future of financial<br>reportings so I'll leave it to you<br>Andreas and thank you again for coming<br>to New Zealand a small country at the<br>bottom of the world but I know one<br>you've been to before that's right<br>thanks very much uh Kevin and Jane thank<br>you very much for the warm welcome uh<br>good morning to you in the room and good<br>morning to you um at the webinar um I<br>was almost tempted to say is there a<br>future for financial reporting and make<br>that the headline of my presentation but<br>I thought that might have been a bit<br>contentious especially as the chair of<br>the iasb so I say that is the future of<br>financial reporting but I give you a few<br>flavors as to um the challenges um that<br>we are facing at the moment um I was<br>told not to leave this spot so that<br>actually the camera which is just over<br>there could actually concentrate on me<br>um it looks a little bit that I'm hiding<br>behind my Cara so get your eggs and<br>tomatoes ready right so the shield will<br>come up<br>eventually in the Q&amp;A session I might<br>just wander a little bit more around<br>okay without further Ado uh let me start<br>um it's all good to think about the<br>future of financial reporting but I<br>think we all have to um just acknowledge<br>that we are not operating in a vacuum I<br>sometimes in the is be with a super<br>tanker and if the captain on the bridge<br>says all machines stop the thing would<br>just go for 30 natic miles straight<br>right before you could actually think<br>about okay should we probably have taken<br>a left turn or a right turn the ISB is<br>very similar in that regard not that way<br>are lazy not that we are slow but good<br>decent standard setting actually takes<br>some time and um many practitioners are<br>just scared if I tell them a decent<br>standard probably takes eight to 10<br>years to<br>develop and then they yours drop is said<br>you must be joking I mean budgeting for<br>next year is one year cycle midterm<br>planning is 3 to 5 years and everything<br>there after is science fiction so 8 10<br>years from now I would be happy<br>pensioner so okay bother my successes<br>with that so why is it taking so long<br>I'm not going to talk to that happy to<br>reserve that for the Q&amp;A if you want but<br>I thought i' give you a little bit of a<br>flavor what we are doing generally so uh<br>we're best known as the international<br>standard Setter which is obviously true<br>that we do far more than just setting<br>and developing standards or amending<br>existing standards that occupies us<br>approximately to 50% of our time a good<br>20% of our time goes into what you see<br>in the centers of the circle stakeholder<br>engagement so trips like this and it's<br>not just the privilege of the share that<br>I can pick all the the nice holiday<br>destinations that I would have loved to<br>go to um but all my uh 13 colleagues are<br>doing the same thing and our staff does<br>as well so we're taking stakeholder<br>engagement very very seriously because<br>if you have to look after 140 plus<br>jurisdictions around the globe um you<br>need to understand the environment that<br>they operate in you need to understand<br>the challenges and you can't just do<br>that remotely from sitting in a cozy<br>chair in London you really have to make<br>an effort and understand that and engage<br>with various parties so we take that<br>quite seriously another 25% uh goes into<br>what we call maintenance in consistent<br>application that's basically the work of<br>the interpretations committee and<br>limited amendments to our standards um<br>and the remaining 5% uh about go into to<br>the bottom left um um quadrant which is<br>digital financial reporting now you see<br>digital financial reporting still listed<br>in here as a separate domain um we<br>rather think of it as being part of<br>Standards development because we no<br>longer differentiate whether you're<br>developing a paper-based version or<br>digital version We believe that the<br>future has to go digital and you can't<br>think about digital implications once<br>the standard is fit so you really have<br>to think about any digital implications<br>as you develop the standard because you<br>have to be precise if one thing doesn't<br>exist in it it's fuzziness well that's<br>not entirely true I work at the chair<br>for statistics and one of um my um<br>colleagues over there actually was the<br>co-inventor of fuzzy logic and he would<br>tell you well you can you can work about<br>it but you have to be precise that's<br>what I'm really saying and you can't<br>just put out fuzzy requirements you have<br>to be really concrete and if you think<br>about digital that forces you to be<br>precise so we really merge the two what<br>you're seeing on the slide is some 20<br>projects that we are currently having on<br>our agenda they're all there for a<br>purpose uh and I tend to say that<br>because um the majority of our board<br>members have started their work uh in<br>the last three years the majority of<br>those standards uh the standard<br>development program actually have<br>existed for a far longer time so we are<br>now faced with something that our<br>predecessors decided we should be<br>focusing on and and several of my<br>colleagues have scratched their hair and<br>said why on Earth are we dealing with<br>this who who was the dull guy who<br>actually put this onto the agenda um but<br>there is a reason obviously everything<br>that we are doing is evidence-based so<br>if you see something in here it has<br>stimulated interest by some stakeholder<br>in the<br>past so if we thinking about the future<br>I think this is the one back stop we do<br>have a work program that we are working<br>on and the majority of our capacity is<br>being occupied by that so if you want us<br>to focus on something extra the shiny<br>future then you need to tell me what has<br>to go right because it's all good to put<br>on new stuff and to prioritize other<br>things but you also have to tell me<br>which things I should be deprioritizing<br>just keep that in mind so changing user<br>demands and digital reporting's role in<br>meeting these<br>challenges so this slide just gives you<br>a flavor of the different environments<br>that we are working with it's all good<br>to think about um in an abstract way<br>about what would the future ideal<br>coroporate reportive system look like<br>but we have to realize that the 140 plus<br>jurisdictions that we are serving<br>actually are quite diverse they're<br>culturally diverse they're in different<br>states of their Economic Development we<br>deal with emerging economies with<br>developing nations we have the G7 G20<br>not all of them but several of them and<br>they make themselves hurt uh quite often<br>um you do have different levels of<br>experiences and different availability<br>of resources in companies so just give<br>you one little touch point one of our<br>most recent standards was ifra 17 that<br>focuses on insurance<br>contracts if you think about a<br>jurisdiction such as Sri Lanka they do<br>have 10 actuaries in the entire<br>country so how do you apply a new<br>standard that is highly based on<br>Actuarial assumption<br>if you only have 10 xes in the country<br>and we may all smile about this and say<br>well good thing right um yeah but there<br>is a valid concern by these<br>jurisdictions how do we cope with that<br>and if you think about uh it's very easy<br>for a jurisdiction to say well I'm not B<br>the sard and that to me obviously is a<br>worry as a standard set that because the<br>entire story about if fors is only works<br>if everyone picks up the standards<br>unchanged and unchanged also means at<br>the effective date that we set right uh<br>you can't just uh ignore these concerns<br>that exist on the jurisdictional level<br>you have to take that seriously and find<br>Solutions well then there are different<br>objectives I've been on a tour to Latin<br>America and I learned that many latam<br>countries are using ifrss across the<br>board for everything not just for<br>Consolidated financial statements for<br>which they were designed they use that<br>for statutory reporting for tax<br>accounting for credential<br>oversight and God knows what<br>else and then they're incurring several<br>challenges well that doesn't come as a<br>surprise because tax accounting has a<br>quite different objective than financial<br>reporting credential oversight has a<br>different objective than financial<br>reporting so if you see conflicting<br>objectives it doesn't come as a surprise<br>that jurisdiction are crying for help<br>and actually crying for resolutions so<br>what do we deal with do with that do we<br>just say well<br>and on you you shouldn't have picked it<br>for that purpose or do we try to do<br>something about<br>it and different professional objectives<br>so you see the different stakeholder<br>groups that we are having and uh I<br>realized that talking in a university<br>one actually I missed out which is<br>academics but forgive me um so what's<br>our framework in terms of digital I said<br>that digital is really the future if you<br>um think about your day-to-day life most<br>things have gone<br>digital right I still remember the times<br>where I used this to take a call right<br>now I'm booking my holidays cars making<br>restaurant um reservation and all of<br>that you can do everything<br>digitally you can listen to music<br>through streaming you can watch movies<br>through streaming you can read<br>newspapers on your<br>device the one thing you can't do is do<br>financial reporting in a digital way<br>because everything is digitized within<br>the company but the ultimate thing for<br>it to actually prepare an annual report<br>is to press one button which is called<br>print that doesn't make an awful lot of<br>sense so if the economy is going digital<br>shouldn't financial reporting be part of<br>that as well and there's a strong<br>selling case for that if you go back in<br>history 25 years when the iasb was<br>erected its key selling point was to<br>equip multinational companies with what<br>otherwise is known as a global passport<br>that means a uniform set of roads that<br>you apply to your financial statements<br>and you could use those financial<br>statements to list anywhere around the<br>globe that was the key selling<br>Mission this Mission has<br>changed because now it's no longer<br>entities going abroad it's investors<br>coming<br>in so you don't have to go to n or to<br>the UK Stock Exchange you can sit at<br>home and wait for investors coming in<br>but they will only come in if they can<br>access the data and the information in<br>an easy way and in a way that is<br>commensurate to their<br>understanding and this is where digital<br>kicks in because if users can't access<br>the information in a very quick and<br>commensurate way if they only have to<br>deal with paper or at best with a pdf<br>version they would just say that's too<br>hard so either I make you pay a premium<br>for that or I would just bypass New<br>Zealand and say thank you very much see<br>you next<br>time and whether we like to hear that or<br>not that's just a reality digital<br>reporting is a means it's not the end<br>but is a means to actually funnel down<br>investment decisions to see the entire<br>universe and do a quick scan about<br>things that may be worthy of being<br>investment so we try to um feed into<br>that by producing what we call an i<br>tonomy which is basically nothing else<br>than a dictionary of all our<br>requirements to enable machine readable<br>financial<br>reporting that is what we are doing so a<br>taxonomy is nothing else than the<br>machine re version of the same<br>paper-based format that you know that<br>the financial reports are we develop<br>those ifs taxonomies we do that inhouse<br>and we as I said we do that concurrently<br>with the development of the standards<br>themselves but we rely on other partners<br>in the ecosystem so we have strong ties<br>to xprl International we obviously work<br>a lot with the audit profession and with<br>The Regulators because we can set the<br>standards but we can't enforce them we<br>can't mandate them on anyone so we need<br>others to help actually promate what we<br>are doing and to actually ring fence the<br>quality that is attached to that now why<br>is that important um let me just um skip<br>that Sky because I think I have already<br>alluded to that probably just one remark<br>if you see the term digital financial<br>reporting be mindful that different<br>people have different understandings as<br>to what this means right so I present<br>you a very narrow version of that<br>digital reporting means using our<br>taxonomy and facilitating digital<br>consumption of um reports you could<br>obvious have a far more far-reaching<br>um um an an emerging view of digital<br>reporting if you you think about AI uh<br>if you think about uh Mass consumption<br>if you think about realtime consumption<br>and preparation of data so there are<br>different facets about digital reporting<br>but if I say the ISB deals with<br>financial reporting digital financial<br>reporting we are keeping the narrow View<br>for the moment at least because you<br>still want us to develop some<br>standards um I think the bigger picture<br>I don't want you to read the slid right<br>um it's not meant to be an test um but<br>it's there to actually um pinpoint that<br>digital reporting should also be thought<br>of uh when it comes to sustainability<br>reporting um for our two years we do<br>have a sister board that develops<br>sustainability disclosure standards and<br>one difference between them and Us in<br>terms of how they go about standard<br>setting is that they have decided to go<br>digital from day<br>one obviously we have developed<br>standards for the past 50 years and the<br>majority um of that life actually was<br>paper based so we had to take a<br>conscious decision of moving over to<br>digital the Isis B said in today's world<br>everything is digital should be easy to<br>access so why do we uh why should we<br>actually develop the standards first and<br>paper based format and then think later<br>about a digital version so they have<br>made the decision that they would go<br>digital from day one there's strong<br>support uh internationally for their<br>standards development iosco the<br>international organization of Securities<br>commissions has recommended to member uh<br>jurisdictions to pick up the issb<br>standards but not only those but also<br>the<br>taxonomies and this is very important<br>because if you think about what I said<br>before investors want to have easy<br>access to financial information you<br>could say exactly the same thing about<br>sustainability information and if you<br>think about how sustainability reporting<br>links up and connects into financial<br>reporting it wouldn't make sense to<br>actually go digital only on<br>sustainability reporting but leaving<br>aite the financial reporting that's like<br>a three-legged horse doesn't make very<br>much<br>sense all right so I've already Ed the<br>buzzword<br>connectivity integration of financial<br>reporting with non-financial reporting<br>so this is a slide that the issb and the<br>if Foundation has used over the past<br>years to actually denote what our<br>mandate is at the if Foundation or at<br>the iasb and ISB<br>respectively the trustees have made a<br>very conscious decision they've said we<br>concentrate on users of financial<br>statements or user of General Financial<br>purpose reports and the users are those<br>that are charged with making investment<br>decisions that's not to say you can<br>disregard everybody else or just say<br>well they don't really matter um but you<br>have to concentrate on someone's needs<br>if you want to set standards if you just<br>include everyone and embrace everyone in<br>standard setting you probably get<br>nowhere so this was a quite conscious<br>decision and it was an easy decision for<br>the for the trustees because they said<br>why don't we pick the same user group<br>for the ISB that has served as well for<br>the ASB and if you believe and if you<br>agree with me that the iasb's history is<br>just but a success story because we are<br>the only private organization in the<br>world that has really set International<br>Global standards um then why should the<br>trustees depart from that role model so<br>it makes an awful lot of sense so our<br>work is denoted by that dark blue box<br>the traditional financial statements<br>what the issb our sister board is<br>developing sustainability related<br>Financial disclosures that are targeted<br>towards<br>investors but if you do have a broader<br>view as here for instance in New Zealand<br>if you think about your climate<br>disclosures if you think about the<br>impact on wider Society on nature and<br>things like that that's really for<br>others to decide upon either<br>jurisdictional Frameworks as here in New<br>Zeal newand or International Frameworks<br>and you could think about gri for<br>instance so we don't make them<br>Superfluous but we just take into<br>account they have their RIT we have our<br>RIT what we want to make sure is that<br>actually the boxes connect to each other<br>almost<br>frictionless they don't produce any gaps<br>and hopefully they don't produce any<br>overlap either or even<br>conflicts and then you see in the bottom<br>right hand<br>corner um two funny things like<br>integrated reporting and management<br>commentary that he could argue whether<br>that is actually part of financial<br>reporting or sustainability reporting is<br>probably borderline there so our mandate<br>at the iasb only deals with a dark blue<br>thing um yes we do have a project and uh<br>a pronouncement on management commentary<br>but as you will know um our<br>pronouncement only has the status of a<br>practice statement and not of a standard<br>and that was decided on purpose 15 years<br>ago because in many jurisdictions this<br>is security regulator space and we can't<br>really compete with them well that's<br>still holds true happy to take a<br>question later<br>on so what are the roles of the boards I<br>think I can go very quickly about this<br>uh you probably know this uh already so<br>the ISB develops the accounting<br>standards the issb develops the Su<br>sustainability disclosure standards um<br>we basically focus on financial position<br>and performance and deal with everything<br>that has happened up until the reporting<br>date what will happen tomorrow or after<br>the reporting date is for next year's<br>financial statements but not for this<br>year's financial statements this is<br>where the issb actually has a very<br>important role because it takes on from<br>where we leave obviously there are<br>sustainability disclosures that apply to<br>this year's period and probably also to<br>the past but more importantly there are<br>the entire information um that uh deal<br>with the future short medium and<br>long-term Outlook so um users have long<br>said it's all good that I'm being told<br>what has happened this year but I'm<br>really interested as to where the entity<br>is going what its strategy is what are<br>the risks and opportunities and we say<br>you won't find that in the financial<br>statements go look somewhere else you<br>may find them in management commentary<br>you may find them in a sustainability<br>report some you may find in a governance<br>report but be reminded that is not the<br>role of the financial<br>statements so the purpose is really for<br>our two boards to develop a cohesive<br>consistent set of requirements that<br>would give the user of the financial<br>statements a holistic view of a company<br>not just the past and the present but<br>also a future dealing with a strategy<br>risks and<br>opportunities what we are uh what we<br>have to make sure is actually um that<br>our statements talk to each other which<br>we call connectivity or<br>connectedness so um the ultimate game is<br>that the issb and the ISB produce<br>pronouncements that talk to each other<br>and enable companies to produce<br>information that talks to each other so<br>our ultimate game is really for<br>companies to be able to tell a holistic<br>picture that is internally consistent<br>that's using the same assumptions and<br>the same um understandings and<br>Concepts the ISB has made conscious<br>decisions in actually pulling some key<br>Concepts and principles from our<br>standards into their world if you think<br>about materiality if you think about the<br>role of these disclosures through rense<br>the reporting period they all take that<br>from our literature unchanged because<br>they believe that this would be the best<br>way to actually facilitate the<br>connectivity so we are internally we are<br>aiming at at having having connected<br>products and we ensure that by having<br>connected processes which is the thing<br>that you don't see because it's<br>happening under the hood this is just<br>day-to-day business so we talk to our<br>colleagues at the issb on a daily basis<br>I have regular catch-ups with the<br>leaderships uh of the other uh side our<br>staff talks on a daily basis the project<br>teams talk on a daily basis they inform<br>each other about touch points of their<br>work where it may impact the other board<br>to just highlight and say okay be<br>reminded this is tangential and we want<br>to make sure that actually we are not<br>producing any conflicts here and it<br>could go both ways so if they are going<br>into our territory we may reconsider<br>some of our pronouncements if we go into<br>their territory they might do the same<br>thing a perfect example of that is the<br>much beloved climate related other<br>uncertainties uh in the financial<br>statements project otherwise or<br>previously known as climate related<br>risks than the financial statements this<br>was a project that was highlighted to us<br>in the agenda consultation that the ISB<br>has to do every five years to just tap<br>the market and and see what stakeholders<br>really are interested in now that agenda<br>consultation Drew to a close before the<br>ISB was erected and that's important to<br>keep in mind um I think many people just<br>anticipated that this is the most likely<br>cause because obviously the trustee<br>consultation had already taken place<br>that was great support for that and<br>everybody was working towards that but<br>at the time that the con agenda<br>consultation closed there was no<br>ISB so when we then reviewed the<br>feedback we thought reading the comment<br>letters there were suggestions that<br>didn't stop at climate report climate<br>risks in the financial statements but<br>many stakeholders said could you please<br>develop a standard on climate risk<br>reporting and we said that's probably<br>better dealt with by the issb because<br>that's really their<br>territory which they have concentrated<br>on with<br>S2 but does that mean we can just say<br>job done thank you very much nothing<br>more for us we believe to my previous<br>point about connectivity we need to make<br>sure that the climate related<br>disclosures they are proposing in S2 are<br>actually linking up with the information<br>that's being housed in the financial<br>statements so we really take a narrow<br>focus on this project and say our<br>project is not about climate risk<br>reporting it's about climate risk<br>reporting in the financial<br>statements and it doesn't mean that we<br>just copy and paste everything that the<br>issb has produced on their side because<br>just to remind you there is a role for<br>the financial statements and there's a<br>role for something outside of the<br>financial statements and we don't<br>believe that by just merely copying<br>everything else that exists outside of<br>the financial statements has any benefit<br>to the uses of the financial<br>statements so to make it abundantly<br>clear in this project we won't be<br>developing a climate related standard<br>but we will take stock of what the ISB<br>has written in S2 and think about the<br>relationships and the touch points to<br>various areas in our literature now if I<br>say that there is no standard on climate<br>related risk and there will not be a<br>standard on climate related risk and the<br>financial statements<br>what am I then referring to as touch<br>points now I hope that you're all strong<br>Believers in principle-based accounting<br>standard setting and there is one<br>overarching standard is one the oldest<br>that we have well it's about to retire<br>but anyway um is one contains the<br>overarching concept that we use in<br>financial reporting the materiality<br>principle areas of significant judgment<br>and and<br>certainty I keep referring to I as one<br>as the least understood standard because<br>most companies that I'm aware of are<br>looking at that standard when they<br>transition to IFS and then they shelf<br>shelf it and never look at it again it's<br>really a Pity because I think it's a<br>pretty good<br>standard but if you think about the<br>materiality principle how do you apply<br>materiality to climate related risks my<br>answer my instant answer would be not<br>any different to how you assess<br>Financial risks or operational risk or<br>credit<br>risk a risk is a risk is a risk is a<br>risk the ISB is risk agnostic we don't<br>really care what the risk is we just say<br>if a risk has the potential of<br>materially affecting your financial<br>status you must consider it you can't<br>ignore<br>it that's what our literature<br>says where we silent is how you do that<br>but we don't tell tell you how you have<br>to do it in operational risk either so<br>what makes climate risk special why do<br>you want us to do something especially<br>exclus exclusively for just one risk and<br>I'm pretty sure as soon as we've dealt<br>with climate risk you would knock on my<br>door and said oh how about<br>biodiversity and how about human rights<br>and Labor<br>Relations beauty of principles based<br>standard setting don't blame me if you<br>think our literature has become too<br>complex then don't ask me for setting up<br>new rules right use your brain and don't<br>surrender it at the reception<br>disc so where are we going<br>next this is what I said at the outset<br>we do have a load of program so if you<br>want me to focus on something else tell<br>me which of these things go out of the<br>window<br>right so as part of the agenda<br>consultation we received suggestions for<br>70 new projects<br>70 I told you we have 20 projects and I<br>give you one further data point we have<br>about 30 technical staff that are<br>dealing with standard<br>setting<br>30 staff for 20 projects all right so no<br>way that we could take on another 70<br>forget about that so we had to funn that<br>down we first created a short list of<br>seven and we felt quite proud but then<br>we actually realize seven is still quite<br>a lot that will be an additional 25% to<br>our existing agenda so can we do that to<br>actually streamline it streamlined to<br>also send a very clear signal to the<br>outside market and to St holders because<br>if we are clear that we will not pick up<br>a particular project then you do not<br>need to worry about it you will not be<br>bothered with a discussion paper or an<br>exposure draft that we ask for your<br>comments you can just relax and<br>concentrate on those issues that we're<br>really dealing with so we made a<br>conscious decision to only deal with<br>three topics intangible assets because<br>arguably there's a huge gap in our<br>literature yes we do have a standard on<br>intangibles but it's 25 years old it was<br>developed in a completely different<br>environment and with a different purpose<br>in mind so the old standards have never<br>gone through what we nowadays call a<br>post implementation<br>review so we believe it's high time to<br>actually revisit this and look into is<br>the standard still working or are there<br>rope books that we should devote our<br>attention to and possibly make some<br>adjustments secondly statement of cash<br>flows now most people in this room will<br>probably say what's wrong with the<br>statement of cashow pretty old standard<br>i7 but by large is working probably okay<br>now if you ask the users they say this<br>is one of the most flaw statements that<br>we could think of and that's interesting<br>why well because it doesn't denote<br>non-cash<br>items is that hang on give me a pause<br>this is called the statement of cash<br>flows it's not called the statement of<br>non-cash flows right why would you<br>expect non-cash items to appear in the<br>statement of cash flows and then they<br>sign well I get that so we are not so<br>much looking at the statement per se<br>it's about changes that happen in the<br>working capital that you can't to pick<br>from the statement of cash flows and<br>that's creating a big worry because cash<br>is shifted from one jurisdiction from<br>one entity to the other and users can't<br>see<br>that um so this is just one example<br>another example obviously is the touch<br>points with the income statement that we<br>are about to change ifis 18 is coming<br>out in 3 months and um if we are<br>actually um changing the structure of<br>the income statement many people have<br>asked us to do a recap as to how that<br>relates to the cash flow statement um so<br>that's something that we will be<br>starting both projects will be started<br>uh in the first half of next year the<br>sorry the one project that we have<br>started already is climate related risk<br>and the financial statements as I said<br>but take into account What's um the the<br>headline uh above it it says maintenance<br>and consistent application it doesn't<br>say research pipeline projects and you<br>should keep that in mind this is a<br>narrow scope project that has a defined<br>Target it's not there to produce or<br>develop a climate rest standard and then<br>we do have a so-called Reserve list if<br>we find ourselves in the happy situation<br>that we are much faster and more<br>efficient in standard setting and<br>actually have spare resources before the<br>agenda cycle draws to a close then we<br>would draw our attention to one of these<br>remaining two operating segments of<br>mechanisms so what are we going to do<br>with intangibles and I'm not going to<br>run through all the projects I'm just uh<br>closing in on on inang and this will be<br>my last slide and then I'm happy to take<br>any questions that you may have so for<br>interchangeable items we've heard quite<br>a bit and I think the general concern is<br>that is38 is still based um on a company<br>that is a manufacturing company with R&amp;D<br>activities<br>but if you look out and look into the<br>the economy you would find the majority<br>of the GDP is actually earn in the<br>tertiary sector which is service<br>oriented<br>companies and obviously intangibles mean<br>quite a different thing for a service<br>oriented entity yes of course knowhow<br>patents um customer relationships exist<br>at manufacturing companies as<br>well but for service oriented companies<br>you can't see anything of that value<br>creation potential that otherwise would<br>be sitting on the left hand side of the<br>balance sheet well if you can't see the<br>potential you can't see the depletion<br>and consumption of that potential either<br>so it's not only that the balance sheet<br>is probably absolutely wrong is also<br>that the income statement is utterly<br>wrong the period periodization of the<br>expenses is wrong because you really<br>expense everything as incurred which<br>doesn't tell you<br>anything and then you you could say well<br>entities are free to give further<br>information in the notes how many<br>that thank you very much right so<br>obviously there is a need to increase<br>transparency in this very important<br>sector I should stress that the<br>objective is not to bring any thinkable<br>in changeable onto the balance sheet<br>because if I set that that would<br>frighten the horses probably of the<br>entire world economy people are saying<br>are you crazy this is not your job this<br>is the job of analysts and investors<br>your job is to give the information and<br>they make the<br>adjustments but we will see where we are<br>going so one of the first things that we<br>have to Define is the<br>problem what is the problem that we are<br>trying to fix and what ways are there to<br>fix that the one thing that I hope to be<br>promising to you is that this will not<br>become a strong Contender to I for 17<br>which took some 20 years to develop we<br>try to be a bit faster than that meaning<br>that we try to do it in chunks but you<br>have to be very very mindful if you do<br>that because you don't want to set<br>certain requirements in an early stage<br>that you then have to revoke or change<br>in a later stage again so you need to be<br>reasonably assured that what you develop<br>in the first stages actually stays on in<br>the subsequent periods all<br>right so my concluding slide I was asked<br>how I would change the way the IB<br>operates when I was two weeks in my<br>tenure and I used that<br>slide and I think when I Revisited that<br>I could still actually subscribe to all<br>the statements that I made on that<br>slide we are living in a fast changing<br>environment we want to stay relevant I<br>think financial reporting is relevant so<br>clearly the answer to the question is<br>there a future yes there is a future the<br>fact that you don't see us appear on the<br>headlines anymore and you only see<br>climate risk sustainability or over I<br>actually take with great pride because I<br>have lived in the space when actually<br>financial reporting was on the front<br>page and that was pretty ugly I can tell<br>you that was at the times when we had<br>the financial crisis and everybody<br>wanted us to change our requirements<br>rapidly right so sailing under the radar<br>is not a bad thing and especially if<br>users are telling you don't tin up with<br>financial reporting the system is<br>working it may not be pcture perfect but<br>it achieves what it was meant to achieve<br>if you have further information happy to<br>take it but don't Tinker with the system<br>so it is working keep that in<br>mind but there are challenges so one<br>program that I installed when I um<br>assumed office was the scanning The<br>Horizon program which is something that<br>you have never heard uh anywhere there's<br>not an official project in that time<br>that's an internal uh domain we have a<br>dedicated team that continuously surveys<br>uh the environment for macroeconomic and<br>micropolitical changes that may have an<br>impact on financial reporting why if<br>there is one thing that I would say<br>about the deficiency in financial<br>standard setting reporting standard<br>setting it is that we have a tendency to<br>deal with yesterday's<br>problems not with today's<br>problems and if you then take what I<br>said at the start that a good standard<br>takes about 8 to 10 years to develop you<br>come 8 to 10 years with a result after<br>the<br>fact so if you want to counter that you<br>actually need to become better in<br>forecasting so you need to peek ahead to<br>actually assume some of the things that<br>you're seeing on the horizon do some<br>upfront research to give you a head<br>start to actually set and go to shorten<br>that period down to a reasonable time so<br>that actually Your solution that you<br>produce arise when the issue is still<br>acute and hasn't gone<br>away with that I shall close thank you<br>very much for your attention and I'm<br>open for any questions that you may have<br>thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
