100% accurate.</p><p>the hereu was set up as as a it's not a<br>in the sense it's not dedicated to an<br>ancestor as such um but it was set up to<br>be a um an authentic teaching space um<br>for students teachers um who are<br>learning how to become teachers and also<br>growing in terms of um their knowledge<br>of and so a safe space in that sense<br>um where you can make your mistakes<br>gloriously um you know and and learn as<br>part of that<br>process yeah okay well I was a student<br>here in I started here in 1982 graduated<br>in<br>1984 so this F was opened in my second<br>year and so I was part of the crew that<br>opened this FY um you know being part of<br>getting it ready we built a um fak the<br>top there you know that was that was an<br>experience but it was our contribution<br>to the place<br>um we followed the T as laid down by to<br>Rankin Toby Curtis Ru and the<br>others at the<br>time um I was a k wi that day that we<br>opened it me and a couple of the other<br>guys<br>um and it was all part of this bigger<br>picture we did all our Strokes to make<br>this masterpiece and I think<br>can't get much better achievement than<br>that and knowing that it's going to<br>continue is you know we know we live in<br>a<br>legacy on the over this weekend of the<br>17th to the 19th of November uh we're<br>going to celebrate 40 Years of having<br>our and its current site and then on the<br>19th we're going to close the<br>so at um and then the carvings will be<br>removed um and the U panels um and some<br>of the smaller Tonga the photos the fahu<br>and things like that and um then there<br>will be a period of time where there'll<br>be some refurbishment there'll be some<br>new carvings that are made some new<br>panels that are made um and some yeah<br>sort of just refurbishing the ones that<br>need a little bit of um Jing up so we<br>shall we say um and then those will the<br>new marai F shell is being built um at<br>the city campus and so they will be the<br>carvings and the panels and the Tonga<br>will be replaced um into the new F<br>location and then we're looking forward<br>to hopefully having um an opening<br>celebration um and we're really looking<br>forward to that yeah um well<br>theu um celebrates its 40th uh birthday<br>if you like uh the 18th of November it<br>was opened on the 19th of November 40<br>years ago and was was the second F new<br>to be opened in a tertiary setting um<br>and so again we take the F with us and<br>um the FY will stand in the City Campus<br>there one<br>historical uh fact which is quite a<br>humorous to me is where it's going to be<br>sitting is kind of on the inside of um<br>the stone wall called the barracks wall<br>which sort of sits um just behind the<br>library there now the history of that<br>wall was<br>that was set up to um<br>stop uh the threat of a Mari Invasion<br>from U probably my tupuna from the north<br>um in the<br>1840s um the irony of History if you<br>like is that we're going to move to our<br>new site and we'll have this great<br>Barracks wall there which will be<br>protecting the F there so sort of<br>History sort of reversed itself in a in<br>a humorous sort of a way um so yeah but<br>anyway that's that's the the future<br>beckons in terms of the new site there<br>um close to way Papa and um the<br>opportunities there to to work together<br>and I'm not sure of any University<br>actually that in Alo that has uh two Mar<br>on located on the one campus um so I<br>think that's a a sign of leadership in<br>terms of the tery sector there one<br>advantage is that with is going is in<br>the um is in the building it's part of a<br>you know two-story building and all the<br>staff are going into that building as<br>well so at the moment it's this is sort<br>of on a periphery and people can walk<br>past without<br>actually um going in or whatever but<br>when it's in the same building you know<br>you might as well go down and have a cup<br>of tea in the in the kitchen down there<br>you're going to be walking through it to<br>get to your office or whatever so it<br>could possibly draw people even closer<br>to it um students will be using that<br>building for classes so the B right<br>there they could become one of the<br>classroom so it might well probably will<br>be be used more often I think but time<br>will tell time will tell it was really<br>good that um white Papa and atie Fu<br>agreed to this F going over there I used<br>to tell them that we were the T cuz this<br>was open first but now that we're going<br>over there the roles are reversed<br>so we're now the<br>T it's like um back home in The Valleys<br>in the far you have more than one marai<br>in the<br>F you some got half a dozen or more um<br>so you know it's that sort of<br>relationship it's another within the E<br>of<br>Pap and so the fny will kind of sleep<br>for a period of time for about 6 Seven 8<br>months maybe and we looking to reopen<br>the<br>f um in the middle of next year at um<br>Miki and so that'll be symbolic um in<br>itself um the process though in terms of<br>uh moving from here to there is will be<br>about um taking down all the carvings<br>and tuu tuku and all of those things and<br>we have a uh Master Cara Cuts myi who's<br>going to oversee that um the standing<br>around here is that it's possibly only<br>the carvings and the T that are holding<br>the actual building together um because<br>the building wasn't designed to last as<br>long as it has it was a prefab and um<br>has a a lifespan if you like so<br>um once that's all done um there'll be<br>some restorative work that's done to the<br>carvings uh tuku tuku and and other<br>little bits and pieces and um in<br>preparation for rehanging the all of<br>these things that you see here uh inside<br>the new space uh the new space is the<br>the same uh width as this F uh but'll be<br>a we bit longer so I'll offer some other<br>opportunities in terms of um fako and<br>tuku and so on and so forth farik and<br>stuff um so we're working that out as we<br>go uh but that's kind of the the process<br>to and thereafter uh time for um moving<br>all the tong of their inside here over<br>into this new uh building on the City<br>Campus well being born in the city uh<br>although you know I know where I'm from<br>I know where my m is I've been there um<br>you don't have<br>that daily attachment to it or you know<br>every weekend you go to the m or you go<br>to who for the mar so when we were here<br>and this place was being built we were<br>part of the process of um building this<br>place and so it came out Deo Mar for a<br>lot of us cuz you know there others that<br>didn't know where they were from so this<br>was their Mar I should say this was Al<br>marai um so you know it's very halted<br>very very closely to us and very close<br>to us um we considered El Mar even<br>though it's you know it's part of the<br>University now but uh we were here on<br>the 19th of November when it was open<br>happened you know like helping put<br>putting the carvings up um a lot of the<br>students my fellow students did the TU<br>tuu uh the Cori up here was painted by<br>students by our our<br>cohorts<br>um a couple of the carvings were done by<br>students uh we have one Poe in the<br>corner there that is done by ex students<br>who who had left before this place was<br>so and of course we we did the Mah<br>around here<br>um yeah so<br>very clear deep feelings for the place<br>part of the original cohort the students<br>who<br>um created the you know did the carving<br>and created some of the panels in there<br>um there are fari and tapa that<br>represent the different M um<br>around and different pieces have been<br>gifted um from different communities um<br>and so you know there really is a place<br>for everybody in that F you know there<br>is um you know we have a Paro in there<br>that was um carved by one of the<br>students um and different<br>representations of different cultures um<br>from around the world so it really is a<br>space where everyone can find their<br>connection um and I think that's really<br>important you know I think it's really<br>important you know we know that our pako<br>you know a lot of them were brought here<br>by our ancestors from throughout the<br>Pacific you know and there those<br>connections are really really strong so<br>I think it's really um important you<br>know that um we're able to ensure that<br>those pako are continued in the city<br>site as well and we're very fortunate to<br>be supported um by Pacifica staff and ex<br>students um and community ities who are<br>part of the process um and making sure<br>that those P continue along with the p<br>of tonu in its new site largely the name<br>will change because we'll be moving to a<br>new space which is kind of in the heart<br>of NTI fatua and so um we've begun some<br>discussion with uh with Michael um<br>steedman and Naji fatua uh about an<br>appropriate name um I've certainly got<br>some ideas to I wanted to throw the thr<br>to to the mix there um where we might<br>find a position where we can<br>um retain a little bit of what we have<br>here but there the discussion still to<br>be had um but as I said primarily<br>because we're moving into the heart of<br>natif Fatu of the kind of have to do the<br>the right thing in terms of um talking<br>with naatu about an appropriate um name<br>I think you know it's going to be<br>difficult for some who have been here<br>you know through all of the various<br>chapters of this campus um maybe not all<br>of them it has been here for 100 years<br>but you know there have been people<br>who've been here for more chapters than<br>me I will say um and so it's always hard<br>to say goodbye particularly such a<br>beautiful um space a beautiful place you<br>know nestled underneath our MOA um and<br>you know with our beautiful puawa and<br>things like that um but I think also you<br>know there are some real opportunities<br>for us in the city<br>particularly you know being closer to<br>some of our um kimar that we love to<br>collaborate with and work with um and<br>sometimes you know you do feel like you<br>can be a little bit far away from the<br>action over here um and a little bit<br>separate so really really looking<br>forward to um being located within that<br>you know that huge kind of and really<br>inspirational kah of kahi Mali um at the<br>City Campus um and building a stronger<br>relationship and connection with white<br>Papa marai as well alongside our marai<br>having two marai on the City Campus I<br>think that's going to be really amazing<br>so yeah I think there's there's a<br>mixture of sadness but there's also some<br>excitement I will say on the one hand a<br>little bit of sort of sadness about<br>leaving this space it's a beautiful<br>space um we've been located here for the<br>last 100 years or so uh in terms of<br>teacher<br>education um<br>and on the other hand there's the the<br>opportunity in terms of um turning a<br>page and<br>um moving into a new environment and the<br>challenges that are part of that but<br>also the opportunities there so um yeah<br>kind of a little bit um ambivalent at<br>the moment but at the end of the day um<br>we're all committed to um to this part<br>of the journey and um the new future<br>Campus</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
