there's two Cambodian<br>people that want to come people that<br>want to<br>come who knows when come<br>so let me<br>start um just with a brief introduction<br>of John marsten I've known him for a<br>long time since<br>1996 and he was my teacher at C<br>and I don't feel like I'm a very good<br>advertisement because he taught me c at<br>CI and my C<br>is no a definite success<br>story but just let me let me but um so<br>he is and people say where are you from<br>and he was born in the United States um<br>but he's been uh his most of his<br>professional life has been in Mexico so<br>he's actually from Mexico so that's<br>confusing and then he works uh on on<br>Cambodia so he spends a lot of time in<br>Cambodia um so we have a transnational<br>person here um so he completed a<br>doctorate in anthropology at the<br>University of Washington in<br>1997 and he's published three edited<br>volumes on Cambodia and the anthropology<br>of Southeast Asia um one with me um and<br>a couple of others on his his own and um<br>as well as numerous articles and books<br>and scholarly journals and a lot of his<br>uh work has been published in Spanish so<br>he has an extensive Catal catalog of uh<br>Works in Spanish at published by the Kia<br>de Mexico um<br>so um he just we're lucky to have him<br>here I snagged him up um I knew that he<br>was going to India and I said why don't<br>you detour from India uh to New Zealand<br>on your way back to Cambodia so it just<br>sort of got that little fragment of time<br>where he was free to come to New Zealand<br>and I feel very lucky um he's never been<br>to New Zealand and I've been um<br>introducing him to blue skin Bay in the<br>SES around wedy and I think you've<br>enjoyed it so far definitely and we're<br>he's gonna have another week here before<br>heading back to um bit more than a week<br>before heading back to Cambodia so um<br>that's that's it from me um and I'll<br>turn it over to you<br>now okay well thank you very much and I<br>feel very honored to be in this<br>distinguished series um after in where<br>quite a few of very distinguished<br>Scholars of Buddhism have have spoken in<br>previous years um and my thanks so much<br>for the invitation to come here and um<br>so I thought I'd start out by talking<br>about about my work and um and and the<br>fact that this is a course in readings<br>in Buddhist text which has always made<br>me a little bit nervous and so<br>um um what does it mean to be talking<br>about text for for someone like me uh<br>and I as as AA said my training is as an<br>anthropologist and Anthropologist may<br>have a different idea about text than<br>buddists and um I always generally when<br>I meet Scholars of other Scholars of<br>Buddhism I say well I'm not a textural<br>scholar at the same time uh I do use<br>texts and the five talks I'm going to<br>give here all each of them has at least<br>one heat text and so on the other hand<br>keep in mind that as an anthropologist<br>um we have a different idea of text that<br>text we can do textual analysis<br>on um on spatial relations and<br>performance um we can do textual analys<br>on discourse in a larger sense of the<br>word um so what I work on is not<br>canonical texts uh and yet I use text I<br>I was asking myself our interviews count<br>as text well<br>uh interviews could count as texts if<br>you analyze them as texts although<br>mostly I I do a lot of interview work<br>and perhaps I don't analyze my<br>interviews as text and yet ultimately<br>there are questions of text even in the<br>process of of doing interviews um<br>um<br>uh um the it'll be my talk tomorrow<br>about uh a Sema text which is the<br>closest to what budologist generally<br>would consider a a textual study and<br>this is of course the one that I'm most<br>nervous about and we'll see how that<br>goes tomorrow um but and my way of<br>dealing with that will be to talk<br>about my process of dealing with this<br>text and and how complex that could be<br>um I as I said I'm I'm not concerned so<br>much with canonical text I in my work<br>I've been very much concerned with with<br>things that are peripheral this may be<br>an anthropological perspective and it<br>may be my personal personal perspective<br>um in the article that I gave you to<br>read for about the my talk today will be<br>about a Cambodian monk dharmar mahat<br>Tera who was however much of his life<br>was not in Cambodia it was in India and<br>later on in the United States and in<br>Europe and uh I and by the way I'm my<br>undergraduate training was in English<br>literature and<br>so and I'm definitely not a scholar of<br>literature now but I occasionally try to<br>make little references um and at the end<br>of the at the end of the article I say<br>daravar was not Prince Hamlet um and<br>this is um uh this is my sort of inner<br>joke which I don't expect many people to<br>get it's a reference to a poem bys<br>Elliot um called the Love Song of J<br>Alfred proof rocket which says no I'm<br>not Prince Hamlet no was meant meant to<br>be am an attendant uh and one that will<br>do to just well a progress star a scene<br>or two um and what I know and which I<br>don't expect you to know is that when I<br>was in high school there was a play um<br>called Rosen CR and Gilden Stern are<br>dead and um Rosen CR and Gilden turn<br>were were courtiers in the play of<br>Hamlet by Shakespeare and um they're<br>minor characters uh who just sort of um<br>but this play that came out in the 1960s<br>which was considered important at that<br>time uh took the play of Hamlet and<br>shift the focus to be a play about these<br>two minor characters Rosen counts and<br>Gilder and so in some ways what I like<br>to do is to shift the focus from the<br>main character to more peripheral<br>character<br>um and so some of the people I look like<br>look at like the figure of Dharma<br>Maha we can say was he Central to<br>Cambodian Buddhism Indian Buddhism the<br>Buddhist of his time and I might<br>say well the more you work on them the<br>more Central they begin to seem but also<br>I think that somehow if we shift our<br>Focus that sometimes we can see the<br>texture of the time the texture of the<br>whole social event and the whole<br>historical event and so when you think<br>about what I'm trying to do here that's<br>part of what I'm trying to do um three<br>of<br>my the papers I'm going to give are on<br>work<br>on uh Cambodian monks Cambodian Buddhism<br>is it links to connects to India and and<br>to much lesser degree Sri Lanka<br>and um I I will began doing this at a<br>certain point<br>because uh there was a lot of interest<br>in<br>transnationalism<br>and um and this idea among Academia that<br>um instead of looking at the center<br>instead of looking at what was happening<br>in plumen uh what happens if you look at<br>the periphery and so um and so if you<br>began to look at what was happening on<br>the borders of Cambodia or people were<br>Crossing Borders then then you might<br>find interesting things that you might<br>you might see things in a different way<br>than if you were just focusing on border<br>and so that has been an idea that's<br>informed by<br>work and um so I'm I'm<br>not so we can say that for texts as well<br>so um I was going to mention uh this is<br>that one of the texts that I signed uh<br>which would may you might have had time<br>to read it's a text by it's a it's a I<br>think it was really a speech or was an<br>article written by nordom nanuk<br>was uh a prince he was a king for a<br>while he abdicated and then um but he<br>became he remained an important<br>political fer he was head of state of<br>Cambodia and he wrote an article about<br>um Buddhist socialism Cambodia and which<br>as you'll see I I use in the talk I'm<br>going to give today um actually I was in<br>communication with a with one of the<br>major historians of Cambodia was name is<br>David Chandler and Chandler wrote me and<br>said but really<br>that that article that essay by COK on<br>Buddha socialism is not important at all<br>and um so of course this is a<br>disagreement but part of the argument I<br>would make is this is a minor talk this<br>is a minor essay and yet a minor essay<br>if we look at it the right way if we put<br>it in the social context of its time it<br>begins to tell us things that we might<br>not know<br>otherwise and that's sort of what I'm<br>trying to do here with Texs um now I'm<br>I'm<br>I'm not hoping my goal here is to not<br>Define Buddhist true as again I'm not<br>looking at canonical texts people who<br>are interested in a profounder<br>understanding of<br>Buddhism well that's probably what I<br>won't give you but I'm hoping<br>that by my work we can look at a better<br>sense of the social context and the<br>historical context especially look at<br>moments of historical change or<br>transition and sort of see the not just<br>what was happening at the highest level<br>but a sense of<br>the to some extent of the social fabric<br>the relation of Buddhism to Society at a<br>point of<br>change uh so um uh okay so my today is<br>about Dharma mahat Pera he was a<br>Cambodian monk um I have<br>uh I've given presentations about him<br>before uh and uh sometimes I focus more<br>on his biography and the article which<br>you were you may have read is focused<br>specifically on uh a certain time period<br>it gives a theoretical focus on Cold War<br>Theory um and so I will be combining<br>these two approaches so I'll be talking<br>a lot just about his life which<br>personally I found quite interesting in<br>and of itself but there are other<br>questions about how this relates to<br>um uh how this relates to the<br>relationship of<br>Buddhism uh to to a certain time and<br>place uh which<br>which in the article I try to relate to<br>Cold War<br>um<br>okay let's<br>see um so anyway so this is again a<br>Cambodian monk but a a monk who must of<br>his career was actually outside of<br>Cambodia<br>um while significant gaps in ambiguities<br>underline much of what we know about<br>dharmar basic narrative emerges dharmara<br>was born ukong was born in the late 19th<br>century the family with connections to<br>the court and French authorities he was<br>in one of the first cohorts of the<br>Cambodian School of colonial<br>Administration and completed exams the<br>intercolonial service in<br>1918 belong held a variety of provincial<br>administrative posts in the colonial<br>bureaucracy from January<br>1919 from clerk to training judge to for<br>judge in K District K in the PowerPoint<br>you see I I I just was overjoyed when I<br>found this picture in the National<br>Archives um of him uh an ID of him uh<br>when he during this period when he<br>worked for the colonial bureaucracy uh<br>you uh there's various stories about him<br>some people<br>have PE people connected say there used<br>to be a picture of him from this period<br>dressed in Colonial whites you know and<br>the many people thought that that<br>picture was taken in France although<br>actually I believe he never actually did<br>go to France um uh this um he although<br>it's not mentioned in the article I<br>wrote uh um he had trouble from<br>beginning I mean he was a troublemaker<br>uh every all all the indications his<br>family members the stories in his family<br>because he was he he had he was a heavy<br>drinker heavy gambler um one theory is<br>that he may have been involved in other<br>addictive substances um uh this is a<br>quotation from one of the an earlier<br>time uh when he undergo underwent<br>disciplinary measures when he and a<br>group of other civil servants were<br>discovered gambling in I believe that<br>was he was still in Kon Province at that<br>time and and and the report says the<br>existence of such morals and elements<br>which should be the lead of the<br>indigenous population is painful to note<br>nights of drinking and gambling by<br>officials as well as indigenous notables<br>responsible for the collection of taxes<br>are of such a nature as to disturb the<br>already weak spirits of the population I<br>believe it is appropriate to put a break<br>on dangerous tendencies that have<br>extended to such a degree offenders are<br>formally ordered not to repeat this<br>um<br>um uh<br>um he he<br>his his work shifted but he continued to<br>rise in the colonial bureaucracy um uh<br>eventually achieving the post of balot<br>stro which at the time at assistant<br>District Governor in banti mot in March<br>25th a few months later in July he was<br>made District Chief in pror District<br>Kabam and served there for a year and a<br>half before being removed from office he<br>was married in 1921 one uh i' just been<br>told by someone uh who I met in India<br>that he he eloped with his wife without<br>the permission of her parents um so uh<br>he had recently had a child when the<br>crisis developed that would cause him to<br>leave Cambodia his work was suspended in<br>December 23rd 1926 when he was arrested<br>for financial<br>irregularities escaped the kcham<br>provincial prison on February 13th<br>1927 when he was tried In Absentia the<br>following July he was found guilty of<br>having diverted public money in the sum<br>of<br>9,344 36 pias for his personal use as<br>well as having asked for money from<br>subordinate administrators in the sum of<br>of 46.8 81 and<br>13565 piasters he was sentenced to 65<br>years of hard labor by the time the<br>trial took place he muw well have<br>already ordained as a forest Monk and<br>gone to laosa from there to S well we<br>this we know very little about this we<br>this is from the National Archives of<br>Cambodia uh uh you could in try to<br>interpret this what was happening in<br>colonial uh Cambodia at that time uh his<br>family believed that um it was a trap<br>that he was he was actually in some ways<br>involved in the resistance French and so<br>this was actually he was actually<br>innocent of the charges or um there<br>might be other ways of exp explaining<br>this but what we what we know is that uh<br>he was in prison and he escaped from<br>prison and and he made the decision to<br>become a monk at this time uh which<br>perhaps was originally just a way of<br>lying low and although he he would<br>eventually have a great calling as a<br>monk and um<br>his his ordination was genuine he he was<br>genuinely a monk uh um so<br>from there he left apparently went to LA<br>there he went to sayam and then he went<br>to Burma before eventually arriving in<br>India<br>um uh again here are some quotations uh<br>and although this is we have very little<br>information about this what we have is<br>what seemed to been an autobiographical<br>essay probably written with the help of<br>other people uh it was near the end of<br>his life which would say and he lived to<br>be over a hundred years old and so how<br>accurate this is we don't know and yet<br>it seems to be there may be some minor<br>errors and yet it seems to be generally<br>consistent with um with other things we<br>know about him other things we know<br>about what was happening in the time<br>period um so just to read these uh this<br>is from a short Meo Memoir of him he<br>first went to LA and then crossed over<br>to uban Raj rajastani Thailand during<br>the the Reigns of King Rama I 6 and 7th<br>where he was ordained a second time it<br>was here that he was introduced a high<br>ranking Buddhist monk a living sa known<br>as chukun P gam macharia who had the<br>Mastery of Buddhism both in gandur and<br>Pati<br>orur<br>andadura now I'm sorry if I'm<br>pronouncing those wrong um he was<br>believed to be a living arand who was<br>highly respected by one and all from the<br>man in the street to the princess and<br>Kings well I've tried to talk to high<br>Scholars about this figure upali and<br>upali was an important Monk and exactly<br>how this fits into what we know about<br>upali uh what we know about daravar is<br>there are questions uh the main thing<br>keep in mind is this there there's no<br>claims that he was studying with uh a<br>Chan mon uh was the most famous Forest<br>monk of his time and yet he was doing<br>doing apparently Forest meditation at<br>the time of when very important Forest<br>meditation was taking place in Thailand<br>and this is something to discuss with<br>Scholars who know more about about the<br>Thai Forest tradition but it it's<br>significant he was there in the 1930s<br>and he claimed to have both training uh<br>in Forest the forest tradition he also<br>studied uh level three in the exams at<br>this time which is um unusual<br>um<br>uh then uh okay yes here it goes on<br>under this guidance he not only learned<br>to practice meditation and concentration<br>of mind to live a life of solitude and<br>the force but also the hard life of<br>rigid disciplines of aeis deprived of<br>all ease and comfort he studied with his<br>teacher in the forest boarding the<br>frontiers of Thailand and Cambodia in<br>the territories of jwat Surin and kukan<br>for about years as a result of Buddhist<br>studies he earned three degrees one of<br>which is equivalent to the doctrine of<br>divinity and<br>Christianity that may be an exaggeration<br>he then went to Bangkok and Burma where<br>he was given ordination for the third<br>time and learned to practice meditation<br>under the direct guidance of a living<br>saint named most venerable subata mahat<br>mahashi shy of rangun he also learned<br>another method is taught by the most<br>venerable n Sayad who was also respected<br>as as a saint now again there are small<br>he here and and yet the evidence and<br>part of the evidence is that he had<br>these linguistic skills he definitely<br>had uh an impressive command of Thailand<br>which which he used throughout the rest<br>of his life um and but we know that he<br>was in both Siam which was not yet<br>called Thailand and and then went from<br>there to Burma uh perhaps for a shorter<br>time and he also knew burmes although we<br>have there's less evidence of the level<br>of his his bermes<br>language<br>um<br>um this to me is a a fascinating thing<br>um and I again I'm I'm building my<br>evidence on on very slim uh slim<br>documentary evidence um but there was in<br>this time in the 1930s uh there was a<br>fascinating um<br>Italian-American monk named lanata um<br>and uh I<br>um now<br>I'm<br>uh um see wonder what I have in my notes<br>and what I just remember um uh I seem to<br>have<br>uh<br>um lost my pages here<br>but but anyway um lanata was um again<br>one of these fascinating figures who<br>only recently has been work about him uh<br>he he he was born in Brooklyn uh to an<br>Italian family um at a certain point I<br>think he worked in his accountant um at<br>a certain point he had a fascination<br>with he began to go to to India he spent<br>time in India later he spent significant<br>time in in in Burma um at a certain<br>point in 19 the 1930s he began to<br>organize pilgrimages which brought monks<br>from Sri<br>Lanka uh Sri Lanka sayam<br>uh uh and Burma to India some of them<br>were traveling by foot<br>and we don't really have a clear<br>evidence that daravar was part of these<br>groups but we have a small document by<br>dhar's grandson um which I I I reproduce<br>here um and it seems to be a Bic<br>document from Colonial Burma which makes<br>reference to uh uh that Cambodia care of<br>loan SES Buddhist Expo camp and Thon uh<br>and this could mean various things<br>either he that he was with a group of<br>Thai monks traveling with lanata or that<br>he was already in Burma and somehow was<br>connected with with this group of burmes<br>monks going to going to India what we<br>know is that this is about the time that<br>he went to India and um whether he<br>really went with these monks or with<br>other people we don't know but this was<br>happening at the same time<br>and the end result was that he went to<br>to India and um and claims in one<br>document who arrived in<br>1934<br>um in 19 a 1987 speech referring to his<br>1934 arrival in India daravar<br>stated although my purpose in coming to<br>India was to study English poly Hindi<br>Sanskrit and particularly the teachings<br>of love and compassion for one and all<br>without discrimination as preached by<br>the<br>Buddha Gandhi G's nonviolent methods<br>created such an irresistible interest in<br>my mind that I felt impelled to visit<br>his Asam in Ahmed Abad and Ward and Ward<br>I stayed with him for a few months<br>um<br>um part of the<br>standard narrative surrounding dharmar<br>is that while he was wandering around<br>India after struggling with his own<br>health at a time of extreme disability<br>when he lost his memory and the ability<br>to walk he suddenly discovered he had a<br>gift for healing he subsequently<br>consequently began to be sought out as a<br>Healer um and here's<br>some um some passages again from one of<br>these<br>um<br>Memoir short Memoirs that were written<br>near the end of his life he said at<br>first I learned about healing in order<br>to help myself after I was cured I<br>learned how to heal others anyone can be<br>a Healer but of course there are some<br>who are gifted the special healing power<br>the laying on of hands I myself have<br>this gift but it took me years to<br>discover it when I was in India a man<br>with a very sad face came to me and<br>asked me to go and see his ailing wife<br>I'd read in a book that some people had<br>this healing power in the hands so I<br>thought I might as well try since there<br>was nothing else I could do she had a<br>cancer of the abdomen and I asked her<br>husband if I could touch her he saides<br>by all means I was thinking that even if<br>she died under my hands they couldn't<br>blame me mere touch can't kill anybody<br>so I laid my hands on her and prayed in<br>my mind to the Buddha to help me the<br>moment I put my hands on her it had a<br>soothing effect she went to sleep at<br>once after 3 hours the husband came he<br>told me that when she woke up it was<br>just as if she never been sick she said<br>that she did not know anything after I<br>put my hands on her was like she had<br>taken a sleeping pill the pain also had<br>gone and when she woke up she did not<br>feel that she had anything wrong with<br>her you can imagine my happiness to know<br>that I could heal like that it was a<br>great thing to me so it was from that<br>day that I came to know that I had this<br>power this was the beginning how I came<br>to heal that's the reason I touch people<br>so you have this complex person that um<br>throughout his life<br>uh uh had um was involved in in healing<br>practices later on he'd be associated<br>with healing uh with colored light and<br>colored um and water that had been<br>exposed uh through uh through colored<br>glass to um uh and and so you have this<br>figure who on one hand<br>is uh had pretentions to uh scholarly<br>knowledge of poly um on the other hand<br>he was a Healer and we have a figure who<br>eventually would come to to associate<br>with uh political figures um so we have<br>someone who is Buddhist and and yet<br>um<br>um in<br>his 1987 talk he mentioned staying for<br>several years in La hor in what is now<br>Pakistan with d Raj son an Oxford<br>educated barister at law who had been a<br>Justice in chamu and Kashmir since<br>1928 in 1938 son introduced daravar to<br>prominent couple Bridge L neru and his<br>wife rameswari neru uh rameswari was a<br>social activist closely involved with<br>Mahatma Gandhi and his movement her<br>husband was jaah haral Nero's first<br>cousin a few years older than jaah haral<br>bridg La was studying at Oxford um and<br>was close to finishing his studies when<br>javah haral went to herrow in<br>1905<br>um<br>um um he was still in England preparing<br>for the Colonial service exam when jaah<br>Harel entered Cambridge and returning to<br>India bridg La assumed high ranking<br>positions in the colonial government he<br>was quote a s this is from what<br>dharmara wrote he was quote a Sanskrit<br>scholar a yogi and a staunch believer in<br>natural<br>healing and I quote uh the 1987 par<br>Pandit Bridge Alo was particularly<br>interested in my natural healing works<br>and I in his therefore there was no<br>difficulty for us to come together and<br>share with one another what we have<br>learned to make life grow richer<br>healthier and wiser they bridg LA and<br>rameswar Nero became my greatest Ben<br>benefactors in no<br>time in his 1987 talk davar recounted<br>how rameswari worked directly with<br>Gandhi and discussed her advocacy for<br>the rights of women and members of lower<br>cast<br>um biographical writing about rameswari<br>also discuss her activism on behalf of<br>women in lower cast as well as her work<br>for refugees at the time of partition<br>and later in her life involvement in<br>World Peace movements she led protests<br>as early as the 1930s and was briefly<br>imprisoned twice in 1942 following<br>demonstrations these biographical<br>sources make no mention of dharmara but<br>the accounts are consistent with his<br>1987 talk and the description of Shari's<br>role in the creation of the sh given by<br>its current<br>abot um uh to a degree the intellectual<br>currents rameswari was engaged with<br>naturopathy the rights of lower cast<br>population World Peace were those that<br>dharmar pursued from a more Buddhist<br>perspective um uh and there are<br>references although I don't I think I<br>cut it of my article for reasons of<br>space that um that rameswari husband was<br>in interested in<br>naturopathy and and yoga and which is<br>consistent with what we<br>know um The Narrative dharmar life is<br>told by his followers often states that<br>his connection to the narrow family was<br>a result of his success in<br>healing jaah haral Nero's Uncle<br>according to the story is told to me by<br>dharmar successor at the show commission<br>the person cured was bridel Nero himself<br>um overall picture ofok is intriguing<br>and suggests something of the social<br>possibilities in the era a Wandering<br>Buddhist monk taken to the household of<br>an elite Hindu judge convinced of his<br>healing capacities and living there for<br>several years then taken up by a<br>prominent couple likewise intellectual<br>Hindu Elites of some<br>influence indebted to him for healing<br>and devoted to the possibilities of<br>naturopathic health<br>practices during this period according<br>to the 1987<br>talk d arara set up a health center in<br>laor uh a friend in goodan Wala placed<br>one of his buildings at my disposal I<br>use it as a health home where all kinds<br>of patients came to seek health and<br>well-being and because hundreds of them<br>returned home cured the number of<br>patients increased<br>manyfold like Dava Raj Bridal was an<br>official in jamu Kashmir their count<br>General the kmir connections of these<br>two men may relate to a plan referred to<br>in a couple of sources to include<br>dharmar and a naturopathic health center<br>project and the hill stations of cashmir<br>in the post Independence period this was<br>to be headed by a Belarusian woman who<br>assumed the name Indra Davian would<br>herself achieve<br>Renown dhabar was to teach meditation<br>and deie would<br>claim in the 195 50s that the project<br>had been approved by jawahar onu uh the<br>project came to nothing perhaps due to<br>developments in the wake of Independence<br>in including increasing unrest in<br>Kashmir and Indra Davy went instead to<br>the United States as a Pioneer teacher<br>of<br>yoga as one of his followers tells the<br>story daravar said metaphorically that<br>he meditated under a tree in Kashmir and<br>at the time of partition the tree that<br>gave him shelter was divided into two<br>we know in any case that his patterns<br>were Hindu intellectuals and that like<br>many Hindus and siks from all walks of<br>life he made the move to Delhi at some<br>point during this chaotic time rameswari<br>and Bridal narum remained in lore and<br>worked with refugees for as long as they<br>could it was only a few months after<br>they came to Delhi that rameswari came<br>up with a plan to help dharmar establish<br>a center in merali on the outskirts of<br>the city the land not far from the<br>archaeological side of kup Minar justs<br>off from the main road into what is now<br>the compound of the archaeological side<br>um here's just a a picture of davar from<br>1942 and I don't know where this is<br>taken and I don't know it says 1942 so<br>uh I I think at this time he was<br>primarily based in laor but this was<br>when perhaps already he was<br>uh he he he had links to to to New Delhi<br>where he would move following the<br>partition<br>um<br>um according to AOK missions current<br>Abbot the site had been used to house<br>Muslim refugees but was then left vacant<br>when following petition the refugees<br>moved to<br>Pakistan the land was thus under the<br>administration of The Rehabilitation<br>Ministry and rameswari worked there<br>without compensation as a head of<br>women's issues isues after arriving in<br>Delhi no doubt rameswari and bridg law<br>conceived of it as operating along the<br>lines of the center davara had directed<br>in Gan<br>Wala merali was still considered remote<br>from the city and the land not<br>particularly valuable it was deeded to<br>darhar for a nominal<br>fee called the aoka mission or the shoka<br>vihara by the 1950s the center was<br>probably functioning much in the way it<br>did during the rest of the period<br>daravar was in<br>charge um and well not in this picture<br>these probably are<br>from uh later period there's a logo on<br>the left um uh the point of this logo<br>which we might note that it was it was<br>aoka Health Center you know it it was<br>always uh in some sense a Buddhist<br>temple but it also had a health purpose<br>and many of the people people<br>surrounding uh from the surrounding<br>Community came there for health purposes<br>rather than rather than religious<br>purposes eventually it became in the 60s<br>it became a a hosle a youth hosel um uh<br>and and international travels would<br>would stay there um uh including western<br>western hippies uh in on the hippie<br>Trail um um this is also a later picture<br>on the right from perhaps the late 60s<br>or 1970s There's a western uh a British<br>man who ordained at that time but uh<br>note the flowers not the sign that says<br>a shoko there um here's are some<br>pictures uh which I took at the show<br>commission and it gives you a feeling of<br>the and this is of course at the present<br>time there's these old the the picture<br>on uh on the top is most interesting to<br>me one of the most interesting in that<br>this the wall surrounding this area was<br>a mugal wall um so and this is in the<br>area of cup Minar which is an important<br>archaeological site a tourist site of<br>from the mugal period and um the wall is<br>an ancient wall around it there a well<br>there which is also an ancient well<br>dating to the mugal period uh the<br>building the lower building is<br>supposedly a mugal building it's hard to<br>imagine exactly but um but then it began<br>it was built up as his own Temple and<br>um the mission eak out of modest<br>subsistence from rent paid by villagers<br>working part of the land and from a YMCA<br>youth hostel established in<br>1952 some distance from the vihara<br>proper the shok mission was a<br>naturopathic health center<br>and dharmar was sought after as a Healer<br>by Indians regardless of religious<br>affiliation a logo from the 1950s<br>suggests um the logo might actually be<br>from the 1960s that was marketed as Yoga<br>Center a Dharma wheel floats above a<br>lotus<br>flower in a bucolic scene of a lake<br>surrounded by mountains with deer and<br>tiger grazing peacefully on one side and<br>the silhouette of a figure in a yoga<br>pose on the other at the same time it<br>was a Buddhist temple and a point of<br>reference from Buddhist<br>um an important element of the standard<br>narrative surrounding Dharma verus his<br>connection with jawahar Nero we should<br>be careful about drawing any conclusions<br>he was never such an important part of<br>Nero's Circle that he would be for<br>example mentioned in a biography because<br>of the strong connection to bridge L and<br>Rishi narrow however he had X as the<br>family the narrow family as a whole<br>um<br>um um dhar's connection to n is rather<br>different from his connection to<br>Ceno who is at this point still king of<br>Cambodia Which is less often mentioned<br>but better documented the most<br>convincing evidence of dhar's connection<br>in there is that cater seemed to use<br>daravar as a way of linki<br>daero among documents held by memories<br>of dhar's family are brief<br>notes from indir gandi from the 1970s<br>for our purpose of the degree to which<br>daravar was connected to n is not so<br>important as the fact that he had links<br>to the higher echelons of the Indian<br>government and sufficient understanding<br>of the currence of Indian political<br>philosophy that he could be a sounding<br>board from people like coka Western<br>diplomats in Cambodia dhar's<br>granddaughter recalls being taken as a<br>child to see jawahar onu in the early<br>1960s and narrow playfully knocking<br>together the heads of her and her<br>brother<br>um so um in the article uh which some of<br>you may have read read I I<br>developed<br>uh I de I developed ideas theoretical<br>ideas that come from this book by Hanah<br>Quan about the Cold War and um the point<br>of the book if I if I can summarize it<br>briefly is to when we think about the<br>Cold War period we traditionally think<br>in political international relations<br>terms of countries and relationship to<br>other countries and this um and Cambodia<br>and this view was seen as a country<br>which which chose neutrality and this<br>was a rational decision at that time and<br>hwan's work tries to look at the the<br>Cold War period more in terms of um of<br>the human relationships and what was<br>happening on the ground in terms of the<br>contradictions um in human terms that<br>that came out of the Cold War if I'm not<br>simplifying his work too much now my own<br>work I Tred to develop this in<br>relationship to dharmara and which<br>perhaps doesn't totally work because<br>darhar was not<br>really um you know the populist at large<br>he was also an elite um and yet what I<br>think is relevant is to<br>see countries not just you know Cambodia<br>the Soviet Union the United States all<br>sort of negotiating his great powers in<br>the Cold War but to think of this in<br>more human terms of people sort of<br>negotiate the way um so uh so what I've<br>tried to do is to show in my work how<br>daravar who<br>was did identify as very much as a<br>Buddhist um and yet he he was also at<br>this time playing a political role uh um<br>exactly what was his role as a as a<br>Buddhist monk who was also had a<br>political role at this time uh so we can<br>look at this period in various ways in<br>in my article I focus on the C War<br>element um it was also a<br>post-independence period for India and<br>for Cambodia for many Buddhist countries<br>at this time uh and<br>so my point is it was also<br>as in other contexts we might write<br>about it as the Buddha GI period period<br>when uh there were Buddhist celebrations<br>in in many countries in 1956 and<br>Cambodia and Thailand in 1957 and this<br>became typical of things that were<br>happening and that dharmara and the<br>people surrounding him were part of this<br>Ambit of things that were happening<br>which we can see through a lens of the<br>Cold War we can see through other lenses<br>as well and so this is part of the<br>argument I'm trying to make when talking<br>about him which will come out in this<br>um and some of this goes beyond the<br>before the independence period prior to<br>World War II now let's<br>see uh the mahabodhi society founded by<br>anari kadapa based in Kolkata was the<br>most prominent organization purporting<br>to represent International Buddhism<br>following the war there was a period in<br>which relics of the two Disciples of the<br>Buddha saruta and Moana repatriated<br>after decades and a London Museum became<br>a major focus of the mahab bodyi society<br>the society organized tours to bring the<br>relics to different places in India and<br>elsewhere before enshrining them in a<br>stupa in sanchi<br>um and well I've had discussions with um<br>with Elizabeth recently at this and<br>Elizabeth has of a great interest in the<br>figure of Suzanne carelis uh who was who<br>who was a French Colonial bureaucrat<br>who who and academic who uh encouraged<br>created played a major role in in in<br>creating and building up Buddhist<br>institutions in Cambodia in the in the<br>1920s and 30s and then later um ended up<br>in in India and was involved with uh<br>different societies the mahab society<br>the world Fellowship of Buddhist and one<br>question is whether way she may have<br>even been involved in this in this whole<br>process of having these relics return<br>from England and later on the the tours<br>that these took place um the tours were<br>wildly successful capturing the<br>imagination of the public more than<br>anticipated the relics attracted huge<br>crowds and ceremonies with speeches by<br>dignitaries greeted them wherever they<br>went helping to raise the profile of the<br>mahab Bodi society which still marks the<br>return of the relics to India one of its<br>major<br>accomplishments The Relic tours inspired<br>religious devotion but had a political<br>devote mention as well and the degree to<br>which they represented repossession of<br>cultural Traditions checked by<br>colonialism the last Foreign Tour of the<br>San relics was to Cambodia and took<br>place in<br>October of 5-4<br>1952 dharmar was among the groups of<br>monks accompanying the relics thus<br>returning to Cambodia still under French<br>control for the first time in 26 years<br>now um dhar's grandson who's<br>been a major informant for me um I'll<br>argue that daravar was the person who in<br>India um uh um promoted the idea of<br>taking the relics to Cambodia um uh<br>Elizabeth has speculated that uh suzan<br>Capell who's also in India at this time<br>may have also played a role in in this<br>process uh suzan Capell was had<br>historically had major connections with<br>some of the most prominent uh Buddhist<br>monks in Cambodia so these are are<br>questions that that one might raise but<br>the case he accompanied the relics<br>to uh um to Cambodia the plane was met<br>at the airport by King Ceno all his<br>Ministers of the state the Patriarchs of<br>the two Buddhist orders and 10,000 monks<br>and the relics were transported in<br>elaborate procession to the silver<br>pagota on the grounds of the Royal<br>Palace they were paraded around the city<br>the following days and ceremonies were<br>attended by representatives of<br>neighboring countries um similar to the<br>response to the relics in other<br>countries crowds of people from all<br>parts of Cambodia thronged to see them<br>on display and several donations were<br>collected to be used for two other<br>emblematic projects a hospital for monks<br>and a major Relic stupa to be built near<br>the railroad<br>station uh which I've written about<br>elsewhere we have no way of knowing to<br>what extent daravar had maintained his<br>connections to Cambodia his former wife<br>had remarried and his daughter whom he<br>had last seen as an infant was now an<br>adult a photograph from this period show<br>him at the airport with a Mahan Kai<br>patriarch Jun not he quickly reactivated<br>his connection to the circles of elite<br>he would have known and associated with<br>his youth he probably stayed on after<br>the rest of the delegation left since he<br>later made reference to having attended<br>the ground breaking of the hospital for<br>monks in February<br>1953 dhav virus soon connected with a<br>young king norom cuk this was a time of<br>hey historical change and the next 5<br>years the period when Dharma varus seems<br>to have been closest to Ceno was also<br>when cuk undertook some of the tasks<br>that would most Define him historically<br>leading Cambodia to Independence<br>affiliating himself with a non-aligned<br>movement and abdicating in order to take<br>on a more active political role and his<br>vision of a popular movement giving<br>direction to the<br>country um what's the oh oh but just<br>before we leave um uh I I don't know if<br>I'll try to expand but just yesterday<br>the day before uh uh there's news uh<br>that these same relics the relics of<br>saruta and magana uh will be uh this<br>coming week very shortly will be<br>traveling to uh<br>Bangkok and in for the birth<br>celebrations of the Thai King and um and<br>which to is just really fascinating<br>especially since I'm suppos to give this<br>this talk and and um and what<br>immediately comes to mind is to ask the<br>political implications that these Relic<br>tours um had political implications and<br>they they're never simply they're never<br>simply religious and at this time we<br>have the situation of of Modi the prime<br>minister<br>of uh the prime minister of India who<br>who from my recent trip to India it's<br>clear that in some ways he's he's<br>promoting he's promoting he for example<br>Buddhist studies he would like you know<br>uh people from neighboring countries to<br>study Buddhist St in India so he's a<br>promoting a relationship to the<br>neighboring Buddhist countries at the<br>same time the king of Thailand and<br>receiving these these these relics would<br>also o be<br>uh would<br>also uh would also receive some<br>legitimation by by the tour of these<br>relics to the country and so we we see<br>these this continuing role of these<br>relics even at the present time uh which<br>is just a footnote to what what we've<br>been talking about<br>um so um so do you want do you want to<br>take a break some okay maybe this would<br>be a good time okay okay okay sure just<br>get up and stretch your legs and okay<br>okay good<br>leave refilled my water glass yeah I<br>really have to go because I gota get my<br>kids<br>but and then I'm just thinking<br>I I don't think people can ask questions<br>verbally but can they put it in the<br>chat they usually manage to do that on<br>these um Zoom talks or possibly because<br>when um Angela appeared we were able to<br>talk to her we were able to talk and so<br>okay so maybe we can actually I was told<br>I have to leave audio myself because I<br>Echo yeah well you're in the same room<br>as me um but um yeah so yeah Angela's<br>there<br>so feel free to talk or ask questions<br>there just curious uh I don't I'm not<br>seeing the two Cambodian people that<br>were contacted no that's that's fine<br>that's fine but anyway let's go let's<br>break<br>you you man to ask from the Chris about<br>him he be free by then so you can you<br>can July June maybe yeah yeah so he be<br>free he be around too originally need

week<br>everything's this week that's okay yeah<br>okay so yeah no it's exciting to see<br>campus to be honest um it going so do<br>okay yes so I working on Buddhist groups<br>emerging in Sri Lanka like after the war<br>but during the war they were emerging<br>but after the war they were like kind of<br>flourishing in a way right yeah so it's<br>just uh they're kind of different from<br>what is expected in Buddhism in Sri<br>Lanka because it's more it was more<br>about like discipline and uh going to<br>the forest and truth seeking and all but<br>now that the these groups are<br>introducing new kind of Truth seeking<br>saying that meditation is like not<br>primary maybe it's there but it's not<br>the primary thing to like understand the<br>truth but they're saying that uh you<br>have to comprehend them yeah to like go<br>into that those status yeah so it's by<br>the war you mean World War<br>I sorry the War World War I the civil<br>war Civil War in yeah okay yeah yeah<br>yeah yeah yeah it's like continuous War<br>so it's<br>not when was<br>that well no no that that is significant<br>yeah it's a really cool project people<br>have not worked on these groups so yeah<br>no I I we can talk later I visited uh<br>Cambodian monks in in uh in Sri Lanka<br>yeah I saw the pictures okay and and so<br>Without Really Trying I be found myself<br>um sucked into some of what was going on<br>in Sri Lankan Buddhism as well<br>um yeah but we can talk about that in<br>another<br>context think while may be going around<br>and just introduce have you met all the<br>I I have met Elizabeth stent so actually<br>wut actually came to I was in Cambodia<br>and he he came and gave a talk and team<br>rap while I was there so we we got to<br>know each other and I I met the<br>venerable in Cambodia about several<br>years ago too yeah<br>so so but and we just met but I don't<br>know your<br>work yeah what are you working on um I<br>don't have a lot of work to show to be<br>honest with you at the moment I've just<br>just commenced my my master's program<br>here yeah and but what kind of things<br>are are you interested in um I<br>think look Hinduism will will be the<br>route I go

the third<br>time and and I'm not a expert on India<br>at all and yet each time I go I<br>have more aware<br>of different things and not you still<br>very superficial but there's definitely<br>a lot of fascinating<br>things and the ancient past the recent<br>past present so yeah yeah yeah and then<br>Angel Angela who you are up North but<br>you're with us by the miracle of Zoom<br>right you just got back from Southeast<br>Asia too yeah yeah I did it was great<br>yeah yeah it seemed like you from the<br>Facebook post look like you having a<br>good time um and seeing a lot so that's<br>cool yeah definitely the heat was<br>so and I was also able to meet Angela<br>and she was sort of a rushed encounter<br>one day but I accompanied her to visit<br>the anoran temple<br>seem sort of it seemed like you were<br>but yeah so so I'm just curious like<br>you're doing the<br>ma so has it changed has your trip to<br>Thailand and and Cambodia changed what<br>you're going to do at all or you still<br>thinking about that or yeah still<br>thinking about that yeah<br>yeah yeah it was awesome to you know<br>visit all those places um but I mean<br>I've still don't know where to start<br>with my thesis yet I've got a few months<br>to think about it but yeah I'm not<br>trying to nag I'm just curious because<br>yeah no no totally totally um um my<br>focus really is on on Buddhism it's just<br>really yeah and you said you've been to<br>India<br>they're both in the he's already<br>defended you know you know each other<br>yourself so I worked on um a Buddhist<br>text pretty much doing um translation<br>analysis and looking at the way people<br>use that text in particular the rual<br>life in the Contemporary Thailand L and<br>Cambodia and just got my a defend last<br>week<br>successfully and I'm doing a<br>revision um yeah as much as I<br>can<br>yeah but so it's possible to power<br>through if you keep going and<br>Venable<br>I'm I'm a PhD student here I just<br>submitted my PhD T last month and I'm<br>waiting for the result now and my T is<br>about um I translated life of Buddha<br>called Bama samti from Tha into English<br>and then I I choose the second chapter<br>the AO chapter is about the Buddha's<br>Enlightenment and I analyze the idea of<br>the Buddha Enlightenment and the author<br>interpret interpretation of the term<br>Daka which he said that is it mean<br>Enlightenment and I analyze what he<br>actually mean in in this<br>chapter you you also looked at the<br>biography of I I wrote the author yes I<br>I wrote biography of the author of pamas<br>as well his name is uh pwa he he is the<br>ninth Supreme patriarch of<br>Thailand he<br>composed sermon to to to preach inak to<br>preach to the king R the 4<br>inak it's a royal sermon it has there<br>are two versions four chapter versions<br>and 10 chapter versions I translate 10<br>years but I was just I was just thinking<br>when John was talking about dhara and<br>his career I was reminded of patriarch<br>sa who<br>was a monk and a very learned monk but<br>then<br>left the sa and married and had children<br>and then actually got in trouble with<br>the King and was a fugitive for a while<br>you know so like that you know like<br>monks don't just they're not static<br>they're human beings they they go<br>different and you keep talking about<br>dharma's grandson which sounds weird<br>like a monk with a grandson you know but<br>he read that he was married um and had a<br>before before he haded yeah and well I<br>don't know I again if there were<br>cambodians tuned in I<br>might recently in Cambodia uh a monk who<br>studied who got his Doctorate in India<br>and and a master's degree in Sri Lanka<br>and he had he was the director of the<br>Buddhist University and he had the title<br>of Samad and<br>um and those of us who worked on<br>Cambodian Buddhism know him very well<br>and then he left the monok which is on<br>the herd of for a monk who's already has<br>this title<br>and um people said that the last time<br>that had heard happened that uh a monu<br>had the title of Sam uh leaving the<br>monkhood was in the 19th century and so<br>uh so there are times when these things<br>happen but<br>it's it's notable when it does<br>so and usually reflects historical stuff<br>going on that political stuff historical<br>stuff it's not<br>just<br>personal yeah I think it's it's often<br>very complicated<br>yeah okay well shall we get okay well to<br>go on then um so I'm sorry I I my kids<br>but I will see you tomorrow okay okay<br>okay thank<br>you<br>um<br>um so anyway so we have this situation<br>where um in<br>1952 D returns to Cambodia after um a<br>long period of time and he connects to<br>the young key with Nom COK<br>and um at a Cru<br>moment and when cuk was making some of<br>the most momentous decisions he would<br>make<br>um<br>um as I said this was a heady time a<br>time of he historical change and the<br>next five years the period when daravar<br>seems to been close to cuk was also when<br>cuk undertook some of the tasks that<br>would most Define him historically<br>leading Cambodia to Independence<br>Affiliated himself with a non-aligned<br>movement and ABD ating in order to take<br>on a more active political role in his<br>vision of a popular movement giving<br>direction to<br>Country arar Allied himself COK and the<br>latter's drive for<br>Independence the most obvious way to see<br>dhar's connection to COK is with respect<br>to the young rulers push for<br>Independence and the ways in which he<br>turned toward India and the political<br>philosophy of nuu the details of Ceno's<br>maneuvering to bring about cod's<br>independence are well<br>documented he had already established<br>disbanded the National Assembly before<br>the October Relic tour in effect<br>dismantling the parliamentary system the<br>French had tried to set up and moving<br>toward taking the Reigns of power more<br>into his own<br>hands if daravar did not leave Cambodia<br>until after February he also been in<br>Cambodia when COK declared martial law<br>and vow to lead a campaign for National<br>Independence but daravar arrived in the<br>company of the sanchi relics and is also<br>telling that there's evidence of seeing<br>a continuing interest in relics over the<br>next few years on a trip to India<br>1955 and on the occasion of the Buddha<br>Janti celebrations in<br>1957 um occasions when dharmar was<br>present this in an odd way resonates<br>with the death by lukim of COK beloved<br>daughter<br>Kataba December 14th<br>1952 not long after The Relic tour at a<br>time when dharmar would have been in the<br>country one of Cook's biographers<br>suggested the crisis of his do<br>daughter's death may have had some<br>bearing in Cook's more intense<br>involvement in politics cuk would carry<br>with him a portion of his daughter's<br>ashes when he traveled even after he<br>built a stoop on the grounds of the<br>palace for the rest of the ashes in<br>1960 the stuper wear his own ashes would<br>be intered after his<br>death taking up his campaign for<br>Independence C first went to Paris where<br>he was rebuffed by the French next he<br>went to Washington where he felt<br>condescended to by American officials<br>but he increasingly became increasingly<br>adapted publicizing his plea<br>um<br>um control to Cambodia was turned over<br>in stages the date of full dependence is<br>often regarded as<br>1954 during cuk self style Royal<br>campaign Royal crusade in the summer of<br>1953 drar was apparently asked to Rally<br>support in India for Cambodian<br>Independence among the documents D RAR<br>kept as a July 22nd 1953 letter from the<br>US Embassy addressed to the free<br>Cambodia Committee in New Delhi<br>suggesting he played a major role in it<br>a formal September 1953 letter to<br>daravar from C and CM rip once the<br>letter had already reached an informal<br>agreement with the French thanks him for<br>his help<br>which enabled COK and the whole nation<br>to meet their goals there specific<br>reference to neru COK express it thanks<br>to all the cambodians in India who are<br>faithful and love me a handwritten<br>letter from cuk the following month has<br>a magazine uh has a tone of great<br>familiarity it's harder to understand<br>out of context but<br>States I quote in the future if matters<br>of this nature really come up again<br>please provide an explanation to the<br>country of India in such a way that they<br>understand the difficult painful<br>situation of our country we desire<br>Independence very much and we've taken<br>appropriate measures peacefully in order<br>to achieve<br>independence according to an ex-monk who<br>knew him since the<br>1950s dharmar had organized<br>demonstrations in front of the French<br>Embassy in New Delhi demanding Cambodian<br>Independence he draw members of the<br>cambod community a population in India<br>whose members believe they are of camb<br>codian descent he would surely have done<br>this only with the approval of Indian<br>officials to whom he was connected<br>perhaps neru<br>himself as it happened India was at that<br>time negotiating for the French Colonial<br>city of a piter to be incorporated in<br>the Indian<br>Union dharmara probably had nothing to<br>do with Nero's visit to Cambodia in 1954<br>when the Cambodian Independence was<br>still in its nasy the story is that neru<br>arranging a trip to Vietnam contacted<br>the Cambodian government to request<br>overfly clearance on his way to Vietnam<br>COK told him he would give clearance<br>only if Nero visited cambod as well but<br>Ceno's sense of rapport with Nero and<br>the attraction he had for Nero's<br>political philosophy may have served to<br>bring daravar perceived as connected to<br>India further into his inner<br>circle by 1954 daravar was assuming more<br>and more the role of Representative of<br>Cambodian Buddhism in international<br>Buddhist Affairs he published a short<br>coent article about Cambodian Buddhism<br>and the magazine Buddhist World in it he<br>prayed COK and the patriarch do not and<br>made reference to the historical<br>role of the French scholar Colonial<br>official suzan carelis in January a<br>burmes publication devoted to the six<br>Buddhist Council activities mentioned<br>that he had been in Burma recently since<br>it referred to him returning home to<br>Cambodia he seems to have stopped in<br>Burma on his way back to<br>Cambodia he was then back in rangon in<br>May is part of the Cambodian delegation<br>to the opening ceremonies of the sixth<br>Buddhist Council a landmark event in<br>terad and international Buddhism itself<br>representative of the possibilities of<br>global post-independence cultural<br>communities J not as the most senior<br>monk in Cambo the Cambodian delegation<br>made his opening remarks in French<br>before yielding the floor to daravar to<br>say something in English dhar's<br>knowledge of English and Burmese may<br>have made his inclusion in the<br>delegation seem natural soon after<br>returning to Cambodia from Burma he left<br>for<br>Japan a magazine photograph shows him<br>together with a second ranking Cambodian<br>monk who taught leading on high Airways<br>for Japan on June 21st he spent two and<br>a half months there brought relics to a<br>number of temples and attended the world<br>pacifist conference he accompanied COK<br>on the trip to Burma again in November<br>1954 it was also in 1954 that bur's<br>prime minister new sped the building of<br>a small ordination<br>Hall at the shoka<br>mission the year 1955 is when dhar's<br>connection to COK is most clearly<br>documented just as it is when COK stance<br>of neutrality came into clear focus it<br>was an important year for Ceno in<br>February he arranged for a referendum<br>that would be used to show overwhelming<br>support for him among the general<br>population later that month he received<br>a visit from the US Secretary of State<br>John Foster Dulles and negotiate<br>military aid he resisted the latter's<br>calls to join the Southeast Asia Treaty<br>Organization then on March 2nd in a<br>dramatic announcement on the radio he<br>declared his decision to abdicate and<br>turn the throne over to his father norom<br>suramarit he felt that as a political<br>leader rather than the king as the king<br>he would have more legitimacy in<br>organizing and leading a popular one<br>Party Movement he would set up a<br>political movement that he personally<br>had in effect a single nation political<br>party to be called<br>s usually translated as people's<br>socialist<br>movement only two years weeks after<br>abdicating COK went to India for eight<br>days this trip was planned before he<br>made the decision to abdicate but it<br>underlies his increasing orientation and<br>nar's political philosophy cic wrote of<br>the<br>trip<br>um well uh I I I'll skip that this visit<br>to India is often described as decisive<br>and cuk would over the years quite<br>consistently write in glowing terms<br>about neru and his influence over him<br>neru would publicly pray Seno's decision<br>to Advocate is a rather unique quote a<br>rather unique and possibly unparallel<br>thing I do not know if there is a sing<br>similar example anywhere else many kings<br>have disappeared as kings and people<br>have chosen their leaders in a different<br>way I do not know any example of a king<br>giving up his kingship in joining with<br>the people and functioning as the<br>national leader of the people that is<br>remarkable<br>um well in India C of met with members<br>of the Cambo community that is<br>this minority group in India who claimed<br>to be of Cambodia and the<br>sin following official business neru<br>arranged for COK to visit several Buddha<br>sites including sanchi where relics that<br>ATT toured Cambodia were now enshrined<br>thus making Buddhism and sok's past<br>connection to the RS an element of the<br>Diplomatic exchange dharmar no doubt<br>accompanied him the times of India wrot<br>incense was burned and suts were cited<br>by Buddhist priests from Cambodia as the<br>prince knelt<br>down it was at the end of this trip on<br>March 22nd that c visited the mahabodhi<br>society offices in Kolkata together with<br>davara sangar rashita would recall<br>dharmara being referred to there as<br>Ceno's advisor<br>in this address cuk thanked the society<br>for sending the relics to Cambodia cuk<br>with daravar accompaning him then went<br>on to Burma before participating in the<br>Asian African conference in<br>bandom um well here I could have shown<br>the slide earlier and uh the point is<br>that davara this was a time when many<br>things are happening in World Buddhism<br>and uh this um important important<br>Buddhist event um in which<br>um uh which which called itself<br>um um<br>uh<br>uh a conclave parallel two<br>conclaves that had occurred in the<br>historical path took place in Burma<br>between 1954 and<br>1956 um and here is the list of<br>attendees at the Asia African conference<br>in bond a very different kind of event<br>which is not considered Buddhist at all<br>but was<br>in in political<br>historical terms one of the key events<br>of of that time um<br>uh in a book in the 1955 Asian African<br>con darar is included in the list of<br>delegates<br>um it is probable<br>that sen was inactive dialogue with<br>davan brought him along for his language<br>skills and as someone who could help him<br>interpret what was going on it's also<br>possible at this point he simply found<br>daravar a source of comfort spiritual<br>empowerment after Bond daravar<br>accompanied the Cambodian diplomatic<br>team setting up formal relations with<br>India at about the same time C named The<br>Boulevard in pumpen after neru daravar<br>was at this<br>clearly identified as an adviser to<br>Ceno what should be emphasized is that<br>dhar's role while very much that of a<br>Buddhist monk also had clear political<br>overtones by this time davara had come<br>to the attention of us officials in<br>plumin and before long an invitation was<br>extended to him by the US information<br>agency to attend the conference on<br>education in Washington<br>DC well this was in some ways a logical<br>extension of his activities as C it also<br>represented a shift from the role he<br>assumed in the Cambodian Indian<br>Nexus and cambod is developing positive<br>neutrality to a direct connection with<br>one of the Cold War Powers and one with<br>a thinly veiled agendas again we see<br>public recognition of his role as a monk<br>while at the same time having political<br>undercurrents this was not an Asia<br>Foundation sponsored trip but because<br>Asia Foundation was host davar in San<br>Francisco we learned a good about him<br>from Asia Foundation<br>archives um a letter to the Asia<br>Foundation president from the Asia<br>Foundation representative in Cambodia<br>says of<br>davara quote domestic policy<br>notwithstanding the venerables in<br>contested but cambodia's most<br>interesting monk fluent an English<br>French tie in several Indian languages<br>his 20 years outside of Cambodia at<br>giving him given him a perspective far<br>wider than that possessed by any other<br>Monk and the majority of lay leaders<br>an almost unmun interest in Social<br>progress and economic growth and he's<br>able to judge his country severely and<br>constructively can I can I just break in<br>does anyone here know what the Asia<br>Foundation<br>is do you know come on tell<br>us Asia Foundation yeah it's like uh<br>it's an organization which is like<br>funding different things that's in Sri<br>Lanka yeah it's yeah<br>yeah my third talk was spoke<br>specifically on Asia foundation and um<br>Asia Foundation was found in this in<br>this period and um and historically it<br>had ties to the CIA and it was funded by<br>the CIA uh yeah it was funded by the CIA<br>uh and it had and it had uh a<br>pro-american anti-communist agenda but<br>but it was also involved in<br>uh what we know now which is only coming<br>out that it was it encouraged Buddhist<br>activities partly with the idea that<br>encouraging Buddhism would be a way of<br>fighting against communism and so uh you<br>know this will be my talk on Wednesday<br>and so uh this even the Asia Foundation<br>is uh um you know it's a it's a complex<br>it's a complex them so yeah so<br>davara trip in 1955 the United States<br>was us um funded by the Asia found no it<br>was primarily funded by the US state<br>department okay but it had supplementary<br>funding by the Asia Foundation uh and on<br>his way back from Washington DC he<br>stopped in San Francisco and there he<br>was hosted by the Asia foundation and so<br>some of the memos that we learned about<br>this trip well the Asia Foundation has<br>good archives and a lot of my I did a<br>lot of archival work at the Asia<br>Foundation archives and that's why um<br>and I I also look for US state<br>department archives and there there are<br>many fewer of them than they are um<br>uh<br>um<br>so um but to return<br>um thep was from November 1955 to<br>February 1956 and his request the Asia<br>Foundation paid for him to spend some<br>time in Japan on the turn leg on August<br>1955 State Department Telegram and for<br>preparation for his visit said his<br>catholicity of Interest admittedly<br>involves difficulty<br>although um<br>a ptical factor and political interest<br>must not repeat not be forgotten stress<br>should be laid on us educational AC to<br>primary and secondary<br>education<br>um<br>and the only documentation I found of<br>his days in Washington DC is a<br>confidential memorandum of his<br>conversation on successive days with<br>State Department officials Kenneth Young<br>and Walter s Robertson despite some<br>token references to education he was<br>officially there attending a conference<br>on<br>education these conversations were<br>primarily concerned primarily with<br>political issues daravar showed his<br>continuing animous against the French<br>quote he did blame the French for much<br>of the trouble in Cambodia at the<br>present time and in the recent past<br>point of mentioning that English rather<br>than French with the language of the<br>Bandon conference he seems a pains to<br>stress that neither Cambodia nor India<br>was likely to become communist um qu<br>he's convinced that Cambodia will never<br>go communist for it's against all<br>principles the Cambodian people know and<br>in which they believe there's never been<br>native grown communism Cambodia what has<br>existed is grown in Vietnam or in other<br>countries<br>um<br>um but to the general public in the<br>United States davar May much maintain<br>the role of a terada monk and and it is<br>the ambiguous role that most interest<br>Us in keeping with our goal from Quan to<br>explore the underlying cultural Links of<br>the era he gave talks on Buddhism in New<br>York City and at K State and Stanford<br>universities and he traveled to several<br>other cities as well he visited the<br>Berkeley Buddhist<br>center uh I think this is a picture of<br>him at the Berkeley Buddhist<br>center<br>um uh and the reception with 26 guests<br>was held for him by the Asia foundation<br>in San Francisco mostly people connected<br>with Buddhism or religious studies<br>um um I think I'll skip over some things<br>here um um he connected<br>with an author Robert Baler uh who was<br>um had a lot of Hollywood Connections<br>and um<br>Baler<br>uh Baler was connected with the yoga<br>teacher ramwari uh no um uh Indra Davy<br>um who had known daravar in the 40s um<br>they took them to the set of the king of<br>I King and I this is a a bizarre picture<br>where dharmar and his robes is next to Y<br>brener who um from my era who know this<br>movie The King and I from the 1950s he's<br>in costume and then he's there with um<br>Andra Davy and and B balser would later<br>travel<br>to uh travel to Cambodia um where he met<br>daravar he ordained two weeks as a monk<br>uh and Baler is one of the primary<br>sources<br>of one of the relatively few people who<br>wrote about darhar in this period<br>um<br>um but let's skip<br>to the Future then there began to be all<br>this has showed sort of his High Point<br>how he flourished in the<br>mid-50s and and he was he was recognized<br>by senok uh The Head of State in<br>Cambodia by by hok's parents who were<br>the king and queen um he was recognized<br>by the US US Embassy he was flown to the<br>United States he had all these<br>International connections with different<br>International Buddhist organis ations<br>but things began to fall apart for him<br>um and things began to be problematic<br>for him<br>um<br>uh is that clear whether Dar ever<br>seriously considered abandoning his base<br>in India when he spent considerable time<br>in Cambodia although he sometimes gave<br>that impression as residents in India at<br>Independence he had rights of citizen<br>ship however according to the ex monks<br>gaman<br>samb repeating dhar's anecdotes he was<br>given a Cambodian passport after that<br>country became independent as the monks<br>tell the story daravar was later<br>confronted by neru overh holding two<br>passports he chose to keep the Cambodian<br>one at a period when he was being<br>invited uh to represent the country at<br>Buddhist councils and meetings of heads<br>of<br>state<br>um the delicateness of this position IND<br>is underlined by a time in the 1950s<br>when daravar opened the show commission<br>to Tibetan Refugee monks the beginning<br>of another important chapter in<br>international Buddhism during one of his<br>absences from India he put an English<br>born Tibetan Buddhist freed to Betty in<br>charge Betty would later become the<br>first Western woman to be ordained as a<br>Tibetan nun she was at the show<br>commission when the Dal Lama and the<br>ponin Lama visited December<br>1956 Betty was at the sh commission<br>following the official Indian<br>celebrations of Buddha<br>gianti English monk sarash was part of a<br>group of Buddhist Specialists invited by<br>India to tour Buddhist sites he stated<br>at the sh Commission in Delhi while<br>there he realized that Betty was making<br>moves toward taking control of the<br>mission according to sarash and nephew<br>wired daravar about this and he returned<br>immediately to deal with the<br>situation the challenges to dhar's<br>position in Cambodia were more profound<br>even before he traveled to the United<br>States there were indications of<br>tensions between him and the Buddhist<br>hierarchy the August 1955 Asia<br>Foundation letter which praised him as<br>Cambodia most interesting monk also<br>stated although he occupies no active<br>position in internal Buddhist Affairs he<br>remains closely identified with coka and<br>the present political campaign by doing<br>so there are indication that his<br>standing with other members of the<br>hierarchy which is predominantly inclin<br>toward the Democratic party is not<br>particularly<br>high this may or may not be an<br>description of the PO political dynamics<br>of the monkhood although it hints that<br>they were more complicated in this<br>period than it's usually recognized what<br>is clear is that by the following year<br>the monastic leadership had managed<br>voice its indignation that daravar<br>essentially outside of the Cambodian<br>monastic B had been invited to the<br>United<br>States why would he be invited to a<br>White House conference on education set<br>of the second ranking Buddhist monk who<br>T who at the time of darar STP was<br>probably already positioned to head the<br>ply School following am's death in the<br>end us officials decided it was<br>necessary to invite who taught the<br>following year a letter from the<br>Cambodian head of the Asia Foundation to<br>the head of foundation stated quote for<br>the benefit of the home office it should<br>be pointed out that daravar is<br>considered an outcast by traditional<br>members of the Cambodian hierarchy and<br>by who taught in particular for this<br>reason it is not recommended that<br>Illusions be made about daravar during<br>Hut visit it was to atone for dhar's<br>visit that the embassy has awarded a<br>bhat<br>um<br>um in my interview with K pamar let's<br>see here's again a slide about Robert<br>Bower's ordination which we won't talk<br>about<br>um uh and here we<br>are um there's the one picture um above<br>of of davara in when he first came to<br>Cambodia picture together with the<br>Cambodian patriarch uh chunat here<br>pictures of chunat and who taught who<br>who were the height of the Cambodian<br>monastic hierarchy at this time uh and<br>so we have a situation where when<br>daravar first arrived he seemed to be<br>welcomed by the hierarchy but he began<br>to be perceived as a threat um and<br>tensions<br>had Arisen by the end of the<br>1950s um in my interview with Kama he<br>said that cambodi monk had finally came<br>to assum a unified stance against davar<br>when he called the Mahan patriarch junat<br>communist it is ult to know how to<br>interpret this K also said that Dharma<br>was not in the long run particularly<br>ideological politically if dharmar made<br>a statement like this was no doubt only<br>one of a number of political and<br>personal factors coming into play in his<br>growing tension with the monastic<br>hierarchy Queen kosak asked daravar as a<br>compromise measure to go back to India<br>some of dhar's family members have<br>suggested that another factor in its<br>fall from Factor was his friendliness<br>with two figures do Chuan and samser<br>around this time involved in plots can't<br>see<br>um<br>so this resulted in<br>him after<br>1960 he did not go back to he went made<br>one uh trip back<br>to um Cambodia uh in 1962 at which time<br>he brought two of his<br>grandchildren back to India to live with<br>him and the show commission uh he<br>apparently was back in Cambodia briefly<br>in 1969 after attending the conference<br>in<br>in in Saigon um but this there was this<br>period in the 1950s a very intense<br>involvement with Cambodia and with<br>Cambodian leader nordom COV and this<br>ended at this time and we<br>have um different epics in his life he<br>would go on to do other interesting<br>things um just a few slides showing that<br>here he is I'm at n's fam funeral in<br>1962 um um this is a whole sort of<br>different chapter which which could they<br>began to<br>be that pict Western hippies going to<br>India uh there was what was called the<br>hippie Trail um from from Europe to<br>Crossing Afghanistan arriving in India<br>and for various reasons one of the one<br>of the person who drove these buses to<br>India discovered darhar and his Temple<br>and this led to some major connections<br>which would change the life of dharmara<br>and um this put him in touch with<br>um this was you know he was a Buddhist<br>monk and yet he connected with<br>uh and I with followers of GFF which is<br>another religious leader of the 20th<br>century and the person who's connected<br>was named JG Bennett um and this is a<br>whole different complex chapter in his<br>life and um<br>so I won't go into this eventually end<br>up in the United<br>States um and he had many Western<br>followers at the same time he founded<br>two important Cambodian temples in the<br>United States who are which are among<br>the most important temples in Cambodian<br>Temple still today in the United States<br>um um let me just read from my<br>conclusion and I hope I haven't gone too<br>far off of the topics<br>in to so that this conclusion through<br>revent all of this can be seen as part<br>of the culture and social maneuvering<br>taking place at a moment of historical<br>conjuncture what Quan would call the<br>transition from Colonial to a bipolar<br>order my intention is not to show<br>politics lurking behind the surface of<br>cultural matters with to show the two is<br>inextricably<br>linked davar story at the interes of<br>this process helps shed light on the<br>historical conjuncture is not difficult<br>to compile a list of 20th century<br>Buddhist<br>figures whose impact was significantly<br>in shaped by they having cross borders<br>westerners such as Ananda mataya loata<br>suzan Capel F betti and sarash and Asian<br>figures such as anagarika dharmapala the<br>chatu Fuji asenka and the Dal Lama<br>davara actually news some of these other<br>figures and he was in in some ways a<br>more minor figure but he illustrates how<br>transnational Buddhists could figure in<br>emerging cultural and political<br>narratives although we should not reduce<br>his Charisma to the fact that in various<br>situations he could represent a link to<br>and other of significance to his<br>interlocutor this is doubtless part of<br>what was going on assuming more<br>far-reaching implications and Times of<br>change a Ros and crance a gildon<br>character not Prince H he nevertheless<br>helps to throw to relief The Arc of the<br>drama as the whole thus he helps us to<br>see that J Who Tau so often depicted as<br>Timeless icons of cambod budhism were to<br>degrees still vulnerable in the 1950s<br>and defensive in maneuvering toward the<br>positions of prominence in the C era<br>more at the heart of this article darar<br>helps us to see the degree which Ceno's<br>neutrality while surely motivated by<br>Cold War geopolitical rationality was<br>also being negotiated with cultural and<br>interpersonal reference COK also not<br>sought not only a political and economic<br>but also cultural basis for<br>sovereignty the consolation of dhar's<br>connections reminds us of some of the<br>odd J spicious of what occurred<br>simultaneously in the period how the<br>Heyday of Chad and Hut was the same<br>period in which and bedgar converted to<br>Buddhism and the Dal Lama fled to India<br>how Buddha gianti celebrations occurred<br>in the same epic as the abandon<br>conference and the question of the<br>degree to which there was an underlying<br>Li logic to the ways post Independence<br>National identities were<br>crystalizing dhar's 1956 and SIU 1965<br>Artic essay article on Buddha socialism<br>which I've somehow not really talked<br>about but which are in my article we're<br>both products of this epic and both<br>perhaps illustrate how societies were<br>groping toward a new relationship<br>between religion and the state monastic<br>bureaucracies like those of Cambodia<br>were in fact changing in relation<br>Independence and bureaucratic<br>modernity this study shows that the<br>relationship between religion and the<br>state is also Illustrated through the<br>ways in which individual actors like<br>darara would in practice negotiate their<br>way through things like Relic tours<br>invitations to conferences on education<br>and Millennial Buddhist<br>celebrations which have their own<br>relation to political realities this<br>gives us a glimpse of what the Cold War<br>could mean on the ground so I think<br>that's that's a point to end<br>here so<br>Tibetan is it a Tibetan<br>so I guess I don't know what it is it<br>looks like it's the Buton silk<br>scarf so somebody's may be given it to<br>the so yes I've got some question so so<br>did you did mention about his Ro on like<br>C yes um making some decisions on um<br>Cambodia so can can you can you<br>elaborate more like his roles on C in<br>particular<br>and what he make a decision for for a<br>Cambodia or something like that so what<br>influence<br>him we we don't have any clear evidence<br>that he influenced any particular any<br>specific decision by Ceno what we know<br>is that in this period it was the same<br>period when uh Cambodia had just<br>received achieved<br>Independence that<br>cuk happened to move in the direction of<br>neru and neru had and was associated<br>with a non-aligned movement and had a<br>philosophy of<br>neutrality now there were various<br>reasons why um Ceno would have chosen<br>neutrality um uh and but in partly these<br>were part of the terms uh that he had<br>agreed<br>to when Cambodia achieved Independence<br>but nevertheless there was a group of<br>leaders um who came together at the<br>Bandon conference<br>including uh neru chin line Chin Li<br>sukarno who had developed a philosophy<br>of of neutrality and<br>um and C<br>some of these ideas came specifically<br>from Nero and cuk was attracted to these<br>ideas and he was attracted to<br>Naro and so the question is did dhara<br>play a role in<br>facilitating Ceno's connection to Naro<br>uh it seemed like<br>that um he may have and<br>or that cuk in any case identified<br>darhar with nuu we don't know how close<br>davar really was to Nero we know he was<br>close to Nero's family and and yet cuk<br>was trying to move toward closer to neru<br>and he perhaps used<br>dharmara to to do that um in a part of<br>the article which I somehow<br>didn't uh talk about s didn't manage to<br>get get to which I seem to in order<br>because paper seem to be talk seem to be<br>running too long I talk about dharmara<br>wrote a little booklet in was published<br>in<br>1956 um at the time of the Buddha gianti<br>and he has certain ideas about what<br>Buddhism is um its relationship to peace<br>importance of Asoka and the tradition of<br>Asoka as a historical<br>figure now this this is in<br>the<br>and somewhat later well the earliest<br>references to C of talking about<br>Buddhist socialism actually occur in the<br>in the late 50s um but in the 60s uh cuk<br>gave a talk which is published this in<br>different journals affiliated with<br>cambod<br>and um and translated both French and<br>English um about C's idea of Buddhist<br>socialism Buddhist socialism and what I<br>argue in my paper is that there seems to<br>be<br>some some conceptual parallels between<br>what dharmar wrote in his pamphlet and<br>what Ceno wrote it perhaps pushing<br>things a little bit too much to say that<br>there's any clear evidence that cuk was<br>influenced by<br>dharmara but the influence is either<br>that what I imagine in my mind is there<br>was certain certain conversation there<br>and that um certain ideas that were in<br>circulation at that<br>time uh<br>were perhaps more in circulation in the<br>world of Indian Buddhism that dhara<br>populated ideas<br>about about Buddhist connection with<br>World Peace um about the importance of<br>the historical figure of aoka for<br>example that that we<br>find that we find in C's thinking at<br>this time as<br>well they came<br>from possibly to degree from the<br>influence of dharmara but also the fact<br>that they repres represented a common<br>intellectual atmosphere that they they<br>represent ideas that were in circulation<br>at that time and so<br>dharmara whether can really prove that<br>he had great<br>influence he was a figure he was sort of<br>part of the ambients at that time part<br>of the part of the intellectual climate<br>of that time which which sought ways of<br>com finding a combination a connection<br>between between political reality<br>and and religious reality and of course<br>the there two other figures wrote<br>significant work about Buddhist social<br>Buddhist socialm one of was unu the<br>other one was um uh the other one was uh<br>udas biku at a later dat and so if we<br>look at C's works you<br>is it's not a<br>major intellectual uh analysis of the<br>nature of Buddhist socialism and yet<br>it's typical of his time and typical of<br>certain ideas that were in SEC<br>circulation in time and in that to that<br>us thank<br>you<br>um ask question so so were there like<br>any other like uh influence IAL monks of<br>like<br>intellectuals at the same time as um a<br>part of U the m so in in Cambodia were<br>there any<br>other influentials intellectual<br>intellectuals or like<br>Scholars<br>who well most of the literature that's<br>been written about is these monks that<br>um who were uh they were sort of at the<br>center of the hierarchy and so okay this<br>was the time of junad and Hut they<br>didn't speak English though oh okay okay<br>and so um and come here<br>they they were there's been a lot of<br>literature about reform movements in<br>Cambodian Buddhism at this time which<br>had some parallels and connections with<br>reform movements that were taking place<br>in Thailand okay and and so<br>um uh<br>junat and huat were very much at the<br>Forefront of these reform reform<br>movements in in Cambodia this was Indina<br>and French Indina yeah go south well uh<br>yeah I mean<br>yeah so these arean These are the<br>leading lights of of Cambodian mhis at<br>this time in the 1950s and 1960s and of<br>course there were other scholar Monks at<br>the same<br>time um later on if you get into the<br>into the 70s and there were<br>other monks who became associated with<br>the the Comm Republic um who were also<br>very influential intellectual um so<br>darar was<br>um he was not a scholar monk he was not<br>exactly an intellectual monk in the same<br>way as these people word he did not<br>write the booklet I put in the readings<br>is really a fairly minor minor book uh<br>again with the idea it it's not a major<br>Buddhist study by any means although it<br>again it it's a hint at some of the<br>intellectual currents at that time uh<br>and for me<br>it it's a clue uh I mean all these<br>different things I've learned about<br>him uh he's not someone we particularly<br>associate with texts really what we know<br>about him we know from little things<br>here and there which somehow add up<br>to he was definitely a very charismatic<br>figure and and that is<br>what he continues to hold a great deal<br>of Fascination for for certain people<br>who had contact with him and whether<br>he'll be remembered maybe he'll be<br>remembered by because some crazy<br>Scholars like myself will write about<br>him but<br>um he you know about<br>um he was not say an intellectual figure<br>like Buddha niku um he and yet he<br>was he created<br>certain you know if you talk about what<br>he accomplished in his life that some<br>would say he didn't accomplish that much<br>but he founded this um he founded a<br>major temple in India at the time there<br>were not so many Buddhist temples in<br>India he founded two Cambodian temples<br>in the United States<br>and but<br>uh more than that he's remembered as as<br>being this charismatic figure who some<br>people felt<br>had uh you know had he magical VI he had<br>magical powers and uh uh and yet he was<br>considered a he was also a teacher of<br>meditation<br>and well was he an important teacher of<br>meditation I don't know but he the<br>people who remember most as a teacher of<br>meditation were westerners uh not<br>cambodians and<br>so he was an interesting contradictory<br>figure<br>but what I tried to talk about in this<br>article is the degree to which in this<br>brief moment he was connected to people<br>of power<br>politically later in his career he<br>became the sort of he came to the United<br>States he went to the United States he<br>he had<br>um followers he was sort of like<br>a he was like a feature at spiritual<br>Retreats um he had certain followers who<br>are for whom he was the most important<br>teacher in their lives uh but he did not<br>create a movement he did not um Star<br>Wars oh I forgot you forgot that ref<br>okay but<br>I this is I've avoided talking about<br>this but finally I gave a talk to some<br>students um and and Elizabeth says I<br>have to mention this whenever I talk<br>about dharmara uh and his followers<br>believed that he was a model for the<br>figure of of Yoda in Star Wars<br>and this is and I I was sold this is on<br>someone writes about this<br>on on the internet and I was able to<br>find that on the internet but I did<br>finally find it and<br>so and but here here's someone writing<br>on the internet one time I flew from<br>Alaska in Washington DC for work while I<br>was traveling there I contacted a fellow<br>I want to meet with exploring areas of<br>his work in the nonprofit sector when I<br>arrived at his office was shown I was<br>very surprised there in the formal DC<br>office were two large frame posters one<br>was at the movie Dune the other was on<br>the movie Star Wars asking about this I<br>found worked on both movies the theme of<br>Star Wars is all about Buddhism that's<br>what what I wanted I wonder if the movie<br>Producers knew how close they came in so<br>many ways when the movie was being plan<br>the team was looking for a good model<br>for Yoda looking for a real master<br>someone on the team new of Bon several<br>were dispatched to visit bante after<br>introductions they interviewed Bonte<br>videotaped him photographed him and<br>generally speaking soaked up his<br>mannerism and such much later on when<br>Star Wars finally came out his friend<br>took bante to the movie halfway through<br>the movie bante stood up in the theater<br>and pointing to Yoda explained that's me<br>sure enough they really did it right the<br>Expressions the ears the height B was<br>short the accent and wouldn't you know<br>it Yoda is green so I<br>mean I I don't think you can prove this<br>but um followers of daravar believe that<br>believe that uh he was used at least<br>partially as a model for the figure of<br>Yoda in Star Wars and and so again I I<br>would love to I would love if there was<br>proof of this but what we can say is<br>that it's something that Western<br>followers of dharmara believe and and so<br>it becomes part of the myth surround me<br>so he and<br>um yeah if I looked of the looked at the<br>I've seen videos of daravar I've seen<br>Star Wars movies I think it<br>does it does seem but but then I'm I'm<br>biased and so but that's another<br>interesting thing that I we probably<br>will never able to prove and yet<br>it's part<br>of part of the<br>whole<br>um Mythic reality surrounding<br>so so in a way he was like a he was<br>being funded by Asian foundation and CIA<br>and that fraction of politics and then<br>in a way he was unconscious<br>consciously clinking socialism and<br>Buddhism also is it well he did not<br>really receive uh much other Cambodian<br>monks did receive okay receive funding<br>from the Asia Foundation uh he actually<br>did not although on that one trip he got<br>he they the Asia Foundation was based in<br>San Francisco hosted him and so they had<br>they were connected with him they knew<br>him the the officers of the Asia<br>foundation in in Cambodia knew him uh<br>and at first were very friendly to him<br>later on there are later um memos from<br>the Asia Foundation sort of clearly<br>wanted to distance themselves from him<br>uh because it became clear that the<br>monastic hierarchy in<br>Cambodia was not close to him and they<br>realized that it was politically not so<br>wise to connect<br>so<br>he in general<br>he was a strong from his time in India<br>he was a strong believer<br>in in neutralism and pacifism uh he he<br>had a strong connection to cup<br>um uh even after cuk was deposed in a<br>coup in 1970<br>he maintained connections to Ceno so he<br>he's tends to be associated in<br>his<br>in in the public mind between COK and<br>him he also seemed to have some<br>connection to people who were who fought<br>against Ceno so he was connected with a<br>lot of Cambodian Elites some proo some<br>against um<br>uh politically I don't think he was<br>clearly he was clearly political at all<br>but<br>um uh he had coming from<br>India<br>he he did tend to support peace<br>movements he<br>supported he was actually not completely<br>vegetarian he sometimes ate<br>fish but he he supported vegetarianism<br>he<br>supported peace movements and<br>he yoga is not of course yoga is not a<br>Buddhist practice in itself but he he<br>supported Yoga practices as well so<br>that they're not Cambodian they're not<br>Cambodian and they're not necessarily<br>Buddhist and yet and that and yet there<br>are things that westerners for example<br>who are interested in Buddhism would<br>probably also tend to be<br>interested so I just looking at the<br>front of this AR ad dama in<br>India this pamphlet yes so that is a tie<br>Organization no and I I looked for that<br>that<br>it's the the<br>person there's a name listed there and<br>that<br>person I I did some research into that<br>and perhaps you know more that he's he<br>uh<br>uh I think AR it's not prop name it's<br>that's the name of the organization but<br>there's a Thai name who was sponsoring<br>this organization and and then<br>Mr and he had uh he's mentioned in<br>another of the books about Tha Buddhism<br>in this period and he he sponsored a lot<br>of Publications by budh buddhadasa biku<br>uh and so he had TI connections no he<br>had davara<br>H uh darar had significant Thai<br>connections throughout his life he he<br>went to Thailand<br>frequently uh and he we know<br>from from the book by Baler he he had<br>ready access at the Tha Patriarchs so he<br>was he was highly respected in Thailand<br>um<br>and but what I would love is that<br>to know as if there might be any<br>documentation Tha language about his<br>visits to Thailand but I probably will<br>never unless one of you is going to come<br>across them I may never be able to learn<br>about<br>that we asked CH we went to see CH and<br>then you talked to that Mark right right<br>that was that was the name we were<br>trying to<br>remember yeah um so there was an older<br>monk oh and you talk to him right well<br>no that was no that was another another<br>story the one at wple CH tip that that's<br>another another mck he had no connection<br>with daravar but there was a<br>um<br>um Alo he had connect the main thing is<br>he had tie connections that you haven't<br>really had the<br>opportunity yeah<br>yeah no I was just thinking you know<br>you're asking about Cambodian high<br>ranking<br>intellectuals and there's this language<br>barrier that becomes bigger after World<br>War II because before World War II<br>French people spoke more French and then<br>the UN is sort of set up and English<br>becomes more and more the language<br>because of the military success of the<br>Americans um and then the monks who were<br>and in Vietnam too because they all<br>spoke so there's these amazing French<br>intellectual monks in Vietnam that we<br>don't know anything about because they<br>don't the only one we do know about is<br>tikn Han who happened to speak English<br>and went to the United States and you<br>know well I mean yeah eventually settle<br>in France but um he was able to preach<br>in English but you know like this seems<br>to be the split this linguistic split<br>happening after World War II in<br>particular<br>yeah well I mean Vietnam is a whole<br>different um all of blacks but um people<br>still speak French though educated<br>people still speak French hoi men spoke<br>French you know I mean well well yes and<br>more importantly they speak Vietnamese<br>and uh um a lot of important work in<br>Vietnamese has not been translated but<br>um speak<br>um<br>uh but there were different intellectual<br>movements uh definitely in the<br>post-independence period of um not<br>necessarily Buddhist movements in<br>Cambodia but um there<br>were uh most of the work that has been<br>done from this<br>period has focused on the reform<br>movements that were taking place at this<br>time and<br>uh<br>and that's in French well something<br>French but it's my an had yeah and<br>um yeah the sources are French so so<br>this is an issue that some<br>important sources about Cambodian<br>Buddhism are in French and many<br>scholars including<br>to off confronting<br>those those sources because it's just<br>more<br>difficult like if if you read this<br>article like the Asia Foundation is<br>going you know darh is really<br>interesting he speaks English he's<br>outgoing he's liberal Court tat sits and<br>meditates all the time and he speaks<br>French did not speak French that well<br>either hardly any french and doesn't<br>want<br>but fat was you know in the long run<br>had perhaps you could argue had much<br>more more impact in Cambodia than<br>daravar did in Cambodia dhar's<br>impact to the extent that existed was<br>not very much in Cambodia<br>itself um and and yet daravar<br>is<br>is one of his followers said I used the<br>word colorful and he said colorful is<br>the right word because he he believed in<br>meditation on colors and he he believed<br>in color healing so I feel like I can<br>use the word colorful<br>so his Fascination is as a colorful<br>figure and<br>that in some ways that superficial that<br>um and yet<br>uh and<br>yet and yet he has a Fascination to to<br>to to some people the more you look into<br>him the<br>more<br>um he continues to Fascinate and this<br>picture and there<br>was I was in India recently and the<br>reason this picture is remembered is<br>because um there was an important figure<br>in Indian history who uh led the<br>resistance<br>against against the British during World<br>War II his name was Chandra subas Bose<br>and who<br>and Bose had already died at this point<br>but there's many people in India today<br>there's a sort of cult around Bose and<br>um and there's people believe he did not<br>really die when he you you're not and<br>you obviously know probably more than I<br>do about<br>this and<br>um well the thing about this picture is<br>that it was taken at at dhar's funeral I<br>mean at Nero's funeral and there's<br>davara and the photographer took this<br>picture and people thought it looked<br>like it looked like Bose and so there<br>was this feure say Bose is still alive<br>and and people sought out dhar in the<br>temple believed he he looked like B um<br>and and by chance I was in Kata I by<br>chance I I went to a museum in honor of<br>Bose and I saw these pictures and Bose<br>also sometimes dressed up like a<br>religious figure and he had this<br>charismatic aura about him and and I<br>have to say that they did sort of look<br>like the pictures of davara and<br>and so daravar<br>had a kind of Charisma and somehow that<br>came across in this picture in such a<br>way that people associated with B but um<br>what does that tell us it doesn't mean<br>the dharm ofar was really significant<br>and it's I try to argue that daravar was<br>perhaps he was not significant in the<br>same way<br>that sort of historical political<br>religious figures are you know he didn't<br>write a major book he didn't um<br>he didn't you know there are not we<br>cannot say concretely that he influenced<br>COK in making this decision or that<br>decision and<br>yet and yet<br>somehow I feel that by looking at him we<br>can learn something about that time<br>period and about<br>the the relationship of Buddhism to<br>politics and that time period that's<br>that's the argument I'm trying to make<br>so<br>else<br>tired I<br>think the whole idea of this thing being<br>three hours is I'm just getting to<br>room we it doesn't yeah yeah I think<br>this is a good<br>link<br>so so okay so let's just have a chat<br>about<br>tomorrow what's the reading for<br>tomorrow sorry guys<br>uh so I know it's a real pain to read<br>this stuff but have a<br>look everybody know what a semma<br>is semma boundary well tomorrow it's<br>really going to be useful if you know<br>what a semma<br>is okay you know what a s is<br>explain can you please<br>explain SEMA yeah um just<br>briefly like um there<br>a Mark I think a sign is a sign on a<br>Mark L like a stone<br>to indicate the<br>boundary mtic<br>boundary in which the monks would do<br>their activity within the<br>SEMA<br>um there there are a lot of like<br>interpretation and the rules and stuff<br>um regarding to to that there is a rule<br>to set up the SEMA<br>so it's sort of compulsory to set up the<br>the boundary for for monks or for<br>monastic activity like here in in the so<br>when when like the monks are going to<br>have like a ceremony so they set up to<br>Sea so is there SEMA the thean temple um<br>so they they set up and then they<br>destroy okay so temporary<br>temporary<br>um the RO offering ceremony so when they<br>are going to have<br>that ceremony or when they are going to<br>have a retreat they will consecrate the<br>SEMA within like a particular area and<br>then they would would do a they would<br>follow um the way to do it I think the M<br>will will shant or resite or something<br>like that and they they will consecrate<br>it put it in like the four<br>corner and then they would do like the<br>ceremony<br>within that area so it's considered as a<br>secret um and it's not for Lay people<br>it's the lay can can<br>enter okay but in some I think it's<br>mered to the cultural practice too yeah<br>that's also cultural practice um so in<br>in in nor in isan in in North East Tai<br>so wom are not allowed not allowed to<br>enter uh the SEMA the boundary uh but in<br>um Central Thailand so women are allowed<br>to that's<br>aestic yeah because in Sri Lanka there's<br>like Temple of Truth so when you go<br>there there's like SEMA Malak so women<br>are not allowed to enter so there's one<br>president who who like made Oaths as a<br>president in that Sema Mal with the wife<br>which was so<br>controversial it's a big deal it doesn't<br>sound important but it's a big deal no I<br>hope some of that will come out in the<br>discussion tomorrow so see these monks<br>in this picture one the one on the right<br>is and he wrote a book in the 1930s<br>about Simon and it was based on was a<br>summary of poly scriptures about Seas<br>and I I and my research assistant<br>translated that that booklet and it was<br>published um and<br>so<br>I I I'm don't know if you need to read<br>the translation which is part of your<br>reading packet but I think it might be<br>interesting to read the introduction<br>that I wrote that article and which<br>which Elizabeth contributed to as well<br>and um and so it was a lizabeth's<br>request that I talk about this and I'm<br>it's the one talk that I'm most nervous<br>about for various then do an article in<br>the book oh he does and I I I guess I<br>forgot uh<br>embarrassing think he does uh which we<br>we definitely should print out<br>okay maybe maybe I'm thinking another<br>one<br>but<br>what what I hope tomorrow is we can get<br>at least a better understanding what<br>semas are and you know they're what you<br>said but the thing is in in practice<br>they<br>have they they have social and political<br>implications they go beyond merely the<br>religious and in the specific Cambodian<br>context that<br>and<br>this this book publish of the 30s seems<br>sort of neutral it's just a t about<br>Buddhas SEMA as it's written about<br>Nepali but if you look at the context of<br>that booklet you can see that it came to<br>have certain implications um and that's<br>my own work is not so much about the<br>Vana about the rules of monthly Behavior<br>although that's very interesting and in<br>itself and some of you can I'm sure can<br>tell you things about tell me things<br>about that that I don't know but as it<br>relates to my work it's interesting<br>because it tells about certain<br>developments in Cambodian boosement a<br>certain period of time and so that's<br>what I hope you might get out of the<br>talk tomorrow and<br>um so I want to say it'll be shorter<br>tomorrow but it I can't promise anything<br>so so so sorry he didn't didn't write a<br>that Satur Satur has a<br>chapter has a chapter yeah sorry Ben's<br>got another chapter Ben has a lot of<br>chapters in a lot of<br>places sorry yeah<br>yeah<br>okay but the the new Buddhist groups I'm<br>like studying they don't have SEMA at<br>all I think they just don't and that's<br>quite interesting it's really<br>interesting too uh so do they have like<br>dealer do they set up Deery for not<br>really because they are not into like<br>rituals per se or disciplinary like vaka<br>they are not into vaka so they're saying<br>like Abid and like simple preaching and<br>how to attract more young people so they<br>are they are blurring the boundary<br>between Le and the monastic<br>communities<br>mess with that boring stuff just get to<br>the real<br>stuff that makes sense you<br>know but then you know if you start<br>looking at the poly Canon like that's a<br>p big big problem<br>um so where this like<br>Mahan like I mean the traditional one<br>they<br>can't fight on like they have different<br>see and they can't<br>perform sa rituals together splits of<br>their the Naya the Naya you have to be<br>ordained in the same system same<br>lineage yeah it's really interesting<br>yeah but because these groups don't have<br>ordination most of them have not<br>ordained so that's also interesting so<br>that means they don't lay movement this<br>is pretty much it's not lay movement<br>they're ro marks but still they have<br>like lay preaches also some of the<br>groups so that's like one monk he is not<br>he's not able to like make others or<br>because he's not OD monk but there are<br>there are a lot of lay preachers who's<br>like in the ground operating<br>individually independently but at the<br>same time connected to the<br>group and so they have their own lineage<br>within their movement yeah so they're<br>almost like starting in Naya yeah that's<br>what but it's not with this I don't know<br>rituals and traditions so and you know<br>and yeah the<br>same the same well it's different but<br>within Cambodia as well there<br>are there are movements within Cambodian<br>Buddhism that seem like they're mov in<br>the direction of creating<br>a new nikaya but then of course the the<br>authorities do not want the creation of<br>a new<br>n so<br>um<br>Ina yeah was it thesis like depending on<br>which you were ordained with you could<br>get an allowance from the government and<br>if you didn't have the right<br>ordination that you didn't get the ID<br>card and you couldn't get on the pension<br>list or it's like a big deal<br>yeah um so it's not just theoretical<br>it's about how you managed to survive as<br>SEMA seeo it'll be fun no anyway I I I<br>want you all to come prepared and give<br>me in input tomorrow I'm not I'm not out<br>saying you need well of course if you<br>could read it it's good but but I think<br>you all know about semas in your own<br>traditions and I would I do welcome your<br>input in<br>my fairly superficial understanding of<br>SE<br>myself I I think also like Hinduism also<br>have something<br>similar I think I'm not sure not because<br>I've done the<br>reading and I didn't recognize a<br>lot um yeah they didn't seem to be<br>anything that very few things came up<br>and I was like oh that's that's that<br>links<br>to Hinduism so but I I don't I don't<br>have a full answer for you but nothing<br>sort of not a lot came up that I was<br>familiar<br>with we used to we used to read is it<br>mer El we did religious studies in the<br>Dark Ages and he was all about Sacred<br>Space you know the Ed of Sacred Space<br>profane space so there's an element of<br>that in any religion like Aboriginal<br>Mari tapu<br>Noah but it seems<br>like the Naya<br>is the<br>um the vinia not the n the vinia is<br>absolutely neurotic about it like they<br>just take it to an extreme level of<br>anxiety yeah the<br>v j Ben's thing is bit is law<br>so that's why I was thinking he's<br>written other stuff about Sri<br>Lankan legal<br>systems yeah okay well<br>are are we still being record it yeah I<br>don't know how to stop<br>here says leave should we leave okay<br>okay</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
