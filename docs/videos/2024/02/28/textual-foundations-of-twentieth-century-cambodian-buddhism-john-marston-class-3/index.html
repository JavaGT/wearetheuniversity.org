anything or she got<br>it all set up I think it's already set<br>up right this is the point where I watch<br>have sounds familiar but was one of<br>people yesterday yeah yesterday and so<br>on<br>and yesterday we got it's pretty yeah<br>coming<br>so<br>M hello hello everybody hello everybody<br>yeah so do you want to just introduce<br>yourself I mean I've<br>gotten okay sure I'll start then and<br>um um I assume that the the screens are<br>the way there should be and<br>Angela well this is the third day in our<br>session of readings in Buddhist text I'm<br>John marsten I'm the visiting Professor<br>here at University of tago<br>and um<br>I'm as you know if you've attended the<br>earlier sessions I'm a professor at the<br>center for Asian African studies at okah<br>Mexico um and um I where I teach<br>Southeast Asian studies but um over the<br>years my field of research has primarily<br>been uh Buddhism in Cambodia and<br>so today I continue uh with um my<br>research and my topic today is about um<br>Cambodia the Asia<br>foundation and Cambodian monks in in<br>India uh like my first<br>my previous two talks this is uh<br>historical talk but but fairly recent<br>history um<br>the Cambodia and India in the 19 in<br>1950s and<br>1960s<br>um<br>so this um<br>topic actually I somehow I identified<br>the connection with the Asia Foundation<br>before this book came out but this is<br>sort of the key book in many ways um by<br>Eugene Ford Cold War monks Buddhism in<br>America's Secret strategy in Southeast<br>Asia and he talked about the Asia<br>Foundation uh the fact that it was<br>linked that it it it was basically a<br>covered Organization for the<br>CIA um and and its goal was to use<br>promote Buddhism as a way of as a line<br>of defense against communism and this<br>was very important in the early history<br>of the Asia Foundation the Asia<br>Foundation later shift its focus um<br>so early on when I began talking about<br>my own research in this I um I gave a<br>talk I'm I'm a professor in Mexico at<br>University of kma and the next day or<br>the next week there was an article in<br>the student newspaper saying CIA C CIA<br>supports Cambodian Buddhist monks<br>and in the<br>1950s and and in a way I was happy<br>because it sort of dramatized my<br>research uh and yet in a way that's a<br>distortion of my research because um as<br>you'll see that even though<br>this the Asia Foundation did ultimately<br>had this agenda of supporting Buddhism<br>in order to fight<br>communism um in some ways the fact that<br>this what I'm going to talk about was<br>ultimately funded by the ca is a little<br>bit irrelevant uh and what I'm<br>interested is in the social phenomenon<br>of this organization which the fact that<br>the C CIA well the CIA wasn't even that<br>well known as an entity I believe at<br>this time it became better known over<br>the course of the 50s and 1960s but the<br>people who worked for the Asia<br>Foundation the people who received<br>funding from the Asia Foundation didn't<br>really know about the CIA link but they<br>did know it was an American foundation<br>and they did know it was they didn't<br>know that the Americans were opposed to<br>Communism and so in a way that was<br>enough to know uh for them and maybe<br>it's enough to know for us and what I<br>would stress is that the kind of things<br>I'm talking about were not completely<br>bad um that I'm talking about<br>scholarships that were given to<br>Cambodian monks to go to India in the<br>1950s and 1960s and um that one may say<br>that these<br>were ins some ways a good thing but it<br>was a complex thing and so what I'd like<br>to talk about here is some of the some<br>of the social complexity of of what that<br>meant at the time um so<br>um uh My overall research and my current<br>research well if you attended the first<br>session I talked about a Cambodian monk<br>named dharmavaram mahat cambodians often<br>called called him by his his uh uh name<br>before he became a monk Bell uh and um<br>for now for quite some time now I've<br>been interested in uh Cambodian monks<br>who studied in India in the 1950s and<br>1960s there were I've now identified<br>like about 35 names and um and uh there<br>were various reasons I was attracted to<br>this topic and um now two of these monks<br>are quite famous and while my original<br>goal was to look at all of them and some<br>of my the chapters of my the book I'm<br>working on will look at all of them or<br>look at it more generally my research<br>has tended to focus on two monks who are<br>particularly famous one of the most<br>daravar mahat who I uh who I talked<br>about on Monday and the other one is a<br>monk named mahag goand now<br>um uh for today's talk<br>um today's talk is based on a<br>publication but a publication that<br>appeared only in Spanish so far uh but<br>it really draws<br>on so what I'm primarily going to<br>present is this um is the material in<br>this article that was published in<br>Spanish which I originally wrote in<br>English but was translated into Spanish<br>for the publication and I hope someday<br>it will be published in English um but<br>I'm drawing on as well another<br>publication which was in the reading<br>packet<br>about about Nava Nanda mahavihara which<br>was an Institute started in the 1950s in<br>India<br>which was one where mahag goand attended<br>and where a lot of monks from from a<br>number of country Buddhist countries<br>attended and had some special importance<br>at that<br>time uh and I'm also drawing as you will<br>see that Maho sonanda figures in my<br>paper but in a fairly minor way so but I<br>thought we might start by um<br>just talking a little bit about<br>mahananda and who he is and um before<br>starting the paper proper and so uh<br>these are uh mahag Sando was one of<br>three monks who went from Cambodia to<br>India in the 1950s about the time of<br>Cambodian Independence and they studied<br>at originally at Nava nand mahavihara<br>this this school that had only recently<br>opened uh and here is uh um I believe<br>he's on the figure of the right and of<br>the three monks um on the left hand<br>picture he's there's a picture of him in<br>his later life in the center picture and<br>then um just to think of his<br>significance that when I started my<br>research I was fascinated with Maho<br>Sanda<br>and and I had remembered when he was<br>still alive and when he did peace walks<br>in Cambodia and he always seemed<br>significant to me but at that time I<br>believed his his importance in Cambodia<br>was disappearing it seemed like it<br>seemed like uh cambodians I talked to<br>remembered him less and less and when I<br>started my research I think that was the<br>case although now when I talk to younger<br>Cambodian monks there there seems to be<br>renewed interest in mahako sonanda as<br>someone who as someone who uh who<br>represents uh he's historical figure who<br>represents what is most positive about<br>the Cambodian monkhood I believe at this<br>point and um so he's someone is a figure<br>a recent historical figure who<br>nevertheless has has a certain<br>prominence in in C the history of the<br>cam the recent history of the Cambodian<br>monkhood and who may become more<br>important as time goes by<br>um um he in a paper in a draft chapter<br>which I wrote um he I talk about his<br>early background his background in<br>Cambodia his family life what what<br>little we know about it how he studied<br>it what uh he how he was resident what<br>un he was there actually during World<br>War II at a time when us bombs hit the<br>temple which is which is in itself a<br>significant moment uh so I talk about<br>his intellectual influences which are<br>are part of what we'll be considering<br>here including his time at this school<br>Nava Nanda mahavihara which will which<br>some of that the intellectual life of<br>that will come out when we talk about uh<br>when we talk about um the Asia<br>foundation and its policies toward Nava<br>nand mahara he was also at that time he<br>was in India at the time that Edgar<br>Edgar was an important figure in in<br>Buddhist history in India he was a delit<br>he was um uh he was from what used to be<br>called an Untouchable cast and yet he<br>was he became one of the most important<br>political figures at the time of inde uh<br>at the time of Indian independence and<br>near the end of his life he he converted<br>to Buddhism and there was mass<br>conversion to Buddhism<br>uh among lower cast people at that time<br>and this influenced the intellectual<br>climate uh that then influence Maho<br>sonanda he was influenced by as well<br>by um uh by a Japanese monk who uh nid<br>datu Fuji who uh who promoted peace<br>movements in uh worldwide but especially<br>in India and Japan um he created a a<br>Pupa near in Raja gear which was close<br>to where mahag goand was living and and<br>by all accounts mahag<br>gananda um had a connection to this um<br>this Mahayana Buddhist movement uh uh in<br>the um nin Buddhist tradition which<br>which seemed very different than his<br>training as a ter Buddhist Mon and then<br>and then when he left<br>when he left India instead of going back<br>to Cambodia he spent time in a Thai um<br>and a Tha Forest tradition Monastery<br>which we see in this picture uh this is<br>an interesting picture because he's with<br>two two rather well-known Western<br>meditation teachers um uh Jack cornfield<br>and Christopher titmas are in this<br>picture this picture was posted on Jack<br>cornfields website um<br>and he was studying with um aan dadar in<br>the south of of Thailand and so he spent<br>a quite a long period of time of um from<br>the mid 70s until<br>um until the early 80s uh in in forest<br>in Med at a meditation W in southern<br>Thailand um so just to give you an idea<br>that who uh<br>who Maho Sando was because among other<br>things my research into this topic<br>of of um the Asia foundation and its<br>sponsorship of Cambo monks it started<br>out with my interest in trying to<br>understand Maho Sanda and so I will in<br>the course of my paper I'll be talking<br>more about Nava Nanda mahavihara what at<br>that time it was informly called Nanda<br>University and now there's another Nanda<br>University and this is something I have<br>published about um but I think I will<br>just oh and here's a picture of Maho<br>Sanda um in the early 90s he led a<br>series of Peace walks um uh the first<br>one was from the border areas of the<br>refugee camps and border camps and and<br>he took a a group of monks and nuns and<br>lay person who who performed a peace<br>walk from from the border to plumin and<br>over several years he led several peace<br>walks of this kind and this is what he's<br>perhaps most fam which he's most famous<br>for uh although he has other reasons for<br>having significance as well uh so just<br>jumping forward in my PowerPoint um<br>because and as I go further in my talk<br>we'll be talking more about why<br>how naand mahavar was was a bit<br>controversial but I just to introduce<br>this idea at the very beginning and<br>Navan Alanda mahavar was formed in the<br>early 50s by a monk named he's an Indian<br>monk his name is um uh H H um uh I pron<br>I always pronounce it wrong jagadesh<br>kasapa I used to say jages kasapa now I<br>I'm told I've been pronouncing it wrong<br>all this time and jish kipa was an was<br>Indian and um from from I believe from<br>bear uh state in India um he for various<br>reasons he got involved in interested in<br>terada Buddhism he ordained as a monk in<br>Sri Lanka um and then he came back to<br>India and he was an important Buddhist<br>scholar uh and um and<br>he<br>was uh later on I'll talk about some of<br>the things he did which make<br>him which were questioned by the Asia<br>Foundation but perhaps now when people<br>look back at him and this relates to<br>some things we were talking about<br>yesterday that he's uh his perhaps<br>Premier achievement was that and he he<br>end up retiring as a founder of he<br>founded this naand mahavihara and then<br>he later on left for per of time to work<br>on his um edition of the of the poly of<br>the traptic a 40 volume uh edition of<br>trtica and Dav Airi uh script and and<br>actually this was the first time there<br>was uh a complete edition of the of the<br>um chpa and davir script which is if you<br>go to naand mahavihara they say you know<br>this was a a major achievement and they<br>say this is they talk about it is perhap<br>as one of the most important additions<br>of the trtica uh which has since been<br>expanded into into even an addition with<br>more annotation and uh and even more<br>volumes um so um uh just to note in this<br>picture as well the the architecture the<br>architecture was uh when this University<br>was built in the 1950s it was was very<br>modern you can see it's it it it has<br>this kind of claim to modernity at the<br>same time there all these motifs of<br>stupa stupa architecture um uh which<br>were was a kind of Buddhist modernity<br>let's say of its of its time uh which uh<br>um<br>and um and in this picture on the right<br>you see he had a collection of Buddhist<br>manuscripts from all over the world from<br>China Burma Cambodia um and when I<br>recently visited University<br>for uh for the second time and and was<br>able to visit this manuscript room which<br>they were very proud of and um and all<br>these manuscripts were collected by<br>jagadish K kup in the 19 while he was<br>alive at probably in the 1950s and 1960s<br>and so just as an Indulgence um because<br>I was trying to see if I could this was<br>when I visited there recently um the<br>codian student who studying there um<br>took this little video of me and this<br>doesn't particularly relate to my<br>research but I'll play this video partly<br>because I was trying to figure out how<br>to put this Del of this video and<br>Elizabeth very kindly um helped me and<br>uh so let's just play it and this is<br>the the librarian talking about oh you<br>don't have sound I guess I don't have<br>sound so anyway so much for that but um<br>you can see it's palm leaf it's actually<br>not palm leaf but mostly yeah they had<br>pal me manp but this was exceptional it<br>was that banana there were slices of ban<br>kind of banana stem family sight and uh<br>and there was a Cambodian manuscript but<br>they had various types of of manuscript<br>there um uh anyway this just to give you<br>an idea of what naand mahavihara<br>uh represented and represents at the<br>present time it it's still um there<br>there other universities in in India<br>that have Buddhist studies and this one<br>uh has its own peculiarities and is very<br>text oriented um it's possible that uh<br>some of you might find it helpful to go<br>there and consult their collection at<br>some point um and uh so okay but let's<br>go back uh and if I can figure out how<br>to go<br>back<br>uh and<br>well uh one more thing that that relates<br>to uh this series of talks as a whole is<br>that and as I said in the first two<br>talks that I'm I don't consider myself<br>particularly a textual scholar and yet<br>each of these talks will will have some<br>key texts um and so in this case what<br>you those of you who have the the<br>readings packet and um well notice at<br>the end there is a letter written by a<br>Cambodian<br>student uh who had negative experiences<br>with the Asia Foundation as you'll see<br>and he originally wrote his letter in my<br>as sort of as a protest rather than<br>writing the letter in English and the<br>letter was for some reason translated<br>into French so what we have is a French<br>a French letter which then I've<br>translated<br>uh in passages into English um and so<br>keep in mind that in if our goal in this<br>lecture series to look at Buddhist text<br>then in this research which I'm doing is<br>largely drawn on archives from the Asia<br>Foundation which is uh which is at<br>Stanford University and the and the<br>Hoover Institute<br>um uh and most of these are rather dry<br>memos Al although it's amazing how often<br>these little dry memos have little bits<br>of drama in them which is what I'm<br>attracted to and this letter of by the<br>student<br>somehow uh was at another level it<br>seemed to be very personal and yet<br>relate to some of the larger issues of<br>Buddhism in relationship politics and<br>culture that I'm concerned here so keep<br>in mind that as I as I go through my<br>paper that um perhaps this letter at the<br>end will be sort of<br>the um the culmination of this and so I<br>I do think this is ultimately is a paper<br>relating to issues of of text so<br>um<br>um so as I say and I'll here I begin my<br>my paper proper<br>uh so<br>um<br>uh<br>um and just to say what I said before uh<br>this we start with thinking about the<br>fact that the Asia Foundation was did<br>have this connection to the US<br>government and and and was funded by the<br>ca uh CIA<br>um and its ultimate goal was to show up<br>the religion as a bulwark against<br>communism uh in practice this meant<br>funding projects intended to consolidate<br>Buddhist institutions at local and<br>Regional levels this was development Aid<br>that these institutions saw as serving<br>their own goals the the the kind of<br>things the age of foundation were not<br>particularly<br>Sinister<br>um among other things it work to<br>strengthen International Buddhist<br>Network such as through the growth of<br>the world Fellowship of<br>Buddhists these Asia Foundation<br>activities were not precisely secret<br>even though the direct connection to the<br>US government was by using the Asia<br>foundation of the US avoided the<br>appearance of direct involvement in the<br>religious Affairs of other<br>countries many Asia foundation employs<br>and we assume most of its funding<br>recipients were unaware of a CIA<br>link but my focus here is on a small<br>window and in this process the Asia<br>Foundation funding of Cambodian monks<br>studying in India my as I say my purpose<br>is not to unmask a Sinister plot but to<br>look at what it meant in human terms so<br>the monks involved these were border<br>crosses making their way at the<br>intersection of various political and<br>cultural<br>worlds and how this contributes to our<br>understanding of the history of<br>Cambodian<br>Buddhism again as in my first talk there<br>there is a cold war Dimension to all of<br>this but I'd admit that it's a subtle<br>one the Asia Foundation that emerges<br>from the study is not a unified front it<br>grow sometimes in inconsistent ways in<br>its attempt to deal with culture and<br>politics uh if what I describe is<br>informed by a discourse of Cold War<br>Buddhism or a set of such discourses and<br>is shaped by larger relations of power<br>we must also recognize<br>a constant give and take as was put into<br>practice so this again relates to my<br>first talk and that what I'm interested<br>in is looking at individual players<br>individual people as they are sort of<br>negotiating their way in relationship to<br>these larger processes which we can<br>associate with with the Cold War and<br>with other Buddhist<br>movements um we're talking about<br>approximately 15 monkss going to India<br>1965 more Cambodian monks went later<br>they were funded initially through the<br>two principal Cambodian Buddhist<br>associations and then in the early 60s<br>were scholarships given by the Asia<br>Foundation while my research emphasized<br>monks going to India the the number<br>involved increases if we include Asia<br>Foundation funding of Cambodian monks<br>going to Thailand Sri Lanka and Burma in<br>the same<br>period for example in 1959 the Asia<br>Foundation was funding 12 Cambodian<br>student<br>monks only five of them in India a 1961<br>list had<br>nine Asia Foundation funded monks in<br>India two in Sri Lanka and none in<br>Thailand or Burma scholarships to<br>Thailand were important in the early<br>days in a 1954 Accord for clerical<br>education between Thailand and LA in<br>Cambodia preceded the period of Asia<br>Foundation<br>funding sending Cambodian monks to<br>Thailand ended early in N November 1958<br>however because of diplomatic tensions<br>between the two countries Cambodian<br>monks returned at that<br>time in a 1959 report Richard guard<br>recommended inding scholarships to Burma<br>because he wrote its education system<br>for monks was so similar to what was<br>available ppin in Bangkok and the this<br>recommendation was apparently<br>implemented um the number of<br>scholarships to Sri Lanka remained small<br>some monks who went to other countries<br>would then go for further education in<br>India India was in any case always<br>considered the most appropriate<br>destination for studies beyond the<br>bachelor's level there were also<br>significant numbers of students monks<br>from Thailand allows going to India and<br>this period and this is something that I<br>would love to has see other people do<br>research on<br>um um some were founded funded by the<br>Asia Foundation I do not have precise<br>data on this I think as I've talked to<br>people that it was the percentage who<br>were po who were funded by the Asia<br>Foundation was perhaps smaller than in<br>Cambodia as I said my larger project<br>centers on two Cambodia monks were also<br>in India at this time dharmar mahat and<br>mahananda although dharmar was<br>peripheral to what I discuss<br>here uh he was already well established<br>in India when the student monks came he<br>would have been well known to the<br>younger monks who sometimes stay at his<br>temple on the outskirts of<br>Delhi mahag goand did receive some Asia<br>Foundation funding early in his studies<br>in India although the Cambodia po<br>Association through the Cambodia poly<br>Association but he figures in our<br>narrative not not so much for the<br>funding he received as for the fact that<br>it was later<br>denied consequently most of his time in<br>India was with government of India<br>scholarships it is significant in any<br>case to see him as a contemporary of the<br>monks with Asia Foundation funding they<br>would have known each other and they all<br>together with dharmar participated in a<br>historical moment in which a new<br>internalization of Buddhism flourish<br>while several Buddhist countries<br>including Cambodia celebrated the<br>greater cultural sovereignty the recent<br>Independence would would<br>represent the student monks we are<br>interested would have to come to have<br>varying degrees of name recognition<br>cambodians in the period from 1960s to<br>the<br>1980s what we're talking about is not<br>just monks but also men who after<br>leaving the monkhood maintain tied to<br>each other and Cambodian Buddhist<br>institutions Chim<br>p uh maybe we can go back<br>to this<br>P<br>um chimp Pon and<br>N uh eventually after leaving the monk<br>Hood became announcers for Voice of<br>America which given the importance Voice<br>of America was to have in Cambodia<br>represented a kind of celebrity based in<br>Washington DC and on the board of the<br>Cambodian temple in DC area they were<br>instrumental in bringing to the US a<br>monk who had also studied in India with<br>Asia Foundation<br>inan then pursuing a doctorate in Great<br>Britain uman would turn the temple and<br>Silver Springs Maryland into one of the<br>most prominent Camp temples in the<br>United States and was well known to<br>cambodians throughout the US in the<br>1980s as part of the funding agreement<br>many scholarship recipients were signed<br>documents committed to teach at the<br>Buddhist University on returning to<br>Cambodia and some remained as faculty<br>there permanently either as monks or<br>laymen da an who remained in the<br>monkhood was considered the best<br>Cambodian Sanskrit of his generation<br>gonu became the director of the Buddhist<br>lay samis Layman went on to teach at the<br>plumin University leim Long who<br>completed a doctorate in India became a<br>dean there his master's thesis on anoran<br>architecture was published as a book by<br>berar Hindu University K Lang talked at<br>the Buddhist University and pleaded a<br>master's degree in the US he published<br>books and a in the<br>1970s a series of short volumes on<br>Civics and political science and after a<br>few months as a deputy secretary of<br>state a book about corruption in the<br>Ministry of Education which was banned<br>in<br>1974 her attorneys from India would have<br>been among the best speakers of English<br>in Cambodia in the<br>1960s and promoting English was another<br>of the Asia Foundation State<br>goals<br>um<br>under the name of committee for free<br>Asia the Asia Foundation began working<br>in Burman<br>1952 where it developed good relations<br>with unu and then extended to Sri Lanka<br>and Thailand in<br>1954 at the time it began calling itself<br>the Asia Foundation Robert Bloom the<br>Asia Foundation president came to<br>Cambodia to arrange setting up an office<br>in November 19<br>1954 and its director arrived in March<br>1955 the country had just become<br>independent it would open an office in<br>1959 um the Asia Foundation director in<br>Cambodia Leonard Overton a World War II<br>veteran in the 1949 graduate of Trinity<br>College in Connecticut had gone to LA<br>with the state Department's office of<br>information education exchange by 1951<br>52 he was in plumen arguably with the<br>probably with the same agency and taught<br>English at wat unal one reason he was<br>perhaps in tune to the Cambodian<br>monkhood by the early 1960s according to<br>the oral history interview of a US<br>diplomatic station in Cambodia Overton<br>in his Asia Foundation role knew<br>everyone and was on good terms with<br>C COK the um who who in<br>uh at that time was the head of state uh<br>he had abdicated as king Cambodia after<br>Independence very quickly assumed the<br>position of neutrality as we saw we saw<br>on Monday espousing principles<br>annunciated by neru in the position<br>taken by the Bandung conference which<br>cuk and actually daravar mahat attended<br>it was open to us Aid in the 1950s<br>although it tried to counterbalance<br>usaid with aid from communist block<br>countries uh likewise tried to balance<br>trips to us Allied countries with trips<br>to countries and the Socialist<br>block uh his flirtation with the<br>socialist countries and for example<br>cambodia's diplomatic recognition of<br>China in 1958 made the United States<br>nervous the Asia Foundation was still<br>confident in the 1950s that COK was not<br>moving in the direction of Communism but<br>played a delicate<br>role uh at role in the country Overton<br>quoted in<br>a in an Asia Foundation monthly report<br>in 1956 showed his sensitivity to the<br>nuances of C<br>Exposition the creation of the Asia<br>Foundation Cambodia corresponded toat<br>with us diplomatic measures and with us<br>United States information service<br>invitation to Key Buddhist figures to<br>visit the United States these were not<br>Asia Foundation trips but there was<br>coordination with the Asia Foundation in<br>organizing the trip such as giving the<br>Asia Foundation responsibility for<br>entertaining guests when they were in<br>San Francisco near the Asia Foundation<br>headquarters as we saw on Monday daravar<br>mahat was the first to go to the United<br>States in 1955 and<br>1956 more significant for the<br>scholarship program was a trip the<br>following year by<br>Hut the second Ray Keen Mahan Kai Monk<br>and inspector of Cambodian monastic<br>education who we've also talked about he<br>had already the previous year received<br>Asia Foundation funding to visit<br>Buddhist educational institutions in<br>Thailand mon scholarships were<br>selected by an independent Cambodian<br>commission which did not include whoat<br>or the Mahan patri junat but it's clear<br>from Asia Foundation memos that they had<br>much interaction with him on the<br>scholarships over the years in 1957 Sam<br>Nan president of the World Federation of<br>Buddhist Cambodia and who was the father<br>of samere an important Cambodian<br>political<br>figure made a similar USIS us<br>information service sponsor trip to the<br>United States he was described in memos<br>as a good friend of the Asia Foundation<br>um the Asia Foundation began giving<br>support early on to two large the two<br>largest L Buddhist<br>organizations Association de amid de the<br>P called in English the Cambodian P<br>Association it later preferred the name<br>MIT V or<br>friends of the Buddhist L and the<br>Cambodian chapter of the world<br>Fellowship of<br>Buddhist the Cambodian poly Association<br>dates in 1949 and the Cambodian chapter<br>of the world F Fellowship Buddhist in<br>1952 when malisi visited Cambodia so<br>both were new organizations at this time<br>and in contrast to the historical<br>importance of L organizations Burma and<br>Sri Lanka the very concept of a lay<br>Buddhist Association was new to<br>Cambodia initial support for the two<br>organizations was for publication and<br>the purposes of office equipment both<br>associations listed among their<br>principal goals from the beginning the<br>support of Cambodian monks going to<br>study in foreign countries this related<br>in part to the plans for the creation of<br>a Buddhist University which was still in<br>planning stages when the Asia Foundation<br>first came to<br>Cambodia the monst chosen were former<br>students of the Buddhist lay and later<br>the Buddhist<br>University like most Cambodian monks<br>they typically had rural<br>backgrounds<br>um almost all had been residents at wat<br>unol or wat Lanka during studies in pen<br>the first group of monks sent to India<br>by the friends of the poly Association<br>1956 were the monks we see in this<br>picture uh Maho Sanda who uh was known<br>then by his name<br>bav miton who would later be a voice of<br>America announcer and amuan they all<br>went to study at nalanda uh a group of<br>Cambodian monks and NS had gone to Burma<br>for study in<br>1954 in conjunction with a two-year<br>process leading to the six Buddhist<br>Council others were in<br>Thailand we know that when the Asia<br>Foundation began supporting Cambodian<br>monks to the world Fellowship of<br>Buddhist Cambodia they contribute to<br>support for monks already resident in<br>Sri Lanka Burman<br>India<br>um we don't know the exact circumstance<br>was brought the<br>mon although the Asia Foundation had<br>several projects in India the Indian<br>government resisted giving permission to<br>set up the there for several years until<br>1961 scholarship funding was<br>administered through the Cambodian<br>Embassy opening up of Asia Foundation<br>offices in India gave the Asia<br>Foundation more capacity to check on<br>recipients or on occasion administer its<br>own scholarships without going through<br>organizations so our talk is divided<br>into three sections uh first is what the<br>documentary evidence shows about how the<br>Asia Foundation thought about its own<br>project of sending Cambodian monks to<br>India the second part will be about the<br>degree which we find evidence of Cold<br>War anti-communism in these documents<br>and the third part which is most<br>cultural is<br>about uh the Asia Foundation response to<br>Cambodian monks in India who chose to<br>leave the monkhood um and how this<br>became more complicated than one I<br>expect<br>um oh okay and I'm behind in my here<br>here are publications of the two the two<br>Cambodian lay organizations that<br>initially the Asia Foundation gave money<br>to these organizations which who in turn<br>who in turn use this money to<br>fund Cambodian monks studying in India<br>later on some Asia Foundation money was<br>given directly to the monks um they also<br>bought printing presses right they paper<br>yeah they they they had they were<br>funding various things for this<br>organization uh uh here here's just an<br>example of a a letter head from the Asia<br>Foundation this is the kind in my own<br>research I was dealing with in the<br>archives uh at Stanford University with<br>with this kind of of memo<br>uh<br>uh the Asia Foundation files on the<br>student monks tend to be about kinds of<br>things the administration of any<br>scholarship funded fun F on contracts<br>with<br>recipients the logistics that Prov<br>providing funds and addressing crises<br>when funds did not arrive or appeared<br>insufficient and attempts to monitor the<br>academic performance of of<br>recipients<br>um over the years 1955 to 65 we see<br>repeated commentary on the program of<br>scholarship for monks often in reports<br>by Richard guard a scholarship of<br>Buddhism based at Yale who was a<br>consultant to the Asia<br>Foundation uh for the years 1956 to<br>1963 and and here is<br>um I believe the picture on the left is<br>Richard Overton and the pictures on the<br>right are both pictures of of of Richard<br>guard um that's Everton on the left<br>yes and guard by the way is an important<br>figure in the book by Eugene Ford which<br>I showed at the beginning of the<br>these reports and memos underlined for<br>us the degree of internal debate about<br>what the scholarship meant and whether<br>they should be continued as early as<br>1956 before the Asia Foundation began<br>funding scholarships we see guard<br>writing about the need for monst to<br>Cambodia<br>um the training of Buddhist teachers for<br>the University budik and therefore for<br>the L budik and in turn the Buddhist<br>primary schools is a fundamental need<br>deserving the foundation's further<br>consideration they cannot be very well<br>trained in Cambodia and the possibility<br>exists that the Chinese Communists and<br>other Communists may offer to train them<br>in modern secular subjects Elsewhere for<br>in spite of Wishful Thinking by some<br>Americans the Chinese and Russian<br>Communists have not abandoned serious<br>studies of Buddhist doctrines and<br>practice for ideological exploitation so<br>uh so you can see that the motivation<br>was um was from the beginning uh<br>competition with the Chinese and the<br>Russians and uh and but there was also<br>motivation to anticipation of the<br>creation of a Buddhist<br>University and the need to have<br>Cambodian monks who were trained and<br>able to teach at the Buddhist<br>University although guards saw the need<br>for Cambodia to study outside of<br>Cambodia he never warmed to the idea of<br>them studying in India he felt that Sri<br>Lanka could potentially become a good<br>destination he hoped that Cambodian<br>monastics would eventually have a level<br>of training where they could study in<br>Japan the prospect of Cambodian monk<br>study in the US was also weighed<br>although he was skeptical that any would<br>be qualified academically in the near<br>future<br>um the Asia Foundation was aware of the<br>limitations of their agreements with the<br>Duke Cambodian layup Buddhist<br>organizations we find some grumbling<br>about the way the arrangements work<br>their contributions were intended to be<br>only part of the financial support<br>students received in the case of the<br>Cambodian poly Association when they<br>tried to limit their contribution only<br>to students's academic performance they<br>felt merited support the association<br>used its portion of the contribution to<br>continue supporting students the Asia<br>Foundation did not feel oberved it in<br>the case of the world Fellowship of<br>Buddhist Cambodia tended to let the Asia<br>Foundation assume the burden of<br>scholarship support so it could use its<br>own money for a building fund all this<br>was no doubt a factor when in the early<br>1960s the Asia Foundation began<br>experimenting with funding monks<br>directly which it previously funded<br>through the two organizations there's<br>mention in memos of world Fellowship of<br>Buddhist Cambodia protesting this the<br>Asia Foundation also began funding some<br>newer scholar ship receptions<br>directly but they never stopped<br>supporting some students through the<br>through through the two<br>organizations um Richard guard tended to<br>be a harsh critic however his viice was<br>often<br>ignored he<br>perceived he's perceptive if un<br>sympathetic in his description of what<br>the scholarships may have meant to the<br>monks<br>involved<br>um<br>um the desire desire and need for study<br>abroad by Buddhist monks should not be<br>confused by either s or foundation for<br>the desire need and program for<br>increased intra Asian Buddhist relations<br>through conferences and certain<br>visitations historically Buddhist monks<br>are Wanderers in international Travelers<br>the present day Buddhist student monk<br>feels himself a part of this tradition<br>and is attracted by international events<br>by the example of increasing air travel<br>by Layman and by the opportunities now<br>afforded him by friendly foreign<br>organizations whether the Asia<br>Foundation or the peaking government<br>constantly I suspect that the in<br>desired and here is where the quote<br>appears on the screen I suspect that<br>they expressed desire and need for study<br>abroad by monks applying to the<br>foundation for assistance is often<br>actually an urge to<br>travel after the beus have seen the<br>outside world which is C<br>customarily uh denied to them at home<br>they find it difficult to return to the<br>monastic life when they come back hence<br>my real question is how much educational<br>accomplishment for the<br>sua to serve itself in Lay society as<br>the foundation affecting through present<br>travel scholarship grants to the tervada<br>monks the program cannot be justified<br>upon the grounds that study abroad at<br>least broaden the perspective of the<br>student monk Fosters better intra Asian<br>Buddhist relations and understanding or<br>the not All Is Lost even if the monk<br>returns to lay life afterwards these<br>side benefits can be achieved more<br>directly and economically through other<br>programs such as intra-asian Buddhist<br>conferences<br>um guard's position in general was that<br>instead of study abroad monks could be<br>better trained by increased cooperation<br>with secular educational Institutions<br>and their own countries International<br>connections could be better promoted by<br>participation in international seminars<br>and conferences than by by Foreign<br>schooling the Asia Foundation however<br>did not follow chose not to follow<br>um um I quote even if the measures<br>suggested by dick guard are put into<br>effect there will still be a lack of<br>educated trained leadership in the<br>Cambodian<br>s admitting the force of guard's<br>criticism training abroad is still a<br>necessary expedient to make<br>possible the further development of<br>Buddhist education<br>Cambodia the Asia Foundation was aware<br>of the pro problematic of having<br>Buddhist monks study in India primarily<br>a Hindu country guard wrote in another<br>report<br>um most Indian Scholars of Buddhism are<br>Hindu in belief and approach with a<br>consequent non- Buddhist understanding<br>of Buddhism in my opinion they are not<br>qualified to teach Buddhist monks about<br>Buddhism but would be helpful in guiding<br>research on the doctrinal and historical<br>relations between Buddhism and Hinduism<br>for those<br>Buddhism uh Buddhist monks already well<br>advanced in both Buddhist studies and<br>modern critical methods of analysis I<br>doubt whether Buddhist and Hindu studies<br>are well correlated in Indian<br>education and this perspective and thus<br>prospective teachers at the University<br>bti need most in addition to training in<br>modern scholarships<br>um uh these are issues that uh continue<br>to form the um the situation of cambod<br>mon studying in India now but despite<br>all this the scholarship program<br>continued in<br>1962 Memo by Leonard Overton to the Asia<br>Foundation representative is also<br>revealing he seems to be responding with<br>some<br>frustration um to to a complaint by the<br>asan Foundation office in India about<br>the caliber of a candidate they were<br>proposing for studying in India he<br>States the first Cambodian monks who<br>finished studies in India we already<br>making a positive contribution in<br>Cambodia but in other ways he's<br>defensive<br>um<br>uh uh and I'll read the longer quotation<br>which we see the last part on the<br>screen quote however the question of<br>abilities qualification said will<br>undoubtedly present itself again next<br>year when we will submit the names of<br>another group of student monks we'll<br>certainly attempt to get the best<br>candidates that we can this is the basis<br>of our entire scholarship program<br>however we have no illusions that next<br>year's crop will be substantially better<br>than this year's the candidates we<br>selected this year were all in the top<br>half of their class at the university<br>the most advanced Buddhist educational<br>institution in the land of course the<br>problems that even these students are<br>seldom Top Flight in our Western terms<br>of reference they are merely the best<br>available and um to be perfectly Frank<br>the only reason that we have sent and<br>will continue to send monst to India for<br>study is that it is about the only<br>country where they can get into a<br>university and completed degree degree<br>program while the standards in India are<br>higher than here they're still gener<br>generally low this is why we are not as<br>certain as you that nun is quote<br>virtually incapable of obtaining degree<br>others in the past with only slightly<br>better records here have done so a and<br>when I read this I want to emphasize<br>that I'm not approving of what he's<br>saying that there's there's a<br>condescension here that this is someone<br>this is an American who feels confident<br>in the superiority of himself and his<br>education system and the in fact on the<br>ground we see something more complicated<br>and monks Cambodia monks studying in IND<br>India were able in many contexts to get<br>a good education and many of them were<br>in the context of their own background<br>very qualified as we see in their later<br>careers in Cambodia<br>um so this seems like a place to take a<br>break should we take a a short break now<br>um as there any does anyone want to<br>start to make comments now before we<br>is that I'm just curious like is<br>this racism or just superiority do you<br>think sorry we're having a racist racism<br>discussion this morning so it's on my<br>mind well I I think there is some racism<br>there and but it's also true that<br>um I I I mean it is true that India is a<br>Hindu country not Buddhist country and I<br>I do think and guard was arguing that<br>they would be better off in Sri Lanka<br>and I think that that probably was true<br>so Pro Sri Lanka guard was PR Pro Sri<br>Lanka although he he thought maybe not<br>right away but eventually and and it's<br>also true that the Cambodian monastic<br>education system was still weak at this<br>point it was a high school was a poly<br>High School High School uh so Buddhist<br>when is it Buddhist University the<br>Buddhist University is opened about this<br>time it it I I think by the by the end<br>of the 50s the Buddhist University had<br>start but the first monks came like Maho<br>Sanda were going to<br>India when there was no uni Buddhist<br>University and so when they came back<br>they were among the first professors at<br>the Buddhist<br>University and and so there's there is a<br>grain of Truth here at the same time<br>you know clearly uh overend and guard<br>would say the best place to study<br>Buddhism would be the United States<br>which is which is probably not the case<br>uh and and there's certain attitude<br>toward which was condescending toward<br>Asian institutions and uh that perhaps<br>did not<br>recognize uh that the Traditions the<br>scholarly Traditions that really did<br>exist in in India at that time which may<br>have oriented themselves in different<br>ways than say a study in Budd a program<br>in Buddhist studies would have oriented<br>in the United<br>States um some of these monks really uh<br>were not successful they that they they<br>barely some of them I think did<br>not did not pass their courses they did<br>not the Cambodian monks were studying in<br>India at the<br>beginning I think at least some of them<br>did not do that well in the University<br>although some of them did some of them<br>would go on to be among the most<br>important Buddhist scholars in Cambodia<br>of their time<br>so you<br>so do they did they use<br>English yes they they did do they had to<br>do everything in English they they were<br>studying in English and so among other<br>thing actually this is part of the goal<br>of the Asia Foundation that these<br>students would come back and would speak<br>English and and so among other things<br>like<br>um uh like some of them<br>became left the monkhood and became<br>English professors of English and or<br>translators of English and in Cambodia<br>which was at that time it was that had a<br>background of French colonialism so<br>English was not widely spoken in<br>Cambodia at this time so the the monks<br>who studied<br>English who studied in India when they<br>came back<br>they they were among the best speakers<br>Cambodia question I think oh is someone<br>raise the<br>hand okay yeah yeah I got a question if<br>if you don't<br>mind um I find it a very interesting one<br>I read the text it so much information<br>and thank you so much um my question is<br>the I I was wondering how uh the Asia<br>Foundation because their work is to<br>support the Buddhist man to get<br>education in India yeah but to me I find<br>it uh I think they sound more negative<br>personis toward the buh I don't know<br>maybe just a feeling do do you know the<br>reason why well I I think there H<br>there's whether we want to call it<br>racism or colonialism there there was<br>that element and and they had as we know<br>their their main goal was really um<br>fighting communism and and but they<br>decided that they were that one way of<br>fighting communism was to make Buddhism<br>stronger and<br>so I they I think from the perspective<br>of Buddhist we can say they they did<br>some positive things at building<br>up helping to build up uh Cambodian<br>Buddhism and International Buddhist<br>organization like World Fellowship of<br>Buddhists at this time um at the same<br>time we do see this condescension and<br>which is kind of uh which can be kind of<br>irritating uh and and you should be<br>critical of that um and but that's part<br>of the<br>whole<br>uh well the time the time of the time I<br>mean this was post World War II was post<br>World War II was postc<br>colonial I mean the United States was<br>not uh did not colonize Cambodia but the<br>United States in its role in<br>relationship to the countries of Asia<br>had something of a what we could call a<br>colonial mentality and we still see<br>these attitudes uh which which I think<br>it's correct to call Colonial attitudes<br>at this<br>you okay well let's just take a a a a<br>then<br>there's a a number of<br>Scholars if you're interested in<br>this the Asia Foundation there's a<br>number of Scholars that are working on<br>that right<br>now they were active in Tibet and<br>in so there's like you can find Scholars<br>that are working on the foundation and<br>into that and they obviously they were<br>very wored up about<br>Japan in the apathic World War<br>II yeah so that book by Ford is pretty<br>cool so the the first world Fellowship<br>that is Inaugural conference happened in<br>Columbo and Candi the second one<br>happened in h hirosima so that was a<br>signal to the Asia Foundation that they<br>had to be there and make sure Japanese<br>Wen rising from the ashes you know so<br>they filmed the whole thing so it's a<br>black and white film of this wfp<br>conference hirosima<br>so fascinating<br>yeah with the sort of<br>American guys looking like CIA agents<br>walking around going what's going on<br>what's going<br>on Japanese are<br>gonna B trouble we know it and of course<br>the bit were trying to emphasize<br>peace you know neutrality and the<br>Kashima yeah the Americans are going we<br>won the Japanese are going where's the<br>compassion where's the mattera I'm<br>do I me yeah can't forget about contable<br>this did did their<br>influence um inbet that must have like<br>drained a little bit well they supported<br>the fre Freedom Fighters in Tibet there<br>were Freedom Fighters fighting the<br>Chinese and obviously they lost and they<br>end up in the refugee camps in India and<br>there's been some research on these<br>former Freedom<br>role<br>um yeah somebody has spread a thesis on<br>like she went around and interviewed<br>these former Freedom Fighters and how<br>they were um progressively<br>dist from the do Lama with the attempt<br>to westernize the doly Lama<br>and make it<br>possible it's sort of the soft culture<br>thing to the Western World so they're<br>trying to isolate these former Freedom<br>Fighters and they don't have any money<br>and they don't have any influence but<br>this woman went in and got all the<br>stories about how they got funding and<br>weapons<br>from Shoot the chines and you know<br>so so of gives you inside what's<br>example these things are<br>just you know there's constant<br>interference political interference and<br>religious activities Buddhism I mean you<br>think Buddism does political<br>well and<br>uh yeah any kind of f has some kind of<br>it's not<br>nothing's<br>free not<br>as so I'm not saying they're bad and<br>they're good I'm<br>just so keep<br>context and just this whole thing of<br>giving printing presses to Buddhist and<br>letting them print journals like that's<br>pretty and these journals are amazing<br>sources historical sources we've got um<br>I think when the funding ran out those<br>jour Journal stopped so it's like you<br>know have these beautiful journals color<br>printing and<br>then they're not going<br>world that that book by Eugene F this<br>say PhD thesis and then his book it's<br>really<br>good was a PhD thesis at um was he<br>um but of course he doesn't have<br>religious studies<br>misses yeah I think and<br>Ford interesting thing he did not go<br>into uh<br>uh he did not go into Academia he's<br>working in well Fred's working for the<br>CIA yeah yeah and you can't get a hold<br>of this documents<br>besides what is<br>the Central Central Intelligence Agency<br>of<br>America so it's like spy yeah the SP yes<br>the basically us and the primary<br>American uh Intelligence Agency for<br>intelligence overseas and that's<br>why the CIA has<br>uh you<br>know done a lot of things over the years<br>and some of them are have been<br>questionable and uh especially<br>in Southeast Asia<br>well those of us who are interested in<br>Southeast Asia are very aware of the<br>role of of the<br>CIA at the time of the Vietnam War now<br>the CIA has done a lot of things over<br>the years and some of it is merely<br>collecting information and uh in the 60s<br>the CIA tended to be more<br>interventionist than perhaps it was<br>later later on they there was an attempt<br>to curtail the invent Interventional<br>nature of this Central Intelligence<br>Agency so it's not my purpose to talk<br>about the CIA so much and when you talk<br>about the ca CIA Things become very<br>emotional because uh people often have<br>especially I I teach in Mexico and so<br>definitely in in Mexico When you mention<br>the CIA it's there's<br>this image of Big Brother inter<br>intervening in the world and and at<br>different historical moments that has<br>been the case<br>and uh<br>exactly but the CIA is dramatic also<br>because there's a lot of um movies about<br>spies and<br>sometimes uh and novels spy novels and<br>sometimes dramatic dramatizing them in<br>ways are which are more dramatic than<br>the actual fact and<br>uh uh and<br>so one reason<br>I I like to give this paper is because<br>people pay attention when I mention CIA<br>and so maybe some people are more<br>interested than they would be otherwise<br>because of the CIA connection<br>but in the case<br>of and the case I'm talking about here<br>uh it's more nuanced it's<br>like the Asia Foundation was<br>promoting us American<br>interests they ultimately they did want<br>they their role was<br>fairly fairly lowkey in the case we're<br>talking about here uh and as I<br>say you know some of these institutions<br>they supported we might want to support<br>as well and that's something I wanted to<br>say as well that we tend to want to say<br>things are bad or good that if you talk<br>about the CIA you the CIA is really<br>something very bad or people who are in<br>the United States who are nationalists<br>might see the ca as something very good<br>but what I want to suggest here is<br>something in the Middle Ground you know<br>that that is<br>not that it shows some of the<br>ambiguities of the situation of that I<br>don't want to say it was something bad<br>or good I want to say it's something<br>that had a<br>certain social and political complexity<br>um and so that's what I want to say here<br>ultimately what I'm interested what did<br>it mean in human terms the people were<br>involved and<br>um so what I'm going to talk about now<br>is how how the Asia foundation made some<br>decisions to withdraw from programs and<br>in the case of this famous Cambodian<br>monk mahako Sanda he had a scholarship<br>and he lost his scholarship because the<br>Asia<br>Foundation um decided his university was<br>com was Communist infiltrated which<br>probably it wasn't um but in his case he<br>was able to get other other kinds of<br>scholarships so it didn't really make<br>that much difference perhaps but but<br>these policies had an effect on with<br>people on the ground and that's what I'm<br>interested in sort of the drama as it<br>played out for the people<br>involved so<br>uh as we've already seen in some of the<br>quotations um uh that there was a<br>preoccupation with China and the need to<br>create an alternative to China's<br>influence and this was part of the Asia<br>foundation's project of education for<br>monks the Asia Foundation archives also<br>illustrate how political considerations<br>were factor in<br>decisions about funding for individual<br>monks Al these decisions were not<br>particular I Ally<br>consistent an early intriguing early<br>case is a monk named chai Pon one of the<br>first to go to India and one of the few<br>Cambodian monks that study in<br>Kolkata and the residence hall where he<br>lived in wat unalam C 58 Chon is<br>remembered is coming from the chaha area<br>across the river from from pen and has<br>having been at wat n nut Rai prior to to<br>wat UNAM this was the Temple of venal so<br>high a scholar monk of the previous<br>generation was also Abbot of w n nansai<br>while also studying stay at wat unom<br>when he taught at the P school chipon<br>was doubtless prot of so high as was<br>uman another Monk from<br>jbal it's not clear under what<br>circumstances he went to India and<br>November<br>1952 the date comes right after<br>mahabodhi Society organ organized tour<br>of relics to Cambodia what we talked<br>about um in our first<br>lecture and the fact that he went to<br>Kolkata may suggest a connection with<br>the mahab bodyi society there in<br>1962 Asia Foundation Memo from the<br>Cambodian Office of the Asia Foundation<br>to the Indian office<br>wrote what he did uh I don't think I<br>have this one uh no I don't have it what<br>he did ining his first two years three<br>years there we do not know but we do<br>know that by 1958 he completed two years<br>of Chinese language and three years of<br>Sanskrit at visva barati China<br>bavona uh santin nikan in Bengal I'm<br>doubtless pronouncing that incorrectly<br>um well there he was under the personal<br>supervision of the director tan tun Chan<br>a man who has come to our attention as<br>having dubious political meanings<br>chai Pon had been a grantee of the<br>foundation since the 1957 58 school year<br>but his scholarship was discontinued<br>last summer 1961 for political reasons<br>so we hear we see example of a student<br>losing his scholarship for political<br>reasons a slightly early member states<br>in more explicit terms that quote we<br>discovered that his primary Professor<br>had strong communist<br>leanings ch had on visits to Cambodia<br>indicated his interest in teaching<br>Sanskrit there and he transferred to the<br>Kolkata Sanskrit University in 1961 in<br>the late 1950s he published two articles<br>in caia of the Buddhist Institute<br>journal the memo indicates an openness<br>to reestablishing his scholarship and<br>ask the Asia Foundation India office to<br>interview him and give an opinion the<br>only further mention of him in the Asia<br>Foundation files is a copy of a letter<br>to him him from the Asia Foundation<br>India Representatives so it appears<br>there was no further funding the mimo<br>gives a Peak at how student monks<br>passing in and out of favor with the<br>Asia Foundation according to perception<br>of their political<br>position we know that by the following<br>year in 1963 he was back in Cambodia<br>still a monk and teaching English at wat<br>un alom and a world Fellowship Buddhist<br>sponsored program Ang soan was the<br>secretary to the Mahan patriarch in the<br>late 1960s and early 1970s before going<br>to India himself states that chipon<br>continued to study in India well into<br>the 1960s without ever completing a<br>degree so the course at w UNAM may have<br>been on a temporary visit to Cambodia<br>chipon remained a monk but after and<br>after returning to Cambodia Sanskrit at<br>the budish University until the PO<br>period a far more a more far-reaching<br>case has to do with the as the Asia<br>Foundation position regarding the Nanda<br>P Institute which that is say Naval<br>Nanda mahavihara uh which I talked about<br>at the beginning of this<br>talk which is of interest in part<br>because it touched the experience of<br>Maho sonanda in<br>India the five monks that the Asia<br>Foundation supported through the<br>Cambodia poly Association All Began<br>their studies in India the Nanda po<br>Institute Nava nand mahavihara The<br>Institute was founded in 1951 by Ja<br>jagadesh kasapa an Indian Buddhist<br>scholar monk which studied in Sri Lanka<br>and taught at Banaras Hindu University<br>before creating the school near the<br>archaeological site of ancient nand<br>University and so here's the slides I<br>showed you earlier uh here's a picture<br>of naand mavara which I took on one of<br>my trips there and a picture of jagadish<br>kasapa uh who was by all accounts a<br>remarkable Monk and a remarkable scholar<br>um uh it attracted students from many<br>countries many of them Buddhist monks or<br>taught who taught who is we've also been<br>talking about wrote in a report<br>following the Asia Foundation funded<br>trip to India it had the advantage of a<br>non-threatening atmosphere where<br>Cambodia monks could get basic skills in<br>English Hindi probably before going on<br>to study elsewhere the school also had<br>Advantage no doubt of being an<br>institution where monks would be among<br>other monks without standing<br>out uh a key document seems to be a 1958<br>Memo by guard to the Asia Foundation<br>representative in Thailand he was<br>critical of naland on two grounds the<br>first was its academic quality um<br>and I can't remember if I have any of<br>these<br>um<br>um Nanda University is still primarily a<br>library research intitute at not a<br>university or even College the teacher<br>guidance of the student is poor training<br>and study and research methods is<br>negligible and unless the student has<br>had prior training in study disciplines<br>he mostly Wast his time at Nanda the<br>possibility that he might learn<br>something at Nanda which he would not in<br>rangon Bangkok should not be Mis<br>construed as indicating that he will<br>receive a first gr college education in<br>London<br>again as we said previously this was<br>there was a condescension to this that<br>um that we would be wise to question um<br>regards other criticism though which is<br>more<br>um perhaps more of interest to us and<br>and this paper is that it had too many<br>connections to<br>China Southeast Asian Buddhist beus<br>among others at Nanda are encouraged to<br>do postgraduate work at pay King because<br>of one pay King offered travel grants<br>scholarships special invitations Etc to<br>the director and probably some other<br>members of Nanda University as well<br>abent toing and are sympathetic to its<br>Buddhist propaganda appeals th Nanda<br>University becomes a staging point for<br>Southeast Asian beus eventually en rout<br>to pay King for<br>indoctrination a result of the cultural<br>relations program exchange between<br>baking and new and New Delhi now this<br>obviously<br>um is very much an American perspective<br>and a perspective of of the Asia<br>Foundation of Suspicion<br>toward um suspicion toward communist<br>relations um uh with China here's a<br>picture of and I I'm sorry I don't<br>remember the Year this took place this<br>was um I believe in the late 50s it was<br>a time when a group of monks uh led by<br>um jagadesh Kasha went to China met with<br>Jan Li um uh according to what I've been<br>told that one of these one of the I<br>think they made a point to bring monks<br>from different nationalities I'm told<br>that one of the one of the monks was a<br>young Cambodian monk amuan who was one<br>of the three monks who went went to<br>Nanda together<br>so so jagadish kipa had um did have a<br>relationship with China um and relating<br>the fact that India had relationship<br>with China<br>um and the Asia Foundation construed<br>this was very suspicious of this<br>and they began talking about navad Alan<br>mahara in terms of Comm infiltration<br>which<br>is probably not the case although it was<br>um it was an institution where people<br>were exploring different ideas leftist<br>as well as rightwing and jagadish kipa<br>was among those who were doing this and<br>definitely relationship with China were<br>considered positive by jages kasep and<br>and but we're very suspicious to the<br>Asia<br>Foundation<br>um<br>um guard's memo is very carefully worded<br>other but other notes and memos at this<br>time used terminology of quote communist<br>infiltration um one said several times<br>our people in pin asked whether the<br>asiia foundation might might support<br>beus at nand University in fact we have<br>at times where guard has since learned<br>that this is not wise because of<br>communist infiltration<br>there guard in evaluating barar Hindu<br>University with<br>right I have heard nothing particularly<br>ideological worrisome about Bernar Hindu<br>University in contrast<br>to Nanda University<br>um<br>um L's rep ation was explicitly a<br>consideration when unet one of the<br>Cambodian poly Association Scholars<br>requested funding to go on to another<br>University<br>um um and I don't think I have that<br>these quotations<br>um<br>um and view of guards g84 on Buddha<br>scholarships I doubt if we will he will<br>approve or endorse Kurt's proposal here<br>I think guard will be all the more<br>doubtful about venerable unet and view<br>of his studies at Nanda which is<br>penetrated by the Communists according<br>to guard again this memo is sort of<br>exaggerating what guard said this was<br>stated more formally in a menu the<br>following month which stated among other<br>things according to diard Nanda<br>Institute Bahar University<br>where saet study previously is<br>penetrated by Communists while the early<br>menu suggested the application would be<br>denied<br>the Cambodian representative protested<br>pointing out that the same logic would<br>be implied denying scholarships to other<br>recipients in this ensuing discussion a<br>larger question was raised reflecting<br>guard's more General misgivings about<br>India as a site for Cambodia M the study<br>quote Dr guard raised a question of<br>whether or not we should send Buddhist<br>students to government institutions in<br>India which officially still condone<br>condones communist China or whether we<br>should utilize instead training centers<br>and Asia found Foundation AED<br>countries and the end unet was given his<br>scholarship although to banares<br>University which was familiar to the<br>Asia Foundation instead of Pune<br>University as he<br>requested<br>um the Asia Foundation archives have<br>relatively few references to mahananda<br>but they document the fact that he Le<br>John and amsun received Asia found<br>funding through the Cambodian poly<br>Association from 1956 to 1958 in 1958<br>his request for continued funding to<br>pursue a doctorate there was turned down<br>for political reasons this was in the<br>same period that unab BET's file was<br>being discussed at the time Maho sanda's<br>application was being considered the<br>other two monks who came with him to<br>India were in the process of<br>transferring to Banaras Hindu University<br>although amuan returned to Cambodia<br>after a family emergency and never<br>studies there is already in November<br>1958 a reference to the decision not to<br>give further scholarship um a to Maho<br>Sanda and this quotation is on the<br>screen new information about the course<br>of studies at the school is contained<br>for example in Richard guard's letter of<br>um 20 September 1958 to Harry<br>Pearson suggests that this is not an<br>appropriate case for Cambodian monks to<br>be aided for this reason we have<br>rejected an application from M Bai the<br>Cambodian poly Association to assist<br>theu V ya whom we've aided in the past<br>to continue for his PhD at<br>Nanda the fact that the issue is still<br>being discussed in March ex just<br>internal debate the March memo goes on<br>into this in more detail and other<br>sources it's not hostile to mahand<br>himself it shows that there had been<br>friendly communication with him and that<br>the possibility had been suggested if<br>his studying elsewhere including Japan<br>or Yale it even goes far to suggest we<br>were also talking in terms of having<br>Nar a ra Temple Colo andest out of Dr<br>pelzer's plan test out Dr pelzer's plan<br>for establishing a Buddhist center at<br>Yale this memo refers to the fact M<br>doctoral thesis had to do with<br>comparison between Buddhism and<br>communism the document did not in any<br>way suggest that Maho sonan had<br>communist leanings himself although it<br>was concerned with the possibility that<br>supporting a student working on this<br>topic could have negative repercussions<br>for the Asia<br>Foundation three arguments are made<br>first that quote uh if the thesis were<br>to be published and distributed in<br>Cambodia and contained the references to<br>the Onish of Communism it is conceivable<br>that the Asia Foundation might be<br>criticized for supporting the monk who<br>has concerned himself with political<br>ideas of the relation ship of Buddhism<br>and communism uh secondly there was fear<br>that the government of India might<br>question the appropriateness of the<br>topic finally there's again reference to<br>guard's critique of Nanda in the last<br>issue the key issue quote in view of Dr<br>guard strong reservations against Nanda<br>we do not believe that we could reverse<br>suddenly reverse our stand on this<br>institution just accommodate by<br>y I spelled Yao wrong in the in Maho<br>Sanda was supported by a government of<br>India scholarship for the Romania for<br>his time at Nanda<br>um by 1959 guard was aware that jagadish<br>Kash had left Nan and speculated this<br>might have changed the institution's<br>political flection<br>uh<br>um the Asia foundation in the end had no<br>problem he would later come back and<br>seemed to have been continued to be<br>Maho Sanda uh thesis<br>advisor um the Asia Foundation then had<br>no problem in contributing to fund monks<br>who'd been at aland once they went to<br>other schools more Cambodian monks did<br>end up going to India and studying at<br>Nanda however after this time there was<br>no Asia Foundation funding for monks<br>there<br>um so here I'm going to<br>uh to shift to uh some things I I wrote<br>about in yet another article and which<br>is not in this article and um and in<br>your reading packet I included<br>and<br>um an article from mahabi society<br>Journal about about by jagadish Kip and<br>um and it's interesting I also when I<br>talk to people in and India about jagesh<br>kipa whether he had any um any leftist<br>leanings uh they'll say no no not at all<br>and uh and yet he himself had a complex<br>relationship to to Marxism and in the<br>article that I include in the reading<br>packet there is a a a very at a very<br>abstract level uh a discussion of of the<br>degree to which Marxism and Buddhism uh<br>had shared Concepts which um he makes it<br>sound like he just happened to find this<br>book on Marxism in in a bookstore but<br>but we know that there were other<br>Buddhist intellectuals in India at this<br>time who are very much interested in the<br>ways that um that Marxism and Buddhism<br>could combine at this time and uh jish<br>kup in his early career was affiliated<br>with two other Indian monks who had also<br>ordained red in Sri Lanka um one maybe<br>the most famous of was the monk depicted<br>in the center here named Rahul sanr<br>yayan who um who definitely uh I who did<br>major work uh in Tibet uh brought<br>manuscripts important manuscripts B to<br>India um uh<br>eventually um leaving the monkhood uh<br>and he definitely identified himself as<br>a Marxist he he he wrote these these<br>bizarre novels which which depicted sort<br>of a a<br>pre<br>um A Primitive state of of Buddhist<br>socialism um I I don't know these works<br>very well um but he was quite an<br>important influence on Indian Buddhism<br>and he was basically ddes<br>kiva's uh mentor and and so it's a<br>little bit naive to say that jagadesh<br>Kash<br>was was unaware of of issues of com the<br>combination of of of socialism and<br>Buddhism uh another one who was closer<br>to jagadish's age was named Anan Kali<br>kalianan who who would be again a<br>Buddhist thinker who drew heavily on<br>Marx's ideas the rest of his life he he<br>ended up uh being closely associated<br>with uh the movement of delitz who had<br>converted to converted to BU Budd<br>Buddhism after the death of Edgar and so<br>so what I want to say is that these<br>issues<br>was was Navan Nanda a a hot bed of<br>socialism well no apparently it was not<br>and yet there were were there were there<br>was Progressive movements there these<br>were ideas that were in the air in in<br>Buddhist Buddhist thinking Buddhist<br>thinking in in India during these times<br>was very much uh associated with ideas<br>about the roles of of of lower class<br>populations uh and and so it does seem<br>that naand mAh was principally a a site<br>for an institution was devoted to the<br>textural study uh and yet and yet it was<br>not completely divorced from political<br>atmosphere later on a later period which<br>really a later period there were there<br>were protests there were many Vietnamese<br>students studying at at Nanda they they<br>protested uh<br>no denim's suppression of of<br>um of Buddhism in Vietnam uh what do I<br>have what pictures do I have here<br>um uh one of the few monks I'm doing<br>research few former monks I'm doing<br>research on uh is who's still alive who<br>I interviewed on my recent trip to<br>India's named Kel Pama and K Pama um<br>would emphasize that he was never a<br>communist himself um<br>uh although at the same time he says<br>that we learn that he and this was in a<br>later period in the 60s he was involved<br>in Progressive movements protest against<br>um peasant peasant movement protests in<br>the area around Nanda um so there was it<br>was a complex situation and I think the<br>Asia Foundation was wrong to Simply say<br>that naand mahavar was Communist<br>infiltrated I think that was that was an<br>ignorant characterization of of a of an<br>institution but which like any<br>institution would have a lot of<br>different people involved some who were<br>more Progressive in orientation some who<br>are more scholarly and orientation and<br>so and so we have this situation of the<br>Asia<br>Foundation uh labeling Nava nand<br>mahavihara as communist infiltrat which<br>was not really<br>fair and and yet probably like all<br>educational in institutions in India it<br>had its<br>own uh complexity of political movements<br>and ideas and circulation<br>um um okay um so the last section I'm<br>going to talk about about about monks<br>choosing to disrobe um as and this<br>becomes an interesting issue as well and<br>more controversial than one might think<br>and it shows that there were very<br>different conceptions by the Asia<br>foundation and the Cambodian monks who<br>received scholarships about what was<br>appropriate and inappropriate in terms<br>of the possibility of these scholarship<br>recipients<br>leaving their monastic robes<br>um<br>uh the Asia Foundation understood that<br>in the Southeast Asian terab tradition<br>there is no shame attached to leaving<br>the monkhood and memos show an awareness<br>quite early that many monks were likely<br>to dis robe if not in India Upon<br>returning to<br>Cambodia in the memo quoted above guard<br>suggested that international study might<br>increase the likelihood of leaving the<br>monkhood but probably the incidence of<br>leaving the Monk Is No Greater in the<br>general monastic population and the end<br>it came down to the fact that the<br>funding by being defined as quote for<br>monks had little categorical<br>flexibility it did not recognize the<br>inherent influx of this category in<br>actual practice monks themselves may<br>have been naive and not perceiving<br>this it is interesting that in the first<br>case of this happening the Asia<br>Foundation did not revoke its<br>scholarship the monk was named kud<br>kilang who to India in December 1952 to<br>study languages and pursue a bachelor's<br>degree and was already there in<br>1956 when the Asia Foundation began<br>funding him through World Fellowship of<br>Buddhist<br>Cambodia there may have been more of a<br>personal connection to him than to other<br>monks since he had studied English with<br>Overton at wat UN in 1951 52 before<br>going to India a<br>1959 memo States two years after the<br>fact that quote K kilang left the robe<br>in May 1957 with a permission of the<br>head of the mahika order and the world<br>Buddhist Association of Cambodia he<br>stated in his request that he had<br>difficulty with food could not mix<br>freely<br>with uh with students and others in<br>India he would return to Cambodia if<br>permission were not<br>granted uh quy Lang seems to be making<br>progress in his studies and might be<br>supported through his back degree<br>although it is not clear whether he<br>should be aided up to the Master's<br>Degree stage the fact that he is not a<br>monk is perhaps not too important since<br>he has signed a contract to teach in the<br>religious<br>schools The Others May well quit the<br>robe when they return to Cambodia so<br>it's interesting in this original case<br>there was some flexibility toward an<br>early monk which may have influence uh<br>monst later we know that Kochi Lang was<br>back in Cambodia by November 19 1961<br>when he translated into K some of the<br>English sections of the program for the<br>world Fellowship of Buddhist meetings in<br>in pen and is identified as teaching at<br>the Buddhist University during this<br>period he also published a translation a<br>short article in the Journal of Buddhist<br>Institute campuchia sya later he later<br>completed a master's degree in education<br>at Ohio<br>University another recipient in man also<br>had also left the monode in the 1959<br>recommended discontinuation of his<br>scholarship not so much for this reason<br>as for poor academic progress but World<br>Fellowship of Buddhist Cambodia kept<br>supporting him with his own funds for<br>time it was in 1962 1963 that the issue<br>really came to the four two cases Stand<br>Out chimp Pon and Lee Kim long and from<br>interviews we know something of the<br>personal<br>circumstances of them leaving the monk<br>Hood<br>from the Asia Foundation files we know<br>that chimp porn's case arose at the same<br>time the Asia Foundation was struggling<br>to put in place a new approach to<br>scholarships where the first graduates<br>of the Buddhist University in Cambodia<br>would be sent to India directly by the<br>Asia foundation without going through<br>the<br>associations a May 1962 memo stated that<br>quote all five of the<br>monks expressed um a desire to defro<br>before leaving for India but the<br>authorities of the University were are<br>not in favor of this strong pressure<br>will be put on them to remain<br>monks by July four of the five monks had<br>decided not to go to India if it<br>remaining his monks uh quote we have<br>just been notified by the officials of<br>the Buddhist University that four of the<br>five monks discussed and cam11 will not<br>be going to India to study after all the<br>reason for such a start development is<br>that at the last minute four of them<br>refused to accept the scholarship unless<br>they would be permitted to defro PRI<br>prior to depart in Cambodia the<br>university officials would not go ahead<br>with the scholarship on this basis and<br>we are in complete agreement with our<br>position neither we nor the university<br>is particularly interested in providing<br>scholarship for these young men as<br>individuals our joint interest is in<br>raising the standards of Buddhist<br>education system by offering Advanced<br>study to mon who will eventually teach<br>in Buddhist<br>schools all this occurred only days<br>before the Asia Foundation was<br>confronted with the fact that chimp P<br>had left the monkhood chimp Pon was one<br>of the Cambodian monks studying in<br>Thailand who returned in 1958 because of<br>diplomatic tensions between the<br>countries he was selected for Thailand<br>by the mahiki patriarch junad and<br>received funding from Tha government<br>studying at mahat La long corn and<br>Resident at Wat benam pit of the monks<br>in India he has a special case in that<br>his Asia Foundation was funding was at<br>the request of Hut who told them that<br>Chon was quote a devoted Monk and likely<br>to remain one he was the first monk to<br>be sponsored by the Asia Foundation<br>directly not through one of the lay<br>Buddhist<br>organizations all this changed<br>when as the story is told by chimp's<br>Widow and family documents he was shown<br>a picture of his future wife T samat<br>soon after arriving in Kolkata and was<br>as it were struck by lightning she' come<br>to India with her sister the wife of<br>diomatic to pursue her education and<br>Deli he met her in person and their<br>common studies created opportunities for<br>them to see each other family members<br>recall it as a tum romance um and those<br>of you know Cambodian literature know<br>this is a reference to a Romeo and<br>Juliet like story well-known work of<br>Cambodian literature where a young man<br>still in robes falls in love tragically<br>with a beautiful young<br>woman Tat's family soon sent her back to<br>Cambodia perhaps because they were<br>uncomfortable with budding romance chimp<br>Pon remained in India to complete his<br>degree but after returning to Cambodia<br>initiated traditional practic whereby<br>one family approaches another to<br>negotiate the marriage they were married<br>in<br>1964<br>his romantic crisis was doubtless a<br>major consideration and in his decision<br>to leave the<br>robes the Asia Foundation learned here<br>this Roe from the Asia Foundation India<br>representative um and here's where<br>quotation appears on the screen recently<br>Jim green visited the two Cambodian<br>monks studying at the University of<br>Delhi chimp Pon appears to have adopted<br>protective camouflage with his long<br>curly hair blue checked sport shirt and<br>navy slacks his virally<br>indistinguishable from the other<br>students at Delhi University ukin has<br>slightly greater facility in English<br>probably warned of the foundation visit<br>several days Advance he wore saffr robes<br>in a crew cut he was quickly informed<br>that chimp Pon had dis robed later in<br>the conversation he stated that he did<br>not take food or drink after noon which<br>indicates that he is trying to observe<br>the V<br>rules 6 weeks later a ler was sent to<br>Chimp Pon telling him that his scholar<br>was revoked in a later letter to the<br>Asia Foundation chimp por makes it clear<br>that he<br>informed OT and to not of his decision<br>to live the leave the<br>monod I am not a man without conscience<br>um I made my decision after reflection<br>before leaving the robes I wrote to<br>venerable poang who taught into the<br>Supreme patriarch informing them it is<br>telling that neither they nor chimp<br>perceived any need to inform the Asia<br>Foundation um chimp's March 1963 to the<br>Asia Foundation is one of the most<br>intriguing documents and the Asia<br>Foundation files on monk scholarships<br>and that is one of the only documents to<br>give any glimpse of what the recipients<br>were actually thinking as well as<br>showing how monks were not always<br>passive recipients of Asia Foundation<br>Bounty the letter was a response not to<br>the original letter informing chimp that<br>his scholarship was revoked which he<br>claimed to never rece but to a later<br>exchange when the Asia Foundation denied<br>him his request for airfare to return to<br>Cambodia the letter was written after<br>his return the original was in Kai but<br>the record in the files is a translation<br>into French which the Asia Foundation<br>pen sent to offices in<br>India the company Asia Foundation me<br>Memo calls it quote a violent letter and<br>refers to invective in it is in fact<br>unusually confrontive by Cambodian<br>standards and sometimes employ sarcasm<br>uh quote I never broke my agreement is<br>the Asia Foundation which is the author<br>of this rupture you like to change your<br>mind quickly like<br>children but it develops this argument<br>carefully and now without<br>logic one of the main arguments of the<br>letter is that the original contract<br>signed by him and the Asia foundation<br>made no mention of any requirement that<br>the recipient May remain in the monkhood<br>the the requirement the letter argues<br>was in effect added after the<br>fact he could have mentioned that there<br>was precedent for monks leaving the<br>robes without losing<br>scholarships the letter affirms that the<br>Asia Foundation categorized leaving the<br>monks the robes unfairly as something<br>negative when it's considered natural in<br>Cambodian Society by making a comparison<br>with us attitudes toward communism the<br>letter opens up a political Dimension<br>suggesting perhaps that in this area as<br>well the US had been caught up in the<br>underlying assumptions of its<br>discourse<br>um and here the quotation is on the<br>screen you persist in always repeating<br>the term defro the same way your<br>government does communist communist you<br>should know how to use the term and use<br>it with regard to its application to<br>real human beings not distorting it or<br>exploiting it as do people in the<br>category of the uneducated don't confuse<br>it with the use of defro in Christianity<br>for Christian who conducts himself<br>villainously and is excluded from a<br>religious community is categories as<br>defro um then he writes in English of a<br>priest who has behave badly dismiss him<br>from the priesthood within Buddhism in<br>Cambodia assuming or leaving the robes<br>is a common act because any individual<br>except a woman can situate himself and<br>religious life and it is always the case<br>that they remain in that state for a<br>certain number of days days or month or<br>for a whole lifetime without any<br>constraint put on he goes on to discuss<br>the difficulties of being a monk in a<br>non- Buddhist country again ending in a<br>provocative Cold War analogy<br>um<br>um a quote a religious studying abroad<br>has serious difficulties the local<br>communities look down on and its<br>religious State looked down on and<br>finally there is no progress in studies<br>and a similar situation you would see<br>for yourself if you an American pursued<br>your studies in the Soviet Union and if<br>you behaved as capitalist in the school<br>or in the Soviet Community how would the<br>Russians perceive you would you not be a<br>thorn to the Russians finally what would<br>become of your<br>studies and and so even though this<br>is uh a letter about leaving the<br>monkhood uh it becomes a letter with<br>political overtones uh he then makes a<br>reference to something very current in<br>Cambodia accusations that the US had<br>supported a regional power Lord in his<br>Rebellion against c a sign of<br>anti-American sentiments in cambod which<br>were beginning to grow which perhaps<br>gave chimp Pon some feelings of<br>justification and opposing the<br>US quote so who's at fault me or you why<br>do you like putting the blame on others<br>why do you support one person to kill<br>another this way of acting doesn't<br>differ from that of your government<br>which supported the traitor doop Chuan<br>in his attempt to<br>destroy samat that is C or our very<br>revered father our very revered father<br>of<br>Independence he makes it clear that the<br>fact that he is writing in chir instead<br>of English is no<br>accident quote previously I wrote to you<br>in English why this time do I write in<br>Cambodian the use of English in our<br>correspondence is meaningless it is<br>useless<br>finally he makes a reference to<br>cambodia's historical<br>Grandeur quote Anor wat was constructed<br>by Cambodian Kings Cambodian Builders<br>and Cambodian finances not with American<br>Aid the irony is that after all this<br>chimp Pon would end up being an<br>announcer for Voice of America Upon<br>returning to Cambodia established an<br>English Language School however<br>political relations with the US<br>deteriorated and the Cambodian<br>government orchestrated demonstrations<br>against the US and great Britain he<br>found he could not attract students his<br>fiance T samat had worked at the US<br>library in pen and was planning to take<br>a voice of America Examination for<br>potential employees on her encouragement<br>he took the exam as well un certain of<br>his Direction he returned to India to<br>study University of isali with a<br>government of India scholarship while<br>there he received word that his voice of<br>American application was accepted and he<br>flew to the US from India with his wife<br>in December 1967<br>he would play a major role in the<br>creation of the first Cambodian Buddhist<br>temple in the US um so this I think is<br>the most dramatic case<br>of um which<br>has which reveals the personal situation<br>of Cambodian mon study<br>in in India with Asia Foundation<br>funding uh and how there was a cultural<br>and the understanding of what this kind<br>of scholarship could even<br>mean<br>um the other case is Lee Kim Long whose<br>decision to leave the monkhood came soon<br>after interaction with chimpan that Asia<br>Foundation immediately made reference to<br>the earlier runin the first reference to<br>leim status news status at the end of<br>July<br>1963 and brought interesting news<br>apparently leim long has joined the<br>chimp Pon Brigade and now Sports longer<br>hair neatly pressed trousers and<br>bleeding mattress sheets now what more<br>formal communication soon followed ah as<br>you can imagine we were more than a<br>little disturbed by the fact news that<br>leim long has apparently joined the<br>rapidly growing Alumni Association of<br>Former monks we immediately contacted<br>the world Fellowship of Buddhist to find<br>out what they knew about all this the<br>secretary of the world Fellowship of<br>Buddhist confirmed that they received a<br>letter from leim long dated July 7th<br>stating that the life of a monk in India<br>was was too difficult and he desired to<br>defro on July 22nd what made us raise<br>our<br>eyebrows was that after receiving this<br>letter from India they they on July 30th<br>still ask us to give him a scholarship<br>um from the mimo it seems clear that<br>leim long much more than chimpan would<br>have understood the implications of<br>decision since the<br>aftermath of the chimp confrontation the<br>issue had been discussed with<br>scholarship recipients nevertheless the<br>Asia<br>Foundation proceeded very carefully leim<br>long had a long history of study outside<br>of the Cambodia going to Burma for three<br>years um and then to Sri Lanka where he<br>completed bachor de with the Asia<br>Foundation funding at the time he left<br>the roads he was in an MA program at<br>banar andu<br>University Asia Foundation reports make<br>it clear that he was academically one of<br>the most promising of the scholarship<br>recipients Asia Foundation July 20th<br>letter to him inquiring if he had left<br>the monkhood<br>cross and the mail with a letter from<br>him informing them that he had passed<br>his preliminary<br>examinations from interviews we know<br>that leim long met and fell in love with<br>an American woman Barbara Jean Stanford<br>who was also a student at berar and new<br>University dharmar maha's granddaughter<br>recalls that everyone was shocked when<br>they arrived together at the show<br>Commission in Delhi dharmar performed<br>the ceremony removing Lee himlong from<br>The monkhood and then off officiated<br>over the wedding Lee himlong with would<br>stay in India and complete his master's<br>degree in doctrate returning to Cambodia<br>with his wife in 1970 he later became a<br>dean of the faculty of of social science<br>and Humanities at Pin<br>University<br>uh<br>um<br>so<br>um to conclude regionally there was an<br>increasing<br>distrust of the United States in the<br>1960s<br>um soon after nwin overthrew unu in the<br>1962 he announced the Asia Foundation<br>the Ford Foundation the British Council<br>and the full brght cultural Exchange<br>program would no longer be allowed to<br>work in Burma cambodia's head of state<br>noroo became increasingly distrustful of<br>the United States after the<br>assassination of no noden zum in<br>November nber 1963 he already had reason<br>to suspect that the US aided Rebel<br>activities against his own regime later<br>that month he announced he was cutting<br>off us Aid relations with us were<br>tumultuous over the next year and a half<br>and devolved to the point where<br>diplomatic relations were totally broken<br>off in May 3rd<br>1965 Overton transferred to saon that<br>year but the Asia Foundation maintained<br>offices inment even past the date of the<br>break in relations until March 1st 196<br>66 even though its activities were<br>attenuated another slate of monst was<br>slated to go to India in 1965 but the<br>Asia Foundation decided it would not<br>attempt to implement the agreement one<br>monk Li Cree determined to get his<br>scholarship flew to India at his own<br>expense and wrote to the Asia Foundation<br>that he was already in India and<br>expected his funding for the terms of<br>his<br>contract diplomatic ties between the US<br>and Cambodia were not reestablished<br>until 196<br>9 the Asia Foundation honored their<br>commitment scholarship recipients until<br>the end of their studies even after the<br>pumpin office was closed L Cree is<br>referred to in 1967 as the last of the<br>scholarship recipients even though his<br>scholarship funding ended that year he<br>was still communicating with the Asia<br>Foundation about return airfare in 1969<br>and was writing to the Asia Foundation<br>to inform them about progress in his<br>studies until the 1970s he was still in<br>India when Cambodia fell to the cou in<br>1975 and among a group of Cambodian ex<br>monks who would seek Refugee status in<br>the United<br>States price cites a 1966 article from<br>The Washington Post which already quoted<br>cuk expressing<br>suspicions that the CIA was working<br>behind the Asia Foundation evidenced by<br>their remaining in Cambodia despite<br>hostility Asia Foundation no longer had<br>offic in Cambodia when in March 1967 its<br>CIA connections were exposed in an<br>article in Ram parts<br>magazine the following month a Cambodian<br>French language magazine edited by CN<br>published an article calling attention<br>to the Asia Foundation CIA a links and<br>this is what you see here um a<br>SP Asia Foundation the article<br>acknowledged that many in Cambodia who<br>had benefited from the Asia L Foundation<br>L guest had expressed regret it when it<br>was asked to leave the country the<br>previous year and that were those who<br>had fond memories of over Overton as<br>quote a FR true friend of Cambodia and<br>of his<br>successor John bannington described as<br>quote a Charming drunk it pointed<br>nevertheless to a recent article in the<br>New York Times on indirect links between<br>the Asia foundation and the<br>CIA the scholarship program probably did<br>overall strengthen Buddhist education in<br>Cambodia at the time the Buddhist<br>University was just beginning in 1963<br>Asia Foundation memo refers to the<br>salary effects the incorporation into<br>the Buddhist education system of three<br>monks would return from India two of<br>them Asia Foundation<br>Scholars scholarship recipients probably<br>M and<br>unet a number of monks and ex monks I've<br>interviewed recall with fondness that<br>professors at the buddh<br>University anden University who had<br>studied in<br>India The Prestige of studying in India<br>was firmly established and monks<br>continued to go there in the late 60s<br>and the 70s perhaps most with government<br>of India scholarships Cambodian monks<br>began going for study there again and<br>the early<br>2000s needless to say if the Asia<br>foundation's ultimate goal was to create<br>in Cambodian Buddhism a bulwark against<br>the karou they did not<br>succeed Lee Kim Long's wife Barbara<br>returned to the US in 19 72 he<br>subsequently had a child with another<br>woman as a security deteriorated in the<br>course of the war he made a decision to<br>send the baby girl to live with Barbara<br>in the US perhaps in late<br>1974 there is no record for him after<br>pen fell to the C Rouge actually um I've<br>recently been shown copies of as<br>Cambodia was falling to kou in 1975 the<br>US state department memos had not said<br>said that Barbara had contact the United<br>States trying to get worried about her<br>her husband<br>which who who had<br>disappeared<br>um um M like Le him long by then a<br>professor at the P univers perceived the<br>risk of staying in the country in the<br>months before the country fell and made<br>a decision to leave with the help of his<br>friend chimp Pon he joined the voice of<br>America as a language announcer his<br>reputation as a professor at the<br>Buddhist University in plumin University<br>added to his Prestige as an announcer<br>and then credibility to voice of<br>American<br>broadcast person who had studied outside<br>of Cambodia would have been among the<br>most vulnerable in the commish period<br>um and<br>perhaps all Asia Foundation scholarship<br>recipients resident in COD would have<br>died<br>um<br>so<br>um P originally studied at Nanda with<br>Asia Foundation funding through the<br>Cambodian poly Association many later<br>supported his they later supported his<br>master's degree studies at University of<br>Delhi Upon returning to Cambodia he<br>taught at the Buddhist<br>University and continued working there<br>after leaving the robes in June 1968 his<br>appear his picture appears in Lum a<br>French language magazine as an example<br>of a promising young leader in C's Mass<br>organization<br>s and the Popa period he was jailed and<br>eventually killed at the<br>notorious S21 detention center now known<br>as tools slang Museum of genocidal crime<br>from his confession we know that at the<br>time trumen was evacuated he went with<br>his family to Southern kandal Province a<br>year later he was apprehended in prison<br>in S21 like other prisoners there he was<br>forced under torture to write<br>confessions and the confessions were<br>invariably supposed to provide the<br>names of foreign intelligent networks he<br>he he was supposedly connected to he<br>provides a list of of his supposed<br>connection to CIA basically a fantasy<br>list naming pretty much everyone he<br>worked with or had contact with with<br>obviously no connection to reality the<br>interesting thing is there's absolutely<br>no mention of the Asia Foundation nor of<br>course of the fact which he doubtless<br>did not know that the Asia Foundation<br>was linked to the CIA and okay that's my<br>my talk today and so<br>questions I'm just<br>curious so I've said the term like Asian<br>Foundation but the contemp role is is<br>totally different<br>what it was before so it's now I don't<br>know if it's the same organization it's<br>a continuity of the organization uh<br>I um it does not<br>have I I feel quite confident it is no<br>longer funded by the CIA um it still um<br>it's still it's an American foundation<br>and<br>uh I I it's my my belief is that it's<br>quite POS quite well respected at least<br>in Cambodia um it does very positive uh<br>makes positive contributions to uh with<br>links to other non non-governmental<br>organizations many of them Cambodian<br>non-governmental organization they they<br>work throughout the world and uh um it<br>it's still an American American<br>organization it still um uh arguably<br>still<br>has<br>um comes out of an American perception<br>of the world American ideas of what<br>should be promoted in the world um is<br>that your perception um so um so it's<br>more so so what what you look as is the<br>link between like the support of<br>civilization<br>with the mon the monastic community in<br>um in the past yeah in the past but I'm<br>I'm I'm not pretty sure if there<br>is that support still exist I I doubt it<br>this was an exceptional case in that um<br>in<br>American law I believe that there's<br>supposed to be a separation between<br>government and religious institution<br>normally the US government would not<br>fund religious institutions and so in<br>this case it was something this is one<br>of the reasons<br>why it was pretending to not just<br>because the CIA has a reputation of CI<br>it was that also that there was this<br>feeling that US government should not be<br>involved in religious activities at all<br>uh so I suspect I might be wrong that um<br>Asia Foundation at the present time<br>would not<br>be uh so so directly involved in<br>religious organizations although they<br>might for example support an<br>NGO<br>that that might have had that might<br>have um a religious Dimension but they<br>would be supporting them not as not as a<br>religion but as for their Social Service<br>Pro projects that would be my<br>understanding of their role at the<br>present time although I'm<br>not I'm I'm not a<br>direct um I I'm not totally aware of all<br>the activities of the person<br>time okay so so I just have to say<br>they're also active in Thailand yeah<br>yeah that what I'm gonna ask to and as I<br>said the the book the book by Eugene<br>Ford is specifically focused on Asia<br>foundation and activities in Thailand<br>and so uh in a way what we have through<br>the Ford book is a much more<br>extensive uh investigation into the role<br>of the Asia foundation in relationship<br>to Buddhism than what than what I'm<br>offering here uh and specifically in<br>relationship<br>to to um to Thailand and the<br>uh a key person in Thailand was uh<br>clauser what what is cluser Willam claer<br>who was very well respected by he was an<br>American but had very deep ties to<br>Thailand and um who was on the committee<br>of the S Society okay and he hosted us<br>for lunch in what year was it 2016<br>before he died<br>um gave Eugene Ford his documents yeah<br>so here's the reason why Eugene Ford was<br>able to write this book so there were<br>active like before also like with bam I<br>mean like what he was in charge of Tyler<br>Overtown was in charge of Cambodia like<br>they had operatives in each Buddhist<br>country I forget<br>charge um yeah they had there were there<br>were some countries where there they<br>ended their their presence like in Burma<br>uh it was a calculated decision uh to<br>which seemed to come to an agreement<br>with the Burmese government there was<br>not necessarily any hostility there but<br>a decision was made to no longer<br>continue activities in Burma after the<br>late 50s for example and so um I don't<br>know for specific countries where they<br>were and where they not they operated in<br>many countries throughout the world oh<br>throughout Asia uh yeah what was that um<br>I don't know the the original reason why<br>they start against communism yes um so<br>it's Canna be seen as like um I don't<br>know it's can be call like part<br>of um well Cold War colonization or cold<br>war colonialization yeah yeah or what<br>you can call it colonialism neoc<br>colonialism uh uh the the US<br>uh actively promoted its its influence<br>in the world<br>in uh in ways that were maybe sometime<br>positive and many times not so<br>positive and and you look at s<br>tanarat you know the prime minister of<br>Thailand was at 5657 he was afraid of<br>Communism getting a<br>foothold so he would have welcomed<br>support oh okay<br>from this organization to strengthen<br>Buddhism to<br>protect from communism because you know<br>yeah<br>um yeah I I read about that about a<br>CIA like yeah so they<br>were quite negative<br>in In tha some I mean some yeah yes no I<br>I think we tend to be very suspicious of<br>um and this was in Thailand uh and<br>Thailand's never been colonized so why<br>did they let yeah yeah this happen<br>because they wanted support against<br>communism they were really worried about<br>communist you know sure Communists were<br>doing quite well in the Northeast did<br>um there is a connection there there was<br>a few monks that<br>were but I'm not saying you know we<br>can't take it too far but you know I<br>don't remember all the details I think<br>some also some Buddhist figures who were<br>more Progressive and orientation also<br>sometimes receive funding from the Asia<br>Foundation the Asia Foundation was not<br>exclusively or primarily an organization<br>to fund um buddhis to fund Buddhist many<br>of their activities had to do with<br>education um health health care they<br>were funding a whole range of a range of<br>activities in different countries um and<br>they and their activities at the present<br>time I believe in Cambodia and Al where<br>are to support um NGO type work that<br>will<br>will not not so political yeah which is<br>not so clearly political um the unusual<br>thing is that this particular time they<br>they did make the decision to actively<br>support Buddhist<br>organizations um and Buddhist<br>organizations they believe<br>communism so they support the world<br>Fellowship of<br>Buddhism<br>they gave money but then eventually they<br>fell out with mola sea because he he<br>China you know yeah so these things are<br>complicated yeah like these Asia<br>Foundation type organizations now also I<br>don't think they're they're like not<br>political because they're trying to<br>support the liberal ideas in they got in<br>a lot of trouble and during the the when<br>the Americans lost the Vietnam War there<br>was a loss of<br>appetite for this sort of thing<br>throughout Asia like everyone's going no<br>thank you we don't really want that but<br>yeah but it's complicated and even now<br>you can say they're not political in the<br>same way they were then they they're not<br>what's political they're not linked to<br>the CIA they but for example they would<br>support NOS in some<br>countries uh noos are are encouraged<br>more than in other countries like the<br>the US um again I'm maybe it's dangerous<br>for to me to make any statements of this<br>kind at all<br>but like in Cambodia at a certain point<br>the US began to decrease its direct Aid<br>to the government and instead gave money<br>to NGO organizations non-governmental<br>organizations even that and some of<br>these non-governmental organizations<br>might have<br>been uh might have then receiv received<br>funding through the as foundation and so<br>even this has it has its own political<br>implications it has the fact that the US<br>chooses certain projects to support and<br>other projects not to support and which<br>are not overtly political uh they're not<br>supporting political parties um they're<br>supporting Aid and yet some projects May<br>appeal to them more than other projects<br>their the kinds of projects they they<br>value more than maybe another<br>so now I'm just thinking about the NGS<br>that support Buddhist<br>nons tell me that's not political like<br>when you get a western organization<br>going into Sri<br>Lanka supporting they just<br>nons<br>yeah I mean and who does support the<br>well in Cambodia the H mcbul Foundation<br>supported the nons<br>organization you know like those ones<br>that<br>um Gian wrote about you know<br>um because they're all operating in the<br>same Paradigm it's just like<br>a progressive very marked driven<br>Paradigm it's not like communist<br>do song is rolling in<br>it's anxiety because of this feminism<br>that's coming in from the West which<br>doesn't understand traditional sh Lankan<br>culture are there any more comments or<br>participants S I believe uh well there's<br>Angela and I believe the other<br>yeah hello<br>um yeah I I find the the discussion is<br>very interesting regarding the the a<br>foundation I think now the I think you<br>are absolutely right about the current<br>activities I think they still uh<br>affiliated with some uh non-governmental<br>organization in<br>cambod especially some non-governmental<br>organization Al Buddhist NGO and uh<br>because I used to work there before and<br>there is some uh uh interns from the<br>Asia Foundation to to to work in as<br>internship in the Cambodia and this<br>still affiliated but not I'm not sure it<br>is a the direct link between the<br>Buddhist NGO with the Asia Foundation<br>but there still a some affiliation<br>between the the uh NGO in Cambodia and<br>the the Asia Foundation is still going<br>on I believe okay that's interesting too<br>yeah and it's not a bad thing yeah I<br>just yeah I'm not saying it's you know<br>right and I I tend to think<br>the despite the CIA connection there<br>were some good things that came out of<br>the Asia Foundation support of Cambodian<br>1960s and mahag goand I mean it's<br>fascinating I don't really have he this<br>was he nominated for Nobel peace priz or<br>did he get one he did not get one he was<br>nominated he he he did win a major<br>Japanese uh Peace Prize but but this is<br>a book by him um but are you on shall I<br>hold it up yes please but he's very<br>famous I don't know if you've heard of<br>him but at the time when yeah I I read<br>it before<br>yeah the Cambodian monks will all all<br>have heard of of him and yeah he's quite<br>friendless he still not that well known<br>outside<br>people interest in Cambodia although uh<br>his his his reputation is increasing I<br>believe I think he's a Canon<br>to the Supreme Patrick of<br>Cambodia the S of<br>cambod I think you also wrote it in the<br>his name in the article but M I think he<br>he number two I think I believe yeah<br>that's in the past I know it's in the<br>past you're right<br>right in the past is popularity is I<br>think yeah I when I talk to younger<br>monks I think there is increasing<br>interest in mahaga now is more<br>International if compared to um to to to<br>to in this Cas of course he was outside<br>of Cambodia under the during the Comm<br>true yeah abely so he was never disrup<br>and he did a very brave Thing by going<br>to the refugee camps and then walking<br>across land that was held by the<br>camarouge and sort of taking it back for<br>peace um that was a terribly Brave thing<br>for him to do indeed yeah his story is<br>so quite uh inspiring and and uh um so<br>beautiful as<br>well I believe I know Buddhist man who<br>used to work with him yeah his name is<br>I'm not sure that you heard of his name<br>before but he's yeah we social bu hang M<br>chenda and of course I used to work with<br>him and oh oh oh that's great that's<br>great and of course um s that it's very<br>close to Mah yeah that y S as well uh<br>was um Mar was walked in one in some of<br>the<br>early early East walks as<br>yatra so it's like they're making a SEMA<br>piece around just to go back to the SEMA<br>analogy pardon making a SEMA of piece of<br>boundary around Cambodia<br>of reconc in Cambodia for well that's an<br>interesting idea I I would like to know<br>if you have uh somebody said that to me<br>I didn't know okay<br>yeah um but yeah the dam yatra was like<br>reconsecration Cambodia for pism yeah I<br>lot and they had landmines and people<br>shooting at them you know C shooting at<br>them I mean it was a big deal no<br>weapons<br>and deal yeah and I'm old enough that I<br>I remember I did<br>not<br>ever well on one of the walks I I had<br>friends who were Cambodian monks and<br>when the the the people came to plumin I<br>joined the walk when they walked around<br>pumin but I did not uh participate in<br>the long walk but I I remember I I was<br>in Cambodia at the time of the first<br>walk<br>and it was a very emotional thing uh and<br>we were quite aware of these walks and<br>it seemed to be very significant at the<br>time so yeah I was too young to remember<br>all of that but uh I I I I heard from my<br>families and I read some books and it's<br>quite uh emotional and then as you said<br>and and inspiring<br>and so much uh suffering in in in that<br>well okay well I think we can end then<br>do you want to give them a heads up<br>about tomorrow well uh tomorrow uh I'll<br>be talking about uh 1979 ordinations in<br>Camp Cambodia which is<br>um uh a controversial topic and<br>um and also recently there's been a lot<br>of uh Facebook activities discussing<br>this whole issue there are some new<br>photographs that I'd never seen before<br>who that are now in circulation so<br>I um so anyway that's will be the topic<br>for tomorrow uh uh some research I did<br>about the<br>1979 ordination that is the the process<br>where Cambodia returned to the monastic<br>lineage following the period in the<br>popot period when<br>the when the monastic lineage was<br>interrupted<br>so okay well thank you everyone for your<br>participation and we'll see people<br>tomorrow thank you okay I guess I I'm<br>here<br>that</p></main><footer
