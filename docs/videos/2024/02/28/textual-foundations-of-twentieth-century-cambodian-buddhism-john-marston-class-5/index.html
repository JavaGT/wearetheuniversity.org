sending<br>that specific to me oh something<br>okay Angela is not here okay but Pro is<br>here and that's two well let's let's get<br>started uh and so thank you all for your<br>presence during this week and I've I<br>once again thank you to uh the<br>department and Elizabeth Guthrie for<br>inviting me here and this is uh this has<br>gone well I think and I'm I really feel<br>privileged to be able to be here and so<br>should thank de too and thanks to<br>Deary as well<br>um<br>and um so today<br>is somewhat different kind of talk in<br>that it's more contemporary than the<br>previous talks and I'll be talking today<br>about Cambodian connections to India and<br>Sri Lanka at the present time and this<br>was actually my original research before<br>I began to shift to the work the<br>historical work about Cambodian monks in<br>India before 19<br>75 um and they're really three related<br>phenomenon here and in a way these three<br>phenomenon could each be a a study in<br>itself and this is um<br>maybe my putting them together may not<br>always work but I I think there's a<br>point of looking at them as<br>interconnected and these three<br>phenomenon are um<br>Cambodian temples in India and Sri Lanka<br>and Cambodian monks who are in India and<br>Sri Lanka some as students and the third<br>is um pilgrimage groups uh uh that is to<br>say Buddhist tourism groups and so<br>um I'm going to start out with um a<br>video now the luxury of these talks has<br>been that we have so much time and this<br>has been good and bad perhaps uh because<br>I've had so much time I usually when I<br>give talks I try to condense them and<br>this time i' I've had the luxury of of<br>going on and and maybe that has been a<br>bit much at times but so because we have<br>the time I thought we'd look at this<br>video and um as I told you last time<br>there are<br>um there are YouTube videos of Cambodian<br>pil uh pilgrimage groups going to India<br>and Sri Lanka uh there are all sorts of<br>videos of this kind and I focused on one<br>particular group there was a series of<br>like more than 10 videos and it happened<br>that one of the leaders of the group<br>whose name is put was was a Cambodian L<br>uh Buddhist leader who I was interested<br>in and so um<br>instead of trying to look at every every<br>pilgrimage video on that's on YouTube I<br>focused on these and uh some of it is<br>rather boring but there were times when<br>when I found it quite dramatic and so<br>here's a video of a Cambodian pilgrimage<br>group at kusaga kusaga is this is the<br>place where the Buddha passed away where<br>the Buddha uh died and<br>uh entered Nirvana so let's hope that<br>this works the technical people have<br>been helping<br>me and this is about 10 minutes so let's<br>thinge spee<br>spee<br>come camb from cambi<br>temp they're followed by l l women most<br>the participants in these pilage groups<br>there's usually more women<br>than often middle AG older women uh<br>well<br>think go of you know this Buddhist flag<br>of in the<br>spee for speech<br>speech for<br>speech spe foreign<br>speech<br>foree<br>spe<br>spe<br>foree<br>foree<br>another<br>foree<br>foreign spee foreign speech foreign for<br>speech<br>foreign<br>speech speech speech foreign<br>speech<br>foreign foreign<br>speech foreign<br>for spee foreign speech<br>speech foreign speech<br>foreign<br>speech foreign speech<br>speech foreign speech speech foreign<br>foreign forign spee<br>speech fore speech foreign foreign<br>speeech<br>speech<br>foreign<br>speech is<br>speeech foreign speech for speech<br>foreign<br>speech foreign foreign<br>foreign speech foreign speech foreign<br>fore fore foreign fore forch foreign<br>speech<br>speech foreign foreign<br>speech foreign speech foreign<br>speech<br>foreign speech foreign foreign spe<br>speech speech spech<br>fore foreign<br>foreign okay maybe that's I think that's<br>the end anyway I for some reason of the<br>videos in this YouTube videos this was a<br>section that was for some reason seemed<br>particularly beautiful and moving to me<br>and the people participating in the in<br>the ceremon obviously were very much<br>caught up in the experience and it was<br>it was an emotional experience for them<br>and an experience of of reverence to<br>them and this is of course by no means<br>um more Cambodian than it is any other<br>group that uh groups from many different<br>countries are coming to India and<br>participating in this kind of of<br>ceremony and in fact the organizers<br>probably uh the Indian organizers are<br>probably in some sense giving an<br>indication of how this this ceremony<br>might be performed in ways that are<br>consistent with what other groups were<br>performed so okay let me see now the<br>trick is to<br>um to find my<br>other other<br>uh<br>um my other PowerPoint<br>um<br>okay and here's my the primary<br>PowerPoint which I'm going to use today<br>um and um and um<br>and incidentally um one of the one of<br>our video participants is a cambodi mon<br>who is in India now so um this should<br>have uh I we may not want to comment<br>while I'm giving this uh talk but so I'm<br>very much aware that uh what I'm going<br>to present is my own observation and my<br>own interpretation and there may be<br>other ways of looking this as well um uh<br>so um I was just in India recently for<br>three weeks to do uh research my<br>research is finally Focus focused on the<br>things we talked about previous L um the<br>monks who were Cambodia monks who were<br>in in who were in India prior to the war<br>prior to 1975 but<br>inevitably I I spent my time in<br>Cambodian temples that's where I was<br>primarily staying and so the kind of<br>things I'm going to talk about today are<br>things that I was experiencing fairly<br>recently now the talk I'm giving today<br>is mostly based on an our a talk I wrote<br>uh several years ago and um which was<br>published in Spanish language and it has<br>not been published in<br>English and I would like to someday<br>publish this in English and hopefully<br>I I as I go over it I think that there<br>are a lot of things I would want to not<br>just update but perhaps rethink and<br>reorganize um but we'll see how that<br>will do as I give this paper and every<br>I'm going to rely on what I wrote<br>previously but we'll try to interject<br>some observations where I see things<br>that have changed<br>um um and as I say that well one reason<br>for including this today is that um in<br>in so far as I'm been trying to talk<br>about text that um here I'm mostly<br>drawing on my personal obser ations and<br>on my interviews but here just to<br>mention that these videos that we saw<br>are also a form of text and and I<br>believe in the case of Anushka you'll be<br>drawing heavily on social media for for<br>your work and so keep in mind that when<br>we think of text in the broadest sense<br>text is not just manuscript texts or<br>books But it includes things like the<br>video we just saw which which provide<br>their own own window uh especially into<br>things that are happening at the present<br>time um and one thing I perhaps do not<br>emphasize efficiently is that um the<br>participants themselves are very much<br>involved in in videos and social media<br>in fact as I as I've just been traveling<br>in the past three weeks I make new<br>Facebook friends I I see postings<br>relevant to the things I interested on<br>on Facebook on other types of social<br>media itself so this is an<br>ongoing uh that in the Contemporary<br>world uh this thing is experienced by me<br>through social media but it's also<br>experienced by the people the<br>participants themselves the monks the<br>lay persons persons coming and going<br>from the temples are themselves very<br>much involved in Social Media email<br>various different kinds of of texts and<br>this becomes part of the whole<br>experience that we're talking about<br>um<br>um um so how does this where relate to<br>my earlier talks well obviously the two<br>talks I gave about India prior to 1975<br>but Cambodian monks in India are are<br>related in some way they're talking<br>about the the first talk I gave was on<br>davar Maha is about sort of one of the<br>first Cambodian monks to to be in India<br>uh the second the third talk I gave<br>about Asia foundation in India was also<br>about about Cambodian monks and other<br>monks in India they these are the people<br>who lay the ground work for what what<br>we're talking about some of the a few of<br>the Cambodia monks who were in India<br>prior to the war stay and they played a<br>role in founding the temples that exists<br>today as we'll see<br>um um<br>so I'm also have been involved in all my<br>work on historical conjunction moments<br>of historical transition and so that's<br>another way in which this connects with<br>my previous work we had<br>three papers which were concerned with<br>the this moment in history after in the<br>50s and the 60s the the post<br>Independence period which also relates<br>to to the Cold War as we said and which<br>relates as well to um to the Buddha<br>gianti celebrations which took place in<br>in 1956 and<br>57 the paper last week is also at a<br>historical conjunction it's a moment of<br>change the end of the pole poot period<br>when things changed dramatically in<br>Cambodia and perhaps what we're talking<br>about today is also a continuous<br>continuation of that but it happens to<br>be things that were primarily taking<br>place after 1990 and what happened in<br>the 90s is that Cambodia after a period<br>of uh a period perod of war and a<br>socialist government in the<br>1980s made a transition uh through a<br>United Nations Mission and United<br>Nations sponsored elections to a<br>different kind of political system a<br>different kind of economic system and at<br>that moment the country began to open up<br>to the wider world and it was in this<br>context that for the first time in many<br>years Cambodian monks be began to feel<br>free to go and study in foreign<br>countries and that had something to do<br>with what was happening in the kinds of<br>things we're talking about here<br>um<br>um okay well I'm going to give my paper<br>proper now and um uh<br>um<br>so<br>we're dealing with these three<br>phenomenon Cambodian monks going to<br>study in the<br>countries pilgrimage tourist groups<br>visiting sacred sites in the building of<br>Cambodian style temples these pilgrimage<br>is the financial support of student<br>monks and fundraising for tiple projects<br>all involve not only cambodians from<br>Cambodia proper but the wider diaspora<br>community in Europe the United States<br>and AUST Australia so the<br>transnationalism of the phenomenon<br>phenomena has its own triangular<br>complexities thus in less than 20 years<br>now 30 years we have 12 or more<br>Cambodian temples in India and one in<br>Sri Lanka and when I first wrote this<br>paper there were 100 Cambodian monks<br>studying in each country and Cambodian<br>Buddhists traveling in pilgrimage groups<br>several times a<br>year so in this paper I'm going to try<br>to see how that happened and what it<br>means in in Social terms in an earlier<br>version of this paper and I'm I still<br>find this idea fascinating uh although I<br>wonder if it's changed now I I emphasize<br>the idea of transnational Merit making<br>um Merit making in Southeast Asia is a<br>social project and realized in a social<br>context one which takes on an added<br>Dimension We performed across National<br>lines so I'm going to speak of<br>activities of cambodians with varying<br>degrees of intensity and purity of<br>intention pursue religious meaning in a<br>transnational Buddhist<br>context um there are individual stories<br>here and part of what I want to convey<br>is the drama of<br>individuals negotiating their way in new<br>circumstances again I'm using this word<br>negoti in which which in all of my work<br>I'm interested in this process of how<br>individual persons sort of find their<br>way negotiate their way in new<br>circumstances<br>um but I'm P principally concerned with<br>a Buddhist setting in which Buddhist<br>communities extend communal practices<br>across National bounders<br>borders and create new institutions the<br>pursuit of Buddhist meaning includes the<br>pursuit of Education and devotional<br>practices of religious<br>pilgrimage in some case it entailed<br>bringing Buddhist relics from Shri Lanka<br>or India back to Cambodia or to<br>Cambodian diaspora temples this is an<br>aspect which I don't go into detail here<br>but is<br>actually one of the more interesting<br>things that the coming and going of<br>pilgrimage also involves um relics again<br>the circulation of of relics<br>um<br>uh um<br>and<br>um and it can entail a commitment to<br>establish a symbolic Cambodian Buddhist<br>presence in a foreign<br>country it is true that whether or not<br>is always conceived as Mar making<br>donation and everything that implies in<br>religious ter social terms figures<br>prominently in these project<br>projects institutional and personal<br>contribution to monks educational<br>personal<br>contributions enabling other persons to<br>make religious pilgrimage as well as the<br>fact that in the context of Cambodian<br>Buddhism pilgrimage invariably involves<br>donation specifically when as it's<br>organized around K 10 ceremonies um uh<br>most of the people here today know what<br>katin is katin is a<br>ceremony following<br>the the rainy season retreats in<br>which uh monks robes and other materials<br>are donated to temples and so some of<br>the pilgrimage groups are organized<br>um temple building is a project of<br>donation on an even larger<br>scale<br>um the phenomenon of these different<br>ways of pursuing religious meaning as<br>they occur transnationally entails its<br>own set of intensities complexities and<br>risks as we know border crossing<br>generates consciousness of difference as<br>well as new<br>solidarities<br>Andrew Walker writes with reference to a<br>very different contexts and it's on the<br>screen here connections and flows of<br>goods information and people between<br>places are problematic they generate<br>advantage and disadvantage they're often<br>the subject of dispute and they're<br>regularly the subject of intervention<br>they're an important Sphere for the<br>exercise of power um there's an economic<br>Dimension to the kind of phenomena we<br>are looking at here there is an economic<br>calculus factoring into the cost and<br>benefits of determining where and how<br>monk studies where pilgrimage groups<br>go and where temples are built and<br>differences between economies underly<br>the flow of people and<br>funds sometimes enabling religious<br>donation that would not otherwise take<br>place increasingly there are wealthy<br>classes in Cambodia itself so it is not<br>all only the wealth of the Cambodian<br>diaspora that drives these projects but<br>that's a factor and and one thing I<br>didn't mention in the video uh is that<br>the pilgrimage group that we watched in<br>the video it seemed to been organized by<br>an Australian uh a Cambodian couple<br>resid in Australia um and so you had<br>some of the participants in the<br>pilgrimage group were from Australia but<br>others were coming directly from<br>Cambodia and so um that's part of the<br>dynamic that in the context we're<br>talking about we see a<br>combination of<br>of support and<br>participation from both the cambodians<br>in Cambodia and cambodians in and<br>Cambodian communities of the United<br>States Europe and Australia probably New<br>Zealand um yeah they pilgrimages that go<br>from new<br>sh<br>um although my research only touches on<br>it tangentially also recognize that<br>government<br>policies for student visas tourism and<br>the context under which foreigners can<br>own or Manage Property are also<br>significant factor coming into<br>play uh actually on my most recent visit<br>to India When I visit these temples<br>actually now that I know these monks<br>better I I I hear stories about how<br>temples can be owned how what is the<br>what is the process whereby in India uh<br>a a quote Cambodian Buddhist temple can<br>be can be instituted with Indian<br>authorities and how and invariably it<br>needs<br>Indian uh the participant of Indian<br>citizens uh a as well as uh religious<br>figures who may be of Cambodian origin<br>and so even the the<br>legal uh framework whereby a Cambodian<br>temple in India can exist can be quite<br>complicated and can change over time<br>uh at a more conceptual level we can<br>speak of quote transnational imagination<br>uh<br>um that is most of all a religious<br>imagination which gives symbolic value<br>to some sites is more purely<br>Buddhist transnational imagination both<br>transcends and relies on conceptions of<br>nation the phenomena I look at draw on<br>and contribute to institutions of quote<br>International<br>Buddhism and to International Buddhism<br>as a concept um they also have<br>underlined in some way refocused<br>understanding of how Buddhism is<br>associated with national identity thus<br>for example for Sri Lankan<br>Buddhists rescuing Cambodian Buddhism<br>may be related to their own project of<br>Buddhist nationalism and this gets into<br>complex things which I'm sure I would<br>like to talk about with Anushka um well<br>at the same time Cambodian Buddhist and<br>Shri Lan and India are motivated to<br>rectify the invisibility of camp B<br>Buddhism and see it recognized as one of<br>the important Buddhism of the world um<br>questions of how Buddhism relates ethnic<br>and national identity grow even more<br>complex when we take into consideration<br>the role of diaspora May in these<br>processes that is cambodians who have<br>gone to live in in forn countries<br>um cambodians who are searching for and<br>asserting their identity as cambodians<br>and as Buddhists in countries of<br>residence where they are minority<br>um okay I'm I'm going to use my<br>published paper and I'm going to talk<br>about the situation in India and Sri<br>Lanka although I realize that for some<br>of you this is very obvious these are<br>very obvious things um in Sri Lanka we<br>find a setting where terat Buddhism is<br>the religion of the dominant ethnic<br>group and<br>institutionalized as the country's<br>official religion it is likewise a<br>country where because of Buddhist<br>historical Rule and the opposition to<br>British<br>colonialism together with the<br>significant presence of populations<br>practicing other religions there have<br>been particularly strong politicized<br>movements affirming Buddhism as a<br>religion it is a country with an active<br>tradition of Buddhist missionary work in<br>foreign countries of a that has never<br>significantly developed in for example<br>Cambodia this relates in terms to<br>openness to foreign Buddhist monks<br>studying in Sri Lanka although a small<br>number of Cambodian monks studied in Sri<br>Lanka prior to<br>1975 there is no continuity between<br>these monks and the newer waves of<br>student monks instead Cambodian monks<br>began going to Sri<br>Lanka in the<br>1990s because of the interest of<br>powerful Street Lankan Buddhist monks<br>and Buddhist intellectuals with prior<br>connection to<br>Cambodia in contrast in India which is<br>of course the historical birthplace of<br>Buddhism Buddhism is from the<br>perspective of the country as a whole<br>fairly peripheral although it has<br>undergone Revival at since at least the<br>1950s among certain segments of the<br>population it is in part the<br>institutions arising in the context of<br>that Revival and the Indian States<br>willingness for them to exist which<br>provide the context for Cambodian monks<br>currently going to study in India<br>whereas Sri Lanka has a tradition of<br>Buddhist missionary work India has been<br>at different times and places the object<br>of Buddhist missionary work by Sri<br>Lankans as well as others this is one<br>factor in the presence of born Buddhist<br>temples at sites associated with the<br>life of the Buddha which have also been<br>developed as pilgrimage sites for<br>foreign Buddhist<br>while be misleading to call Cambodian<br>Buddhist missionaries to India the<br>presence of Cambodian monks and pilgrims<br>relates to this larger phenomenon a<br>Buddhist pilgrimage and missionization<br>from other<br>countries May monks began going to India<br>for study as early as the<br>1950s as we saw in our previous talk at<br>about the same time that monks and<br>layers were encouraged to visit India in<br>the context of the<br>1956 Buddha gianti celebrations and the<br>fact that a handful of May monks and ex<br>monks were still in<br>India uh after the popt period and into<br>the 90s provides a significant<br>continuity for Cambodian Buddhists who<br>1990s um well here I have some maps and<br>I think probably everybody here knows<br>where these countries are um um but<br>um uh you can<br>see<br>um well I I think we all know where Sri<br>Lanka is um but in the case of India<br>perhaps it's significant to point out<br>that the areas we're talking about are<br>in the are the the sites of<br>sacred uh uh the sacred sites of<br>Buddhism so they're they're in the<br>northeast of they in the northeast<br>of of India primarily in the provinces<br>of the states of biar and odar Pradesh<br>and there's also a Cambodian temple in<br>Delhi<br>um okay I'm going to start by talking<br>about Cambodian monks going to Sri Lanka<br>in the 1990s um<br>Cambodian monks began going to Sri Lanka<br>with Sri Lankan sponsorship at the time<br>Cambodia and I said uh<br>that in the<br>19 N that popot period was from 1975 to<br>1979 and then during the 80s as we saw<br>to a degree in the and the lecture<br>yesterday uh was a period of um it was a<br>socialist government it had strong ties<br>to Vietnam it was called The People's<br>Republic of campuchia and there was a<br>resistance movement on the border at the<br>same time uh all of which played itself<br>out in relationship to different ideas<br>about<br>Buddhism um in in the early 90s there<br>was uh a peace agreement between the<br>groups the resistant groups on the<br>border and the plumin government and<br>this resulted in a un<br>Mission uh in uh in where the peace<br>agreement was signed in 1991 October<br>1991 and the UN mission was in uh 1992<br>and 93 uh so we're talking about<br>Transformations that took place in<br>Cambodia in the context of a United<br>Nations mission<br>um it was in the context of negotiating<br>leading up to the mission that Cambodian<br>State policies toward Buddhism<br>liberalized in 1989 following several<br>years of tighter socialist controls and<br>as we talked about<br>ordination after 1979<br>for uh at for most of the 80s the only<br>legal monks were men over 50 years old<br>although in remote areas there can then<br>to be many younger men who ordained his<br>monks so so it was um what was legal and<br>what was actually happening practice for<br>two different things but in 1989 the law<br>began to change and younger Cambodian<br>men could once again ordain its monks<br>under certain<br>circumstances<br>um large numbers ordained many going to<br>pumpin<br>in newly reopened Buddhist<br>schools a British educated SRI lanan<br>scholar of Buddhism HMA Gatti laki was a<br>conspicuous presence in Cambodia at this<br>time we see her picture in the upper<br>left hand corner what just looking yes<br>um she has been she and her husband have<br>been very uh conspicuous um<br>intellectuals in the country uh<br>ha gattii worked first for the United<br>Nations later for the hinr bull<br>Foundation she actively promoted<br>Cambodian Buddhist institutions<br>including the newly revived Buddhist<br>Institute and the association of nuns<br>and lay women she's closely identified<br>with the first groups of Cambodian mons<br>going to Sri Lanka having organized an<br>examination to choose candidates in<br>coordination with a Ministry of religion<br>although a Sri Lankan Economist and I<br>did not know this for a while um um<br>working in Cambodia for the Asian<br>development Bank Roger corali and I<br>apologize if I'm pronouncing names<br>correct and you see Roger Kali in the<br>left uh in the picture on the lower left<br>corner um he should be mentioned for<br>also having brought<br>two um small groups of of Buddhist<br>monster Sri Lanka and installed them in<br>the famous gangaramaya temple in Columbo<br>the first arriving a few weeks before<br>the first monks organized by HMA Gatti<br>laki HMA Gatti laki describes her role<br>as quote facilitating the sponsorship of<br>Cambodian monks by Sri Lankan monks a<br>first group selected on the basis of an<br>exam administered by the ministry of<br>religion was sponsored by<br>venerable mapala Gama vilara uh who<br>another name that um anuska doubtly<br>knows better than I do um and you see<br>his his picture in the uh in in the<br>center<br>um uh a second group of primarily<br>younger monks two years later was<br>divided into three sites of provincial<br>temples and a third group of four monks<br>in 99 accompanied venerable omal<br>soito who we see in the right hand<br>picture uh when he returned from<br>Cambodia to his Temple at ellip ptia the<br>Shri Lankan monks and intellectuals<br>involved in bringing the early monks to<br>Sri Lanka are each in their own way<br>Larger than Life figures with<br>multifaceted careers their sponsorship<br>stemmed from a concern for the future of<br>Cambodian<br>Buddhism as it related more generally to<br>their profound devotion Buddhism a<br>devotion which in the case of haati<br>and venerable Soo has included a<br>controversial element of Buddhist<br>nationalism uh of the San and temples<br>housing the first Cambodia blocks the<br>three I've been able to visit are<br>extremely different in style and<br>orientation from each other the<br>spectacular gangaramaya Temple a common<br>tourist destination in the heart of<br>colomba the more aere but historically<br>important Parma damama Ceta in the<br>suburbs of Colombia and the more distant<br>bodh Raja vhar Viara Temple of Venable<br>amalo in the mountain town of Emilia<br>with programs environmental and social<br>Outreach what they have in common is<br>strong International links including<br>active programs of<br>missionization they also have in common<br>the leadership of particularly strong<br>monks venerable<br>pod h hamuro of gangar a temple is is<br>one of the highest profile monks in the<br>country again I this is an article I<br>wrote several years ago I do not know<br>the current status of most of these<br>monks vable Mama pasara a colorful<br>somewhat eccentric<br>figure was in his lifetime perhaps best<br>known in Sri Lanka as an artist m uh but<br>also held high positions in several<br>International Buddhist organizations<br>he visited Cambodia in the 1960s and ear<br>and again in the early<br>1980s when cambodia's recovering from<br>the popot period a visit probably<br>connected to his prominence in an<br>organization called the Asian Buddhist<br>Council for peace a Buddhist<br>organization based in mol m Mongolia<br>which stressed the participants<br>participation of Buddhist from socialist<br>countries um I believe although I<br>haven't been able to prove it that the<br>ordinate the night September 1979<br>ordination ceremony which we talked<br>about yesterday was that this<br>organization the Asian Buddhist Council<br>for peace played a role in bringing<br>together the monks who were involved in<br>that ceremony although this is something<br>that seems to make sense given who is<br>involved or they have not been able to<br>prove that vable omal soat Tero one of<br>the founders of the jatia<br>Sanka uh<br>sea again I apologize for my<br>pronunciation is a political party made<br>up of monks is and I think this is still<br>the case U but was the case when I<br>visited Sri Lanka one of the most<br>visible of politically active monks in<br>Sri<br>Lanka he worked for the United Nations<br>Cambodia in the late 1990s on a project<br>in cooperation with the Cambodian<br>minister envir he is also the founder of<br>a Buddhist Association in<br>Singapore uh the early projects to bring<br>Cambodia monks to the country with Sri<br>Lankan sponsorship was by no means by no<br>means ran smoothly um I can recall when<br>I first met HMA<br>gunatilake in the early 2000s before I<br>was doing this kind of research I<br>remember expressing some disappointment<br>in<br>conversation and some of the monks and<br>EXP monks interviewed for this study<br>were Franken calling these programs they<br>even use the word a<br>failure um and less than half the monks<br>actually completed degrees and most<br>ended up leaving the monkhood with many<br>now having little to do with Buddhism uh<br>nevertheless uh you have to balance this<br>with the fact that there were also some<br>dramatic Su successes um and again there<br>things have changed since I I wrote this<br>paper but um four of the<br>monks at the time I wrote this paper uh<br>were uh and two of them had already<br>become Layman a third one has also<br>become a layman in a very dramatic case<br>were professors at the pr Raja Buddhist<br>University in Cambodia<br>um the one and I don't know how much to<br>go into detail about this these are<br>monks who are are are people I know who<br>in this case I I would almost use the<br>word friend uh the one who was the reor<br>of the Buddhist University and the vice<br>Rector and<br>then um after achieving a very high rank<br>uh in Buddhism recently uh left the<br>monkhood in in something that has very<br>much been discussed in Cambodia um uh<br>and he still has a very prominent role<br>in Cambodian Affairs um another one uh<br>who completed his Doctorate in<br>Cambodia when I first wrote this paper<br>was his Deputy he did postdoctor work in<br>at Harvard um and now he has the role<br>that his uh colleague had as Vice recor<br>of the Buddhist University and also now<br>has the title of Sam d uh um at least<br>one other former monk from the group is<br>a high ranking official in the minister<br>ofin another who completed<br>um and Ma in Lankan is<br>um when I did this Reger was an<br>administrator at a private university<br>and this is to say<br>that<br>the and you know as I do this as I meet<br>Cambodian monks and lay person studied<br>in foreign University it's we have to<br>recognize that it's simply difficult to<br>be a foreign student uh studying in any<br>University and these early programs were<br>Rocky um not everybody succeeded but<br>some succeeded very well<br>um while in Sri Lanka there's<br>expectation that monks will ordain for<br>Life the percentage of the early student<br>monks whove stayed in the monkhood after<br>studying Sri Lanka is probably higher<br>than the codian average for those<br>staying in the monk<br>Hood um and the early sponsorship of<br>monks was also successful to the degree<br>that it created a groundwork for<br>subsequent waves of monks going to<br>study these early Sri Lankan sponsored<br>monks came when Cambodia was emerging<br>from isolation with minimum<br>International experience in relatively<br>low levels of Education in English there<br>was no early generation of Cambodian<br>student monks to show them the ropes<br>coming from a country emerging from war<br>and political isolation they were<br>completely dependent on their sponsors<br>they face cultural shock including<br>difficulty adjusting to the highly<br>spiced Sri Lankan foods and situations<br>where they had no control over the diet<br>one of the first to return to Cambodia<br>complain of stomach problems caused by<br>this and I I don't want to laugh above<br>this but actually this is a a theme that<br>comes up again and again of Cambodia<br>monks and perhaps lay people who go to<br>Sri Lanka and India to study they have<br>trouble with the they have trouble with<br>the spicy spicy food or I I I can't food<br>can be spicy as well but it's spicy in<br>different ways<br>um<br>um one monk went so far to say that the<br>monks in all the temples had problems<br>with their sponsoring Abbotts this is no<br>doubt related to the fact that the monks<br>in their 20s were typically expected to<br>study at the elementary level of of much<br>younger monks while they blanced at<br>doing this they were regarded as<br>undisciplined or uncooperative<br>uh<br>um it may be true that some monks came<br>to Sri Lanka more motivated to study<br>English and obtain University degrees<br>than to pursue a religious vocation<br>however it's also true that some Who<br>removed themselves from the authority of<br>their sponsors were among those able to<br>achieve the greatest levels of success<br>uh when HMA gatak brought a second group<br>of 10 monks to Sri Lanka in<br>1996 the selection process was partially<br>made of Sri Lankan monks she recently<br>brought to teach in Cambodia um perhaps<br>would address some of the problems that<br>had Arisen with the earlier group that<br>they selected younger monks only one of<br>biku and of the novices one 17 years old<br>and the rest 15 years old or younger<br>they were sent to three different<br>provincial towns this group also had<br>dramatic failures within the most<br>disastrous case one some child monks<br>fleeing their temples and making their<br>way to Columbo eventually returning to<br>Cambodia the strategy of bringing child<br>monks did have some successes though to<br>uh two of the child monks who came at<br>this time another very young monk who<br>came later as part of the group<br>sponsored by vable omal<br>biso uh um stayed in Sri Lanka they were<br>still there when I recently wrote this<br>article um integrated fully into the<br>culture learned SES well enough to study<br>in SES medium schools and completed<br>Advanced degrees one who<br>was um became quite close to V Soo um is<br>now uh back in Cambodia uh teaching<br>meditation<br>to primarily to westerners in who are in<br>Cambodia at a very prominent prominent<br>Meditation Center um with older monks a<br>significant point of tension was they<br>were required to study for long periods<br>in the the Pena system that is the<br>traditional Seminary like education for<br>young monks and did not see any path<br>opening up to proceed to the university<br>system many of the first monks never got<br>beyond the stage before returning to<br>Cambodia even though as the English<br>teacher to several of the monks told me<br>those who managed to enter the<br>university all<br>succeeded three monks two from parad<br>dama Ceta and one from bodh Raja Viara<br>took the DraStic step of breaking with<br>their sponsoring Abbot returning to<br>Cambodia and then returning to Sri Lanka<br>on their own and this phrase on their<br>own uh is what I use in this article and<br>um and and uh another uh a Cambodian uh<br>scholar who's worked on the issue of<br>Cambodian monks in India uh has used the<br>word self Finance uh and so there's a<br>difference in that there are are monks<br>who go with a<br>sponsor uh the C the Sri Lankan or<br>Indian government and then there are<br>those who find their own funding to go<br>on their own initiative and so when I<br>say on their own that's what I'm talking<br>about<br>um and actually these who left and came<br>back with their own financing with their<br>own arranging their own strategy of<br>study these were the most successful<br>monks um when these monks returned to<br>Sri Lanka they brought other monks with<br>them who also came to study on their own<br>in effect ushering a new wave of<br>Cambodia monks going to Sri Lanka<br>without any Sri Lankan<br>sponsorship where the phrase on their<br>own or self finances used by monks and<br>former monks in Sri Lanka it indicates<br>there's no institutional sponsorship<br>from Sri Lanka or elsewhere and neither<br>the Cambodian Ministry of religion or<br>any other authoritative body was<br>involved in selection it does not<br>necessarily mean they came without<br>financial support an increasing number<br>of monks<br>um as it it it it becomes harder and<br>harder to make generalization some came<br>with family support some had accumulated<br>enough from donations to purchase<br>airfare some had the support of their<br>home temples in Cambodia some found<br>individual cambodians from Cambodia from<br>overseas Cambodian communities who were<br>willing to support them thus new kinds<br>of transnational donation began coming<br>to the<br>four<br>um Hill economics entered in as well as<br>the fact that at a certain point<br>donation for monks overseas education<br>began to capture the imagination of<br>donors this occurred at a time when<br>Cambodia was opening up to the world in<br>a more General way and an economic logic<br>of capitalism with Aid and Aid was<br>kicking in at the same time diaspora May<br>began to have more connections with<br>their home country than in the Socialist<br>period it also corresponds to the time<br>when Cambodian began to go<br>on their own to India by this time<br>Cambodian monks would have had somewhat<br>higher levels of Buddhist education in<br>English this also facilitated the<br>transition once they arrived in Sri<br>Lanka monks found places to reside and<br>prepared themselves to take Examination<br>for entry into<br>universities they found it relatively<br>easy for monks to get Sri Lankan visas<br>to<br>study one former monk even said that<br>once the price of airfare was cut<br>it was cheaper to study as a monk in Sri<br>Lanka than in Cambodia especially for<br>monk studying at the Buddhist and po<br>University which reduced the regular<br>tuition for<br>cambodians<br>um<br>um and<br>I'm I'm going to skip over some things<br>I'm gonna there's a section here about<br>the creation of of an association and<br>um although months going on their own<br>continues the present time and I haven't<br>been back to Sri Lanka in quite a while<br>but I although I do follow the uh cambod<br>and Temple on their Facebook page<br>um um I believe that this pattern<br>continues to the present time although<br>institutional funding material I again<br>in 19 2007 with college provided by a<br>Buddhist education assistant project<br>called keep keep is a small NGO begun in<br>the 1990 camp in the camps on the Tha<br>Cambodian border primarily the project<br>of one man at Peter<br>galop galop has been able to give modest<br>scholarships to Cambodian studying at<br>the Buddhist University in pen in 2007<br>it obtained co-funding with the KET<br>Foundation uh a foundation to typically<br>more oriented to Tibetan Buddhism to<br>provide a small number of scholarships<br>for Cambodian monks studying at the ma<br>and doctoral levels in Sri<br>Lanka there were six recipients at the<br>time I visited Sri Lanka in<br>2014 recipients I've chosen by the staff<br>at the Buddhist University in pluma and<br>commit themselves to teaching there for<br>a time after completing degrees it has<br>provide proved successful enabling<br>advanced studies for a number of<br>talented monks some who had completed<br>the at the Buddhist University in plumen<br>some who studied previously in Burma and<br>some who had first gone to Sri Lanka on<br>their own and were successful enough<br>academically continuing a program of<br>this<br>kind<br>um um one of the most successful scholar<br>recips venerable Lun<br>li who completed a doctorate in Sanskrit<br>went to Sri Lanka as a teenager and a<br>second group of students organized by<br>Amma Gatti lak<br>um um I believe there may have been at<br>least uh two or three cambodians who've<br>completed and doctorates in Sri Lanka<br>um<br>okay oh well here's just which I should<br>have shown you early here is some of the<br>um the issues of that we talked about<br>before um adjust Foods culture what<br>monks perceive as authoritarian in in<br>Sri Lanka Temple sub tensions having to<br>do with the fact that Cambodian monks<br>who grown men were Maj to stud with Sri<br>Lanka novice were still<br>children um and perhaps an attempt to<br>resolve these problems later Cambodian<br>monks chose to go chosen to go to Sri<br>Lanka were younger and place in temples<br>further away from the city with mix<br>results um again this this whole issue<br>of monks going on their own self Finance<br>what what did that mean and it it was a<br>a sort of transformation and for a while<br>was uh in both Sri Lanka and India was<br>was an important pattern uh uh in India<br>that seems to be decreasing in recent<br>years so now we'll got talk about India<br>uh and uh in India and this relates in<br>part to things we've been talking about<br>in previous<br>sessions in India the pattern of monks<br>going to study is much more deeply<br>linked to pilgrimage and temple building<br>that it has been in Sri<br>Lanka again these are three separate<br>phenomenon student monks Cambodia<br>pilgrimage groups the sacred sites in<br>the building of Cambodian style temples<br>in India each have their own Dynamic<br>sometimes totally<br>unrelated but in practice they are often<br>linked and typically share a common<br>momentum the current wave of cambod<br>amongst going for study in India began<br>somewhat later than in Sri Lanka in 1998<br>but because there're more explicit links<br>to what happened before the popot period<br>the history in a sense goes back further<br>the story of Cambodia monks who went to<br>India prior to<br>1975 is itself an intriguing topic which<br>I've talked about a bit in my previous<br>lecture<br>um for the purpose of the study four<br>figures stand out um the vable Maha eapo<br>often referred to Simply as venerable PR<br>um um venerable MOA Paul Dr sambe and Mr<br>kma venerable PR is perhaps the single<br>most important figure it's the monk who<br>you see on the left<br>um uh having never left the monkhood and<br>having founded two temples um uh he had<br>I think he came up before in our<br>discussion because when he first went to<br>India he was identified more as a time<br>um uh he had gone to Bangkok from batong<br>Western Cambodia as a novice in the<br>19 30s uh I I believe actually<br>he um by the time he went he he was<br>actually a beu and was based at wat pole<br>before going to India and in<br>1956 in part to study but also as part<br>of a Buddhist missionization project or<br>perhaps as a pilgrim actually I on this<br>most recent trip to to India I did ask<br>why did he go why did he go in 1956 and<br>actually people said they didn't quite<br>know um um<br>he<br>uh um he had a typ passport in the early<br>years when he was there the first temple<br>that he founded<br>at stasti something pronounced<br>saati uh which was consecrated in 1988<br>it the building of it began early was<br>originally considered Thai and relied<br>heavily for its original support from<br>contribution made by the lay community<br>of wato and Bangkok um was only um near<br>the time of his death and the late 1990s<br>that it began to assume an identity as<br>as Kare um it is still commonly used by<br>Thai pilgrimage groups the New Deli<br>Temple was created in<br>1994 at the site of a former Medical<br>Clinic in merali within walking distance<br>of the show commission that we talked<br>about uh<br>earlier ven purer had obtained a<br>diplomatic passport from Cambodia in<br>1993<br>and the temple was more clearly from its<br>Inception I anyway from very early on uh<br>I was told that the temple in New Delhi<br>also had a lot of Thai<br>funding and um and the<br>decision to make it<br>Cambodian well it occurred before the<br>SEMA ceremony was put in<br>place um but<br>uh but there was a certain point where<br>in a somewhat controversial way he he<br>publicly announced that it would be<br>considered a Cambodian Tempo V perer who<br>died in 2002 had a higher level of<br>Buddhist education that many of the<br>Cambodian Ms who came later um he said<br>to have a level four and the poly exams<br>in Thailand but nevertheless he was<br>known for the intensity his Force<br>meditation and<br>Supernatural quote Supernatural<br>capacities said to achieve while<br>meditating in Himalayas in the 19 60s um<br>I was told that um on this most recent<br>trip that he he practiced yoga as well<br>as budh meditation uh he was a um he was<br>a he was very very interesting unusual<br>monk he's often remembered as a magic<br>monk um such as in his Effectiveness and<br>confering Power<br>by by water blessing this may be one of<br>the reasons he was successful in<br>generating funds for his Temple um K<br>Pama and Dr s have been closely<br>connected over the years now K Pama is<br>the second person there and actually<br>he's of these four people is the only<br>one who's still alive um and I I made a<br>trip to visit him uh uh and he's in a<br>rather remote area of of India in sasi<br>and um it was not that easy to get there<br>and interview him but I interviewed him<br>five years earlier and it was it was<br>very interesting and I was feel lucky<br>that I was able to interview him again<br>on this trip<br>um uh and Dr sambay was alive on my<br>first two visits to India and but by now<br>he has passed away<br>Kama<br>uh<br>um well he had a political background I<br>don't if we know to need to go into this<br>he um he had uh left the monkhood in<br>1967 1970 he ident there was a coup in<br>Cambodia c c fell uh but K identified<br>with with COK and his organization based<br>in China<br>um uh and for a while received a salary<br>from uh the movement and support of of<br>Ceno based in China um samb was one of<br>the group of Cambodia Monks at pun<br>University at the time that Cambodia<br>felt the kou in 1975<br>um uh all these monks who were studying<br>in Pune left the monkhood in order to go<br>to the us as refugees but<br>samb perhaps because of his own<br>political philosophies which were<br>somewhat consistent with those of Kama<br>decided to stay in India uh and part so<br>he could finish his doctrate and part<br>because his sympathies were more uh with<br>the opposition to the United States um K<br>and Sam they had United Nations Refugee<br>status both had periods of residency at<br>this<br>commission and both work for periods of<br>time in the American library in New<br>Delhi uh um K Pama would eventually<br>become the mahab manager of the temple<br>trasti and S and now he's he manages<br>that Temple<br>after after maha's death and samb would<br>be the manager of the New Deli Temple um<br>he also LED tour groups of buddhis sites<br>since the 1980s um<br>a fourth figure MOA Paul was a similar<br>Lial figure in the years after<br>1975<br>um<br>um I he left the monk Hood at the end of<br>his life he became monk again um I think<br>I'll skip over this<br>um<br>um<br>but the current wave of Cambodia monks<br>going to India begin began in 1988 when<br>a Cambodian monk based in France vable<br>Tuit brought two monks to India in the<br>name of revive<br>patut that is to say dharm Mission<br>Association venerable Q Ang became an<br>effect an assistant to venerable P at<br>the New Delhi<br>Temple um perhaps already anticipating<br>his death four years later venerable s<br>pit had also been designated for the New<br>Delhi Temple but he was advised that he<br>could better pursued his<br>education at the Nanda P Institute that<br>is say Nava Nanda mahavihara which we<br>talked about<br>um an older Cambodian mon V Pon Howard<br>become a disciple of the meditation<br>Master guenka while living as a refugee<br>in the United States he made Regular<br>trips to Western India since the mid<br>1980s two younger monks from Cambodia<br>accompanied him in 1980 learned while in<br>India the possibility of studying at<br>naand mahavihara<br>um and ended up staying one was<br>Venable um who we see in the picture on<br>the right here uh on the left there's Dr<br>and uh he and venerable s pit who<br>eventually completed a doctor at San<br>Sans University in varasi currently<br>represent the two most active focal<br>points of Cambodia temple building in<br>India each in its own way is a complex<br>gatekeeper bridging Cambodia India and<br>the Cambodian<br>diaspora communities<br>um the number of Cambodian monks in<br>India continue to grow um uh<br>and this is is complex because things<br>have changed since I originally wrote<br>this at the time I wrote this there were<br>again this pattern of cambodians going<br>monks going on their own that is to say<br>with sponsorship from uh individuals in<br>Cambodia or the diaspora Community or<br>support from their home temples or um<br>sometimes support from through these<br>figures p and Dr s p um uh and<br>uh um this seems have changed and the<br>momentum of cambodians getting monks<br>getting sponsorship from Cambodia or<br>diaspora Community seems to have<br>decreased although the number of<br>scholarships from the Indian government<br>has increased and so uh there's been a<br>shift<br>in there but there are still there large<br>numbers of Cambodian monks and also<br>Cambodian lay person studying at<br>different levels of bachelor's degree<br>master's degree or doctor's degree<br>in in India<br>um<br>uh<br>um at the time of my first visit to<br>India the greatest concentrations of<br>Cambodia monks were at Banaras Hindu<br>University and at mad University near<br>Baya um<br>uh in at Banaras Hindu University in<br>2014 there were some 20 student monks<br>enough that the university gave them a<br>separate building for residents near the<br>International hostel<br>um however this hasn't decreased and now<br>they're only two Cambodian monks<br>studying at banares hinder University<br>both with with Indian government<br>scholarships um uh so I don't pretend to<br>have a clear map except to say there<br>were different patterns of funding and<br>now it seems like most many of the monks<br>who are going to India at the present<br>time are going with government of India<br>scholarships and the Indian government<br>is encouraging Buddhist studies in India<br>and and the government of India more<br>than other countries someone said<br>that as a mon<br>he would have liked to gone to China<br>perhaps but C but China does not accept<br>monks for study scholarships to study in<br>China whereas the Indian government is<br>open to that<br>possibility so there's a complex<br>relationship<br>of<br>of of what is possible and how it's<br>changed over time<br>um<br>and<br>here we'll talk about the Cambodian<br>temples um if we count the temple at<br>shasi there are 12 Cambodian temples in<br>India and Nepal in various stages of<br>completion this at the time of my I was<br>doing my research I haven't counted<br>recently and there it's complicated<br>because some Temple projects are exist<br>as projects but do not really have much<br>in the way of activities and and there<br>are some new temples um<br>but but this has also been Complicated<br>by the the pandemic and and some of the<br>internal politics of these organizations<br>um the FL Ence of Cambodian temples<br>relates the increasing numbers of<br>cambodians in pilgrimage tourism group<br>visiting sacred sites that also reflects<br>the fact that Buddhist temples from many<br>other countries exist already at these<br>sites<br>um David giri writes efforts were made<br>under the P first prime minister of<br>India javahar ALU and the president<br>rajendra prasa to reconcile religious<br>differences and promote India as quote<br>the homeland of Eastern religion and<br>stimulate pilgrimage from neighboring<br>Buddhist countries a pivotal event in<br>this mid-century nationalist context<br>with the celebration of the 2500 Buddha<br>Janti held in 1956 to commemorate the<br>birth Enlightenment and parin Nana of<br>the Great Indian tagata this is<br>something we've looked at previously<br>with large numbers of international<br>dignitaries and attend Naro invited the<br>neighboring Buddhist governments to<br>establish their own respective religious<br>so building on this historical<br>Foundation there's now a particularly<br>intensive concentration of foreign<br>Buddhist temples at bodgaya and active<br>promotion of Buddhist tourism by the<br>Indian government International Buddhist<br>presence now extends to other sacred<br>sites while one factor in the building<br>of Cambodian temples in India may be to<br>provide temples for Cambodian monks<br>studying there and occasionally to serve<br>the Cambodian diplomatic Community the<br>more important motivation for building<br>them is to meet the needs for<br>accommodation for pilgrimage groups from<br>a Cambodia and other Buddhist countries<br>more<br>subjectively given the large numbers of<br>Buddhist countries and philosophies<br>represented at sacred sites temples are<br>built as a way of affirming cambodia's<br>Place among the Buddhist nations of the<br>world purely in terms of their<br>institutional underpinnings the<br>Cambodian temples divide into two groups<br>and this is is<br>controversial um uh one includes those<br>Incorporated under the name of the Indo<br>terada Buddhist Society an organization<br>led by venerable Pur y Dr samb and Mr<br>vot tiari including temples of Deli<br>Sarat and rajar and uh um<br>and um kosami and sasti<br>um uh<br>the other group consists of those<br>Incorporated by the Cambodian M<br>Monastery trust headed by MOA Paul with<br>vable POA as the executive director<br>including temples at bod shal Kush Kushi<br>nagara l a second temple at Roger gear<br>and one at un the fact that samb and MOA<br>Paul had Indian citizenship was<br>important when these societies were<br>originally<br>created um the<br>two temple building associ do not<br>represent different schools of Cambodian<br>Buddhism or any particular difference<br>philosophically but they do represent<br>different styles and networks of loyalty<br>which may at times surface<br>tensions Dr s b joking in English played<br>on the fact that Venable P's name meta<br>refers to a Buddhist concept often<br>translated as loving kindness and he<br>equipped that well there's meta group<br>and the non meta<br>group uh the Endo terada Buddha Society<br>Temple seem to be more Loosely Allied<br>they<br>include uh and this has changed somewhat<br>uh the one Temple and and kambe is now<br>uh directly under the administration of<br>SED uh um although senit may be a force<br>behind the other temples in this group<br>different temples seem to raise funds on<br>their own and taken their own separate<br>direction from different abots<br>um the temples in this group are smaller<br>but more likely to have the central PR<br>building and are more likely to give the<br>impression of being close to<br>completion<br>um uh although receiving pilm is in<br>central activity these temples do not<br>seem to be directly involved in<br>organizing P groups coming to India in<br>contrast the P temples are all part of a<br>single project they're bigger and more<br>ambitious in the sense that they relate<br>to a grand scheme of bringing pilgrimage<br>groups regularly to India the P temples<br>are all similar in architectural style<br>either a long thin building or an<br>L-shaped building with either two or<br>three stories and multiple rooms looking<br>out toward the plaza with ch decorations<br>but looking as one Western observe said<br>much like a hotel they're also in my<br>observation and this was 10 years ago um<br>much less they to be done I think this<br>is still the case some of these temples<br>are<br>still still have not been completed Al<br>some of them have been completed that<br>were not were still being worked on when<br>I was first went to India<br>um um feral peras<br>organization this was before the<br>pandemic brought groups of Pilgrim<br>tourists twice a year and the temples<br>are all Al used for pilgrimage groups<br>from other countries<br>um anyway this gets<br>uh um here here's an example<br>of of the meta temples on the left as<br>opposed to the non meta temples on the<br>right and again this is Chang that um<br>there are new meta temples since I<br>originally wrote this paper and think<br>things have been remodeled things have<br>been changed in what I'm calling the<br>non-meta temples as well um V POA has<br>had complex problems uh<br>with<br>uh with the Indian government he was<br>because of disputes uh with local<br>authorities I understand he was not<br>allowed to go to India for a while now<br>he seemed to be going back to India uh<br>he also had disputes with Cambodian<br>authorities uh<br>I'm not going to go into the details of<br>this because it gets too complicated and<br>I could easily make a mistake um p is<br>the more<br>controversial<br>character and frankly I was assuming I<br>was asking I said what is happening to<br>his temples because for while he could<br>not even go to India and uh but when I<br>was in India this year what I learned<br>was that somehow despite everything his<br>temples seem to be have have continued<br>to to be built have continue to survive<br>through the pandemic into the present<br>day and perhaps in their own way are<br>flourishing um but this gets into things<br>that it's hard for me as an outsider to<br>valuate and<br>um uh these temples have their own<br>Dynamics they fac the crisis of the<br>pandemic in which for a period of time<br>obviously uh there were no pilgrimage<br>groups going to to India and yet<br>now the pilgrimage groups are beginning<br>to go again uh I think both groups of<br>temples they rely they do rely on<br>Cambodian pilgrimage groups but um in<br>order to survive they have pilgrimage<br>groups from other countries particularly<br>Thailand Thailand has a lot of buddist<br>pilgrimage groups going to uh uh<br>and S Pen for example speaks Thai<br>because he lived in in a Thai Monastery<br>for a while he speaks they they have<br>they speak multiple languages which is<br>they're they're really quite both S and<br>P are in many ways very remarkable<br>figures who have managed to have a<br>complex Multicultural identity um which<br>which which in itself is quite<br>interesting<br>um<br>um<br>um well let's go on quickly and I uh to<br>the pilgrimage group and<br>Sri Lanka is also significant<br>um well maybe I'll just use the notes on<br>the on the PowerPoint uh prior to the<br>pandemic PAB brought at least two groups<br>a year one at Ken time with 300 people<br>and one at men February with 250 people<br>reports are that pilgrimage groups are<br>going to India once again although it's<br>not clear whether they're sponsored by P<br>metas<br>organization as I said pilgrimage this<br>gets complicated because pilgrims are<br>often donors or become donors and so uh<br>the fact of these pilgrimage groups they<br>uh and they also relate to the students<br>because the<br>students uh the monks if you're monk<br>studying in Sri Lanka or India then when<br>these pil groups goes they often<br>especially if it's during a vacation<br>period Then the monks will accompany the<br>groups and also receive donations from<br>the pilgrimage groups and<br>so<br>they're they receive financial support<br>and there's the possibility that these<br>monks will<br>develop a personal relationship with me<br>MERS of the pilgrimage groups who who<br>will then go on to continue to sponsor<br>them in some ways um and uh they also<br>the pilgrimage groups develop a<br>relationship to the temples and they may<br>continue to contribute to the temples<br>after they've returned from the<br>pilgrimage groups<br>um<br>and the pilgrims support Cambodian<br>temples because it will make pilgrimage<br>more easy in the future but also because<br>they want to see cambod clearly present<br>as one of the Buddhist Nations<br>represented at sacred sites there's a<br>there's a nationalist aspect to this<br>there's a feeling<br>that by contributing these temples they<br>see if you go to bodgaya there is there<br>are temples from Tibet um China<br>Japan Thailand Burma um<br>and cambodians who go as pilgrims want<br>to see a Cambodian Temple because they<br>want to say our our our type of Buddhism<br>deserves has a place among the Buddhism<br>of the world and so this becomes part of<br>the dynamic of this whole process<br>um<br>um so anyway of course there<br>are the most famous pilgrimage<br>sitesa<br>Saga and then but but there's a whole<br>series of other other pilgrimage Heights<br>at barasi at kosambi at trasti where<br>each one has a history of<br>supporting temples in various Buddhist<br>Traditions<br>um<br>um<br>um there is also a Cambodian temple in<br>Sri Lanka and so let's talk about that<br>quickly um<br>and<br>um well Sri Lanka is also significant<br>destination or Cambodian Buddhist<br>pilgrims group it is less common and<br>took longer to develop it was also<br>longer before there were attempts to<br>build a cimar<br>temple as in the case of India the<br>Cambodian Le dharm teacher buong and his<br>disciples have influence the direction<br>of<br>development if only because bong's three<br>trips to Sri Lanka together with<br>pilgrimage groups set the stage for<br>other kinds of group tours and<br>funding five monks from wat gold to Tong<br>one of the temples closely identified<br>with bong would go to study in Sri Lanka<br>while this number is relatively small<br>some of these monks have been<br>influential including one who was the<br>president of the association of<br>Cambodian monks in Sri Lanka and two who<br>have played a major role in the temple<br>building<br>project as we have seen the recent<br>history of Cambodia monst Sri Lanka has<br>been characterized by their difficulty<br>in finding appropriate housing and<br>ambivalence about accommodating the<br>powerful Sri Lankan monks it was<br>Cambodian pilgrims who had been to India<br>who encouraged the Sri Lankan monks to<br>build a temple some initial attempts<br>were made to locate a site at<br>anuradapura but that came to nothing<br>anatur is a major uh temple side uh the<br>initial Explorations about temple<br>building took place in the framework of<br>the Cambodian student monks Association<br>in Sri Lanka but when that did not seem<br>to be leading anywh a group of monks who<br>were not officers in the association<br>push forward to act independently this<br>would result in tensions perhaps the<br>marginalization of the former leadership<br>of the association the fact that two of<br>the monks involved in the new project<br>were previously connected with bong may<br>have given them use ful fundraising<br>connections another key monk was one of<br>the first child monks come to Sri Lanka<br>who successfully acquired sen Hal's<br>language and was very much in the Ambit<br>of his original sponsor venerable Ali<br>Soo his preceptor for biku<br>oration the connection to soita with his<br>strong political links to the Sri Lanka<br>government proved to be invaluable the<br>monks emphasized that a balance of<br>skills among the three of them made the<br>project possible the monks made use of<br>land donated trust to venerable omal Soo<br>as an elderly by an elderly woman a<br>retired school teacher who remained a<br>significant Presence at the temple until<br>her death in<br>2016 an agreement was signed on October<br>2010 some monks moved into the house<br>that was on the property and work began<br>on a anakot an a residence for mons this<br>occurred in India Cambodian artisans<br>were brought to do the work in ch style<br>although the site is remote from<br>universities where the monks study and<br>has been successful as a focal point for<br>the Cambodian monks and it works well as<br>a residence for monks studying at the<br>postgraduate level who do not have to<br>attend classes daily the temple has<br>enough rooms to provide accommodation<br>for Cambodian pilgrims visiting Sri<br>Lanka but this has so far been secondary<br>the function of providing residents for<br>monks<br>um<br>um and I believe that there's the<br>Cambodian temple in Sri Lanka is is<br>largely completed now it was still very<br>much in a building stage when I the two<br>times I<br>visited<br>um I think I'm going to end at that<br>here's another video and just to end<br>with a this is a shorter video and then<br>we'll we'll end with that uh and we can<br>I hope we can have some discussion about<br>this<br>um let's see if this<br>works<br>um<br>affiliated uh uh<br>or that<br>made this<br>was the P groups had very high quality<br>video productions um uh and they they<br>printed<br>booket sort<br>the L leader his<br>name trying to remember his<br>name<br>speech for speech<br>forign speech foreign speech fore speech<br>speech foreign speech speech spech for<br>speech okay I think that's it and oh I<br>have here again is a picture of the<br>Cambodian temple in Sri Lanka<br>um here is was the plans for it and you<br>can see I think these might have been<br>pictures I took myself when I was there<br>when the building was still very much<br>ongoing uh it's now from pictures I've<br>seen on Facebook it's it's they may<br>still plan more building but<br>it's it it looks very much like a temple<br>at the present time<br>uh<br>um um and the opening ceremony was uh<br>the international Buddhist center took<br>place on November 2013 and the president<br>of Sri Lanka was present um<br>this had a big sign welcome yes and of<br>course uh now he's no longer in power<br>and I I don't claim to understand uh the<br>political situation there um I've heard<br>that<br>uh uh that the monk who had this time<br>was closely identified with him I ended<br>up opposing him as well um again I don't<br>dare uh have any opinion about shanan<br>politics which which are quite<br>complicated uh um some important figures<br>came from Cambodia including a very<br>prominent<br>lay uh woman figure uh there were<br>message of greetings from religious and<br>political figures from Sri Lanka and<br>Cambodia<br>including<br>um some of the highest ranking Cambodia<br>among that hang buub display lead who's<br>been very in cult<br>Cambodia<br>umal and his speech talks about his<br>distress over the state of<br>Buddhism um and there was also a SEMA<br>ceremony for the Cambodian Temple uh of<br>fil in on February 28<br>2014 24 title monks were present and<br>altogether 75 monks<br>again uh<br>sang uh U quite an<br>important uh Cambodian ranking monk who<br>perhaps may eventually become the Mahan<br>patriarch um he took the central role of<br>cutting the twine for the central sea<br>Stone uh uh uh groups came from B K in<br>Cambodia and again the<br>figure<br>um uh a lay female Buddhist leader um<br>attended uh she's been at one point she<br>played a very prominent role in the<br>support of these foreign temples<br>um um there was mention of unresolved<br>zoning problems and um<br>and well these are sort of other<br>but I I my my PowerPoint which I<br>prepared some time ago I included a<br>picture of a a prominent senior monk<br>who's based in Canada receiving a<br>doctorate at Delhi University in 2004<br>there have been s since been other monks<br>and ex monks who received their<br>doctorate in India and um below there's<br>a Cambodian monk receiving a master's<br>degree in Sri Lanka in 2015 well there<br>have also been Cambodian monks have re<br>re doctorates in in Sri Lanka since then<br>and uh to close well to relate this to<br>my previous talks um a actually my<br>original plan when I went to India was<br>that there was going to be a ceremony<br>honoring dharmar mahat the the monk I I<br>talked about in my first lecture and he<br>had uh died 25 years ago and there have<br>been sometimes ceremonies honoring him<br>on his birthday which is February 12th<br>and um I made my plans to go to India<br>with the idea that I'd attend that and<br>then for various reasons they changed<br>the date of the ceremony and I left<br>before the ceremony uh which is fine I<br>was able to visit the temple eye I but<br>um so well one person sent me some<br>photos other one of these pictures the<br>one on the right or something someone<br>sent me the others are are pictur<br>pictures that were posted on Facebook um<br>I think among the group of monks<br>attending I believe is mom saon who's<br>one of our video participants and um but<br>anyway this just to show and and here<br>present<br>are are probably all the Cambodian monks<br>who are currently in the New Delhi area<br>and and many of the Cambodian L students<br>who are studying in in New Delhi at the<br>present time as well as representatives<br>of the Cambodian Embassy and um and<br>other people who had historically had a<br>connection with dharmara mahat in the<br>past<br>so again this relates to some extent<br>to my talk today but it also connects us<br>to uh the story the history of Dharma<br>bar mahat Tera which we started out with<br>on our first<br>so okay so I'll conclude with that and<br>open it up<br>to<br>to comments and questions and I<br>um and of course as always I'm very<br>interested in the comments of the<br>cambodians who are here by video but<br>also Anushka who knows about Shan<br>Buddhism and uh but any one I'm and as<br>always I'm a non- Cambodian uh not<br>Indian or Sri Lankan either and so I'm<br>very much open to the comments of people<br>who know about these things more from<br>do I get I guess one thing that<br>interests me like people have been<br>making pilgrimages to these Buddhist<br>sites for more than 2 200 years right so<br>it's probably not that different you<br>know and I just find it really poignant<br>that they want to take their own food<br>with them that they can't eat Tre L food<br>and like I was talking the bus bus with<br>the pilgrims had they brought their own<br>food with them you know well I was<br>telling Elizabeth about my experiences<br>traveling in India and at one point uh I<br>was staying at Cambodian temples uh and<br>um I I written this article which<br>published in Spanish and I've been<br>looking at this topic for several years<br>but this time<br>by by luck or by accident I was in<br>Varanasi and I wanted to go to Roger<br>gear and the Abbot of the TI and varasi<br>said there's a pilgrimage group that<br>will be going by bus from barasi to<br>bodgaya and he said that if I me to<br>bodgaya I it would be much cheaper for<br>me to go from there to R gear and so I<br>rode the bus with the pilgrimage group<br>and I end up uh they stayed in a hotel<br>in but guy I end up staying at the same<br>hotel and<br>so well some of the things I observed I<br>knew already because I studied these<br>video um these videos of the pilgrimage<br>groups but as I was telling one thing<br>that I was more aware of is that and<br>also was aware from staying at these<br>Cambodian temples and when I was staying<br>at these Cambodian temples the<br>pilgrimage groups would come stay stay<br>at the temple while they were were<br>visiting sacred sites in barasi or<br>Sarat sasti and then so I could see how<br>it worked and the way it works is that<br>these say a group from Cambodia will<br>bring uh Cooks from Cambodia and uh and<br>um and<br>so if you're with these groups you know<br>in many ways it's very hard for these<br>groups they I think when I look at that<br>video we saw today I think these people<br>they were uh they were C they were uh<br>experiencing a very intense devotional<br>experience but it's possible they were<br>also very tired from having been on this<br>pilgrims group for some time and so this<br>is not an easy trip for the participants<br>but they do have cooks and my experience<br>with the food was very very good uh and<br>so uh they're not<br>eating Indian food they're eating<br>Cambodian food food which is prepared by<br>Cooks who brought from their home<br>country and that becomes uh that's an<br>important uh cultural thing at these<br>groups uh so because Sri Lankan Pilgrim<br>groups who are going to India they're<br>doing the same thing yes they even<br>bringing this coconut coconuts like the<br>whole coconuts with them no this is true<br>I intervie some of them they want Safe<br>Water right I have no like coconuts<br>grape coconuts so they can cook because<br>they have two cooks and then they can<br>scrape coconut coconut so they're not<br>getting any Indian kind of interaction<br>or cultural experience in a way because<br>B guy also you can talk to people in<br>Singa the beggar would call you in Singa<br>like talk to you in Singa yeah so it's<br>really yeah they're not Adventure<br>tourists they're it's not it's yeah<br>they're going to Jambu basically<br>not yeah they're going to jump into the<br>vehic yeah that's right yeah that's why<br>it's an emotional experience that's why<br>it's yeah I mean these I I feel like my<br>as I said I have these two articles the<br>one is written has only been published<br>in Spanish and the other one which was<br>in your reading packet is uh is well it<br>based on my experiences in India and Sri<br>Lanka and with interviews but it<br>basically draws on what I was able to<br>learn from these videos uh and that is<br>specifically focused on the pilgrimage<br>issues but um but there's a lot to be<br>said about these things and there uh<br>actually there is<br>um uh a scholar in the United States who<br>works primarily with cambodians<br>in in Long Beach California and she<br>works her research has been mostly with<br>the diaspora Community not so much in<br>Cambodia itself and at one point she<br>announced that she was going to go on<br>one of these pilgrimage groups with<br>uh but in the end for various reasons I<br>it might have been about the time of the<br>pandemic she she did not go and so but<br>in terms of an anthropological research<br>project it would be quite interesting to<br>uh to participate in one of these these<br>pilgrimage groups so I I I I worked like<br>in some interviews for my brers India so<br>I had to like go to this one of the<br>pilgrims groups and then interview them<br>yes so I also had the chance to like eat<br>with them which is really good and then<br>and then there's like some regulations<br>in Sri Lanka so you can't operate<br>throughout the year yeah because some of<br>the months will be so cold in those<br>places Sri Lankans are not used to it<br>yes but anyways they're doing it so I<br>think some people have died in some of<br>the cold weather really are you talking<br>about in India or Sri Lanka itself Sri<br>Lankan pilgrims in India to India yeah<br>because yeah John John said he was about<br>ready to freeze no the first uh well<br>well first actually the first time we<br>went to India actually Elizabeth and I<br>went at the same time and it was very<br>hot and we were so ignorant we did not<br>realize there's some months to to not<br>travel in India but because we had a air<br>conditioned car it actually turned out<br>okay it was it turned out that year was<br>not quite as hot as sometimes it gets<br>and then the second time I went in<br>December and<br>uh<br>and and India was can be really really<br>cold it is it's really cold and they<br>don't have a heating system yeah yeah<br>just like I know he was saying I can't<br>wait till I get to New Zealand because<br>it's so cold here and I said well<br>actually I think the temperature is the<br>same actually I was checking the<br>temperature as I was traveling and on my<br>phone I had the temperature in places I<br>was in India and the temperature in den<br>and it was often about the<br>same but at least there's a<br>heater but<br>umal and uh but actually<br>um but because I was staying in<br>Cambodian temples they were<br>and the cambodians who are listening<br>video I the Cambodian temples are very<br>nice to me and I'm very<br>grateful um and<br>they you know in one place I had hot<br>water and other places they uh they<br>would even boil water so I could take a<br>hot bath and and I and that did make a<br>big difference and uh so if you are<br>someplace with where the people who who<br>were hosting you in this case I was<br>staying in Cambodia temples that they<br>know how to they know what to do and<br>they they are concerned for your welfare<br>it it it was okay it was and I it yeah<br>so this this Cambodian temple in Sri<br>Lanka like it opened uh it opened in<br>2013 right like they have opened it uh<br>what do I have here it was older it was<br>when<br>I it started earlier but they but they<br>actually they had the uh opening<br>ceremony in 2013 they I I have the dates<br>the dates are in the article and they<br>had gotten the money from uh not the the<br>land from an elderly woman who was still<br>alive the first times I visited there<br>and and she was it was her property and<br>monk and you know and ultim the the<br>territory the the land the property was<br>it was in a trust and ultimately he told<br>it the Monk and a Sri Lankan Monk and<br>you know if he chose take it away he<br>probably could have but everyone was<br>devoted to this project of building the<br>Temple uh and<br>uh the Sri Lankans did not know quite<br>how to take it uh they uh people said<br>that the neighborhood people said oh but<br>this is a Mahana Temple and uh<br>because because it was different from a<br>Sri Lankan Temple and they said well no<br>this is<br>another kind of Teri Temple and actually<br>once I was trying I was on<br>a uh tricycle I was trying to get to the<br>temple<br>and they were asking directions from we<br>were close to the temple and we asked<br>the people uh oh is the Cambodian Temple<br>near they they said Oh you mean the Thai<br>temple so even in Sri Lanka there was a<br>tendency to to identify it not and<br>Cambodian but as Tai somehow so uh and<br>this is the kind of thing that of course<br>the cambodians are not happy about at<br>all this is a Cambodian Cambodian Temple<br>but Sri Lanka was in like a very<br>different moment at that point because<br>we had like 2009 there was like war war<br>victory over and there was like this<br>huge project of singala Buddhist<br>nationalism and building nation and<br>Buddhist revivalism and then there was<br>this myar monk Asin Vu came to Sri Lanka<br>and they had like a huge 10,000 attende<br>ceremony or something and then yeah<br>because of that I think Sri Lanka also<br>wanted to be like a center of Buddhist<br>World maybe so they have for a long<br>long uh and yes that when I was<br>there uh it was after the the war with<br>the Thomas had ended and then there were<br>uh there were tensions arising uh with<br>Buddhist Muslim uh issues and we don't<br>need to go into that but uh so uh and as<br>you of course and I don't pretend to<br>understand the situation but of<br>course<br>uh the politics in relationship to<br>religion continue to be very complicated<br>in in Sri Lanka as I'm sure you could<br>tell us much better better than I can so<br>because so the was like one of the<br>strong part of that m in yes so he was<br>one of the first monks who sat on<br>Parliament right right so he like so<br>they were in Hell which is like formed<br>by like faction of Buddhist Nationalist<br>and then only monks were appointed as<br>parliamentary members<br>through this party and they they they<br>one of the things they were trying like<br>the first one of the things first things<br>they wanted to do is like stop like<br>forceful conversions which were not<br>forceful conversions it's just like<br>converting to other religions or<br>something but they were in this Raj Paka<br>so with the all of them were in like one<br>huge section so yeah and when I went to<br>Sri Lanka I wasn't looking for political<br>things at all I I just thought this is a<br>very non-controversial thing Cambodian<br>monk studied in Sri Lanka and then I<br>found out<br>that things got complicated fast and and<br>as you know that uh well my interaction<br>with venerable omala were quite positive<br>he and he I will say<br>that<br>um my my contact with him and what<br>people told me about him he has<br>definitely been had a very positive role<br>definitely has been very very supportive<br>of the<br>Cambodian of Cambodia and the cambodians<br>in and Sri Lanka at the other hand I<br>know<br>that he's a political Monk and he<br>represents a certain kind of political<br>posture and and so that the fact that<br>Cambodian most the Cambodian monks<br>um uh seem to almost all have at this<br>point or the last time I was there was<br>several years ago<br>have are in some ways under his<br>umbrella and that has implications as<br>well<br>for what does it mean for Cambodian<br>monks to be studied in Sri Lanka and<br>will it have does it have political<br>implications or when the Cambodian monks<br>return to Cambodia will they<br>be they're you know they're leaving Sri<br>Lankan politics behind it may have no<br>effect on them at all but these are<br>questions one might<br>ask like you sort of think of the the<br>Asian foundation with they're gonna<br>learn too much communism cut their<br>scholarships you know right I mean yeah<br>the the Cambodian monks in the 1950s who<br>received they were receiving these<br>scholarships<br>from uh these Cambodian associations uh<br>the uh the friends of the poly school or<br>the Cambodian World branch of world<br>Fellowship of Buddhist but they were not<br>perhaps not even aware that the money<br>came from the Asia Foundation or if they<br>were they weren't thinking of that<br>having political applications and yet<br>even something seemingly as innocuous as<br>getting a scholarship to<br>study Buddhism or or study uh it ends up<br>implications<br>um oh some oh okay I<br>was I see that pet son has his hand<br>raised um first of all I just want to<br>say thank you so much for um this course<br>I really enjoyed it and and it's so<br>exciting and uh I myself have never been<br>to uh uh Sri Lanka or India or Nepal<br>even though I've been as Buddhist man<br>for almost 20 years but but uh uh for<br>some reason I I never got a chance to go<br>to to that place and um but uh I I have<br>a lot of friends not a lot but many of<br>my friends who who been to uh India for<br>uh uh Pilgrim M reason or for Education<br>reason but uh regarding uh the uh<br>political implication for I mean after<br>the Kam R especially concerning with the<br>concerning the uh Buddhist Cambodian<br>Buddhist studing industry I I from my<br>own perspective of my own views I might<br>be wrong but uh there seem no political<br>implication impact on on buddhis man<br>studying in Sri Lanka because the the<br>relationship between the Cambodia and<br>and as Sri Lanka<br>is like mostly based on uh religion or<br>or Buddhism not not not concerning the<br>politics at all this is from what I can<br>understand but uh uh in the case of<br>Indian from the past I think you might<br>be right in terms of political<br>implication but uh in the recent time I<br>I as I said I might be wrong but I I I<br>hardly see anyone who has a political<br>actually I I agree with you in that that<br>I<br>I the monks or former monks who I've had<br>contact with who studied in Sri Lanka<br>and then returned to<br>Cambodia I don't see any evidence that<br>it's affected their them politically so<br>uh that that is what I'm trying to say<br>question is whether whether because of<br>and I apologize if if not everyone<br>agrees with this term I would say<br>there's a lot of Buddhist nationalism in<br>in Sri Lanka and<br>uh the question is whether any of the<br>monks who've studied in Sri Lanka would<br>have a similar Buddhist nationalism once<br>they returned to Cambodia I don't see<br>that but that's the<br>question I think most most of U kin<br>Buddhist man who went to study
