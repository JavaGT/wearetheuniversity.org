were then they would put it on a<br>flash drive and come back the next day<br>uh because I don't know how to get it<br>off of telegram and onto my computer<br>because it's a big it's a big file and<br>uh<br>and so I'm still<br>um if there was anyone who got used tell<br>you don't use the app telegram do you no<br>no<br>no well no I mean eventually old<br>people because I have someone sent me in<br>India someone sent me a PDF of a book<br>but they sent it using Telegraph now I<br>don't know well uh it's tragic well no I<br>I mean it might be I could just download<br>it onto my phone I just I don't remember<br>how big the file is but it's a big<br>thought and can you do it in the<br>computer can you do it well the thing is<br>I don't know how to get it from hram to<br>my computer sometimes these apps work on<br>your computer<br>also sometimes yeah but I and like in in<br>my case with case of WhatsApp and and<br>Telegram I I can only see be use them on<br>my phone and not on my computer maybe<br>yeah it's not easy getting a legal<br>PDFs Li they make it harder and harder<br>yes and that's why I'm I'm not keeping<br>the five precepts because I I'm I'm<br>intellectual property and now this been<br>broadcast it's<br>probably that's like Angela is making<br>note of this and she's going to really<br>it argument about that so you're<br>actually not<br>stealing<br>what actual sharing PDF is Ste I don't<br>know like I don't know why I can't<br>download the PDF file of the book on<br>here really so<br>hard I do it all the time maybe I can do<br>it in my home but I can't do it in like<br>just they've just changed it so it's<br>harder to<br>do are you doing it as logged in as a<br>student so you might have to so that's<br>that's yeah okay okay I think yeah<br>that's a a young a young<br>pict 10 years ago yeah Don't Be Cruel<br>they don't change<br>first<br>well is it time it's after two it's a<br>little bit after two so we oh good P<br>here too okay<br>so shall I let I'll let you go well last<br>time I just introduced myself and I<br>think I think everyone who's<br>participating uh has participated<br>previously and so um so you all know me<br>that I'm John marsten I'm visiting<br>beneden from uh El Mexico in Mexico City<br>U and I've been giving talks based on my<br>research uh which my research is focused<br>heavily on Buddhism in Cambodia um but<br>but some of these topics also relate to<br>the ways that Cambodia<br>connects to other Buddhist countries and<br>Buddhist Traditions so um my talk<br>today is a little bit different in that<br>it's an older research that I did and I<br>see now that saana L is joining us which<br>is also also very nice and um so this is<br>older research and actually when I was<br>invited to to give this series of talks<br>I was told it should be Recent research<br>but<br>this this publication which is my talk<br>is based on is an older<br>publication um and um I often say it's<br>of the things I've written about<br>Buddhism in Cambodia it's it it perhaps<br>is the one that seems all significant to<br>me and it seems significant in that um<br>not just for Cambodia although it's very<br>focused on the details of Cambodian<br>Buddhism but in the history of Buddhism<br>there are not that many times when uh<br>when a Buddhist lineage a monastic<br>lineage has been interrupted and started<br>again and so I felt this is a<br>significant moment the fact that during<br>the ppot period Then Cambodian Buddhism<br>was was ended a very few exceptions and<br>and then at a certain moment following<br>the popot period there was this moment<br>in<br>which um Buddhism was was reestablished<br>and so what was the process of that and<br>so there are standard versions of what<br>happened and but my research was looking<br>on the ground and trying to get a more<br>complex and a more nuanced version of of<br>what actually<br>happened<br>um<br>um so in the past I've been talking<br>about my research as a whole and the<br>first day I talked about my interest<br>in uh peripheral Buddhism that is to say<br>I talked about<br>how uh the standard way of looking at<br>history of Buddhism would be to look at<br>the Buddhism of the capital the Buddhism<br>of the dominant<br>population but I at one point began<br>looking at uh people who were Crossing<br>Borders monks who were crossing border<br>and the way that Buddhism can exist not<br>just at the center but at the<br>peripheries<br>and uh this earlier research is not<br>about people at the peripheries but it<br>takes a topic which has primarily been<br>written about from the point of view of<br>of the center of plumen of the most<br>powerful monks supported by the<br>government and tries to look at<br>it um at what was happening at the<br>Grassroots among uh that that makes our<br>vision of what happened more complicated<br>um in in when I was a doctoral student I<br>was interested in the work of Pierre<br>bordo and uh Pierre<br>BAU was gave a lot of emphasis how<br>conceptual categories were negotiated<br>and and the word negotiated has um has<br>been significant for me in my own<br>research and so what I the vision I have<br>here is not that something was right or<br>that was wrong but that different people<br>at a moment of change were negotiating<br>their situation negotiate the word<br>negotiate can<br>mean uh to people discussing trying to<br>come to an agreement or but we also use<br>the word negotiating like if we were if<br>we were traveling by by boat on a very<br>rough River we might say we negotiated<br>the river uh<br>and so what I wanted to convey here is<br>this idea of uh Cambodian Buddhism or<br>Cambodian Buddhist negotiating their<br>path at at a time of of change<br>um<br>uh so This research is based heavily on<br>interviews um as you'll see there is<br>at least one key text which<br>is uh again I'm talking about what<br>happened in 1979 after the overthrow of<br>poot when Buddhism was established and<br>um there may be other texts which I have<br>not had access to Cambodian texts<br>but um when I began looking at this<br>topic I I<br>a friend of mine who's a scholar Vietnam<br>uh put an announcement on the Vietnamese<br>studies group whether there were any<br>Vietnamese text on this topic and I<br>found a Vietnamese text which described<br>the N September 1979 ordination and I've<br>relied heavily on this<br>um at the same time I was interviewing<br>people on the ground uh wherever I could<br>to find out their version of what was<br>happening in the months leading up to<br>the September<br>um so my talk today I'm I'm a little bit<br>worried about because I have fewer<br>slides um and as I have been in the past<br>lectures I've been relying heavily on on<br>my published works or written versions<br>of the things and um I was wondering how<br>to make this more interesting and I do<br>think as I said that this is a from the<br>perspective of Cambodia or perspective<br>of Buddhist history more generally I do<br>think this is a a significant topic<br>although um it also relies heavily on<br>attention to small details about what<br>was happening in Cambodia which may may<br>be hard to follow um Elizabeth<br>said<br>um maybe a good way to talk about this<br>would be to talk about my fieldwork<br>experience uh in this and so before I<br>start with a paper proper let's talk<br>about how I did the research for this<br>which might be relevant to your own<br>experience of doing research um so here<br>is a slide of me<br>and um and some of you who know me will<br>notice that I'm quite a bit younger and<br>this this um perhaps was in<br>1998 uh and um here I am I'm I was uh<br>just starting a doctoral program at<br>University of Washington and the man on<br>my right is Dr Charles kais who is my<br>doctoral supervisor and uh on the left<br>are two of the most most important<br>Cambodian Monks at that time uh who at<br>that time they did not have the idols<br>samd uh in Cambodia uh but the the two<br>monks<br>are what is now some that tapung who's<br>the at the present time the highest<br>ranking monk in Cambodia he was at that<br>time too and uh he's and farthest to the<br>left is is<br>the monk umsum who also later had the<br>title Sam and they were very perhaps the<br>number one and number two monks in<br>Cambodia at that time and<br>I um and so I felt very and and this was<br>at a time when there was no diplomatic<br>relations between Cambodia and the<br>United States and there was a group<br>called us and the China reconciliation<br>project which I had which I had some<br>connection to because uh they this<br>organization was trying to encourage<br>Scholars from the United States to go to<br>the countries of Vietnam LA and Cambodia<br>in order that there could be a process<br>of reconciliation that there could be um<br>uh um and this would not have been 1998<br>it would have been 19<br>8s 88 uh uh and it was before the Paris<br>agreements uh and uh um uh so this was<br>in the late 1980s so uh um when I had<br>just started grad school and<br>um um so this<br>organization<br>uh began by bringing what they thought<br>were non-controversial<br>uh Cambodian figures to the United<br>States as a way that dialogue could be<br>opened up they the first person they<br>brought was the head of the Cambodian<br>Red Cross and then they brought this<br>these two high ranking<br>monks uh to the United States and they<br>went to various cities in the United<br>States and they met<br>cambodians uh they went to the Cambodian<br>monks the cambodi tipples in the United<br>States and my<br>professor asked about something that at<br>that point I never would have thought to<br>ask about and he asked about this<br>process of reestablishing the Cambodian<br>mood and uh and how exactly it had taken<br>place what was the ritual what was the<br>uh what what was the process involved<br>and uh he had<br>had I can't remember the details he had<br>been in<br>Cambodia at around the time this was<br>taking place and so this was not a topic<br>that I was pursuing at all in my<br>research at that time uh the next step<br>in my research on this topic was when um<br>I had a research assistant whose name is<br>pro son at that time he was a do that<br>time he was a student at the uh School<br>of Archaeology<br>and um through him I got to know his<br>father who was<br>and uh uh the in Cambodia we call them<br>AA which is related to the word aan in<br>Thai and uh it's in as it's used in<br>Cambodian Buddhism it's a it's a a l<br>specialist who works with the monks and<br>helps perform rituals in the in the<br>temple and he was an AA at w unalam<br>which as we saw last time is the one of<br>the most with is one of the most<br>important temples in in Cambodia and he<br>also had a book store uh he's no longer<br>living and then uh for some reason he<br>began talking to me about this uh<br>ceremony in September<br>1979 and I took elaborate notes and um<br>it didn't seem related to my research at<br>that time uh but I had these notes and<br>he had been at the very beginning of<br>the of the post Popa period he he had<br>already been had this role as a cha in<br>the temple there and so I had these sets<br>of notes about and I I never used it for<br>my research and<br>then then my own research over the years<br>was<br>with in St bati in in kapun Cham<br>Province uh and there I had my own<br>reasons for going to this area I was<br>interested in as we said last time there<br>are ban Traditions uh and and there's<br>the reformed and non-reformed traditions<br>I went there looking for to learn more<br>about the non-reformed traditions and<br>there was uh a temple there called what<br>it has another name as well and for some<br>reason the people in that area said when<br>you were in this area you have to go and<br>pay respect to this this monk the Abbott<br>of this Temple and so I the truth is I<br>was never completely comfortable with<br>this monk but<br>um but he was obviously revered by the<br>villagers and he would tell me things<br>which<br>were a bit unusual and on two occasions<br>he things he talked about then became my<br>research topics and one of them was<br>he talked about the early days and how<br>he had he had originally ordained and<br>the whole complex process whereby<br>ordination began to take place in<br>Cambodia um following the fall of the<br>poot period and the picture that began<br>to merge was something more complicated<br>than I'd originally thought and and<br>that's what I began to try to document<br>in this research um<br>So eventually as I said I'm I'm<br>interested in this<br>September<br>ordination but I became interested in<br>what took place before the September<br>ordination and<br>um and I began to learn about well some<br>pre uh and the most famous one was<br>someone named n Mani who when I began my<br>research was still alive and so I was<br>able to interview him in pren and we'll<br>talk about him uh and I learned about<br>another person who at that time was in<br>Te Province who uh this is an odd story<br>because I met a monk who told me I could<br>never use his name and I'll try to<br>describe him in such a way that you<br>don't know who he is but he said that<br>um he had ordained early in the pop<br>early following the popot period and<br>but uh the authorities had wanted him to<br>this was before the September 1979<br>ordination the authories wanted him to<br>defro and<br>reordain in the new lineage that was set<br>up in September 1979 and he refused to<br>do that and this is why he didn't want<br>anyone to know that he had refused to do<br>that but he had he<br>had believed that his first ordination<br>was valid and he was unwilling<br>to abandon that and reordain in the<br>state state the official state monastic<br>lineage this was a fairly prominent monk<br>who as I said told me never never to say<br>publicly uh that he had done this is and<br>um but through him I learned about this<br>person who is performing ordinations in<br>Teo Province and uh I went to Teo<br>Province I met people who had known him<br>and eventually I was able to meet him in<br>in uh cville another city in Cambodia um<br>and as I'll say here I met a couple<br>other people and the two things I've<br>just mentioned were<br>clearly confirmed by many people uh uh<br>but the thing about oral research is<br>that interviews<br>are you can never know whether you can<br>trust people's memories or not uh so I<br>met actually I met another Monk in in<br>the United States in Rochester Minnesota<br>it was name is venerable chanun and he<br>claimed to have ordained early in 1979<br>where where monks cross the border from<br>Vietnam Campa monks CA means the ethnic<br>May in<br>Vietnam and he had performed this been<br>ordained in a ceremony in mayot which is<br>on the border with Vietnam and I did<br>travel to Maymont I tried to find out<br>and I found no confirmation of this<br>ordination ceremony but I but at least I<br>had this story uh then in the area<br>around PR<br>what PR I found other stories of of<br>people who had ordained uh uh one story<br>was an old man who was still living<br>there living then I assume by now he has<br>died quite an old man who who claim to<br>have been a toot monk as you know there<br>are the two or as in Thailand and La<br>there are the two orders the Mahan and<br>the tayun and uh he CLA clim to have<br>gone with a uh he claimed to have there<br>that there was a monk there in in kapun<br>Cham Province who had never left the<br>monkhood this was this was one of the<br>odd things about the situation in<br>Cambodia because the general con story<br>about the popot in Cambodia is that all<br>monks were forced to leave the monkhood<br>and in general this is true but in odd<br>Corners that were usually older men and<br>the the Camus just<br>decided you know let them keep on their<br>robes there there were just a handful of<br>of older monks who for some reason the<br>Karu is allowed to never leave the<br>monkhood and then there as we'll see<br>there were other monks who were asked to<br>leave the monkhood but but claimed to<br>have like nil<br>Mani uh who claim to<br>have uh maintain Buddhist discipline<br>even though they were no longer wearing<br>their ropes and so we have a rather more<br>complicated situation than we might find<br>um I have this most of my PowerPoints<br>which I giving you are are older<br>PowerPoints that I've used earlier and<br>and I F actually I didn't find much in<br>the way of PowerPoints on this topic I<br>found this one which seems to be be<br>quite old and it perhaps doesn't<br>correspond exactly to what um to my<br>article which I had you read and uh one<br>thing that I found in this PowerPoint<br>which unfortunately I I don't have in my<br>article and I can't totally confirm the<br>details is that one thing I did research<br>on<br>was ordinations that took place in the<br>border camps and I uh<br>well I I think I have pictures here um<br>and so we're getting into this is not<br>1979 we're getting into the mid 80s when<br>uh there were populations of refugees on<br>the border and uh there were cam refugee<br>camps for cambodians who were claiming<br>that they had they were claiming that<br>Buddhism in Cambodia in pen under the<br>pumin government was was not legitimate<br>at that time there were severe<br>restrictions on Cambodian Buddhism and<br>they claimed to be a more legitimate<br>type of Buddhism there in the refugee<br>camps and they also this was much later<br>in the mid 80s then they would perform<br>their own ordination using Tha monks or<br>using Cambodian monks who had fled to<br>Thailand before who had been in Thailand<br>before the popot period or fled as<br>refugees and and we're still living in<br>Thailand and could perform these these<br>these ordinations so um this is a more<br>minor actually the reason this is not in<br>my the art the publish article uh in<br>English that you have is<br>because when I wanted to publish the<br>article they had a very strict word<br>length and um I had to cut something and<br>I cut this section and actually I have a<br>a version of this paper that was<br>published in Spanish and that has the<br>the part about uh the Border issues but<br>unfortunately I<br>don't I don't have the information of<br>this but just to say this is part of the<br>whole complexity of the situation<br>um<br>um<br>and and just to before I start my paper<br>proper I'll try to relate this a bit to<br>to the papers we been giving well one of<br>them is that ordination of course<br>relates to semas and that so that<br>because semas take place uh that<br>ordinations should take place within a<br>SEMA and so so as Elizabeth was<br>saying uh and and by the way I'm not<br>challenging the legitimacy of the<br>monastic lineage in Cambodia although I<br>realize the things I'm going to talk<br>about a little controversial and<br>personally I believe that once the state<br>has recognized a monastic lineage you<br>you need to recognize it as such I'm I'm<br>realistic I'm not going to say if you if<br>some little detail from the Vani is not<br>followed you everything is invalid<br>that's not my purpose<br>although there are subtle things going<br>on<br>uh in terms of the relation to the vinea<br>that that could be used to to question<br>to make things more complicated for<br>people and uh which is one reason I've<br>been rather careful about uh presenting<br>this material in Cambodia and so now<br>that I have three Cambodian monks<br>listening to my talk I'm wondering what<br>their response will be um but my idea is<br>not<br>to<br>challenge the current situation but to<br>show that<br>historically what took place was a bit<br>more complicated than has sometimes been<br>recognized so<br>um um so in term I keep thinking about<br>now in the talk<br>about dharmara from the first time and<br>then at the second talk about semas I<br>showed you that<br>uh that little sign in of a SEMA Hall at<br>dhar's Temple in New Delhi and it said<br>that um this seaal was was donated was<br>paid for by unu the prime minister of<br>Burma in<br>1955 and so I've been thinking about<br>what did that me mean and it meant that<br>in India um Buddhism was less well<br>established and the the Burmese in<br>setting up this seaall were hoping to<br>have more ordination of Indian monks<br>within<br>India um so in the case of dharmara well<br>we know he ordained at least a few<br>Indian monks but I don't think that<br>became a major point of of for<br>ordination of Indian mon<br>uh we know he ordained for example a<br>British a British monk there who lived<br>at his Temple for several years<br>um when when I asked a British woman<br>who'd lived at dhar's Temple for many<br>years I said about ordination she said<br>well in the case of the Cambodian what<br>you had was<br>cambodians leaving the monk Hood which<br>also involves a ceremony I don't know if<br>the ceremony for leaving the monkhood<br>has to be performed in a SEMA uh no I<br>don't think so yeah uh um but this<br>relates to some of the things we're<br>talking about and daravar actually when<br>he went to United States he did perform<br>ordinations I don't know if they were<br>beu ordinations or novice or novice<br>ordinations and in the early years of<br>say in the 1980<br>in the United States some of the<br>monks the cambod older Cambodian men who<br>became monks in the Cambodian temples in<br>the United States did ordain<br>with with davara in the United States uh<br>but under what circumstances I don't<br>know and whether those ordinations were<br>legiate I don't know and unlike the<br>ordinations we're talking about<br>today<br>probably it never represented an<br>ordination lineage the same we can say<br>about the ordinations and the refy camp<br>on the Thai border I<br>don't and someone might correct me I<br>don't believe these monks went on to<br>ordain other monks that it was something<br>that created a group of monks in the<br>refugee camps but perhaps did not become<br>a<br>continuing Astic lineage in the same way<br>that the September 1979 ordination<br>became so all of this I'm sort of<br>getting ahead of myself uh but to get<br>you an something of the idea of how this<br>uh<br>so yeah I just looked up dis rubbing and<br>you're correct<br>um it does not have to be<br>no you have to sit in front of a witness<br>who's in the right mind and then you<br>just say I renounce yeah it's pretty<br>easy pretty strong okay it's not a big<br>deal getting ordained is a big deal you<br>don't have a m you can just just R in<br>front of the Buddha Bud yeah yeah that's<br>all okay but it often is performed uh<br>with in a more elaborate ritual as well<br>yeah but you don't have to and that<br>makes sense yeah um and actually it does<br>say human witness and the<br>Vio yeah okay doesn't mean it ever<br>happen okay well I'm going to present my<br>paper now and this I'm drawing again as<br>I have been on the published article and<br>but hopefully we can we can depart<br>sometimes with a published article and<br>and open it up to discussion in certain<br>ways and I begin this article with this<br>quotation by Michael vicory Michael<br>vicory uh may not<br>be uh was an important scholar<br>of<br>uh of of Cambodia um<br>uh and uh um no I'm he wrote about<br>contemporary Cambodia his his original<br>research was more on Ancient Cambodia he<br>was an important scholar um uh but also<br>very political uh in ways that Wen<br>controversial but he had a book<br>about the People's Republic of campuchia<br>the the government of campuchia during<br>the 1980s um and in this he makes this<br>statement which I present is this is<br>sort of<br>what the interesting the word term I<br>want to do is standard total View and my<br>Michael vickory wrote about the popot<br>period and he criticized what he call<br>the standard total view which is what<br>the narrative that everyone says and in<br>this case what Michael vickory writes<br>here is sort of the standard total view<br>of the<br>ordination and this is what I'm<br>challenging this is what I'm saying<br>needs to be complicated but let's just<br>read it since all monks had been defro<br>under Decay that is the chish period the<br>first step in Reviving Buddhism was<br>through a new ordination procedures for<br>which specific ceremonies are conducted<br>by a traditionally defined group of<br>monks are<br>required no one even if previously a<br>monk May simply put on robes and declare<br>himself ordained and this is a<br>universally recognized requirement of<br>traditional Buddhism unrelated to the<br>politics of any state apparently in 1979<br>there were a number of such private<br>resumptions of Monk status but their<br>continued Toleration would not only have<br>undermined the policy of having religion<br>serve national interests but would also<br>have discredited Cambodian Buddhism<br>among the Buddhists of of other Asian n<br>countries thus an initial proper<br>ordination was organized by the front<br>and the<br>KPRC umare peoples I I guess I don't<br>remember what that means on 19th of<br>September 1979 with a pass with a<br>delegation sent from the Buddhist<br>community of Vietnam possibly from the<br>camb community in Vietnam whose temples<br>had not been closed by the Vietnamese<br>authorities after 1975 seven cambodians<br>all former monks 20 to 60 years of<br>service were<br>reordain and so my main purpose is to<br>show<br>that um these early ordinations were<br>actually did were varied quite a bit<br>from place to place and what they<br>represented the strategies they had but<br>they they actually did<br>attempt to meet the requirements of a<br>legitimate ordination and um and<br>in and should be recognized for what<br>they were in any case the situation was<br>more nuanced than you would think from<br>this description um so you're accusing<br>Michael vicory of having a standard<br>standard total View which he would have<br>resented well uh um but I think you're<br>right but yeah uh he would have bitterly<br>he was a very contentious person he<br>argued until the day he died he was<br>anything and everything I I<br>mean you there's no way we can express<br>how<br>but but those of us who had contact with<br>Michael Victory have there a lot of<br>stories about him and which is goes<br>beyond the um<br>uh the bounds of decent conversation yes<br>other things<br>um uh I right here I I see this ceremony<br>as in Continuum with the series of more<br>Grassroots ordinations that preceded it<br>the quote irregular ordinations that<br>occurred prior to this key September<br>1970 ordination have typically been<br>presented in the literature self<br>ordinations<br>um in fact however many ordinations<br>prior to September 1979 were far from<br>being simply self- ordinations<br>representing the ground swell of<br>interest in the reestablishment of the<br>monkhood and frequently with the support<br>of local authorities they were often<br>serious attempts to reproduce<br>traditional requirements they represent<br>the creative Spirit of that time the<br>widespread determination to make things<br>work after years of chaos they show more<br>than standard historical accounts of the<br>September ceremony assume that the<br>process was not simply impose from<br>above um<br>uh um<br>I I probably shouldn't should have<br>eliminated this slide i i in the slide<br>which obviously represents a<br>presentation from long ago I quote vber<br>and I see that this did not make it into<br>the published article um and this<br>represents my attempts to to put this<br>this work into to into some sort of<br>framework um<br>and writing about religion says that<br>sociology is a science concerning itself<br>with the interpretive understanding of<br>social action and thereby with a causal<br>explanation of its course and<br>consequences we shall speak of action in<br>so far as the acting individual attaches<br>a subjective meaning to his behavior be<br>it overt or covered amission or aquence<br>action is social in so far as its<br>subjective meaning takes account of the<br>behavior behavior of others and is<br>thereby oriented in its course well this<br>may take us too far a field from uh the<br>topic here in in the actual published<br>paper I talk about<br>um about rights of Passage<br>uh<br>um<br>uh<br>um uh and Charles kais who's my<br>um uh ambiguous gender male initiation<br>in Buddhist<br>Society um is a key work<br>in uh talking about ordination as a<br>right of P process um Francois bizo also<br>wrote about the ritual aspects of<br>Cambodian ordination<br>um here I'm more interested in looking<br>at ordination as a means for the social<br>legitimization of the monkhood and the<br>monk Hood's legitimization of social<br>institutions and beliefs at points of<br>historical<br>change<br>um we should keep in mind as well that<br>ordination lineage represents in<br>important ways a mechanism of the s's<br>memory the mapping of a relation to the<br>Past even when it is in fact Mythic that<br>and that ability to Define proper<br>lineage as a means of shaping that<br>memory as well as projecting its future<br>continuity uh there are cases of tervada<br>lineages that ended up ended and were<br>restarted often in the context of war or<br>political<br>upheaval narti situ the last important<br>king of pagan in Burma accusing the of<br>corruption declared and valid the<br>existing ordination Lage and sent monks<br>to Sri Lanka to establish a new pure<br>lineage um this was in quite ancient<br>times the most extensively documented<br>case is the dying out of the higher<br>lineage in Sri Lanka which after some<br>time was restored by Siamese monks in<br>the 18th century I'm sure Anushka could<br>tell us more about that looking at the<br>ins and outs of the 1979 events May even<br>shed light on these historical events<br>their basic interest lies first of all<br>in the fact<br>that from a Buddhist perspective a break<br>in monastic lineage is a major<br>catastrophe<br>and the reestablishment of lineage<br>becomes similarly an event of great<br>historical weight um I'm interested in<br>the tensions generated perhaps<br>inevitably by this process as this<br>process works itself<br>out uh I I was interested in the<br>Anthropologist Roy Rapaport uh who is<br>this scholar who has most systematically<br>work of the ways ritual relas to the<br>performes of speech act theories and<br>ordinations are imminently per formative<br>acts what I'm concerned with here is a<br>moment of rupture when different<br>performativities so to speak compete<br>with each other and when the state plays<br>a role in legitimating a central<br>performativity over other uh th is high<br>futing language uh but perhaps gives you<br>an idea of how I would conceive these<br>ordinations in in theoretical terms and<br>as I say my interest is<br>uh is not to take one side or the other<br>but to show a process<br>whereby whereby different actors<br>are are working out their own idea of<br>ordination in a way that which is<br>finally resolved by the state insisting<br>on one particular monastic lineage<br>um um in the published article I talk<br>about<br>the literature on what constitutes a<br>proper lineage and I'm not going to go<br>into that here uh uh those of you as<br>budologist will be able to access that<br>literature and<br>um and debate it and those of you are<br>monks will know this literature much<br>better than I can ever know it<br>um the need for ordination ceremonies in<br>1979 stem from the fact that the<br>practice of Buddhism was prohibited<br>Democratic<br>cuchia and mug monks were dis robed on a<br>mass scale common knowledge in Cambodia<br>holds it during this period Buddhist<br>institution were dissolved and all monks<br>were forced to dis robe and this is<br>largely true as we shall see One issues<br>the degree to which there can be said to<br>have been some monks who lived through<br>the marou period without abandoning<br>their vows this is not easy to<br>judge<br>uh uh Ian Harris describes the process<br>that unfolded after the 19 April<br>1975 meu's victory in which the highest<br>ranking monks were the first to be<br>purged soon afterwards those who resided<br>in the unliberated zones were forced to<br>dis robe finally in the last three<br>months of<br>1975 following the rainy season the<br>remaining monks from liberated zones<br>were asked to leave their orders Harris<br>gives a range of figures for the numbers<br>of men who remained Monks at the end of<br>the period from 100 which would have<br>included those who fled to neighboring<br>countries to a number given by the<br>minister of religion of 12 the issue is<br>Complicated by the fact that different<br>monks may have kept their vows to VAR<br>degrees uh a and by the way I should<br>mention that in when people write about<br>the poot period uh there's a narrative<br>says that uh all all monks were killed<br>during the popop period and that's not<br>true although many prominent the most<br>prominent monks uh uh uh<br>including probably all as I said in an<br>earlier lecture probably all the<br>Cambodia monks who had studied in India<br>for example uh when if they were still<br>living in Cambodia at the time of the<br>Popa period probably all of them<br>died<br>um<br>um um and yet the majority monks the<br>everyday monks uh had to leave the<br>monkhood uh and and interlay life work<br>as Farmers work as uh work in the new<br>socialist cooperatives that existed at<br>um and as I said a very small number of<br>older men in obscure pockets of the<br>country somehow<br>were by some miracle managed to stay<br>monks during the poot period<br>uh um I studied four sites where early<br>ordinations took<br>place two of these are of special<br>importance because they involve the<br>monks Nel mani and Chan sang who<br>performed hundreds of<br>ordinations and these are the cases<br>where I have most documentation however<br>two other reports of<br>ordination each based on a single<br>interview seemed significant<br>fora describing the trajectory of what<br>happened an early ordination near the<br>board of Vietnam and Eastern kapun Cham<br>and at tayot ordination in<br>Te<br>um the information I have about all of<br>these early ordination comes almost<br>exclusively from interviews and I<br>recognize that such accounts are subject<br>to the distortions of<br>memory where I've been able to interview<br>more than on person involved I found<br>contradictions however enough<br>consistencies remain that I feel<br>confident that I have a sense of a<br>larger<br>picture I would also stress that the<br>information I have comes from a limited<br>number of Cambodian<br>provinces and a more systematic<br>interviews throughout the country might<br>reveal other Trends although I I feel<br>like this is an a limitation of this<br>study that it's although I<br>it's now been several years since this<br>was published<br>and um in the article as a whole which<br>we may not be able to cover all of today<br>I I<br>did the ordinations I'm talking about<br>here most of my region was in kapun Cham<br>Province and Teel Province<br>uh uh I interviewed people in Theon<br>province which where there was only a<br>few novice ordination anav ordinations<br>are much easier to legitimate uh with a<br>single Monk and then there's a book by I<br>Harris who's another important scholar<br>of of Cambodian Buddhism who makes a<br>reference to ordinations that took place<br>in Baton bong uh although when I went to<br>the temple to try to learn about these<br>ordinations in bamong it did not seem to<br>support there being that pattern there<br>um<br>so there are other parts of Cambodia<br>where I don't know if anyone has ever<br>done research but my impression is that<br>the places where I did my research are<br>in fact the place where there was the<br>most intense activity of this kind<br>um okay so we'll go through these one by<br>one uh and uh<br>uh<br>um<br>well I have this map just to show you I<br>mean this is uh those of you who know<br>Elizabeth in her<br>research um know the term Campa Crown uh<br>um and KET Crown refers to the fact that<br>uh or my crown refers to an ethnic May<br>population in in southern Vietnam and uh<br>and their his IAL reasons for this that<br>uh the K were there before the migration<br>of the Vietnamese from the north uh and<br>uh although now it it's it's uh<br>politically and socially dominated by<br>ethnic Vietnamese population there's<br>still uh aare and ethic Cambodian C<br>presence in southern Vietnam and there's<br>also a and the C the ethnic May in<br>southern Vietnam we called my Crow<br>uh practic terada Buddhism just as in<br>Cambodia with with some variants and<br>there's also there's also a herada<br>tradition among ethnic Vietnamese as<br>well which comes to be a factor in our<br>whole discussion so um so this is<br>relevant because although under popot<br>there were no uh that Buddhism was<br>basically eliminated in Cambodia then<br>there were monks in Vietnam who<br>continued the tradition and this is<br>actually quite significant for the<br>history of<br>Buddhism of Cambodian Buddhism<br>especially when you look at Cambodian mm<br>for example in in the United States<br>among the Cambodian communities in the<br>United States and when Cambodian<br>communities began to establish Cambodian<br>temples in the United States many times<br>they drew on<br>uh Amro monks because so many of<br>Cambodian monks had been forced to leave<br>the monkhood During the popop period<br>they also Drew on Cambodian monks who'<br>gone to Thailand uh and this is all part<br>of our our<br>narrative um uh so the first case as I<br>said was um and this is one of the ones<br>that it's based on a single interview<br>and and as far as I know no one has ever<br>WR about this I've never found been able<br>to find any further documentation about<br>it but I I repeat this story as part of<br>the range of possibilities and and by<br>the way just jump forward this is a<br>slide about the types of ordination<br>Assumption of robes uh there<br>were these the different possibilities<br>those who simply put on robes without<br>any attempted ceremony and the<br>interesting is there are very few cases<br>of this this is what my victory was<br>saying happened and and actually<br>um seemed to been very rarely happened<br>perhaps with one exception of one<br>prominent monk uh number two is those<br>who assume the monkhood in a ceremony in<br>front of a Buddha image with or without<br>the sanction of local authorities again<br>this has very little<br>um uh support in the Vana although many<br>cambodians seem to think this was this<br>was also a legitimate way of of assuming<br>the robes uh and three those who are<br>ordained by men who claimed to have<br>never left the monkhood During the pood<br>period and these become more interesting<br>cases<br>and then for those who ordained by monks<br>who spent the popot period outside of<br>Cambodia whether cambodians or non-<br>cambodians and and by non- cambodians I<br>may mean um uh I may mean ethnic to<br>I may mean Tha or Vietnamese or it might<br>be an ethnic mayor from K crown for<br>example and find those who cross<br>National borders to be ordained at watts<br>and neighboring countries uh so um this<br>first case um when I wrote this this<br>monk venerable chanun was a monk<br>resident at a Cambodian temple in<br>Rochester<br>Minnesota uh who was a young monk prior<br>to the PO period I I believe someone he<br>was quite old when I interviewed him and<br>I believe someone told me he has by now<br>passed on and uh many of the older monks<br>I've done in I<br>interviewed my research are no longer<br>living<br>uh he the story he told me must have<br>been one of the earlier ordination<br>ceremonies he said it took place in<br>February 1979 in maym a district in<br>eastern kapun Cham near the Vietnamese<br>border<br>mayot was one of the places where<br>Vietnamese troops together with those of<br>the new Cambodian front entered Cambodia<br>at the time that the kou was overthrown<br>his story is interesting both because it<br>is early and because it gives a sense of<br>the way and the first flush of the new<br>era authorities encouraged reord<br>naations and people responded<br>enthusiastically he said at the time the<br>front entered Cambodia tracks were<br>scattered from the air giving the people<br>specific directives they told them to<br>return to their home Villages they also<br>said monks should reordain and<br>traditional Buddhist Customs be<br>reestablished a front official likewise<br>encouraged him to reordain and he<br>learned of arrangements to have a<br>ceremony in<br>mayot as venerable Chan recounted the<br>story the first obstacle he obtained was<br>obtaining cloth for monastic robes this<br>was a time of uh the PO period is there<br>was a time of great great austerity of<br>great suffering there was not food there<br>was not clothing there was not<br>anything um and simply obtaining cloth<br>for the ropes was difficult uh before<br>going to be ordained he went to his home<br>region in prang Province there the<br>people knew he had been a monk and when<br>they learned he needed the cloth they<br>were willing to exchange rice to obtain<br>it white cloth was available but they<br>had to buy saffron die on the black<br>market venerable Chan own said his<br>preceptor was a Cambodian monk named<br>daep who had fled to Vietnam as a<br>refugee he said the rituals performed by<br>22 monks that came from<br>Vietnam only tep was actually a refugee<br>from cabodi the others were from<br>Vietnam on that occasion only Chan and<br>two other monks ordained although he<br>knows that over time danp ordained many<br>others the ordination he maintains had<br>the approval of the front that is to say<br>the authorities of the new<br>regime even to the extent they organized<br>military forces to guard the ceremony<br>from possible<br>disruption following this he returned to<br>prang although he was later Under<br>Pressure to disrobe and reordain in the<br>officially approved lineage he never did<br>so so this story uh and again I've have<br>not been able to find any<br>other evidence supporting this story um<br>and normally as researchers we like to<br>have at least two sources uh um but it<br>does seem to show the early importance<br>of ordination to the front that these<br>the the authorities of the new<br>government did want ordination to take<br>place uh and um<br>and it shows<br>that these ordinations were not simply<br>self- ordinations it shows that local<br>community was coming together to support<br>the<br>project and okay case number two is Nel<br>man uh who was at a watt on the<br>outskirts of plumen called wat<br>samol and this is the most famous uh<br>perhaps the most important case<br>of a preceptor during this period<br>um<br>um and uh<br>and uh he was born in kapun Province and<br>he studied p in<br>kcham in the central poly School in<br>plumen during the last years of the<br>colonial period meaning he was probably<br>one of the better educated monks of his<br>generation uh I thing about nelman he<br>was uh he he had some respectability as<br>a monk uh he had some claim to be uh a<br>legitimate preceptor quite apart from<br>the fact that he decided to do<br>it um he was appointed to be an Abbott<br>and monastic District Chief in k k Cham<br>and was well established there by the<br>time the war broke out he was held<br>captive gorillas briefly in the early<br>1970s eventually fled to plumen to<br>escape the war he resided at wat UNAM<br>when the city fell and upon evacuation<br>went to rural wat in Kul where he had<br>friends one after another the other<br>monks and residents left the order in<br>1976 as he tells a story the cage<br>authorities asked him to disroe but he<br>protested that he could not villagers<br>warned him that this might result in<br>being killed but he persisted a week<br>later authorities told him that he did<br>not have to stop living like a monk but<br>they wanted him to dress as they did he<br>weighed in his mind the rules of vah and<br>concluded that he could reconcile to<br>himself changing his clothes without<br>changing his behavior during the rest of<br>the period he was never asked to do<br>heavy labor and he maintains was able to<br>follow the lifestyle of a monk he kept<br>his monastic robes in a bundle that was<br>already always on his person this was<br>the version he told to me uh he was also<br>interviewed by another scholar um Ian<br>Harris who in his book he says that he<br>says that nelman did leave the monkhood<br>uh um so there is this ambiguity uh but<br>he told me that what he told me was that<br>he kept his robes hidden in his clothes<br>and he maintained the the monastic<br>discipline during this<br>period immediately after the fall of the<br>of the karou he made his way back to the<br>area of pumin in the early days there<br>were restrictions on entering the city<br>and large numbers of people returning<br>from the countryside clustered in areas<br>just outside the city's boundaries he<br>gravitated to wat sansam casol which is<br>just outside the Dyke Road that circles<br>the<br>city<br>um<br>uh his story makes it clear that<br>authorities wanted at least the symbolic<br>reestablishment of Buddhism in the<br>country he said plumin authorities Act<br>ly sought out former monks for this<br>purpose thus he and four<br>others<br>ordained with a support of local<br>authorities in April 7th<br>um uh as he just and of course he's<br>claiming in some sense that he never<br>left the monkhood but he<br>ordained um thousands of people were<br>present as the five men ceremonially<br>Circle the vihara on Horseback in<br>traditional fashion and then enter Ed it<br>for an ordination ritual there was no<br>preceptor the ceremony was Justified on<br>the basis that it took place in front of<br>an image of the Buddha there was also a<br>copy of the<br>trtica delman in any case regarded<br>himself as never having left the<br>monk within two weeks men began arriving<br>from around Cambodia for further<br>ordinations and then Nel Mani at this<br>time began to assume the role of<br>preceptor<br>these ordination did not have as much<br>support from the authorities as the<br>first ceremony<br>did the authorities would have liked to<br>stop with five monks he said once they<br>had enough to show the foreigners thus<br>the process originally started with the<br>approval of authorities begin taking on<br>a life of its<br>own he describes what must have been a<br>negotiation with authorities and claims<br>a sort of success in the fact that they<br>let monks over who were over 50 years<br>old ordained this became became the<br>policy in the 80s that monks uh who<br>older monks were allowed to<br>ordain<br>um<br>uh in fact a few men under 50 did ordain<br>at this time including three<br>from uh Jung prai District who are who<br>at the time I was doing my interviews<br>were prominent monks<br>um<br>wat had begun opening up around Cambodia<br>and more and more B men began to arrive<br>at Watson samol to be<br>ordained a commune Chief who brought a<br>group to be ordained said that nelman<br>was at that time being called a<br>patriarch it was thus construed like the<br>later September ordination as a national<br>project Melman claimed that he ordained<br>some thousands of mons at this time<br>actually seems credible to me<br>um be given what other people have told<br>me<br>um if it's exaggerated even a fraction<br>of this number would be significant two<br>of what are now the highest ranking<br>monks in Cambodia samat nunet who is<br>still alive who's like the number two<br>ranking monk in cabodi now and S that L<br>who who is no longer<br>um were resident at Watson sosol and<br>ordained in the ceremony with<br>n according to n the robes were provided<br>by the trumpin party secretary van sen<br>and the minister of con comerce town<br>serin which indicates there was a degree<br>of State<br>support um nelman had sufficient<br>recognition that he was called on to<br>authenticate a document signed by 39<br>that was submitted as evidence in August<br>1979 trial in ABIA of popot<br>Ander the text indicates that there were<br>68 monks resident at Watson s<br>cul um samat L um who I interviewed<br>before he died was one of those who<br>arrived at Watson some sol in the period<br>after Nan's initial return to the sa he<br>describes Watson Sasol as a sort of<br>Wilderness at that time none of the<br>buildings were<br>intact he was a highly educated monk<br>before the poot period and forced dis<br>robe in<br>1975 and spent the karus period in the S<br>santor District of P<br>Cham after the fall of the cus he<br>returned to<br>plumen which he said was a fearful place<br>he stayed for a while at the home of a<br>former student he wanted to go to his<br>previous Temple W Muhammad tribe but<br>found it Des olate he learned that there<br>were Monks at Watson Sasol and went<br>there during this period he said there<br>might have been 30 40 or 80 ordinations<br>taking place per day he himself ordained<br>in a ceremony in which 80 people<br>participated<br>um um most of these monks returned to<br>their home districts after ordination he<br>he said there were only 30 monks<br>permanently resident at Watson subas<br>Hall<br>he he slept on the ground in a sort of<br>uh Dugout place under one of the walls<br>of the broken down with Hara um<br>eventually he ordained in the lineage<br>established in the September<br>ceremony and now accepts it<br>uh um but he indicated his sense of<br>importance of<br>the the time at Watson s gool<br>um and I think this indicated by the<br>fact that he he<br>continued L Li continued to live at<br>Watson Sam he he came to consider that<br>his home for the rest of his his life<br>um according<br>to nette<br>um four of the seven<br>monks who would ordain in the September<br>ordination um all of them except<br>for and<br>Kat had been previously ordained by Nel<br>mon okay this is uh I think this is a<br>time to take a break now<br>so let's say five five minutes or or<br>well at this point we often open it up<br>for a little bit of discussion do do<br>would anyone like to comment right<br>away yeah I just wondering um what do<br>you mean by<br>reation what do you mean um so that<br>means for a person I mean for a person<br>who's been for a while and then what is<br>mean bind reorientation that means they<br>need to they need to count like from the<br>starting point the<br>first first year of the monastic life<br>that they need to give up what it has<br>been doing for your whole life and then<br>start a new p is that what you mean by<br>reation well I think that the feeling is<br>that monks who had been forced to<br>disrobe in the popot period were no<br>longer<br>monks and so they were becoming monks<br>again and so uh they were they were yeah<br>they were starting as monks again uh but<br>they'd been monks before but they' been<br>monks previously so they they did count<br>I mean like they didn't count the<br>previous ordination<br>years they lost those when they were<br>dis that's my understanding I mean It's<br>Complicated by the fact that like<br>someone like<br>nman and I talked to now some of you may<br>know better than I do I talked to a<br>quite a distinguished um scholar of<br>Buddhism Luis Gomez uh and I said well<br>if<br>someone is<br>has to stop wearing the robes but<br>continues to follow the<br>discipline can they claim to still be a<br>monk and he said yes and so um the<br>someone continues in their mind to still<br>be a monk are they still a monk um but<br>the assumption is that all these people<br>once they gave up their robes were no<br>longer monks During the ppot period and<br>so these were monks who<br>had been been monks before<br>1975 and then after<br>1979 they wanted to become monks again<br>and so they reordain they became they<br>they performed some sort of ceremony<br>that made them monks again is that so<br>they<br>young men who wanted to become<br>mons they were like old men who wanted<br>to never wanted to<br>defog I see what you mean so you mean<br>during that period Cambodia like the<br>mons in<br>Cambodia were disr right almost all<br>almost all with very very few exceptions<br>like for you know taking the the orang<br>roof off right right even though they<br>don't<br>they don't they did not like there was<br>no formal ceremony but yeah they even<br>though they did not I mean like they<br>were did not reside or they did not<br>reside maybe some de this maybe some de<br>maybe there's a case in In<br>tha tha among yes was imprisonment yes<br>um so<br>basically people he was he was blame or<br>he was he was taken to the to the jail<br>yes and then like that MK<br>didn't did not even though he he was<br>like the Rob was taken out he wearing<br>the the white and he was still a monk<br>because he did not recite word to his he<br>believed he was still a mon yeah yeah<br>and there cases like that in Cambodia<br>there's a case like that right now in<br>Cambodia which I don't know if I should<br>get into now um<br>uh uh and this is the someone a monk who<br>created a number of temples in India um<br>and<br>um the authorities uh accused him of<br>certain uh<br>certain uh crimes let's say so uh and he<br>was forced to remove his robes and was<br>in jail for a while and he claims this<br>was totally<br>unfair and now he<br>has<br>uh I think he has he's he's returned to<br>wearing robes again I believe uh and and<br>claims that he was never justifiably<br>removed from the MCO okay and so there<br>are cases like this in Cambodia uh and<br>of course it's a very controversial case<br>um and but in the poot period<br>basically almost every monk in Cambodia<br>had to leave the monk Hood there might<br>have been at like I one thing I just<br>read that some people say there might<br>have been 12 monks who in in who somehow<br>managed to stay mons in the boundaries<br>of the country others others had fled<br>the country and so they remained monks<br>because they were no longer in Cambodia<br>but uh but L people weren't allowed to<br>bring them<br>food okay and then then they were forced<br>to work in the fields which breaks the<br>vine<br>roles and some were forced into the<br>military you and some were forced to<br>marry some were forced to marry and<br>although in Mass they had these Mass<br>marriages so I mean many of these were<br>young men who were might have left the<br>monkhood eventually anyway so the most<br>famous monks were were<br>killed okay like the S rajas the as as I<br>said<br>the<br>the the sangar rajas the monks with<br>titles<br>um were killed and<br>probably<br>the what I've tried to find about the<br>because my recent about the monks who<br>studied in<br>India um did any of them actually manage<br>to live through the Popa period and were<br>still alive at the end of the popop<br>period And I have not found<br>any evidence that any of them survived I<br>mean most of them we don't know what<br>happened there's no record uh I found<br>record of one of them who was in this<br>Fame this notorious torture Center uh<br>but most of them we don't know what<br>happened but they were not alive at the<br>as far as I know at the end of the P<br>perod so so some of the most important<br>monks were simply killed but most monks<br>simply were told you had to you had to<br>stop be bugs you have to go work work on<br>yeah this happened in China as well<br>right yeah it happened in China TI Japan<br>too Japan<br>yeah<br>political so what do you mean by the pop<br>period mean like during the cou yeah the<br>cou period from 1975 to<br>1979 so a period of<br>three three and a half years three years<br>and certain amount of days and which was<br>this radical uh radical period<br>of of com there very different kinds of<br>Communism and this was a particularly<br>radical uh communalistic type of<br>Communism uh<br>which uh which had its own strange<br>character and uh was was very disruptive<br>to Cambodia it sort of destroyed<br>Cambodia at the<br>time yeah but I think you can discuss<br>this later so I got some more question<br>but I think I can brought it after to<br>class you should take a break okay we'll<br>take a break now and so but no it's good<br>to clarify these things uh um early on<br>if there's some basic questions about so<br>so<br>I forgot how depressing it was<br>actually the pp here no the whole this<br>whole ordination issue yeah I sort of<br>thinking oh this is really interesting<br>and then I went actually it's depressing<br>s of gives you some insight on what<br>happened for example in Shri Lanka with<br>her when Saga died out the first time<br>because it was a TL invisions<br>and everybody just gave up and just s to<br>get this it must have been<br>terrible you know miserable I can I I I<br>know bit about 18th century because<br>there was only the second time yeah the<br>first time it was I<br>can't no but it was<br>terrible because you know monasteries<br>were destroyed<br>and people couldn't donate food and you<br>know social structure back down like<br>Buddhism depends on social structure huh<br>Buddhism depends on the social<br>structures being intact yeah it's like<br>they're very interdependent yeah L used<br>to cook food The Village Temple and Lake<br>Pagoda that kind of to help raise<br>money but these new groups I'm studying<br>they saying that s includes both lady<br>and<br>the yeah so they're not giving much<br>attention to<br>ordination saying that it doesn't matter<br>what you're<br>wearing so they have a Buddhist<br>Creed like a statement of belief like do<br>you have to say I'm a Buddhist not<br>really some of them are saying when you<br>say<br>I'm a Buddhist that's where you are not<br>a Buddhist that's what okay well okay<br>can argue<br>with it's just interesting yeah I kind<br>of like some of these groups yeah no I<br>mean some of these ideas are obvious you<br>know they<br>like but it's very controversial when it<br>comes to when you are saying it in a<br>very traditional way of Buddhist lineage<br>and all it's very controversial to say<br>that oh when like Buddha is coming in<br>front of you and if you can kill him not<br>literally but L not literally<br>but then you are a Buddhist so those let<br>go totally let go everything yeah<br>so yeah this are very controversial<br>sure and I'm sure people have always<br>thought about<br>this<br>huh I'm just my my son says he's just<br>picked up Freya so I can give you a ride<br>seminar after the seminar if you want to<br>I can look at that telegram thing I can<br>install it in his computer maybe you be<br>so grateful you know how works are you<br>young enough I think I can figure it out<br>stuff not it's like you got to sign up<br>and then you're gonna need a password no<br>you can I think if he if he has it in<br>the phone you can have like this barod<br>scan or something okay I think so we can<br>try that's exciting can try you I'm<br>worrying about that for<br>guys cuz he has this book by the sky<br>can<br>oh okay thank you you're uh Tech by yes<br>and you know in America maybe in English<br>in general there's this phrase you're a<br>gentleman a scholar which is very true<br>in literally in fely<br>uh<br>and okay um so the next case and again I<br>want to emphasize I was able to<br>interview Neil Mani when he was still<br>alive and the next case I was also able<br>to hunt down this person uh whose name<br>was chanan um and and it was harder and<br>this was the case as I said that I met a<br>monk I'd known for quite some time uh at<br>one point confided in me this was a monk<br>who had<br>been well who had first ordained in this<br>period and he told me that he had<br>actually ordained with his figure<br>johnon and he had never the authorities<br>would have liked him<br>to defro and reordain in the ordination<br>lineage but he had never done so and so<br>I hunted out this figure Chan<br>s and whereas no manyy has been written<br>about by another major scholar uh Ian<br>Harris I I'm the only one who have<br>written about Chan<br>song um<br>but in terms of the numbers of<br>ordination that he performed may be just<br>as important as the ordinations<br>conducted by Nel Mani Chan song was born<br>in 1940 and ordained in 1964 at watu and<br>Trang District so he was cons<br>significantly younger than<br>nman he was in his early 30s when the<br>commus took out control of the area<br>where he lived as a monk he was moved to<br>different wat in cot Province and was at<br>wat SAR and Kum when as he tells the<br>story he learned of aaru's plan to make<br>monks dis robe thus sometime either in<br>1973 1974 he decided to flee he left<br>Cambodia for<br>Vietnam he left with a young lay man<br>named Ren who was then only 17 years old<br>um who had been living with him for<br>several years as a sort of adopted son<br>actually when I hunted him down I was<br>able to meet Ren before I was able to<br>meet him they went to a large refugee<br>camp near the border run by a compet<br>chrome monk venerable Oman newu<br>however they soon moved on to wat in<br>swon and<br>anang in South Vietnam where the Abbot<br>gave him a position of authority and he<br>taught May literacy he spent five years<br>at this wad a period which included the<br>fall of the Saigon<br>government eventually Ren the younger<br>man also ordained at the time of the C<br>um at the time of the Karu incursion in<br>South<br>Vietnam the pair fled further from the<br>border and stayed at several other watt<br>in late<br>1978 chanon was advised of what was<br>happening by venerable umu Sonu and so<br>moved close to the<br>Border he and ren moved back to Cha soon<br>that is to say into Cambodia again poer<br>itself soon after The<br>Liberation sometime before the Cambodia<br>New Year's<br>holidays at first they only performed<br>novice ordinations which the rules for<br>performing a novice ordination are much<br>looser<br>um um<br>he um they petitioned V some knew for<br>help and he sent AAR Crown monk named<br>Mau from what da<br>beit and this monk U began helping them<br>perform beu ordinations but eventually<br>returned to<br>Vietnam with the understanding that Chan<br>song could continue as a preceptor<br>himself Ren recalls that the first beu<br>ordination may have occurred in June of<br>1979 Ren and kite aome monk who was<br>close to them were the crew sought in<br>the ceremonies that is to say they were<br>the the second in command the right hand<br>man of the preceptors<br>um<br>uh and older monks from the area served<br>as hatat that is to say the other people<br>in the team of preceptors there were<br>nine of them in total<br>the right to perform ordinations was not<br>was recognized at the provincial level<br>he claims although it was not recognized<br>at the national level Chan s claims to<br>perform 664<br>ordinations in most cases the men came<br>to him to be ordained often arriving in<br>Ox<br>carts however at times he would travel<br>to them and later he obtained a bicycle<br>for this<br>purposes the majority of the men he Ed<br>Dan resided in a handful of districts in<br>southern Teo occasionally he traveled<br>considerable distances including West to<br>comport Province and even once to<br>and Kong Province this was possible<br>because of a train fromen to kongan pass<br>to the part of te where he was living he<br>could travel Westward on the train it<br>was taken by car from kongan to<br>B thead the roads were destroyed during<br>the war so it was really<br>challenging to get around without a<br>tank so here's another case in which<br>ordination performed in the<br>first months following Liberation<br>and the fourth case I'm going to talk<br>about is the case of tayot ordination<br>again this is a case where I only<br>have one interview well I think I<br>was I went to another<br>Tom Tom temp<br>there only a few of them in the province<br>dist where I've done a lot of my<br>research and they told me about this man<br>who is what is now a a neighboring<br>District<br>um of<br>the<br>um the two orders have separate<br>ordination lineages while the ceremony<br>will take to place in t<br>Province it involves another Monk from<br>Pam who claimed he had never left the<br>monko during the pop<br>periods I recount this from the<br>perspective of a small group of monks<br>from Chun prai District who traveled<br>great Distance by foot to participate in<br>the<br>ceremony what I'm the story I've told is<br>based on interviews with a single<br>elderly monk who is one of those<br>ordained<br>but the outline of viny recounts is well<br>known<br>and and the story is told at at the four<br>Tam temples in what is formerly Jung<br>prai<br>District the Monk's name is C nin at the<br>time I interviewed him he was 80 years<br>old and he'd been a novice for four<br>years in his<br>youth most of his<br>life was spent as a rice<br>farmer but the suffering he experienced<br>under the K Rouge motivated him to<br>ordain in<br>1979 even though he had a wife and<br>children who were still<br>living his preceptor was another Monk<br>from the district who claimed never to<br>have left the monkhood During the karus<br>period a man named Pine<br>sen uh and pine sen is<br>also written about by by Ian Harris<br>although Ian Harris does not write about<br>this ordination<br>ceremony<br>um um the current Abbot of that Temple<br>says Pine meten was such an old man that<br>the karus just did not think making him<br>abandon his robes worth bothering about<br>it was pinen who ranged for a group of<br>men to walk<br>to to wat salong Andel Province near the<br>vietnames bo order it was journey of<br>well over 200 kilometers and it took two<br>weeks to get there and back the<br>ordination was performed by five monks<br>with pen as a preceptor the other four<br>had ordained two months earlier than<br>ethic May tamy ywat in<br>Vietnam the monk who assumed the role of<br>Kus was<br>mahen a well-known tamat monk who later<br>resided for a time at walum unalan<br>eventually me went to France I'm remiss<br>I uh myot pen was alive at the time I<br>was doing my research and I was never<br>able to interview him in France um seven<br>monks ordain won a young novice perhaps<br>in his 20s from<br>udong and the rest like K and older men<br>from Jun Pride District Upon returning<br>to Jun Pride District the contingence of<br>monks perform further ordinations<br>um okay I'm going to skip over a part of<br>my article which sort of takes things<br>from a different perspective and I I<br>talked about how my research was focused<br>on a monk at wat Pria in bti District<br>Punam and um and so in the next section<br>of the book I I look not from the<br>perspective of the of the preceptors but<br>from the perspectives of of monks I met<br>who who'd had this experience and this<br>monk who was this considered a senior<br>figure in bati District had basically uh<br>gone through four different ordinations<br>he had self-ordained in front of an<br>image of the Buddha then there were more<br>informal ordinations there in the<br>district which he took place within he<br>went to<br>nelman uh and pren and then finally he<br>took part in the ordination that took<br>place after 19 September 197 9 which<br>ordination there were other monks who or<br>ex monks who told me their<br>experiences uh they contradict some of<br>the story some of them were um like<br>the um the the monkai just talked<br>about um the monk<br>um Chan s claimed he had not interviewed<br>he not not ordained younger men actually<br>I interviewed a monk who claimed to been<br>a younger man who is who was ordained by<br>CH song and so a lot of things were<br>happening the Govern State policy was<br>not to ordain younger men and yet this<br>was happening too there was a lot of<br>flux a lot of confusion a lot of<br>contradiction in this period<br>um so let's go on to talk about the<br>September 1979 ordination which is the<br>the ordination which sort of has uh is<br>recognized officially<br>um here's a quotation<br>about the the ordinations On the Border<br>but here's a a photo from of the 1979<br>ordination I somehow I had this I can't<br>quite remember how I got a copy of this<br>photo um there recently on the internet<br>uh there have been and we don't quite<br>know where they come from other photos<br>from this this ordination have been uh<br>have been published uh this one this one<br>this is from a 1981 ordination and uh<br>somehow these photos have<br>been have been in the control of in in<br>the cambodi monk Hood although we have<br>it's only recently that we're getting<br>access to some of these photos um but<br>this was an<br>important event at the time<br>um um let me start by saying I belief<br>that there was no urgent need for the<br>September ordination ceremony if the<br>codian<br>authorities had chosen to recognize the<br>ordination performed by Neel man and<br>Chan Tong and perhaps other preceptors<br>this would not in itself have created<br>any crisis of<br>legitimacy and might in fact have<br>avoided some of the problems that came<br>to be associated with ordination process<br>that grew out of the September<br>ceremony that is I do not see any risk<br>of the situation described by victory in<br>the quotation cited above whereby quote<br>the continued toleration of these<br>ordinations would not only have<br>undermined the policy of having religion<br>serve national interests but would also<br>discredited Cambodian Buddhism among the<br>Buddhist of other n Asian countries<br>Chang's ordination could be criticized<br>on the basis of his lack of seniority<br>and scholarship as a monk now when he<br>had seniority and scholarship but there<br>were questions about whether he could<br>legitimately be said to been a monk<br>during the DK period there's in fact no<br>scriptural basis for saying that merely<br>not wearing robes perhaps the chief<br>basis for the Judgment that numone had<br>left the<br>monkhood constitutes in itself an<br>invalidation of monastic vows the<br>September ordination raises its own<br>questions well-informed cambod and<br>observers point to the scriptural<br>requirements that a preceptor had been a<br>monk for at least 10 years implying that<br>even though the seven newly ordained<br>monks had legitimately become monks they<br>did not yet scripturally have the right<br>to perform further<br>ordinations those who point this out go<br>on to State the obvious that despite<br>this technical violation of the rules it<br>was reasonable that they do so because<br>of the special historical<br>circumstances one could argue though<br>that if authorities had so chosen they<br>could have use the same argument in<br>defense of nman in Chang's rule as<br>preceptors my purpose here however is<br>not to dismiss the September ordination<br>which was a complex event in respond to<br>difficult historical and social<br>circumstances in the end a performative<br>act such as that of an<br>ordination is effective to the degree it<br>has social<br>legitimation and practice the sanction<br>of State Authority the sanction of State<br>authorities on the principle of yielding<br>unto Caesar that which is Caesar's it<br>had its own<br>justification uh as I've said I've<br>relied heavily on a Vietnamese language<br>account of this<br>ordination<br>um uh it was written by do trun hu a<br>Vietnamese official assigned to work<br>within UniFi Vietnamese Buddhist<br>groups he describes the decision to<br>perform the ordination ceremony as a<br>result of discussions between him and<br>the Vietnamese Central Committee Member<br>Swan<br>twe his account makes it clear that the<br>February 17 Chinese invasion of Vietnam<br>over the issue of its presence in<br>Cambodia was a conscious factor in the<br>decision to hold the ceremony they were<br>looking for ways to legitimate the newly<br>formed government cambodians do trun hu<br>argued to swanu would be grateful to<br>Vietnam the project as he described it<br>was originally conceived as involving<br>monks from other Buddhist<br>countries and if this plan had been put<br>into effect it might have been more<br>effective than it was Vietnamese<br>religious officials contact Buddhists in<br>Sri Lanka and India but they were<br>reluctant to participate doubtless for<br>political reasons Soviet and Mongolian<br>Buddhists would have participated but do<br>trun hu rejected this idea because they<br>were<br>monana<br>this this seems to been a connection to<br>um now I'm blanking on the name of the<br>association it's a a more socialist<br>oriented Buddhist organization which was<br>based in Mongolia and do you remember<br>the name of that uh I know what you're<br>talking the uh world world Buddhist fed<br>Federation for peace um and I've never<br>found any document that<br>specifically uh states that they were<br>involved in the 1979 ordination but this<br>seems to be the the umbrella under which<br>this was organized<br>um<br>um do trun Hugh's account gives the<br>impression that the decision to have the<br>ordination ceremony was largely made<br>twe um<br>and so we must recognize at least the<br>possibility that the event was planned<br>without much awareness of what was<br>happening on the ground in Cambodia such<br>as the ordinations by nelman and<br>chansang however it is equally possible<br>that do trun Hugh's account simplified a<br>process that involv consultation with<br>Cambodian Vietnamese officials at<br>different<br>levels uh this is at least partly<br>indicated by an August document cited by<br>gesman<br>um quote the leaders ship feared<br>accurately perhaps that newly ordained<br>monks might take advantage of the<br>situation and use Buddhism and the<br>belief of the people to go and conduct<br>activities to destroy the principles of<br>the pure Revolution to propagate and<br>divide National<br>Security the statement suggests that<br>security may have been a major factor in<br>the decision to create a new unified<br>monastic<br>lineage if<br>so officials were probably less<br>concerned with ordinations by nelman and<br>chansong than they were with the<br>the few ordinations performed by monks<br>crossing over from<br>Thailand whether or not the more formal<br>plan had yet been put in place in the<br>border camps to make a monk long<br>resident in Thailand the name of the<br>monk was<br>buoy uh and he became uh the preceptor<br>for ordinations performed uh in camps on<br>the<br>border the implications of this kind<br>were already evident at both sides of<br>the conflict um the September ordination<br>authorities promoted the idea of a<br>single monastic order that would not<br>distinguish between Mahan and<br>tamut by declaring ordinations invalid<br>all these early ordinations were either<br>declared as Mahan Kai or<br>tayot they promoted the idea that<br>Buddhism was a single unified system<br>under the guidance of the front since do<br>trun hu was already preparing a campaign<br>to unify by Buddhist within Vietnam this<br>agenda<br>um Cambodian Vietnamese authorities were<br>looking for Clear lines of monastic<br>Authority and a monastic bureaucracy<br>which if not necessarily dominated by<br>Vietnam would interface well with<br>emergency emerging vietnames re<br>religious bureaucracy they wanted a<br>monkhood that was to use Scots term more<br>legible than the chaotic one that was<br>emerging to the extent that what was<br>being invoked was bureaucracy and<br>legibility it was a very modern process<br>but it's striking that they felt the<br>need for Ceremony the Modern Nation<br>always is sometimes rather cynically<br>evoke the idea of continu with past in<br>this case it sought to evoke rituals and<br>ritual linked to the past one that also<br>somehow had to pass through the hands of<br>Vietnamese liberators<br>um<br>um<br>sorry do TR provides a list of 12<br>members of the delegation some of the<br>names are confirmed by other<br>sources the list includes five P that's<br>the ethnically Vietnamese monks from<br>hoim City for my chome monks from Ria a<br>retired scholar also from Maia the poet<br>Hau and another member of the delegation<br>of hoim city do listed only by<br>name the fact that key participants in<br>the ceremony were 10 that is ethnic<br>Vietnamese rather than kamro that is<br>ethnic is very sensitive in<br>Cambodia relating as it does the<br>historical fears of Vietnam dominating<br>Cambodian resentment of Vietnamese<br>presence in the<br>1980s and is systematically avoided if<br>not lied about when the topic of the<br>ceremony is is breached this is one of<br>the reasons it's difficult to find any<br>Cambodian uh account of the<br>proceedings the identities of the<br>preceptors becomes more complicated<br>concerns about their nationality are<br>perhaps ameliorated if we look more<br>closely at their lives um while the<br>three main efficients in the ceremony<br>probably would have identified<br>themselves and been identified by all<br>those pres at the ceremony as Vietnamese<br>terad is a relatively new and strange<br>practices among vimes who are<br>traditionally Mahayana Buddhists what I<br>prefer to emphasize you the degree to<br>which<br>any 10 Vietnamese terada monk as opposed<br>to<br>ethnic monk from it would also almost<br>have by definition of represent a sort<br>of cultural hybridity<br>um and here I talk in my paper about the<br>whole issue of paravada Buddhism among<br>Vietnamese which has its own what's<br>which was an innovation of the 20th<br>century has its<br>own history of a connection with<br>Cambodia some of the most prominent<br>terada ethnic Vietnamese monks had had<br>spent time in Cambodia so it's it's it's<br>a more complicated thing<br>than what may it seem I think the two<br>most senior monks of the September 1979<br>Bon<br>and are mentioned by Ben as other monks<br>who had studied in Cambodia and went to<br>bukang Temple in the early years<br>uh uh a third member of the delegation<br>sivet was Cambodian born and speaking<br>perfectly um this was the monk know in<br>Cambodia as<br>new CH usually<br>called<br>um uh and there were gen ambiguity about<br>his ethnic identity<br>um um<br>and<br>but another fourth her monk uh who<br>T was a disciple of Bon<br>and states that he did not speak my he<br>was then 33 years old and ordained that<br>debuchan in<br>1963 as a tervada monk he came to the<br>Vince's Bon's assistant and did not<br>originally expect to participate in the<br>ceremony is still living and is the<br>Abbot of fen Pagoda in Saigon a senior<br>member of the Vietnamese Buddhist<br>hierarchy and a frequent participant in<br>international Buddhist conferences<br>um another member of the delegation was<br>the Mahayana monk venerable mencha who<br>did not participate in the actual<br>ordination like Bon he was a senior monk<br>with a high profile having studied in<br>Sri Lanka and India for 10 years um and<br>incidentally in Vietnam he studied at<br>Nava nand mahavihara which we talked<br>about last time<br>um uh um but he was there as an observer<br>and not uh<br>preceptor um the names of the four Kamai<br>Crown monks were Dand noan danan and<br>D according to venerable Dand they range<br>in age from 27 to 31 years of age he<br>said it was almost an accident that they<br>were chosen to participate in the<br>ceremony<br>um according to one k Crown monk from<br>the area there had been protest in the<br>early 1970s by kamarro monks against the<br>South Vietnam government<br>and the ties between the K monks and the<br>Communist Party may have been stronger<br>there than other parts of the makong<br>delta in other parts of Southern<br>Vietnam my crown Buddhism tends to be<br>hostile toward the Vietnamese government<br>but not in this area and by the way I<br>did in my research manage to make it to<br>this area Ria and was able to talk to<br>one of these monks who<br>participated which became very<br>complicated and created a sensitive<br>situation with vietamese<br>authorities the seven Cod monks ordained<br>were c k Province<br>ofun<br>ofal the cambod news agency account<br>translated by summary of world broadcast<br>said that those ordained quote had been<br>monks for 20 to 60 years before they<br>were defro by the ppot period in<br>Click according to proc in uh the<br>selection was made by the Central<br>Committee of the front the two principal<br>criteria according to nette were that<br>they had been monks for long periods of<br>prior to the marage period and had never<br>married some political consideration<br>must have entered into the decisions as<br>well according to former Cambodian prime<br>minister of Van who I was able to<br>interview when he was still alive he<br>found T vong the eventual head of the<br>Cambodian sa dressed in white on the<br>grounds of a temple in c r in June 1979<br>that he asked him to come to<br>pumin there Tong stayed for a few days<br>at the headquarters of the front and<br>then went to live at wat after it was<br>cleaned<br>up pens saan said he told tap to assume<br>saffron robes<br>and in so far as we have any<br>documentation he did so without any<br>further ceremony as soon as they were<br>brought from Vietnam this is a<br>controversial uh issue for those<br>critical of self- ordination<br>um according to pring all of the monks<br>except for T and KATV had probably<br>ordained previously with Nel<br>Mani KATV another figure who had some<br>claims to having never abandoned his<br>monastic vocation during the Popa period<br>also came to plump in in robes according<br>to K man who claims to have accompanied<br>him TI also mentions this detail tapong<br>had already assumed robes when he<br>traveled to the Soviet Union Mongolia<br>earlier that same year and in August<br>when he issued a statement at the time<br>of the trial of poot and<br>ineri Tim remembers that t was already<br>wearing saffron robes when he met the<br>delegation of monks arriving to perform<br>the ordination ceremony in September<br>2009 now Mani was invited to reordain<br>with the other monks but refused in his<br>interview with me he suggested that he<br>was unwilling to renounce his previous<br>ordination a stance that excluded him<br>from the new ordination lineage and<br>um so um<br>try to go quickly like previous English<br>language students of the ordination I<br>Rely heavily on the short news reports<br>and summary of world broadcast for basic<br>information about the event I've also<br>been able to learn some details from<br>interviews with persons who while not<br>present at the ordination would have<br>been well informed at the time the bulk<br>of my description however in so far that<br>provides details not previously written<br>about comes from my interview with the L<br>ritual specialist at the time at watom<br>where the ceremony took place<br>pring and from the Vietnamese language<br>account by do trun hu as I said pring<br>was the father of my of my student and<br>assist<br>um these two sources are quite<br>consistent with each other although they<br>differ on two major points the name of<br>the preceptor and the circumstances of<br>death<br>Bon um my interview with venerable tin<br>provided only a few new details and in<br>general follows the account by doong<br>hu<br>um a according to the Vietnamese News<br>Agency broadcast translated<br>by um summary of world broadcast the<br>delegation of monks that performed the<br>September 79 celebration ceremony uh<br>came at the invitation of<br>the um K mayor National united front<br>uh in as Central Committee the<br>delegation arrived by plane on September<br>17th CH Sim the head of the front<br>who who was still living at the time I<br>read wrote this article headed events<br>organizing committee dun hu recounts how<br>Chim prostrated himself before the monks<br>at the airport and how some Vietnamese<br>communist experts who were present<br>expressed their announce saying a<br>communist bowing again to monks the<br>delegation stayed at Central party<br>headquarters although they took their<br>meals at wadon Alam<br>uh<br>um I I'm going to skip over some things<br>um<br>um then the crisis a central crisis of<br>this F was that venerable Buon fell<br>ill and and was taken to Plum hospital<br>where he died on September<br>21st um D Trung hu writes that he had<br>suffered from liver illness for some<br>time and had already had an operation<br>for this problem<br>1967 his symptoms had recurred before<br>pman trip but he was determined to<br>go um<br>pring told me that Bon was injured in an<br>automobile accident and was taken back<br>to hoian city where he died so there<br>inconsistent versions of how he<br>died and this leads to speculation of<br>ill<br>play<br>um um a website critical of Vietnam<br>policy toward religion gives the story<br>of an automobile accident<br>since Pro in said that the authorities<br>tried to keep this information getting<br>out and maybe that he<br>himself was not allowed to know what had<br>happened and he's based what he told me<br>on stories he heard later um in any case<br>the death of one of the<br>principal um persons in this uh has<br>created an eror of Suspicion around the<br>whole<br>event in the absence of<br>Buon became the<br>preceptor in D Tron Hugh's version of<br>Vince the other two Vietnamese monks<br>Viet and he and Tom were<br>became crus that is the the two<br>principal efficients of the perceptor<br>and the four micr monks were hot they<br>they were the remaining members of the<br>team that performed the<br>ceremony the ceremony began at 9:00 in<br>the morning at wat<br>Alam the Press agency account stated<br>that<br>Chim uh I I may have this quotation<br>uh Chim made a speech in which he<br>recalled that under the poot Inu regime<br>Buddhist monks had been despised and<br>treated as beasts monasteries had been<br>transformed into arms Depot stables and<br>places of torture and detention<br>Believers had been forced to renounce<br>their faith and monks had been defro<br>those who opposed the regime had been<br>killed PR in told me that he had<br>experienced in sewing and personally<br>prepared the robes for the seven monks<br>the political authorities attending the<br>ceremony provided tea food tea and sugar<br>festives lasted until two the following<br>morning as do trun hu recounts the story<br>he and<br>tiam stayed behind when the other monks<br>flew back to hoian city and accompanied<br>land I quote the journey was rough and<br>difficult and we were vulnerable to<br>attack by the Karu at any time therefore<br>our security detail was equipped with<br>serious Firepower one group of them rode<br>point and another covered our rear and<br>we didn't arrive until 2 in the morning<br>1979<br>um in the Years following the ordination<br>there was some exchange between the<br>Vietnamese and Cambodian Buddhist<br>communities with monks from Vietnam<br>visiting cambodi and delegations of<br>Cambodian monks visiting Vietnam a<br>positive interchange which nevertheless<br>is it related to Vietnamese political<br>and Military dominance over Cambodia<br>during that period would later sometimes<br>be<br>questioned the seven newly ordained<br>functioned as a group to perform further<br>ordinations and reestablish the lineage<br>in<br>Cambodia initially according to pring<br>Kat V the oldest was the<br>preceptor Prat D and den serun were crus<br>and the remaining four were kanaka s uh<br>now here this<br>picture is of an ordination that took<br>place<br>in bamong in 1981<br>and uh this was posted recently on<br>Facebook and I haven't examined it clar<br>bit it seems like the monks in the front<br>were the committee who performed<br>the performed as preceptors in this in<br>this ordination uh the team of of<br>preceptors um<br>in 1981 or earlier by some accounts<br>because KATV was growing old t<br>v assumed the role of preceptors even<br>though he was the youngest of those who<br>first ordained sometimes monks would go<br>to pend for<br>ordination if there were<br>enough men to be ordained in a certain<br>area the ordination team sometimes might<br>travel there it took consider time<br>before the process of reestablishing the<br>lineage was complete and during this<br>period many watt were populated with<br>monks would undergone unauthorized<br>ordinations and<br>unauthorized ordinations continued to be<br>performed as early as November 1979 Tong<br>declared that those assuming the robes<br>must be former monks over 50 years old<br>with quote clear biographic no blood<br>debts that is say no crimes of violence<br>During the pood period period and no<br>responsibilities due toward a wife or<br>children under the new procedures<br>candidates for the monk hod had to be<br>approved by the front and those to be<br>ordained received some education about<br>the proper role of the monk in society<br>before the ceremony took place also<br>there was no longer to be a division<br>between Mahan and tomat sex instead men<br>ordained as quote patriotic monks under<br>the supervision of watt committees<br>linked to the front and organ ization<br>pattern similar to what was found in<br>Vietnam in the course of the 1980s T<br>vong would emerge as the most senior<br>monk in the country with later political<br>change and the return of prince nordom<br>cuk in<br>1992 the S would once again be divided<br>into Mahan and tayud and Royal titles<br>were reestablished Tong was named mahiki<br>patriarch and a monk who had returned<br>from France bu Cree became the Tom<br>patriarch over a period of 5 days<br>beginning on June 2nd 1992 some thousand<br>monks were ordained into the tamot order<br>in ceremonies performed under Bodhi Tree<br>in front of wum and<br>plen this ceremony performed by bue as<br>preceptor and nine other monks Cambodian<br>born monks resident other countries<br>mostly Thailand in<br>2006 T was named PR<br>Mah<br>sarati or great Supreme patriarch which<br>gave him authority over the two<br>orders at the same time s net was made<br>patriarch of the mahiki order<br>um um I I think I'll skip over I I have<br>a section in which I discussed what<br>happened to these early preceptors uh<br>um<br>uh<br>um cely in Buddhist terms the breakdown<br>of a monastic lineage or its restoration<br>are events of historical importance<br>perhaps the investure of a monastic<br>lineage as an enduring social<br>institution can never be totally<br>successful without implicit or explicit<br>sanction of the<br>State ordination as ritual as great<br>personal meaning to the lives of those<br>who ordained and a web of meaning that<br>extends to the lives of their family<br>members and to the life of the Temple<br>Community as a whole at the national<br>level as kaai equin Weber bber has<br>frequently reminded us religion is<br>deeply involved in the legitimation of<br>both society and the state the vents in<br>Cambodia highlight the degree to which<br>the state is deeply linked to the<br>process of<br>ordination both in the degree to which<br>the State legitimizes ordination and<br>vice versa in so far as ordination is<br>further linked to the process of<br>bureaucratization it is a very modern<br>institution in the degree to which the<br>September 1979 ordination was a step in<br>the direction of setting up the state<br>bureaucracies that would continue to<br>provide an organizational structure for<br>religion it was<br>successful but in so far as it aimed to<br>be something more a performative charter<br>cemoni legitimating the new state its<br>effect was more<br>ambiguous certainly it did not as do<br>trun hu had hoped create in Cambodia a<br>sense of gratitude toward the<br>Vietnamese the impact of this September<br>ordination was diminished by the fact<br>that the organizers did not succeed in<br>attracting participants from other<br>tervada countries and the death of the<br>one terada monk in the delegation with<br>an international reputation meant that<br>it was harder to say that the preceptor<br>was chosen for a special status rather<br>than merely because he was Vietnamese<br>the discussions among do H and<br>joim uh the evening prior to the<br>ceremony indicate that there was already<br>some awareness of the Vietnamese<br>perceptor would be perceived negatively<br>that Vietnamese participation in the<br>event has been kept<br>secret has meant that in whispered form<br>it has been part of the discourse used<br>against the<br>state um the kin terada monks that is to<br>say the ethnic Vietnamese terada monks<br>who participated in the<br>represented in reality very complex<br>identities and that they practice a<br>religion more closely associated with<br>Cambodia than with Vietnam they're<br>having pointed out the problem as an<br>indication of their sensitivity to the<br>Cambodian perspective they<br>represent the fluidity of national<br>identity as much as its essentialization<br>and yet in Cambodian historical memory<br>to the degree which they are remembered<br>all they are quote Vietnamese<br>monks and the framework of James Scott<br>seen like State the lineage set up by<br>the September ordination may be seen as<br>an attempt to make the S more legible to<br>the state but the process certainly<br>didn't make the state legible to the<br>monkhood in the sense of accessible and<br>understandable rather the different<br>levels at which The Narrative of the<br>ceremony operates an official version<br>and whispered alternative versions has<br>tended to obscure the conception of<br>state power and make it appear alien and<br>vaguely corrupt to the Cambodian public<br>the ation of nil manich chansang and<br>others show us that there was nothing<br>inevitable about the September ceremony<br>it was not needed either because of the<br>requirements of Buddhist scriptures or<br>because the general Cambodia population<br>lacked in genuity in finding ways to<br>recreate the monkhood while it would be<br>a mistake to overly glamorize their<br>ordinations they were very meaningful to<br>the people involved at the time they<br>represent some of the creative communal<br>spirit that flourished in the immediate<br>aftermath of of the marish period the<br>fact that these ordination Traditions<br>were not allowed to continue perhaps<br>merely proves that the establishment of<br>a state legitimated order will<br>inevitably have human<br>costs but it is wise not to completely<br>forget those human costs okay that's my<br>paper<br>um okay<br>well um this is<br>uh um my take on this uh my research<br>which I I I stand up for there are other<br>people have written about this period<br>And I I I really think that my account<br>of this period is the most uh most<br>careful although some people might<br>disagree with that um<br>so I I know<br>for there's people on video who are<br>Cambodian monks and then the people and<br>they one situation and and they have<br>they have strong opinions about things<br>I'm talking about here and then the<br>other people I'm afraid have been<br>overwhelmed with a whole bunch of<br>of of of detail things which don't<br>necessarily mean that much if you don't<br>already know something about amodia and<br>so um but<br>let's open it up to some more discussion<br>if we<br>can<br>um let's can I ask if the<br>venerables know these stories that<br>John's telling have you heard them and<br>stories yeah yeah um I think most<br>Cambodian Buddhist M are we of the<br>history especially after the kamou and<br>uh exactly like uh Professor<br>just uh described uh in in in the<br>lecture I think pretty much uh uh<br>accurate uh and uh but I'm I'm not sure<br>that uh the picture that you just show<br>uh uh about<br>uh the previous picture of Buddhist m b<br>I think that that picture is if I'm not<br>wrong perhaps it's older than the 1981<br>it because we weren't sure it just<br>showed up a few days ago actually this<br>is it was<br>recently this one I believe that this<br>picture is older than the 19 81 perhaps<br>before my and if I'm not wrong but I'm<br>not sure as well well uh I don't I I<br>need to go back and the truth is it<br>these appeared these last photos the<br>ones with the these are fair numbers on<br>them and then next to on the posting on<br>Facebook it it lists the names of the<br>people in the pictures and uh like this<br>one as well and I I I admit I have not<br>looked carefully at this but because the<br>sorry sorry because the who sit uh in<br>front of the group I believe that his<br>name was uh pun P if I'm not wrong again<br>and but it looks similar<br>to<br>vable one of the most prominent scholar<br>in the B Province and but it look very<br>similar to to yeah<br>I I've had well but he was killed during<br>the yeah well that's very interesting of<br>course and I admit<br>that these pictures uh and you may know<br>better than me or the other<br>venerables theyve been only been<br>recently published by on the Facebook<br>page of uh of What's called the<br>canat canat L song I I probably have<br>that wrong and and the the Facebook<br>postings don't really tell us where<br>these photos came from<br>uh and so but they seem to but in the<br>description uh written next to the<br>photos then they this one does say uh<br>unless I'm<br>mistaken it does say 1981 ordination<br>ceremony in bong uh but I may be wrong<br>and<br>I again I probably maybe shouldn't have<br>posted this because<br>these these were only recently posted on<br>Facebook and and I I can't I don't know<br>really where they came from or or really<br>who found these pictures and posted them<br>I I admit that but I assumed that they<br>were they they came from the Cambodian<br>San and whoever posted them really knew<br>what they were posting but I cannot<br>independently verify that and so I'd be<br>interested in any comment that anyone<br>would like to make about these pictures<br>and so I I haven't really been able to<br>look that carefully at these pictures<br>but<br>it it was fascinating to me because we<br>seem to have had so few pictures from<br>this period and suddenly these were<br>there on on the<br>internet<br>yeah<br>interesting maybe we can send you the<br>link and maybe you know more about the<br>poster that that would be you said but<br>but you said have have you seen these<br>pictures before because<br>I I have never seen this picture before<br>but I I I saw a Buddhist man who sit in<br>front of the group I I saw his picture<br>before because he was quite famous yeah<br>Cambodian budhism especially in bong<br>Province but I'm not 100% sure that that<br>is but it looks so similar to me and uh<br>yeah perhaps but not this picture but<br>another picture I can send you yeah I<br>was traveling in India when actually<br>Elizabeth is the one who first saw these<br>pictures on the internet and sent me uh<br>uh this one I think was the first one I<br>received and then and then I was talking<br>to Cambodia monks in India and then they<br>seemed to be getting the same pictures<br>um and uh I so this is something that<br>appeared on the internet within the past<br>month and so I I I guess I was looking<br>for other pictures to make my PowerPoint<br>more interesting but um and also to find<br>out more about about these pictures<br>because you know like often when people<br>post they don't put the<br>Providence absolutely and the only way<br>you find out is by<br>asking indeed indeed<br>yeah I I will send you the link of<br>Buddhism that I am talking about that<br>that that that I said he looks similar<br>to to him yeah he<br>bud I believe there's a book a bi<br>biography about him yeah indeed I think<br>you might have read it somewhere else<br>yeah but it look quite similar to me<br>yeah<br>yeah um so I I think all the old<br>pictures of the monks are important<br>because we don't know their histories if<br>they disappear during the K Rouge time<br>we lost them so how can we get them back<br>what what I'm trying to say if if that's<br>P if these pictures was him or if he was<br>in this picture so this pictures my<br>older than 1981 because he was killed<br>during or before myou that's what I'm<br>say how about some of those other ones<br>because they look like the same kind of<br>photograph this one's different I have<br>no idea about the other ones this one<br>more contrasty but the other I believe<br>what I've been told this picture was uh<br>that the person who' acquired originally<br>had gotten it from Tian Tom who was the<br>Vietnamese terada monk who had<br>participated in the ceremony but now I<br>can't quite remember how I even got that<br>I believe there was a German woman who<br>had writing a doctoral thesis who had<br>access to these pictures but um she was<br>hesitant to make them public and I<br>believe this is genuinely well I think I<br>showed this picture to<br>um to<br>people perhaps proing the the man who<br>participated in the ceremony and he was<br>able to tell me<br>who the different pit people in the<br>picture were and this one I really think<br>is is from the 1979 ceremony um but I<br>yeah that is that's L I'm gave it to you<br>at the<br>FMC that's what your memory I'm I'm not<br>actually sure if that's what happened<br>but um I'm I'm I'm sorry to interrupt I<br>I I sent the link of uh the picture of<br>one page into Zoom chat and I think you<br>can look at that he's a first it looks<br>similar to uh to the one in that<br>picture so where's some of those older<br>ones on there you know the ones that I<br>sent you that we don't really<br>know well the I was just looking for<br>what you sent me I thought these were<br>the only ones that I found yeah there<br>four yeah that one's the oh yeah that<br>one to go back one more that one so that<br>looks like the same building the same<br>day the same<br>that looks like it could have been the<br>same uh the same event and I believe the<br>it's identified in the Facebook posting<br>c yeah yeah we have I think we need to<br>find more Source about it yeah yeah I'll<br>I'll send you the link right now thank<br>you yeah you know I like I always<br>comment can somebody please tell me the<br>Providence and they never answer so it's<br>like<br>Okay I accept<br>it okay well<br>um warma you said you had more questions<br>you you want to yeah um so let what I<br>understand is that um before the took<br>place um the<br>theik was introduced to Kam by that time<br>yes since the 19th century and there<br>were there<br>were their own<br>um yes yes which is like Mahan nikaya<br>right yes before the Mika was introduced<br>and then<br>um I I'm just<br>wonder<br>if any chance had been made through like<br>the<br>ordination process between two SE after<br>the<br>Kam yeah uh they made them in one and<br>the tamut still<br>there no at this time at this time<br>well one I I talk about four cases of<br>the ordinations in 1979 which were later<br>rejected by the government and one of<br>them was a tomat ordination where they<br>went to the the Monk who were in kcham<br>Province walked a long distance to the<br>border with Vietnam and Tommy and I<br>guess there are not very many H temples<br>in ethnic and Vietnam but there are a<br>small number and according to the monk I<br>interviewed they did perform the tomat<br>ordination in early<br>1979 so these early<br>ordinations were recognize the<br>distinction between Hamot and Mahan Kai<br>but the September<br>ordination made a conscious effort to<br>eliminate this distinction they said<br>that there would be no distinction<br>between tamot and Mahan Kai so from<br>September 1979 until 1991 I think it was<br>possibly<br>1992 that the<br>the<br>um the Cambodian monkhood made no<br>distinction between Mahan Kai and tamut<br>people who talked about it said well in<br>effect it was Mahan Kai but the official<br>government policy was this was a unified<br>sa which did not distinguish between<br>Mahan and tamut in<br>1991 there was uh Paris peace<br>agreements uh<br>signed in Paris whereby there was there<br>was going to be an<br>elaborate uh United Nations Mission and<br>in<br>Cambodia uh which would bring about<br>peace as that was the plan and at that<br>time<br>cuk uh who was the former leader of<br>Cambodia who<br>had well he was he was King but he<br>abdicated 1955 but he was still regarded<br>in some way as a king So when Ceno came<br>back then as a gesture of<br>reconciliation then the Toma was<br>reintroduced in Cambodia and so in it<br>was just in the article but I can't<br>remember the date and say perhaps in<br>1992<br>then they the time it was officially<br>reintroduced into Cambodia and that was<br>at the same time that the royal family<br>was coming back and<br>eventually cuk would be made King again<br>and so cuk became king and the tomat was<br>reestablished as an order and a monk<br>from who'd been resident in France named<br>buree became<br>the the patriarch of the new Amat order<br>and he had never been<br>defogged he was in France so his lineage<br>was but among other complicated things<br>was the fact that he previous mahai and<br>at this point became Tomia but I mean<br>these are things okay okay no I'm sorry<br>I should have kep my M excuse me and I<br>but I've never understood exactly how he<br>could have become Tom when he was<br>previous manai but sorry but um May<br>converts what maybe he convert maybe he<br>converted and whether there was a second<br>ordination I don't know but uh which<br>there would have had to been I think but<br>um uh and anyway but now there is a<br>tomat again in Cambodia so there are two<br>order once again as before the war<br>there's the two orders yes and then um<br>each SE has their own ordination righted<br>they cannot they're not allowed to<br>participate in the ordination and for<br>for official ceremonies you cannot have<br>a mixture of monks from the two orders<br>the<br>same yeah yeah same as Ty yeah yeah but<br>well when there is a event so they can<br>actually join okay the I mean the king<br>would invite to yeah actually actually<br>that may be I mean if there were really<br>say if<br>um a state visit with uh<br>say uh say the<br>the president of France visited Cambodia<br>there would probably be a state ceremony<br>in which the heads of the two Buddhist<br>orders were come and then at in<br>2006 at one time but again what all this<br>means I don't know it was 2006 when<br>there used to be a patriarch of the<br>mahiki patriarch of the of the tamut and<br>then 2006 it was decided that tapong<br>would<br>become uh<br>saraja well he was already used the term<br>saraja but he<br>became a patriarch above both orders and<br>uh and and uh and some people said that<br>was a way of uh in a way it was a way of<br>removing his power in that before as<br>head of the mikai he actually had more<br>on the ground power and now as had of<br>the two orders he was symbolically above<br>them all but but the Patriarchs of the<br>two orders in some ways had more on the<br>ground power but that's just what people<br>were talking about at the time and uh<br>and now Tong is quite old and quite ill<br>and there<br>is uh there is fear that he might he<br>so<br>any<br>questions so well we've<br>run you know I I started this seminar<br>thinking how am I going to<br>possibly talk for for even<br>more than an hour and a half and now the<br>second day in the row it's been two<br>hours and a half so thank you all for<br>staying with us and okay so tomorrow is<br>um I'll be talking<br>about<br>uh links between<br>Cambodia Cambodian Buddhism and Buddhism<br>in India and Sri Lanka um I'm there<br>really three interrelated phenomena<br>there's the phenomenon of Cambodian<br>Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka and India<br>and there's the issue of uh Cambodian<br>monks who are resident in these temples<br>or some of them are there as students<br>and the third issue is pilgrimage groups<br>or Buddhist tourism groups who from<br>Cambodia who are<br>visiting Cambo India and Sri Lanka<br>and and for those of you are well I<br>think you all have the<br>um the packet with the list of readings<br>and um for one of my articles about<br>Cambodian pil pilgrimage groups in India<br>and Sri Lanka I used videos that are<br>available on the internet and<br>my suggestion for the people<br>participating in this is and the links<br>are in your course curriculum it just if<br>you have time just these are you could<br>spend hours and hours looking at these<br>videos um but if you have time look<br>maybe 10 or 15 minutes at one or two of<br>these videos get an idea when I was<br>doing my research I spent for a while<br>I've watched a lot of these videos and<br>some of them are they're moments when<br>they're extremely interesting and their<br>moments you know most of them are are<br>pretty routine and uninteresting but I<br>think it would be interesting just to<br>take a look at these videos if you have<br>some time in addition to in addition to<br>the<br>readings okay so uh thank you all very<br>much and we'll see you tomorrow is the<br>last the last day it's like you get a<br>survival ticket for getting through five<br>seminars in one week so okay and this is<br>I press this this<br>it<br>okay<br>yeah it's<br>leaving I mean do you think<br>what can it can it be a valid<br>s is Ked got a valid<br>S I think we're still in I think we're<br>still in<br>so recording yeah it's still recording<br>yes so I said leave uh it's<br>not no I think we've left yeah maybe if<br>off the<br>left<br>yeah just close a<br>do<br>you how do you stop it<br>stop we we press that and uh that's<br>right yeah just to be sure yeah yeah<br>that one down there we did press that I</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
