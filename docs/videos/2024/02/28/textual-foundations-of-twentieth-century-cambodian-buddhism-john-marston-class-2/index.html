the German too we'll<br>translate it at oh that's good like we<br>said we cannot do this without those<br>yeah yeah I didn't realize she had that<br>wrong see see but I'm not arguing and<br>Nini B do you know who that is<br>Nini B she's a she also WR about she she<br>hung out with um s po who saos the<br>Cambodian philologist okay are we<br>already online yeah go you've got four<br>other people online okay cool okay so<br>should I do an introduction again or you<br>can introduce yourself John okay so um<br>no I I'm just curious you can ask them<br>to turn the videos on if you like yes um<br>would you know how to turn the videos on<br>when oh they can do it themselves they<br>have to do it themselves okay okay yeah<br>so um yeah what you give an introduction<br>again okay because I will have to stand<br>up and myself<br>okay so okay uh welcome to day two of<br>our uh is Tech seminar RS<br>521 and um if you were here yesterday<br>you'll have already heard this but we're<br>lucky to have professor John marsten<br>here um he has just arrived from India<br>where he's been doing field workor and<br>before that he was in Cambodia but<br>usually he's in Mexico so we've we've<br>captured him for a few weeks to come and<br>talk to us about his uh research on 20th<br>century Buddhism and uh Focus again on<br>Cambodia but also looking at Sri Lanka<br>and India so I will um John marsten is<br>an<br>anthropologist the first time we've had<br>an anthropologist doing these Buddhist<br>text seminars and um it's a bit of a<br>change because the way he looks at text<br>is different than the way a text spellar<br>would love to text so I will turn over<br>to you John and thank you for<br>coming well greetings everyone um here<br>in the room and online and so<br>um this is day two of my talks and um<br>this one is a little bit different than<br>the others and I was specifically<br>encouraged by Elizabeth Guthrie to give<br>this talk about semas it's based on um I<br>have a publication in this book which is<br>the translation of a of a text a<br>Cambodian text on semas from the 1930s<br>and so so this is of this is the talk<br>that is most<br>truly a talk about text and it's also in<br>some<br>ways<br>the the talk that's furthest from what I<br>normally do as a scholar and so<br>um I<br>um so my approach to this will not be so<br>much to talk about the text itself as a<br>translation<br>the the translated text is to talk about<br>how I came to do this translation so<br>this is going to be a little bit uh a<br>little bit different and<br>um<br>um and but I hope for those of you are<br>here who are interested in text this<br>gives you some sense of the complexities<br>of the translation of text and the<br>analysis of text and um this is all Al a<br>text which has its<br>own um its own complexities in the way<br>that it's a Cambodian text and yet is<br>relate related to the P<br>tradition um uh so um again I emphasize<br>that I do not think of myself as a<br>textual scholar um in the way that many<br>budologist are um and the truth is I<br>come to this not really as an expert on<br>semas although I hope I hope that those<br>of you who are present who perhap who in<br>many cases have more um academic or<br>personal experience about about semas<br>may may contribute to the discussion and<br>and so this can be not just my<br>presentation of expertise but but a<br>dialogue about what semas can be and<br>what text about Seas can be<br>um<br>so despite this despite this and despite<br>the fact that part of what I'm going to<br>tell you is that this was a difficult<br>process for me and um I have my<br>ambivalence about the whole experience<br>of doing this um this translation and<br>the editing that resulted in its<br>publication but despite this uh I hope<br>that the end product with a with input<br>of Jason carbon and Eric<br>Davis uh and does give us a<br>more a<br>thorough understanding of the CMA<br>controversies in Cambodia which I end up<br>discussing in my<br>introduction um and I hope this will<br>have some interest today this may be a a<br>shorter talk than some of my other talks<br>um so<br>I as I say I think many of those who are<br>attending this both in person and on<br>line are are PE our experts in Buddhism<br>experts in and who really do know a lot<br>about texts about semas um just so my<br>own attempt at an<br>explanation uh seus is a practice rooted<br>in the Vana text of the trtica it<br>defines say Sacred Space that figures in<br>key rituals Elizabeth do you realize<br>you're on the video no I don't want to<br>be on the video sorry yeah if you turn<br>your off turn turn off your um camera<br>be uh okay and as I say the text<br>I'm the text I end up publishing is from<br>this book uh it's it's a new book it's<br>quite I would argue it's a a significant<br>new book about about the nature of semas<br>and the editors of this book WR about s<br>sem as a ritualized boundary often<br>installed around a specific building in<br>a terada Buddhist temple complex semas<br>are foundational in many ways monastic<br>semas are required for the community of<br>monks to be able to perform their work<br>and to reproduce themselves in<br>ordination in Tera cultur semas are<br>traditionally agreed upon boundaries<br>required for ordinations and other legal<br>acts of the Buddhist monastic Community<br>now as at the end of our last session we<br>did have a little bit of discussion<br>about semas and as Elizabeth used said<br>that um in other religious Traditions<br>there are as we know from Mia alad and<br>that<br>there's many Traditions have have an<br>idea of how Sacred Space is defined um<br>and this should be seen as related in<br>some ways to the ways religions Define<br>Sacred Space but the SEMA tradition is<br>very<br>specific and coming out of poly<br>scriptures and has is a very specific<br>tradition within paravada<br>Buddhism what I would like to emphasize<br>is that this is uh text is a practice<br>among monks but one of the things that<br>makes semas interesting is that it comes<br>to have social implications and legal<br>implications that and political<br>implications that go beyond beyond its<br>merely religious implication and uh so<br>what I write here is while the Sean<br>defining sacred spaces of its Essence a<br>religious practice and link to the<br>Buddhist s it in practice as often the<br>defining space had social political and<br>legal implications that go beyond merely<br>religious practice and the way carbin<br>and Davis write it<br>is as physically and<br>ritually uh established boundaries<br>engagements and reflection on Semus are<br>by no means limited to ordained Buddhist<br>monks non- monastic actors including<br>politicians business actors and other<br>social figures have in continued engag<br>age and intervene in SEMA practice in<br>ways both common and significant and so<br>I hope that will come out eventually as<br>I go over my introduction to this<br>chapter<br>um so again uh many of you who are<br>actually attendant know have seen semas<br>in practice and I'm in the<br>Anthropologist I've never as an<br>anthropologist systematically looked at<br>SEMA practices<br>and I do happen to have some pictures<br>from my<br>fieldwork uh what I want to emphasize is<br>this this was not a full-fledged<br>SEMA uh SEMA ceremony what it was was an<br>Asam site that in rural Cambodia that um<br>that was was used to create a<br>temporary temporary vihara which could<br>be used in<br>rituals and later this site<br>was later the site was superseded by a<br>real vihara and so I happened to be<br>there for this ceremony establishing<br>semas that were considered<br>temporary um but you see many of the<br>elements you would see in a a more<br>full-fledged ceremony notice on the<br>picture on the left you have the the<br>markers um which are and some of this is<br>is particular to Cambodia although there<br>are similar things in other terad kundas<br>country see the the markers on the left<br>um which would be above the ground um<br>and yet um ball would be the true marker<br>of the semas do I have a picture of the<br>ball I guess there yeah that's some<br>they're wrapped in bags uh a stone<br>marker which goes into the ground um<br>notice that a hole is made at the<br>cardinal points eight eight cardinal<br>points are the the eight directions<br>around the temple and at this point the<br>hole is still a hole with a little cage<br>around a little bag in which the balls<br>will be dropped um um at this stage that<br>um in a more full-fledged ordin uh<br>ceremony which and perhaps in this as<br>well people will put donations of of<br>books or money or other other sacred<br>objects into the hole where eventually<br>the stone will be dropped um sometimes I<br>believe that this is not doctrinal that<br>some blood will put into these and into<br>these holes as well if I'm not totally<br>making that up um that um now<br>now the and this relates to questions<br>about the texts which we'll be talking<br>about in our introduction that in the<br>Buddhist text the original po text was<br>clearly defined that there would be<br>semas in the north south east west<br>southwest Northwest northeast<br>southeast um but what is not defined in<br>the original text was a a central a<br>central Sema<br>uh which occurs in the middle of the<br>temple and uh and here in the second<br>picture you see the hole which will be<br>for the central SEMA uh Stone uh which<br>is a source of controversy among people<br>who are trying to have uh the pure SEMA<br>practice consistent with the Buddhist<br>scriptures um so here you see the<br>um the stones wrapped in cloth I guess I<br>don't have a picture of the stones<br>outside the cloth you can see how how<br>the holes are arranged around the the<br>little thatch pray he obviously as I<br>said a temporary beara um and the the<br>role of of women uh doni in this case<br>very prominent I think there were there<br>were not yet that many Monks at this<br>Temple<br>um uh and here you see that um the the<br>stone is suspended by a bamboo pole over<br>the hole and at a key moment in the<br>ceremony this will be cut and the stone<br>will fall into the hole and um in actual<br>in<br>Cambodia in when it's a full-fledged<br>SEMA ceremony this the The Cutting of<br>the Rope letting the stone fall into the<br>hole will be done by uh a high ranking<br>official often often the prime minister<br>of the country and or the king of the<br>country in the times when there was a<br>king um<br>so the SEMA ceremony<br>has a political framework as well as a<br>religious framework and so I hope these<br>pictures at least give you a rough idea<br>of what is a more elaborate ceremony<br>when it's done with a full-fledged<br>vihara uh which takes place over several<br>days so um I as Elizabeth mentioned I've<br>recently been to India<br>um and so I just thought I'd add some<br>pictures um to me in all my work what<br>I'm generally fascinated with is is the<br>ambiguities of the situation and and<br>things like um what do you do when<br>things change and semas are not so<br>clearly defined as they once were um so<br>yesterday I talked about a mon named<br>dharmar Maha who founded um in either<br>1947 or<br>1948 a temple on the outskirts of New<br>Delhi which was called the isoka mission<br>and daravar was a terada monk he always<br>identified as a tera monk terada monk uh<br>even though he he had connections with<br>other traditions and in and in the India<br>of the Buddhist tradition the tadas have<br>more Association than they would with<br>Mahayana Buddhist than they might in<br>other countries and over the course of<br>the years his Temple um and and among<br>certain communities this is a<br>controversial thing became uh came to be<br>headed not by ter monk but about by a<br>laki monk who's the head of the temple<br>at the present time a very Advanced age<br>and so in effect the temple which might<br>have once been considered a tervada<br>temple has become a Tibetan uh a temple<br>in the Tibetan tradition so<br>um uh now on the left this is blurred<br>even if you had uh I I've seen pictures<br>of this before but this was my own<br>picture on this recent trip that this is<br>a building was called the SEMA Hall and<br>it was<br>um this building was sponsored by unu<br>who was the Prime Minister of of Burma<br>in<br>1955 if the letters I seem blurred but I<br>believe in 1955 although I've seen it<br>written as<br>1954 in any case it was in the early um<br>early 50s it was a time when Burma and<br>India were both uh were both newly<br>independent countries and um<br>and um<br>and and this Temple was newly<br>established in some ways it was a time<br>when dharmara was sort of at the high<br>point of his power and influence if you<br>can say that about a Buddhist monk and<br>um the interesting thing about this SEMA<br>is that it's still there does it still<br>function in some way as a SEMA is it<br>still a Sacred Space in the same way and<br>and the the little plaque identificate<br>this is a as a seaall it was a place for<br>ordination and certain ceremonies um and<br>when I asked people about what happened<br>to this building that it became um and<br>you can see in the other pictures if you<br>look carefully there're the stone<br>surrounding the the there's still the<br>seam of markers around the building it's<br>a small building it's small other than<br>it's not a vihara um it it's a special<br>hall for SEMA which is I think also<br>there's a question this would not be the<br>tradition in Cambodia uh that in<br>Cambodia it would be a vihara it would<br>have certain functions and but this was<br>a building dedic intended to be<br>specifically as a seimo hall um and uh<br>what I was told was that at a certain<br>point um<br>when darh mavara left India he kept<br>coming back but basically he was gone<br>after about<br>1975 then there was a a law monk who uh<br>who was officially the head of the<br>temple for a while and uh and he there<br>was another person who was managing the<br>temple and eventually the the ladaki<br>monk came uh and what I've been told is<br>that this was where the L monk lived it<br>became not a hall for ordination but a<br>residence but a residence for a terab<br>about Monk and then at the present time<br>it's the residence for Al ladaki n again<br>this doesn't seem necessarily<br>inappropriate um<br>uh although someone said in some<br>traditions women did not enter the enter<br>the um the SEMA space but<br>it's uh in even in a varara in Cambodia<br>there might be monks who are living<br>within the varara so the fact that it's<br>a residence doesn't seem problematic to<br>me but it shows that something's happen<br>that this space is still memorialized in<br>some sense because it was donated by unu<br>and<br>yet uh<br>this this SEMA space is not something<br>recognized laki tradition I believe and<br>and so it becomes something different um<br>here's another space for my travels in<br>India I mean it's many of the temples in<br>India are associated with one country or<br>another I was mostly visiting Cambodian<br>temples and this is a this is in the<br>city of shasti a very important uh<br>Buddhist pilgrimage site and um this is<br>a rather complex temple in the sense<br>that uh the monk who founded it um who<br>was known as L mahab was um born in what<br>what we consider Cambodia but um it was<br>a part of Cambodia that during World War<br>II was was controlled by by Thailand and<br>uh this monk was actually educated in<br>Thailand in some ways was considered a<br>Tha mon when he first went to India he<br>had a taian as for and and so he built<br>this Temple when this Temple was first<br>built it was considered a a Thai temple<br>and over time it has become a c cons<br>considered a Cambodian Temple and<br>um uh so uh it has the SEMA markers as<br>you can see if you look carefully and<br>these probably date to the time when the<br>temple was originally built now I I<br>wrote my<br>assistant um and I again my intention is<br>not to be critical but I said this is a<br>temple that currently has no monks and<br>residence my assistant Cambodia said<br>well if there are no monks and then in<br>some ways it's not a temple and I said<br>but but it has it's defined as a SE by<br>Seas it's also defined in the fact it's<br>registered as a temple with the Buddhist<br>authorities in India and so um it's also<br>because this is a temple where<br>pilgrimage groups come and many times<br>there are monks with them and so<br>ceremonies are performed with monks in<br>this Temple uh and and yet what does it<br>Define it's not a spa I doubt whether<br>it's been used for ordination for<br>example for many years what do it<br>defined uh what does it mean what are<br>the ambiguities of this this SEMA space<br>and yet it still is a reference point it<br>somehow in my mind at least legitimates<br>the temple U uh and and makes it<br>something more than it might be<br>otherwise and and yet there's the<br>question of whether is still<br>actively uh a<br>space uh a SEMA space whether the the<br>sacred character is still can still be<br>actively acknowledged so<br>um okay so I'm going to show a few<br>slides before I read the before I I<br>present the<br>um before I present the introduction to<br>my chapter which is which is this main<br>substance of my talk today and this<br>these slides I hope give you some visual<br>reference for the kinds of things we're<br>talking about because in a way we're<br>talking about three moments in time<br>because the booklet that I translated<br>was actually written in the 30s um this<br>was at a time when Cambodia was still<br>under French colonialism and but there<br>was there were reform movements there<br>was publications of books about Buddhism<br>whereas before most the Buddhist texts<br>were Palm L manuscripts and there were<br>there was new attention to the<br>importance of<br>of the poly scriptures uh attention that<br>perhaps CA Cambodia before this moment<br>had had not paid quite the same<br>attention to the poly scriptures as<br>texts per say as a basis for the<br>religion perhaps that's an arguable<br>statement um<br>so so<br>um<br>the but<br>I find this text relevant for<br>understanding the ordination<br>ritual the complexities of an ordination<br>of a SEMA ceremony that took place at<br>wat UNAM wat unalam is the<br>administrative center of the<br>Mahayana sect of Cambodian Buddhism uh<br>um it's a plumin temple uh it's where<br>the M Mahan patriarch is resident um and<br>we see that on the left we see the<br>temple as it<br>existed um uh<br>in during the French Colonial period and<br>then if you look at the temple it says<br>that the date of the establishment of<br>the new Temple is<br>19 well 2500 in the Buddhist era<br>calendar which would be<br>um<br>1957 in the western calendar um which is<br>when the Buddha Janti<br>2500 ceremonies celebrations took place<br>in Cambodia and in fact this seems to be<br>when the new Temple was<br>begun and the SEMA ceremony that we're<br>talking about did not take place until<br>the 1960s so um but this new Temple was<br>a project that began at the time of the<br>Buddha Janti celebrations which had<br>their<br>own um uh Mythos surrounding them had<br>their this own suggestion of the<br>beginning of a new era um uh and a new<br>type of Buddhism that um<br>that and which perhaps attempted be a<br>pure Buddhism a pure relationship<br>between Buddhism and the state that<br>existed before<br>um so John you you you've um you you've<br>Advanced your slide I think maybe<br>prematurely but maybe you<br>yes there we<br>go okay but I am going to the next slide<br>now okay but um the picture on the left<br>is the temple as it existed during the<br>French Colonial period and on on the<br>right you see what allowance it exist at<br>present time uh which was identified as<br>having building began in<br>1957 but was not completed until the<br>1960s so the SEMA ceremony we're talking<br>about we will talk about took place in<br>the<br>1960s<br>um okay now I'm going to talk about my<br>own connection with this well let's just<br>pop ahead<br>to<br>um the the<br>1957 year was the year of uh of the<br>Buddha jante the the<br>201500 anniversary of of the Buddhist um<br>the Buddhist achievement of Nirvana um<br>and this was celebrated throughout the<br>Buddhist World perhaps particularly in<br>the uh in the terab world um at this<br>point uh in many countries like India<br>and Sri Lanka this is part this was<br>celebrated in 1956 because of different<br>ways of interpreting the calendar it was<br>celebrated in Thailand and Cambodia in<br>1957 at this time A Relic was brought<br>from Sri Lanka a stoa was built in front<br>of the Railway Station it was a major<br>celebration um and so this<br>was we talked last time about nordom Nom<br>at this time was still a young ruler he<br>had abdicated two years earlier but he<br>was still in effect the the real ruler<br>of the country here we see him carrying<br>The Relic that was going to be installed<br>in the stupa at that time the newa uh<br>here is uh COK with his on the left uh<br>uh uh as a a young man uh uh and his<br>parents after he abdicated his father<br>became the king and um and after his<br>father died his mother had who was<br>always Queen had this sort of ambiguous<br>relation role uh and but was in effect<br>the the king while cuk remained the<br>person who really wielded power um okay<br>let's go back and I'll talk<br>about my own involvement in this<br>translation project and which itself is<br>rather strange um uh at that time I<br>was in Cambodia and I was I was<br>contacted by Jason carbon uh who is uh<br>at that time was still quite a young<br>scholar who'd gotten his doctorate at<br>University of Chicago um and in Buddhist<br>studies and um he asked me if I could do<br>a translation of a Cambodian text on<br>semas and he was had a uh he was a<br>consultant to a a court case in having<br>to do with a Cambodian temple in Lowel<br>Massachusetts and um this was a dispute<br>between two factions fighting for<br>control of the Cambodian Temple and I<br>still don't know the details of this<br>dispute and I um what I've been told is<br>that the two factions were both in this<br>building and one was upstairs and one<br>was<br>downstairs and I tried to find out which<br>side wanted the wanted the SEMA text<br>translated and why what was their<br>argument for wanting this text<br>translated and up to the present time I<br>still don't know that um but the point<br>is that in many cases questions of semas<br>become relevant for questions disputes<br>about control over over a temple um<br>eventually I know that one at least one<br>of the factions moved and created their<br>own Temple elsewhere in the LEL area and<br>that's all I can say is that um but<br>Jason commissioned me to do this<br>translation I did it together with my<br>with my um with my research assistant<br>whose name is T and her and it was a lot<br>of work it was I was perhaps over my<br>head and yet um and I could not have<br>done it without the help of my research<br>assistant and yet we learned a lot and<br>at the time we all said oh<br>gee wouldn't it be great if this could<br>be published and and I think Jason<br>carbon was saying the same thing um and<br>so<br>some years later you know we' totally<br>forgotten about it then Jason and<br>another uh quite important scholar of of<br>Buddhism who's also an expert on on<br>Cambodian Buddhism uh were putting<br>together a an edited volume devoted to<br>the issue of of semas and um they<br>approached me and asked me if if we<br>could publish this text that I<br>translated uh quite a few years earlier<br>together with chu and hu and I said yes<br>thinking that it would be an easy<br>publication it it end up being quite<br>complicated um for various reasons and<br>um uh so again this is the book I'm<br>holding up which I highly recommended<br>for anyone who wants to study about<br>semas<br>um um<br>and where to be begin um uh I believe<br>here's now this book the text I was<br>translating was originally written by an<br>important Cambodian Buddhist scholar uh<br>who eventually became the patriarch um<br>this is this is I think yesterday we<br>already began talking about um about<br>chat and who uh they were closely<br>associated with each other they were um<br>early scholars in the French Colonial<br>period they um I think the story is that<br>they were they were quite close uh as<br>friends even in the early days they they<br>were they had a hunger for learning<br>about Sanskrit they learned Sanskrit<br>from an Indian Peanut Vendor in this<br>would might have been in the early 20th<br>century eventually they they went to<br>Hanoi to study Sanskrit and uh with with<br>Scholars they were they became<br>professors in the poly School in uh in<br>in pen which had been established by the<br>French partly as an attempt to to<br>provide alternatives to to Buddhist<br>education that was taking place in sayam<br>um they they became associated with the<br>reform movement um<br>which is which is there's a whole<br>literature about this and which I'll<br>talk more further on uh that is to say<br>they were interested in<br>using um hly text as the basis for<br>practice um and within a certain<br>tradition the the reform movement<br>relates to reform movements that were<br>taking place in Thailand at the same<br>time um this more senior figure was Jun<br>not but his younger colleague uh who<br>became the head of<br>the of the poly School uh and eventually<br>after junat had became the patriarch of<br>the<br>mahiki uh sect<br>um uh that these are towering figures in<br>the history of Cambodian Buddhism um and<br>it was H Tau who wrote this text we're<br>talking about in the<br>1930s um maybe I'm getting ahead of<br>myself because I believe this is now<br>what makes this the translation complex<br>is that the text is in M language and<br>and yet is a m text that summarizes<br>materials that were written in poly um<br>so here here's something that we wrote<br>in the introduction to the to the<br>translation given that Hut text is a<br>summary of it at times even<br>translation of poly passages there's a<br>certain Semitic complexity to the<br>exercise represented by our translation<br>approaching in places a translation of a<br>translation our goal here is to<br>translate to the best of our ability the<br>CH wordings and phrasing acknowledging<br>that the chare passages use and refer to<br>poly terms and sentences or chare<br>versions of poly words the pamphlet<br>represents local tradition in the<br>process of conversing with and<br>representing translocal sources while it<br>is not entirely clear which versions of<br>the Vana the author and reviewers of the<br>Chex utilize references to poly sourc<br>text poly Tex as side editions are given<br>in the notes as well as to places where<br>those poly texts are well translated by<br>others these reference helps show the<br>parallels and departures between the<br>text even if some issues remain<br>unresolved um so um so what I'm saying<br>is that when I originally translated the<br>text um I was attempting to translate a<br>text I'm not a schol scholar of poly and<br>so but once we once we<br>began uh submitting the text showing it<br>to other Scholars and uh a major<br>contributor to this book is Petra kefir<br>pz who is a major uh scholar of poly<br>with an emphasis on on the SEMA<br>tradition then there became the question<br>of where where what seemed like an<br>adequate translation from the chare the<br>English um but did not necessarily<br>reflect a good translation of the P then<br>then what do you do and uh this um was<br>not easy thing to resolve and I I fought<br>saying this is aext not a poly text but<br>uh it shows the complexity of the<br>situation uh and uh my praise for the<br>editors uh and there were times it would<br>seem like we're just going to give up on<br>the whole thing but um I pushed partly<br>because they were the ones who had<br>invited me to submit this text and I<br>already felt like I'd put a lot of work<br>into it<br>and uh uh Jason carbine and Eric Davis<br>had to put a lot of work to basically<br>for all these terms um uh if there was<br>any inconsistency between the chare and<br>and the poly to have footnotes<br>explaining this is the and this is this<br>is the ply so if you if you ever work<br>with this text and uh you will see it's<br>actually a rather uh complex thing<br>because it is in some sense a<br>translation for the CH which is also<br>somehow um aware of the translations of<br>of the poly and this created um<br>some it ended up being a lot of work for<br>several several people and I'm grateful<br>that in the end uh uh Jason carbon and<br>Eric Davis were willing to put that work<br>and help me and and we were also of<br>course continually checking the command<br>translation to be sure that was accurate<br>as well um so um all this was at the<br>same time we<br>were we were trying to deepen and the<br>the introduction and to find a better<br>sense of the social context of of this<br>text and the way the text is<br>very um the text is sort of based<br>and and so there's also the question is<br>what is the interest of this text<br>and uh and they were pressing me to go<br>further in my introduction in the end um<br>uh I'm grateful for Professor Guthrie uh<br>that um that as I was trying to take<br>this further she was helpful in helping<br>me look at it more deeply and find other<br>sources for looking more deeply at the<br>implications of this of this text and as<br>you see we begin to realize that um<br>there's these questions about what the<br>reform movement meant in Cambodia what<br>did it mean that Hut and junat were<br>emphasizing hly text at this moment and<br>there did it mean a change in actual<br>practice and as as I read the<br>introduction to this this chapter you<br>can see that the people who have written<br>about this text who've written<br>about uh have different interpretations<br>even for what this text signified in<br>Cambodia and so I hope that in the in<br>this introduction we get a sense of that<br>um some of that complexity so um here's<br>another picture of of who taught um and<br>that actually it was Elizabeth who who<br>saw this online and sent it to me a<br>while back and it's interesting that<br>this happens to be Adam SEMA ceremony um<br>in<br>1953 um the dedication of the monks<br>hospital um that this relates to um the<br>something we talked about yesterday and<br>that um when the there was um the tour<br>of the relics of mokana and<br>saruta of that came to Cambodia in<br>1952 um the the funds raised at that at<br>that time the donations were partly used<br>to were partly used to to fund a<br>hospital for monks that was dedicated<br>the following year and darhar we talked<br>about last time was apparently a present<br>at this dedication ceremony as well but<br>here we see five of the most prominent<br>monks of the time uh the figure at the<br>very left is junat and the figure in the<br>very centuries is H um so<br>um okay well I'm going to let's leave it<br>there uh so let's I'm going to go into<br>this uh the introduction to the<br>translation uh<br>or well maybe this would be time for a<br>break should we take a break<br>now you want a break yeah yeah yes so<br>let's take a break now and then come<br>back in five or 10 minutes okay so I've<br>got some show and<br>tell so this beautiful books about SAR<br>and<br>Tai from a manuscript so they had<br>manuscripts about SEMA I mean they<br>didn't wait for printing they they<br>already had their own manuscripts and<br>there were some of them were<br>Illustrated and um<br>this yeah what yeah there are a lot of<br>many<br>versions in the<br>leella in the leella yeah yeah and the<br>Beautiful it's beautifully it's an art<br>book basically um but you know I suppose<br>the point I'm trying to make is see are<br>a big deal they're not just some big<br>deal biggest deal they're the biggest<br>deal and then this this book is the U<br>it's a feta copy that I slept with for<br>when I was doing my PhD under my pillow<br>every night I GNA sit um about the<br>importance of bourage ritual SEMA<br>rituals in in Cambodia<br>because um so it's an art history book<br>by metalin Jito it's referred to in this<br>this uh article of John's<br>um and she's all about the the markers<br>the nimita the<br>signs um and the different styles and<br>you can use the<br>Styles she argues and other people have<br>argued to work out the Naya<br>affiliations of the people who<br>have buried the SEMA and put the markers<br>on top um so you know like they're<br>important not you know they're important<br>for Buddhist history they're important<br>for viest practice monastic<br>discipline um yeah so and um there's<br>there's other stuff written but this<br>book is is really a marvelous source and<br>we have it in the<br>library um and it's also online as an<br>ebook so yeah<br>uh not not through our library how did<br>they get a c I must aent I got yeah<br>there's one our Russian friends have<br>I'm sure I got one from the library I<br>had to interload it though we should<br>have it the EB the ebook it's on J store<br>it's on J but we don't have access to it<br>through the library for some reason okay<br>we should have access maybe I should ask<br>them because um it's very useful um and<br>I was think of it like game of chess you<br>know how like you have to work your way<br>across the chessboard and then you can<br>turn into a king or a<br>queen you know what I mean pawns I don't<br>know because it's like it's it's very<br>much a grid pattern and you know you do<br>certain things on just maybe weird<br>but yeah so it's like if you work your<br>way to the right SEMA you can set up<br>here on Naya<br>and you know take over the monastery and<br>LEL and throw the other guys<br>out yeah years ago cambodians told me<br>that SEMA ceremon was the most important<br>cere<br>that uh I you that might be arguable but<br>it definitely is brings together a lot<br>of things in in ways that have a great<br>deal of social but it's the most<br>important because you can't do any other<br>sakama without a SEMA basically or if<br>you do it wrongly it's invalid it's<br>everything's everything's about the<br>ordinations are invalid the<br>whatever the the penalties and<br>rehabilitations are everything's<br>confession is useless unless it's done<br>properly and so your research with a<br>group that does not do SE is did you ask<br>him yeah like uh because of like<br>yesterday's talk I asked one monk from<br>umandawa he said we don't have a SEMA<br>but we have like this uh Gathering<br>ground because they don't have<br>ordination per se some of most of them<br>have not ordained and Gathering the<br>ground is like Mal pal cold<br>pal Winter Palace Winter Palace Winter<br>Palace yeah but then that means they<br>can't get the pension monastic pension<br>that means you know I oh no from the<br>they're not registered ID<br>cards but they wear robes yeah they wear<br>robes so they could get so they actually<br>could get arrested they could get<br>arrested for wearing robes because they<br>haven't been it's Absol like once you<br>start worrying about this you know how<br>many monks are there in um it's only 16<br>monks right it's interesting that no<br>one's tried to because in the Buddhist<br>temporalities ordinance they can be<br>arrested because like the uh I think<br>samant badra is ordained he is ordained<br>yeah yeah but not the others yeah but<br>and he has lot of like powerful<br>connections with the state so<br>yeah and then just do you need to get up<br>and take a break well the idea was we<br>were going to take a break but sorry and<br>you're the one saying we should be sure<br>to have breaks but um now you're<br>transgressing I'm listen I'm screwed all<br>time so on Thursday we're talking about<br>reestablishing the monastic you're<br>talking about it right in 1979 in<br>Cambodia so is this a valid<br>ordination well I would probably I would<br>argue that it did take place at WAM and<br>the question if<br>wam did not lose its where well anyway<br>we can talk about this later because um<br>but what I was told and is at the end of<br>this is that the SEMA ceremony was<br>performed three times once publicly and<br>twice<br>secretly and you would hope that at<br>least one of those was had some validity<br>uh but as an anthropologist I feel like<br>in the end that if society and the<br>recognize it uh then it's it's real uh<br>uh and ultimately there'll be people who<br>argue about it but in the<br>end in the end if if it's<br>sufficiently if it has once it has State<br>and social recognition<br>then it's like coordination theun if<br>enough people believe in it yeah then<br>you can have bik<br>again yeah okay but let's take it let's<br>take I'm going I'm going take break okay<br>sorry so Li you you're recording these<br>what are you these are just you're<br>holding on to these or you not last<br>night okay Dean says he he knows how to<br>best yeah because we have a we have a<br>this is what we do with Trent we have a<br>YouTube site for the uni so you can send<br>them there and I to I don't know what to<br>do with them he said<br>give give them to me so I'll do it so is<br>so you get somebody to do it he<br>said he'll oh there's no there's you<br>just send them to the oh no he knows who<br>to send it he knows the magic here we go<br>like Trent's already online we have a<br>yeah no he told me how to find out yeah<br>you reassured me going what are we GNA<br>do some people get in quick<br>payments<br>so 293 people have viewed Trent<br>talk yeah and he was really good about<br>linking on Facebook so we'll have to do<br>that I mean we need to get sharper with<br>quiet<br>just brought these along that's just a<br>couple of other books by that John<br>edited just show and tell you guys can<br>go I will have to duck off a little bit<br>well is Angela online she was oh she's I<br>I know she's also at work<br>okay that there she is she's online yeah<br>no I'm online yeah cool yeah say hi Hi<br>idea is your camera<br>on<br>no you might have to go to the other<br>it's all right is it okay it's all right<br>hi because you know you look like you're<br>in a staff<br>room I'm in a like meeting room yeah<br>yeah<br>yeah it's definitely not your home<br>Lounge no no it's not that not<br>comfortable at all but<br>yeah well done to make it here yeah yeah<br>no<br>good so wish she could see these<br>books<br>so some some of the temples at anore<br>have<br>Sima yeah but most of them don't seem<br>to raes lots of questions like you know<br>the<br>terada<br>um so pray I think has SEMA like<br>Tibetans<br>Drive daggers into the soil in the<br>cardinal directions so IUS NEP do um<br>Chinese have ordination Pavilion so it's<br>like each Naya has its own ordination<br>and you know<br>consecration system so it's not<br>Universal um it's you know like even<br>though<br>and that's what that tie book explains<br>very clearly that you know like in the<br>vinia it says a tree can be a semi<br>marker a river can be a semi marker so<br>like this anxiety about Stone bowls and<br>and carved Leaf markers is obviously<br>cultural<br>way<br>yeah when you're translating something<br>from kma to English and then they're<br>asking you to like translate it into<br>like from the P to English yeah then how<br>can you capture that moment exactly I<br>don't know it's very it's really hard<br>Pro that's what he was doing for his his<br>PhD thesis he was translating well they<br>what Trent Walker calls it a by text so<br>it's like sort of a mixture poly and the<br>vernacular whatever the vernacular is<br>and it's like it just increases the<br>amount of languages you need to know<br>yeah you have to know both language at<br>least if you if you are dealing with the<br>bilingual text especially the classical<br>one which is Bali or Sanskrit and then<br>is a vacular<br>translation sometimes the<br>translator elaborate on the meaning<br>sometime it not explicit meaning there<br>it on which we call that um commentator<br>okay a commentarial portion but if the<br>P portion was translate explicitly so we<br>would say this is The<br>annotation so as a<br>philological text so so there's a<br>different kind of biex so which can be a<br>um a commentarial exes or it can be a<br>philological portion so that's it yeah<br>but at the same time like if you're<br>translating it from K to English you can<br>you can understand that social context<br>because why they<br>were like not translating everything but<br>translating some parts of it right or<br>like changing it couple of generations<br>the language changes anywhere yeah the<br>translator we are dealing with the<br>complexity yeah of the translation of<br>the<br>translation like John's dealing with<br>like the translation of the C into<br>English in 19 in the 1930s which is the<br>command that command translation also<br>the translation of the<br>B yeah then sometimes it's not explicit<br>translation I mean like the K<br>translation of the might not be the<br>explicit translation of yeah that's<br>right I I was interested in that why is<br>that is a challenging that we are<br>experienced layer upon layer yeah I I<br>have I have like read some parts of this<br>new moments book because it's relevant<br>to my work I<br>guess that's very old yeah still I was<br>yesterday translation is<br>important translation is a very very<br>important his<br>own uh difficulties and you know it's<br>yeah it's not as straightforward as we<br>maybe once thought in our<br>night yeah what I what I love is using<br>I've been using Google translate a lot<br>because I work a lot<br>on stuff I find on Vietnamese Buddhism<br>online and I know it's wrong but I can<br>see like in 20 years like that will<br>become the dominant form of<br>translation and you know here yeah<br>because because one of the monks I'm<br>studying he's he has translated like<br>Tria to simple s color not like was<br>already there but he has not translated<br>Abid section but he is telling that Abid<br>is not for people it's for God so that's<br>what a good strategy yeah so and we do<br>it really interesting yeah it's really<br>interesting it's so pretty I can't<br>understand it's very pretty and there<br>are why do I think it's of com script um<br>you mean the Manu from the manuscript<br>point of view yeah from the manuscript<br>point of view and script<br>use<br>so<br>well<br>well I'm basically going to read the<br>introduction to my translated chapter as<br>I said that I had collaborators on this<br>um uh Chun who on the translation and<br>alizabeth contributed to to the<br>introduction as well um and so this will<br>be my reading and yet I hope I can make<br>comments that will help sort of um make<br>make this a bit more interesting um<br>analysis of seus in summary was first<br>published in plumin in 1932 it's a<br>chimar language booklet summarizing the<br>contents of major poly text and<br>commentaries about the use of semas the<br>book is regularly mentioned in scholarly<br>work on Cambodian SEMA traditions and<br>Chito writing in French in the book you<br>were<br>circulating<br>um uh<br>um provides a detailed recapitulation of<br>its contents the author of the book sdat<br>whoat who we see in this picture<br>um would eventually become the mahiki<br>patriarch is one of the key Cambodian<br>monastic figures of the 20th<br>century um above and beyond what the<br>text offers us is a summary of canonical<br>writings an example of a well-known text<br>by hot the text has been interpreted by<br>Scholars is connected to changing<br>attitudes toward Buddhist text and<br>practice in the reform schools<br>associated with huad perhaps the best<br>way of putting the text into context and<br>thus the shorter version of it<br>translated in the second part of this<br>chapter is by talking about who taught<br>in his connection to the reform movement<br>who taught born in kpu Province near<br>udong was ordained in 1912 at wat unal<br>and plumen the temple administratively<br>at the head of the Mahan order here he<br>met the older sdat junat with whom he is<br>closely associated and junat as I said<br>is in this picture to it very left<br>um um junat even more than Hut has come<br>to take on the character of a Cambodian<br>National icon symbolizing its sa and<br>Cambodian Buddhism more generally as<br>young monks in early 20th century<br>colonial Cambodia they pursued their<br>studies assiduously taking advantage of<br>new opportunities for study and fully<br>exploring the intellectual movements<br>within Buddhism of their time their<br>projects of study were often shared such<br>as when early on they studied Sanskrit<br>from an Indian Peanut Vendor in 1922<br>they would go together to pursue studies<br>in Hanoi at the<br>E Aran under the supervision of French<br>schar<br>louo wart wrote about his friendship<br>with the older and a key<br>work that is to say my kalana mat kalana<br>mat being a Buddhist term for friendship<br>built on the principles of<br>Buddhism Penny Edwards translates the<br>book title neatly as my<br>soulmate they're considered<br>representatives of the reform movement<br>in Cambodian Buddhism which Drew on the<br>ideas and momentum of early earlier<br>modernization movements in sayam with<br>some of the same principles that in say<br>would result in the creation of the<br>dut order although the dut name to<br>kodi's Well Chad who taught worked<br>within the larger more popularly based<br>mahiki order part of a movement that<br>would sometime be called a new<br>Mahan it promoted a Buddhism that was<br>clearly based on poly scriptures and<br>called for eliminating practices with a<br>less clear scriptural Foundation seen as<br>extraneous or<br>superstitious in this context They<br>promoted a Buddhism that involved<br>translation and understanding nepalian<br>Sanskrit rather than the wrote recit of<br>Buddhist formulas the movement was<br>likewise associated with the publication<br>of books often in the national language<br>instead of Reliance on PA manuscripts<br>and on systems of Education based on<br>classroom instruction as much as on a<br>personal relationship to a teacher while<br>the controversy played itself Out Among<br>the monastic Elites like chunat and huat<br>the controversies frequently extended<br>individual Buddhist<br>temples where there were vehement<br>disputes over points of ritual the<br>pronunciation of poly chant and the<br>proper use of monastic<br>robes initially opposed by the monastic<br>hierarchy the movement after gaining the<br>support of king cisat became firmly<br>established as the dominant stance of<br>monastic Authority by the mid<br>1920s nevertheless the tensions between<br>the reformed samay movement and more<br>traditional Boran would remain a<br>significant division within the<br>Cambodian monod up until the ppat period<br>and remains part of the discourse of<br>Cambodian Buddhism at the present time<br>one should note that while the<br>importance of figures like junad and who<br>taught is widely acknowledged and praise<br>there's also scholarly tradition<br>identified especially by the work of<br>franois bizo that valorizes the complex<br>ritual world of non-reformed ban<br>practices that were marginalized or lost<br>as the reform movement is some greater<br>importance utat and junat career<br>coincided with the establishment and<br>development of new Buddhist institutions<br>in Cambodia as Hansen and Edward shows<br>us The Fringe policy of building up of<br>Buddhist institutions was motivated in<br>part by the desire to curb a tendency<br>within Cambodian laian Buddhism see<br>Bangkok as the center of monastic<br>culture and education by building up<br>comparable institutions within French<br>Indochina after a brief attempt at<br>creating a poly school at Anor in 1909<br>the the called<br>deali later called Superior deali<br>created in pumpin in 1914 would Pro Prov<br>Pro more durable in the careers of huat<br>and chunat develop in connection with<br>this institution where they both taught<br>soon after its Creation in 1924 after<br>returning from Hanoi Kat was appointed<br>professor of Sanskrit at the school<br>later in 1930 CH not would be the<br>director the National Library was<br>created in 192 won and was involved<br>early on in the publication of Buddhist<br>texts including books by chadan who<br>taught in the longer version of the<br>booklet translated here a tpiat<br>commission was founded in<br>1929 headed by Lou IM at that time the<br>director of the superior deali devoted<br>to creating a complete bilingual edition<br>of the scriptures in p and K who taught<br>and do not were connected with this<br>project over the many years of its<br>existence they would also be be closely<br>associated with the Buddhist Institute<br>founded in 1930 by French scholar suzan<br>capelles of EOL Fran dixam Orient whom<br>they had come to know there during their<br>time in Hanoi above and beyond its<br>importance for Cambodian Buddhism the<br>Buddhist Institute is often described as<br>a seminal institution in the development<br>of Cambodian<br>nationalism in part because of its<br>connection with a nationalist<br>intellectual<br>sonan an early staff member bes its role<br>in promoting the work of the TR<br>commission the Buddhist Institute<br>was was an outgrowth of the revitalized<br>Buddhist education institutions put in<br>place in the previous decades its<br>mission was to respond to the needs of<br>the poly schools libraries museums and<br>other programs that had established to<br>promote and study terada<br>Buddhism the book translated here<br>appeared in<br>1932 that is at a time when at least<br>some of the major battles of a formed<br>Buddhism had already been won but<br>relatively early in Hong career 11 years<br>after the creation of the National<br>Library which published it in only two<br>years after the creation of the Buddhist<br>Institute it reflected the goals of the<br>institutions bat was affiliated with and<br>is often interpreted suggesting his<br>approach to Buddhist<br>practice junat would become the<br>patriarch of the Mahan order in<br>1948 a position that gave him great<br>prominence at the time of Cambodian<br>Independence and through the period when<br>nordom cuk was in power who taught who<br>is the head of the Buddhist education<br>during that period was regarded as the<br>second ranking monk in the Mahan order<br>he became a supreme patriarch after Jun<br>not's death in<br>1969 and would have that position<br>through the turbulent period in which<br>cook was deposed and the country fell<br>into<br>war um from from the beginning of his<br>career who let's<br>just uh Hut was closely associated with<br>the text of the Buddhist scriptures most<br>focused on monastic discipline and<br>procedure the<br>vah Hansen points out in Hut's terms the<br>vah with its commentary was like a seed<br>and having once begun to read it it took<br>root in our hearts and minds and began<br>to grow after a series of sermons on the<br>van in 1912 generated controversy a<br>group of monks the Gan study groups<br>focused on the Vana among them<br>huat early in his career in 1918 huat<br>wrote a book on the monastic regulations<br>for<br>novices samera Vaya because he<br>anticipated controversy as Jun and<br>another reformist Monk umu to add their<br>names as co-authors of the book it was<br>published with the interven of French<br>authorities despite opposition by<br>monastic authorities loyal to the ban<br>traditions a major turning point in the<br>history of the reform movement the<br>question of the SEMA is also very much a<br>concern of inia and the booklet<br>translated here is very much in the<br>tradition and the Vana studies<br>associated with<br>Hut the booklet makes explicit reference<br>to the fact that it draws on the mahaga<br>one of the books of the Vana it also<br>draws on commentaries the<br>mahaga atak and the parivara atak it is<br>very much keeping with everything we<br>know about who taught and do not and<br>what they represented that this booklet<br>aims to present a version of SEMA<br>practice as found in the poly<br>Scriptures it begins with a description<br>of the sermon by the Buddha on vulture's<br>Peak that is the primary scriptural<br>source for the concept of SEMA the rest<br>of the booklet drawing on the<br>commentaries outlines ways of<br>categorizing SEMA and the proper<br>practices as they relay to different<br>categories the text primarily involves<br>the explication of different poly terms<br>categorization uh we don't know how the<br>booklet was originally used<br>um<br>um the booklet does not really tell us<br>anything about the actual Comm practice<br>at the time it was written it also does<br>not um in any way explicitly prescribed<br>contemporary Cambodian usage its<br>publication is an indication<br>nevertheless of the fact that Hut and<br>his group are concerned with this issue<br>of semas at this time and the tendency<br>of Scholars to assume that it figured in<br>attempts to promote reform and SEMA<br>practice probably will take in perhaps<br>the most Salient point to make about the<br>booklet is that it exclusively concerns<br>monastic practice there's nothing to<br>indicate that the elaborate lay<br>practices associated with SEMA<br>ceremonies are necessary or<br>desirable Cho is much concerned with the<br>fact that the book that makes no<br>reference to the traditional practice of<br>Devotion to De Celestial deities as at<br>the different Cardinal and subcardinal<br>directions marked by the<br>semas<br>um and I<br>S was written previously but although it<br>recalls passages from V and atata<br>relating the origin the limitation of<br>Sema although it quotes and Buddhist<br>texts pronounced on the occasion of the<br>ceremony it does not explain any ritual<br>to us and completely ignores the deat<br>cult she to whose field r on semas dates<br>to the 1960s 30 years after the<br>publication of this booklet makes it<br>clear that there were both traditional<br>and reformed SEMA practices in Cambodia<br>and there was some tendency to eliminate<br>what was considered non- Buddhist<br>practices I quote Jito again the ritual<br>activities that take place during a SEMA<br>ceremony can be said reflect a double<br>religious Focus some activities are<br>Buddhist they consist in reciting texts<br>in remembering the ways the Buddha<br>enabled the delimitation of Aima in the<br>monasteries and commemorating certain<br>episodes in the life of the Buddha and<br>the jataka the consecration of new<br>images of the blessed one and finally in<br>making offerings to the Buddha or the<br>monks the other ritual activities are<br>addressed to the divinities of the<br>cardinal direction points and of the<br>earth they consist of prayers and<br>offerings especially food offerings the<br>worship of these deities the deat can be<br>of variable importance it can even some<br>sometimes be suppressed whereas Buddhist<br>ritual activities are essential and can<br>possibly be celebrated by themselves<br>alone Jato said that while there was no<br>policy to impose a set practice for SEMA<br>consecration ceremonies what Lum the<br>central administrative Monastery of the<br>Mahan Kai order and the home watt of<br>huat and junat was a model for reformed<br>practices that is to say the Temple of<br>Hut and<br>junat um strictly Buddhist in character<br>newly developing regions of the country<br>tended to follow the reform practices<br>whereas older more established regions<br>tended to maintain non-reform practices<br>different scholars in addressing the<br>question of how reformist Tendencies<br>affected border<br>ceremonies have emphasized different<br>issues as mentioned above Jito observes<br>how traditional practices addressing tat<br>deities of space and time especially as<br>they represented the cardinal directions<br>would being lost in SEMA practice<br>ceremony practice and related to it<br>ceremonies addressed to the indefinite<br>spiritual presence as h with the Earth<br>and known as K Bai Elizabeth gri has<br>described the<br>decline in frequency performance of the<br>maraya in conjunction with consecration<br>ceremonies including SEMA ceremonies<br>although some of the restrictions he<br>documents date before the publication of<br>H's book PL Ashley Thompson describes<br>the use of the leaflike ritual object<br>called the babil and establishing sacred<br>boundaries and various rituals<br>including that of establishing SEMA<br>although she's not concerned with any<br>decline in its<br>usage it likewise may also be described<br>as part of a conjunction of Boran<br>practices that would have become less<br>frequent in reform oriented<br>temples at the heart of this discussion<br>the most relevant to the text translated<br>here or at least scholarly discussion of<br>it is the significance of one SEMA<br>placed at the center of the vihara<br>rather than as all the others are<br>bordering the space around it this is<br>called the<br>sakila or<br>Sak or in Western literature on<br>Cambodian bu and the IND<br>theil um<br>so back<br>to these pictures uh notice that in this<br>in the second picture to the left<br>there's a SEMA that is right in front of<br>the Buddha image um and the the thing<br>that makes this controversial is that in<br>the original poly text there's no<br>mention of there being a SEMA at this in<br>this location<br>um discussion of the sea and its<br>relation to the other SEMA is prominent<br>in the literature on Cambodian SEMA<br>practice such as work by por maspero<br>that describes the SEMA as representing<br>the parts of the body with a s s as as<br>the<br>naval uh she writes the roots of a SEMA<br>represent the various parts of a human<br>body the one in the center being the<br>naval The Village land where a house is<br>to be built has a naval the central SEMA<br>called SEMA in theill is the most sacred<br>the naval of a private land is<br>endowed with qualities such that one<br>should not build on<br>it Ashley Thompson similarly gives great<br>symbolic weight to the central<br>sea uh a key question as is whether as<br>some Scholars have suggested the sakal<br>was among the practices that reformists<br>like Hut orun try to do away with Ian<br>her states that Hut argued that there<br>was no poly basis for the use of the<br>seal although the evidence for this is<br>not completely clear um Harris writes<br>that who taught short work<br>uh the work translated here first<br>publish in 1932 fits in with this effort<br>remarkably well in Conformity with his<br>training under Lou Foo the work is an<br>attempt to strip away<br>non-canonical ibr manical and<br>superstitious cre from the S planting<br>ritual one of Tat's primary conclusions<br>is that the Inda kill is unknown in poly<br>sources which also have nothing to say<br>about the cult of divinities at least in<br>the context of ritual boundary<br>formation um nevertheless supporting<br>this with a reference uh to the longer<br>version of the book of translate here<br>raises problem since it does not as we<br>have said previously make any explicit<br>prescriptions for contemporary cambod in<br>usage and makes no reference positive or<br>negative of the<br>Sako this suggests one of three<br>possibilities that one that teris felt<br>that the fact that the SEO was not<br>mentioned was sufficient to indicate<br>that who taught opposed it or two a<br>separate text exists not referenced by<br>Harris on which Hutt is explicit in<br>opposing the practice of the SE or that<br>three that Harris knew of Hutt's<br>opposition to seal usage from other<br>sources such as interviews but<br>introduced it here as in a way that is<br>slightly<br>misleading um perhaps we can say at<br>least that we have some Clues suggesting<br>that Hut may have opposed the use of the<br>S and this is in a broad sense<br>consistent with what we know about Hut<br>tat in junat reform his position but the<br>thing I would emphasize is that the<br>actually does not does not in any way uh<br>argue against the use of the of the SEMA<br>Co the central SEMA uh this brings us to<br>and and this is I think the most<br>interesting thing I found uh the more<br>complex and contradictory case of the<br>ceremony<br>uh<br>um uh wat un is for administrative<br>purposes the central wat of the cambod<br>Mahan order whatam Viara currently<br>displays the DAT<br>2500 Buddhist era on the outside of the<br>building which perhaps the first the<br>ground baking for the new theara and<br>suggest that its construction was<br>conceived in conjunction with the<br>2500 Buddha gianti celebrations that is<br>celebrated in the western calendar of<br>the of 1957<br>CE this was a major event in the newly<br>independent country sometimes even seen<br>as having Millennial<br>overtones the actual SEMA ceremony took<br>place on upon the completion of the<br>building in 1963 some 30 years after the<br>publication of the booklet translated<br>here at a time when junad and Hut were<br>securely ins sconed in the numbers one<br>and two positions in the mahai<br>order Cho in describing the<br>concentration<br>wadam emphasized its<br>austerity and and does state that the<br>a um I quote at where the pr has two<br>floors 11 SEMA markets have been placed<br>two in the east south and north one in<br>the west and one at each of the<br>intercardinal points it was only one<br>marker buried in the center of the floor<br>ground floor Shrine to be the Indila<br>nimita<br>at first glance it seems consistent with<br>an article about the ceremony in the<br>journal koria that includes a picture of<br>Prince nordom head of state ceremonially<br>cutting the rope that will allow the<br>sakal stone to fall into place a sword<br>is held in place ready to be<br>struck um by Ry lamot the president of<br>the Cambodian branch of the world<br>Fellowship of<br>Buddhists this would undercut Harris's<br>argument that who taught opposed to s<br>h however on Consulting monks from what<br>UNAM about this a much more complicated<br>scenario<br>emerges according<br>to when I wrote this he was venerable<br>yon sang now he has a title of s and<br>venerable vanet both professors and<br>assistant Deans at the Buddhist<br>University he's uh venerable um yaned is<br>now the vice<br>Rector um it is known through oral<br>tradition that the SEMA ceremony ended<br>up being performed three times because<br>of the patriarch Jun not's frustration<br>with what he regarded as irregularities<br>and the proceedings and his desire to<br>form a ceremony in keeping with the poly<br>scriptures which has uh a great deal of<br>implications for the importance of the<br>text be translated the capaia article<br>now first the first ceremony a very much<br>public event that took place over four<br>days from June 1st to 4th 1963 and<br>besides COK the head of state involved<br>several prominent lay<br>figures 100 monks took<br>part the first day this was expanded to<br>10,000 monks for the third and fourth<br>Day activities the article describes a<br>ceremony the first day outside the vhar<br>honoring<br>theat who protect the temple points out<br>that in contrast to some temples there<br>was no offering made to kpali again<br>these<br>are what were considered Boran<br>Traditions what we know about the two<br>subsequent ceremonies is limited<br>according to Venable Yan wrote us<br>unfortunately sakama was not agreed on<br>by the monk congregations who affirmed<br>that the S Kama was wrongly performed<br>sdun approved having the<br>Sama that is the SEMA ceremony done<br>again without the participation of lay<br>people again in the text we looked at<br>there's no reference to any<br>participation of lay persons only monks<br>were allowed to attend the second tribe<br>failed again based on the same reason<br>some that you not agreed to have the S<br>perform for a third<br>time under the leadership of the most<br>venerable Moon it is rumored that samat<br>chunat was very frustrated with the<br>performance of the SEMA K the SEMA<br>ceremony and he would not allow a fourth<br>time to happen the third performance was<br>very secretly performed by the<br>s for the third<br>performance there was only one lay<br>person who attended the ceremony the<br>rest were monks<br>H again we know so little about this but<br>it's intriguing for what it suggests<br>about the<br>situation it is unlikely that anyone who<br>participated in these ceremonies is<br>still living this accounts leaves many<br>questions to most of which we are<br>unlikely to get answers what precisely<br>was considered acceptable and not<br>acceptable in the ceremonies to what<br>extent were the practices described in<br>the translated booklet those that were<br>used as the standards in the second and<br>third ceremonies were the previous semas<br>ritually removed before the successive<br>ceremony were performed where the stones<br>left in place or were they removed and<br>replaced every time what monks<br>participated in the success of<br>Ceremonies who was the one lay person<br>who attended the last ceremony and what<br>was his role was the second ceremony<br>secret as well as the third why was<br>secrecy considered necessary who is and<br>was not privy to knowledge about the<br>success of ceremonies the story does<br>affirm is that details in the practice<br>of Semus were taken seriously by junat<br>and the circles of monks around him<br>including of course who Tau there was a<br>conscious effort to make the ceremony<br>consistent with poly scriptures and this<br>included reducing the numbers of lay<br>person and attendance this is consistent<br>with importance usually attributed the<br>text uh translated here none of this<br>tells us for example anything about<br>whether the<br>S figured in the second and third<br>ceremony as Sam and venerable van<br>pointed out a decorative tile appears to<br>Mark the side of the<br>S on the ground floor of the varara<br>although to add another slight twist to<br>the puzzle is not situated directly in<br>front of the central Buddha image as is<br>customary but at the very center of the<br>vihara there seems to be no oral<br>tradition suggesting that the second and<br>third ceremonies did not involve<br>AAL prior to contacting inable y inable<br>vanet we communicated with a former monk<br>who while still young had been secretary<br>to S Jun not near the end of his life<br>and continued as secretary to some<br>thatat after he become patriarch he<br>seemed surprised that we would even call<br>into the question the idea that there<br>was a there was a seal he assumed that<br>there would be a seal one should note<br>that while the Somaya practices<br>associated with chunat and Hut are often<br>well entrenched in Cambodia<br>today with ban practices adhered to in<br>what seems to be a decreasing number of<br>temples the use of the<br>sakal does seem to be Universal in<br>contemporary practice um speculation on<br>the political implication of the story<br>runs the risk of lending itself to<br>narrative's biased for against COK or<br>other political figures it goes without<br>saying however that that restricting the<br>lay Presence at the ceremonies meant<br>excluding COK and other political Royal<br>figures from the event if the success of<br>Ceremonies were primarily motivated by<br>the desire to adhere to poly scriptures<br>this also meant removing them from the<br>taint of secular power it would probably<br>be an over interpretation to suggest<br>that this was a significant motivation<br>but may have been one of the reasons for<br>keeping the ceremony<br>secret and<br>um well um I think I will uh I have a<br>little bit more here about the end of<br>huot's life and he um he he was<br>patriarch at the time that codia fell to<br>the karou<br>and and seemed to been assassinated in<br>the early days of the karou period so um<br>uh so just some comments putting this<br>into the context of of my work and as I<br>say I'm not a specialist on<br>on semas and yet this does in some sense<br>relate to some of the things I talked<br>about yesterday and um we see a<br>moment of of Buddhist transition which<br>is also social transition um<br>now now this moment that this was<br>happening was also the time that um that<br>dharm ATA<br>was was a figure<br>and what we found in the case of davara<br>was that he came to Cambodia in the<br>50s um at a moment<br>when the role of the Mahan Kai sect was<br>not so clear and generally the idea that<br>figures like Jun not or whoau were at<br>all politically controversial is not<br>mentioned at all but if we look at minor<br>text commentaries by American diplomats<br>we know that um figures like junad and<br>who taught actually um were in the 50s<br>perhaps not so well connected to the<br>king to the royal family and um they had<br>there was an association with uh some of<br>the people who' who' uh were calling for<br>a republic like sonan um this dated to<br>the time of of the early years of the of<br>the Buddhist Institute um in which suzan<br>capellas was<br>so the fact<br>that one interpretation of all of this<br>is<br>that junad and Hut actually did not<br>welcome the presence of the king in<br>these ceremonies that's only one<br>possible interpretation this was in the<br>' 50s there seemed to been moment where<br>where perhaps dharmar was a rival to<br>chunat and utad and there was this one<br>reason dharmar<br>was was asked to stop coming to Cambodia<br>was this feeling that he perhaps<br>represent he was close to see and<br>perhaps represented a threat to them and<br>here we<br>see perhaps a continuing evidence that<br>their relationship to the monarchy was<br>was was one of questioning it one of<br>questioning whether the king should play<br>a role in the stablishment of this very<br>important SEMA<br>ceremony um at this the most important<br>temple in the mahika order this is only<br>one possible interpretation in the years<br>that follow um the evidence seemed to be<br>that Hut and junat did maintain very<br>good relationship with with with COK and<br>the royal family although when COK was<br>overthrown in a coup in 1970 H was<br>fairly quick to<br>recognize uh those who overthrew sio and<br>aou um so these are Hai issues in<br>Cambodia and so we're looking at semas<br>we're looking at something that seems<br>very uh very monastic something that is<br>of concern to monks more than lay people<br>but what interests me is that in the end<br>these begin to<br>have perhaps political overtones as well<br>and and are something that we might<br>consider as we look at uh the<br>relationship between Buddhism and<br>politics and and the social and<br>political transitions that were taking<br>place at that time so<br>okay that's my talk for today and but<br>let's I'd be very interested in comments<br>and I wonder who's on video and uh<br>comments I've got I've got some<br>questions so um I I was um interested in<br>the interpretation of putting<br>the SEMA in the center of the vihara you<br>heard of the in sorry inin the C City<br>pole pillar yeah yeah yeah um so<br>because the term<br>Center When you mention about the pillar<br>the the the pillar of um city<br>or yeah um it's means heart it is mean<br>the nille it also mean the center yeah<br>so I'm just I'm just C can you give me<br>like so you mention the name of a person<br>who a schola who gave that<br>interpretation that um putting the the<br>the the SEMA in the center of the vihara<br>is mean is representing the bodily part<br>um can you keep give me like the name of<br>that scholar um uh I I could have cash<br>was it Ian Harris it was not Ian Harris<br>it's a French colar and<br>um I think it was someone other than<br>meline shito I'll have to give that to<br>yes yes because because um the thing I<br>mean<br>the uh well there's two things one is<br>that<br>in but this seems to be Universal<br>practice in Cambodia and no one seems to<br>be questioning it despite the the fact<br>the scholars questioned it I don't know<br>whether that it is whether in Thailand<br>it's any different um but in<br>and uh um and no one in cambod use the<br>terms<br>IND um but that seems to be the term<br>that's been used by by Scholars writing<br>about this again perhaps that's a term<br>used in Thailand um but uh<br>this is one scholar a French scholar um<br>suggesting that that there was a<br>metaphorical relationship an implicit<br>metaphor to to the body with this being<br>the naval yes that what I'm interested I<br>I find that very interesting very<br>suggestive um it sounds like<br>um<br>like like something the French would say<br>and uh like no no no it's more than that<br>it's it's like for example they call<br>that in<br>Bali in<br>Indonesia indin it seems to be like<br>anywhere in h well what does IND inder<br>imply Indra yes but does Indra suggest<br>the<br>naval no where do we get the naval idea<br>I mean is that is that in scriptures K<br>Kila is the um the the the<br>vadra that is thrust into the Earth okay<br>but the question is the idea that it's<br>it's not just a dagger it's not it's<br>actually a naval yes where does that<br>come from so that's the center of the<br>Earth or the mandala where the breaches<br>Enlightenment well the term in Tai we<br>use hat yeah means<br>heart<br>like haa it's a hard but when you<br>mention the term hatya of the city<br>people of course the Nar of the city<br>it's also it's also the nval it's but I<br>actually don't know where the idea or no<br>I mean I don't mean to be putting that<br>down um yeah but but yeah because I<br>don't know this literature I'm just<br>being annoing um I can't tell you to<br>what extent this literature is found in<br>poly or apparently it's found in Thai<br>but um and to what it's in it's a<br>projection of people who are trying to<br>Western schols who trying to<br>conceptualize yeah yeah that would be<br>good friends if I can have a look and<br>then like because one of my<br>interpretation of the center or the<br>heart or the NV so it's just one the<br>reference yeah so I I know<br>like um anthropological analysis but I<br>actually don't know that the scholar<br>work no and and I and and these things<br>do appeal to me actually and I mean I<br>even though I don't know what Mel Ela<br>eliada is you know I think it's very<br>controversial figure this is the kind<br>of kind of scholarly work on religion<br>which tries to find Universal things<br>that would find a a metaphorical<br>relationship implicit or explicit in in<br>these kinds of relationships and I I<br>actually I do well welcome that kind of<br>interpretation um but<br>um<br>although we also need to be very careful<br>even in in Mandela studies I mean that<br>there are times when the term Mandela is<br>explicitly used yes and that we clearly<br>have we can say in this context this<br>Society actually used the term Mandela<br>um in this context and then but Scholars<br>have tended to extend that more<br>generally in ways that are very<br>interesting but but we need to be very<br>careful about so um do do do do people<br>actually use the term or do the people<br>like do the people who involved with the<br>ceremony interpret the that's kind of<br>well well I said that um cambodians<br>actually all these Scholars are talking<br>about IND and that's the cambodians I<br>ask have never heard of that term Indico<br>but if you but if you look at po what if<br>you look at<br>I mean you've got to look at that PO<br>muso and and theau because I think some<br>of these things were older well and<br>they're just I know popular I I'm not<br>saying that it was never used but okay<br>but um<br>uh the cambodians I talked to knew the<br>term seal and they did not know the term<br>indal and so and I asked a lot of<br>cambodians and no one had ever heard of<br>the in the Cod and so if it was once<br>used well the question is who used it<br>and in what context but but all I can<br>say is that that usage when I talk to<br>cambodians have I just don't see it yeah<br>in the mo in the modern period it's not<br>used well yeah and when does the modern<br>period probably when CH when H TOS thing<br>took off no no okay but so okay okay<br>okay so it's kind of cool so turv you<br>know bar<br>turval right so he writes about this his<br>thesis is that this is related to texts<br>formulated in eastern India between the<br>9th and 12th century that were exported<br>from there to the<br>mons okay and that his Wilder thesis is<br>that the idea originally came from China<br>the idea that there's a rotating Naga<br>under the<br>Earth and you have to pin it down so you<br>just get this<br>okay so like the in theill or the seill<br>is right in front of the Buddha<br>image because that's the naval of the<br>Earth where the Buddha meditated and<br>reached<br>Enlightenment okay I mean so this is the<br>theory so that's why it's positioned<br>there Theory and but the other thing is<br>when you said the center yeah yeah is<br>that in<br>what it you know like in this picture<br>here it's not in the Center of theara<br>it's in the center of the Eartha I think<br>the but in the case of un it actually is<br>in the center it's not right in front of<br>the Buddha image it's further to the<br>center and that you know may not mean<br>anything maybe yeah and yet it's an<br>interesting variant and does it does it<br>mean anything and was it it disconscious<br>decision by jat I you know we don't know<br>just Indra is like the right is it yeah<br>so each each Cardinal Point has a Dy<br>associated with it<br>right Indra is Earth isn't it is it I<br>don't know I'm just asking sometimesy is<br>God yeah go to earth right but he's sky<br>but the lightning bolt hits the Earth so<br>each Cardinal Point is associated with a<br>different deity and I can't remember<br>them all well again and then pointing<br>over and this was this was associated<br>with different David in the Boran<br>tradition and this was what what was<br>being definitely this was being<br>questioned this is what it's not in the<br>veneer yeah it's definitely not in the<br>vinea and okay and Jito specifically<br>documents the fact that this was this<br>was a controversy and apparently in the<br>first the first SEMA ceremony with wam<br>they did use devatas uh and then this<br>this was something that was apparently<br>not used in the second and third SEMA<br>know so putting the SEMA in the center<br>of the vihara representing the ban<br>practice so it's not now it was it's not<br>samai<br>it's that was but no<br>on the the scholars are saying it's not<br>semi and Ian Harris actually said that<br>what UNAM did not<br>have have an inder kill an Indra kill<br>but he's wrong but he's wrong they did<br>have it<br>and<br>nowadays in Cambodia Cambodia is mostly<br>samay it's it's a non-reformed it's the<br>reformed tradition and in the reformed<br>tradition they have<br>the they have the same a<br>it it did not if anyone at any point<br>wanted to eliminate the seal it didn't<br>take and within what's considered the<br>the reformed tradition they use the seal<br>and seal is universally used in Cambodia<br>whether you're reformed or not reformed<br>at the present time is it in the T<br>Temple does b day have us same well that<br>that's another question which I can't<br>answer and so are is it anyone on video<br>able to answer that<br>question um but<br>um and that's I've never thought of so<br>what do you mean by<br>reform so so in in time so I'm I don't<br>know what I understand you yeah<br>correctly so what you mean by reform is<br>that refer to Thea or reform within the<br>mahay it gets complicated in Cambodia<br>because all this had to do with the<br>influence of the dakai in Thailand but<br>Cambodia become comp because there is a<br>dakai there is a dut in Cambodia but<br>there were also uh monks like junat<br>whoat were Mahan Kai and yet they<br>with and to the extent at least that<br>they uh uh there were continue to be<br>difference between the D and mahik even<br>in the reform movement okay pit is<br>raising his hand yes<br>yes but hello can can you hear me uh<br>yes okay thank you so much uh I I heard<br>that uh you you mentioned uh when you<br>talk to a Cambodian people you never<br>heard the the term uh that they never<br>heard the term SE no I heard SE I did<br>not here in IND IND both of them both of<br>them IND and S are the same term it it's<br>just a synonym and there is some uh<br>Anthropologist who wrote some article<br>about it if you want to can send it to<br>you perhaps it news article but there is<br>the a culture there is the most people<br>not most people but some people know<br>about it but perhaps that the the person<br>that you talk to they they have no idea<br>about s or Andre<br>but both of them are the same term that<br>they have the same meaning it mean that<br>they put the symbol of SE in the central<br>of the uh vihara but um uh on need to<br>understand that in uh in in in uh the<br>the main purpose of uh establishing the<br>SE boundary in vihara it is not<br>about power is based on the text based<br>on the V text So based on the monastic<br>code it is it is about just setting a<br>boundary or something like that but when<br>it comes to uh to to the uh Cambodian<br>Buddhism when it come to like mixing<br>with the local CES people tend to<br>believe that there is some sort of a<br>superstitious there some sort of a<br>spiritual power in that uh symbol of<br>boundary or SEMA but as a matter of fact<br>based on the test I think this is the<br>the the reason that uh chatut try to<br>translate the P text into K language in<br>order to enhance uh K Buddhist to<br>understand the meaning of of V so<br>meaning of monastic monastic code in in<br>in Buddhism uh but as I said uh uh anal<br>or SE or or another SEMA Stone it just a<br>symbol of you know setting a boundary<br>for a s member to perform the the former<br>act or or something like that and I hope<br>that you you you you you can understand<br>what I'm trying to say yes I mostly<br>agree with what you're saying and I<br>wasn't saying that uh the word when the<br>people I talk to uh the term they used<br>was seal and I asked people specifically<br>about the term Indra and at least the<br>people I talk to did not did not<br>recognize that term so so I I'm sure<br>you're right<br>that within some monastic tradition<br>there is the use of indal although when<br>actually they did not use the<br>term I'm I'm I'm sorry to interrupt but<br>in in in the monastic code in the vinea<br>code the term dn't the Buddha<br>did not specifically mention the term<br>the term perhaps just come up<br>later which is because in in in in the<br>VIN in the vinia book in The V vinia<br>text the Buddha just mentioned the<br>symbol of a SEMA some sort of stone or<br>something like that for a Sanka member<br>to set a boundary for them to perform<br>for example like<br>OPP uh in order to have a unity in the<br>Sanka member because some of them at<br>that time could not you know the the<br>they not they were not United and and<br>and so this is the reason of you know<br>the Buddha setting the role for the<br>Sanka member to establish the the the<br>SEMA or the SEMA boundary in in the<br>monastic uh community and this is from<br>uh this is what I can understand from a<br>monastic perspective but uh when it come<br>to uh<br>mixing with the local culture especially<br>in the case of Cambodia because Cambodia<br>was uh you<br>know following<br>uh uh brahmanism before Hinduism before<br>so uh the the the culture I think the<br>term perhaps come from Hinduism or<br>something like that anal or seel and it<br>used to to enhance the the way that the<br>people believe in in the<br>superstitious or spiritual pow something<br>like that but the original term of sea<br>it has nothing to do with that but the<br>the the the way that people believe is<br>very strong in the cas of Cambodia if if<br>any buddhis if any s member spoke up<br>again some sort of beliefs it kind of<br>the the they provoke some sort of anger<br>or something like that and local people<br>do not like that and that's why they<br>they tend to keep the you know you know<br>what people believe it doesn't matter<br>that much yeah yeah thank you I think<br>that's very<br>true yeah that that that's what I can<br>understand From perspective yeah but um<br>people would have a a different opinion<br>uh about that I I I I have no problem<br>with that<br>yeah you also have that word Indra in<br>singala yeah it's not Indra it's Indra<br>but I think it's about like the most<br>strongest place or like yeah it's just<br>like the strongest place on Earth<br>something like that but it doesn't<br>specifically refer<br>to<br>Aima not really I I don't know that the<br>N the naval the heart<br>yeaha or na yeah I don't know that but I<br>think that word is coming from Hinduism<br>I think so in<br>comes first budh I I I would think so as<br>well because in Buddhist Tech especially<br>in the v text when it comes to uh the<br>section of uh SAR boundary it doesn't<br>specifically mention the term uh anle or<br>Cel it it came up later with the local<br>culture and uh it has something to do<br>with the superstitious because in the<br>monastic perspective the the symbol of<br>SEMA doesn't mean anything at all to set<br>a boundary for a s member to perform uh<br>a formal act or to set a meeting or<br>something discuss something that matter<br>inside the S Community but for L people<br>they believe that uh the symbol the same<br>stone or SE symbol it it has some sort<br>of power that they could use to uh<br>protect themselves from Evil period or<br>something like that and and and a lot of<br>people buy that idea and and and uh and<br>they want to have SEMA rope something<br>like that there's a lot of thing to do<br>with the superstitious belief and I<br>totally agree with the lady who just<br>mentioned that perhap the term come from<br>Hinduism of romanism and and maybe we<br>can do research later about that yeah<br>yeah that's something that we haven't<br>mentioned that yeah that there's a<br>string that extends through the that<br>connects all the different stones that<br>eventually deposit and then and then<br>yeah people like to have have a segment<br>of that that string to keep as sort of a<br>string<br>yeah yeah that that that's all from my<br>side thank you okay thank you very<br>much and who else is there Savon<br>it some of these a couple of them are<br>people I met in India recently<br>uh<br>yes so thank you for<br>attending I know it's not easy to get on<br>you well are there any other questions<br>or<br>comments can I ask something about that<br>translation yeah yeah so youing that you<br>were translating text uh from kma to<br>English yeah and there was like a uh<br>there was like a demand to like<br>translate it from P to English some<br>parts of it but I was curious why there<br>was not like a complete translation of P<br>to Kim like I think that is more<br>interesting like why they were like not<br>translating the complete text or why<br>they were translating differently right<br>well actually there are<br>um uh there there is a complete<br>translation of of um the trpa into my<br>which was quite uh Elizabeth might<br>remember the exact dates of this it<br>began during in the 20s it began in the<br>20s it finished in the 60s it it was a<br>long-term project and involved it did<br>involve junat and huat and and other<br>major uh major scholar so um uh that did<br>they have it before no like you were<br>telling that you had problems with that<br>booklet and yes how when you were<br>translating it some people wanted you to<br>like go back to the P text and translate<br>it directly from P to K or have that P<br>sections included in the English<br>translation<br>right was worse than<br>that okay uh I I did not even think<br>about Consulting the um translation of<br>Thea uh when this raises issues that in<br>1933 when this pamphlet was published<br>whether that section of the TR had<br>already been translated or not um maybe<br>he was working on it um but um there is<br>a and I I'm not in a position to<br>evaluate um but<br>generally people say that translation<br>the command translation of is quite<br>quite good quality um I I'm not a<br>position to evaluate that<br>um the situation was that um when<br>I someone who read my my translation<br>which my translation did not pretend to<br>be a translation from the poly and yet<br>because it's clearly<br>the text is clearly makes reference to<br>the poly text<br>and then the scholar who was looking at<br>it said well this is what the poly Tex<br>says and it should be that and not this<br>and so it completes and I felt like well<br>I I have sufficient command of of C to<br>say that that this was an accurate<br>translation um but<br>I then the question is was someone who<br>knows the poly well maybe has a better<br>understanding of the text than than I<br>did working merely from the kai and so<br>it create a a sort of sensitive<br>situation and because I do argue that<br>there are times<br>when translating from Kamar is valid you<br>know and and this also relations to iCal<br>text and and the Traditions as they<br>evolve within within Cambodia uh and<br>yet because there is a tradition of<br>translating the same texts from poly<br>directly into English you can you also<br>cannot ignore that either and<br>so<br>um it I think it is an<br>interesting question an interesting<br>how you know to what extent you can have<br>a translation from the Kamai that that<br>would ignore the poly I think at the<br>time it was very frustrating and just<br>seem like an impossible situation but I<br>think<br>that uh Jason carbin and Eric Davis in<br>doing the work they did to<br>finally you know create this complex set<br>of footnotes which acknowledge both the<br>C and the P um it was a heroic effort<br>and I hope it was a good one so it said<br>that there was no complete poly canon in<br>1863 okay when they got a copy from King<br>Rama five<br>five<br>five completes what is the Vol count on<br>so they they had manuscripts you know<br>the P but they didn't have printed<br>complete printed thing and they had what<br>they used and they had a lot of ABI<br>Dum I think the majority of pom Le<br>manuscripts that date pre that time are<br>was the P were destroyed<br>from and um that body<br>import there's no evidence for a<br>complete like for example in Burma we<br>know that there was a complete poly<br>Canon because King mindon had them<br>inscribed on Stone and<br>planted this huge force of stone but we<br>don't know that cambodians who concerned<br>with the complete poly<br>Canon can can can I uh say<br>something regarding the translation that<br>I I have<br>uh I did some research about that before<br>and uh because it was a very interesting<br>topic to discuss about the de<br>translation in the case of Cambodia and<br>uh it it's a long process because it<br>took them like for almost three decades<br>if I'm I'm not wrong yeah and then uh<br>they have they they set up comedies and<br>they they<br>uh requested a lot of a part text from<br>different countries not only from<br>Thailand but uh from Burma they try to<br>compare the B Tex uh because the not<br>many country has a translated to<br>complete the Tia text at that time so<br>they use the P text to uh to to to<br>compare uh from one to another from one<br>country to another country and then<br>there study to uh translate uh uh the<br>text but uh they they have like uh done<br>it for several process uh before they<br>decided to print it they they send it to<br>uh because there was a six Buddhist<br>conso that uh held in Burma at that time<br>so they send the to this to the the<br>committee of uh Buddhist counil and to<br>discuss whether it is<br>possible to publish the the the whole<br>translation or not so this is a long<br>process this is not a short process and<br>the most interesting part of a Comm<br>translation is they keep<br>the script one side and then the<br>translation text another side so they<br>can compare for some part expert they<br>can uh read the part text and then look<br>at the translation to compare whether<br>the the translator at that times<br>uh were accurate or not so the the<br>modern pal scholar still can uh reviews<br>it still can examine it because the B<br>text was there and the translation text<br>on the other side this is what I I can<br>understand from Tex it was a definitely<br>a major major project um I I'm just<br>curious was the PO was the PO text<br>written in May mayor writing<br>in in my character yeah you're right yes<br>but uh when when we come here<br>to for example like B character or or<br>Thai character they are not much<br>different from one another so so the the<br>they kind of universal that because Tex<br>did not invent it budh because in the<br>ter tradition so it started from Sri<br>Lanka and then moved to a different<br>place of another part of the world<br>yes this is what I can understand from<br>the transl Translating process of<br>yeah thank thank<br>you yeah thank you for sending the link<br>to the<br>yor um article on<br>you<br>yeah okay you're talking about something<br>he's written about s thank<br>you I think what is interesting about<br>translating um a b text a bilingual text<br>that what you that what you did<br>translating the B text bilingual text<br>when I did it I don't didn't think of it<br>in that terms but now I think that's<br>what we should call and um um it<br>interesting because so if it's in<br>py so normal people wouldn't be able to<br>access that portion but when it comes to<br>um the bilingual text it reflects that<br>this part is important that why local<br>like all K people would like to<br>understand what the classical text is<br>talking so that why I think what you did<br>it's it's very interesting yeah so it<br>reflects the popularity of that portion<br>yes and then and reflect how people like<br>how the local people understand what the<br>classical text yeah is about and that's<br>that is there is a I think so there<br>might be some different interpretation<br>or translation yes but that that person<br>like should not or is it's one of the<br>most important yeah figure in that times<br>so this is very important to look at how<br>he interprets that yeah that body<br>portions yeah<br>so so yeah it's his interpretation isn't<br>it in the 1930s yeah so you don't have<br>any OU<br>version like from the other<br>scholar in the<br>C no no okay yeah<br>so I mean there is the Comm so you could<br>go to the Mahaba but this is like H<br>Tat's commentary yes yes so it's<br>like it is very accessible I mean like<br>so local people would would be able to<br>understand but he was not really um he<br>didn't depart that much from the text he<br>was mostly trying summarizing the text<br>and um yeah but it's in a handy booklet<br>it's not in like<br>100 and it's very practical handbook I<br>saw the SEMA installation at the CH<br>cromw in<br>ockland and<br>they brought monks from Cambodia and one<br>monk was holding this yeah in his hand<br>and you know going now now we do this<br>now we do that right yeah you know so it<br>was like he was using it right right<br>yeah yeah but it was a more recent<br>public it like paperback yeah yeah yeah<br>because there was like this time was<br>kind of booklets were kind of popular in<br>a way yeah inexpensive yeah because<br>because modern education was coming from<br>one side and that was really the printed<br>booklets were still fairly new in<br>Cambodia at that time because in Sri<br>Lanka also they had this textbooks<br>coming out with summaries of Buddhism<br>and how to live your life and something<br>like that at that time 19th century yeah<br>so maybe it was like to compete with<br>right the English text coming from<br>missionary schools and all yeah maybe I<br>don't know I'm just exactly and and you<br>could afford it you could go buy it and<br>then take it back to your temple yeah<br>it's like use it and<br>it wouldn't be sacred like a<br>pomet so you can make your notes on it<br>translation<br>translation<br>yeah well are we ready to call it<br>day it's pretty interesting John I I'm<br>glad we had this discussion I appreciate<br>very much those here and and those and<br>the venerable<br>online um contributed to this discussion<br>uh I'm as I said these things are<br>fascinating to me it's not the primary<br>focus of my research and so I'm very<br>eager to learn from all of you as well<br>and so uh thank you very much and um I<br>hope we'll see you all<br>tomorrow<br>okay thank you yes yes you<br>bye so you've got to hit oh I hit leave<br>here<br>okay</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
