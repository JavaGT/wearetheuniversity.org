Mana Moana reinforces connected genealogies of Māori and Pacific peoples across deep time and space beyond the shores of Aotearoa, New Zealand. <br><br>How do we better enable placemaking and cultural identity through the built environment? What can we do to enable the wellbeing of Indigenous communities of the present time? How does the profession of architecture respond to these cultural shifts across the Trans-Tasman?<br><br>The three lectures aim to provoke, educate and inspire our conversations about placemaking, cultural positioning and the transformational possibilities of architecture.<br>-<br>This panel discussion features some of Aotearoa New Zealand’s leading designers and thinkers of placemaking:<br>Associate Professor Leali‘ifano Albert L Refiti (AUT)<br>Rau Hoskins (DesignTribe)<br>Elisapeta Heta (Jasmax)<br>Jade Kake (Matakohe Architecture+Urbanism)<br>Tuputau Lelaulu (MAU

and<br>drink out of the one go and the<br>engagement in this is the Oneness from<br>our our Pacific um specific belief in<br>specific Traditions however uh we're<br>weary of the time we're wey of many<br>other factors so we have many service<br>and we're not going to allow one culture<br>to dominate but we will allow uh jamat<br>just to to facilitate this process and<br>when you receive your cup they will take<br>two steps back and they will respect you<br>and honor You by CLP whereby then you<br>can consume the cover and we've told the<br>the server make sure it's right up to<br>the room for Al that's how they look uh<br>we start off with the six the first six<br>and then we will continue with the final<br>four and just for those in the the front<br>they're representing all of our man<br>today before it comes back on to ourside<br>but comes back onto ourside similar<br>Traditions similar Customs uh just<br>different ways of doing it um and then<br>we will conclude once uh again uh once<br>the they once outside has finished<br>consuming and we'll just take just the<br>front row again just to represent all of<br>the hosts and here at White Papo the<br>number one University in all of Oakland<br>and New Zealand uh then we will come<br>include with our W and then bring this<br>part to the end so so can I have a ghost<br>Cup on<br>pap W I think this is going to make

there's so many<br>different layers of con connection to<br>the people in the room and also to this<br>particular<br>place uh which um I was lucky to be a<br>student when we opened um wife Pap<br>marai and to be uh living with caras at<br>the time two of the caras were working<br>on on the on the far and um and to be<br>part of the the the ru that um were were<br>opening the um opening the complex and<br>Med Med pinfold had written this um part<br>was about 45 lines long so a lot of the<br>to had them tape to the back of their<br>shirt so you just get behind<br>those that's the only way we want to get<br>through that<br>PO um so so um pleased to be here today<br>I'm work variously um in uh Academia<br>with unitech um and with design tribe<br>Architects and in research um working<br>with Albert at the moment and um really<br>privileged to uh be deepening my<br>appreciation<br>of um culture and traditions in relation<br>to<br>to uh particularly in Tahiti Nui uh in<br>Samoa and in Hawaii<br>and so um being able to get to some of<br>those places and uh and um in particular<br>sit with some of those Remnant tuna um<br>is a is a real privilege and um<br>certainly reminds me of how in the' 70s<br>and ' 80s when you were being educated<br>in<br>aloa uh you were your the education<br>system separated you from your Moi<br>cousins uh they were other um and uh<br>it's only with this uh re-education<br>process that we realize how close we are<br>in terms of our faka Papa our Waka<br>Traditions our our real and um also our<br>our architecture so pleased to be here<br>PE<br>fore<br>speee<br>speee<br>foree<br>fore<br>foree<br>for<br>hey<br>up<br>foree<br>yeah<br>for<br>for<br>that's<br>see<br>up<br>yeah<br>foree<br>for<br>for<br>so<br>up<br>foree<br>up<br>f<br>foreign<br>foree<br>fore<br>we just going to sing a song and and<br>then we'll close this part of our<br>next<br>he<br>for<br>my name is<br>sh I'm here at School of Architecture<br>planning and also associate Pacific at<br>theart<br>indri<br>with our newly appointed assistant<br>Pacific uh we're very honored very<br>honored to be convening today's<br>b a discussion with our esteemed panel<br>our friends<br>Alo uh Ro I was my first boss as a<br>graduate desine tribe and um Albert was<br>always there during our research years<br>for LA<br>and our friends our friends our<br>colleagues our peers um T Mai J andisa<br>welcome thank you over the last few<br>months uh L and I have had the great<br>pleasure of facilitating the last three<br>2023 uh under this theme of man moanda<br>this has been a creative exercise for us<br>as academics and practitioners<br>alongside curating these talks we um<br>written this paper about<br>man which is about understanding the<br>place of Moana in Al<br>architecture it's soon to be published<br>in the Arts research<br>international our paper questions will<br>guide today's panel<br>ask all<br>right Moana opened with M Landscape<br>designer and academic Dr Elena<br>indigenous design director<br>WP and Tong architect<br>Andrew an executive and chair of the war<br>man board their talks reminded us how<br>different but complimentary our man<br>Moana positions are along the journey<br>towards plac in<br>Al Dr said too fast slowed down<br>we need time to work through it all but<br>we need designed allies to make space to<br>make room for M design Authority within<br>our<br>industry Warfare share design ideas<br>about what can be what can we<br>collaborate and embed into um from our<br>inal<br>links with<br>architecture<br>in our second lecture by Professor PA<br>and Professor Alison PA<br>from Australia they said first<br>understand country with a Capital<br>C before attempting to design on and<br>with<br>country understand country through song<br>lines through dream time stories and<br>knowing who country is so I'm giving you<br>a very short version by the way so<br>please go it out it's all online uh<br>slide so tonight we continue the theme<br>of Manana which acknowledges The<br>ancestral connections across this Great<br>Pacific Ocean that connects us all<br>stitching together our sess our<br>connectedness which gives us all money<br>we are very honored to have Al's top<br>experts speaking to to these spaces and<br>places and ideas our panelists and um we<br>want to just say say thank you again<br>thank you for your mana and your<br>e so we continue with ideas about<br>indigenizing places indigenizing design<br>thinking and going deep into time and<br>space to understand our lines of<br>connection and perhaps disconnection<br>when designing in and for<br>our the man of the F the man of the<br>what happens when they touch feel<br>overlap are they distorted harmonious<br>unable conflicted and the V or our<br>ancestral relations be our momentum<br>forward tonight L and I want this to be<br>a safe place safe space for our<br>panelists our audience um we acknowledge<br>that the topics are culturally<br>sensitive and this is a platform to<br>speak about issues openly and safely to<br>improve and strengthen our as Architects<br>sh<br>folks we didn't want it be to be too<br>perfect so we deliberately knock the<br>paper down<br>relax um look<br>um as sh has mentioned we time get the<br>pr of tonight but I just want to Second<br>also a welcome<br>um it's really important um that we<br>acknowledge these processes of the poor<br>F and the other and also to be blessed<br>inhabit in such a structure I think it's<br>extremely important there's a common<br>saying in our in our culture and I'm<br>throughout<br>that translates to if there is no<br>language there is no culture if there is<br>no culture the villag is in darkness now<br>recent Explorations around the student<br>briefs here at our school of<br>architecture we've explored these themes<br>in terms of trying<br>to revive and trying to go back to the f<br>terms of a s War brief that we're<br>looking at why because we're starting to<br>lose our language and process like the<br>poor F and the<br>yba rejuvenates them and I've got my<br>13-year-old son here that I actually<br>forced him to come he's on holiday and<br>he thinks that he should be left alone<br>to play on Xbox you<br>know today you're going to learn<br>something about our culture today and<br>many other cultures here that are<br>present so<br>without further<br>Ado um I just want to<br>welcome um associate professor<br>Mike um Davis who I've been<br>trying to take up his Papa because<br>he's got links to samore and they're not<br>very small links he's actually tied to<br>the kings of samore mar titles so I've<br>actually called him Lai which is the<br>very our know um son of Mal in sore and<br>so we're very very privileged well I'm<br>very privileged to have him here because<br>he's also trying to get in touch with<br>this side of his culture as<br>well<br>than I<br>am currently acting in school at

knowledge<br>other that sh and I know um<br>just all right before I hand the mic<br>over to<br>um to<br>sh my know shamain spoke about cultural<br>safety um and also cultural sensitive<br>stuff um so to our panelist if you feel<br>the Walkers being hit hard by the wind<br>or there's a a road wave coming around<br>the other side it's only for a little<br>while because as you navigate through<br>that storm there's going to be some<br>clear water on the other side but we got<br>to go through the storm to get through<br>to the other side so without further Ado<br>I hand M over to<br>sh thank you thank you for the problem<br>about the um this is a warmer right<br>so can our panelists kind of remind us<br>your cultural design role within your<br>practice within your<br>firm and in one word Define what is<br>Al and so sorry You' got a microphone<br>there we could<br>look is there like is that on yes right<br>so is there like a longer answer and<br>then the one word or am I trying to<br>answer everything one word cuz I don't<br>know if that's as you wish okay cool<br>like<br>um go closer yeah getting coaching how's<br>this everybody great um in my firm so I<br>started my company so I was everything<br>and now I get to be what I what everyone<br>tells me I need to be and sometimes<br>things that I want to do um but in terms<br>of cultural design a lot of the time we<br>work directly with M<br>Anda and sometimes e as clients and so<br>it's really down to helping them<br>articulate their cultural values in the<br>way that they want to in terms of the<br>built environment whether it's buildings<br>or landscape whatever and then the more<br>tricky role that we keep saying yes to<br>is on major kind of Civic and Commercial<br>projects where we're there at the beest<br>of our Hau but it's a government project<br>and there's always a sort of tension<br>line because the government client might<br>have suit and aims your Hau have got<br>suit and aims you're probably working<br>with another architect they've got<br>certain aims and values and that's a bit<br>of a tension but I guess we keep showing<br>up because ALU ask us to be there in<br>those spaces and I think it was spoken<br>to really well um at the beginning and<br>especially in um I qued or it's really<br>about we want to see our identity in the<br>environment reflected in a meaningful<br>way um and I always this is I won't keep<br>it I'll keep it kind of short but um<br>something I always think about whenever<br>we do this work of reinscribing our<br>cultural narratives into the environment<br>is that I want our young people to see<br>themselves see themselves located to me<br>they're always the primary audience and<br>you know it keeps raing out from there<br>through two visitors and you know<br>everyone's going to get different layers<br>of meaning but I think for our own young<br>people who are residing within their or<br>within Alor I want them to see their<br>themselves in their environment and that<br>can be the touchone to discovering more<br>deeper knowledge of their identity and<br>their POA and those P that LE to place<br>um and my word<br>is thank you<br>J<br>okay looking at the floor<br>um okay my role has changed quite a lot<br>over the years but<br>um a lot of it is similar to what J's<br>describing I find I'm often the middle<br>point between<br>clients<br>and uh Mii and their aspirations and<br>you're often trying to broker a<br>conversation um to get better outcomes<br>for everybody but ultimately to be able<br>to get our T to see themselves 100% I<br>agree with that um as the years have<br>gone by I've become less and less<br>interested in calling myself an<br>architect so to speak CU I find I do<br>more talking and storytelling um and<br>that all the other parts that I do in my<br>world making art singing that's kind of<br>my ha um the sort of wider field of<br>architecture um one a bit of a better<br>term has become the place I've T to<br>deside so I've sort of made a role that<br>fits what I'm interested in to help our<br>people to the best of my ability um so<br>that's a really bad way of describing my<br>job description um which has never fit<br>on a piece of paper anyway um my<br>response to your question about the one<br>word is I'm actually going to challenge<br>the term placemaking<br>um it's come about I think in quite an<br>interesting Paro eurocentric<br>um sort of lens where we as humans think<br>we make place um the term I like to use<br>is being plac made um it came up in a<br>conversation we were actually having um<br>in Toronto a few years ago a lot of the<br>indigenous uh Faro over there were<br>talking about how they felt like um a<br>lot of they don't say Pacquiao but a lot<br>of Pacquiao were coming and and making<br>place for them like look at this<br>beautiful place we've made um and they<br>were sort of like places makes us um we<br>are made by our<br>environment we um are a reflection of<br>their story so I prefer to think about<br>being plac made than being placemakers<br>it doesn't answer your question but that<br>is my word right thank you so Papa<br>Place<br>May<br>um yes so my role uh is well back in<br>2017 16 17 we started M Studios so there<br>were four of us architecture<br>Brands um from unitech as well as down<br>in Victoria<br>University so my my role at the moment<br>so that's been six six years I think we<br>turned six this year 65 six 10 two six<br>six thank you very much um and we're<br>working across a few different projects<br>and mostly inside the housing space and<br>seeing the need from our families<br>particularly ourf families in<br>Al and family or the the funny or our<br>homes are our anchor place and what<br>grounds us to<br>place um so my role really is kind of<br>sitting across a number of different<br>places um from Business Development to<br>really building the Capi in capacity of<br>our our team we're relatively young team<br>most of them being here right now most<br>of them probably don't like me right now<br>but that's okay um no it's not okay<br>sorry but it's you know we're a young<br>team we're a maturing team and we're a<br>developing team but it's the process<br>that we're committed to in order to the<br>outcomes that our families really need<br>here I'll one uh and<br>so my so that was a word that interprets<br>placemaking to us right so I believe a a<br>fundamental part of our process is<br>really been about celebrating the<br>concept of Mo or Mo uh in one Ando<br>communities and so Mo or MO is a A pfic<br>or one and term which means to uh to be<br>steadfast to hold firmly on to by<br>looking at it philosophically well and<br>also acknowledging the the<br>many um the M movements or M hisor<br>Al bit of a history list but<br>over commonly known as was a movement<br>which resisted colonization from German<br>and Brit New Zealand Administration in s<br>in the late 1800s early<br>1900s uh Mo for them was their<br>opposition so Mo meant their their<br>stance or their view points or their<br>commitment and they were resistant<br>against the the forces trying to<br>overthrow their cultural customs and<br>their values and their beliefs and<br>ultimately they led to the independence<br>of s 1962 and correct me if I'm wrong<br>but one of the first mon Nations to be<br>independent from colonization in the mid<br>1900s there was Malu who was know quite<br>influential in Reviving W<br>voyaging which a lot of us string or<br>attach our identity to today very<br>important part<br>and then there's K from tin reclaiming<br>our stories of identity and Reclamation<br>the resistance of imperialism and things<br>like that<br>so um we didn't know a lot of this back<br>you know six seven years ago but now<br>today I believe for me placemaking<br>is um is Mo or Mo and for us Mo or MO is<br>about understanding our place in the<br>world and understanding our role in<br>being able to regenerate the values of<br>the beliefs but also just to be able to<br>support our families and our communities<br>to see what they want to see uh in their<br>t or their place and their stronger<br>sense of belong<br>so yeah I'll speak a little bit more to<br>that later on but for me the word is<br>M than thank<br>you um yes so I'm working at mode um<br>which is mainly it's an Australian<br>company and it has one office in New<br>Zealand um our office in New Zealand has<br>is made up of uh staff who are from all<br>over the world so I'm kind of the um<br>cultural champion of the office so if<br>they if they don't know a word or<br>something they're like Mari what's this<br>mean I don't<br>know but it's kind of that um so so we<br>uh work a lot in Corrections correction<br>facilities um and there's a new push to<br>engage with communities a lot more um<br>and so a lot of our work we have to work<br>with um cultural advisers or<br>facilitators who are usually um from<br>certain e um we projects can study so my<br>role is kind of kind of to interface<br>with these guys and um and be able to<br>filter and um process knowledge and<br>information<br>between um to the to the company and you<br>know to these um uh facilitators who who<br>are then um communicating with the<br>community so it's um trying to enable<br>that um voice to come through through<br>the design um it's not always easy um<br>I've try to um increase the cultural<br>competency of the<br>firm um but that's sort of work in<br>progress I guess um the word Place<br>making I walked through elim um just<br>last week I to kill and I haven't been<br>there for like 20 years and there was<br>some po that stand there that been<br>carved and we did that in our um second<br>year um and what it made me think was<br>just of all the um people that I shared<br>that that time so I think um I think<br>offer love is the is The Binding is The<br>Binding um element<br>which cuz CU places are about people and<br>it's about memories of people and these<br>what just a<br>recap resistance<br>love I mean<br>um we established the tribe in<br>1994 and we were four four years out of<br>Artic school we<br>um thought we had rattled around enough<br>in in various roles and offices and<br>building and so on and came together as<br>a a collective and um the cope up are<br>then and and is still now to try to make<br>uh architectural expertise available to<br>communities that who don't normally have<br>access to that<br>expertise and um so my role has kind of<br>moved a lot in the in the last nearly<br>few 30 years and<br>um a lot a lot of the time now we're<br>working on larger projects and<br>I'm my main role is to connect the uh<br>securely connect maninoa groups to the<br>design process and to be part of the<br>cultural design<br>responses uh for those for those uh<br>individuals who represent the Hau and<br>their e and their raka in in some cases<br>M<br>um another one of my roles that sort of<br>front of mine right now is um we just<br>today finished our first<br>W for the inaugural<br>manay uh curriculum course which is a<br>Marty housing leadership<br>program and so we've just got our first<br>15 um to on board and uh launched<br>the um Copa on um Monday night in the<br>last two days we've been taking them<br>around or ar um<br>to<br>to to<br>Pap and to co- house in<br>grin and<br>um I guess uh the name of that for is<br>M and um and that the that is is really<br>about um remembering the utmost<br>significance of of ker and uh and<br>everything that we do uh so if we are<br>securely connected to place and to the<br>people of that place then then we will<br>be well so the the name that I've been<br>thinking about just since um you posed<br>that question<br>is which has really took to that um<br>long-standing<br>wellbeing um in the name order of course<br>is a is a well um entrenched in our um<br>Mo and um I think it's at its heart is<br>is what we all aspire to through the<br>field of of<br>architecture and um picking up on um<br>Elizabeth's commentary around<br>terminology I think it's I think it's<br>really important and I think that um<br>time has come to for us to reclaim and<br>reclaim the the terms that are used at<br>Alo um a term that we particularly<br>resisted in the early 2000s was Urban<br>Design and um so the the whole um<br>T push in from<br>20056 uh onwards was around um re<br>retaking control over the of some of<br>some terminology so the the name that we<br>came up with at that time in English was<br>uh cultural landscapes cuz cuz when you<br>use the term cultural landscapes there<br>are people in your mind when you use the<br>term Urban Design there may be buildings<br>there may be hard<br>surfaces uh there may be modified<br>environments but then but the what does<br>not come to mind is actually<br>people um so I think it's really<br>important that we um in<br>um in these conversations to um come<br>together<br>and<br>terminology um whatever is appropriate<br>and um at least here in Al or push back<br>when appropriate against terms which<br>which we think are actually recolonizing<br>Albert what what did I do uh when I<br>finished Arch School same time as R I<br>worked in architecture so I used to be a<br>working architect for Lane Priest No<br>Lane and Richard priest and then I went<br>overseas and worked for Fury herin<br>mainly most of the project when I was<br>working was mainly in the art museum art<br>galleries uh houses or Studios for<br>artists so I kind of fell into that<br>world and when I came back to New<br>Zealand uh did same thing with for the<br>museum for a number of years and then I<br>um decided to become an academic because<br>I had started some studies in London<br>when I was there um kind of lazy I<br>didn't I didn't have the I didn't have<br>the attention that some people had about<br>architecture so I went back to my books<br>and I love I I<br>love archives reading and stuff like<br>that so my current job is uh I'm the<br>convener for the bana research cluster<br>at aut School of Art and Design and uh<br>it's been going for around 10 years 2002<br>2012 sorry<br>2013 um<br>we first one of the first<br>thing that got me interested in the<br>current work that I do is that this<br>building I worked on this building in<br>2002<br>2003 and previously to that I did some<br>field work at sore and<br>predominantly Albert Wick gave me a<br>ground to go there and I wasn't<br>interested in sore and architecture CU I<br>I lived and grew up there and yeah okay<br>they buildings they never change but<br>what's interesting is why they never<br>changed so that got me thinking about<br>because our training at architecture<br>school is all about invention of new<br>forms and new the novel how come these<br>kind of forms although you know it's<br>build in New Zealand and all the things<br>are wrong about it as I can see but<br>somehow the cohesiveness of the things<br>stays the same got me interested about<br>this thing called V so some of you are<br>familiar with the notion of V so it's<br>not so much the artifact or the the the<br>um the apparatus that hold us together<br>in space it's the thing that happens in<br>here the rituals the<br>ceremonies the designated uh sitting<br>position of people and the hierarchy<br>that goes on so for maybe five or six<br>years we've been doing this uh research<br>on V which coming to the end of this<br>year and the current research that I'm<br>returning back now now I have a good<br>handle on why why architecture emerges<br>in the Pacific is now I'm working grow<br>on this mastered funded project on<br>artifacts of relations and now will I<br>and ra and number of other researchers<br>from Hawaii and Tahiti and here and out<br>here we're looking<br>at then the artifact why if V this<br>social system that we have is important<br>uh in fui in most of our uh places of<br>worship in Cathedral you can apply the<br>same kind of logic why the artifact then<br>what is the relationship between those<br>ritual social system that gave R to<br>those things and the art the<br>architecture the<br>ornamentation and of course uh what<br>happens to all that uh with the Advent<br>of technology and capitalism and so<br>forth so that's kind of where what I<br>what I do the word one word quickly uh<br>probably about placemaking is friendship<br>really I<br>mean I wasn't born here so I don't you<br>know I don't feel like like I can just<br>make place but all relationship that<br>I've had with tataa here and other<br>migrants and other kiwis all about<br>friendship and in some sense gives me<br>the sense that I find a place or I can<br>talk about things safely you know a<br>wonderful friendship with people from<br>tuoy because of people I've known there<br>and it's probably the the uh uh G Fen<br>that I feel closer to but also just in<br>the last 15 years with uh uh latifat Ori<br>uh some wonderful friendships there so<br>yeah I I think<br>it's and some I think that that for me<br>as a as a migrant has to be the the<br>reason why I find there is a<br>authenticity about Place otherwise yeah<br>I'm just a a migr and<br>well thank you for opening our<br>discussion with your ideas of<br>baking um noted we need to use our own<br>real our own languages<br>to uh work on those<br>terminologies so<br>friendship long standing while being a l<br>of people wonderful thank you look we've<br>got a number of questions but we may um<br>bring it down from four to two see how<br>we<br>go this is the long one to<br>introduce some have said that New<br>Zealand's emphasis on biculturalism<br>since 1840 has dimmed down the ancestral<br>connections between my peoples to focus<br>more on the New Zealand nation state my<br>scholar<br>Alis Likens this historical and deep<br>relationship of Mar Pacific peoples to<br>an underwater volcano whereby the tip is<br>what we know Mari but it's connections<br>to the Pacific are<br>obscured however recent Works mostly by<br>indigenous researchers have shifted our<br>attention to understanding deep time and<br>space beyond the colonial<br>project like the writings of the lake<br>ater who says the mo Pacific Ocean has<br>always been our lines of<br>connection recent documentaries by<br>Scotty Morrison titled Origins who's<br>watched that I think most of you right<br>exactly again reaffirms our deep<br>connections across lwa and all the way<br>here to<br>Al and thank you Ro and Albert for<br>sharing some of the project you're<br>working on which I know is aligned with<br>this thinking and I'd love to hear more<br>everyone else too so considering all of<br>this our first question is what is your<br>to whichever version<br>to and how does that position inform how<br>you<br>practice I'd like to begin<br>with<br>ESS okay the mic<br>there has the M passing it to the uncles<br>can't<br>take I think it was last year there was<br>actually a uh Symposium here and I spoke<br>about and the first question was from<br>P you pH and say what is<br>of um and I you know I I took me some f<br>price cuz I thought I i' organized it in<br>my hand but I I think you<br>know uh one other really important thing<br>the only way I can say uh I can have a<br>position on the treaty is is is as an<br>indigenous person what would be an as an<br>indigenous<br>to my indigenous people of the country<br>here uh what would my position is to<br>them and I said to PA my position is<br>that I would not feel ease as an<br>indigenous person unless your land is<br>over return to you or the indigenous<br>people of the country should get there<br>what one of is the thing that they<br>belong to because I come from a country<br>where we seing about our land we we have<br>titles that fixes the land so yeah and<br>my my my position is really one from an<br>indigenous perspective that I would not<br>feel uh at ease as an indigenous person<br>if the indigenous people of here and out<br>here don't get that hand back I would<br>not feel yeah I I still feel an easy<br>being an indigenous person in the world<br>but that doesn't<br>matter it's one that<br>project um anyway that I keep thinking<br>micing thank you um thank you Albert and<br>you know I think um it's uh it's really<br>important<br>um that um<br>we put ourselves in our the position of<br>the other and if we have been born and<br>raised in an indigenous culture where<br>your where your is Undisputed it's it's<br>much easier to put yourself in that<br>position and then and then speak to that<br>land the<br>um my T um argued vifer ly for the<br>signing of TI or white and on the 5th of<br>February 1840 they<br>were in a 6-hour debate at White tongi<br>uh and we're lucky that the uh that<br>debate was actually recorded was<br>transcribed at the time so we we<br>effectively know what was said and by<br>whom and um our tuper at the time said<br>look we've come too far<br>um with our relationships with um toii<br>with Paka and we now need<br>to um ensure<br>that the 2,000 British subjects that are<br>here are kept in order and that Queen<br>Victoria fulfills her role as in terms<br>of looking after them and and often<br>their lawlessness so um I come from a AO<br>who were Pro treaty<br>um and then of course we all know the<br>history since the S of tiity um in<br>2014 he uh took uh one of the first<br>claims to be heard was the sovereignty<br>claim and um that claim was effectively<br>going to the heart<br>of and and he's saying well we we did<br>not sign over sovereignty um<br>to uh to the the queen or the<br>crown and uh furthermore we couldn't do<br>that you can't sign over a sovereignty<br>of of your nation your children's your<br>grandchildren's nation to another Power<br>it's not it's not in your power to<br>actually do that um so the the tribunal<br>um came back in 2014 and actually um<br>based on their research agreed that the<br>Chiefs uh who signed to white t in Ed<br>Whitey uh did not seek<br>sovereignty um and of course that uh mic<br>drop um has has kind of um kind of been<br>uh totally forgotten by successive<br>governments s that time because it's<br>just too<br>fundamental uh to the way that our<br>structures have been developed to for<br>for any government s to actually um<br>comprehend what it really<br>means um not not withstanding that we<br>have a settlement process in up which is<br>finally um finally beginning to move<br>ahead at a Hau level uh so we will<br>getting we are getting groupings of Hau<br>uh coming together um to um to begin<br>that settlement process so I guess it's<br>very personal to me um and I guess it's<br>driven my um push when I was studying at<br>the School of Architecture uh uh very<br>disillusioned with the uh the content of<br>course except for um people like Mike<br>Austin um of was very disillusioned and<br>um began to agitate for uh changes to<br>way that actually was taught in in<br>Alo and um that's pushed me into um uh<br>teaching uh roles at o University<br>initially and then at Unity to try and<br>um improve the U standard of um<br>education so that we can um create<br>better architects who are who hold um<br>solid knowledge of of faka Papa of pako<br>of<br>manaa um and and who can be allies as<br>has mentioned as has been mentioned and<br>who can be part of our our move to<br>progressively reclaim uh our our<br>cultural landscapes so good thank<br>you<br>was that you keeping up for the<br>mic<br>yeah um I think that's a really<br>important point and I'm so glad we<br>started with that uh I actually really<br>got way too many things to do this nay<br>so I need to kind of simmer down my<br>thoughts cuz I really was interested in<br>your first convocation before the<br>question um I grew up in Australia which<br>is I think a bit of a different<br>positionality and experience um and I<br>know there's others in the room who are<br>Marty and grew up in<br>Australia um and you know my experience<br>at that time and I know we've kind of<br>moved past you know like things like<br>Polynesian as an outdated term but when<br>I was growing up that's really how I<br>identified because there was all hardly<br>any Mar that weren't my own Faro and so<br>it was like there was s there was tongas<br>before new way and also the indigenous<br>people um of the area that we lived in<br>you know so we felt a real collectivity<br>and solidarity with each other and so to<br>me that was really normal but then when<br>I moved to Al as a young person and also<br>actually just coming back here when I<br>was you know kid and a teenager I<br>actually saw is it racism lateral<br>violence I saw that and even in my own<br>family and some of our old people who I<br>love dearly but some of those aunties<br>who were like you know they're different<br>to us and and carrying those outdated<br>attitudes and I found that confronting<br>sad not quite sure how to reconcile that<br>in myself um I can understand where that<br>thinking comes from because we've had<br>social policies thrust upon us that<br>create that division but I Australia has<br>many problems but I did grow up at least<br>with that benefit of thinking of us as<br>fonga and and not seeing that division<br>until I came to Alo and really could see<br>it um the next follow through on that<br>story is that um I recently been sort of<br>exploring a bit more in the Pacific um<br>and we went to ronga um my partner and I<br>and we also took a class online for like<br>six months learning a bit of the<br>um and that was just such an eye opening<br>experience and also other trips I've<br>taken to Hawaii and so on because it<br>really reframed what is Mari and I met<br>Mari froma and Mo and you know parts of<br>Tahiti and they had their own real and<br>some of their real was very simil<br>similar to ours and so it kind of<br>decentered us as M of Al and go actually<br>there's a whole bunch of us and we're<br>really really connected and I think that<br>if we haven't and you know I get it I'm<br>educated I'm pretty privileged at this<br>point in my life and it didn't start<br>that way I've got the ability to go to<br>these places and make these connections<br>that me as a young person like just<br>completely ignorant I wouldn't have<br>known all of this stuff except that you<br>know we're in Australia and there there<br>were other people from you know other<br>young people from the Pacific and we<br>felt we could relate to each other<br>um yeah so I guess what am I trying to<br>say I think that these divisions are<br>ones of colonization and political<br>making that we feel very deeply here in<br>Alo Australia has different problems but<br>I think we can see our connectivity<br>across the Pacific and then the more<br>that we're able to break down those<br>barriers um and find our connections<br>back to each other with events like this<br>and some of the really cool trips across<br>the Pacific some of us have been<br>privileged to go on I I I think the<br>better that we are to understand<br>ourselves in that way and then the last<br>point I'll make cuz I know this answer<br>is so long is that the treaty thing it's<br>actually quite tricky because I think<br>you know our across the Pacific are<br>always are ala and weren a vision<br>differently that agreement has a really<br>specific relationship with a colonial<br>power and I don't think we should forget<br>that so I I hear people talking about<br>things like you know where do tow we sit<br>where do T want to sit in relation to<br>the treaty if you're not tongue to fway<br>you must be tongue to Titi which I'm not<br>sure I agree with and I I don't have the<br>answers but given that that's what<br>structuring our country that's still<br>under a colonial power I think within<br>our communities we need to have those<br>wer and so I mean I guess this is just<br>one taleno in one space but these kind<br>of conversations I think are really<br>beneficial and I'm thinking also of the<br>work that Asians supporting Tanga have<br>led to caucus and work through these<br>issues in our specific groups and come<br>together I kind of think just more of<br>that um and I'll leave it there<br>yeah I conrat to you<br>um yes I have lots of thoughts running<br>through my mind as well so structuring<br>them might be<br>challenging um I suppose I've been<br>fortunate I guess funly enough through<br>my career to explore a lot of these<br>conversations and discussions it's the<br>privilege that I guess J's talking about<br>that has actually recontextualized as<br>well the very personal experience of my<br>upbringing being that Mom is you know s<br>talking loud and dad is mildy um and I<br>grew up with this is a very personal<br>story but I grew up with Dad actively<br>talking about how he used to fight for s<br>in um f um him and his brothers used to<br>go and beat them up I don't know why but<br>they did um and it's this sort of old<br>rhetoric that dad used to have that he<br>kind of thought was funny but it was<br>around that<br>um that period in the 70s 60s 70s where<br>maldi and Pacific peoples who had come<br>to Alor in large numbers were all<br>fighting for those labor jobs um I know<br>that's not where the division started<br>but I know that in my dad's mind it was<br>he that got a job or the other guy got<br>the job um and there were these sort of<br>falsities uh of of<br>Separation um in our communities and<br>then de married Theon woman like it made<br>no sense in my mind as a kid I couldn't<br>understand why he was sort of why he<br>found those stories so funny and then he<br>married a s woman and his entire Faro<br>was salon and he was just like yeah this<br>is you know anyway confusing<br>um so I remember having that in my mind<br>and being quite confused actually as a<br>kid because I would hear my nna speaking<br>to her siblings and<br>lots of the words sounded like T maldi<br>um and I couldn't quite understand like<br>I just I can never<br>contextualize this idea of difference<br>when they seem to be way more in common<br>than there was different um and then<br>also just as a kid you know knowing that<br>we were talking about our Waka and our<br>Pepa and that our Waka came from this<br>you know magical place called Hawaii and<br>Hawaii and then you grow up and you<br>realize where Hawaii is it's<br>through you know so it's just this is a<br>bit of a a baby story I guess just just<br>sort of talking to that personal aspect<br>of it's taken me a long time in my head<br>to get to a place of<br>realizing the sheer level of<br>connectivity and in particular the last<br>two years of my life working on projects<br>like the F Mal with um with Albert<br>trying to create this idea of a pen<br>Pacific F which pfic architecture<br>doesn't exist we know that but thinking<br>about um you know the the strength or<br>the power of our connectivity and where<br>some of these stories come from and how<br>you might um create an architecture that<br>could potentially represent all of us<br>and and as Albert has said it's actually<br>largely come back to the ways we might<br>codify the building through Arch or we<br>might think about the types of ritual or<br>ceremony that would occur inside of the<br>building that would in fact make the<br>building of all of timana Aiwa not from<br>one island or another my own research<br>and a project that I very tentatively<br>going to talk about where I'm going to<br>exhibit in Venice next year um in the<br>ocean space<br>um uh exhibition space that will open as<br>a part of the vale J scers anyway um and<br>that project is also looking to connect<br>through story um our relationship back<br>to each other so again when I was in<br>haai with um actually most of us here<br>this crew and you fellas um singing<br>karaoke with our friends um I remember<br>being at a ha with Lily kala and she was<br>doing a Oli out to the Moana and I had<br>this moment of going holy I can see<br>the other side of the ocean I felt like<br>I had a more holistic view of where I<br>sat and like J was saying my M got quite<br>Des censored and I liked that I I<br>finally felt a sense of being from this<br>body that was so expensive that I hadn't<br>quite experienced<br>before so the work that I'm producing<br>for ocean space without giving anything<br>away we be trying to bring our real and<br>our ideas of of the ocean as a body back<br>to witness um so that we can celebrate<br>her and her fullness and I will talk<br>about it as her in that instance cuz I'm<br>relating back to a particular pako that<br>I've heard about in terms<br>OFA which was a ATA that was with rui<br>before rui was with Papu um who was the<br>ocean body who split herself apart to<br>allow Papu to come up through um so this<br>is when the ocean was a singular body um<br>so I guess<br>again longwinded answer but through the<br>beauty of the things I get to research<br>in this I've been able to stitch<br>together back my understanding of who I<br>am and it has to be personal first so<br>that I can actually do the work with our<br>communities to help s ourselves back<br>together cuz it's an absolute falsity<br>that we're different um yeah that's it<br>thank<br>you<br>yeah just quite just want to acknowledge<br>the cord at the moment and the range and<br>I I'm going to admit that when I saw<br>this at the first question part of this<br>uh panel was was quite a a strong<br>tension um<br>and a healthy tension and a good tension<br>because it's ongoing conversations that<br>we have at the office but it's ongoing<br>conversations that I have in my head<br>it's ongoing conversation that I have<br>with my partner who is mildy and quite<br>tutu and in her own ways of being but<br>also being quite immersed with inside of<br>ha myself and like there's ongoing<br>conversations and dialogues with myself<br>every single day as a samon May standing<br>in the marai standing in a everyone<br>standing in heavy qud I'm just kind of<br>sitting there just you know it's a<br>constant navigation and it's a daily<br>navigation of who I am and what is my<br>position with inside<br>or more specifically what is my position<br>with inside my family in the setting of<br>a in the setting of a Hu in the setting<br>of an ewi particularly who has not gone<br>through their TI um settlement process<br>so but it's I'm also and I I understand<br>it's quite a privileged space but if I'm<br>speaking from a Pacifica perspective<br>which I think is a healthy conversation<br>for many pacifican to have and this a<br>conversation that I've had with my part<br>recently leading up to this cuz I think<br>this is the question I was most nervous<br>about was how do we have this<br>conversation particularly for paf<br>or<br>Tongan and our positioning of our Sal<br>with inside alter because I look at it<br>from a number of perspectives and I<br>don't know why my head works like that<br>but my head works like that<br>compartmentalizes perspectives I think<br>from a cultural perspective from a<br>conversation around<br>TI is naturally for us as people from<br>one or as<br>a is that you're always<br>acknowledging the of the the people of<br>place and for us as andf people being<br>here in just makes sense and it's a<br>cultural world view which I cannot<br>hold which I believe from<br>what that's TI at its Essence is is<br>trying to stipulate that is trying to<br>reaffirm that from people value and as I<br>just want to acknowledge too what Ro had<br>said around well that was the initial<br>intention but now almost 150 years after<br>that hasn't been the case so 150 years<br>our math is horrible today<br>anyway and so and the conversations with<br>my<br>partner uh around us was from a<br>professional perspective right from<br>looking at from that from that angle<br>was it's just it's quite hard<br>to quite hard to look at TI as a<br>statement as a policy and how do I<br>integrate that into our business<br>development and into the infrastructure<br>of our company when we are all Mai we<br>are all Pacifica and this is how we this<br>is how we naturally live and see the<br>world in the first place and we<br>acknowledge<br>the of like wherever we go<br>and to try force that with inside a<br>business infrastructure of policies and<br>statements and things like that just<br>seem so unnatural completely unnatural<br>which gets to a point where we don't we<br>don't think that's probably the most<br>valuable way of doing<br>that um and then it's<br>also from both that cultural and<br>professional perspective is where the<br>tension lies and I believe this is where<br>tension for a lot of us<br>pacif and people see our positioning in<br>tit so I think most constructive thing<br>that came out of a conversation with my<br>partner was well how do you take<br>thousands of years of<br>relationality and understanding of Our<br>World Views and the sense of<br>collectivism across<br>towa and how do we articulate that now<br>in today's context in M World cuz for a<br>very long time and just acknowledging<br>what both<br>and Jade had mentioned was you know the<br>last five decades there been a like<br>there been an absolute disconnection<br>from a policymaking perspective from a<br>social perspective cultural perspective<br>but it's only largely here in Al and and<br>that's no no fault of of anyone in this<br>room can sit here and talk about the<br>government but I don't think that's<br>constructive anyway we I was getting to<br>was it feels like we're at a time now we<br>you can start developing what those<br>Frameworks and processes look like from<br>a cultural perspective<br>between one and<br>Pacifica and how that then translate<br>across the The Wider architectural<br>industry for us we can control that and<br>we can influence that and if anything we<br>can be somewhat of a leader across other<br>Industries across Al and what does that<br>relationality look like from a<br>professional perspective which uplifts<br>and fak Mana our our cultural worldviews<br>if that makes sense so yeah I think it's<br>the time we're at a healthy time and<br>we're at a very privileged time to do<br>that and I don't I don't think we should<br>opportunity yeah this was um like I saw<br>that question was like oh man I know how<br>to answer this one um but I thought I<br>thought about my um my kids<br>grandchildren great<br>grandchildren um what who will they<br>identify with if they stay here um their<br>ties with Tonga for example will<br>slowly get weaker and weaker as you know<br>the suddenly they got fourth or fifth<br>cousins um it becomes different and it's<br>like um what system would I think they<br>should grow up with in and I think the<br>um<br>the<br>indigenous systems are a lot more<br>resilient and tested with time for for<br>their safety for their to grow up um<br>especially in in this kind of global um<br>world we liveing where this there like<br>storms heading us all the time you know<br>so who builds the strongest<br>houses um and yeah I would say that<br>indigenous have a much better chance of<br>did<br>um some<br>really important points that you guys<br>have made<br>um and I'm just scribing down and I keep<br>underlining why now<br>um I know before SP<br>this um you know and to we talked about<br>I'm I'm in the same space as you how do<br>we how do we advance<br>us without kind of getting overburdened<br>or having a sense of responsibility that<br>after people<br>this I have a sense of guilt as well um<br>and we've got other question<br>are coming up so for and I being Pacific<br>peoples in who are not considered<br>indigenous person the land in Al but on<br>the other hand considered an ancestor<br>when older sibling or two at the same<br>time can be a conflicting space inh when<br>practicing<br>architecture when do we as specific<br>design as an I lead and when do we step<br>aside but this is really a question for<br>all of us who are not<br>def at this question will go to the<br>question oh my<br>gosh Merry Christmas I mean who should<br>carry out the digitalization of design<br>and placing in our and how should others<br>Al is it a break time here can I get<br>another glass of wine um W<br>yeah the other part<br>of<br>the the the tensions or maybe<br>experiences that um my partner and I are<br>having because you know I remember<br>asking her about TI and what should I<br>say today and she was like oh you should<br>give them a history lesson you know<br>right from to like TI to like MIM and<br>the work want to check I'm like wow<br>okay know to is right yeah but um you<br>know and I think in that conversation<br>was just acknowledging the work and<br>whether it be fortunately or<br>unfortunately but just the work that<br>Tanga have done to get to this position<br>and being able to lead these<br>conversations<br>again<br>and you know when you know just<br>conversations around<br>and our positioning in in today's<br>landscape or in the landscape of<br>Al culturally for me I think there's a<br>couple of shifts I think I I'll speak to<br>the first shift maybe before I met PA<br>was you know I felt like there was like<br>a entitlement is the wrong word but just<br>this maybe f is is the right<br>word but you like graduating from<br>University on this High moving into this<br>professional<br>space um and always feeling the need to<br>want to be in front of the room because<br>maybe the Pacifica voice isn't being<br>heard and or maybe there was just<br>another part of me just wanting to be in<br>front of the room<br>but maybe you up but um and then really<br>my because again going back to the<br>conversation that I had but culturally<br>always understanding my relation my<br>relationship<br>with uh Tonga and that was something<br>that was just Jing to me when we were<br>when we were young and you know we were<br>born into the PPC Newton and they s u<br>and K had a very strong relationship<br>with t Tonga and a lot of my older<br>siblings grew up in the days like the D<br>raids and the Polynesian Panthers and at<br>that point in time in Collective<br>hardship that collectivism was their<br>strongest point M so around that time<br>there was a very strong s of sense of<br>collective<br>identity and around the times of Bastian<br>point and so a lot of these things<br>happening which you know four or five<br>decades later we don't really have that<br>strong strong Collective understanding<br>then then going into this process myself<br>while I feel like my my greatest<br>understanding of M and TI and these<br>understandings of the hardships of T in<br>this day age was actually during my time<br>over inat and that was where I met PA<br>me no it was and and then just learning<br>just i' had to<br>unlearn after that and going through<br>this process of studying architecture<br>and this perception that the architect<br>needed to be in front of the room needed<br>to be the one holding the pencil needed<br>to be the one illustrating the nice<br>pictures needed to be the one telling<br>the vision again this is the bable at<br>the very least that's that's how I saw<br>it all and then going over to e mar and<br>just and learning all of that and really<br>was where I had my greatest strongest<br>sense of being s and my RO with inside<br>the pap and ha really needed to<br>translate to me professionally and<br>needed to translate into most studio and<br>so what that looks like<br>is I believe our role as professionally<br>as Architects but also our role is<br>Pacific is really to uplift the manner<br>of T and in whichever way they see that<br>and that's nonnegotiable from a cultural<br>perspective and also in in seeing out<br>the of TI actually stood for an 1840<br>person so I don't see as specific in the<br>front of the room unless that<br>conversation with man has happened if<br>they want us to be in front of the room<br>that can<br>happen uh but I saw the biggest shift in<br>me was no longer wanting to be in front<br>of the room but to be supporting my<br>partner and and her Farm or alha know<br>and seeing out their Visions for their F<br>and if we can translate that<br>professionally and everything every<br>single office that we sit in today then<br>Al will be a completely different place<br>in 5 years from<br>now I just want to that to our as well<br>how should we be a good<br>Ally<br>LIF um I think a good example of of<br>being a good Ally is um you know the you<br>know your project at Glen primary school<br>you know where you were asked to um to<br>design and build a<br>f um but but understood that um what was<br>first appropriate was to get the<br>blessing of of mana<br>kak and I<br>think um that requires some sensitivity<br>and it requires relationships as well<br>and I think um that's something that um<br>Albert referred to earlier was um the<br>strength of the relationships that you<br>build over time and and effectively The<br>credibility that you build as someone<br>who is honoring you know honoring of<br>those relationships so I think um the to<br>be a good Ally is to have good<br>relationships um and through your good<br>relationships you will have good<br>cultural sensitivity and understanding<br>of<br>histories and um and once you have have<br>that<br>groundwork um in place then then you can<br>confidently Place yourself in<br>relationship to those people<br>and and neither party feels that either<br>is overstepping the mark people know<br>each other they know um where they stand<br>and they know that there's a time to<br>support and there's a time to<br>leave and um so I think that's um I<br>guess a very simple observation around<br>being a good Ally and I extend that not<br>just<br>to to to par in particular it's the same<br>um same conversation I had with park at<br>parties and my first conversation is<br>where are you<br>from and they go where am I from um<br>where do you feel most connected to<br>um well you know got was placed in the<br>cor mandal and um our family have had it<br>for three generations and um I guess if<br>I had to be pushed that's the place I<br>feel most connected to and and then our<br>next question is what's your<br>relationship with Mona<br>in in in in that particular area do you<br>know um how your family got to have that<br>land and<br>how do not have that land and so on so<br>this is the process of of what I call<br>becoming indigenous it is to be deepen<br>your connections to the people uh deep<br>and if you deepen your connections to<br>the people of the land then you can<br>become an ally in looking after the land<br>and it needs a lot of looking after<br>we've got a um a giant U down here that<br>that was discussed earlier there's<br>there's an enormous sinkhole that that<br>here is on behalf<br>of is is monitoring um you know these<br>are these are issues that we need<br>everyone involved in um and um because<br>you know we we've all got to the Allies<br>to Pap<br>and um and we can do that best if we've<br>relationships I might reframe my answer<br>in terms of some of the other roles I've<br>hold in my life<br>um this is a bit of a word jumble but I<br>I'm the co-director of the indigenous<br>people's work program for the<br>international Union of Architects there<br>we go um which is um um the<br>international Union of Architects is<br>like un for architecture it was<br>established in France it's a very Europe<br>Centric thing um and last year I was<br>approached by a very good friend of ours<br>Patrick Stewart another indigenous<br>architect from uh killer whale clan in<br>um Turtle Island more than S<br>Canada um to join him to sit alongside<br>him in the role of<br>co-director um because of the as was<br>describing the established relationships<br>had between um and our Mar practitioners<br>here in altero and quite a lot of um<br>practitioners across Turtle Island um<br>broadly so both Canada and um the US so<br>I'm not there just because I like um<br>acronyms but I I was there because I was<br>asked and that puts me back in this<br>position of lisip in a really<br>interesting way because here I I<br>am and I can speak to my experience and<br>what my f are experiencing my hu my ewi<br>I can work with other ewi and Hau to use<br>my work experience to support them to<br>get better outcomes and now I'm finding<br>myself in global dialogues having those<br>discussions as well and a lot of them<br>again to to reinforce what I was<br>speaking to is coming about through<br>relationships I found myself in this<br>really weird situation where I was being<br>asked by the city of La to help them<br>with a policy they were writing about<br>land<br>acknowledgements literally the entire<br>policy started with we want to<br>acknowledge that there are indigenous<br>people in LA and that was kind of it um<br>but 3 years previous their mayor had<br>actively said they didn't have<br>indigenous people so I found myself in a<br>zoom call with all these people talking<br>about G and what people like Phil had<br>been doing what open Council had been<br>doing so in that role what I do as an<br>ally is I use my experience to<br>illustrate ways we have gone about<br>having these conversations to illustrate<br>the kinds of aspirations they might want<br>to have for themselves and to illustrate<br>the kinds of pressures we've put on our<br>nonmi entities um<br>organizations councils to me m to say<br>with actually we've we've managed to do<br>this now we have some different<br>mechanisms to hand for us things like TI<br>or white tongy that give us levers to<br>pull from but you can still use some of<br>these examples to help you and I<br>basically just gave them some Clues sent<br>them some websites had a discussion with<br>them this was the weird La time walk I<br>was in um and they went great and then I<br>got out of the way so for me at that<br>point it was being able to go I have had<br>X number of years of experience I finds<br>in this position all the time and know<br>Albert you know we we all actually are<br>often so I've used my experience as a m<br>in the job that I have to help actually<br>quite a number of different indigenous<br>cordal but it's never my place to hold<br>or push or um then be the center of that<br>discussion so for me it's been about<br>using the experience the word you used I<br>think before was entitlement though I<br>think you know it what you've got to<br>draw from is and like Albert um a<br>beautiful privilege of you know knowing<br>that you had your F you're not fighting<br>to get it back but then there are other<br>things you can do from that position so<br>what would you use to support Mari with<br>that in mind I I think that that would<br>be what it is and when we as Marty<br>travel overseas everybody looks at us<br>like the rich cousins<br>from the city because for indigenous<br>people we fundamentally we are we're the<br>ones that have a lot<br>of uh rights relative to other<br>indigenous people we we're the ones that<br>have a lot of um you know practitioners<br>relative to other indigenous peoples we<br>don't have heaps but our relativity<br>globally means that the allyship we<br>actually have to have in our Global<br>indigenous Community um has been quite<br>interestingly Illustrated to me over the<br>last few years so I suppose I've been<br>able to put myself in the shoes of Paka<br>and tangana and others practicing here<br>in Alor because I've been asked to sort<br>of make similar commentary in Australia<br>and and overseas um and that's been a<br>kind of fascinating<br>space I'm just going to add a little<br>something um yeah so something I often<br>use to kind of relate to Kaka trying to<br>navigate their position it and<br>relationality is the fact that I did<br>grow up in Australia as I mentioned<br>before and I had to interrogate myself<br>around kind of where do I sit what's my<br>relationship to the land what is my role<br>um I never practiced there I just went<br>to architecture school there but um like<br>charmain I also went to the University<br>of Queensland and um I was really<br>inspired by the abigal environments<br>Research Center that was part of our<br>department but didn't sort of filter<br>into the undergraduate teaching and I<br>was just a scared teenager so I didn't<br>actually T them but I listened to their<br>lectures and I kind of heard the work<br>that was going on there and I was really<br>intensely interested in this idea of<br>culturally uh fitful purpose housing for<br>indigenous people but also led by or at<br>least co-led by indigenous people and I<br>found myself really in intensely<br>interested in that work but I had to<br>question myself and think well okay why<br>is this interesting to me and of course<br>it was my own Mari culture and faka and<br>my desire desire to connect with that<br>and then I felt that I had a fork in the<br>road I had two choices one I could say<br>look I'm going to stay in Australia and<br>I'm going to commit myself to working in<br>this space as an ally and a supporter<br>for indigenous people and fully get<br>behind them and do the learning that I<br>need to do to be able to do that well or<br>I'm just going to go back home to my own<br>people and figure out who I am and so um<br>you know I've told the story a lot so<br>you know I was a big part of that<br>journey I didn't know any Marty<br>Architects until Auntie was like oh I<br>was in my second year maybe she's like<br>oh um I must introduce you to Al he's a<br>he's a mar architect he's doing the<br>things you want to do you know like many<br>of us didn't have any Professionals in<br>the family didn't know any of these<br>people didn't even know that there was<br>Marty Architects so that was just you<br>know another level again and then the<br>whole world opened up because I started<br>meeting everyone and we had this<br>incredible Community but the point of<br>that discussion was just that I have<br>been in that same position of going who<br>am I what's my positionality and what<br>does that mean in terms of my role and<br>it's a really healthy thing to do and<br>actually to keep doing regardless cuz<br>that'll shift depending on where you're<br>working where you're operating and I<br>think of that even on a like a tribal or<br>a regional level so I don't just go oh<br>yeah of course someone invited me to go<br>to to wonu and that sounds cool and I<br>must be brilliant so I'm the right<br>person for the job I will ask myself am<br>I the right person for the job and I'll<br>also question the potential client I'm<br>like okay do you know you have got<br>Architects do you know their names if<br>you don't I'll introduce you oh okay and<br>sometimes they say yep cool we all know<br>that but we want you for a specific<br>reason and I'll go okay cool I can<br>accept that but then do have students or<br>young people coming through so that I<br>don't have I you know I want I value<br>this relationship but really I want to<br>be supporting your H not me coming in as<br>an outsider who doesn't have any po<br>here and yeah sure you go back far<br>enough you can usually find some but<br>what I'm saying is that's a healthy<br>thing to do whoever you are wherever<br>you're going question if you're the<br>right person I like to think think of it<br>as like a healthy insecurity don't be<br>too confident that you're always the<br>best and the right person cuz you might<br>not be and that's so<br>fun just just one sorry would you like<br>to speak to I was just going to take<br>that segue because our next questiona be<br>our last now before we hand it over to<br>anyone in the audience if they have<br>question you could to this too um got it<br>now it's about cultural<br>specificity<br>deep knowledge of a people their place<br>and their ways and their values and Jake<br>perfect segue to this it's becoming more<br>relevant right when designing with<br>indigenous communities meaning one knows<br>their limits with cultural<br>knowledge and with<br>humility accepts that the actual<br>knowledge holders outside of the design<br>team right Beyond The Architects beyond<br>the designers the knowledge reside<br>within the community they are the<br>culture<br>experts the<br>hours the first in this room goes deeper<br>than saying get a m pafic person on the<br>project but instead ask the<br>question uh so any fur thoughts around<br>that andt anything else want add<br>last okay I'll start from the uh<br>indigenous question first to get to the<br>the<br>the community<br>knowledge<br>so I thought it was important to talk<br>about the question that Lama asked about<br>the indigenizing design what that means<br>and it's because I think a lot of the<br>work that I'm doing and with ro and uh<br>Anda people I'm working<br>with uh we're kind of in the middle of<br>indigenizing design and what that means<br>and that's really important because one<br>of the important things about that is<br>it's not an isolated moment where we<br>suddenly kind of indigenize the<br>knowledge I think it's got to come in a<br>kind of a more holistic approach from<br>the position of why do we need<br>indigenize the knowledge well we have to<br>acknowledge the the violence and the<br>trauma that the colonial<br>imposition that happened<br>and the process that happened to re to<br>build some sort of<br>reconciliation with people of the land<br>here and a lot of the other indigenous<br>community in the world to build a a<br>relationship to reconciliate to<br>acknowledge the the violence and the<br>harm that's been caused over the last<br>200 years a lot of those<br>communities and and then the reparation<br>that comes from there the return of land<br>the acknowledgement of the uh<br>destruction of sacred places uh sacred<br>temples we have that so many in the<br>Pacific and then the the the process for<br>indigenization then can happen and of<br>course I think it's important that<br>indigenization process is done by uh<br>people the indigenous people of the<br>knowledge and what's really important in<br>that project now we've come to realize<br>is that um that if we if we as<br>indigenous people become competent in<br>our own knowledge in our own<br>real<br>language then there's a moment there and<br>I think some of us here have uh<br>experienced that when you confront other<br>people if not in the Pacific will be<br>North America or in Australia where you<br>start to kind uh compare your knowledge<br>you know what is your word for space<br>what is your word for water so rather<br>than routing your your discursive or<br>your your your discourse through the<br>language of the Masters or the colonial<br>Masters you actually compare item item<br>through your own language your buildings<br>elements of building through you know<br>the front the back the size of the<br>building because they carry so much<br>different uh elements that the the the<br>kind of translations into English or<br>other European language and then back to<br>the indigenous language you go through<br>such a process that you lose so much so<br>on that level it's really important for<br>indigenous for design for us for project<br>that we're doing so we can go to<br>Australia we can go to North America we<br>can talk Among Us in the Pacific we we<br>have a genealogy that's connected where<br>we compare and talk about these things<br>and why architecture has moved so slowly<br>in terms of invention from the palangi<br>um architecture so I think that's that<br>the process of indigenization is<br>important and I think most of us are<br>working in that space and the holistic<br>view of that is that reconciliation<br>reparation indigenization of the<br>knowledge and the last part that a lot<br>of us now I mean the thing that's kind<br>of in here but no one talks about at the<br>moment is decolonization<br>what what is decolonization if we've<br>gone through this process and one of the<br>things that really important now for the<br>work that we're doing is that after<br>doing all this<br>work you can't put decolonization back<br>on us and I think it's a shared process<br>between indigenous people and the uh the<br>people who did the harm and the trauma<br>and and the knowledge bases that carry<br>with that and what I think is important<br>in that decolonization process<br>is that you make sure you put in place<br>uh thing you know laws whatever you<br>might call it so that the trauma is not<br>people are not ret traumatized but also<br>those violence can't happen in the<br>future so so you can build a different<br>worlds and I think that's a that's a<br>collective process it can't be just<br>indigenous people it's all other people<br>who are part of the<br>process now I I I look over there<br>there's M um do some work with us<br>there's also process of De coloniality<br>but I'll to talk about that which I<br>think it's a really important shift in<br>the discourse at least the decoloniality<br>is the process where<br>naming and also looking at you know what<br>we call<br>song or or even the word indigenous is<br>in fact already a a process of modernity<br>that's<br>imparted to us um and so there are<br>different processes and strategies that<br>you have to go through that so to go<br>back to your then your question about<br>what was the last question cultural<br>specificity and even among indigenous<br>people's on projects right we may not<br>know the T we may not know the personal<br>intimate value so ask the question who<br>else could do this better or sounds good<br>I'll pass it on to the other cuz they're<br>probably more<br>qualified<br>um I was trying to think about examples<br>for me this might sound a bit like a<br>paradox but I'm I guess that's the way<br>my brain is working at the moment the<br>deeper I go into my own understanding of<br>then and all of those layers so the more<br>specific I<br>get the wider my understanding of Tim<br>and becomes um this is a random example<br>buto many years ago I remember um he me<br>Titan I'm so sorry if you ever watched<br>this I'm bastardizing your cord it all<br>but was talking about the process of um<br>coming onto a um for him as a so quite<br>specific to him and his e and he talked<br>about how the first you know the wave of<br>man coming on to the ARA was actually um<br>not just the domain of Tuma which most<br>people assume the artia is the domain of<br>but actually K one brings youan washes<br>on the mani and steps back he he sort of<br>talked about it in that respect and it<br>was a part of a wi accorded or of also<br>trying to decolonize our own<br>understanding of the atwa because so<br>many people only think about them the at<br>as being male and he was trying to<br>explain that from their perspective<br>there were 140 ATA 70 male 70 female was<br>all IM balance so he was talking about<br>different female ATA and their roles and<br>so he was explaining this one moment<br>right thinking about hinana um as the<br>ATA of the kind of top current of the<br>ocean bringing in us as man and coming<br>back that's a very very very simplified<br>version of the supp but but I go back to<br>being in havai surrounded by these guys<br>listening to um AOL and ala and others<br>talking about the idea that the the<br>marai the clear space the marai ARA<br>might have actually come from this idea<br>of um The Space Between the island and<br>the outer ATL and that actually there's<br>a sort of there's a gap in the atle<br>where you as a visitor the Mani might be<br>coming in through that Gap you being<br>brought in and that is your first<br>relational exchange literally the ocean<br>bringing you in and I'm going ah of<br>connecting to this cord I'd heard from<br>Papa H 12 years ago about TI in a very<br>specific way related to a very specific<br>City we were having up north and going I<br>it just sounds like these guys are<br>talking about an old Tia that related to<br>the ocean literally the top current<br>bringing in<br>this walker to be greeted by the people<br>truly of that island is part of that t<br>that's the exchange so I think about<br>that all the time is that the deeper I<br>get which I need to do for me not for<br>projects not for architecture just for<br>life actually is helping me to<br>understand our connection our genealogy<br>literally our back to how and why<br>we've established all those things I<br>remember listening to the talk priest<br>that used to speak to my n and when I am<br>down and kite of her territory they feel<br>like they're speaking talk loud to me<br>there's aspects of the the the heavy<br>kiss sound to me sounds a lot like toan<br>being spoken or at least the priest I<br>remember in my mind you know there are<br>all these funny relationships I think<br>about that specificity is an incredibly<br>important thing cuz I think it's giving<br>us back our monal to hucky our sense of<br>self but I also find for me anyway in my<br>research that it's giving me a great<br>connection to everyone else well thank<br>you we're going to end that question<br>there<br>to yeah um we're just mindful of the<br>time<br>about I mean we can sit here and chat<br>about this all night and I've got a lot<br>of questions of sh however we' got to<br>move on I just want to open it out to<br>the floor if anybody has a question for<br>our<br>panelist um please raise your hand I'll<br>bring<br>the not I've got a question for pan<br>there wow so polite okay wow okay<br>question it's an open question what<br>priorities I did give you guys a<br>chance what what should our next elect<br>the government's top priorities be for<br>housing M and Pacific communities one<br>perfect give us more<br>money give us the money and step out of<br>the way I think that was the theme of<br>The Last housing conference wasn't it<br>and I believe if there's a Pacifica<br>housing conference one day that should<br>be the same thing yeah so that's yeah<br>one<br>sentence should i s<br>now I think just um Innovation um and<br>almost like designing from the ground up<br>here um economically communities family<br>how long how long do people live um<br>things um I guess one sentence um Amal<br>Housing Authority is one of them and and<br>perhaps a Pacifica Housing Authority as<br>well we do need end to end um um support<br>for for housing the current government<br>has only just begun to spend what they<br>were spending in M housing in the 1980s<br>so we really just returned to that level<br>of investment uh at that time in<br>equivalency terms um whatever the next<br>government does it cannot spend less<br>K I would like housing to not be seen as<br>um just building houses um I have spent<br>a lot of conversations recently thinking<br>about uh the fact that the housing<br>discussion and health discussion need to<br>be the same conversation um because when<br>I'm talking too about youth offenders<br>you everybody's favorite um buzzword of<br>ram raids these days it's because um we<br>don't have you know stable housing<br>stable food source good education all<br>the things that actually give our kids<br>um a sense of place so yes those housing<br>authorities need to exist but it needs<br>to um be Beyond just<br>WS that's our<br>political text a h out of those people<br>who buy more<br>the
