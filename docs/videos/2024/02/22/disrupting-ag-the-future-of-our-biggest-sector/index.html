accurate.</p><p>good morning everyone I'm uh delighted<br>to introduce our first panel of our 2024<br>economics<br>Forum our first um topic is disrupting<br>agriculture the future of our biggest<br>sector we've got three expert panelists<br>joining me up here who have very rich<br>experience across a wide range of areas<br>that we'll be able to draw on during<br>this panel discussion uh we'll start<br>with five minutes of intro remarks from<br>each of our panelists our first panelist<br>will be Lan Jaga director of tuno fukari<br>Nui uh our second speaker is Professor<br>hajer Singh of Massie University and our<br>third speaker will be Wayne mcne chief<br>executive of Agri Z sorry Agri Z<br>NZ<br>after the five minutes of intro remarks<br>we're wide open for<br>discussion please remember Matt's uh<br>comments about slido uh you've got the<br>slido if you're online some of you are<br>viewing the live stream if you're if<br>you're viewing the live stream you've<br>got a link on the website if you're in<br>the room you've got your scan box there<br>when you are submitting your questions<br>if you could please note the SE the<br>session or in particular the name of the<br>person you would like that question<br>directed at that would be a big help to<br>our team that's uh supporting us in<br>making sure these questions come through<br>appropriately so with that um I'd like<br>to introduce our three expert speakers<br>and uh start with Lane if you'd like to<br>you K good morning I've got six ideas in<br>five<br>minutes first idea idea we confront<br>Global<br>headwinds it's important to recognize<br>it's a really tough time to be in<br>government putting aside the issues<br>specific to each to to the success of<br>Coalition governments the underlying<br>cause of the malays is the global<br>environment we are operating in that's<br>about demographics climate change rapid<br>technological change high debt levels<br>economic inequality geopolitical and<br>trade disruption and increasingly vocal<br>segments of our populations and Western<br>democracies that are reacting to their<br>falling standard of<br>living second idea these headwinds have<br>a New Zealand face in New Zealand these<br>Global headwinds crystallize into<br>increasingly unaffordable housing for<br>the working class health and health and<br>education systems under significant and<br>increasing pressure concerning levels of<br>Youth anxiety and poor educational<br>performance roading and Water Management<br>infrastructure requiring very<br>significant<br>investment and very significant<br>investment required to decarbonize the<br>economy all against a backdrop of<br>economic fragility and increasing<br>geopolitical tensions<br>globally the impact of these<br>headwinds impact our Animal Spirits as<br>there is a growing sense that the<br>country is going backwards and the<br>working class are struggling to make<br>ends<br>meet third<br>idea despite these challenges it is<br>possible to characterize what success<br>looks like at a high level we can desum<br>a list of primary Musto economic and<br>environmental objectives we must<br>maintain economic growth at her above 2%<br>annually we must maintain export growth<br>we must reduce gross emissions we must<br>double renewable electricity Supply with<br>supporting transmission we must continue<br>to increase investment in health and<br>education fourth idea while it's<br>relatively straightforward to<br>characterize high level objectives<br>successful implementation will be both<br>challenging and complex to achieve this<br>will require complex<br>and a complex and intersecting number of<br>secondary objectives including but not<br>limited to increasing investment in in<br>R&amp;D which Professor sing will touch on<br>in his remarks today supporting<br>productivity growth supporting uh the<br>growth of uh new export sectors<br>decarbonizing Dairy reviewing GE<br>regulations and enabling very<br>significant investment in and<br>development of<br>infrastructure fifth idea<br>a purely neoliberal economic<br>prescription will not<br>suffice governments around the world are<br>confronting similar challenges and are<br>responding with Pro with the proactive<br>application of industrial policy<br>industrial policy in New Zealand has a<br>poor reputation following following our<br>experience with the think big policies<br>in the<br>1980s despite this two area two areas<br>stand out for the application of<br>industrial policy in modern New Zealand<br>first to decarbonize we need to<br>Electrify and this will require doubling<br>renewable electricity production in New<br>Zealand how this is done is critical the<br>cost of electricity will be fundamental<br>to our future export competitiveness and<br>standard of living the application of<br>proactive industrial policy in the<br>energy sector is not radical thinking<br>it's crucial infrastructure investment<br>that is the that will be the foundation<br>to our future economic and social<br>well-being secondly we need to invest in<br>the continued growth of the food and<br>fiber sector while at the same time<br>decarbonizing the sector for instance<br>through the methane partnership which<br>Wayne will touch on<br>shortly sixth idea proactive industrial<br>policy for the food and fiber sector is<br>important as part of the broader<br>transition this National Le coalition<br>government has an objective to double<br>the export the value of exports within<br>the next 10 years this ambitious goal<br>encompasses not only Agriculture and<br>Forestry but also Services International<br>Education technology and tourism this is<br>a laudable objective but it implies a<br>compound average growth rate of<br>7.2% and that will only be be achieved<br>if we continue to grow the food and<br>fiber sector which comprises 80% of<br>merchandise export<br>earnings the specific challenge is that<br>we are seeing and the unprecedented<br>rewiring of Global Food value chains<br>with four main drivers being climate<br>change technology consumer and Market<br>segmentation and<br>geopolitics the New Zealand food and<br>fiber sector Remains the backbone of the<br>New Zealand economy and strong strategic<br>actions and Investments are required if<br>we are to both decarbonize and to<br>continue to grow this important sector<br>thank<br>you thank you<br>K uh thank you for the opportunity to<br>participate in this<br>forum um I'm going to touch upon some of<br>the technology disrup itions major<br>disruption that can have a big impact on<br>the New Zealand primary sector we know<br>food is foundation of our economy but is<br>largely dominated by animal protein that<br>comes in the form of meat and dairy that<br>constitutes over 65% of the total food<br>exports we know that with the growing<br>population means more demand of<br>protein mainly meat and dairy but also<br>this demand will be driven by<br>understanding of role of protein in<br>human health that's all good news for<br>New Zealand in terms of more protein<br>more exports and more Dairy and meat but<br>at the same time we know that the<br>traditional Dairy systems especially<br>animal agriculture face major challenges<br>as Lane pointed out climate change<br>resources water land use and growing<br>number of consumers concerned about<br>sustainability and Animal<br>Welfare in response to these challenges<br>what's happening globally we are seeing<br>major disruptive Technologies uh<br>beginning to emerge so-called<br>alternative protein technology that<br>means trying to make protein or find<br>protein outside the dairy and meat<br>sector there many Technologies as you<br>have seen yourself plant-based proteins<br>um from different sources then they are<br>restructured into uh different kind of<br>burgers and and dairy proteins and oat<br>milks and impossible burgers that growth<br>is phenomenal and um I think it's about<br>30% we've seen growth in that space But<br>even more disruptive uh being able to<br>grow meat in a lab the so-called<br>cultured Meats so cultivating cells from<br>animals and creating meat without the<br>need of animals and then there's a<br>procedure fermentation where microbes<br>can produce milk protein through through<br>genetically modified<br>microorganisms further down the line and<br>New Frontier is plant molecular farming<br>where actually plants can grow animal<br>protein so we can actually genetically<br>modify the plants to produce um milk egg<br>and meat proteins so this is quite a<br>game-changing technology that emerging<br>extremely fast there are many technical<br>barriers to overcome before these become<br>mainstream probably 30 40 years<br>away uh but over time the progress is<br>rapid around the world and there's a<br>massive investments from the private<br>sector especially in the US and Europe<br>in those new technologies so the<br>challenges would be things like um um<br>price parity scaling of facilities<br>consumer acceptance regulator is a big<br>one environmental regulations and food<br>regulations around on those Technologies<br>so now the question remains what should<br>New Zealand do how should we deal with<br>this um major Trend technology Trend<br>that's likely to potentially could<br>impact New Zealand<br>agriculture so we can't just simply wait<br>for this destruction to occur we need to<br>I believe that we need to actively<br>participate this in food Revolution<br>potentially developing our own<br>capabilities skills International<br>Investments Partnerships uh in this<br>space so alterntive proteins will never<br>completely replace animal Foods I think<br>they because the greater demand of<br>protein around the world they'll never<br>go away but I think the and opportunity<br>so we can be both so in that case we<br>that will diversify our food exports so<br>we can these alternative proteins<br>technologies will cater for broader<br>consumer base with different dietary<br>requirement that actually open up a<br>whole new you know Innovations um<br>potentially for the New Zealand sector<br>side by side based on high quality<br>environmentally friendly uh offerings<br>both the high-tech traditional foods and<br>these high-tech Foods this will<br>require much more investments into R&amp;D<br>startups uh infrastructure being talked<br>about this morning and the um and of<br>course this whole ecosystem had to be<br>supported through right kind of policies<br>regulations to<br>incentivize this tor to coexist with the<br>um with our traditional produce this is<br>also unique space for high value IP<br>development and knowledge development<br>and there been talked about quite a lot<br>in the government the weightless exports<br>so this is I think is a as a field where<br>lot happening at the moment so some of<br>these Technologies rely on genetic<br>engineering and that means we need to<br>look at carefully look at our<br>regulations on Gene editing and GM foods<br>and with all this we we will be uh left<br>behind in development of these<br>Technologies and that would require<br>consumer acceptance of new technologies<br>and also public education and campaigns<br>and so on so GM technology of course<br>will have much wider implication not<br>just alternative protein sector but also<br>crop um production systems improved<br>nutrition better taste reduce need of<br>pesticides and so on this is a really<br>quite a crucial moment for GM<br>Technologies to be looked at again the<br>another technology that's come much more<br>widely coming through is the AI and<br>artificial intelligence then need to be<br>combined with the new thinking so we can<br>actually create much more Innovative<br>space uh moving forward to put our<br>industry at the front Forefront of uh<br>food exports thank you<br>very<br>much kuroto c um it's intentional that<br>lane went wide Professor sing went a bit<br>narrow and I'm going to go a lot<br>narrower again um so uh I'm Wayne mcne<br>I'm here today in my capacity as the<br>chief executive of Agri Z NZ and I will<br>focus my introductory remarks on the<br>risks and the opportunities sector faces<br>in the a of emissions from Remnant<br>animals however I am happy to talk<br>across a range of topics given my fairly<br>broad background in the public and<br>private sector and The primary sector<br>now according to the New Zealand<br>Ministry of the environment 50% of New<br>Zealand's emissions came from<br>agriculture in 2020 this gives New<br>Zealand a unique Challenge and a unique<br>opportunity agrez Enz is a private<br>public partnership created under the<br>last government but as we've heard<br>earlier will be very popular with this<br>government government too hopefully uh<br>we have seven founding shareholders um<br>six from the private sector and the<br>government who have committed $165<br>million over three and a half years to<br>accelerate the de development and<br>commercialization of emissions<br>reductions solutions for<br>Farmers new shareholders are about to<br>join as well to grow the fund and<br>private sector contributions are<br>Amplified by the government dollar for<br>dooll<br>match the founding shareholders are the<br>crown through MPI f Terra sinay anco<br>silver Fern Farms Ravenstone and rber<br>Bank together they have a deep<br>experience across the breadth of the<br>landscape and supply chain in the New<br>Zealand primary sector and access to<br>most of New Zealand's<br>Farmers the purpose of Agra zero was to<br>undertake targeted Investments and<br>actions to accelerate the development<br>commercialization and deployment of<br>effective and affordable solutions that<br>were used by New Zealand Farmers to<br>significantly reduce biogenic methane<br>and nitrous oxide emissions and we are<br>narrowly focused just those two sets of<br>emissions not so carbon not any of the<br>other things and I think that does um<br>help us in many ways to be very targeted<br>in our thinking emissions are a<br>disruptive risk and opportunity for our<br>farmers of sheep cattle and deer many of<br>our customers many of the customers of<br>our processes have seent ambitious<br>targets for scope 3 emissions for<br>example by 2030 scope 3 emission<br>reduction targets 30% for Denon cargle<br>General Mills coca Co Coca-Cola and<br>craft HS McDonald's has a target of 36%<br>reduction by 2030 nesle 50% reduction by<br>2030 Pepsi 40% sb's 50% and Tesco's 39%<br>of forest land and agriculture emissions<br>so you can see there's a massive<br>customer pull here uh and they are<br>putting big expectations on our sector<br>our processors and our Farmers to help<br>help them meet those<br>targets and they are real targets these<br>customers are serious they're actively<br>targeting reducing emissions and they're<br>making purchasing decisions to help them<br>Reach those targets they're clear that<br>New Zealand Farmers start with an<br>advantage we are a relatively low<br>emitting farming sector at the moment<br>for wool and for meat um however we<br>won't stay that way uh as there is a lot<br>of new technology coming in in other<br>markets so we need to be part of that<br>change as well<br>now some Farmers would say this is all a<br>lie that methane emissions are emissions<br>are not a problem and even even if they<br>are we are already very efficient and so<br>we shouldn't need to change our<br>practices they argue that using<br>different methodologies such as gwp star<br>they shouldn't need to reduce their<br>emissions now I'm not an expert in the<br>science but regardless of those<br>arguments governments internationally<br>consider methane from remant animals to<br>be a significant issue customers also<br>consider it to be a significant issue<br>and increase in inly so do consumers so<br>and aside from the customer risk there's<br>also a trade risk uh if we're not seen<br>to be taking action we could see non-t<br>barriers for some of our<br>products alternative plant we just heard<br>from Professor saying alternative<br>plant-based meats and milks are on are<br>taking up shelf space um and we need to<br>show that we are able to reduce<br>emissions as well cell-based plant-based<br>Etc are becoming increasingly<br>competitive so that's the bad news the<br>good news is in the area of emissions<br>reduction in ruminant animals is<br>attracting a lot of funding a lot of<br>international funding from philanthropic<br>funds like the GP Jeff beos Earth fund<br>The Gates Foundation the gram foundation<br>and private Equity investors like<br>Breakthrough energy and many others and<br>this investment is starting to pay<br>dividends there are products in<br>development from low methan genetics to<br>affluent treatments vaccines feed<br>additives nitrification Inhibitors three<br>KN probiotics various seaweeds and high<br>lipid grasses<br>and so you might say why do we need New<br>Zealand investment uh and involvement<br>well the answer to that is actually<br>simple most of the investment to date is<br>be for tools for farmers who are using<br>high intensitive high feeding systems be<br>it Dairy feed dairy or meat feed lot<br>systems in Europe the United States and<br>China things that need to be feed<br>continuously to an animal which will not<br>work in a New Zealand pastoral<br>system and New Zealand is a very small<br>Market although 75 % of the world's<br>farmed Remnant animals are pastoral uh<br>extensively grze mostly in Africa and<br>South America they're not high value<br>markets for companies that are<br>developing new technologies we are<br>focusing our investments on tools that<br>will work in a pastal farming system and<br>we seek agreements with the companies we<br>invest in to bring those tools to New<br>Zealand do the necessary research here<br>and get regulatory approval make their<br>products available to Farmers so uh<br>we're what you would call the Strategic<br>investor uh in these types of companies<br>so in summary there is a very real and<br>disruptive risk to our Dairy and meat<br>sectors from customers emission<br>reduction targets but there was also a<br>very real opportunity to stay among the<br>most efficient producers of dairy<br>P well I promised you we'd get some rich<br>insights and we certainly did from the<br>wealth of experience from our speakers<br>um here of course their bios are in<br>front of you as well if you want further<br>information about them um we really<br>covered the full spectrum including some<br>some wonderful links with the rest of<br>the sessions that we'll be having<br>through this forum so we can already<br>start to see these these links starting<br>to happen between between the sessions<br>uh and we covered the full the full sort<br>of uh Spectrum there so thank you very<br>much for those intro remarks I'm going<br>to um start with a question that I'll<br>address first to Ula and then I'll ask<br>waya a part of it and then we'll see hi<br>Jinder if you would like to add<br>something on there as well um Lan you<br>mentioned that the current national<br>government has this aim of doubling food<br>and fiber exports in in the next 10<br>years ambitious um do you think it's<br>achievable are there any policy settings<br>that could achieve that and then Wayne<br>I'd like you to comment particularly on<br>do we want to achieve this or are the<br>environmental consequences too great<br>soain okay so um first of all uh let me<br>say that from a New Zealand Inc<br>perspective a national um uh a national<br>good perspective that objective is uh<br>absolutely appropriate and important for<br>New Zealand because of the headwinds we<br>Face we simply must continue to grow<br>exports um to be able to support the<br>standard of living uh that we all aspire<br>to it's not an unreasonable objective if<br>you want to defend it you say well<br>actually we did that over the last 10<br>years uh we were able to uh to double<br>exports and so that's at a headline<br>basis it doesn't seem that unreasonable<br>but actually it's harder um and it's<br>harder because of what's happening in<br>the global environment although I would<br>just pause to say that the impacts of of<br>climate change uh on food production<br>systems globally actually will probably<br>be quite good um for the demand for New<br>Zealand food it's sort of a a sort of a<br>dark silver lining if you want to if you<br>want to put it that way so the demand<br>side looks reasonably strong the supply<br>side though um is Pretty Tough so when<br>you look at the New Zealand food<br>production system you're talking about<br>seven big verticals Dairy meat apples<br>kiwi fruit Etc uh when we go and we look<br>at the growth rates being achieved<br>across those seven big vertical what we<br>can see is the growth coming off uh and<br>so in it you know it is harder for our<br>current sectors to grow the implication<br>of that is is that we need to protect<br>our current sectors we need to enhance<br>their ability to continue uh to do well<br>for instance through the work that uh<br>Agri zero is doing and Wayne is uh is is<br>leading um and and importantly it is<br>critical that we develop new export<br>sectors in the food and fiber sector so<br>the blue economy is languishing it's<br>$600 million Norway is1 18 billion uh<br>and so there is a massive opportunity in<br>that space there's a massive opportunity<br>in the health and wellness space and<br>that's why this idea of industrial<br>policy is so important because that<br>growth will not be achieved unless we<br>are absolutely Mission focused<br>absolutely creating alignment through<br>the system regulation and investment and<br>driving forward to continue to grow<br>those new opportunities thanks L and<br>perhaps we'll come back to picking<br>winners a little bit later yeah thanks<br>well I think it's a great idea and I<br>would think that because when I was<br>director general of MP we developed a<br>goal to double the value of primary<br>sector exports uh by 2025 which we put<br>in place in 2012 and actually not too<br>far away from it by 2025 as it happens<br>so great idea um the challenge is how do<br>you make it happen given the tools that<br>are available in the sector and to<br>government and there are some things<br>government can do it can reduce<br>regulatory barriers um it can it can<br>incentive devis look using industrial<br>policy in in the right places uh but<br>it's about value not volume so you come<br>back to the environment piece I mean<br>that's kind of the key isn't it so we<br>just don't have the space to grow more<br>and more and more of everything um so we<br>need and we've been working on this<br>obviously for a long time trying to look<br>at areas where we can raise that value<br>um and we have been we have been raising<br>the<br>value apparently I need a different<br>microphone uh yeah we have been raising<br>the value of our primary sector um<br>products over time and we just need to<br>continue to do that but it really needs<br>focused support from government uh and<br>in the end it has to be the industry<br>itself that leads it because it is the<br>people that are growing the people that<br>are processing the people that are<br>selling who will actually do it thanks<br>how jenda can I turn to you but can I<br>sort of add in this issue um you know<br>what's the current makeup of food and F<br>exports and how do you expect them to<br>change over the next 10 10 years in your<br>um comments you talked about a lot of<br>these new technologies a lot of the new<br>products<br>how would you see them changing in the<br>um in the next 10 years and there are<br>things in particular we need to do to<br>invest to support that<br>change yeah I I I think obviously it's<br>all driven by population growth so the<br>the you know the<br>population expected to reach 9 and a<br>half billion by 2050 so and of course um<br>you know the the the proportion of<br>growth is going to be largely in in Asia<br>and Africa to some extent and the and<br>the disposable income Rising around the<br>world so so in a sense the demand for<br>high higher quality protein higher<br>quality food U is going up uh it is<br>bound to go up and opportunities for New<br>Zealand are immense um in in fact I may<br>have made the point that the other<br>Technologies are there but reality is<br>that the growth of animal protein is<br>it's growing it will grow a bit further<br>but the cake is getting bigger so it's a<br>question of how we uh the other part of<br>the cake might be that will be more<br>options for um diets that are produced<br>differently um through the neurot<br>technology that may be more<br>plant-based uh so so how we take that<br>opportunity as well so that that come to<br>the<br>diversification portfolios what else we<br>can do in addition to what we are good<br>at so I think so I'm not denying the<br>opportunity that men the growth is going<br>to be always there thank you thanks<br>Wayne can we come back to to you on this<br>issue of the high margin you talked<br>about moving up the value chain and so<br>on how do we balance this targeting of<br>high margin<br>um food and exports globally versus<br>being able to supply lowcost food<br>locally that's one of the questions<br>we've got coming through from Slider how<br>do we balance those two<br>tensions yeah I'll have a got that's a<br>tricky one isn't it and there always<br>been a tension if you get high value for<br>your products when you export them then<br>you expect to get similar prices for<br>them in New Zealand and uh we provide<br>extremely good quality Dairy and meat<br>products and we get good prices for them<br>internationally and our consumers as a<br>result um end up paying relatively high<br>prices for products that they think well<br>why is this happening given we grow so<br>much of it here and we do export most of<br>it um yeah like I don't have the answer<br>to that unfortunately like if you're a<br>company that is selling a product you<br>want to get the highest possible price<br>for it but there is a bit of license to<br>operate for the industry here and you I<br>know that the dairy industry for example<br>and the meat industry have done a lot of<br>providing food like milk and schools and<br>food into food banks and a lot of work<br>like that and meet the need from the<br>meat industry there's been a lot of work<br>done to provide food for free um to a<br>lower so socioeconomic groups doesn't<br>really fix the kind of the ticket price<br>that you see at the supermarket but um I<br>do think that there's other ways to add<br>higher value though so we talk about<br>back to the emissions thing that I<br>started with it's true now that those<br>companies like nesle are paying a<br>premium for low emission product and<br>it's small now but it is growing so uh<br>they are they have started paying a<br>premium to New Zealand for our low<br>emission products and as long as we can<br>retain that and remain low emission they<br>will continue to pay more uh meat sector<br>is not quite there yet although there<br>are firms like silver F selling their<br>zeroc carbon product and I think we'll<br>increasingly see that if you want to com<br>compete with the sort of products that<br>Professor sing talked about that uh you<br>know that come from plant-based you're<br>going to have to be able to deliver<br>those kind of<br>products<br>thanks I guess where I'd like to turn to<br>now is one of the questions on<br>government industry collaboration which<br>will have some links with what we've<br>just been talking about as well how can<br>policy makers and the agricultural<br>industry collaborate more effectively to<br>co-create policies that address the<br>challenges and opportunities associated<br>with disrupting traditional agriculture<br>New Zealand maybe we'll start with you<br>Lane if you'd like to so um first of<br>all um just let me acknowledge the<br>importance of that the agre zero model<br>uh which Wayne is leading that is so<br>important because it is an example of a<br>public private partnership in action<br>where you've got uh large organizations<br>in New Zealand partnering with the<br>government putting in place focused<br>governance specialist management<br>and importantly then um really creating<br>the uh the potential for investment<br>intensity around a mission around a<br>mission to get cut through there is no<br>reason why that model couldn't be<br>replicated in the forestry sector uh in<br>the oceans sector and so sometimes it's<br>it's about hey let's find what works and<br>really look to to take that model and<br>look for other opportunities in that<br>sort of<br>space when we're talking about new<br>Industries that's more challenging<br>because you have an agency problem the<br>beautiful thing about the dairy sector<br>is there's a lot of critical mass there<br>there are a lot of active participants<br>and there is an ability to align Capital<br>around it when we're talking about new<br>Industries in emerging sectors then that<br>Capital depth doesn't exist and then<br>you're going to need more support<br>proportionately from the government so<br>there is a a calibration issue in there<br>the most important thing that is that we<br>are Mindful and focused and proactive<br>and brave about this if we think we can<br>drift into the future with an<br>incrementalist approach and achieve the<br>lunch anything that the other panelists<br>would like to add on that one I think be<br>bold is a nice uh is a nice lesson on<br>this I totally agree with l it's um uh<br>we cannot be incremental if we decide to<br>see some newer opportunities like the<br>you know aculture sort of space you<br>mentioned and and there's many other uh<br>seaweed for example there's a quite a<br>few startups coming up as well in that<br>space so if you don't kind of get into<br>something that is uh um going to be<br>important for future and also open this<br>diversification of our exports within<br>the primary sector I I think we need to<br>get our policies lined up and and the<br>investment problem with infrastructure<br>investments in many cases to start<br>something new uh is a challenge that's<br>where private sector and and government<br>need to work together in regulatories<br>obviously is got a big problem to solve<br>in some cases such as genetic<br>modifications I mentioned<br>before yeah and I'll add I think being<br>bold is important and I think G Gene<br>editing Etc we do need to have a good<br>conversation around that there are real<br>opportunities in the sector we're<br>working in for Gene edited Technologies<br>to reduce emissions not necessarily in<br>the animal itself but in the feeds that<br>you give to the animal U so we just we<br>do need to be looking at that and it is<br>it is an opportunity for us and we will<br>get left behind because the rest of the<br>world is already moving on this quite<br>rapidly in many areas um it's hard for<br>the public sector to be bold they need<br>to have ministerial cover um doesn't<br>always work when you're bold and<br>something goes wrong so I think you know<br>ministers need to think carefully about<br>the way they they encourage that and<br>then support it because it won't always<br>go right if you take risk you're not<br>always going to get it right so I think<br>that will be important for the<br>government if they want to be bold<br>they're going to have to stand up and<br>sector you talked about this need for<br>difficult conversations we've also got<br>these very challenging um adoption of<br>new technologies New Zealand doesn't<br>want to get left behind um what's the<br>role of training um what what's the role<br>of personnel development in this perhaps<br>I might start with you how gender sit<br>you're based in the University Lane<br>you've also got wide experience in in HR<br>issues so i' I'd be curious about what<br>you have to um suggest on the need for a<br>change in a way perhaps we do we we deal<br>with with skills in agriculture to make<br>sure that we support this disrupted<br>sector or disruptive<br>sector yeah and the disruptive sector I<br>think uh the key<br>is um providing kind of focused<br>activities um in terms of R&amp;D obviously<br>South with R&amp;D in the r Institute we do<br>um attempt we have attempted to bring<br>together some of the key areas of<br>expertise to Target Precision<br>fermentation for example and also<br>molecular farming uh I think it's going<br>to be critical that we have skilled<br>Workforce in this space that is the<br>problem that's always kind of a wor<br>about that when we brought that idea<br>forward that we may be bit behind but if<br>we don't do anything we'll be even<br>further behind so at least our future<br>Workforce should be trained in some of<br>these Technologies not everyone would be<br>but so in the future we have a<br>innovators we have the environment for<br>startups and collaborations and and that<br>this is and that will interract<br>Investments uh for future uh into New<br>Zealand of course but<br>also that way we can expand our<br>International Network as well because<br>that's critically important so we can<br>train our people and in the right way<br>through Part International<br>Partnerships uh absolutely critically<br>important to have a sort of focused R&amp;D<br>activities and Innovation activities in<br>that space are the specific bottlenecks<br>are the specific areas Lan what what's<br>so first of all I I should just<br>acknowledge that this is uh you know<br>hugely uh complex<br>and tough area it's made much more acute<br>by the demographic challenges we have um<br>the reality is that the average age of<br>New Zealand kiwi fruit farmers is over<br>60 years old um they have you know<br>massive capital investment there are<br>succession issues and not just<br>succession issues from a monetary<br>perspective but from a skills and<br>capability perspective um there are so<br>um so first of all absolutely agree with<br>uh Professor Singh investment in R&amp;D um<br>being re so that so that the opportunity<br>to add value high value probably means<br>high technology and by definition that<br>means High capability and that means<br>investment in our universities<br>investment in our Cris investment in<br>bringing our students through that will<br>be absolutely critical for us but<br>immigration also will play a part and<br>that's very confronting for us but we<br>need a whole lot of Labor including<br>highly skilled labor and so really<br>thinking about what we're doing on the<br>borders how we bring capability here<br>what environment we're creating for<br>investment uh FDI and how that can be<br>reconciled with our needs for<br>sovereignty in the sector particularly<br>in some of these uh modern food and<br>fiber value chains uh these are deep uh<br>and very challenging issues I'm excited<br>about the session on demographics we<br>have later today because I just think<br>it's so important<br>yeah and I agree with all of that and I<br>was going to put immigration in as well<br>as being critical there's also the point<br>though if you train people and you<br>develop them you then need to pay them<br>adequately so that they stay here<br>because we lose a lot of talent people<br>go overseas and traditionally it's all<br>you go overseas for a few years as I did<br>and you come back and you you do<br>something different a lot of people<br>don't come back so a million kiwi living<br>offshore we need to train people well we<br>need to then pay them well enough to<br>retain them um and we get so it's<br>another complex policy issue how you how<br>you develop that um but yeah all of<br>those things I may just add that on our<br>experience um working at the University<br>postco it has become increasingly<br>difficult to track high quality staff as<br>well as postgraduate students that you<br>might have experienced in v as well this<br>is actually had a huge impact on um<br>through the immigration we policy we had<br>actually hadn't helped and universities<br>certainly face their own Channel<br>challenges but it was good to hear the<br>three of you think that we're part of<br>the potential solution as well I'm going<br>to change tax slightly here uh and ask a<br>rather more specific question that's<br>come through um how do you see the role<br>of sector sector finances um the tier<br>one Banks and so on needing to change<br>their approach to agricultural<br>operations in the future I'm not sure<br>which of you would like to have a go at<br>this one<br>first yeah I'll have a go first I've<br>been talking to quite a lot of banks<br>lately um yeah they are they are<br>changing the way they think around<br>particularly around sustainability and<br>and sustainable loans and in that area<br>there is a lot of focus from Banks I<br>mean they're being regulated required to<br>do it so uh but nevertheless we are we<br>are seeing the banking sector think a<br>lot more around the way it finances the<br>sector from that perspective um you know<br>banking I'm I'm no expert in banking<br>it's pretty straightforward they largely<br>all do the same thing in the same way um<br>I think some innovation in the banking<br>sector would would be helpful you know<br>it was mentioned earlier foreign direct<br>investment I think we we need to be more<br>open than than we are to foreign direct<br>investment has its challenges as well uh<br>you look at the capital infrastructure<br>challenges we have in this country<br>they're going to have to be part of the<br>answer um I'm not sure I'm really<br>answering the question I'm no banking<br>expert but that's that's kind of my two<br>cents with we do have a a finance panel<br>coming up a bit later in fored any other<br>comments that oh I think I should leave<br>it to the<br>finance right<br>note down that one Matt um okay I've<br>I've got a very popular question here<br>that I'm going to ask out directly as<br>it's come through all three speakers<br>talk about ghg from agriculture but all<br>three fail to consider emissions per<br>kilo of nutritional value if you talk of<br>a society with an increasing bottom and<br>bottom end surely a liter of Bine milk<br>is going to do a thousand times more for<br>a child than a liter of oat milk as one<br>example<br>you<br>toiss well I didn't ignore emissions per<br>uh for the nutritional value um because<br>clearly it is important uh I did note<br>that all of the customers I talked about<br>have absolute reduction Targets in<br>emissions so they want to prove<br>deficiency but they also want to see net<br>emissions reduce because if we don't<br>reduce emissions the world will keep<br>getting hotter uh that is the point at<br>the end of the day um but I mean clearly<br>our sector produces incredibly good<br>quality um protein and fat products from<br>dairy and meat very high quality food um<br>and and some of those other products my<br>view don't at all compete um but<br>nevertheless consumers are looking for<br>choice and variation and it depends<br>where you are in the market doesn't it<br>if you're talking about for children<br>then then clearly um for older adults<br>there are different drivers um I think<br>we we do need to keep selling a story of<br>of why what we sell is of very high<br>quality and but our companies do do a<br>pretty good job of that and as was said<br>earlier the population is growing so<br>there is opportunity there for for us to<br>have our place and and others to come in<br>as well but yes emissions intensity is<br>certainly part of the<br>story let me ask an Associated question<br>I'll maybe direct this one at you the<br>negative impact of deiri and meat is<br>widely publicized what are the impacts<br>of<br>plantbased products are they<br>significantly better and are there other<br>concerns<br>um not generally widely talked about do<br>you have any comments on on this please<br>yeah there's a considerable debate so<br>it's not that clearcut that the<br>emissions from at least some of the<br>plant-based uh products we see uh<br>replacing Dairy are any better but it's<br>also s a b of trend that the work in<br>progress in some ways to to prove for<br>example Amed milk and walnuts and<br>produced from nut type milks still a<br>debate especially with Ammons that does<br>actually the the data actually Stacks up<br>in terms of the impact on the<br>environment uh in some other cases might<br>be easier to justify but even some of<br>the neurot Technologies I mentioned<br>still sell or<br>agriculture there is no kind of real<br>data available and meaningful data<br>available to prove that they can<br>actually reduce um emissions for example<br>um so if you especially if you calculate<br>per gram of protein or per sort per<br>nutritive<br>value is a work in progress but um at<br>the same time some of these Trends are<br>not just um related to sort of milk<br>versus oat milk it's also related to<br>ethical concerns Animal Welfare so<br>there's a vegan<br>consumers uh their aspirations are<br>somewhat different than compared to more<br>flexitarian approaches where people are<br>prepared to sort of have a blend of um<br>different kind of options plant-based<br>versus animal based so it's a kind of<br>difficult question to answer in that<br>context I think there's some modeling<br>was done El you may know s of you've<br>been part of discussion in your group<br>just so first of all um the sustainable<br>nutrition uh Institute here in New<br>Zealand Sni uh has done fantastic uh<br>work in this area uh there is a whole<br>bunch of data there and models which are<br>available um so<br>um there is a fact basee um which which<br>is available and actually uh New Zealand<br>um is doing some thought leadership in<br>the space um for for um you know for us<br>here in New Zealand there's this<br>tendency to you know is is is meat<br>better than plants or worse than plants<br>um you know what is the role of dairy in<br>the in future nutrition um you know how<br>important is plant F uh uh plant-based<br>food and and um uh and um um you know<br>should that grow how do we decarbonize<br>um Global food production all of these<br>are valid questions and of course there<br>is a nutritional element uh to those<br>questions my proposal is that we should<br>focus on what we on what we should do as<br>opposed to trying to have a debate about<br>what's bad or or or what we shouldn't do<br>because actually uh you know so so first<br>of all the dairy industry in New Zealand<br>it's strategically important to our<br>country let's decarbonize it let's focus<br>on excellence in um nutrient management<br>and let's continue to support and grow<br>that sector because it's important from<br>a nutrition perspective globally and<br>it's important from a New Zealand<br>economic perspective at the same time<br>let's focus on aquaculture because that<br>does have both an economic potential and<br>a very interesting environmental uh<br>opportunity and so you know this this<br>this idea of trying to make meat bad or<br>or or dairy bad it's it's not an<br>interesting way to think about it and<br>interestingly it's not how other<br>countries are thinking about it what<br>countries around the world are doing is<br>they're they're they're asking the<br>question where can we have Advantage how<br>can we uh optimize environmental<br>outcomes it's proactive thinking it's<br>not about deleting things and so the<br>important if we add fish into this<br>discussion if we talk more explicitly<br>about fish protein um do we need more<br>investment in the fish protein area is a<br>question that's come through uh very<br>high value product um potentially<br>different I'll come out out of my corner<br>and say absolutely off the top of my<br>head I think the uh last government uh<br>had an objective uh to grow agriculture<br>through $3 billion it's about 600<br>million today that should be 10 billion<br>uh and it should be an area of absolute<br>National Focus for us taking into<br>account our water space and our need to<br>grow exports and the carbon footprint uh<br>you know of aquaculture and the need for<br>protein globally we have a huge<br>opportunity in that space But we will<br>not get there without National focus and<br>Alignment<br>encourage yeah we did aquaculture reform<br>when I was back in the ministry of<br>Fisheries it's languished ever since I<br>think we' never really quite got there<br>it's pretty controversial because who<br>you know do you want to have a salmon<br>farm in front of your beach house um is<br>is controversial when you get into the<br>areas but the the deep water aquaculture<br>that's being developed now um has real<br>promise and I certainly strongly support<br>the need for more Agriculture and um I<br>cheered the Fisheries industry<br>transformation plan last year and um<br>that's gone now because the government<br>got rid of all the industry<br>transformation plans but there is real<br>opportunity in the wild Court fishery as<br>well to um to improve the value of that<br>and reduce environmental impact uh and<br>the industry and government actually are<br>pretty well aligned so I think there's<br>opportunity in that industry too yeah so<br>it's really across that Spectrum isn't a<br>traditional the new products and and the<br>fisheries and so on as well okay we've<br>got another another very popular<br>question this is actually coming from<br>some of our school participants from<br>Scots College um agriculture how can we<br>encourage young people to enter research<br>career Pathways into alternative protein<br>Technologies as there is little<br>awareness when a traditional farming<br>career appears less desirable to some so<br>I guess these alternative farming<br>careers how can we raise awareness of of<br>these amongst young<br>people um I think there are kind of<br>different areas of discipline obviously<br>the the agriculture production system<br>there certain obviously high-tech also<br>you know like a procision agriculture<br>indoor farming so the exciting stuff on<br>farm and growing foods and some<br>graduates will be very much much<br>interested in that new technologies on<br>form Technologies so that's sort of one<br>area then the post form where the food<br>technology food science comes in and<br>there we need to look at how we produce<br>more interdisciplinary knowledge I think<br>that's what's U probably need to be done<br>across where food science is being<br>taught food technology how we bring in<br>some more distructive<br>thinking uh multidisiplinary thinking uh<br>into into the training programs uh for<br>our uh future graduates uh we are doing<br>that in our Institute very much that way<br>but at a postgraduate level at a PhD<br>level where we can um get people from<br>different disciplines from molecular<br>biology from genetic engineering from<br>computer science so they can actually<br>have this blend of uh different<br>interdisplinary understanding and<br>knowledge so I think that's kind of<br>model of interdisciplinary training uh<br>focusing on the future food is the area<br>that we can focus on but traditionally<br>that need to permeate into undergraduate<br>and also to some extent School type of<br>teaching so there are kind of programs<br>in place but more needs to be done in<br>that space yeah I mean I guess there's<br>going to be some very exciting<br>opportunities for these young folks from<br>Scots college and our other students who<br>are listening in in here uh with the<br>changes in technology that our panelists<br>have talked about also artificial<br>intelligence that we've only just<br>touched on um briefly but we're really T<br>talking about a landscape that may<br>change quite dramatically from people<br>thinking about going into farming and<br>and milking cows you know prec Precision<br>agriculture new technology any other<br>thoughts from um you Wayne and Lane on<br>on you know making sure we get the right<br>I one more yeah I always tell my student<br>this is the most I've done sort of 40<br>years in food science this is the most<br>exciting time to be food<br>scientist but rapidly changing so we've<br>got to be have that forward looking and<br>that's why these insights from the<br>penless Lan anything you wanted to<br>comment further on um just<br>that science technology modern Foods<br>it's a hugely exciting space so for the<br>young people in the room I would really<br>encourage you to look at it I'm pretty<br>sure the demand for skills is going to<br>be<br>strong and I guess you know we've got a<br>lot of uh a lot of questions coming<br>through about plant protein alternative<br>plant protein um so this is an area that<br>I guess people are thinking about quite<br>quite carefully during during this panel<br>um so Henda could you provide a little<br>bit of exposition about the current<br>difficulties at this alternative protein<br>production faces um you know Wayne also<br>talked about the fact New Zealand<br>doesn't want to get left or or can't<br>afford to be left behind in this but<br>what are the current challenges that we<br>really face in moving into some of these<br>newer<br>areas yeah and the plant proteins space<br>itself is um has developed quite a lot<br>it's already well developed uh in some<br>ways so there they're basically what<br>you're looking at finding new sources of<br>protein now new legumes and pulses and<br>they've been quite popular so they<br>become quite mainstream so the idea<br>there is to find a new way of extracting<br>those protein in a more sustainable way<br>and then you create products that<br>consumers will like so simply that so<br>basically your some of your protein<br>intake comes from these newer Foods<br>rather than from a traditional food so<br>that so the challenge is still is that<br>uh the matching the quality of what<br>people used to if you're eating meat if<br>you're eating a burger versus the the<br>plant-based worker is still not the same<br>there's a nutritional differences there<br>are taste differences texture<br>differences so companies like impossible<br>foods made got worth $2 billion dollar<br>now it's only came on board about 10<br>years ago I think 10 or 12 years ago so<br>so their solution was for example so<br>they took plant protein like anyone else<br>then they discovered genetically<br>modified they can<br>genetically in a genetically modified<br>microorganism they can produce leg<br>hemoglobin that come from legum but it<br>is produced in a microb and that<br>material tastes like meat so all they<br>did is take that and mix with their<br>plant-based burger and that become<br>impossible Burger so it was small it<br>looked small Innovation but it had<br>changed it had CAU the imagination so<br>that that's kind of things happening so<br>the taste matching as well as nutrition<br>matching is the next big challenge<br>whether whether these product can<br>deliver in terms of health in terms of<br>nutrition in terms of expected taste and<br>texture um consumer ATU so that that's<br>still over time I my my prediction is<br>that they will become better we the<br>other thing is going to happen is the<br>Blends will come into play so you got<br>plantbase it cannot be it's already<br>happening there are companies um doing<br>things like they're<br>producing uh meat protein myoglobin and<br>through my through procision<br>fermentation then you take the myoglobin<br>you mix with<br>plant-based meat so that begin to taste<br>like<br>meat but it is a vegan so it got animal<br>protein but it is a vegan so I said that<br>kind of thing is already beginning to<br>happen so the some of the challenges<br>cannot be solved so these cross um<br>hybrid products are beginning to emerge<br>uh where animal protein can come from<br>somewhere else I think sorry we I<br>watching the timer here and we're almost<br>out of time but I can see that there's<br>going to be lots of people grabbing each<br>of our three panelists during the the<br>upcoming pan uh coffee break and<br>throughout the rest of the day but I'm<br>going to give them five seconds each<br>they can all see the clock here what's<br>the single most important te uh takeaway<br>about this disrupting Agriculture and<br>the future of agriculture in New Zealand<br>five seconds single way opportunity<br>there is huge opportunity here for our<br>sector uh we are in a very good place<br>now I I just think we we can grab hold<br>of yeah don't focus on the negatives<br>look at the things we can do um to<br>continue to develop and grow our<br>industry the value of it so that's my<br>takeaway agenda 5 Seconds yeah this is<br>the most exciting sector I think to be<br>part of uh the new food Revolution and<br>we should all embrace it<br>it's never been more important that we<br>um really work together and have<br>courage well what a wonderful start to<br>our 2024 economics Forum thank you very<br>much for these rich insights that draw<br>on a wealth of experience from our three<br>panelists um do you know do catch up<br>with them we've already got these links<br>with the subsequent uh panels but uh for<br>now we say thank you very much to our<br>panelists for the uh wonderful start to<br>our 2024 forum</p></main><footer
