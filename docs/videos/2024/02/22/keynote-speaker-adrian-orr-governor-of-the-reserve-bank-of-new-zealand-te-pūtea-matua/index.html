full program ahead<br>and in just a moment or two we will be<br>joined by Adrian o the governor of The<br>Reserve Bank uh unfortunately Adrien was<br>is unwell and and was unable to uh make<br>it up here last night so he's going to<br>be joining us on the uh small screen<br>behind me uh so he'll be here uh in in<br>spirit if not in body and we'll get into<br>a good conversation with him uh for<br>those of you that were here yesterday uh<br>a wonderful day I've chatted to many<br>people over a coffee and Rich<br>conversations that of course continue<br>once the discussion on stage is finished<br>which is the point of these discussions<br>so thanks again to all of our wonderful<br>speakers and facilitators for those of<br>you that stayed for the dinner last<br>night uh a remarkable conversation<br>between two former Prime Ministers Jim<br>buer and Helen Clark wonderfully Leed uh<br>by Josie Pagani who is available to fill<br>in as Speaker of the House at short<br>notice having uh having managed Ying<br>prime ministers in a way that few can so<br>the program for this morning we will<br>hear from Adrien we will then take a<br>short break again I'm conscious it was a<br>long day yesterday and an early start uh<br>at about 8:45 we'll be joined by uh<br>treasury secretary Carol mes we will<br>then have a panel discussion uh on<br>fiscal policy Treasury and the state of<br>the books which we can think of as uh<br>dueling economists there'll be some<br>interesting views there so I'm looking<br>forward to that straight into<br>infrastructure session another break and<br>then our last sessions of the Forum will<br>be around climate and weather and what<br>happens if we can't curb emissions<br>looking out then uh finishing on the<br>future notice uh note looking at the<br>fintech sector critical and growing<br>sector before we wrap up just at 1:00 so<br>we have a full program uh we'll give you<br>plenty of breaks and plenty of caffeine<br>and I look forward to another excellent<br>morning so that's the program and now if<br>the technology<br>does greetings Governor can you hear me<br>I can yes thank you very much<br>K and I before you begin welcome thank<br>you again this is your fourth appearance<br>at the New Zealand economics Forum at<br>your old University so good to have you<br>back and um and sorry to hear you unwell<br>but we're looking forward to your<br>yours<br>kot and thank you again Matt for um<br>having me on the guest list and<br>apologies everyone there that I can't be<br>in person uh is to your benefit not mine<br>um uh in terms of uh running around<br>being a super spreader no it's not Co<br>but um it's not fun enough about me uh I<br>do actually want to want to note that<br>you have some very senior members of<br>tmr2 of The Reserve Bank of New Zealand<br>in the room with you in fact two<br>monetary policy committee members uh<br>Karen silk and Paul Conway so uh any<br>difficult questions you can hit them up<br>in the uh over coffee um after the<br>speech and you're right I have been back<br>to back here at wakato University which<br>has been wonderful and uh the agenda has<br>always uh looked really pragmatic<br>practical and um and on topic so that's<br>great I know Carol Lee will be chatting<br>after me um one of our key tasks that I<br>talk about in the speech is the<br>criticality of uh of the fiscal policy<br>monetary policy um uh working in unison<br>together together it sounds simple it<br>sounds easy we can see each other across<br>the Terrace uh but it's always<br>incredibly complex around time Horizons<br>decision making so on so forth but um uh<br>I'm sure Carol Le will uh talk to that<br>uh my talk today really is on the recent<br>changes to the monetary policy<br>committee's objectives um and how they<br>fit very well with uh flexible inflation<br>targeting here at tpmr tour uh and<br>really it's um in part reminding people<br>uh what we've been doing over the last<br>three decades but bringing it into the<br>more recent context of what we have just<br>experienced over the last 3 to five<br>years uh I'll briefly note um some of<br>other key priorities um and again Paul<br>and Karen being in the room and<br>potentially some other resub bank staff<br>um do um hit them up about some of these<br>priorities because they are all rich and<br>meaningful research areas and uh you<br>know we need we need people focusing on<br>these issues the agenda actually at the<br>W University does focus on it we've got<br>technology later on um absolutely<br>critical um to uh what we are talking<br>about uh you know we are a full service<br>Central Bank um which uh which is a<br>wonderful thing uh full service we've<br>got the monetary policy Financial<br>stability our cash um uh obligations and<br>of course significant parts of the<br>financial infrastructure that keeps RT<br>New Zealand uh operating um on a on real<br>time so first um I do want to uh I know<br>it's early in the morning and um uh so<br>uh I apologize for this but I did just<br>want to kind of set the scene by talking<br>a little bit around the types of<br>inflation that we observe and how they<br>have evolved over time so I was just<br>going to um perhaps put up slide one if<br>we could um please is I don't know if<br>that blanks me out or not but sorry if<br>it<br>doesn't um but slide one whether you can<br>read that or not um uh no I'm not going<br>to talk to the slide you know monetary<br>policy is tasked with ensuring that we<br>achieve 2% headline inflation on average<br>through time over the medium term so a<br>key challenge for us as policy makers<br>and by the way I'm talking<br>internationally not just domestically a<br>key challenge for policy makers is<br>distinguishing between the transit<br>and the persistent or core inflation<br>pressures that we see in the<br>economy as the name transitory suggests<br>of course um they should be temporary<br>these are generally relative price<br>movements um that will work their way<br>out of the system without any particular<br>policy adjustment transitory inflation<br>is usually caused by unexpected relative<br>price shocks and will tend to dissipate<br>through time but they are measured in<br>head line inflation meanwhile the core<br>inflation component the persistent part<br>uh uh is that inflation that you know is<br>Left Behind when these transitory<br>relative price shocks have worked their<br>way out of the<br>economy so we observe headline but we<br>are targeting in a large sense core<br>inflation core inflation is driven<br>things like by things like uh the<br>capacity constraints in an economy you<br>know the balance between supply and<br>demand and and the prices upwards or<br>downwards on General level of prices uh<br>they also obviously get affected by<br>product markets I mean labor market<br>dynamics and wage inflation are an<br>incredibly important part of core<br>inflation and as I mentioned if they<br>feed into the general price level then<br>that can become<br>persistent expectations of future<br>inflation also feed into core inflation<br>you if inflation is widely expected to<br>be higher in the future then uh then<br>people think well if I'm very confident<br>around my expectations I will start to<br>change my wage demands or my pricing<br>demands and if I'm able to pass that<br>through to uh to consumers or some other<br>business I will do my best to do so so<br>inflation expectations really can leak<br>into into core inflation and uh and they<br>are a number one challenge around<br>anchoring longer term uh inflation<br>Target inflation expectations get away<br>you have to do an enor what to work to<br>rearn rewin your credibility of getting<br>uh inflation back to your 2%<br>Target uh so the monetary policy landens<br>I said you know um leans most through<br>the persistent inflation pressures uh we<br>want to ensure that headline inflation<br>is always expected to return to our<br>Target now so thank you for that uh that<br>uh uh motherhood speech on inflation I I<br>want to just talk about uh some of of<br>the realtime challenges measures of core<br>inflation uh estimate the persistent in<br>component um we try to strip out the<br>transitory measures from Headline<br>inflation uh but our real challenge is<br>that uh these measures of core inflation<br>can evolve Through Time a measure of<br>core inflation now uh for this quarter<br>uh first quarter 2024 will end up being<br>quite different by the time we<br>reestimate a measure of core inflation<br>for this quarter in a year's time these<br>are models and Frameworks and<br>understanding what is seeping into the<br>bones of that core inflation so the<br>prone to<br>revision uh we do lots of different ways<br>of dissecting uh headline inflation to<br>to try and get insights into our<br>estimates of core inflation uh often you<br>will hear economists talk about<br>tradeables versus non-tradables<br>inflation and this is our ability to<br>dissect headline inflation what comes<br>out from stats New Zealand or whichever<br>um jurisdiction you're in and we can<br>split it into this concept of<br>non-tradable inflation changes<br>non-tradables are really about the<br>inflation that is coming from the<br>production within your economy for goods<br>and services the domestic production<br>Supply um uh constraints and domestic<br>driven inflation it can be influenced by<br>these transitory shocks particularly if<br>um if transitory shocks are feeding into<br>inflation expectations but it's mostly<br>about the core more domestic driven uh<br>inflation by contrast and certainly high<br>profile in RT New Zealand given our<br>small open economy uh tradeables<br>inflation uh are driven by International<br>price movements primarily uh in products<br>product markets and of course uh our<br>exchange rate and these tradable<br>inflations uh trade trade inflations uh<br>reflect really long-term structural<br>changes globally in any economy we we've<br>had the talk a long talked about China<br>dividend around lowering the relative<br>price of imported goods uh as well as a<br>lot of temporary factors particularly<br>Supply shocks and and you know I'll come<br>to a few of those in the future<br>especially around food and energy so you<br>get these uh these changes from uh we're<br>after core inflation we only uh receive<br>headline inflation we can dissect it<br>into tradeables non-tradables<br>uh and we are trying to look forward to<br>which bits we with our monetary policy<br>need to lead<br>into so to summarize measures of core<br>inflation help us identify how much of<br>headline headline inflation is<br>persistent uh and while um so the<br>identify while stripping out tradeables<br>on tradeables it gives us a good sense<br>of where the relative um pressures are<br>coming from domestic International uh<br>that's the way through<br>um of course um we also draw on a much<br>wider range we don't just sit there and<br>wait for a single price index and then<br>distort it until we find what we need um<br>we're looking at many many other<br>realtime measures of price pressures<br>such as wage growth the inflation<br>expectations anything we can glean to<br>get a sense of what is going on to the<br>underlying core<br>inflation now with that um<br>econ it's probably 101 now that would<br>have been 301 when I was at wado Unity<br>but I'll go back to after that econ 101<br>discussion uh I want to talk about the<br>changing nature of these drivers of<br>inflation over the last um three or so<br>years you know the period between 2020<br>and 2023 up until now has been uh<br>incredibly unique around what has been<br>happening and I'll talk to it by these<br>um tradable non-tradeable<br>inflation so going back uh to the early<br>20 20s which I have to say feels like a<br>lifetime ago in some ways the onset of<br>the covid-19 um virus created this<br>unprecedented Global uncertainty for<br>policy makers all policy makers monetary<br>policy and fiscal policy makers<br>included uh mostly um across the world<br>policy makers central banks private<br>sector economists um around the world<br>anticipated a very deep recession an<br>economic downturn and and uh potentially<br>uh deflation negative inflation so we're<br>at the beginning of 2020 and no one<br>could really forecast you could just<br>create scenarios and think around what<br>it was so faced with these deep<br>recession prospects um monetary and<br>fiscal policy makers again almost<br>uniformly globally uh provided<br>historical levels of financial support<br>monetary support fiscal support as well<br>as um uh Financial Market support around<br>making sure our markets could operate<br>prices could be made our day-to-day<br>business could um continue on uh with<br>covid-19 spreading rapidly uh it didn't<br>just suddenly arrive it um it arrived<br>and spread uh it was having devastating<br>consequences on global economic activity<br>and human health and uh well-being and<br>the only there was only a hope of a<br>vaccine we have to remember at that<br>stage so<br>policy makers T included you know lent<br>on the side that it was probably going<br>to be better um to choose which mistake<br>you were going to make whatever it was<br>because there was no way to predict it<br>perfect uh it was better to main um<br>better to um rather than do too little<br>to maintain economic social cohesion we<br>were better at leaning on um doing too<br>much and so we were very um uh strident<br>as in our monetary easing and financial<br>market operations and this was<br>absolutely with a view a short-term view<br>to retaining I would say economic and<br>social cohesion at the<br>time<br>uh in New Zealand I'm moving forward now<br>in time by early 2021 we we moved<br>forward year um thanks to the remarkable<br>development and um of a vaccine and<br>containment I would say not not<br>eradication of covid-19 um and the<br>strong monetary and fiscal support<br>globally and domestically the economies<br>were running strong certainly well above<br>any expectation one year earlier so it<br>was a positive surprise um we were in a<br>position where the vaccine had come<br>people were moving the fiscal and<br>monetary responses had worked and we<br>were in this now in a different<br>decision- making um Place uh with the<br>increasing demand you know those people<br>who had retained jobs jobs and<br>incomes uh uh you know spending was<br>rising and of course supply chain<br>challenges remained so we go away from<br>we're starting to see some core<br>inflation pressure building up as well<br>as significant tradable inflation<br>pressure building up whether temporary<br>or permanent and so by the mid of 2021<br>headline inflation had reached 3.3% in<br>RTI New Zealand that's above 3.0% the<br>top of our range uh uh and this meant<br>that we had to be thinking much harder<br>around now what is the future for<br>containing that this is where the world<br>split um uh we didn't sit and wait to<br>work out which side of the world um um<br>won the debate but the world you know<br>monetary policy debate was around this<br>inflation surge across countries whether<br>it was transitory you know Supply shocks<br>Etc or whether it was now going to be<br>more persistent and really needing a<br>significant monetary policy response uh<br>Team<br>transitory uh had the prevailing view<br>that most inflation uh was that was<br>driven by these supply chain bottlenecks<br>uh that they would heal very quickly<br>once people were allowed to move again<br>and that labor Supply would bounce back<br>and uh be available to all as the<br>vaccines were rolled out so very strong<br>uh uh faith in the relative price<br>movements coming right again uh once<br>once people were allowed to be back out<br>on the streets and travel<br>internationally so on and so forth uh<br>Team persistent um uh the opposition I<br>don't know who was wearing red and blue<br>or yellow and green team persistent<br>highlighted you know the strong domestic<br>economies and tight labor markets um you<br>know labor shortages with the number one<br>um pain for businesses not being able to<br>find people uh with ongoing robust<br>demand especially those people who had<br>been remained connected to the labor<br>market uh falling unemployment because<br>of growing all pointed to Rising core<br>inflation pressures so when we looking<br>at what the real- time measures were um<br>our estimates of core inflation in New<br>Zealand um had remained reasonably<br>subdued in fact I might ask if we can go<br>to figure figure one please uh oh that's<br>beautiful look at that figure one I<br>cheated it's actually got two graphs so<br>um uh you can see uh in that graph<br>there's uh two it's the same thing<br>measured but one's measured in real time<br>what can we see with real data moving<br>forward the other one is measured now<br>looking back so it gives you the idea of<br>um of how of how adaptive measures of<br>core inflation can be but what you can<br>see there is even though headlin<br>inflation had hit the 3.3% gone north of<br>the band core inflation remained pretty<br>subdued in mid 2021 our models<br>indicating was at about 2.2<br>2.3% um you know which is when I last<br>look very close to the midpoint of our<br>Target and so that is um you know that<br>was our signal around the core inflation<br>but if you move forward with the benefit<br>of time and more data um these estimates<br>for um the mid 2021 have risen they rise<br>from around 2.2 to um around 3% um in<br>the second quarter of 2021 so this is a<br>real challenge around um the real time<br>measures um and um just how careful and<br>forward looking after to be on uh when<br>setting monetary policy uh of course we<br>didn't sit there as I mentioned wait for<br>for team transitory to out argue um Team<br>persistent or vice versa vice versa we<br>um we got busy and so not withstanding<br>this uncertainty on the degree of which<br>inflation was persistent or transitory<br>the monetary policy committee signaled<br>very strongly in July that monetary<br>policy had to tighten soon and<br>significantly and we provided a clear<br>par for that tightening uh it commenced<br>eventually in October it would have<br>started earlier but we went into get a<br>another variant of Co we we we all got<br>to learn about Delta and those who lived<br>in the come of older region got to learn<br>about Delta very personally Oakland went<br>into a lockdown um so we really just had<br>to wait until um not until the lockdown<br>had removed but wait until people had<br>resettled themselves and then we Contin<br>the interest rate<br>hike uh the uncertainty continued<br>throughout um 2021 uh the vaccine roll<br>out began um we had this new variant of<br>Del and then um and then much I would<br>say to the chugger and of uh Team<br>transitory Global Supply chains remain<br>fractured and these new covid-19<br>variances varant kept ripping through<br>the global<br>population uh so it became uh uh High<br>headline inflation and Rising core<br>inflation and then of course in February<br>2022 Russia invaded Ukraine putting<br>unprecedented um upward prices on on uh<br>food and energy feeding into Global<br>headline inflation and New Zealand by<br>tradable inflation so just back-to-back<br>shocks Supply constraints relative price<br>upward shocks uh at the same time as the<br>co variants are running<br>through uh uh on the back of the<br>headline inflation inflation<br>expectations also began to increase uh<br>and I might um I think we've got another<br>um slide there please<br>uh oh sorry that was just looking at<br>that slide um just um I just need to to<br>show you um we didn't mck around you<br>know we were first out of the gate by<br>some quite considerable period on the<br>monetary policy and um and other<br>countries have reacted uh in extremely<br>similar paths and we're all there or<br>thereabouts in the same kind of place<br>now financial markets are of course I'm<br>now very excited about does it continue<br>to go up or when or how long does it<br>stay where it is or when it can go down<br>it's um by the way I won't be talking<br>about that today um in part because we<br>go to our monetary policy committee<br>meeting um starting Monday next week and<br>U we'll be talking about it at late<br>February in our statement uh on the back<br>of you know the headline inflation the<br>uh inflation expectations next graph<br>please uh uh began to increase uh the<br>New Zealand one year ahead inflation<br>expectation is very volatile and and not<br>and and you know um probably rationally<br>it tends to move very closely with<br>actual headline inflation and you can<br>see that reached<br>3.7% by late<br>2021 um and then got to just over 5% by<br>the end of 2022<br>and that is very very concerning for us<br>that means that people are starting to<br>think that the Consumer Price inflation<br>they have or can see in front of them<br>will persist into the future and those<br>expectations feed in course into their<br>pricing decisions their wage demands<br>their General behavior and this is where<br>the inflation expectations can become<br>self-fulfilling I expect it to go higher<br>I ask for higher prices higher wages I<br>pass on higher costs and hence inflation<br>goes up so I expect it to be higher<br>again and so uh making sure that<br>inflation expectations don't get baked<br>in to our behavior is the core task for<br>TMR to Reserve Bank uh from early 22<br>2022 um it was only then New Zealand was<br>slowly reopening to the world uh<br>domestic spending remained strong<br>unemployment went to record low levels<br>in large part due to the lack of Labor<br>uh and when the international borders<br>open to travel it was for kiwis and<br>that's s a net outflow we didn't have<br>the net inflow that we were receiving at<br>the moment um kiwis could travel abroad<br>some kiwis came home but all of it added<br>to wage pressures uh ongoing wage<br>pressures if you're not feeling like<br>you've heard enough shocks yet I'll just<br>give you one more um uh in early 2023<br>and you know um to think it's a year on<br>now we had those devastating severe<br>storm patterns throughout new Zeal<br>and in particular Cyclone Gabriel which<br>um changed uh uh destroyed<br>infrastructure businesses took lives<br>sorry and um and again added some<br>significant uh Supply capacity pressures<br>and infrastructure demand and spending<br>throughout all this period the NPC has<br>continued tightening monetary policy<br>conditions uh to you know deliberately<br>reduce inflation by slowing demand and<br>making room for the supply capacity of<br>the economy to catch up and we had the<br>official cash rate our monetary policy<br>at<br>5.50% by May 2023 where it remains at<br>present by the end of 2023 uh I'm<br>pleased to say that headline inflation<br>has declined to 4.7% still above the<br>three uh but down from a peak of<br>7.3 uh the trade ofs inflation has done<br>a lot of that heavy lifting this is the<br>international price of goods and<br>services uh trade inflation has fallen<br>to 3% uh well down from its 8.7% peak so<br>that's come down a lot and non-tradables<br>inflation um is moving in the right<br>direction but it's moving a lot slower<br>these are the core persistent um<br>domestic components of inflation and uh<br>that's only come down by one percentage<br>point from its peak of 6.88% uh in uh in<br>early 2023 so you see that headline<br>inflation's coming down<br>the non-tradeable inflation is is moving<br>but moving much slower and a lot<br>component of that is around inflation<br>expectations and domestic price setting<br>Behavior so all measures core inflation<br>have declined we're all moving in the<br>right direction but it's this tail end<br>you know 4.7 is is more than two times<br>2% um and we've got more work to do to<br>have inflation expectations truly<br>anchored at that 2% level<br>and uh this is the part where uh<br>capacity compresses capacity pressures<br>and inflation<br>expectations are are the monetary<br>committee's real Focus to get<br>done so how does all that fit in that<br>beautiful um short historical um chat by<br>the way there's far longer and more<br>insightful and deep and meaningful<br>document called our review um of the<br>financial uh of the implementation of<br>monetary policy the one of the key<br>authors Paul Conway is sitting with you<br>so uh so um challenge him around what<br>he's doing<br>uh in terms of where we are now<br>reflecting on the reserve bank's review<br>of monetary policy remit uh has been<br>really important we under our new<br>legislation are legally obliged every<br>five years to stop look back and say is<br>this monetary policy remit suitable<br>working um for RT New Zealand I'll take<br>away the excitement our answer is yes um<br>but we did have<br>recommendations since the formal<br>adoption of inflation Target in 1990 so<br>you know a few decades back there's<br>always been some mechanism mandating<br>monetary policy to focus more on the<br>persistent components of inflation and<br>to Discount uh the transitory um<br>volatile uh uh shocks to relative prices<br>uh we do that to avoid void uh I suppose<br>jumping at shadows and leading to highly<br>volatile interest rates exchange rates<br>output and employment you know monetary<br>policy works with a lag we need to focus<br>on the bits we can<br>influence uh you know we do this to try<br>and make sure that we don't accessib<br>booms or Buss in the economy so as has<br>become clear over the decades um the<br>economy particularly in New Zealand um<br>given our small open Nature faces many<br>temporary price shocks uh these of<br>course by definition are unforeseeable<br>um they're caused by factors outside the<br>control of monetary policy usually<br>outside the control of any New Zealand<br>policy um but they often do revert back<br>quickly you know you can think about<br>global energy Global Food price uh Rises<br>and Falls that we've seen in time I<br>think there's a a graph of that if um<br>which the next figure<br>please<br>beautiful and that really there is just<br>um taking the headline CPI inflation um<br>highlighting the food and the energy<br>price components of it and you can see<br>the variability um of those two relative<br>to uh uh inflation absent those shocks<br>so while inflation can be volatile<br>months to month monetary policy<br>influences with the lag we're trying to<br>look through or discount some of those<br>near to price swings but Focus on the<br>second round impacts so they don't get<br>into core<br>inflation uh the lag of what we do to<br>the eventual inflation out income uh<br>outcome is uh has stayed pretty stable<br>right through this period which is<br>remarkable um research we just recently<br>published it remains about 18 months to<br>two years between when we shift the<br>official cash rate to the peak Maximum<br>Impact on inflation so it accumulates<br>through time it hits different parts of<br>the economy uh at different Paces um uh<br>you know the exchange rate is almost<br>instantaneous output's quite quick but<br>by the time it feeds through into actual<br>headline inflation it's anywhere between<br>18 months and two years um and by that<br>time the transitory um uh impacts have<br>largely washed out so what we're really<br>operating on is looking at the core<br>inflation<br>components uh monetary policy also<br>operates with you know significant ific<br>uncertainty uh for example the impact of<br>monetary policy on inflation can change<br>over time uh key data is also uh<br>released with a significant lag uh that<br>means we are prone to large revisions we<br>are prone to uh the use of estimates um<br>you know I'd highlight the recent um<br>revision to New Zealand's GDP which<br>stretched back over two years and um you<br>know it's and uh we continuously trying<br>to understand which parts of those<br>relate to the supply capability of the<br>economy versus the demand side the<br>difference being what we need to be<br>concerned about for inflation presses so<br>you know the simple analogy is when you<br>WIS screen is filthy it's very hard to<br>see where the next turn is uh you tend<br>to want to be cautious and not jumping<br>at um at every possible sign of a turn<br>these realities make achieving 2%<br>inflation Target with precision<br>today we on any specific specific date<br>impossible I won't say difficult I'll<br>say impossible uh one you don't want to<br>be able to do it because relative price<br>shocks are critically important and we<br>don't have any influence or control over<br>them and and two if you were trying to<br>do that you would be putting the economy<br>through uh ridiculous uncertainty<br>volatility variability and you still<br>wouldn't succeed that is a real<br>challenge so we're saying credible<br>forward-looking inflation targeting uh<br>still provides the best uh well-being<br>welfare to New Zealand um it allows for<br>a more considered response to noisy data<br>and the focus on the balance between<br>supply and demand and the role of<br>inflation<br>expectations uh it has to be a credible<br>forward looking um you know if I just<br>keep saying yeah mate one day we'll get<br>there and that's probably not going to<br>work we actually have to win the hearts<br>and Minds and be trusted by the public<br>that we are focused on achieving 2%<br>inflation uh so while the medium-term<br>concept doesn't provide a specific date<br>we have a lot of tools and<br>Communications and uh economic science<br>behind how we try to earn and retain the<br>trust of the public right throughout the<br>covid-19 period for example we always<br>had a monetary policy statement<br>uh which provided our best foot forward<br>our indicator on where interest rates<br>would need to be monetary policy to<br>achieve 2% inflation<br>Target uh between monetary policy<br>statements as new shocks and activities<br>happen or we glean more information<br>around how the economy is behaving<br>evolving we would change that interest<br>rate reaction function to continue to<br>hit the 2% inflation Target within our<br>forecast period again that that uh 18<br>months to 2 year ahead forecast period<br>uh we provide a lot of words examples<br>and access to our data and information<br>and research to earn the confidence and<br>enable um uh broader communicators the<br>market the private sector to understand<br>debate and and and effectively price<br>where they think we need to be whether<br>we've got it right or wrong to achieve<br>our Target<br>um the number one thing that we are<br>always concerned about is people would<br>lose confidence that we are aiming at<br>that 2% with real um vim and vigor so<br>that's uh that's the 2% what what does<br>all this mean uh well it means that<br>there's no single at any point and and<br>consistent Through Time optimal time<br>horizon or path for interest rates to<br>achieve that 2% fortunately it's a<br>repeat game a reset game<br>but the discipline is to make sure<br>people always know what we're aiming at<br>with confidence and<br>Trust uh how we might react to different<br>relative price shocks in between will<br>also depend on the state of the economy<br>at um any particular time this has been<br>really relevant recently um you know we<br>may be very confident to look through a<br>transitory PR shock if inflation is<br>extremely low and inflation expectations<br>are well below the midpoint that was a<br>lot of the story uh during the uh<br>2010s Global prices falling inflation<br>headline inflation globally heading<br>below um the midpoints of inflation<br>targets inflation expectations<br>continuing to decline you know we had<br>that benign period we had the China<br>dividend and um looking through<br>temporary price shops was uh was much<br>easier you had more confidence that it<br>wasn't going to feed into generalized<br>inflation uh of course if you're sitting<br>in a period of high inflation and Rising<br>inflation expectations our ability or<br>our appetite to be able to look through<br>temporary price shocks is significantly<br>reduced and that has been the case over<br>recent quarters as explained when you've<br>got Rising headline you got persistent<br>core and you've got inflation<br>expectations creeping up it is a very<br>uncomfortable position for a central<br>bank and so um central banks around the<br>world have been trying to explore expain<br>this ad nauseum to the public um that<br>whilst uh inflation is coming down we<br>are not there yet and the last few yards<br>may be very difficult because we really<br>need to re-anchor that 2% inflation<br>expectation uh so when our advice when<br>we sent it to uh the previous Minister<br>of Finance Our advice on the remit um uh<br>we recommended uh amending the remit uh<br>to really clarify the prim y of the<br>inflation<br>Target uh over and above so it was to<br>achieve low and stable inflation whilst<br>supporting uh maximum sustainable<br>employment achieve support there's<br>already implicit Primacy there uh but it<br>came into common Jon you know dual<br>targets Etc no there's a Primacy<br>involved can you please highlight that<br>and that was largely around the<br>sorry uh our mandated review however um<br>we didn't explore whether maximum<br>sustainable employment should be dropped<br>completely from the remit uh we didn't<br>explore that because that's that's not<br>our role that is a legitimate role of<br>the government of the day uh the<br>legislative matter and uh you've seen<br>that the maximum sustain sustainable<br>employment in our new roomit uh whilst<br>it's still while the labor market is<br>still discussed it's no longer sitting<br>there as a support objective um it is a<br>um a secondary consideration so whilst<br>we didn't uh recommend that we didn't<br>recommend it because it wasn't within<br>our Roy and of course<br>um uh we had been able to manage<br>incredibly well with that remit at any<br>case on that that front you know while<br>the removal of that that MSC objective<br>does provide some benefits for<br>clarifying the monetary policies<br>committee's objectives it does not mean<br>in any sense a significant change to our<br>task the monetary policy committee's<br>task the labor market is such a key<br>driver of economic activity and<br>inflation that we have to be well versed<br>well understood around the capacity the<br>capability um the the uh the workings of<br>the labor market to understand the<br>supply capacity of our economy people's<br>skills and also uh the wage impacts on<br>core inflation if wages are rising<br>purely because of higher expected<br>inflation as opposed to because of<br>higher productivity then that's an<br>inflation challenge we have rather than<br>a fantastic real world challenge of<br>having a highly productive labor force<br>growing in real incomes so these are<br>these are the challenges we remain with<br>a large research agenda and a<br>considerable<br>conversation now and forever around the<br>labor<br>market I'll just shift now um really<br>away from that to uh estimates of the<br>optimal inflation Target um and these<br>you know it's kind of interesting you<br>know what um if inflation is bad why<br>don't we Target is zero and if life was<br>just that simple um estimates of the<br>optimal inflation Target um that best<br>balances um uh many that balances the<br>cost of inflation versus the benefits of<br>of small inflation uh is a really really<br>important part of what we're doing um<br>the costs uh when we talk about it you<br>know there are the distortionary impacts<br>of inflation on the tax system uh it has<br>incredible impacts interactions with the<br>asset markets especially the housing<br>market in New Zealand that's a whole<br>another conference topic itself and the<br>relative price distortions um within the<br>market people find it much harder to<br>work out is that General inflation or is<br>that a relative price because that's a<br>better product and so all of those<br>arguments to support a very low rate of<br>inflation supporting a slightly higher<br>rate of inflation uh uh Concepts like<br>greasing the wheels of the labor market<br>this is a really important one uh it is<br>easier for people to accept or receive a<br>real wage decline or real wage increase<br>through time without having to go and<br>negotiate a nominal wage decline or a<br>nominal wage increase and so the ability<br>to have some inflation to allow real<br>prices to move uh can reduce friction in<br>an economy and of course you know the<br>ability to weather some of the price<br>shocks um if you're aiming at zero what<br>are you doing when it's negative<br>positive so opal so those uh I'll just<br>finish with one more contemporary issue<br>around what would be an optimal<br>inflation rate and that really is uh<br>what when we entered the co period the<br>number one concern globally was uh<br>deflation or very low inflation meaning<br>we are hitting the effective lower bound<br>on nominal interest rates uh the central<br>banks can only go so far in reducing the<br>interest rates What alternative ways of<br>providing sufficient<br>stimulus to continue to provide monetary<br>policy Services negative interest rates<br>quantitative easing so and so forth that<br>was a number one concern the good news<br>is with some small but positive<br>inflation you're less likely to be in<br>those discussion zones at the time I<br>remember issuing a paper in third<br>quarter 2019 around us opening up that<br>whole conversation with the market and<br>talking about negative interest rate uh<br>capability um being ready<br>quantitative tools Etc um it sounded<br>like a theoretical discussion uh four<br>months later it was a very practical<br>discussion so where are we at well you<br>know from all the work we've been doing<br>uh all the ups and downs uh and in the<br>remit we think that a 2% midpoint Target<br>is well in the zone of an optimal level<br>of inflation we don't see any particular<br>strong reason to do that and that has<br>also come through in our new remit uh I<br>don't know to take this Comfort or or<br>consensus but there's a slide there we<br>go it's already up there we are not<br>alone 2% is the midpoint across many<br>countries some have ranges between 1<br>three 0 to two but you can see the magic<br>number two is the Red Dot point across<br>most countries so that's it what have I<br>traversed uh I've traversed uh the<br>challenge around understanding core<br>inflation the fact that it can move<br>through time um based<br>uh on uh inflation expectations and<br>domestic demand pressures the fact that<br>it's not measured in real time and we<br>have to estimate forward and it will<br>change through time uh and all of those<br>feed into why we have uh a strong desire<br>to retain a forward-looking credible<br>inflation targeting regime for New<br>Zealand I will finish up very briefly um<br>whilst uh getting inflation back to 2%<br>is our number one challenge uh at this<br>present time for The Reserve Bank for<br>the man commit uh we've got a lot else<br>on and a lot else on you know covers<br>from the monetary policy Stories the the<br>research that's come out of the ref<br>Financial stability uh the cash<br>operations and financial Market<br>infrastructure uh we need your help I<br>called for that last year as well uh a<br>few of the areas we are working very<br>closely with now and Carol may talk<br>about it is is how we can better<br>coordinate monetary and fiscal policy<br>sounds simple monetary policy can react<br>to whatever we're seeing fiscal policy<br>has very different uh entry points very<br>different leads and lags and it's<br>decided by people other than treasuries<br>decided by Parliament on what happens<br>when how where so it's uh it sounds a<br>nice Simple Thing uh it has evaded most<br>developed economies uh um since modern<br>Economic Times also enhancing our<br>capability to support financial markets<br>during dysfunction we developed uh we<br>did I think 20 years of innovation in in<br>20 months During the covid period and<br>we're making sure the lessons are<br>learned the instruments are optimal and<br>we can redeploy them as and when needed<br>in the future including um a bit Capital<br>buffer and and uh and more F exchange<br>reserves uh that work will be coming out<br>soon uh we've got a massive task of<br>Landing our new deposit takers act and<br>with that a deposit compensation scheme<br>this is the scheme that if your bank<br>fails uh each person is good for up to<br>$100,000 per individual per Bank as<br>compensation uh to to keep the economy<br>moving while the bank resolution is<br>operating underway uh it'll be a single<br>coherent U Place uh we'll have to add<br>proportionality around regulation for<br>different scales institutions depending<br>on how impactful you can be uh um see<br>it's it's simple not easy and we're well<br>down the path of that we hope to have<br>the posit compensation scheme we'll have<br>the back of it broken by late this year<br>uh but uh implementation is being talked<br>about in mid 25 we're also looking<br>around um the final Landing of a deposit<br>um debt to income ratio sorry too many<br>acronyms um that's the DTI the debt to<br>income ratios is for both households and<br>investors and really it's about uh<br>having some management over the<br>probability of default for people taking<br>on excess debt it will be a complement<br>too not a substitute for our loan to<br>value ratio I think if you think about<br>the debt to income probability of<br>default uh the loan to value ratio loss<br>given default and we can become more<br>efficient in our regulation by not using<br>one instrument to try and fix another<br>problem so that that is now out for<br>final consultation um uh in the public<br>Arena uh we'll be publishing our climate<br>change stress tests which are<br>significant uh I'm pleased to say no one<br>argues why do you bother doing this<br>anymore the insurance sector is<br>extremely challenged uh but it's not<br>just them it's government policy local<br>government policy uh the industry itself<br>around pricing uh resilience uh Capital<br>levels so we are doing an enor enous<br>amount of work uh uh in part how we to<br>coordinate but also make sure we have<br>cover and robustness for this multi-year<br>again um critical uh to the coordination<br>I'm really pleased to just talk about um<br>we've been doing a lot of work around<br>Innovation cross government work with uh<br>treasury in particular uh e and the<br>private sector Banks um and broader<br>government around improving M access to<br>Capital this is about unleashing their<br>economic potential uh there are specific<br>market failures and specific historical<br>challenges that we are Focus very much<br>on a simple market failure is<br>collectively owned land looks too<br>complicated to provide a loan to uh<br>we're working with um uh the uh multi<br>land C at the moment just to clarify<br>what you can do and banks are are waking<br>up at the wheel and we've seen a couple<br>of great examples recently without any<br>change to policy they are able to find<br>ways in which they can provide Capital<br>to uh uh fena M and unleash business so<br>that's wonderful thing but data is a big<br>Drive cultural capability capacity<br>across both sides understanding each<br>other's needs providing simple um<br>guidelines and behaviors uh have been a<br>fantastic move and it's happening part<br>of that of course is sponsored by our<br>future of money program um we're going<br>to be a less cash not cash less economy<br>cash will have its role um you saw in<br>Cyclone Gabriel 2023 within 48 hours if<br>people don't have a means of exchange<br>social cohesion collapses uh and that's<br>what happened we are put the panui out<br>we've got small communities who have<br>been effectively debanked or or or deced<br>at least um how they can work with us on<br>a program of looking for more efficient<br>meth meod more effective methods of<br>making sure cash circulates in the<br>economy and we're adding to that by um<br>being very Advanced now around what a<br>central bank digital currency would look<br>like so it's central bank money as<br>opposed to private money that can arrive<br>digitally rather than in the form of a<br>note and coin so that's been a big<br>effort so that's a long wide range I'm<br>i' probably upset half my staff by not<br>mentioning the other excellent things<br>they're doing uh and uh I think I will<br>finish there thank you very much if<br>there's any time happy to um um deflect<br>together all right we are tight on time<br>so I'm going to ask you a couple of<br>questions uh but I'll I'll keep them<br>brief but many questions came through<br>over the app so uh first one and it's a<br>double barrel um um when you first spoke<br>to the economics Forum three years ago<br>we had a discussion the OCR was at 0.25<br>we were looking at the recent paper<br>navigating at low altitude remarkable<br>how fast that's come up and we saw it on<br>the on the graph<br>before two things come off that one<br>obviously and You' have highlighted this<br>it takes time for some of those<br>conditions to be translated into the<br>market we've got people rolling off<br>fixed mortgages either at home or<br>businesses and so on so are coming up uh<br>the question there is are you worried<br>about overshoot now because of the lag<br>effect the second is what's your take<br>and are you worried about the Whiplash<br>effect on households say um ordinary<br>kiwis who went out borrowed might have<br>border a peak and and the impact at a<br>household level of people are encouraged<br>to borrow they might be feeling pretty<br>high and dry now what's your take on<br>those two given the speed of<br>change yes thank you and great question<br>questions and yes we are worried um so<br>you know it is a key focus of um both<br>the monetary policy committee but we<br>also work closely with our financial<br>stability committee that's one of the<br>benefits of being you know the full<br>service Bank our financial stability<br>report I really would um encourage<br>people to read that because we talk very<br>explicitly around what the levels of<br>stress are in households as well as in<br>the financial institutions themselves on<br>the second one on the financial<br>institutions non-performing loans are<br>rising they're Rising slowly but they<br>are still at a you know historically low<br>level and when we look at and do our<br>best efforts to kind of project ahead of<br>what where they could get to they remain<br>very manageable for the financial<br>institutions themselves um you know the<br>large mortgage lenders for households uh<br>we are three quarters of the way through<br>I think the monit policy impact I think<br>the effective you can um the team there<br>can um I think we we will have a peak uh<br>effective retail interest rate of about<br>6.4% on top of my head uh by mid this<br>year and uh we're um 80% of the way<br>there now so that says people roll off<br>and then roll on to whichever um CH they<br>they choose so the're three quarters of<br>the way through that the banks<br>themselves the information we're getting<br>is that uh people are managing and a lot<br>of the growing growth and non-performing<br>lines Etc has been due to idiosyncratic<br>shocks to those particular households um<br>that's a nice way of saying if someone<br>becomes unemployed and so it's the<br>unemployment it's the labor market that<br>will create the most significant stress<br>on the ability to service Al loan it<br>hasn't been so much the price of the<br>loan yes households are being squeezed<br>yes some significant um tradeoffs are<br>having to be made in in houses but the<br>real risk of course is is uh being<br>employed so you know from a financial<br>stability sign we're saying we're in you<br>know good space uh and in the household<br>side we're saying stay close to your<br>bank stay close and make sure they're<br>working with it there is one specific<br>cohort of lending that happened over a<br>six-month period where they um hit the<br>lowest interest rate<br>and uh you know fortunately we had the<br>loan to value ratio still there but took<br>on the most debt and so that cohort is<br>you know it's narrow but the broader on<br>aggregate um you know it is very<br>manageable look I'd um it's hard to pull<br>back because we got so many questions<br>but I'm conscious we've got to keep<br>moving for the rest of the day and we're<br>about to go into the treasury discussion<br>with Carly so look I will have to wrap<br>it up there again Governor thank you for<br>uh participa even even if uh uh not in<br>person we uh wish you and the team good<br>luck we wish uh uh Paul and Karen good<br>luck answering all the questions that<br>have come through on slid over the<br>coffee we're about to have and uh we'll<br>look forward to hopefully seeing you<br>again next year thanks again all the<br>very best wishes to ever in the room and<br>apologies again for not coming up and<br>and spreading my illness great stuff all<br>right thanks Adrian cheers thank you all<br>right for those<br>here in the room we will now have a</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
