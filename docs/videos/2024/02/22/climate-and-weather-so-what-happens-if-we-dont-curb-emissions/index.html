the uh<br>coffee B I'd invite you to come and take<br>panel<br>all right we are getting underway now so<br>the uh third trigger warning so I will<br>invite our panelists out on for our<br>second to last panel on climate and<br>weather and then we will get underway so<br>panelists if you want to come<br>out<br>arrangements and can I get an iPad up<br>there<br>on so the panel on climate and weather<br>so we have this discussion at a really<br>interesting time uh last year we were<br>meeting while uh parts of the country<br>were going through incredible hardship<br>with Cyclone Gabrielle we had had<br>obviously the ockland floods and we're<br>at the anniversary time on that many<br>people of course may have seen media in<br>the last week reflecting on some of the<br>things that were happening just at that<br>moment we've got some incredible<br>panelists here on stage so Professor<br>Dave frame from University of Canterbury<br>an expert in climate science and a<br>leader of many research projects that<br>deal with uh extreme weather events and<br>climate change We Have Bryce Davies from<br>iag executive manager of corporate<br>relations right at the center of this uh<br>in the insurance industry and so Brian<br>Ro who uh has a career that's hard to<br>describe in one or two words because it<br>encompasses so many things not least uh<br>working with Helen Clark on getting the<br>Rugby World Cup to New Zealand in 2011<br>but um relevant here and that Soban has<br>just been cheering the review of the<br>response to Cyclone Gab and his his home<br>of hawks Bay so we're going to start<br>with you Dave uh to give us a bit of a<br>take on the science and what you think<br>so again the theme here is what happens<br>if we don't curb emissions floor is<br>yours sure thanks um so uh climate<br>change is already here we've already had<br>about 1.2 degrees of warming above the<br>levels we saw in the 19th century and<br>earlier um if we don't curb emissions um<br>we will that warming will just continue<br>linearly um with cumulative warming<br>cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide<br>so so C uh carbon carbon dioxide is<br>overwhelmingly the most important<br>greenhouse gas um Global emissions are<br>kind of they've kind of flatlined and<br>the amount of warming implied by the<br>current level of emissions is about 02<br>degrees per decade so we have about uh<br>15 years at this rate before we breach 1<br>and a half de um in terms of the the<br>average um climate but it's actually<br>been anomalously warm in the last year<br>um<br>so what accompanies that the way you<br>feel climate change uh in the in the<br>next decades is primarily through<br>extreme events so in New Zealand we've<br>focused quite a lot on um historically<br>on sea level rise and we have a lot of<br>um we actually have<br>our climate science Community is<br>disproportionately geological because<br>New Zealand has a lot of geology uh and<br>so they've tended to go to Antarctica<br>and study eyes sheets and things like<br>this but that's not really the proximate<br>risk um the the the near-term things<br>that are getting us that are Amplified<br>by climate change um are related to<br>extreme weather um so atmospheric Rivers<br>which are um thin filaments of super<br>moist ear coming out of the tropics uh<br>they<br>uh supercharged they because the the<br>parcels of air are warmer you can<br>contain more moisture in them so you get<br>about 10 degree 10% more more water per<br>degree of warming in the atmosphere<br>roughly speaking um there are changes in<br>the Dynamics so you can get um more<br>storms per week which means more rain<br>per week for instance and there's an<br>interplay between these between these<br>sorts of variables um the the the main<br>ones I'd say we are experiencing already<br>um changes and uh heat related events<br>are already um clearly and and really<br>obviously there are heat events that<br>simply wouldn't have existed in a<br>pre-industrial world uh heat waves in<br>North America and other places um heat<br>related stress uh here in New Zealand<br>will be on the Rise um this area<br>actually you have an excellent young<br>scientist in Luke Harrington um here at<br>the University of w who leads Research<br>into this area um and uh and the<br>evidence is that this actually this part<br>of the country may be on the sharp end<br>of the heat related uh issues um extreme<br>rainfall is the other one that we can<br>really see um so you can have too much<br>too much rain and too little rain you<br>can have both of those with climate<br>change just as the distribution of<br>rainfall shifts so you get more dry days<br>but the wheater days the weest days are<br>much weater and then you have the flash<br>flooding and the the heavy downpour<br>events it's a work in progress to say<br>exactly what the um what the<br>anthropogenic signature in events like<br>Gabrielle is but in many parts of the<br>world at least we have strong reasons to<br>think that there's an intensification of<br>the strongest uh hurricanes um due to<br>climate change so so those are kind of<br>the the big ones I think that that that<br>frame the picture but exactly how<br>climate change plays out uh for<br>something like water and a catchment can<br>be also dependent on things like snow<br>melt in the Alps uh as well as sea level<br>rise as well as the actual um rain that<br>falls in that catchment so these<br>compound events and here in New Zealand<br>um we have had a an Endeavor fund<br>program looking at this um this issue of<br>the extreme events and the emergence of<br>climate change over the Last 5 Years<br>we're hoping to bid we are going to bid<br>again for a continuation of that and we<br>welcome interest from anybody who would<br>like to sort of work with us to make<br>sense of um how how you can um best<br>climate Bryce from the insurance<br>industry what's your take uh good<br>morning everyone um from an insurance<br>point of view I think we should probably<br>shouldn't be talking about insurance<br>because actually what we should be<br>talking about is risk and insurance is<br>really just the signal and the risk is<br>the is the cause so we need to be<br>focusing on the cause um and just as<br>we've talked about in many of the other<br>sessions you know we have an<br>infrastructure deficit I think as<br>resilient as new zealanders are<br>individually and personally we have a<br>resilience deficit in the country<br>um so it's quite clear from what da was<br>saying you know warming climate coupled<br>with our development<br>choices uh is going to see more and more<br>homes and businesses put In Harm's Way<br>basically uh and if we continue as we<br>are if we don't start to improve that<br>kind of resilience deficit um people<br>will suffer greater harm and communities<br>will face increasing economic and social<br>costs from<br>disaster um and so we've had<br>conversation throughout a number of<br>sessions about being really clear about<br>outcomes and this might be a slightly<br>fuzzy one but I think a key outcome is<br>keeping people safe um we might want to<br>Define that a lot more clearly and I and<br>I know U Brian's got thoughts around<br>that um but we do that by reducing the<br>extent to which they're exposed to some<br>of these events and reducing their<br>vulnerability to their impacts and we<br>need to do that not just for the climate<br>hazards uh we also need to De for all<br>the hazards to be face the geophysical<br>ones as<br>well um look the economic and social<br>costs of these things are pretty huge um<br>but weirdly it's not something we<br>routinely rigorously kind of measure or<br>collect so it's one of these things<br>we're not measuring it how the hell are<br>we actually managing it so you know if<br>people want to start thinking about what<br>is the TR true cost of these uh events<br>that's a very important piece of data we<br>need we know from an insurance point of<br>view um last 20 years $44 billion in<br>claims related to Natural hazards that's<br>all of them you know earthquakes and and<br>climate related ones um science is a bit<br>fuzzy on this but you could estimate the<br>total economic cost at somewhere around<br>$200 billion um what's that that's about<br>4.3% of GDP on average a year um what's<br>that equivalent to well some of the<br>numbers that Carly had up here this<br>morning that's about what we spend on<br>education it's about what we spend on<br>superannuation uh we wrap a lot of<br>thinking and a lot of structure around<br>how we manage those things uh we're not<br>doing that necessarily for the hazard to<br>be face um we do have let's not be all<br>doom and gloom we have a pretty well<br>established way of managing our hazards<br>it's evolving um there's lots of works<br>on there's there's tons of new<br>initiatives just got to look at the<br>national adaptation plan it's a whole<br>slew of things that we were were kind of<br>doing but I'm actually not sure it's<br>enough um to keep Pace with the growing<br>risk um you know individually the<br>different parts of that suffer from all<br>sorts of challenges you know some of<br>it's funding some of it's Focus some of<br>it's about underlying capability uh but<br>overall I think our approach is too<br>siloed and It suffers from a lack of<br>coordination and a lack of really clear<br>targeting on the things that matter um<br>and I think another theme Here is about<br>you know we need to be much more<br>specific about need about outcome about<br>where the investment is and this is a<br>space where we can do that and we can do<br>that quite easily um as an ensur our job<br>is pricing risk you know we measure it<br>we can we can put a number on it and I<br>think that helps us make decisions in<br>the way we manage our business but it's<br>data that can help the country make<br>better decisions about where it<br>invests um and I believe that while<br>everyone agrees that managing these<br>hazards is really important I just don't<br>think we kind of agree it's important<br>enough to make the decisions to make a<br>difference um because we kind of and I<br>think there's an attitudinal issue here<br>we we we kind of oscillate between<br>surprise and shock when events occur and<br>complacency when they<br>don't um and we're almost fatalistic at<br>times about this which leads us to<br>emphasize you know response Readiness<br>and response um and we don't pay enough<br>attention I think Brian you probably<br>talk about this about the recovery side<br>of things and we don't pay enough<br>attention to the risk reduction side of<br>things so we need to put some bookends<br>on our standard approach um and I think<br>if you ask me what we need to do I think<br>activities needed in four areas we need<br>it's around leadership it's around<br>knowledge it's around investment it's<br>around practices you know we need to<br>increase accountability for the risk<br>reduction improve how we measure and<br>Target it uh increase our investment in<br>the infrastructure we need to kind of<br>protect communities increase the<br>investment and better Target the science<br>we do to understanding these hazards um<br>and we need to evolve how we build back<br>better after events and yes we need to<br>see through all the things that we've<br>been talking about RMA reform uh manager<br>treat improvements to the building code<br>they're all part of the solution but I<br>think overall we kind of know what we<br>need to do we're just not doing it and<br>so for me that makes the leadership<br>component of this the most important um<br>ownership and with that the<br>accountability for risk reduction so the<br>ambition and the clarity about what<br>we're trying to achieve uh and the<br>coordination to bring the various parts<br>of the system together um so it's<br>critical I think that we keep people<br>safe and the only way we're going to be<br>able to do that is if we reduce<br>risk thank you Bryce S Brian um C uh<br>just a health warning I'm a very late<br>replacement having got press ganged and<br>to this by Matt so don't have some of<br>the Polish but uh what I'm these are all<br>my thoughts and perspectives they all<br>are very challengeable and I'd encourage<br>you to do so um I'm also conscious that<br>I am guilty of raising issues for which<br>I don't have a shrink wrapped answer but<br>that's sort of part of where your<br>thinking process needs to come to the<br>for so the response to the climate<br>change is upon us and time is of the<br>essence I think the extreme weather<br>events of last year have crystallized in<br>one traumatic moment what we as a<br>community need to<br>address the the prospect of Greater<br>frequency and greater severity means we<br>actually have a number of policy and<br>funding challenges ahead of us and in<br>reality I don't think we have a fit forp<br>purpose model to address those we don't<br>have a framework which can guide us<br>although the human factor and ingenuity<br>in the moment is still unbelievable in<br>something as a community we can be<br>really proud of if we don't modify our<br>approach to understand risk we Face<br>ongoing loss to infrastructure and the<br>potential for loss of<br>life what did the severe weather events<br>of last year show us well in my view a<br>number of things and that we need to<br>address to safeguard our way of life<br>first and foremost we don't have a<br>sustainable funding model we've made a<br>virtue of our recovery and not of our<br>preparedness and we need to shift<br>funding from the bottom of the cliff to<br>much closer to the top essentially we<br>have a p as we go we're paying for<br>traumatic events out of our annual pnl<br>and we're not actually providing in a<br>systemic way the way we think about<br>insurance we we put aside so much a year<br>so you know when we have a response we<br>do really really well but frankly it's<br>not sustainable the current funders<br>central and local government are just<br>unable to continue to fund it that way<br>and I suggest that we need to find a<br>different model as I said is it an eqc<br>version<br>two is it intergenerational debt these<br>are all issues in front of us in<br>addition to the funding we need to begin<br>to address some pretty basic things such<br>as and as Bryce has said we need a<br>really clear understanding of risk and<br>what a natural Hazard is I was sort of<br>surprised when I got involved last year<br>working with local government and the<br>insurance companies that we don't<br>actually have a common view of that so<br>if we don't have a degree of commonality<br>and I'm not arguing for centralization<br>here by the way but actually something<br>like that is pretty basic so you know<br>what is the role of insurance in that<br>because at the moment the government has<br>became a default insurer um not<br>something it necessarily chose to do but<br>it has become that and that is not very<br>wise in a financial sense we also need<br>to think about decisions on land use uh<br>these are all essentially local<br>decisions but where we build and where<br>we inhabit is pretty<br>fundamental um you know I think of<br>something like when we got engaged with<br>uh the group in Oakland the council<br>their data set about where flood planes<br>were and likelihood of damage was<br>exceptional but actually when opposed to<br>them so how come we allowed people to<br>build well that data wasn't used to<br>inform a final consenting decision<br>because other factors came in the need<br>for housing the need for development now<br>those inhabitants who bought those<br>houses did they know what they're in for<br>arguably it was in section 27b part Z of<br>the limb um so you know we we actually<br>need to elevate this and have a far<br>greater level of transparency and that<br>goes to my third point in addition to<br>understanding risk we do need a common<br>data set that's made available I know<br>it's naive but informed decisions are<br>often the best decisions you can make so<br>if we've got data let's use it and let's<br>have The Bravery you know do citizens<br>really understand the risk they face and<br>what they need to do you know Allison<br>referred earlier to the good we need<br>good data and I think that is a<br>non-negotiable the fourth thing we need<br>to think about roles and<br>responsibilities the role of government<br>is really important but they can't do it<br>alone and we seem to have this sort of<br>an emergencies let's look to the top and<br>see where the money is going to come<br>from and and it's it's good but actually<br>as as we face into climate change this<br>is more than government this is about<br>business it's about community and it is<br>about indiv individuals and so we need<br>to think through the institutional<br>arrangements and be really clear where<br>decision rights ultimately are because<br>although I'm talking about this as<br>clinical it's not as deeply emotional<br>when you actually begin to challenge<br>somebody about where they can live and<br>their safety you know you have to be<br>respectful the last thing is what is the<br>role of insurance and I'm not here<br>necessarily to speak on behalf of the<br>insurance companies but we have for<br>decades in Generations use Insurance to<br>manage risk but due to economic<br>circumstances it's clear a number of<br>people un unable to do that so what as a<br>community are we going to do I think you<br>know Jim buer referenced last night the<br>need for social cohesion and if you know<br>a lot of the events of last year fell<br>disproportionately on those who were<br>most socially disadvantaged you know we<br>actually have to confront that as a<br>society and work our way through it so<br>as I said more questions than answers I<br>am encouraged by Carol and treasury they<br>are beginning to face into this um but<br>this is going to take really strong<br>policy and political leadership and you<br>as a group have a role in contributing<br>to that we literally can't cut we just<br>can't kick this down the road anymore<br>and we actually have to confront it we<br>have many strengths as a country and we<br>experienced those last year but we have<br>a lot to learn from recent events and<br>now we need to have the courage to apply<br>those learnings to what we do next and<br>how they're going to inform our<br>decisions avoidance is not a strategy in<br>the face of what we need to confront<br>thank<br>you thank you s<br>Brian all right we to start I'm going to<br>actually stay a little bit with you<br>Brian and and Bryce so let's double<br>click<br>on this notion of the anniversary and<br>what we've learned out of the experience<br>here what has been the hardest element<br>of that you you spoke about a couple of<br>things but for the audience in the room<br>why does it matter to Define what a<br>hazard is where have some of those<br>decision rights been challenging as<br>we've sought to rebuild in the Hawks ban<br>and elsewhere and also what were the<br>things that might seem a bit obvious now<br>that had we known two years ago 10 years<br>years ago we'd say gosh that was mad you<br>why hadn't we done this it cost a<br>billion dollars now it would have cost<br>10 million before help us understand<br>some of what we've learned since last<br>events<br>um look I think we learned again the<br>lesson of how tragic these things can be<br>I think we can't avoid that issue you<br>know we saw like in the west coast and<br>um with Westport repeated floods<br>um these things are deeply traumatic and<br>I think we need to learn that lesson<br>because repeat events are are corrosive<br>not only on on the community on its<br>economy but on the people themselves so<br>you know let's not you know that's not a<br>new lesson but that's a lesson we have<br>to remember and take with us because at<br>the end of the day this is this is about<br>people um I think another thing we need<br>to kind of take out of this is is<br>this sense that um these things are<br>unexpected or shocking or surprising um<br>these things do happen they can happen<br>you know there's massive volatility that<br>already exists within within our climate<br>within our hazards and so as rare and as<br>shocking as these events are they were<br>easily expected right so we know these<br>things can happen and so we really<br>should be planning for these things um<br>and so some of what we saw there was was<br>just the result that it it just exceeded<br>design standards in a way you know the<br>Hawks Bay had had paid a lot of really<br>great attention to the their flood<br>management uh it just got whacked by an<br>exceptional event uh a bigger event than<br>than perhaps where they had designed for<br>so I think there's an interesting lesson<br>in that about what are we designing for<br>and I think that's that's kind of come<br>out of this uh for us we need to be much<br>much clearer about what's the level of<br>safety we actually need and want to<br>design for and I think that's where what<br>you're saying to Brian about how do we<br>start to bring these different<br>perspectives together to have a common<br>view about what we will work towards in<br>terms of levels of safety levels of<br>design where we build houses what<br>performance we build our flood levies to<br>that's a lesson we need to take out of<br>that out of this thank you and I might<br>there's a<br>really there's a very interesting it to<br>play with infrastructure here which I'm<br>going to come back to in a minute so<br>Brian what what what did you learn uh<br>well I learned um human beings are<br>incredibly resilient and do great things<br>so you know none of my comments or<br>criticisms of that but you know what<br>Bryce said a lot of what happened was<br>probably able to be<br>foreseen if we wanted to be really<br>clinical about it because it had<br>actually happened<br>before years ago and so you know we've<br>we've got into a virtuous cycle where we<br>probably assume you once in our lifetime<br>one of these events might happen we'll<br>just rebuild and then we'll we'll be<br>okay for 50 or 60 years that that's not<br>going to be the reality of our future so<br>we actually have to design with a quite<br>different climatic thing ahead of us and<br>I think in in respect of climate change<br>we spent a lot of time thinking about<br>sea level rise and I'm not for one<br>moment suggesting it's not important but<br>actually the really important thing is<br>water management and catchment that's<br>where we got and so on the very first<br>discussion we had um it sounds a bit<br>novel but we actually facilitated a<br>session between the insurance<br>companies and local authorities in Hook<br>Bay to actually begin to try and<br>converge over what hazard and risk look<br>like and it was really high convergence<br>but that had never<br>happened<br>and you think well how<br>like why would that be so that's why you<br>know a reference we've got to be really<br>clear how do we get the best information<br>which I think is a a non-negotiable<br>starting point and then apply it to the<br>way we think about infrastructure and<br>design standards you know we have huge<br>design standards for<br>earthquakes where are those design<br>standards for<br>floods you know we have a lot of<br>obligations on company directors and for<br>health and safety about taking all<br>reasonable and practicable steps to<br>safeguard people what so we appli that<br>to the decisions of local government<br>particularly what would that look like<br>so you know the these are all things<br>that you know the policy Frameworks that<br>I think we need to adapt to and create<br>over the next five years those are the<br>at the heart of the<br>issues I think jump on a I think you<br>know we used to um um Zone land um sub<br>you know consent it build it Finance it<br>ensure it and it used to flow it flows<br>in that order and and and that used to<br>be fine it used to work um and even if<br>there were differences and in an<br>attitude about the level of risk and<br>what's acceptable or not it was never<br>that bad we kind of broadly got it right<br>but I think the world is changing and<br>the hazards are changing and so that<br>that uh ability to kind of deal with<br>different is is is getting narrower and<br>narrower and so we do need that common<br>view of risk you do not want a bank and<br>insurer and a council being honored on<br>on the different page because that just<br>creates the very risk it crystallizes<br>the risk we have about financial Retreat<br>um we and so you're right there was it's<br>there's 76 councils or whatever it is<br>that's very difficult for us to all get<br>around so you know while we do like<br>decisions made locally because they<br>understand it and eventually they have<br>to be because you're talking about<br>infrastructure and attachment for<br>example a much more consistent something<br>driven at a national level about what we<br>find acceptable or not is is an<br>important thing we need to fil and and<br>when we do this we have to remember it's<br>fundamental that people have confidence<br>in where they live it's sort of almost a<br>basic human right that you know you feel<br>safe in your own home and there are<br>people who now live in hooks Bay and in<br>Oakland who have lost that confidence<br>and that is a really bad outcome for<br>societ leaving aside any financial<br>implications of<br>it we're coming back to that in just a<br>minute because I'm fascinated on how<br>this is going to play out and the<br>implications of some of that Clarity<br>because they could be challenging Dave<br>across to you let's zoom<br>out we're we're in a recovery phase from<br>Something That We're hearing we're going<br>to be doing a lot more of preparedness<br>or<br>recovery can you give us your take on<br>the global picture because this isn't<br>just New Zealand um what's going to<br>happen in some of those other places due<br>to weather and the flow on effect of<br>weather or sea level and the rest of it<br>that you're anticipating yeah so a lot<br>of the world is a lot worse off in terms<br>of impact than New Zealand um there are<br>places like um the sahal in um uh in<br>Africa where um they may well um<br>face problems growing food at all or<br>much at all um in the next 20 or 30 or<br>40 years and those that will act as a as<br>a massive social stress for places that<br>are already badly governed um and so<br>there'll be a lot of the world that that<br>faces uh massive challenges we tend in<br>our in our Focus here in New Zealand um<br>to spend a lot of time talking about the<br>Pacific Islands but um there's 600<br>million people in Southeast Asia and<br>environs around here um usually near<br>low-lying rivers like the meong and the<br>Brahma putro and others as well um and<br>they may well face internal and external<br>migratory pressure uh in response to a<br>change in climate too um we um you know<br>we also you know we sell food into<br>markets um those markets will<br>undoubtedly be affected by by commodity<br>price shocks related to climate change<br>at some point that may be good for us or<br>bad for us in any given year um but a<br>lot of the political energy in climate<br>change debates and I think this is<br>especially true in in in Wellington uh<br>goes on um mitigation rather than<br>adaptation uh and when when you talk<br>when I've talked to counselors City<br>councilors or or or MPS we often end up<br>talking mitigation uh in in the in uh<br>central government it's often about<br>agriculture or the ETS and in local<br>government it's often about things like<br>cycle waste a lot of political heat um<br>goes on that and and actually less I I<br>fear that sucks some of the oxygen out<br>of the discussions around what we need<br>to do to plan soft Solutions rather to<br>have sort of soft modes of failure when<br>we get unprecedented events rather than<br>hard modes of failure and what I mean by<br>that is so to take an example from the<br>United States um New Orleans had a<br>massive pretty catastrophic flood in the<br>20s<br>1920s um and uh uh acting against his<br>principles um Calvin cage had this<br>interstate Levy system set up uh and and<br>Louisiana um built up the the river so<br>that um so that it would stay within the<br>channels up to some point they then<br>consented housing on the low-lying areas<br>because they were covered now uh and and<br>uh that there was variable insurance<br>across that across that market but when<br>it next flooded um you had a very hard<br>mode of failure because all of a sudden<br>the river you know you just can't really<br>fight water when gravity is involved um<br>and and so there was a large death toll<br>with that and there was there was major<br>problems but having<br>consented having been under the illusion<br>they had dealt with the risk and they<br>may have dealt with the risk had it been<br>had the statistics been stationary but<br>because they had a change in climate<br>they didn't deal with the risk they then<br>they then had lay it upon themselves an<br>additional uh additional really hard<br>rapidly evolving risk when the when the<br>Banks's over topped so how do we so as<br>well as the issues around governance who<br>Bears the risk is it that you know how<br>much do insurers Banks private owners um<br>businesses in the local community local<br>government and central government all<br>beer of adaptation decisions you also<br>want to be making sure that you have<br>modes of um of of failure that don't<br>jeopardize lives and I think I think<br>that needs to be built into this as well<br>and the more we end up arguing kind kind<br>of pointlessly in my view about<br>mitigation targets and that that becomes<br>the main thing people want to talk about<br>the less intellectual depth you apply to<br>this<br>problem it's huge and it's<br>um you know people are familiar with uh<br>humans inability to distinguish around<br>large numbers but we had a long<br>discussion about demographics yesterday<br>and whether we've had net inflows of 100<br>or 200,000 people but when you say<br>there's 600 million people in our<br>neighborhood who might not be able to<br>live where they're going to live uh<br>there's no scenario I can see where<br>we're not looking at Mass migration and<br>there's no way that that won't affect<br>what we're doing in some sense and I I<br>don't I think we're a little blind and<br>often to to having that conversation we<br>we tend to think of the Pacific rather<br>than Asia Pacific um but and I think<br>whatever strategy we come up with for<br>thinking about um our obligations for<br>the International Community in that<br>regard will have to be generic I don't<br>think it'll be convincing to people in<br>those neighborhoods to say well this the<br>Pacific's really a thing and you guys<br>aren't they'll go we just as close why<br>um so but but but hard infrastructure is<br>not the only I'm going to be a real rare<br>of sunshine here hard infrastructure is<br>not the only thing going on so there was<br>a heat wave in the summer of 2003 in in<br>Europe that where there were 80,000 or<br>something like that excess um deaths<br>epidemiologically speaking which means<br>that the deaths were brought forward by<br>a year mostly elderly people and it was<br>a really anomalously hot summer um and<br>it would have been a one in 250y year<br>event in in in a pre-industrial climate<br>or something like that by the 2040s<br>that'll be a one and twoe<br>event um Europe is fortunately we<br>learned a people in Europe um and and<br>planners on climate change learned a lot<br>about how to deal with that and what<br>advice to give about those kind of heat<br>stresses um to go outside to to be in<br>green spaces at night where it's it's<br>cooler um sadly a lot of people uh<br>elderly people turn the fan on but shut<br>the windows because they didn't like the<br>insects coming in but of course all<br>they're doing thermodynamically is<br>creating an additional heat Source um<br>and so so there are things people can do<br>autonomously to adapt to those those<br>sorts of things but but those kind of<br>risks aren't even part of the<br>conversation here yeah no no there's<br>somebody in the room be thinking about<br>getting into the heat pump business um<br>can I just comment that something David<br>just said um the reference to one and<br>250 is that that was something that<br>became really clear in Hook spay is when<br>people hear one in 100 years they think<br>it is one in 100 years not they don't<br>think of it as frequency and even I mean<br>it sounds really really basic but you<br>know we need to talk much more the<br>frequency of these things they'll be<br>much more frequent they won't be 100<br>years so that it's be it's not beyond<br>your lifetime which I think has<br>influenced just and in in this notion<br>that one in 100 anything beyond one in<br>100 is means safe from a planning point<br>of view and anything below means or<br>watch out<br>is is the wrong way to think about this<br>right so so the difference the<br>difference between a one and 100 Year<br>event or 1 and 250 year event a catchman<br>uh what that actually means for you<br>depends on the catchment right that<br>could mean a depth of water that goes<br>from 4 in to 5 in right nuisance<br>flooding to nuisance flooding or it<br>could go from 4 in to 4<br>met which means houses completely lost<br>and people die so understanding the the<br>range of in the language of the return<br>periods and understanding what that<br>actually looks like and our exposure to<br>the different<br>is really important and so we need to<br>change the way we think about this we<br>need to go do we want water in people's<br>homes sounds like a bad idea because<br>once it gets over the floorboards you're<br>gone from having a small amount of<br>damage to probably a couple hundred<br>thousand worth of damage we should<br>probably avoid that that's a good thing<br>so how do we start thinking about that<br>as a basis for how we make planning and<br>consenting decisions so there there are<br>some questions here around how we might<br>price Insurance differently and so<br>on when<br>when you spoke sir Brian about the need<br>to get on the same page what's a hazard<br>is this a flood plane you know should<br>you build a house there or not so we've<br>got incredible data in some places I've<br>seen some of the Oakland data um I can<br>imagine you look at that and say gosh we<br>if we had known that we might have done<br>things differently we know it now we get<br>on the same page a homeowner finds out<br>that's right that be in the flood plane<br>or the water's going to channel down<br>this way let's play that out okay it's<br>what's the average house price in Orland<br>it's a million dollars what is actually<br>going to happen here around property<br>values in equity and accountability for<br>not just the decisions going forward I<br>can see enormous social cohesion risks<br>if one side of the road finds out that<br>they're virtually uninhabitable not now<br>but the one in 100 risk might be coming<br>sooner how is that going to play out let<br>me<br>Sid that pass quickly through the hands<br>of the first five into the wing um<br>that's the million dollar question I<br>think you know it's we were part of a of<br>the um Ministry for the environment's<br>working group on manag r Treat and this<br>is one of the the the key questions and<br>this is why I think you know having a<br>more we can't address this in a peac<br>meal way right we we need to be thinking<br>about how we get people out how we start<br>to manage these things not just or we<br>need to change some planning rules or we<br>need to do more investment in<br>infrastructure we need to kind of think<br>about this much more systemically so<br>that we can have some of those answers<br>up our sleeves and there there's there's<br>different ideas that people have in<br>terms of how you might do you know buy<br>and Lease back sort of things so you can<br>start to kind of you know maintain<br>people's people's value um but we if we<br>don't try and solve the problem in the<br>right way we're going to crystallize the<br>very losses that we are worried about<br>creating yeah I I mean I don't think we<br>have an answer for<br>yeah there is no known answer at this<br>point what I think we know as a a<br>community is this is something we're<br>going to have to face into and as I said<br>we don't have the policy<br>framework to do it yet but it's going to<br>require really strong policy leadership<br>and political leadership because you<br>you're confronting the way people live<br>and how they feel about being safe and<br>the value of their investment which for<br>the majority you know the house is the<br>Cornerstone foundation for most people's<br>wealth and you're just in a flick of a<br>decision potentially going to negatively<br>impact that that that's very confronting<br>we do have<br>some we should have some optimism<br>because New Zealand has shown in the<br>face of many things it has the ability<br>to actually modify and adapt and and you<br>got to believe in that and I and I<br>personally do believe in that that you<br>know if if people can have confidence<br>then we can move forward but denying is<br>where the problem is where we think oh<br>it'll it'll come right it won't come<br>right unless there is conscious and<br>deliberate interventions one one one of<br>the really important things um which<br>goes to a point around political bravery<br>is uh we need to start drawing some<br>lines and lines on maps are not popular<br>things but we need to draw a a line in<br>time and say we now know enough to know<br>how to make good decisions about where<br>we build and develop right so so we<br>can't can't we can't kind of go oh yeah<br>if if you know anything 10 years ago<br>we're not going to support uh we can't<br>do that because that's just catching<br>people up but we can set a line on the<br>future that says in five years time you<br>should know make some better decisions<br>because all we're doing by perpetuating<br>the way we work now is building up a<br>bigger and bigger problem in high Hazard<br>areas that we're going to have to deal<br>with through some manager can I stay on<br>you price for just a moment yeah there's<br>I think one of the things that's lurking<br>in the back of this and some of these<br>Dynamics<br>is the price of insurance and then<br>therefore is this place you know<br>economically insurable you know it might<br>be insurable at some level but it's you<br>know it doesn't work out economically<br>can you just give us a one minute<br>snapshot ofur the insurance market and<br>also the role of reinsurance I was<br>chatting with uh um Jim this morning and<br>um if you were looking about allocating<br>your insurance funds at a Global<br>Perspective the a place with a nickname<br>called the shaky Isles isn't Maybe where<br>you go so give us that picture yeah um<br>um your premium let's talk about a Home<br>Premium right so about 40% of that is on<br>average is probably taxes um in the form<br>of you know GST and financial services<br>and EC so ignore ignore that that's just<br>kind of comes at us there's a chunk of<br>it which is um reinsurance costs and so<br>just as you have insur we have an insur<br>we have a panel of these things um and<br>what we do is when the loss is hit a<br>certain level we have an agreement that<br>we lay that loss off to the the global<br>reinsurance market and typically in New<br>Zealand we've used that for large<br>earthquake risk uh there is a an element<br>of that which is about climate risks uh<br>and that's becoming a more you know more<br>important part of it but fundamentally<br>we have these things because earthquakes<br>can cost us as a country tens of<br>billions of dollars and weather usually<br>doesn't um<br>then we have the competive um premium<br>which is about the losses that we expect<br>to incur um and retain ourselves on our<br>own pnl and balance sheet and and what<br>we're thinking about there is on an<br>average year what would we expect to be<br>paying to you know out in your CL and so<br>we got models we got data we got<br>experience that helps form that uh and<br>then we' you know got our operating<br>costs um so a lot of what we're doing is<br>is just pricing the risk that we EXP to<br>see on an annual basis the reinsurance<br>Market's really interesting and your<br>your point about this you know<br>traditionally um we we tend not to think<br>about that um as as as homeowners but<br>the cost of and the availability of that<br>reinsurance is is is yes partly about<br>what we have here and you know their<br>confidence in how well we're managing<br>that risk as a country and how well we<br>are managing that risk that we take on<br>as an insurer but we're also exposed to<br>all the other events in the world so<br>from a reinsurance point of view yes New<br>Zealand the shake yours you'd wonder why<br>but what really drives the costs and in<br>the globally the last four years been<br>over hundred billion dollars worth of<br>losses I think in the reinsurance<br>industry they're driven by large storms<br>and large floods in Europe large storms<br>in in in the US and and in Asia and so<br>those global events uh impact re<br>insurance which impacts our pricing to<br>no no yeah hard to explain the entire<br>Global Insurance system in the one<br>minute I gave you can you um I'm going<br>to I said I'd come back to infrastruct I<br>will again it's got an insurance element<br>but we heard about what we're going to<br>have to build I drove in this morning on<br>the road from Cambridge and looked at<br>some bridges as I drove under them and<br>looked at some cell phone towers and<br>thought are we now going into a world<br>where every one of those needs an extra<br>30% of concrete steel Heights but<br>because we have to build for a more you<br>know a building like this if we were<br>building it again are we going to have<br>to build for more extreme events and<br>therefore the infrastructure challenge<br>we're looking at funding is actually 20<br>to 30% larger than even what we think is<br>unsustainable now because we actually<br>just have to build for these Dave what's<br>your take um I don't know I think in<br>some places um I can imagine you will to<br>double down and others you know<br>hopefully uh you won't and one of the<br>things we're hoping to do is get a bit<br>handle on on where the most vulnerable<br>parts of New Zealand's infrastructure<br>are so we can kind of provide an you<br>know a list in effective hotpots um<br>there are some probably quite simple<br>things you can do to buy down future<br>risk like not having big stands of<br>carbon forests which might which are<br>more likely to experience fire risk than<br>they would have been in the past near<br>critical infrastructure like roads and<br>power lines and things like that so that<br>there are probably things you can do to<br>buy down some of those risks so it's not<br>all big Capital outlays but some of it<br>will be no doubt I think some of it's<br>actually<br>um we shouldn't just think about this as<br>a future infrastructure problem um or<br>future infrastructure challenge because<br>we've got shortfalls just as we've got<br>shortfalls across a whole range of<br>infrastructure some of the ones that we<br>rely on around managing flood risks and<br>catchments and things like that already<br>have that shortfall they they It suffers<br>from the same problem that all of our<br>infrastructure suffers from and I think<br>there's some really good work by uh<br>Regional government uh that they've done<br>to kind of try and enumerate that it's<br>it's like we're 100 million short a year<br>to kind of maintain and and upkeep our<br>flood infrastructure to the standard<br>that we understand now you know for the<br>climate impacts we're expecting now so<br>we've already got a we're kind of behind<br>the outall already on this and so you<br>know that's one of the things we need to<br>do we need to find a way to start<br>investing in that um so we can protect<br>what we've already got for the risks we<br>already have can I we we're going to run<br>out of time can I but I'll give you one<br>last chance in a moment so theme of the<br>conference briefing to the incoming<br>government um so Brian I asked you to<br>join the panel the last so you'll get<br>the those time to think this through and<br>I'm going to start at Dave's end as well<br>um what would you like to see over and I<br>won't call it this government it's over<br>the next two three terms of government<br>what Dave would you like to see if we<br>were on the stage again in 9 years time<br>6 years time what do you want to look<br>back<br>on um I'd like to think we can get a<br>coherent uh assessment of of how<br>extremes are changing um I'd like to<br>think that we um would<br>be better able to understand and manage<br>the political Dynamics because it is a a<br>a a game of kind of risk Hot Potato um<br>and the unique thing that central<br>government can do is set the rules for<br>all the other players um and so I think<br>if we if we understand those Dynamics<br>and we manage them at at multiple layers<br>um that would be a a step in the right<br>direction I think one of the one of the<br>problems with drawing lines on maps is<br>that the science people go and talk to<br>midlevel council people midlevel Council<br>people do their thing and then it gets<br>blocked at the political level above<br>there so so understanding those Dynamics<br>and creating you know decision- making<br>systems that are are more able to deal<br>with this kind of rapidly evolving<br>problem would be my main<br>thing thank you<br>ryce um I think it comes back to what I<br>was saying before<br>I you know managing these risks is kind<br>of a a horizontal problem that at the<br>moment we're trying to solve through a<br>whole bunch of verticals right we have<br>some governance stuff we have some<br>science stuff that we throw at we have<br>some land use planning stuff and some<br>infrastructure and some emergency<br>management and we kind of have all these<br>silos trying to solve this horizontal<br>problem and surprise surprise it's not<br>working as well as it needs to um so the<br>thing that I think we actually need is<br>is is the leadership to and to to wrap<br>around that um you<br>know there are multiple ministers with<br>responsibilties here I would like to see<br>one minister with responsibility for<br>this you know senior kitchen cabinet<br>minister that's going to put their arms<br>around this and actually drive solutions<br>if we start to do things like that and<br>have an agency that's going to<br>coordinate have a clear strategy around<br>this you know some of those basic<br>governance stuff will start to drive a<br>lot of the change that we need that's<br>the big kind of strategic Earth um<br>there's a laundry list of more specific<br>ones but leave I'll leave it there no I<br>I<br>I we could talk about this for several<br>hours without uh fully solving it but<br>thanks<br>sabron yeah I I probably my advice would<br>be um this all feels a bit overwhelming<br>and it's not you have to break this down<br>into some component part with a degree<br>of alignment I I think as a basic first<br>step we should Rule aign now between<br>what we do in the future and what we've<br>got now because I think the solutions<br>are slightly different but let's use the<br>learnings to stop repeating the mistakes<br>that we we know are there and I think<br>the role of government actually is not<br>to Blink in the eye of complexity take<br>the people explain the what and the why<br>but my last bit to them was please deal<br>with the emotional Dimension to this<br>this is you know we have to do it for<br>people not to<br>them very wise words all right look uh I<br>could have gone on for several hours uh<br>on that one but thank you to all three<br>of you for bringing your experience and<br>knowledge into this so put your hands<br>panel good to go yep thank<br>you we've got our materials all right<br>thanks<br>d</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
