accurate.</p><p>afternoon everyone we'd like to welcome<br>you back for our<br>please<br>so we've got two more sessions this<br>afternoon um before we uh before we<br>break for the day um we're taking a<br>little bit of a change of Direction in<br>this session from the previous session<br>which of course was that that<br>fascinating um exploration of social<br>investment and all of the different<br>things that that would mean we're moving<br>now on to<br>um onto a session on trade dealing with<br>trade in a divided world uh this is<br>going to be a fantastic session I can<br>assure you we've got um we've got the a<br>team of panelists right here in front of<br>you our first speaker on this topic is<br>going to be bangali vitales he is the<br>deputy secretary trade and economic at<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and<br>trade uh he's a hugely experienced um<br>govern official and uh we're we're<br>really delighted to welcome him along to<br>provide some input into this panel our<br>second speaker is M mikich Mia her<br>affiliation is listed as University of<br>wau but she has much broader experience<br>than that indeed um until 2021 she was<br>the director of trade Innovation and<br>investment at uncap in Bangkok so huge<br>experience particularly in the Asian<br>region uh and we're delighted that she's<br>a research associate with us here at w<br>University and really helping to build<br>our trade policy expertise and our third<br>um panelist is my colleague Professor<br>Jason Mika uh Jason has particular<br>expertise in indigenous trade he's a<br>fairly new um member of our staff at w<br>management school but he has really<br>added a huge amount to what we're able<br>to do in this area of trade policy<br>particularly with respect to indigenous<br>trade and I'd have to say that he's very<br>much leading leading the Frontiers in<br>that area both nationally in New Zealand<br>but also internationally so we really<br>have got a wonderful team of panelists<br>uh I'm going to move straight over and<br>ask them to have their five minutes of<br>opening remarks um no need to clap after<br>each one thanks we'll go straight into<br>the discussion afterwards and you I know<br>that you'll want to but you'll you can<br>save your applause for the end don't<br>forget those slido questions send them<br>through and we'll be working through<br>those uh once they've had the the<br>initial remarks go very<br>much<br>so look what a great uh what a great<br>topic trade in divided World um which I<br>would say is trade in a dividing World<br>um and I want to speak in three parts<br>first of all to sketch some of the<br>context and to leave you with the<br>thought that the golden weather as it<br>was for New Zealand trade policy is well<br>and truly over the second is to describe<br>what our responses and the strategy that<br>we're going to adopt now to deal with<br>this divided dividing uh world and<br>navigate the end of that golden weather<br>and then finally I want to make some<br>concluding remarks in particular to<br>leave you the thought that we have a<br>plan that we have agency internationally<br>even as a small state and as a trading<br>Nation it is critical that we deliver uh<br>on those elements uh that I'm going to<br>describe so in terms of that context um<br>some of you may have heard me speak<br>before about the the golden weather<br>period for New Zealand trade policy<br>rules that were enforcable that brought<br>agricultural trade into the rules-based<br>trading system uh protectionism<br>declining and a strong social license<br>both in New Zealand and internationally<br>supportive of trade policy as a key<br>driver of economic growth those<br>assumptions are no longer uh ones that<br>we can hold protectionism is rising uh<br>the rules are now fragmented broken and<br>many of the big powers are flouting<br>those rules quite<br>deliberately and the social license if<br>you're in any doubt about how<br>challenging the social license is today<br>just look at what's happening in Europe<br>right now so those challenges that we<br>Face are now compounded by by the<br>geopolitics uh we have the tensions<br>between the major Powers even the<br>Pacific has now become contested space<br>in a way that we've not been used to uh<br>globally we have uh a key challenge to<br>face which I've never faced in my career<br>which is we don't have us leadership in<br>trade policy anymore and we have a much<br>more muscular China and if you're in any<br>doubt about how muscular China can be<br>just ask Australian wine exporters<br>Australian B exporters Australian Co<br>exporters who were and Australian<br>crayfish exporters who were cut off<br>overnight because of a perceived misstep<br>by Australian uh by the Australian<br>government so that is a fundamental<br>non-trivial change to the way we've<br>thought about the world and on top of<br>that we have of course the existential<br>challenge of climate change we have<br>increasing concern in that social<br>license space about the environmental<br>effects of trade uh the impact on uh<br>trade and labor and labor standards all<br>of these things are part of the<br>contextual environment that we're going<br>to need to think about and how we we<br>navigate that and that brings me to the<br>response so we know that the new<br>government has given us a target a clear<br>objective of doubling exports over the<br>next 10 years and we're gearing up<br>across the economy because this is going<br>to it's not going to be just something<br>that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can<br>deliver uh by itself it's going to<br>require a full economy press to deliver<br>on that um very significant um objective<br>but there are some key things things<br>that that my organization is going to be<br>focused on five things the first is<br>going to be uh we're going to be very<br>focused on supporting New Zealand<br>exporters internationally to break down<br>these emerging protectionist barriers<br>that are emerging so non-tariff barriers<br>will be a key Focus uh of the work that<br>my group does as we take this forward<br>and we know there are literally billions<br>of dollars locked up a recent estimate<br>suggested that in the Asia Pacific<br>region alone uh there are more than $16<br>billion doar worth of non-ar VAR is<br>affecting New Zealand's agricultural<br>trade<br>only we're also going to get better at<br>utilizing the trade agreements that we<br>negotiate we're going to make sure that<br>the $1.8 billion of additional exports<br>that the EU New Zealand FDA is supposed<br>to deliver that we actually capitalize<br>on that because we do know that 40% of a<br>trade agreement's value can be lost<br>through poor implementation so we're<br>very focused on that piece uh as well<br>and we're going to be negotiating<br>agreements government's given us a clear<br>OB objective of negotiating a free trade<br>agreement with India that's clearly<br>going to be a major objective and that's<br>going to require a cross-government<br>strategy the involvement of business and<br>other communities and Civil Society to<br>find a way into that negotiation uh with<br>a key partner and we know that<br>Australia's already struck a deal we<br>know that there are competitiveness<br>effects there in sheet meat in wine in<br>horiculture that we need to uh ensure<br>that we uh can catch up to that we're<br>also going to be working in the<br>institutions across uh the region and<br>internationally the oecd Apec the<br>indopacific economic framework where<br>both India and the United States are<br>present those are the norm building<br>institutions that support the<br>establishment of the kinds of rules that<br>we need to see uh reemerge uh after this<br>sort of period of fra fragmentation uh<br>and tension that we that we currently<br>see and the final area that we work on<br>is the architecture that's about the<br>World Trade Organization that's about<br>cptpp and the expansion of cptpp so last<br>year was a tremendous year year for New<br>Zealand we were in the chair the United<br>Kingdom has now joined the agreement and<br>this year we're going to be looking at<br>who else uh we can bring into the<br>agreement so CPTV becomes a vital part<br>of our architecture and this graph is<br>designed this is my only graph this<br>graph is designed to show you what our<br>strategy is Here China critical economic<br>partner but it is worth remembering that<br>we actually export more to cbtb Partners<br>and now that the United Kingdom has has<br>um join cptpp there's an even greater uh<br>number of our exports go to cptpp plus<br>the UK If you add in Azan which is<br>essentially a story of Indonesia then<br>you've got an even greater you can see<br>what we're trying to do here is hedge<br>our risk is manage that by negotiating<br>these trade agreements that create new<br>opportunities for business and we hope<br>that those businesses will take a look<br>at those opportunities and think about<br>how their own diversification uh risk<br>management needs to proceed that brings<br>me to my conclusion which is yes yes the<br>golden weather is well and truly over<br>for New Zealand trade policy but that<br>does not mean that we are helpless in<br>the face of the big challenges that we<br>face out there we have agency and the<br>key to that agency is not only the cross<br>agency the cross economy work that we do<br>but internationally we need to be in the<br>small rooms where the big decisions are<br>made there's 164 members of the World<br>Trade Organization but when the crunch<br>moment comes the director General will<br>call together 15 to 20 of those Members<br>New Zealand has to be in that group<br>we do that by having a brand of being<br>creative constructive interested and<br>interesting that's the critical part<br>that gets us in that<br>room and we've already had a success<br>Minister mlay has been appointed as the<br>vice chair of the WTO ministerial that<br>starts in about a week and a half that's<br>a critical moment it means we'll be in<br>the room that is how we defend and<br>protect our national interest and that<br>is what how we are going to achieve the<br>very um stretch goals that the<br>government has um has uh presented Ed us<br>with so thank you very much and I look<br>forward to your questions thank you very<br>much for that intro<br>Mia<br>sorry well um hello<br>everyone um if you need to Define<br>2024 and you don't want to do it in<br>terms of um Taylor Swift era concerts<br>then you will Define it in terms of<br>uncertainty and wherever you look<br>whether it is in terms of what was just<br>mentioned the outcome of the ministerial<br>conference number<br>13 or with the election uh that are<br>coming up in so many countries that are<br>actually taking 40% of global GDP the<br>social uh resentments and unrests that<br>we were speak speaking about before it<br>is uncertainty but what is not<br>uncertain is that our world is getting<br>divided it is getting<br>fragmented and it is getting<br>fragmented uh in a very fast way in a<br>quick way the way that we really did not<br>see it coming and when you look um at<br>the the science of that I think trade is<br>definitely the the best tool uh through<br>which that fragmentation is shown so by<br>tracking for example the trade that is<br>trade flows that are happening between<br>the countries in the political uh block<br>and the countries between the<br>blocks the 2023 has uh been noted as the<br>slowdown in trade but the trade was<br>falling much quicker actually twice as<br>quick between the countries in belonging<br>to different blocks than in the<br>countries that belong to the same<br>block then what was even more visible<br>was the trade head issues or the trade<br>flows were difficult in so-called<br>sensitive sectors for National Security<br>chemicals uh different type of uh it uh<br>Machinery as well as uh low carbon<br>technology what we also noted was that<br>FDI was segmenting with request with<br>with regards to these political blocks<br>us China uh the trade did not fall as<br>much as some uh people expected but<br>indeed China is not anymore the largest<br>trading partner of us it is Mexico and<br>so we saw many uh trade flows being<br>rerooted not anymore going directly from<br>China to the destinations because China<br>was the largest trading partners of most<br>of the countries in the world uh but<br>they now rerooted through various other<br>Southeast Asian countries some of the<br>Eastern European Central Asian countries<br>and of course some of the Latin American<br>countries what we also noted is that the<br>spending on Military has increased and<br>of course um this is what creat creates<br>this chilling feeling um in the in the<br>world and I was<br>recently uh listening to um the head of<br>IMF who was commenting on her<br>experiences from the Cold War number one<br>that we had from the 50s to the<br>1980s I was I would say in the bre you<br>know quotation marks privilege to live<br>through part of that cold war as as well<br>but she said believe me it was called<br>behind the other side of the curtain and<br>I can tell you that it was so um we<br>really need<br>to think very carefully about this<br>fragmentation and to think about<br>the likelihood that the world will be<br>for the longer term entering Another<br>Cold War Cold War number two what is<br>different now as opposed to uh last<br>century cold war is that nowadays<br>countries are through the global value<br>chains much more actually connected to<br>the cost of decoupling and the<br>fragmentation will be higher but also is<br>that the certainty about who is<br>belonging to which block is not as high<br>as it was in the last century and it is<br>movable and shiftable and so that that<br>increases the cost even further now let<br>me in the REM remaining I hope two<br>minutes or one minute I just address the<br>topic of trade<br>policy um because trade policy is also<br>changing as the world is changing and I<br>think many people still would try to<br>believe that trade policy is<br>about increasing exports and reducing<br>Imports and that we have for for<br>everything else we have a Master Card<br>but it's not right trade was never about<br>actually just increasing trade flows or<br>reducing some trade flows it<br>was long time ago called engine of<br>growth creating different and better<br>living standards for people and then<br>through time and in the current time we<br>are actually seeing it as an instrument<br>of driving different goals or values<br>than just increasing trade<br>flows it is a driver of a different<br>social ideological and if you wish<br>strategic issues we now talk about<br>multi-purpose trade policy and it is the<br>trade policy that is now sort of linked<br>with having to deliver the the<br>objectives that are related to improving<br>living standards of various marginalized<br>groups or delivering National Security<br>or helping with mitigating climate<br>change so how do we do that uh it's a<br>complex thing we obviously uh cannot<br>only rely on just picking the same<br>trading partners the same trade trading<br>pro products that we have or the way we<br>trade we have to change the way we do<br>things and I think in the rest of our<br>panel we will be discussing how we can<br>you uh I guess um for me<br>um uh my focus my interest is really<br>around uh I can't tell the weather so I<br>don't know if it's golden or not but uh<br>uh when Vali mentioned muscular China I<br>was thinking of Arnold sorena versus luo<br>and I guess uh for me my focus is really<br>around uh indigenous trade and the<br>opportunity uh for mildy and Indigenous<br>firms and communities to participate in<br>trade and to benefit from it so if uh if<br>we're thinking about expanding trade uh<br>within the International Community with<br>new and different partners as well as<br>existing Partners uh then uh my focus is<br>on how can we ensure that Marty<br>Enterprises are right there uh<br>participating in those opportunities to<br>uh deliver what they have to offer the<br>world uh in terms of goods and services<br>but in a way that makes sense for Mari<br>and Indigenous firms us M and Indigenous<br>values uh knowledges and practices that<br>make sense for our Fen for our lands our<br>way our Waters and our communities our<br>far and I was just really uh pleased to<br>hear some of the cordal this morning<br>around uh investing in Faro potential uh<br>because if we're going to invest in<br>indigenous trade and trade international<br>trade and its expansion generally what<br>difference does that make for<br>Faro how is Fino well-being improved as<br>a result of us uh engaging in<br>international trade with anyone uh and<br>how do we know and who knows and what<br>difference does that make so those are<br>some really important questions for me<br>my focus is around is at the smaller<br>level is around the small businesses the<br>small to medium m Enterprises and I have<br>to acknowledge all of the uh the m and<br>Indigenous uh Business Leaders who have<br>who have really carved a pathway Way<br>Forward for us to participate in<br>international trade uh Tracy hopa from<br>Federation of M<br>authorities uh n tomana from the e<br>cheers uh also Chris eny from Tata now<br>cheered by H McGregor of wakatu<br>incorporation uh and also have to<br>acknowledge Alo who are fighting for Mar<br>and Indigenous rights the protection of<br>Mari and Indigenous knowledge in terms<br>of the products the services the<br>processes uh that uh that are part of<br>international trade and that's nuk fak<br>is one of the organizations who is<br>leading that work p and also Mo<br>man so for me it's a real uh it's a<br>privilege really to contribute and build<br>on all of that work and to work with<br>them uh one of the ways in which we're<br>doing that is engaging in<br>research so uh last year we put in a bid<br>to MB uh so this is your money and my<br>taxpayers money uh an Endeavor research<br>program called to H H now to h hoko<br>means trade in the mai language uh and<br>to exchange to give and take uh and we<br>were very fortunate to receive uh $14.9<br>million over 5 years plus GST takes it<br>up to about 17 mil uh so what we're<br>trying to understand there is how we can<br>indigenize trade policy and let me me<br>say this oecd World Trade Organization<br>Apec aen all trying to figure out what<br>what is indigenous trade and how can we<br>engage with it and support it and all of<br>these countries internationally uh they<br>have different relationships for their<br>indigenous communities their indigenous<br>peoples and they're looking to us you<br>know for what are we doing and so it's<br>really important that we do a good job<br>on that research program it has one main<br>focus how do we uh I guess<br>enable<br>manamu you know which is tribal autonomy<br>Mighty autonomy uh through indigenous<br>trade so that our far are better off is<br>wellbeing so it's not enough just to uh<br>do more business internationally and<br>sell more goods and services but what<br>difference does that make for Faro<br>wellbeing way order Mighty word for<br>wellbeing who the mighty word for<br>benefits so how does trade translate in<br>terms of of benefits and well-being for<br>Alano but also climate change climate<br>resilience how do we look after our fenu<br>our why and our communities in terms of<br>what's going on with<br>Pap so uh some big expectations on that<br>research program luckily we've got<br>people like uh Anna and Mia who are part<br>of the research program so there's three<br>key aims of<br>it one is indigenizing trade policy uh<br>and just trying to understand just<br>imagine and this is the way I explain it<br>just imagine if we lock ourselves at the<br>M eye for a week and we think about what<br>would trade policy look like if we<br>designed it from a mild and Indigenous<br>worldview and then come out the other<br>end after a W uh what would it look like<br>uh would it look like what we have now<br>or something else something better and<br>uh the second research aim is uh<br>measuring indigenous trade so one of the<br>challenges of indigenous trade is you<br>can't see it in the data we've got a bit<br>of data thanks to Stats NZ around might<br>Authority exports but it's really hard<br>to see indigenous trade data inside the<br>trade that's done<br>globally and so uh Anna in introduced us<br>to her mate her mates over in puru<br>University so anyone wants to do<br>economic modeling on trade they go to<br>puru university uh to uh database called<br>gtep so gtep is part of our our research<br>program help us to see the indigenous<br>trade data<br>uh inside uh al la but also other<br>countries as well third<br>aim is enabling indigenous trade and<br>this is the area that most interests me<br>in terms of supporting our Mari and<br>Indigenous firms to do business<br>internationally uh and to be successful<br>in doing so uh and underpinned the whole<br>thing is underpinned by m indigenous<br>knowledge and how we can integrate that<br>and what we<br>do Gilda gild Jason thank you very much<br>to uh um you can see what wealth of<br>expertise we we've got here um and some<br>kind of worrying notes of pessimism<br>there but it was good to add on that<br>optimistic note that we're going to make<br>some real progress in the Indigenous<br>trade area at least the question I'd<br>like to start with is actually a<br>question that I think all of the<br>panelists will will perhaps like to<br>address perhaps in different ways if the<br>world is getting more fragmented which<br>certainly me and and Bali you you were<br>talking about<br>does it mean that we need to collaborate<br>better within New Zealand and in<br>particular a sub question is there a<br>role for government industrial<br>collaboration on some sort of industrial<br>policy and this came through in the<br>agricultural session earlier on today as<br>well and we didn't get to really dig<br>into the picking winners and the<br>industrial policy there but I'm not sure<br>if our trade experts want to comment on<br>that but certainly do we need this more<br>collaborative approach in in New<br>Zealand given that we've got such a<br>fragmented and increasing L fragmented<br>World Mia you're going to start are you<br>well look I I wish I could say well<br>forget about this fragmented world and<br>just enjoy nice collaboration with the<br>New Zealand unfortunately New Zealand<br>depends on being in in the global<br>markets so we need to find a way to<br>operate in the fragmented world and I<br>think what Wali was talking about the<br>the way we responding to is is really a<br>good way we need to remain present in<br>the multilateral<br>uh fora uh particularly WTO and we need<br>to ensure that our creativity and um uh<br>I think the the the way we we approach<br>collaboration through<br>selecting the the the countries that uh<br>and I hate to use the term likeminded<br>but that have uh the share values and uh<br>shared objectives as New Zealand with<br>respect to how to use trade policy for<br>improving quality of growth rather than<br>just quantity of growth uh and<br>collaborate more through that and show<br>and successes at that and as we have we<br>have seen through various examples that<br>already New Zealand has taken part in<br>other countries pick up and then they<br>want to join us so this uh definitely<br>Remains the main strategy but of course<br>we need to work better internally uh and<br>I think strengthening uh the domestic<br>economy and improving competitiveness<br>and we have heard so many things great<br>things this morning about what needs to<br>be done really to um to to strengthen um<br>the en environment in which firms<br>operate right is is one big task right<br>including also not to just just rely on<br>on tax policies to fix everything but<br>actually to invest differently uh in<br>productivity in technology in how do we<br>do business and uh that is two track<br>that we have to to take so<br>internationally and domestically that<br>Prosper if I can just add to that uh I<br>guess the thing for me is uh when you<br>think about uh the mar economy last time<br>we measured it uh Bill measured it it<br>was you know 68 billion uh but it's<br>still small and there's still you know<br>there's still a need to uh for M<br>Enterprises in particular to collaborate<br>and in different Industries and sectors<br>collaboration clustering amongst M<br>Enterprises whether that's in the<br>primary sector fishery Seafood uh and<br>other areas food and beverage uh that's<br>definitely a strategy for the M economy<br>because collectively even at the M<br>economy level we're too small so we've<br>got to collaborate now the other side of<br>collaboration is collaboration between<br>Marty and non-mar Enterprises within<br>Industries in which Al is is really good<br>you know our Agri Tech our Agri business<br>uh Digital Services is coming along uh<br>and so all of our industry and Business<br>Leaders who are leading those firms uh<br>need to think about well who are the<br>mildy and Indigenous firms within our<br>cluster within their industry are they<br>part of uh the direction the uh and the<br>the effort that needs to go on in terms<br>of working together across Industries<br>and within Industries to compete<br>globally so I think a a huge effort in<br>needed thanks uh yeah great question um<br>May maybe to make two observations one<br>about the domestic and one about the<br>international on on the domestic side<br>um uh I I certainly see see the value of<br>collaboration I'm I'm a little bit wey<br>of things that start to Edge into<br>subsidies and so on um I me we we've got<br>a a terrific reputation internationally<br>of not going down that path and Having<br>learned some bitter lessons from the 70s<br>and 80s so so I think where I could see<br>that greater collaboration is certainly<br>around the infrastructure piece so the<br>transport system the delivery to the<br>ports have we thought enough about how<br>that connectivity is working and is that<br>really um doing enough if we're going to<br>set this if we're going to achieve this<br>doubling export Target is the<br>infrastructure really fit for purpose<br>and that I think is one of the things<br>that we really do need to focus on is<br>getting that right the other thing and I<br>I've deliberately put this in the<br>domestic economy piece is have we done<br>enough with the single economic Market<br>with<br>Australia we often take that simply for<br>granted here is this fantastic single<br>economic Market that we have with<br>Australia what is its future we've just<br>had its 40y year anniversary last year<br>what do we want it to look like in 10 20<br>30 years and if you look out across the<br>world and this divided world you see an<br>aan Regional economic Community Emer<br>over the next 10 to 20 years what's our<br>relationship going to be to there and I<br>don't mean New Zealand's relationship I<br>mean the single economic Market's<br>relationship what are the things that<br>we've learned so well out of the work<br>that we've done um with Australia Mutual<br>recognition uh not creating new super<br>infrastructure uh Ally Europe but<br>instead this very practical Focus way<br>that has driven the growth in our two<br>economies um is there scope to think<br>about the relationship that we're going<br>to have with the emerging asan Regional<br>economic Community that's my domestic<br>observation my my International<br>observation is that collaboration piece<br>um including uh with Mari uh a key part<br>of that that happens on Shore is<br>understanding better where the interest<br>lies both the commercial and um uh uh<br>the sort of uh the protection of um<br>indigenous knowledge uh data sovereignty<br>questions and if you look at what we did<br>with the EU in the EU Free Trade<br>Agreement you see both elements at play<br>uh the better information that we had<br>because of our engagement with Mari and<br>all of the people that that Jason<br>mentioned are the people that we work<br>with all the time and I personally um<br>speak to them myself that information<br>that we received meant that we got much<br>better outcomes for the Mari economy but<br>also for the New Zealand economy the<br>elimination of the Tariff the 22% tariff<br>on muscles into Europe meant that for<br>the first time when we get this<br>agreement uh enters into Force for the<br>first time New Zealand muscle exporters<br>will be competing for the first time<br>ever on playing field with our main<br>competitor at the moment we account for<br>about 11% of the EU Market on muscles<br>the Chileans dominate exports nearly<br>83% of the market is taken up by the<br>Chile they've had nine years of a free<br>trade agreement with the EU for the<br>first time we will have a Level Playing<br>Field and I expect there'll be a real<br>explosion in in in that uh in that trade<br>there um but it's not just as you said<br>it's not just about the commercial<br>aspect so if you think about what we've<br>tried to do in the digital uh chapter<br>with the EU the additional protections<br>built in to protect indigenous data Mari<br>data sovereignty a real concern that the<br>white Tang tribunal pointed out to us<br>that we've looked to incorporate in<br>things so that offshore piece and how we<br>project ourselves those two pieces<br>coming together I think are critical<br>elements of the way in which we need to<br>think about the<br>future thank you very much I'm going to<br>move to a more specific question on<br>trade agreements and uh you can see that<br>uh our Foreign Affairs are in very<br>capable of hands with people like Bali<br>leading uh leading our negotiations but<br>here's a challenging question perhaps<br>for for you on<br>negotiations heard a comment slim but<br>doable to an FDA with<br>India but an FDA with the US is off the<br>table for New<br>Zealand thoughts on this and also<br>thoughts on getting the us to come to<br>the table in terms of being a more<br>genuinely open trading partner<br>irrespective of trade agreements maybe<br>I'll start with you B and you can offer<br>any comments that you'd like to and then<br>we can turn to our other<br>panelists okay so I mean I mean I did<br>talk about the the India FTA and and F<br>first of all There's an opportunity<br>there and if you think about the graph<br>that I tried to to show there about how<br>we build resilience and manage our risk<br>India is a is clearly a critical partner<br>uh in that space um we know that they<br>can do free trade agreements they've<br>done a free trade agreement with<br>Australia I mentioned that there are<br>some competitiveness effects so we we<br>are going to need to to address that so<br>I absolutely do think that's doable we<br>need to find the right um uh way to<br>advance this with India and that<br>requires a cross-government strategy<br>it's not going to be just the Ministry<br>of Foreign Affairs it's going to be uh<br>the trade Minister the science and<br>Innovation Minister it's going to be a<br>cross uh Ministry piece led by the Prime<br>Minister that's going to get us into<br>that in that frame so I absolutely think<br>that that's a uh that's something that<br>we need to be driving for uh and be<br>advancing as part of our kind of the way<br>in which we want us to look um in the<br>very near future sorry your second uh<br>element was so that was the India piece<br>us oh the US yeah okay so there's a very<br>consequential election happening at uh<br>at the end of this year um and so it is<br>very difficult to to kind of forecast<br>and I don't I certainly don't want to do<br>that in this in this forum um but no<br>matter what it is um we know that the<br>United States is a critical partner of<br>ours and even absent an FTA I would note<br>that our trade with the United States<br>has continued to expand it is now our<br>most uh I think our second most<br>important uh market now not withstanding<br>the absence of a a free trade agreement<br>there are things that we need to do it<br>is an objective fact that the United<br>States continues to apply steel and<br>aliminum tariffs against us it's also an<br>objective fact that we joined a case<br>against the United States and the World<br>Trade Organization we won that case but<br>the United States has not brought its<br>regime into compliance sadly so we are<br>in that world that is going to be<br>challenging but we do have touch points<br>and the indopacific economic framework I<br>think is a critical enabler it brings<br>the it keeps the United States in the<br>region engag we're part of that process<br>and regardless of how the election<br>outcome comes we it is in absolutely in<br>our interest that the United States is<br>engaged in the region that we find ways<br>to connect and for me the indopacific<br>economic framework is the way in which<br>we need to think about uh that it does<br>take time uh and we know that because it<br>took more than a decade for us to<br>transform the P4 agreement into the TPP<br>which the United States joined sadly<br>they withdrew uh and then we have cbpp<br>so it is a a case of incremental uh<br>strategic incrementalism if you like uh<br>in the in the case of the United States<br>thanks sorry long no that was great I<br>think covered it all so what we might do<br>is move move away from the trade<br>agreements then and move on to um<br>globalization is it now going backwards<br>or just changing form maybe Jason I<br>might start with you on this one is<br>globalization changing its form you've<br>talked a lot about these new issues in<br>terms of that we need to be aware of but<br>do you think globalization is changing<br>its form or or is it just going<br>backwards well that's a big cop um but I<br>actually want to come back to the<br>question just before that's right um you<br>know international trade from what I can<br>tell uh starts with relationships you<br>know if you've got a relationship with<br>some<br>then you've got an opportunity to have a<br>dialogue about what is the opportunity<br>before us and sometimes it may not work<br>out uh but at least you've got a<br>relationship of trust and openness uh<br>and one of the things around India and<br>also the United States India has over<br>500 tribal indigenous tribes registered<br>they got a legal system recognizing all<br>these tribes so uh India has an<br>indigenous<br>population uh and so<br>has the United States over 500 federally<br>recognized indigenous tribes with uh<br>tribal manamu over there now you know<br>one of the ways in which Marty do<br>business is to establish relationships<br>so rather than see indigenous people and<br>Indigenous trade as a sort of something<br>to add on or add to an agreement is<br>actually use some of the indigenous ways<br>of forming relationships uh with people<br>to create an environment where we can<br>have an open discussion uh so um you<br>know if there's trade missions and trade<br>policy indigenous people are part of<br>both the design and the delivery of how<br>that occurs I think that's uh that's the<br>point there about<br>globalization what I'm going to do<br>actually Bengali wanted to add something<br>in on what you were just talking about<br>and then we'll go back to globalization<br>yeah definitely want you to come back to<br>globalization um I I was just going to<br>add the indigenous partnership for<br>economic cooperation and trade<br>arrangement um that uh that we're in uh<br>Canada Australia and Taiwan are in um<br>that is a fabulous point of Engagement<br>with the United States um and at the ape<br>meeting uh last year at um at the<br>leaders meeting uh there was uh<br>Ambassador Tai uh the US trade<br>representative hosted a meeting with<br>members of the indigenous partnership<br>for economic cooperation and trade<br>Arrangement um it was the only<br>engagement that she had uh with a group<br>of non um apic uh related structures uh<br>and I thought that was a really<br>interesting that they chose that and<br>that she was involved in that she spent<br>over an hour and half uh with the group<br>uh and I think that was a really and by<br>and by the way this is not just<br>government Representatives at the table<br>this also included um Tracy HOA and<br>Peter tip as<br>well because there's that and perhaps<br>that's a nice lead back into that<br>globalization because of course this is<br>an area where perhaps we can take things<br>forward Mia yeah well backwards or is it<br>just changing no it's actually not going<br>backwards it's just changing the shape<br>because we have increase in uh<br>dependency between the countries but<br>they are now getting into Regional sort<br>of relationships right and so uh I don't<br>think uh I don't think it's really<br>shape okay I'm going to um come back to<br>you Vali on this one I guess it comes<br>from your your graph that you put up<br>there scenario planning what actually<br>would happen to New Zealand if China<br>shut its door to New Zealand in a<br>practical<br>sense where would our exports go what<br>would happen to our<br>economy so I mean clearly um that would<br>be one of the big fundamental challenges<br>and we know we've learned the lessons um<br>from Australia's experience um and we've<br>done a lot of work with the Australians<br>to understand how they dealt with with<br>that and how they addressed that for<br>guess I guess the key lesson that came<br>out of the Australian experience was<br>that actually the rules kind of worked<br>yes the door was shut in China but they<br>then exported and I take the example of<br>wine the wine that they used so wine was<br>Australia's number one market because<br>they're of red wine um China's not a big<br>market for New Zealand wine because we<br>produce largely white wine um what<br>happened was the Australian red found<br>its way into the European and the US<br>markets and the US and the EU moved<br>their product into um uh into China so<br>the market kind of reg and the rules<br>worked because at that point uh the<br>system ensured that uh you know the<br>United States was prepared to let those<br>uh this increase from Australia happen<br>and from the EU because they were also<br>moving their own product so I do think<br>that that's a very important lesson uh<br>there is that uh those relationships<br>those markets and the way in which<br>business needs to be thinking about risk<br>because in the end the government can't<br>cross- subsidize business's risk here uh<br>what we've got to do is be saying to<br>people Hey listen this is what's<br>happened and you need to be aware of<br>what's happened and that is what<br>happened to Australia people need to be<br>thinking about that and what we're<br>looking to negotiate is new<br>opportunities for you so the UK Free<br>Trade Agreement the EU Free Trade<br>Agreement the expansion of cptpp uh the<br>digital economy partnership agreement<br>these are all ways of creating<br>optionality for New Zealand businesses<br>intern<br>we can't say you need to be here or you<br>need to be here but we can say by the<br>way did you know for the for the first<br>time if you're a lobster if you're a<br>producer of crayfish in New Zealand for<br>the first time you'll be competing on a<br>Level Playing Field in the second most<br>important Market in the world for<br>crayfish and that's Europe China's<br>number one Europe's number two you could<br>never look at Europe because the Tariff<br>was 15% and the Canadians were trading<br>in at zero so you simply couldn't<br>compete because the Canadians are your<br>major competitor now for the first time<br>you will have that opportunity what we<br>hope is that fish exporters crayfish<br>exporters Horticulture exporters they'll<br>look at that market and think about how<br>their risk should be distributed but<br>it's not for me to say where people need<br>to be but it is important that what we<br>do on the government side is we create<br>those opportunities that optionality I'm<br>good at long<br>answers and a very informative answer<br>that really gets us thinking about this<br>in this intersection of of how much we<br>need to Target particular Industries and<br>so on um Jason I'm going to come for<br>another question for you please what do<br>you see as the key differences between<br>indigenous trade and mainstream trade<br>and we'll put quotation marks around the<br>mainstream trade because I I think you<br>might be about to mainstream indigenous<br>trade issues but what do you see the<br>what do you see the the key differences<br>and what are the benefits that New<br>Zealand as a whole can harness if we<br>really uh push the frontiers of<br>indigenous<br>trade yeah I I guess uh there's two<br>parts to that one is um well maybe three<br>uh the first part is uh culture and<br>identity uh so basically identifying as<br>an indigenous person and indigenous<br>values uh focusing on things like f now<br>we all have family relationships we all<br>do uh and for Mai uh they really focus<br>on Fino relationships so family<br>relationships really matter because once<br>you've got those sort of connections<br>then you have a relationship you have a<br>responsibility to look after one another<br>and to uh and to conduct uh business and<br>so one of the key aspects of the<br>differences will be how relationships<br>are formed and the priority that<br>relationships have in in terms of<br>conducting business<br>internationally uh and some of the trade<br>missions that were conducted uh earlier<br>on probably about oh maybe 10 15 years<br>ago now uh Mar culture was at the<br>Forefront of those uh those trade<br>missions to China to other parts in<br>terms of sharing culture sharing values<br>and getting to know one another through<br>Mari culture through Mari Kai H kakia<br>and it wasn't just the M that was<br>singing those songs too a car it was the<br>it was the CEOs of our big companies who<br>really uh understand the value and<br>importance of engaging as people so<br>first and foremost is how you form<br>relationships and do business<br>internationally on the basis of<br>indigenous values the other side of it<br>is in terms of uh the products and<br>services which we produce our very best<br>products and services whether that's<br>Alim one our our Seafood um the<br>entertainment content or whatever it<br>happens to be is infused with mildy and<br>Indigenous knowledge knowledge<br>OFA knowledge of U flora and FAA but<br>also recognizing who owns that stuff and<br>the value of that and where it comes<br>from so that we can tell our story to<br>the world about our indigenous and Marty<br>knowledge and products and processes so<br>uh it's it's part of what we actually<br>have to offer the rest of the world the<br>value that we have here probably the uh<br>I guess the third the third part is um I<br>guess the the way in which Marty<br>Enterprises are formed and why they<br>exist in terms of looking after Faro so<br>when we think about our businesses and<br>why we do business why do we do<br>business it's to feed our farno it's to<br>provide for our families in all the ways<br>that we could think of providing for<br>families in terms of their wellbeing the<br>benefits for Faro whether that's in our<br>rural communities or Urban centers so we<br>need to think about a different way in<br>terms of of of that side of things so<br>those are some asps thanks Jason me just<br>adding one little parallel because it<br>reminds me uh Jason to how we have<br>differentiated between Asian type of<br>doing trade and the Western type of<br>doing trade and you know it was always<br>sort of identified with the miracle way<br>being transactional and only looking at<br>these while the you know in Asia there<br>was a social capital and Trust invested<br>and longevity of relationship and I<br>think that is also applicable very much<br>on how we look an indigenous way of<br>doing<br>trade thanks and M I was going to turn<br>to you with a with another question at<br>this stage as well protectionist<br>measures I know this is something that<br>you give a lot of thought and and feel<br>quite concerned about um protectionist<br>measures that may be implemented uh by<br>other nations that can affect New<br>Zealand whether they're tariffs and<br>non-tariff measures that that Bali was<br>talking about or or other measures um<br>what you know what's what's really the<br>the way of dealing with these increases<br>and protectionist measures from New<br>Zealand's perspective is it trying to<br>push the multilateral approach or do we<br>have to um go with manyi deals you know<br>how can we deal with this<br>increasingly protectionist era that we<br>seem to be uh moving into well that's a<br>difficult question I think but I look<br>obviously protectionism uh affects New<br>Zealand um Traders because they<br>increased the cost and you were<br>mentioning 16 billion uh dollars costs<br>raised through the non-tariff beas it<br>forces us to trade with different<br>markets and all of that is more costly<br>and and therefore less uh income uh<br>domestically uh how do we deal with that<br>yes I think multil you call it gold era<br>uh I'm a strong multilateralist um I<br>think it is definitely something that we<br>have to protect in Safeguard but of<br>course um the the different type of<br>Agreements are valuable as well now if<br>you look at the all the agreements that<br>we have signed right we have actually<br>covered I think 15 agreements uh almost<br>enforce with 60 countries counting all<br>the European Union ones um and all of or<br>most of them are quite comprehensive so<br>what else can you do with this uh big<br>agreements not much you can't add when<br>you look into us and India perhaps then<br>you you have closed the book but what we<br>can explore is what we have been doing<br>is going a little bit more uh sectorally<br>or uh issue based or or measure based<br>and try to deal uh among the countries<br>that are willing to solve these issues<br>uh through the mutual recognition<br>agreements or mini deals that can help<br>us you know some people would um<br>critique that approach because they<br>would say oh we will end up with the<br>many um numbers of little deals it will<br>be chaotic and it will actually increase<br>the cost of doing trade but not<br>necessarily because they can actually be<br>like L together and they can grow into<br>into a bigger deal with with with more<br>countries right uh and they can serve as<br>a as a buffer uh in in the period when<br>we do not have any movements in terms of<br>multilateral agreements uh in these<br>particular areas like services for<br>example yeah I mean can I make mean I<br>agree with you um and I mean the<br>multilateral space is still the best<br>place to deal with subsidies for example<br>which are maor form of protection that<br>really depresses the price and then the<br>return for New Zealand uh exporters um<br>but clearly in the multilateral scene we<br>we've got some big challenges to face<br>that's where the free trade agreements<br>come in and that's where you know we<br>need to be prepared to enforce our<br>rights there and it is actually worth<br>remembering that we've always used the<br>World Trade Organization but the World<br>Trade Organization now no longer has a<br>functioning dispute settlement mechanism<br>so we are forced to look at the free<br>trade agreements and New Zealand almost<br>uniquely outside of the North American<br>Free Trade Agreement uh the<br>usmca um we are one of the first<br>countries to test that new system by<br>taking a case against Canada uh on dairy<br>uh on the way in which they've treated<br>our Dairy um exports um through the CP<br>we're in we prepared to enforce our<br>rights use the rules um and we won that<br>case and Canada is now um trying to find<br>a way to make sure it's as as compliant<br>as possible something we're watching<br>very closely but but my point really is<br>about the fact that we are um we are<br>using the mechanisms that exist then<br>there's we need to be prepared to step<br>up and take a case and enforce our<br>rights we may be a small state but if<br>you cheat us we will use these these<br>rules that we've negotiated you know<br>cbtp took five years to negotiate we<br>want to actually get the return out of<br>that but then I think we also need to<br>think creatively about coalitions uh<br>that we can work together with to push<br>back against barriers we have for<br>example example an agreement on pushing<br>back against non-tariff barers with<br>Chile what would be wrong with expanding<br>that grouping with a larger number of us<br>who face similar barriers in the<br>Horticulture space in uh in fish and<br>seafood working together collaboratively<br>to try to drive that uh clearly<br>Australia is a key partner in that but<br>again we're being forced to think<br>creatively about these challenges that<br>our exporters face and those challenges<br>by the way they have a cost not just on<br>the exporter but in the return back into<br>our economy one in four New Zealand jobs<br>depends on exports almost one in three<br>Mari jobs depends on exports if you're<br>an exporter you're earning 14% more than<br>if you're in an non-exporting comp uh<br>company these and if you're an exporter<br>the drive back into productivity back<br>home here is 32% 32% greater than a<br>non-exporting firm this does matter this<br>is critical for us so if we're seeing<br>people putting up barriers non-tariff<br>barriers subsidies we need to push back<br>against that and we need to also say to<br>people and we're prepared to take a case<br>against you and I tell you what that<br>does have an impact we do feel that the<br>fact that we took a case against Canada<br>has sent a message to others that might<br>be thinking Little Country we can just<br>treat them like this they know that we<br>are prepared to take a case but those<br>things they take excellent lawyers they<br>take resource this isn't a Lobby for<br>more money not really um excellent trade<br>officials but those are the that's right<br>but look we we do need to be thinking<br>about this but can I make One Plea<br>businesses that are out there that might<br>be listening to this you need to let us<br>know if you have a problem please don't<br>Fester out there thinking you're alone<br>we can help there is a cross agency team<br>this is not just the ministry of forign<br>Affairs and trade it's Customs it's NPI<br>it's MB it's tpk we all work together on<br>this and we're very very folks we've got<br>a clear direction from Minister mlay<br>that this is an absolute priority to<br>resolve these non-tariff barriers take<br>us up on it contact us there's no wrong<br>window you can go to our website there's<br>a click there register what your problem<br>is and we will get back to you and<br>will'll develop a strategy to crack it<br>down for<br>you that's one of the examples of the<br>internal collaboration that can help<br>that<br>yeah I'm going to ask a a quick question<br>of you Jason just because we've had lots<br>of indigenous tra there's lots of<br>interest from from people on slider on<br>indigenous trade but I'm going to select<br>one of the ones that's come from our<br>high school students actually it's just<br>a very quick quick question here could<br>mainstream New Zealand trade Industries<br>collaborate with indigenous uh Traders<br>how would this help New Zealand<br>Global image in terms of producing<br>authentic goods and services so I guess<br>the question could um could there be<br>collaboration between indigenous Traders<br>and the rest of New Zealand would this<br>help New Zealand's image absolutely yes<br>yes I mean um there's potential for M<br>and non-mi businesses to collaborate<br>work together uh in sectors in which we<br>are uh both uh involved particularly<br>agre business uh Seafood um so the the<br>main exports for Mar Enterprises at the<br>moment is Seafoods uh seafood and uh<br>dairy products agricultural products uh<br>and to some extent um Services as well<br>uh so uh look I think there's there's<br>great opportunity for collaboration<br>there and uh we've got to sit down as<br>industry leaders Business Leaders and<br>figure out well what is the basis for us<br>to do that uh what is the basis for us<br>to collaborate<br>uh and ensure that we're you know Mighty<br>companies and mighty Business Leaders<br>are part of those industry bodies those<br>Peak industry bodies that are uh backing<br>those Industries to do well<br>internationally and uh so that's one<br>aspect and I think in terms of when we<br>decide when we start going overseas on<br>the trade missions that Mary and nonmi<br>are there you know holding hands you<br>know singing uh together the way the<br>Haka and uh part of<br>our presentation to the world about who<br>we are as a people as a nation so<br>K and we we've got time just well we've<br>got 20 seconds each for a final wrap-up<br>question I was thinking of asking them<br>what they felt most optimistic and most<br>pessimistic about but we've heard such a<br>range of these different things coming<br>through in all of our speakers I'm just<br>going to give them 20 seconds each to to<br>wrap up whatever they would like to wrap<br>up and say whatever they would like to<br>to say on this issue of trade in a<br>divided<br>World Jason let's start with you 20<br>seconds what do you want to say gosh uh<br>20 seconds um I I guess the main thing<br>is to um really sort of uh focus on uh<br>supporting our Marty and and non-mi<br>businesses to work together when we go<br>internationally to do business using<br>indigenous and Mar values forming<br>relationships based
