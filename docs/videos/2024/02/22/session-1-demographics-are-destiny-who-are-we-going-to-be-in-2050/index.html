what we're trying to convince<br>shafali s and myself is the significance<br>of demography and as somebody who's just<br>looked at the long-term plans 21 to 31<br>for New Zealand I've got to say that<br>many authorities have underplayed um the<br>demography that is beginning to emerge<br>so does demography matter absolutely<br>because we're seeing very significant<br>changes occurring in terms of our<br>demography and there are new and<br>exciting possibilities but there are<br>also challenges particularly as this<br>trans transformation begins to change<br>how we live where we organize ourselves<br>how we provide services and<br>infrastructure how we fund those<br>services so if my pitch point it's that<br>these changes are so transformative that<br>we're going to need new and different<br>ways of um of arranging ourselves paying<br>for things and I really want to see<br>is I really want to see a lot more<br>digital literacy and understanding and<br>what we've going to do so what I want to<br>do is just simply at a high level Global<br>level highlight some of the changes that<br>are occurring the first is fertility the<br>important thing here really is the um<br>the ongoing decline of fertility and the<br>fact that we at 1.58 uh births per woman<br>2.1 replacement level we're just about<br>to head into low low fertility<br>territory very different fertility<br>behaviors Ministry of Education say that<br>by 20 30 30,000 fewer children in our<br>education system this is what it looks<br>like internationally the uh this has<br>come from the UN but this is the the<br>graph that shows um fertility and what's<br>happening to it what you'll see there is<br>China which is right down there in terms<br>of low fertility and for us this is the<br>shape of the fertility of our last 50 to<br>70 years so the question for us is what<br>does low fertility mean in New Zealand<br>the second component really is aging and<br>and the rapid aging I've called it hyper<br>and and and Michael Cameron's in the<br>room and I've I've borrowed his term<br>here and used it rather Loosely um but<br>for us what's very significant is the<br>structure of the demography of our<br>societies and so one of the pictures I<br>would say to you is that increasingly<br>not only us but High income societies<br>around the world will be old dominant so<br>there's a tipping Point that's going to<br>come if it's not already and that is<br>that the over 65s outnumber the Zer to<br>14 year olds combined in that is<br>longevity and New Zealand is seeing an<br>ongoing increase in life longevity uh in<br>this country so as we see these aging<br>societies what are we doing in<br>anticipation that they are going to<br>change in the way that they<br>are um I'm going to leave leave it to<br>shafali to talk about this more but I<br>just want to make make the point that at<br>the moment the increase in longevity and<br>life expectancy is not plateauing and as<br>you can see is expected to reach 91 but<br>the issue for us is that the a number of<br>the uh relationships the dependency<br>ratios the entry and exit ratios are<br>beginning to change and as you can see<br>here the number of 15 to 64 year olds<br>compared to the over 65 year olds will<br>go from six to two so what does that<br>mean mean and how we organize this our<br>society and how we pay for things um I'm<br>part of an 18 country uh team that's<br>looking at Super diversity funded out of<br>Max plank uh super diversity at its most<br>simplest is where at least 25% of a<br>population come from immigrant and<br>ethnic minority communities um it is<br>beginning to change but also alongside<br>change societies but alongside that it's<br>beginning to promote some very<br>problematic politics so at the very<br>moment aging societies probably need<br>immigration for all sorts of reasons<br>population growth uh labor market supply<br>uh we are seeing the rise in various<br>parts of the world of anti-immigrant um<br>politics so we like many others are<br>using immigration to top up um labor<br>Supply and of course um the thing that I<br>would point out is that the impact of<br>the last 10 years of our our very high<br>inward migration and net migration has<br>made Oakland the fourth most diverse<br>city in the world we've leap frogged all<br>the Australian cities and we're forth<br>just behind<br>Toronto the final thing I want to to um<br>to note is that when we look internally<br>but when also when we look<br>internationally I think we need to<br>change and think about our languaging<br>and so I've used the word depopulation<br>which is a very confronting term and I<br>was brought up and trained in the 70s<br>and ' 80s when Paul erick's book the<br>population bomb was uh was very<br>influential and that was the essential<br>notion that world population was going<br>to overload the ability of the world to<br>provide for that population as we look<br>out and this is from a un this is a<br>composite from a un report that came out<br>a couple of years ago what we're looking<br>at is a very significant decline in<br>populations or depopulation the UN and<br>and they might be wrong I mean this is a<br>a forecast to 20 00 so for another 80<br>years identifies 23 Nations and you can<br>see a list of some of them there which<br>are going to Harve in terms of their<br>population and then the graph on the<br>right shows the relevant populations and<br>the interesting thing is there because<br>the growth will be subsaharan Africa<br>that China and Nigeria might well be<br>about the same size by that date of<br>201100 so my<br>pictures we like many other societies<br>are beginning to EXP experience a<br>demographic<br>transformation which is going to change<br>how we do things and so really in the<br>context of this economic Forum we really<br>need to factor in much more deliberately<br>we've got good quality data although I<br>would note Len Cook's comment about the<br>ongoing need for that good quality data<br>and the possibility that it might not<br>continue at the level that we've seen in<br>the past but what do we do in this in<br>this environment where diversity aging<br>declining fertility and very different<br>Regional impacts of demography change<br>Kata thank you Paul uh quite a lot on<br>please thank you Paul uh good after<br>afternoon and<br>Kora Paul has given you some very high<br>level insights into uh the uh key some<br>of key demographic trends that are<br>happening across the globe and of course<br>in New Zealand as well I would now like<br>to um dig a bit deeper into what are the<br>key changes that are um likely to happen<br>in New Zealand and what that might mean<br>for us now I think it's really important<br>to point out that uh Mai and Pacifica<br>populations have both had very different<br>demographic Transitions and that aspect<br>continues to affect the present<br>demographic landscape of New Zealand uh<br>so uh for example um both of them have<br>very different age structures so if you<br>look at the pakia population currently<br>the median age of the pakia population<br>sits around 41 years whereas it's only<br>26 years for Mai so that's a massive<br>difference so Mai make up around 177% of<br>our population currently but if you look<br>at the under 15year old age group The<br>tamariki the children uh it's 28% and if<br>you go forward to about 2043 it's going<br>to increase to 32% so in 20 years time<br>close to onethird of our child<br>population in this country is going to<br>be Mai so Mai form a a very um<br>significant share of our regional and<br>national population so it's very<br>different from uh indigenous populations<br>in countries like Australia or Canada or<br>USA here in a New Zealand uh it is very<br>important to have an understanding of<br>the uh Mai population Dynamics uh<br>because that is Central to our Economic<br>Development so let's get a bit more uh<br>GR<br>and uh and look at what this new New<br>Zealand is that Paul is referring<br>to so New Zealand population as you all<br>know is growing and it is expected to<br>grow to around 5.7 Million by<br>243 but the growth rate the rate at<br>which we are growing has been declining<br>and is projected to continue to decline<br>so we are still growing but we are<br>growing at a much slower rate than the<br>past now now if you look at the<br>components of change I'm going to<br>apologize in advance for all the graphs<br>I was told by Matt I shouldn't have too<br>many graphs but I can't tell the story<br>across without including a few of them<br>so this is the components of change so<br>population can change basically because<br>of two things natural increase and net<br>migration so natural increase is<br>basically having more births than deaths<br>in your population now if you look at<br>the black line that's you can see that<br>the natural increase has been declining<br>in New Zealand for quite some time now<br>so we are still have more births than<br>deaths but that is slowly declining and<br>then it comes the Blue Line shows the<br>net migration now migration has always<br>been very volatile in New Zealand it is<br>and it continues to be very volatile so<br>you can<br>uh so and this migration volatility<br>basically is driven by citizens leaving<br>the country and non citizens entering<br>the country so one of them is basically<br>uh and um uh is is as a result of policy<br>and one is simply the economic<br>conditions uh in the country so one<br>thing we all need to take into<br>consideration is that developed<br>countries uh most of the developed<br>countries are in the same aging kind of<br>boat as we are so we are all looking at<br>the same limited pool of skilled<br>migrants from to get into our country so<br>it it is limited and it's not endless so<br>if a country wants to move away from<br>this dependence this Reliance and<br>overseas Talent then we have to then<br>training and uh education play a crucial<br>role in labor force uh in labor<br>Supply Now population growth so in New<br>Zealand is growing overall but it is<br>very unevenly distributed across the<br>country so you have in 20 years time we<br>have N Out of 16 67 territorial<br>authorities across New Zealand which are<br>which are projected to decline in<br>population Paul talked about the de<br>population so we are going to have nine<br>out of ta 67 TI which are going to have<br>lesser number of people than they are<br>now so there is no one siiz fits all<br>model that we can apply in New Zealand<br>we have to be very attuned to what the<br>changes are happening in the local area<br>uh in when it comes to policy and<br>planning so we have to remember that<br>aging driven growth is not the same as<br>youth driven growth so if you look at<br>the graph here New Zealand's population<br>in the next 15 years is expected to<br>increase by 12% but most of that growth<br>is because of the increase in the number<br>of elderly whereas all the younger age<br>groups below 65 are either increasing<br>very marginally or even declining and<br>also remember the aging and the speed of<br>Aging also differs across the country so<br>it's not not same<br>everywhere now structural aging that<br>Paul referred to leads to what we call<br>as demographic crossovers so one of the<br>major crossovers is having more elderly<br>in your population than children so<br>currently 13 out of the 67 T already<br>have had this shift and in another 20<br>years time another 44 are going to<br>follow so we going to have 57 out of the<br>60 7 TI are going to have more elderly<br>in their population than children<br>and then you have another uh major<br>crossover which is more people exiting<br>the workforce than entering the<br>workforce and there we already have uh<br>30 U 50 sorry 50 out of 67 which have<br>already have more exits than entrance<br>into the labor force and another 10 will<br>follow and by 2043 almost all ta 60 out<br>of 67 are going to have more people<br>exiting the workforce than entering<br>now structural aging also differs as I<br>said by spatially it differs spatially<br>so if you look at these A6 pyramids of<br>three very different AG sex structures<br>so you have a place like Hamilton which<br>is relatively young so it still looks<br>like a pyramid and then you have a<br>slightly aging population in Cavo which<br>as you can see the narrowing or rectang<br>rectangularization of the eights<br>experiment and then you have a place<br>like Tam coromandel where I'll again use<br>the term maybe hyper aging where you can<br>see it's almost like an upside down<br>pyramid as or as I would not not me I've<br>heard it being called a coffin shaped<br>pyramid which is a bit morbid but it is<br>quite<br>sobering so for uh reasons largely<br>related to the fertility patterns um in<br>the past Mai still structurally are very<br>youthful so if you look at the mai 86<br>structure it still very much looks like<br>a pyramid with a heavy base more<br>proportion of people young Youth and<br>children and same is the case of the<br>Pacifica population but then if you look<br>at the European and the other New<br>Zealander population it's already doing<br>that rectangular rectangular I don't<br>can't get this word right<br>rectangularization so it looks like a<br>sausage shape<br>so Natalie Jackson more than 10 years<br>ago go refer to this uh Mai uh uh Mai<br>demographic dividend and now more and<br>more questions are being raised on this<br>issue in the PES and some of you might<br>have followed the uh Newsroom series by<br>Aaron smil which is again talking about<br>this issue of the mai demographic<br>dividend so it's not only about<br>increasing um access but is also about<br>uh equity and opportunity for because it<br>what is good for the future Mai uh<br>Workforce Development is good for New<br>Workforce uh growing diversity yes we<br>are growing more and more diverse the<br>share of Mai Pacifica and the Asian<br>populations within our population is<br>increasing uh if you look at a place<br>like Oakland which uh which is how which<br>is home to one-third of new zealanders<br>it's growing more and more so even in<br>the South Island again it's diverse in<br>if you look at Oakland for example it's<br>uh growing more and more diverse and by<br>2043 it's no longer going to be a pakha<br>majority so it's a it's a very very<br>different demographic landscape that we<br>are going towards so we have to start<br>thinking about questions like what does<br>this mean in terms of service delivery<br>we uh how does this ethnic diversity um<br>change the demand uh for services how<br>does it challenge the Supply and of<br>course the multiculturalism and the<br>ethnic diversity is also very different<br>uh sub<br>regionally so I'll end with what Paul<br>had started off with which is the<br>importance of demography so it's really<br>important not to oversimplify the uh<br>dynamics of population change it's not<br>just the bottom line of yes the<br>population is increasing or decreasing<br>it's a whole lot of uh things that make<br>up population change it's the<br>composition change it is the spatial<br>distribution it is the trends over time<br>and these are all important facets of<br>population change and demography is an<br>important science uh that and it often<br>requires multidisciplinary contributions<br>to fully understand the complexity of<br>population change and I'll stop there<br>now thank<br>you all right thank you shali uh a lot<br>of uh data and a lot of insight to take<br>in I'm going to um start with one for<br>you Paul and then I'll probably cut<br>across to you and a moment s so starting<br>at the global<br>picture<br>looking the number of countries that are<br>going to Haren<br>population we hear a little bit about<br>the ghost towns in Japan or you know you<br>build a house that immediately loses<br>value because every day there's less<br>people um just talk to us about some of<br>the Dynamics that are going to happen<br>around the world with that and then<br>you've got Nigeria and some of those<br>other<br>Dynamics yes I mean when we look at<br>fertility Decline and remember that 2.1<br>is replacement level then the number of<br>countries that are down at 1 1.2<br>1.3 would be rather larger than you<br>might have anticipated and what's<br>interesting about those is that nearly<br>all of them have tried pratal or<br>policies designed to reverse it and and<br>without failure so I rather jokingly the<br>other day on on on uh on Breakfast<br>Television pointed to Hungary which in<br>2019 said that if you have four more<br>children you don't have to pay income<br>tax and it gets weing out concessions<br>now and it always gets a laugh but in<br>fact it has been unable to change<br>fertility decline in those countries so<br>one of the things we wrote a book<br>there's a number of us in the room who<br>are who contributed to that called<br>rebooting the regions and one of the<br>things we did was we looked at<br>population stagnation and decline in New<br>Zealand's regions and it actually gets<br>it becomes very difficult to talk about<br>that particularly with<br>politicians who do not want to ever<br>mention a word like<br>decline a and I think that's true<br>internationally so if you look at<br>Singapore as an example which has got<br>very low<br>fertility and the Singaporean government<br>is now mandating and trying to insist on<br>people having more<br>children it it's not going to it's not<br>going to succeed we've got nothing to<br>suggest that we'll succeed so one of the<br>things that is going to have to require<br>a major mind shift is what what does a<br>much older population including<br>declining fertility mean for how we<br>operate and it's going to produce new<br>fiscal stresses on States you know there<br>are all sorts of um issues around<br>getting your mind around there can I<br>just finish last year Japan declined by<br>443,000 in one year alone<br>W big numbers can I and I won't spend<br>long on this but just we're looking at<br>that decline population you mentioned<br>you can take away the obligation to pay<br>tax people still won't have kids is the<br>decline driven by people not wanting to<br>have kids it's expensive it's that allow<br>there are more single people is there a<br>biological thing is that the this will<br>be conspiracy theory time is it the cell<br>phones what's the no it's not it's it's<br>it's the growing educational success of<br>of females combined with their labor<br>force participation combined with their<br>um the cost of having children there's<br>something called a baby calculator and<br>the baby calculator in New Zealand<br>estimates that both in direct and<br>indirect cost to bring a child up to the<br>age of 18 in New Zealand is<br>$285,000 and so as you know with<br>millennials and Generation Z they're<br>having to make all of these sorts of<br>calculations do I buy a house do I have<br>children you know those are calculations<br>that I think are made but the it is that<br>female credential uh success and and<br>participation in the labor market which<br>is which is probably the most<br>significant factors when you mentioned<br>that I'm sorry if I look distracted but<br>I've got Twins and I'm I'm thinking<br>about this for myself so of course Sarah<br>you're um in addition to others Sarah<br>you're um you're a practitioner in this<br>space how when you look at the global<br>Trends but also particularly probably<br>chiar's numbers you're working with<br>clients you're working with Regulators<br>how are these being used now or are they<br>being used now what is what's the<br>practical application that's happening<br>at this stage of these kind of numbers<br>yeah I I'd say it's actually a mixed bag<br>you see some really high quality uh work<br>coming out of um um people who are<br>thinking in the demographic area and<br>health for example you'd be quite<br>worried if Health wasn't thinking really<br>deeply about the implications of an aged<br>population um I think also the<br>infrastructure commission have been<br>doing some good work on um the absorba<br>of capacity uh of infrastructure and the<br>demands in particular that those<br>unpredictable levels of migrants um<br>activity have on their infrastructure<br>demands and and they really have<br>identified through that work quite a<br>yawning Gap uh in terms of our<br>absorptive capacity I think from my<br>perspective some of the most interesting<br>work is actually what I would call this<br>um the kind of non-traditional<br>absorptive capacity and there's three<br>things that kind of come to mind<br>assignments I've done to support clients<br>um the first is supporting local<br>authorities who are delivering a lot of<br>housing in New Zealand now local<br>authorities about 80 perent of councils<br>are still delivering housing<br>predominantly uh low<br>uh income retirement housing which you<br>know by all of the um data of my<br>colleagues here is going to be a yawning<br>Gap particularly if house prices um and<br>Home Ownership continues to be Out Of<br>Reach for many and yet many are being<br>pushed to exit those um ownership<br>Arrangements because of uh Financial<br>pressures they're facing in other parts<br>of their Council area so what I'm doing<br>is actually supporting them to actually<br>understand that kind of<br>intergenerational impact of those<br>investment decisions who who else might<br>step in and provide those kind of um<br>housing options for their aging<br>Community uh if if they don't and that's<br>an area where the kind of work that Paul<br>and chiali do is so critical to Quality<br>decisions now that have that<br>intergenerational effect um another area<br>actually and it and it isn't one that<br>leaps to mine readily is actually our um<br>our typically Anglo Centric approach to<br>the development of regulatory<br>intervention in New Zealand so um I uh<br>in my team at Martin Jenkins are often<br>called in to support major New Zealand<br>employers uh but also have given support<br>to The Regulators in the area of um uh<br>worker welfare and migrant exploitation<br>that is that both our regulatory system<br>of protection and also our way to ensure<br>that our supply chains particularly for<br>the brands that are facing an export<br>Market are are free from exploitation of<br>Migrant workers given the sudden influx<br>in temporary migrant workers so<br>understanding demographic shifts uh<br>composition of Workforce um the<br>challenge of English as a second<br>language and understanding uh basic<br>imployment uh minimum standards is is<br>another example of how demography really<br>matters so I'm afraid I could bore uh on<br>this topic um for hours and indeed a<br>whole day so I'll leave it there as some<br>of the examples of the the real value<br>I'm seeing coming through in that<br>demographic work there's a there's an<br>hour between the end of the sessions and<br>dinner and we can Source a whiteboard if<br>you if if people want to dive in um<br>shafar across to you so I'm stitching<br>together some of these we have a<br>population that gets to I think you said<br>it was around 5.7 million around 2043 or<br>so<br>um we've got decline domestic births if<br>you like so that's going to be filled by<br>uh increases in Immigration what does<br>this mean when you look at a system like<br>education we hear at the the later stage<br>of an education system we're often<br>talking about needing to to build more<br>schools recruit more<br>teachers we're going to you also talked<br>about the ethnic makeup of domestic<br>population this is going to be a really<br>different population going through our<br>schools and are we actually going to<br>need less schools or are we going to<br>need more schools that can absorb<br>migrants well Migra sorry migration is<br>as I said is very volatile so we can't<br>really like you you can't really say<br>that it's going to be 300 because we<br>recently had 300 this was<br>250,000 people come in so it's it's it's<br>up and down all the time but yes more<br>schools in the interim and I think it's<br>going to rise and then going to fall<br>because you have this but you do have as<br>I said a young Mai and Pacifica<br>population which is going to be going<br>through the schooling you have these<br>blops but you also have to take into<br>account that uh the workforce is also<br>aging so it's not only about having more<br>schools but you're going to have a you<br>have the teacher in Workforce that is<br>aging you have the service delivery<br>problem also the demand is one side of<br>it but you also have the supply side of<br>it that needs to be taken into account<br>so yes there might be a need for more<br>schools or less schools by depending on<br>the projections but I don't think we can<br>be completely sure about that yes we're<br>going to have more and more migrants<br>coming in that is not a given so who<br>knows what the it's all speculation at<br>the side I think in terms of whether we<br>going to need more schools or less<br>schools right thank you s yeah I think<br>the the example of schools is a great uh<br>one for thinking about um demographic<br>shifts so um shavali is Right<br>immigration settings at the moment are a<br>little unpredictable and obviously the<br>productivity commission did some really<br>good work uh over the last couple of<br>years around the implications of<br>immigration settings for productivity<br>generally but I just reflect with an<br>anecdote if I could for having the the<br>great privilege or perhaps the tortured<br>regret of being on the Board of Trustees<br>of my local Primary School uh in central<br>Oakland where um the poor old principal<br>hadn't really ever come across a<br>governor like me before um and once we<br>had actually nailed U Marty and Pacific<br>achievement which I had tasked him in<br>his first year as a priority I did say<br>to him right you have this covid period<br>to become and equip yourself to be<br>really excellent and as English as a<br>second language because that is your<br>demographic future and with 40% of you<br>know ockland going to be Asian by 2043<br>that's something that the schooling<br>system particularly in Oakland needs to<br>be really excellent at so I think that<br>that everyone around this room will be<br>in strategy functions that's why we're<br>here because we think about these big<br>issues and every one of us will have the<br>handle on investment choices and<br>decision making that could really make a<br>difference to Future<br>Generations thank you I that last point<br>I'm going to pick up there was a<br>question in here around housing and<br>absorbing migration and so on but I'm<br>going to broaden that out to housing and<br>broader infrastructure we've got an<br>infrastructure session later on we've<br>talked about agriculture and how do we<br>feed more than 9 billion people around<br>the world but I'm really interested in<br>this up and then down shape uh Paul<br>start with you and others will have<br>views we we're building infrastructure<br>and this is globally but it might be in<br>certain towns within New Zealand but it<br>feels like we might be building it for a<br>period for a town that is then may be<br>abandoned or we might be building houses<br>that we won't need in 50 years time we<br>need them for the next 20 how do we<br>think about some of those infrastructure<br>challenges well I I think it's great<br>that the infrastructure commission has a<br>30-year time Horizon because one of the<br>frustrations I think we would all have<br>and probably all in this room is that<br>very often the political decision making<br>is driven by a three-year cycle so<br>actually getting a a timeline which is<br>more than 5 years 10 years and and<br>spreading it out to the 30 years is I<br>think fundamentally important as an<br>orlander of course we in terms of the<br>provision of services and infrastructure<br>you know we're always in deficit and so<br>when we think about the<br>127,000 net migration gain from 2023 and<br>remembering that at least half of those<br>are going to end of those migrants are<br>going to end up in Oakland we're sort of<br>loading a population increase on a<br>system which is already which is already<br>struggling um there is some interesting<br>work that's being done particularly<br>around the world in terms of the housing<br>market itself what the Brits are doing<br>at the moment is looking at what they<br>called excess bedrooms and it's<br>interesting because the baby boomer<br>generation like myself are probably and<br>I'll use myself are living in a house on<br>the North Shore which has got four<br>bedrooms and and we only use one of<br>those and the question is a is a<br>theoretical one but if you could<br>distribute those excess bedrooms around<br>would you have a housing problem and the<br>and and the British home office have<br>said no it it it it's not a matter of um<br>capacity it's who owns and who uses our<br>existing capacity and so we're building<br>and I just I live above Long Bay beach<br>and there are 3,000 new houses being<br>built in that one development alone and<br>and so you know you just wonder where<br>we're going to go in terms of that<br>long-term projection can I just make one<br>point in terms of s I think the<br>productivity commission did a fantastic<br>job in looking at the issues that<br>immigration creates for this country and<br>some of the possibilities yeah thank you<br>um there's a question come through here<br>again the team at Scots College it's<br>been voted up hope you guys are not<br>voting up your own questions the um it's<br>it's a perennial one uh aging population<br>superannuation and a question about when<br>that kicks in but there's some<br>subtleties in here should we be looking<br>at raing raising the superannuation age<br>and should we be doing that on a blank<br>basis recognizing that different<br>communities have different needs there's<br>a difference between being a knowledge<br>worker and retiring at 65 versus being a<br>a physical worker and time retiring at<br>65 I might start down at your end Sarah<br>but I'll welcome questions from the<br>others yeah<br>um I obviously thought quite deeply<br>about this question and also thought<br>quite carefully about how I would answer<br>it um I had the great privilege actually<br>and it dates me in 2005 as being a<br>senior analyst working in a locked room<br>on the um on the budget uh paper for the<br>introduction of the Kiwi saer scheme um<br>and um and I remember that quite vividly<br>I was probably like any good treasury<br>analyst and there's a few in this room<br>Informer and recovered um I was probably<br>about 26 27 at the time and it was<br>probably still one of the most<br>significant things I've ever done in<br>terms of my contribution to uh New<br>Zealand being a better place um and you<br>know we were worrying about uh how New<br>Zealand was going to afford uh the cost<br>of uh Universal superannuation then and<br>it's still something I think we should<br>be worried about now I mean in 2050 a<br>child born today will be 26 they will be<br>entering into the phase of peak tax<br>revenue<br>productivity uh they are more likely to<br>be Mari Pacific and migrant uh than they<br>are P um so they are the people who will<br>be paying for our retirement I also<br>noted that business New Zealand in fact<br>overnight has has um released a document<br>about the um the critical importance of<br>bipartisanship on some of these<br>substantive demographic driven issues<br>and the retirement commissioner<br>certainly also called for that recently<br>so you can see as a good wal University<br>trained Economist I'm going to sit on<br>the fence on the one hand on the other<br>hand on this issue I think that I worry<br>quite deeply about shortterm term<br>decision making or reactive decision<br>making around superation I think it<br>requires careful and considered thought<br>I think that it is an interplay between<br>eligibility age the role of kiwi sa<br>scheme superannuation generally and<br>eligibility because you're right um<br>blanket rules will disadvantage those<br>that uh may not reach re retirement and<br>who may not um enter retirement with<br>high wealth and in in the current um<br>situation I worry particular for elderly<br>who enter the retirement phase of the<br>years without a home um because our<br>model very much depends on on that<br>assumption thank you I'm um can I can I<br>add to that the retirement commission I<br>think has done an excellent report on<br>setting out the issues and the<br>possibilities I think SAR is right the<br>one thing that the first recommendation<br>is that there should be a long-term<br>political Accord so that we can have a<br>discussion independent of the politics<br>of it and in there is a table which is<br>really um confronting at age 65 a ma<br>male has a life expectancy of 15 years<br>at age 65 a female Asian has a life<br>expectancy of 24 years so there is a<br>huge gap there and what concerns me is<br>that this is one of those areas where we<br>need to renegotiate the social<br>contract very very carefully and at the<br>moment it seems that there's a<br>reluctance to really engage with some of<br>those issues so I hope the retirement<br>Commission report does invite a<br>widespread discussion thank you that's<br>that is confronting I'm I'm going to<br>come back to that point and a point<br>about social cohesion in a moment but<br>before we get to that there's another<br>one that's come through and or passes to<br>usali around the<br>population this is not evenly<br>distributed you know we've got changes<br>but we're talking at a national level<br>what's going to happen and the<br>differences between between our big<br>centers and uh our smaller towns so<br>rural versus Urban how does New Zealand<br>play out in terms of the size of Oakland<br>versus the<br>regions I think the de population that<br>I've been talking about is mostly<br>happening that's a nobra it's happening<br>in the rural areas because rural areas<br>have traditionally always lost uh young<br>people to out migration and I think what<br>they what happens is when these young<br>people leave a rural area they take<br>their productive potential with them<br>which then accelerates the rate of uh<br>aging so I think one of the main things<br>is how do we make uh those areas more<br>attractive for people to stay with<br>because currently all the uh major areas<br>like Oakland Hamilton all the urban<br>areas are don't have the issue of they<br>have people wanting to go and stay there<br>and they they don't have the population<br>the the population issue so I think in<br>going forward we need to start thinking<br>about about how we can make those uh<br>rural areas much more attractive for<br>people to want to go and stay there<br>young people wanting to go there<br>providing more opportunities over there<br>so people would want to go and stay in<br>those<br>areas thank you um and this maybe takes<br>some of that out to a global lens uh and<br>I'll go to you and for this one again<br>when you look at the birth rates and<br>again compare a a Korea or an Italy with<br>Nigeria or other parts of Africa<br>obviously some places are growing some<br>pieces are shrinking what are we going<br>to see around the world in terms of mass<br>movements of people and how might that<br>impact Us in New Zealand either through<br>the arrival of people on our Shores or<br>through uh the geopolitics we'll be<br>dealing with how do you think about some<br>of those big mass mass movements at a<br>global level C can I start I mean I<br>think we've got to rethink our migrant<br>sources so if you look at the current<br>inter arrival of migrants in 23 it's<br>India Philippines and China in that<br>order I I can't see it's um what's<br>called the um what is it called the um<br>uh Lewis Turning Point um China's moved<br>into demographic deficit and I can't see<br>them allowing their best and brightest<br>to migrate to New Zealand in the future<br>whether as International students or as<br>as um as skilled workers so I think one<br>of the things is that the offshore<br>origin and source of our migrants is<br>probably going to have to change and we<br>really haven't apart from South Africa<br>looked at subsaharan Africa as a source<br>of migration it's been very minor and<br>when you look at um Global demographics<br>then we we might need to need to um<br>rethink that in in in quite significant<br>ways um the other thing is of course<br>that all of these aging societies are<br>going to look to migration to top up<br>their labor market supply shortages so<br>again I think places like Canada<br>Australia New Zealand have been very<br>successful with their point system in<br>capturing some of those some of those<br>that talent pool that's out there<br>internationally but whether that will<br>actually uh continue into the future I<br>think is a mute point and needs<br>rethinking I think another thing which I<br>think we all need to an unknown and<br>which is going to affect migration is<br>climate change I think that is something<br>that we do need to keep in mind that yes<br>CL with climate change happening uh it's<br>going to change the migration patterns<br>world Sarah you've worked in<br>government Paul you've just finished a<br>stint in the department of prime<br>minister and cabinet so I might let you<br>have a r of reply on this but Sarah do<br>we need a population policy listen to<br>that do we say look we want to be 8<br>million here's where they're going to<br>come from and these are the skills yeah<br>this is a great question um so I um I am<br>not a a fan of a population policy um<br>because I do see our response our our<br>political economic societal response to<br>demographic shifts as being much more of<br>a dynamic system so I don't think we<br>need a population policy I think we need<br>a full court press um and uh um the<br>reason uh I hold that view is that um<br>population policy where it has been uh<br>conceived overseas often becomes quite<br>reductionist and it focuses on um the<br>more challenging end of policy which is<br>largely around immigration settings and<br>in the context of a kind of global uh<br>Trend towards High degrees of divisive<br>misinformation disinformation and<br>distrust I don't think it would<br>necessarily be<br>um a holy constructive contribution to<br>these really fundamental issues um I am<br>much more a fan of um you know<br>investment in incredibly high quality<br>data um public good research the um the<br>embb funding that went into the um<br>Cadence um work that I know that Paul um<br>in the University demographic Department<br>here at wo were involved in as well was<br>a very important contribution you know I<br>was working in a um in a policy role in<br>Oakland at the time and I was using<br>those research papers um to really<br>create a strong evidence base for some<br>of the policy interventions that I was<br>recommending to government um I think<br>that there is certainly some very<br>challenging structural issues<br>fiscally and the kind of stewardship<br>obligations that were introduced in the<br>changes to the public service um act<br>last year and the introduction<br>introduction of long-term insights<br>briefings which are designed in part to<br>be immune from short-term political<br>influence is a is a good contribution it<br>would be good to have more of that so<br>population policy not so sure about that<br>uh full court press on the full<br>implications of demographic change<br>informed by rigorous evidence<br>absolutely Sarah and I<br>any Sarah and I have fundamentally<br>disagree on this what drives me nuts is<br>that we tend to talk about bits of our<br>demography without joining them together<br>why aren't we having a discussion about<br>the rapid aging declining fertility the<br>the different Regional trajectories in<br>terms of the demography of particular<br>regions rural versus Urban um top half<br>of the north Ireland versus the rest of<br>New Zealand and immigration put together<br>and very often the default position when<br>we talk about demography is IM actually<br>immigration so I'm with SAR on that but<br>we have the capacity now for complex<br>models and what we need I would argue is<br>to have those complex model models<br>beginning to tell us what is happening<br>at a Nuance level at a micro level<br>because I think in terms of demography<br>we often talk about Oakland and we<br>forget about um inago inago yes thank<br>you and and and we can model that and so<br>that we fully understand the complexity<br>and its implications and our policy<br>options and so that's my ple a<br>population policy but underpinned by<br>some very good data we'll meet you for a<br>Spates at the Whiteboard which will be<br>over here at about 520 um all right so<br>look we've got 5 minutes before we're uh<br>rejoined by uh our tax Enthusiast next<br>door can I go down the panel or start at<br>you here and come this way<br>um there's an issue that's behind or<br>maybe a consequence of of a lot of what<br>we're talking about and that's social<br>cohesion we are looking at a very<br>different population run the new New<br>Zealand economics conference Forum 2044<br>this room will look different the<br>students and the university will look<br>different the people walking down Queen<br>Street and the streets of inago will<br>different how do we how do we stay<br>together as a population what does it<br>mean to be a nation or a group of people<br>and what would you like to see so that's<br>all theoretical High stuff in a<br>practical sense what would you like to<br>see from government or from Civic<br>institutions around maintaining social<br>cohesion at a time of vastly different<br>population Sarah and despite the<br>grandiosity of the question we've got<br>four minutes before invaded so yeah so I<br>think that um our absolute strength will<br>come from our diversity and that is what<br>we should really focus on crating um our<br>diversity will be um different<br>differently experienced across the<br>country but it will be um you know we'll<br>have fastest roads to good diversity in<br>our regions and strongest concentrations<br>in our urban areas so that is really<br>important I think we need to I've been<br>sadly doing quite a lot of work on<br>misinformation and disinformation and I<br>am really concerned about um cultural<br>imported values around social cohesion<br>and I think we need to safeguard those<br>and um you know continue to really<br>celebrate what is what is unique about<br>New Zealand thank you shali I think it's<br>uh uh yeah as we are getting more and<br>more diverse but I think the most<br>important thing we all need to keep into<br>account is we have massive uh ethnic and<br>intergenerational inequities in New<br>Zealand and until we address those<br>inequities and are able to uh do<br>something about them we all this is<br>always going to be a challenge to social<br>cohesion if we have so much inequity in<br>our uh all RS it's whether it is health<br>or employment in every aspect of New<br>Zealand if you look there are ethnic and<br>intergenerational inequities and until<br>we address those inequities I think it's<br>always going to be a problem to have a<br>good social<br>cohesion thank you it's fundamental<br>thank you po uh as one of the co-authors<br>of the cabinet paper on social cohesion<br>which cabinet did not want to AAR of I'm<br>a little jaist here um and I and if I<br>had to guess at why cabinet because I<br>wasn't in the room I I think they found<br>it all too much it's it's<br>all-encompassing it's it's it's a really<br>challenging space to be in and yet I<br>think we fundamentally need it and and I<br>would remind you the Royal commission<br>made social cohesion one of the policy<br>priorities after they consider the chis<br>jet shooting so it should be part of our<br>our policy um settings um however as<br>somebody who's just come out of the um<br>dpmc and the the center for countering<br>violent extremism as its director and as<br>a diversity judge I've got to say that<br>the last five years have made social<br>cohesion in this country much more<br>problematic the online world is<br>really very hostile<br>aggressive very shouty and very very<br>threatening to many of our minority<br>communities Jewish Muslim trans our our<br>um our uh teenagers in this country and<br>so I have was caught out by the<br>the impact of social media and of Co and<br>what emerged through Co so suddenly our<br>challenge around social cohesion has<br>become that much more important and that<br>much more challenging thank you we're<br>being rejoined uh by the team so Paul<br>shaali SRA fascinating discussion thank<br>you so much please put your hands<br>together<br>than<br>ni</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
