Lau – PwC.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>speakers so in place of Max who's on<br>your program um we're really delighted<br>that Graham Scott was willing to accept<br>the invitation at extremely short notice<br>so we're extremely grateful to to Graham<br>for been willing to to stand in many of<br>you will know Graham um he probably<br>needs no introduction to most of you but<br>I'll give a very brief one just because<br>you don't have his bio in front of you<br>as you do for our other speakers<br>he was a previous Secretary to New Zeal<br>of New Zealand treasury from 1986 to<br>1993 and those of us that look at<br>economics and economic reform in New<br>Zealand know that that was an absolutely<br>critical time um to be involved in that<br>sort of an agency graah has held various<br>Health leadership a diverse set of roles<br>including in in health since then and<br>he's currently a director of sap so um<br>thank you again grae for being willing<br>to step in at at close to zero notice<br>and we'll really appreciate the insights<br>and wisdom that you'll bring to our<br>discussion um our ladies are still still<br>with us they managed to to get the<br>flights without incident so I'm<br>delighted to introduce um Sandy L from<br>um PWC NZ um specializes in tax policy<br>welcome along here and Professor Lisa<br>Marriot of Victoria University is um our<br>third panelist today so five minutes uh<br>opening comments for each of our three<br>speakers and then we're open for<br>questions um Please be aware that<br>there's a different slido um link for<br>this session to the other session okay<br>so make sure that you're entering your<br>tax questions on the correct slido link<br>when you go to it otherwise it's going<br>to be a wee bit Troublesome for Matt and<br>I when I start asking demography you<br>might have a go at the demography<br>questions and these guys might have a go<br>at the tax questions but if you could<br>enter your questions online uh through<br>the correct link that would be that<br>would be perfect and if you could also<br>so signal if there's a particular person<br>you'd like the question directed at<br>please feel free to signal that and I'll<br>I'll do my best so without further Ado<br>um grae could I ask you to open well<br>thank you Anna can you hear me is that<br>right yeah thank you Anna for inviting<br>me to this uh exciting New Edition of<br>Economist theater Sports you have three<br>minutes on the subject of ta starting<br>now um I'll talk about what I did learn<br>because I was in the center of a major<br>tax reform in New Zealand in the 1980s<br>and what I leared there I mostly haven't<br>unlearned and still think is relevant<br>and so I'll talk about some of those<br>things so as you and others the other<br>speakers here contemplate what running<br>the tax system differently might mean<br>I'd ask you to remember some of those<br>things that we leared last time we did<br>it you're all too young to remember<br>almost all of you just what the tax<br>system was like back in the early 1980s<br>where we had a proliferation of rates on<br>uh that were different across all kinds<br>of things we had sales taxes that<br>accumulated on layers on layers uh we<br>had a tax system that double taxed<br>corporate income uh and a whole lot of<br>other problems that U we had in the<br>system and it wasn't collecting enough<br>money and it was grossly distorting to<br>give you just one example one of the<br>reasons that Sir Robert moldun put a tax<br>on on uh pleasure boats um that wrecked<br>the industry stopped it in its tracks<br>and set it back for years uh was that it<br>wasn't recorded in the<br>CPI and that's the way tax systems were<br>done in those days the F Min the Finance<br>Minister Bob tizard put a prohibitive<br>tax on women's Cosmetics because they<br>thought he thought they were a frivolous<br>luxury um and thank goodness we've left<br>that behind but just I wave that flag<br>just in case anyone's inclined to think<br>we should just load the tax system with<br>a whole lot of things we could end up in<br>a place where you're going to have to<br>have another reform so what did we learn<br>there well those of you who know<br>anything about tax know about the Ramsey<br>rule the basic idea is the perfect tax<br>system is the one that levies the taxes<br>and the places where it'll have the<br>least impact on people's behavior and so<br>why don't we do that well the answer is<br>we don't have the information to do that<br>besides which even if you had it<br>momentarily<br>it moves in other words if you've got<br>somebody who's let's say a professional<br>doctor with a practice and you can<br>probably raise their tax rate con<br>considerably before they reach a point<br>where they say to hell with us I'm going<br>to Australia might take a bit of time<br>but it'll happen so where we ended up<br>back there was a pragmatic solution<br>which was called uh broad bases and low<br>rates and it has a lot going for it<br>because it doesn't assume you have<br>information about tax incidents that<br>you'll never have and it minimizes the<br>effect of unintended side effects which<br>always happen with all taxes and so the<br>lower the taxes the less those are<br>likely to be so there's something to<br>remember my second point is that a lot<br>of the debate and conversation about tax<br>that's taken place in New Zealand in<br>recent times is ideology dressed up as a<br>tax<br>proposal and it will always be thus<br>public policy is about ideology as well<br>as technical analysis but I think in tax<br>it's an fiercely complicated set of<br>analytical techniques that you need to<br>really understand the effects of changes<br>and tax systems uh it isn't something<br>that the ordinary taxi driver or<br>hairdresser intuitively knows there is<br>room for expertise even as though<br>ultimately lead tax experts all have<br>ideological preferences like anyone else<br>but I would suggest that the poisonous<br>impact of<br>postmodernism that's crept into New<br>Zealand as it has in all the great<br>democracies around the world in recent<br>times is pressing the idea that policy<br>analysts and experts generally don't<br>know anything much and that science is<br>just a a kind of Western sociological<br>and ideological idea now if that's true<br>then we might as well close this panel<br>now but I'd maintain that that uh even<br>as though tax analysts have their<br>personal preferences they can express in<br>uh in elections like anyone else they do<br>actually know something if they're<br>properly trained and can provide<br>politicians whose job it is to impose<br>ideological preferences by giving them<br>better analysis of options of what might<br>happen if you do this rather than that<br>this brings me to the important point of<br>the comparative advantage of the tax<br>instruments over anything else it's very<br>easy for people and perhaps we heard a<br>bit of it this morning with the<br>references to Industrial policy it's a<br>bit easy to say if you've got a really<br>good idea let's throw the kitchen sink<br>at it we'll have something from tax<br>something from subsidies something from<br>this something from that let's all focus<br>on that and put all the instruments of<br>policy behind it to make it happen well<br>the trouble is if you try to do with<br>that with everything you get chaos and<br>so the tax system is very good at doing<br>some things and it's a very poor way of<br>doing other things in particular because<br>it's totally open-ended and if you're<br>what you're trying to do is to benefit a<br>particular group in society who are<br>underprivileged in some way or<br>struggling with a disadvantage of some<br>kind whether or not you use the tax<br>system does take into account well<br>exactly who did you want to reward and<br>how much did you want to reward them by<br>and that's often very poorly done in the<br>tax system which makes the effects<br>available universally for everybody so<br>the principle of comparative advantage<br>applies and I suggest that a lot of the<br>tax debate we've had in New Zealand uh<br>about income distribution and so on<br>hasn't been carefully enough thought<br>through in terms of what can you do with<br>the tax system and what can you do with<br>things that are better suited to the job<br>my final<br>point this about the management of the<br>tax system and I think that the tools<br>and techniques that have emerged Under<br>The Heading of social investment have a<br>lot to contribute uh in Tax<br>Administration now social investment got<br>called social investment because it<br>arose um inside the Ministry of Social<br>Development concerned with what were the<br>long-term impacts of particular<br>situations people found themselves in<br>down the track but the same mathematical<br>and analytical stat statistical<br>techniques can be applied to a lot of<br>other things in the case of tax those of<br>you who PID GST in the room will be<br>aware that in recent years your refund<br>on GST has been arriving a day or so<br>after you put in your return whereas it<br>used to take a couple of weeks and the<br>reason for that is that Inland revenue<br>is using these kinds of techniques to<br>discriminate between people who it's a<br>waste of time investigating and<br>concentrating their resources on people<br>who deserve to be investigated now<br>artificial intelligence will power up<br>these kinds of techniques in in ways yet<br>to be discovered but I think there is a<br>real possibility there of using Ai and<br>Associated analytical methods to become<br>much more targeted uh in the way in<br>which Inland Revenue can chase the<br>people who are not paying taxes they<br>should pay and leaving the rest of us<br>alone as has pretty much happened with<br>with GST so there's my three points and<br>I'm happy now to sit back and Professor<br>scrim will re will rescue me from any<br>hard questions you ask that I<br>can't thanks very much<br>Sandy Anna um k um look the session<br>today is called Running tax differently<br>as we've already mentioned and for me<br>actually I'm probably along the same<br>Spectrum as Graham actually I I I don't<br>really think we need to run tax that<br>differently here in New Zealand and look<br>why I say that well let's just set the<br>scene and say that the basic premise of<br>why um we need a tax system is for a<br>country to collect enough Revenue so<br>that it can run itself in the way that<br>it wants to do now I appreciate that's a<br>bit of a circularity in that statement<br>in itself the question of how much money<br>do we need um how much money we want to<br>spend will determine how much money we<br>need and um I'm going to confess I am<br>definitely not qualified ified to answer<br>either of those questions um but<br>hopefully the Minister of Finance might<br>have um given her thoughts on that early<br>on today but what I do know is that um<br>New Zealand's tax to GDP um has tended<br>to track a little bit below the average<br>um for the oecd countries over the years<br>but actually over the recent years um<br>it's been sitting pretty close to that<br>um oecd<br>average what does that suggest I guess<br>that for me that would suggest that that<br>we're probably not too out of whack in<br>terms of how much tax we collect um and<br>the other interesting reference point is<br>that our net debt position as a nation<br>it's a prob probably a lot healthier<br>than lots of other um countries as well<br>which again suggests that the balance is<br>probably not too out of<br>work but obviously there's been a bit of<br>media around some of the recent um<br>commentary that's come out from um um<br>the treasury which you know and over the<br>last couple of years now they've been<br>telling us that we as a nation's been<br>spending a little bit more than we are<br>earning um and so we really do need to<br>crack down and um buckle up and need to<br>focus to get back to Surf plus which in<br>really basic terms I think it means<br>either spend less money or make more<br>money um but if we set those last few<br>years aside um being quite unique being<br>co and floods and all sorts of things<br>um and if we assume that the spinning<br>side of the equation is about right I<br>think that leaves the last question of<br>well is our tax system collecting tax as<br>well as it can um and Grahams already<br>mentioned you know the efficiency point<br>you want to have a system that creates<br>less Distortion as possible and if we<br>apply those things um I would say I<br>think the overall structure of the New<br>Zealand tax system seems to be pretty<br>sound um and I guess this is something<br>that's come through in a number of the<br>recent tax reviews that's gone on um<br>with the last one being in<br>2019 uh they all generally they all<br>found that the general structure of the<br>New Zealand tax system is okay um but<br>recognizing it did recommend to um some<br>changes might need to be<br>made overall I think it as um grams<br>already mentioned broad-based low rate<br>uh seems to be still a pretty<br>good sound General premise for us as it<br>generates um the required Revenue<br>without too much fuss um but look as we<br>all know there are some probably key um<br>gaps and challenges that we as we look<br>ahead in terms of continuing to use this<br>broad-based low rate um system jumping<br>right into it I think the first one is<br>the taxation of capital income um it's a<br>key area which brings in the question<br>whether we do in fact New Zeal have a<br>broad based low rate system<br>another key observation is um New<br>Zealand is strongly reliant on uh taxes<br>on individuals um I think for<br>2023 um for the 2023 year the total tax<br>take was about 104.5 billion wor over<br>50% of that tax revenue coming from<br>individuals tax most of it being<br>Pye that indicates a very strong<br>Reliance on um tax on labor the<br>challenge with this is that with our<br>changing demography um demography of New<br>Zealand which is been talked about out<br>there I guess um what it all means is<br>that we're going to have less people<br>working um soort the ones that will be<br>generating that um tax revenue and the<br>the balance will shift that we'll have<br>more people not working versus those<br>that are so the key concern will be as<br>we look ahead into the future are we<br>going to have enough people bringing in<br>the amount of Revenue that we need to<br>continue to run the country as we have<br>minute the other piece is I think if we<br>take that into consideration I think<br>there is still merit in continuing on<br>with our broad-based low rate with those<br>key changes one of the um things we've<br>been thinking about that we've been<br>hearing a lot about is some of these<br>other taxes that's been thrown the mix<br>you know um inheritance taxes wealth<br>taxes or the minimum tax that was thrown<br>around um by the previous um in the<br>previous government term to me um if we<br>are in agreement that our broad-based<br>late General system is still doing its<br>job relatively well it might make sense<br>to think about expanding on the basis<br>that we currently have in a consistent<br>manner to the system that we have the<br>things I just rattle off are quite<br>different to the income taxx system that<br>we have um in particular wealth taxes<br>and inheritance taxes requires things<br>tax to be paid even if you haven't got<br>the cash in hand which brings some you<br>know interesting issues if if we were go<br>down that route<br>um but overall I think if we took a step<br>back I don't think we need to do too<br>much difference uh needed to tax two<br>differently um overall as a as as a<br>system itself but one of the things I<br>did do think it might be worthwhile to<br>think about um doing differently is um<br>whether there's Merit in taking the<br>politics out of tax possibly and I know<br>that that's that might be a bit um get a<br>few laughs because it's hard to take the<br>politics out of tax but I think it's a<br>worthwhile idea to think about that and<br>the reason why I suggest this is that<br>over the last few years um I think one<br>of the key things that's been Eed away<br>is the certainty of our tax system um<br>having an uncertain um environment is<br>not great for business um you know<br>taxpayers would like to be able to work<br>out relatively um with some certainty<br>what tax they're going to pay what kind<br>of taxes they have to face um no one<br>really wants a tax surprise um and so<br>any changes should really well be well<br>signal um and then the other piece the<br>other more potentially damaging thing is<br>not so much a tax surprise itself it's<br>the constant changing landscape and<br>whether um including whether something<br>that's proposed will actually eventuate<br>or if something that's been in place<br>gets immediately repealed a couple of<br>years later all of those things are not<br>um you know provides some challenges to<br>um New Zealand as an economy I think and<br>we've got plenty of recent examples of<br>those being um you know the GST on<br>platform is one that's is a really live<br>example where we're seeing businesses<br>really grappling with trying to um<br>Implement these rules by 1 April this<br>year when all along you know throughout<br>the election period it was will they<br>won't they been told that they it will<br>get repealed but now all of a sudden<br>they're back in so you know that's not<br>great that's a really small example but<br>you know puts challenges for businesses<br>as they're trying to navigate um and you<br>know with a three-year election cycle<br>it's a relatively short period of time<br>and if we keep having things chopping<br>and<br>changing I do wonder whether there is<br>some Merit in thinking<br>about taking the politics out of tax a<br>little bit um but you know it's<br>something they be melling over it's a<br>thing that's probably a bit hard to<br>actually eventuate but yeah I thought it<br>would be worthwhile just that might be<br>something we pick up in the questions as<br>well let's let's move over to Lisa for<br>your opening um opening comments thank<br>thanks very much Sandy K Anna K Koso um<br>thank you so much everybody for coming<br>along to the the tax um session it's<br>always good to know that people are<br>interested and um willing to sit through<br>an hour of discussion on tax so um I the<br>couple of points that I want to raise<br>actually pick up on um bit and pieces<br>that Graham and Sandy have have both<br>mentioned um first of all I uh grahe did<br>mention that uh Ramsey tax and the idea<br>of having uh the least impact on<br>people's behavior but what I did want to<br>talk about is behavioral tax which are<br>of course designed to impact on people's<br>behavior and you know I actually<br>thinking again picking up on what Sandy<br>said I think this is one thing we've<br>done reasonably well in New Zealand if I<br>look to some of the things we've done um<br>maybe it's not the right time to mention<br>tobacco taxes but some of the other<br>things we've done like kiwi saver for<br>example relatively low cost but in fact<br>we've had a significant behavioral<br>change without getting the the real<br>unintended consequences that you can<br>have from a tax like that and I would<br>point to perhaps to Australia as an<br>example of of you know how it can all<br>sort of go horribly wrong and and just<br>Advantage the wealthy so there are some<br>taxes where we we have done well<br>um uh I would have said up until fairly<br>recently environmental taxes<br>particularly with with vehicles you know<br>we did manage to get 14% of our new<br>vehicle Fleet last year um being<br>electric and of course we are a long way<br>from Norway at over 80% but you know the<br>change was happening and this is where I<br>think the tax system is actually really<br>or can be really quite uh quite<br>effective um however in order to be<br>really effective um we do need to have<br>some certainty people need to have<br>certainty to make informed decisions and<br>this picks up on exactly what Sandy was<br>saying was when we have the politics and<br>these types of taxes that are intended<br>to impact on Behavior<br>are subject to potential changes every 3<br>years or 6 years or 9 years uh then it's<br>very difficult for people to make<br>informed decisions you know if you look<br>at uh somebody who may have bought uh an<br>electric vehicle in the last year<br>thinking you know it would have a<br>particular value on the secondhand<br>Market which it actually probably<br>doesn't uh with the changes that were<br>announced in the last couple of weeks so<br>that's that's one thing that I think is<br>you know is really important for us to<br>think about uh the other one which is<br>really uh changing Tech completely is um<br>compliance or actually specifically<br>non-compliance with tax and I this is an<br>individual view I would like to see in<br>land Revenue taking much stronger action<br>against people who don't pay their tax<br>and that's across a range of um range of<br>activity whether we're talking about<br>obviously the the the tax evasion so the<br>really over um egregious non-compliance<br>or whether it's even just people who are<br>you know um making poor business<br>decisions and um still finding<br>themselves not in a position to to pay<br>their tax I was looking at um Inland<br>revenue's most recent annual report<br>yesterday and they give a figure of<br>213 customers who were granted tax<br>writeoffs last year<br>213,000 now I'm not saying necessarily<br>that any of that is particularly good or<br>particularly bad but it is inequitable<br>because the 50% of people that Sandy has<br>just referred to who earn wages and<br>salaries don't have the opportunity to<br>go to Inland revenue and ask for some of<br>their tax to be written off and that<br>includes a large proportion of some of<br>the lowest income earners that we have<br>in the country so there are some real<br>Equity issues there um another figure<br>from the annual report 400,000<br>businesses qualified for relief from<br>penalties and<br>if they paid their tax so the penalties<br>and interest are there to encourage<br>people to pay their tax the amount<br>that's due and on time but it's pretty<br>well established that actually you can<br>negotiate and at which point that<br>whole scheme which is intended to act as<br>an incentive to comply becomes sort of<br>somewhat meaningless um I've written on<br>a number of things that I think in L<br>Revenue should be doing that uh they<br>could um possibly think about to try to<br>um well actually not even necessarily to<br>encourage Behavior some of it is<br>encouraging Behavior but some of it is<br>also just creating a bit more visibility<br>around people who are non-compliant to a<br>large extent or repetitive non-compliant<br>where they will manage a business poorly<br>it will go into liquidation with a<br>reasonably significant tax debt and then<br>they will do the same thing again<br>because the problem with that is it<br>impacts on well employees it impacts on<br>the customers who don't get the products<br>they pay for uh impacts on the creditors<br>who never get their bills paid so there<br>is a lot of knock on impacts there um<br>when when Inland Revenue has information<br>which isn't shared so um I have<br>suggested that things like credit<br>reporting so reporting tax debts to<br>Credit Agencies um potentially thinking<br>about publishing tax data details uh<br>when they obviously not every taxt data<br>but you know if they're over a certain<br>amount over 50,000 or over 100,000 or<br>over 6 months old or whatever it is you<br>know a lot of countries do this they<br>publish this information so people<br>dealing with those organizations can<br>make informed decisions um there are<br>other things I've written about as well<br>director penalty notices making<br>directors personally liable for taxes<br>under certain circumstances um but there<br>I I would like to see in land Revenue<br>doing more to collect the tax that's<br>actually due and then we probably<br>wouldn't have to have these<br>conversations about what extra taxes we<br>need because we'd be<br>collecting what we should be thank you<br>thank you very much to our our panelists<br>for those opening remarks that took us<br>on a little bit of a a history tour and<br>and taught us that some of those things<br>are still highly um relevant I think<br>there were some common themes that we<br>heard through there weren't there the<br>importance of not having distortionary<br>effects of Taxation unless that's what<br>we're trying to achieve with our<br>taxation um and also I think that that<br>theme of having some Sur whether it's<br>through managing the political system uh<br>or um just some certainty in in terms of<br>what we're going to expect um is is<br>important including for the<br>practitioners that have to manage these<br>sorts of things so we had some great<br>sort of themes but also some differences<br>we didn't get a strong sense of of the<br>whole taxation system needs to be run<br>completely differently in fact a number<br>our panelists I think all kind of said<br>it was you know these are these are more<br>changes at the margin I guess would be<br>my my hearing of that but um<br>let's let's delve into some of these<br>things in a little bit more detail one<br>of the questions that um that I've got<br>is on<br>um capital gains<br>taxes and this question is that capital<br>gains taxes may be very good in theory<br>but often not good in<br>practice could our panelists and I I'm<br>going to direct it to whichever of you<br>would care to take the question first<br>Could you um provide any examples of a<br>country that has a capital gains tax<br>that has performed<br>well and could you give us any broader<br>insights into your views on capital<br>gains tax and the relevance or<br>irrelevance in dealing with issues that<br>New Zealand uh needs to deal within<br>tax I should say that when I was<br>Secretary of Treasury I recommended a<br>capital gains tax to the government at<br>the time in the early 90s but warned<br>them that the tax they would end up<br>implementing once they'd thought through<br>the politics of it all wouldn't be the<br>one I was<br>recommending and so on balance don't do<br>it unless you're willing to do it in a<br>way that actually raises a lot of money<br>and is actually levied on a on a a base<br>that is reliable you've got good<br>information about it you can um validate<br>that information and and so on and<br>what's happened repeatedly since then is<br>I've had tax spokes people from three<br>different political parties asked me for<br>my advice on capital gains and I've<br>always said the same thing the one<br>you'll get isn't the one you've got in<br>mind and you can end up with not raising<br>much money and uh and creating quite a<br>lot of unintended side effects in the<br>way you have to implement it and that's<br>sort of about where that sits I've had<br>no reason to change my mind about that<br>since I I mean there's all sorts of<br>political arguments but you know I'm not<br>particularly interested in in those but<br>I think as a just in terms of the<br>technical business of Designing it and<br>implementing it it's very hard to get<br>that right um I don't really know of a<br>country that I'd say is a brilliant<br>example to us but then I I don't study<br>this much<br>anymore yeah I was um I guess my<br>question the question that I had in<br>terms of that question is what do you<br>mean by good I suppose is it is good<br>meaning that raises a whole heap of um<br>Revenue um if that's the case then agree<br>with what grams has said it comes out of<br>the design of the system that you can<br>actually I guess sell to the public one<br>way or another the<br>way the way I often think about it is um<br>you know New Zealand has a very enviable<br>GST system right it's one that's applies<br>to pretty much everything and it's at a<br>consistent rate but I wonder whether<br>it's based on the<br>political climate at the time whereby we<br>had a we had a political um system<br>whereby I think was must have been first<br>P<br>post and that the government could just<br>get something like that through whereas<br>nowadays with<br>MMP you know you end up having a lot<br>more discussions and trying to get<br>things across the line so in some ways I<br>don't know whether it's um there is<br>something in thinking about how did New<br>Zealand get such a great GST system in<br>place that's the Envy of everywhere else<br>and then taking some of that experience<br>and thinking about how we might<br>Implement a new a new tax um that's<br>expanding on the well picking up on some<br>of the bases that we're currently not<br>taxing so if that is to be um taxation<br>of capital income then have to think<br>about well<br>maybe we should be a bit more bold and<br>brave and think about how do we get that<br>country maybe where we'll move to now<br>and in fact Lisa this is a question you<br>can tie in capital gains into this one<br>as well if you like Progressive versus<br>regressive<br>taxation um how can the tax system be<br>structured to ensure fairness and Equity<br>particularly the balance between<br>Progressive and regressive taxation of<br>course Equity was an issue that you<br>addressed in your in your opening<br>address I wonder if you'd like to<br>respond to that question please with or<br>without capital gains tax absolutely I<br>might just take advantage and say a<br>couple of things on capital gains as<br>well um I think it's a fair question<br>about whether there is an example of one<br>where where it's done well um they<br>generally don't actually collect a lot<br>of Revenue um so I I if you look at the<br>amount even in Australia if you look at<br>the amount that they theoretically can<br>colle can collect it's very high however<br>by the time you then take off all the<br>exceptions so the 50% discount for<br>assets that are held for longer than a<br>year and all the losses that are carried<br>forward some of them going back to the<br>global financial crisis they actually do<br>end up collecting relatively little so<br>you know whether it's worth it for the<br>the compliance costs that's alongside it<br>I'm not sure um I'll just quickly squeak<br>in my own personal preference if you're<br>going to have a wealth tax is some sort<br>of land tax just because it's a lot um<br>easier to identify land and owners and<br>you can carve out what you want to carve<br>out like productive land or whatever it<br>is um Progressive versus regressive I<br>think you most tax systems have<br>combinations of both of these and<br>that's that to me is is fair um for<br>people who aren't familiar with those<br>tax uh terms um Progressive would be our<br>income tax system where you pay more as<br>you earn more so ability to pay is taken<br>into account so if you're earning more<br>you can at least in theory afford to pay<br>a higher level of tax regressive taxes<br>are taxes um well in fact that the<br>economists would probably not agree with<br>me using the word regressive with a a<br>GST but um I'm not an economist so I'm<br>going to do that and I would say that a<br>GST is regressive because it doesn't<br>take into account ability to pay so uh<br>people you know the example I use with<br>my students is everybody um we will go<br>into the supermarket and buy the same<br>loaf of bread we all pay the same amount<br>of tax it doesn't matter if we earn $10<br>that week or 10,000 we're all paying the<br>same amount so the burden relatively is<br>is is high on lower income earners uh I<br>think having a balance of those is<br>really important because they do have<br>different incentives and impact on<br>behavioral changes and different ways<br>and again um uh to go back to what Sandy<br>said I think actually we've probably got<br>Zealand thanks um I've got a question<br>here Max couldn't be here so in his<br>absence would the panelists like to<br>channel their inax and recommend the<br>single tax change they would Implement<br>from a socially Progressive<br>perspective now maybe it's an unfair one<br>to start with you grahe I don't know<br>would you like to start or should we<br>pass it on to<br>um oh I would answer if I had an answer<br>at the top of my tongue but right now I<br>don't let's pass it to Sandy do you want<br>to make a start and we can come back to<br>gra if you get one on your tongue I<br>would actually flip that around a little<br>bit and turn it back to the transfer<br>system so how can we fun Channel<br>whatever um Revenue well just my really<br>simplistic term is for those that need<br>it why don't we work on the welfare<br>system or the transfer system to try and<br>give them what um they<br>need as opposed to thinking<br>about I guess<br>yeah that's a tough question because you<br>know that would tend to we'll call Max<br>back next year and and let him address<br>it maybe what we'll do then is we'll<br>move on to a slightly different area<br>investment tax um and I think Graham<br>this might be something that that you<br>would be willing to to comment on do we<br>need a tax policy or tax policies that<br>specifically incentivize investment what<br>tax policies could be imp implemented to<br>incentivize domestic and foreign<br>investment and key sectors that would<br>Foster growth and job creation in New<br>Zealand go back to the point I made<br>about comparative advantage is it should<br>you use the tax system to try to do that<br>at all if the primary purpose of the tax<br>system is to raise tax and you don't<br>want unintended behavioral side effects<br>unless they're deliberate in the way<br>that has just been raised there are some<br>places where that's what you want but if<br>you're thinking about what is there in<br>the public policy framework in New<br>Zealand that inhibits foreign investment<br>I wouldn't start with the tax tax system<br>I'd start with overseas investment<br>regulations and various other<br>regulations which are creating<br>artificial sources of of profit and gain<br>in places that are protected from<br>regulation uh real estate investment<br>being the obvious one we don't have a<br>problem in the price of houses we got a<br>problem in the price of land so it's<br>scarely surprising that if you're you're<br>inducing investors to come into New<br>Zealand and come by hotels and you<br>Resorts and all the rest of it because<br>of the artificial scarcity of the of the<br>underlying Factor so i' i' wouldn't have<br>tax at the top of my list of things to<br>do to encourage inward investment but<br>you'd need to be pretty careful to make<br>sure that your company tax rate was<br>internationally<br>competitive um I mean you can see the<br>way Island's got away with what it's<br>done inside the EU because it turned<br>itself into a a Gateway into the rest of<br>Europe by having these very low taxes<br>and attracting all that these high-tech<br>companies and so on which isn't<br>available to New Zealand because we're<br>not a small corner of Europe so I don't<br>think we should consider the tax<br>instrument as being crucial to soling<br>solving our issues about uh about<br>getting foreign investment other than<br>making sure that our company tax rates<br>aren't High we've still got I think the<br>advantage although I know when it comes<br>to International taxes this gets tricky<br>but basically the idea of imputation so<br>you only tax business income once uh in<br>our system instead of twice as happened<br>in the classical system um is a is a<br>good thing and should be retained all I<br>do accept that it's very difficult in<br>negotiations um I look I think agree<br>that I think important point is to make<br>sure we do remain competitive with our<br>um other countries and Company tax rate<br>is one that um you know it's important<br>so as long and it's kind of close<br>closely competitive to our close allies<br>so you know like Australia Australia<br>significantly lower we wouldn't want to<br>be um too far away from them um or uh<br>the other pieces I think I've make this<br>in my opening comment it's around<br>certainty I think having certain tax<br>environment is critical to ensuring that<br>foreign investors are happy to come in<br>so that they have they can have a really<br>clear idea of what the tax profile will<br>look like in the next 20 30 years or<br>whatever it is in particular if we're<br>looking to you know um looking at<br>investment and INF in the infrastructure<br>area say for example which is something<br>that New Zealand probably do need a bit<br>of um at the moment so for me it's it's<br>not so much doing additional things to<br>be attractive as making sure that we<br>don't have a tax system that actually um<br>sort of put puts on handbrakes to stop<br>people from coming in bit of agreement<br>there let's let's move to a slightly<br>different um area that still still ties<br>in with this International<br>competitiveness uh digital taxation<br>sorry digital economy taxation um and of<br>course grae you mentioned about Ai and<br>so on in the context of maybe using that<br>to help the the tax system but let's<br>think about the actual taxes on some of<br>these new technologies including the<br>digital economy that's rapidly evolved<br>as that economy continues to grow what<br>measures do you think are the<br>appropriate measures that New Zealand um<br>should appropriately take um including<br>taking into consideration the challenges<br>of uh implementing laws across<br>International boundaries so Sandy let's<br>start with you on on this one please<br>yeah um so look I I<br>think the oecd has been doing heaps of<br>work in this area over the last oh I<br>feel like it's almost been a decade<br>hasn't it and in ter terms of the<br>digital economy um they've spent a lot<br>of time talking about working on a<br>globally agreed<br>solution um and and look I think that's<br>still probably the way to go is make<br>sure you know there is international<br>consensus and everyone go at it at the<br>same time as opposed to um putting in<br>unilateral Digital Services tax and<br>things like that um and the reason why<br>you<br>know sort of take a bit more of a pause<br>on a digital Services taxes on<br>unilateral I guess measures um by<br>countries like New Zealand is that you<br>know the the bigger economies what sort<br>of retaliation they might have and the<br>likely potential impact it has on our um<br>New Zealand businesses that are looking<br>to expand offshore and things like that<br>um so I think it's definitely an area<br>that we do need to rethink our tax rules<br>generally because those were made based<br>on um you know much more bricks and<br>water type economy and so things do need<br>to change but and I but I do think that<br>the changing making sure it's we're um<br>doing it Co in a cohesive manner along<br>with the rest of the world's probably<br>the best way to go as opposed to going<br>ahead unilaterally and charging on and<br>you know implementing a new tax and my<br>take on that is um we're hopelessly<br>unprepared for this um the digital<br>autonomous organization or Dows as they<br>get called by their initial<br>seem to me to be The Little Engine That<br>Could spark a wave of innovation in our<br>economy right across it everywhere and<br>the thing to keep in mind about these<br>digital autonomous organizations is they<br>are exactly what the name says they<br>operate without human<br>intervention the other thing about them<br>is that they blur the distinction<br>between an owner a manager and a<br>customer<br>they have internal voting procedures and<br>so on so sometimes you're an investor<br>and sometimes you're on the board of<br>directors carrying directors<br>responsibilities and I think our tax<br>system and our and our system for<br>regulating financial institutions is<br>completely blind to what's going to<br>happen you'll never stop the income<br>that's generated and these things from<br>showing up anywhere around the world<br>that it chooses to go<br>and you'll have terrible trouble<br>applying a classical system of<br>Regulation and tax to get out these<br>things and I'm really disappointed that<br>there so Little's been done I know the<br>reserve bank's doing a bit as far as I<br>know the financial services people<br>aren't doing much and I know The<br>Regulators have barely even thought<br>about it in other aspects but I think<br>it's something we need to get on top of<br>otherwise you're going to find that the<br>huge holes been blind and the tax system<br>and regulations are being invaded with<br>these things so certainly something you<br>would think about doing a bit<br>differently from currently um question<br>in Lisa for for for you perhaps uh what<br>changes do you see if any that need to<br>occur um within charities in terms of<br>exempt um yeah always always a popular<br>one isn't it um you know there there are<br>certainly questions to be asked around<br>whether big businesses are<br>legitimate Charities even if you can<br>draw a reasonably direct line to well<br>per a dotted line to to the um to the<br>benefit or where th where those funds<br>are supposed to go um I I think it is a<br>legitimate question to be asked I'd like<br>to see us looking at that um and oh<br>there was something that popped into my<br>mind there and it's just gone straight<br>out<br>um no Sandy do you want to and I'll see<br>see if it comes back yeah I think I mean<br>it's definitely one that's uh bubbled<br>around quite a bit the the the question<br>around whether<br>um the exemption should apply to a<br>business operation of a charitable<br>organization I mean there's for and<br>against kind of um comments you might<br>make I mean the first one that often<br>comes up is with um it's it's well<br>whether there's competitive Advantage<br>for say a um<br>charitable uh a business of a charity um<br>against another just a private privately<br>owned um business because then they have<br>the competitive advantage of not having<br>to pay tax um and so I I mean I'd<br>imagine this would be something that's<br>continue going to be having it um be be<br>considered by um officials I guess<br>and often with these things there's<br>um there's always trade-offs right and<br>so it'll be interesting to see where<br>officials get to I suppose and let me<br>just jump back in I've remembered what I<br>was thinking um it's also when you see<br>Charities that are accumulating<br>significant assets and those assets are<br>not actually being spent in the way that<br>they should be being spent so invested<br>in their their particular public good um<br>which is why they're a charity in the<br>first place so I think there is again a<br>legitimate question to be asked where if<br>you are accumulating assets above<br>certain thresholds um whether the<br>charitable um tax benefits should still<br>remain yeah and it goes back to what<br>Sandy said about being<br>competitive thanks and we've we've only<br>got two minutes left so I'm going to ask<br>for some brief and this will be the<br>final um the final question so you can<br>rackon your final thought on what we<br>want to do differently as well but the<br>question I'd like to wrap this around is<br>the potential importance of small<br>businesses in New Zealand to driving<br>Innovation and and employment we are a<br>nation of um of largely small businesses<br>are there any things with particularly<br>with respect to small businesses uh that<br>you would like to be S seen done<br>differently in terms of tax and if we<br>can have a 30 second answer from each of<br>you that gives a wrap up that will be<br>fantastic grahe just follow the example<br>that's happened with GST just leave them<br>alone until you've got reason to think<br>they're cheating on their taxes and stop<br>loading them down with useless<br>compliance and so on that goes on at the<br>moment and assume that they're that<br>they're honest until your AI picks up a<br>patent that says actually the might not<br>be well done less than 30 seconds this<br>will be um quite strange coming from a<br>Tax Advisor but I re and less complexity<br>would be the way to go um I guess<br>similar to Graham's point is that um you<br>know businesses you wish should let let<br>the businesses run their business as<br>opposed to bog down with um figuring out<br>what they should be doing with their<br>tax and I would say compliance you know<br>I I talk to small businesses and one of<br>the things they say is that get it's<br>very hard to compete when they're are<br>compliant business but actually their<br>competitors are not compliant and<br>they're getting Advantage because you<br>know they're not compliant with the GST<br>or the PA or or whatever it is so again<br>I'm sort of the opposite of what grma<br>said which is actually I think more<br>focused on compliance by way of um small<br>business honesty and perhaps we might<br>get some of that with the AI that grahe<br>also mentioned so we had some different<br>views there we had some similar themes<br>come through there but we certainly had<br>some um uh some very rich insights into<br>lots of Taxation issues thank you very<br>much for our audience for making that<br>big step out of the other room and<br>coming and joining us in here uh in 4<br>seconds we're going to invite you to go<br>back into that room over there and<br>rejoin the main session but first of all<br>please I'd like to extend our um sincere<br>thanks to our panelists for their uh<br>contributions<br>thank you very much and thanks for a<br>such</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
