font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>uh so last panel of the day I think we<br>agreed Brooke you're going to start so<br>yours just want acknowledge<br>theano and thanks so much wo um<br>university for hosting this um I just<br>want to start by uh making giving a bit<br>of a background on sheres and then we'll<br>get into um the fintech future side of<br>things so um at cheeses we started in<br>2017 and our purpose is to create<br>financial empowerment for everyone and<br>we do that by giving someone with $5 and<br>five million the same money<br>opportunities um we operate across Al<br>and Australia we have just under three<br>billion um and funds under management<br>and around um 630,000 uh investors in<br>our platform um what you may not know is<br>there there's two arms to shy so we've<br>got the W where provide access to<br>investing and kiwi saer and save but<br>also Al got this other arm which is as<br>we've started to grow over the years<br>we've learned a lot about how companies<br>really want to be connecting with retail<br>investors and Retail investors want to<br>have a way closer connection with<br>companies too so we've created this<br>aspect of sheries called cheses open<br>which allows listed companies in New<br>Zealand and Australia to connect a bit<br>more closer with their retail investors<br>through communicating to them um<br>offering them Equity Capital raises and<br>also what we do with these listed<br>companies is support them with their<br>staff share schemes and we've got a<br>number of those across the Motu so<br>that's just a bit of a holistic view of<br>shes because some of you may know us as<br>investing but last year we really<br>branched out quite a<br>lot so there's sessions about fintech<br>Futures and I thought in order to talk<br>about the future we should reflect on<br>the past as uh Albert Einstein quoted if<br>you want to know the future look at the<br>past so let's step back to<br>1958 when one of the biggest Global<br>Financial Innovations was starting to<br>take shape starting is a bank of Italy<br>to bank uh to bank the non the unbanked<br>Italians in the California Community<br>which then morphed into a bigger Bank of<br>America and then the formation of Bank<br>of America arts and Innovation Grew From<br>the ability to take<br>IUS um at the local store so yes I'm<br>talking about this Innovation started<br>from you know going to the petrol store<br>and be like I'll pay you later mate and<br>you know put it on the put on the T some<br>of you may have experienced that I'm not<br>sure um to you could do that in local<br>stores so not just at the that that<br>registry happening just at that petrol<br>station you could have it at the um at<br>restaurants you go to and and and start<br>to kind of create that credit uh uh and<br>that kind of digital payment technology<br>now what company do you think uh that<br>into that it's a hint it's now the 11th<br>largest market Capital uh it's got the<br>payments hey good someone got it visa so<br>this is Visa officially launching 47<br>years ago um it's got a net interest um<br>net income margin of 50% so 300 billion<br>in Revenue which is massive um to give<br>it context Google is a you know got a<br>net um income margin around 21% everyone<br>has probably interacted or touched visa<br>and that all started in and I'll I'll<br>come back to a little bit about why I<br>mentioned that the next Innovation I<br>want to talk about which I think we all<br>will know and love maybe is fpos and I<br>assume you're all kind of familiar with<br>that here in fpos New Zealand so we<br>tried it here first in the mid 80s and<br>rapidly spread in 1990s it became the<br>dominant form of payment um by 1997 so<br>around your erand as prime minister um<br>while this text started in the states we<br>lead the world in globally rolling it<br>out and now where are we at we have<br>paywave um and we're definitely falling<br>behind the old sticky tape no paywave<br>sign um the lack of ability to pay wave<br>yourself on public transport like you<br>Canon and Sydney gosh that's so easy um<br>and horrifically the expense of it some<br>charging up to 3% to your transactions<br>just for a tap um I I'm seeing a legout<br>effect and it's impacting all finex here<br>in Al the great thing is um is that it<br>doesn't have to be that case I I want to<br>give you two kind of on the ground shes<br>examples of the fintech lag we've<br>experienced in New Zealand compared to<br>operating in Australia one is around<br>open banking the ability to round up<br>your investment so say I buy o gra I'm a<br>I'm a tea lover say you go and buy a cup<br>of tea and that's $4.70 it's more like<br>$6 now but anyway and that 30 cents can<br>get rolled up into investing we offer<br>that in Australia but we can't offer<br>that here we also in Australia offer<br>instant deposits and withdrawals because<br>if they've got a um b in a recent um<br>payment system NPP um we do this all in<br>Australia right now and we um can't hear<br>in New Zealand yet and then AI we're<br>working on AI Innovation right now that<br>we know that we can roll out in<br>Australia uh under our current licensing<br>regime there but it's a little bit more<br>unclear at the stage how we do that here<br>which we'll we'll find a way for sure so<br>the opportunity that I see is that part<br>of that Visa story that I didn't tell<br>you is that it it started all by<br>Maverick um who took who took that<br>global payment a digital payment system<br>and brought that to life de Hawk he<br>didn't even work at Bank of America<br>actually he worked as a program director<br>of Bank of America at another bank who<br>was using that service he noticed that<br>this technology needed to be non-bank<br>Centric and needed to be Global in order<br>to do this he had to work closely with<br>governments and Regulators to remove<br>anti-competitive laws that would block<br>such innovation and I'm sure you to<br>remove a bunch of other laws too so that<br>connection with government and<br>Regulators in order to bring Innovations<br>to life is crucial and has been<br>throughout history this brings me to the<br>opportunity we have in Al TI we're small<br>as Matt joked um last night you may have<br>likely uh met go to school with or<br>worked with one of Jim Boulders n<br>tamariki the opportunity we have um in<br>fintech is that from what I see and here<br>in my discussions with the top leaders<br>of our regulator<br>uh such as FMA and also those that don't<br>regulate us um maybe yet rbn Z is that<br>they want to see Financial Innovation<br>here in ALA actually they recognize we<br>need it there are too many underserved<br>unserved or if people are served not in<br>a way that enables access to World<br>leading<br>Innovation if we create a joint strategy<br>at the highest level that we will work<br>with fintech and Innovation for a<br>greater benefit of Al as long as we're<br>keeping people's money safe safe and we<br>know where and what their money is in<br>and at all times we know who we're<br>dealing with at the simplest that's<br>fintech<br>regulation the ability to pick up the<br>phone is a massive strategic Advantage<br>for our country on a global stage we<br>have three good examples of this being<br>brought to life driving Innovation here<br>in aloa and<br>Australia the first great example of<br>this was when we decided and we worked<br>really hard to fractionalize the New<br>Zealand and the Australian stock<br>exchange we are inid EXP participant and<br>nzx is one of our Regulators too and<br>when we were becoming a participant and<br>as you might have recalled our vision is<br>to give someone with5 million5 a same<br>many opportunities we wanted to create a<br>way where you didn't have to buy a full<br>share to be able to put you know to be<br>able to participate and become an<br>investor so we to work really closely<br>with the nzx and keep coming back to our<br>core premise or the core litmus test in<br>a way which is does this give someone<br>with $5 a same<br>opportunity and from that we're were<br>able to find a way where we could<br>fractionalize the New Zealand Stock<br>Exchange doing that here and that hard<br>Mah we did together we then got to be<br>able to do that and we're the first ones<br>to do that uh in Australia too through<br>the conversations that we've had with<br>essc and um going under the licensed<br>regime<br>there the second example of where this<br>has really worked well is our unique<br>kiwi saer offering so even though it<br>took a very long time and a lot longer<br>than we would have hoped um it was a<br>really great example of working closely<br>with the FMA eventually we had someone<br>assigned to us at the FMA who was high<br>enough in terms of understanding of the<br>industry and how we operate but also<br>knew how FMA ticked<br>too he we would be able to sense check<br>things with them and and be able to you<br>know get a bit of an Insight before we<br>had to go down the legal R rigar roll<br>essentially go do you think you know<br>where does this kind of sit you pick up<br>the phone and have a bit of a discussion<br>before you started to decide if you're<br>going to really invest in a certain<br>aspect of that<br>technology through this relationship<br>we're able to co-create the guard rails<br>which is a um one of the systems we have<br>within our kiwi saer um scheme so that<br>people are always wild Diversified so<br>the max investment you can put in one<br>individual stock is 5% and we worked<br>really closely to make sure that because<br>we really wanted to make sure that<br>people had more control over their<br>investing uh and their and the and where<br>the Kiwi sa is going which is where the<br>majority of New zealanders Wealth sits<br>but also making sure that they they were<br>within some gu guard rails to ensure<br>that they were setting themselves up for<br>the long term the Third third and<br>probably quite unique example we had too<br>was actually when we first started<br>sheries so back in 200 and 18 we were in<br>a fintech accelerator down in Wellington<br>and as part of this accelerator and one<br>of a really amazing opportunity that uh<br>we had was that there were two directors<br>from the FMA that were part of that so<br>they would come and meet us and come<br>meet the other people in this<br>accelerator and that was really great<br>because we I had a bit of a background<br>understanding that am legislation and so<br>did others in our team but it was really<br>great to make sure again that we could<br>sense check things and ensure that we<br>were building those<br>relationships so I guess what I'm saying<br>is to all the policy policy makers in<br>the room and watching online professors<br>um government officials please reach out<br>to us we're trying to spend way more<br>time with you and um please connect with<br>us too we're always moving at speed at<br>delivering to our purpose and often we<br>don't know the world that you operate in<br>as well um but do reach out because<br>you'll be greeted with a lot of keenness<br>what entrepreneurs are best at is<br>problem solving and what you're best at<br>is understanding how to drive change in<br>complex systems together we can create<br>future for people we don't even think is<br>possible today there are barriers<br>fintech entrepreneurs like ourselves<br>will always find a way even if that<br>means going to another country where the<br>regulator regulatory regime is easier to<br>innovate for greater good so let's<br>ensure New Zealand becomes the best<br>place where Innovation happens first and<br>we have the best chance of creating<br>everyone thanks bro Koto uh thanks to<br>the wo University uh for having us along<br>today to chat um my name is Shane Marsh<br>I'm the co-founder of money app do<br>really enjoyed the monetary policy<br>discussion uh yesterday afternoon and it<br>had me reflecting on some of Steven<br>Joyce's comments around the current<br>state of uh financials for a lot of<br>people in New Zealand he used the words<br>uh hurting and left high and dry and I<br>think that's a reflective of what a lot<br>of people are feeling at the moment with<br>the cost of living crisis in New Zealand<br>and the uh increased interest rates that<br>people are having to get their finances<br>around and I can't contrast that to the<br>banking industry which in the last year<br>has reported uh record profit<br>for our dominant Banks uh through<br>increasing margins and increasing<br>volumes and The Reserve Bank of New<br>Zealand put out a report uh middle of<br>last year which identified that in the<br>banking industry in New Zealand the<br>banks are the most profitable from a<br>return on Equity perspective in the<br>world so in the world New Zealand has<br>the most profitable<br>Banks which as I suspect pleases the IBN<br>Z very much because as we talked about<br>yesterday there's two key measures<br>getting inflation under control and<br>financial<br>stability but to what extent is should<br>Financial stability dominate to the<br>point where everyday new zealanders are<br>getting hit financially in the pocket<br>more than they should and the two<br>billion profit from one of the banks uh<br>instead of being in the the pockets of<br>new zealanders is in the pockets of<br>Australian know<br>organizations<br>and is there an issue with competition<br>in the banking<br>industry the Commerce Commission is<br>currently undertaking a investigation<br>into competition in the personal banking<br>industry and that is outcome was be<br>reported in August of next<br>year but clearly there is an issue with<br>competition in the New Zealand banking<br>industry and New Zealand has some of the<br>highest barriers to entry in the banking<br>industry in the western<br>world and I'll give you some<br>examples in the UK if you want to start<br>a bank you have to place a million<br>pounds with the central bank and the<br>regulator in Singapore that's 15 million<br>pound $15 million sorry doll in<br>Australia that's $15<br>million and in New Zealand that's $30<br>million so with the deposit takers act<br>being reviewed I I met with the Reserve<br>Bank and thought discuss with them<br>perhaps what would be the right number<br>for New Zealand maybe it's 8 million<br>maybe it's 10<br>million um but the the thinking at the<br>time and and car may be up to update in<br>terms of where they got to was to<br>increase it to 40<br>million so that was a end of the<br>conversation at that point I went on to<br>other things but on a practical level if<br>you look at the industry when was the<br>last time I start up into the banking<br>Market while it was kiwi Bank more 24<br>years ago<br>and before that who knows yes there's<br>been foreign Banks come in and put their<br>money in New Zealand and few existing<br>large organizations become Banks but in<br>terms of new competitors in the market<br>that hasn't<br>existed post the GFC governments around<br>the world responded to what they saw as<br>excess Bank profit and bad Bank Behavior<br>by introducing new regulations aimed at<br>increasing competition increased<br>competition be good for consumers and<br>will keep the banks accountable and they<br>introduced something called open banking<br>open banking is a set of rules that<br>effectively enable new competitors in<br>the market enable new technology<br>companies to access services that they<br>wouldn't be able to do to offer<br>Innovative new solutions that will<br>benefit<br>consumers and it's been a phenomenon it<br>took off from the UK and Europe it's<br>gone around the world everyone's picking<br>up on open banking<br>because there's this new cohort of<br>technology that with the opportunity to<br>innovate and compete is offering new<br>solutions for a new digital world that's<br>quite different than traditional banking<br>of the<br>past and the good news is that open bank<br>is coming to New Zealand it's been<br>discussed for a long time but we've see<br>some actual movements forward in open<br>banking this year what that will mean is<br>that new organiz ations fex will be able<br>to access Services via apis and deliver<br>new solutions for<br>consumers it won't include reduction of<br>barriers in terms of how much Capital<br>you need to park with the Reserve<br>Bank I was living in Singapore um around<br>preco and that was a fascinating time in<br>a market that is um so forward looking<br>from a fintech perspective driven by the<br>government there actively involved in<br>driving change and supporting new<br>Solutions in the market new innovative<br>solutions that create value for<br>consumers and a public adopting those<br>them it's yet to be seen within New<br>Zealand will benefit from the open<br>banking opportunity but I really hope it<br>does because I think as a organ as a<br>country we deserve it I returned to New<br>Zealand and founded do do is a money app<br>that Ena you to manage your money spend<br>and<br>save at do we strongly believe that New<br>Zealand deserves better better choice<br>better Innovation and better value than<br>what's offered<br>today we design and build for the<br>digital generation who want to improve<br>their financial well-being and deserve<br>to have the world's best tools to do so<br>thank<br>you<br>and Karen no doubt you got some thoughts<br>on<br>that yeah I think we'll end up spinning<br>a bit of time on some of that today for<br>sure hey um so I just wanted to start oh<br>sorry<br>go um I I just wanted to start by um<br>referring back actually to uh the second<br>part of the um of today's uh topic which<br>refers to the end of cash and just<br>explain a little more around adrianne's<br>statement uh earlier today where he<br>talked about uh New Zealand uh operating<br>in a less cash not cash less<br>Society um and I think in order to do<br>that first thing you need to understand<br>is what actually is cash and cash is a<br>physical form of central bank money and<br>what that actually means is that it is<br>issued by the Reserve Bank of New<br>Zealand and it is essentially Government<br>Act that differs very very much from<br>private money and private money is uh<br>the money that's sitting in your bank<br>account uh sitting in um and it's the<br>funds you hold or are lent by a private<br>institution and therefore it carries the<br>backing of that institution not<br>government um I think it's important to<br>understand that cash still plays many<br>important roles uh here in New Zealand<br>uh the first of those that I would call<br>out is that it is a Val ener uh for uh<br>the monetary system here in New Zealand<br>um the undertaking That central bank<br>money has that enables the exchange of<br>private bank money into liquid and safe<br>cash reassures new zealanders that<br>private money issued uh by Banks and uh<br>holding assets that uh vary in risk and<br>uh forms of liquidity will always have<br>an unambiguous value to others and I say<br>that noting that that is on a going<br>concern basis it's not in the situation<br>where you're no longer a going concerned<br>so the one for one exchange between<br>private money and Central Bank uh<br>money uh supports um the exchange<br>between different forms of private money<br>and you don't have to differentiate in<br>its value when you use it in your<br>everyday<br>activities all that that helps to<br>support trust you know a word that keeps<br>coming up in this forum trust and<br>confidence in the system and importantly<br>it supports monetary sovereignty here in<br>New Zealand which is important for<br>financial stability and price stability<br>two things that have been talked about<br>at length again uh in this<br>forum the next thing I'd call out is<br>that cash provides a physical means of<br>instant and final settlement with the<br>addition of pracy so it creates choice<br>and<br>autonomy um it also leans heavily into<br>two other areas resilience and inclusion<br>and we've talked today uh in the prize<br>session in particular around uh<br>resilience so cat has been proven to be<br>crucial in emergencies and remains<br>crucial in emergencies here in New<br>Zealand when digital and private<br>infrastructure may not be available<br>Cyclone Gabriel is the last example of<br>that um and two so two days after the<br>Cyclone hit in February last year<br>internet cell phones ATMs and fos<br>systems were still largely unavailable<br>in<br>tifi the ATM and Branch networks were<br>only partially restored a week later so<br>what we saw was a surge in the demand<br>for cash because that was the only means<br>of payment<br>uh in that area in that affected area so<br>cash still has a very important role to<br>um play in resilience and we're at a<br>critical point in the cash system in New<br>Zealand where its resilience is failing<br>it's failing because the channels uh<br>that uh have enabled the availability of<br>cash are changing so the closure of<br>Branch networks the reduction in ATMs<br>the normal sources of cash here in New<br>Zealand are<br>diminishing uh and so uh Adrian again<br>referred this morning to some work that<br>we're doing uh where we are uh will be<br>spending time with uh in particular<br>rural communities um to trial different<br>options for to support uh the provision<br>of cash and the circulation of cash in<br>those communities to make them make them<br>more sustainable and improve resilience<br>and something which is still uh<br>critically important the last point I'd<br>make on cash is the role that it plays<br>in terms of financial<br>inclusion so digitally or financially<br>excluded new zealanders depend on cash<br>cash enables them to fully participate<br>in our economy and and that in an<br>economy which is increasingly digital in<br>nature uh the department of internal<br>affairs estimate up to one in five new<br>zealanders are remain digitally excluded<br>today um these new zealanders uh may not<br>be able to afford connections devices or<br>actually have the skills to be able to<br>use these uh tools<br>confidently additionally uh they<br>estimate that Circa 30 uh Circa 60,000<br>new zealanders over the age of 15 still<br>do not have access to a bank account<br>today and so therefore they are again<br>reliant on cash as their only means of<br>payment so um cash today uh remains<br>relevant in meeting both uh what is<br>essential in times of stress for all of<br>us um and the everyday needs for many<br>new zealanders still<br>today um I'll briefly uh just switch to<br>uh digital uh which I know will end up<br>being the topic for the rest of the<br>day so the first thing I want to do is<br>actually acknowledge the importance of<br>technology and the role that finex can<br>play in the New Zealand Financial system<br>uh to enable greater productivity and<br>competition and ideally with the aim of<br>delivering better services for new<br>zealanders and New Zealand<br>businesses it's also important though to<br>recognize that uh Regulatory and uh<br>Brook and uh Shane have talked a lot<br>about regulatory organizations it's<br>important to organize that uh to<br>understand that regulatory organizations<br>carry statutory objectives designed to<br>maintain the certainty of systemically<br>important activities and mitigate or<br>manage any potential loss of confidence<br>in those<br>systems um that support the economy and<br>that includes the financial<br>system the challenge for Regulators is<br>often then to face is to manage the<br>requirement for maintaining that level<br>of resilience in those systems so that<br>you can go about the every and do the<br>everyday things that you need to do uh<br>with confidence and with certainty with<br>the<br>desirability of taking a much more<br>proportionate approach to regulation in<br>order to support greater competition<br>because<br>competition uh will improve uh will<br>improve efficiency and continue to allow<br>this economy to<br>grow um we acknowledge also that new<br>market players um Can Face significant<br>challenges and understanding in meeting<br>the current requirements to support<br>active participation in that system and<br>um we're very open to taking feedback<br>into consideration on a number of the<br>current activities that we are<br>undertaking particularly at The Reserve<br>Bank of New Zealand in areas where a<br>more proportionate approach is likely to<br>be required Shane you've uh referred to<br>one of those with the deposit takers act<br>um<br>and uh and how uh The Reserve Bank May<br>interpret the requirement for uh<br>ensuring safeness and soundness within<br>the financial system while becoming the<br>regulator to uh non-bank deposit takers<br>um and uh that is a piece of work that<br>is underway and it has anchored in its<br>heart proportionality as one of those<br>key uh aspects of it um there will be<br>engagement over the N with markets over<br>the next 12 and participants in markets<br>over the next 12 months as those<br>standards are developed uh and so that<br>is a piece of work that is going on and<br>consultation is important to ensure that<br>uh the right feedback is received and we<br>understand uh what the balance needs to<br>be be between uh managing risk uh uh and<br>at the same time enabling competition to<br>it so understanding that net economic<br>contribution will be important uh to<br>that<br>um we also uh have a current review of<br>the requirements for the direct access<br>for uh esess which is the exchange<br>settlement core settlement system in the<br>financial<br>sector um that enables uh the the free<br>flow of payments and money across uh the<br>financial sector um this is the first<br>time in 30 years that access criteria<br>are being<br>reviewed having now kicked it off I ful<br>understand why it's taken 30 years to do<br>the review again because the system is<br>incredibly important and complex in<br>terms of the roles that it plays and so<br>it's opening up PO can of worms but it<br>is definitely one of those areas um<br>we've also initiated a multi-year<br>program um of work investigating the use<br>and design of a New Zealand Central Bank<br>digital currency so I talked about cash<br>being the manifestation in a physical<br>form of central bank money central bank<br>money is also the balances that bank<br>Banks hold with us in esess which is<br>that core settlement and clearing<br>system um we are now investigating the<br>alternative of a universal Central Bank<br>digital currency which would not replace<br>cash but could work alongside cash that<br>um has the opportunity for us to offer<br>an alternative entry point to the<br>payments system for finex over<br>time um and lastly I'd just talk about<br>the role of the Council of financial<br>regulators I am extremely happy that you<br>had a good experience uh with the FMA on<br>Ki saver um that uh is<br>um that that reflects an initiative that<br>Council of financial regul Regulators<br>have uh kicked off which is around how<br>do we support finex to better understand<br>and navigate their way<br>through um the reg the current<br>regulatory regime and uh<br>to date we've uh received extremely<br>positive feedback so it doesn't matter<br>what entry point they come through with<br>their questions let's bring them into<br>that Forum which has been set up and<br>designated in order for uh finex to be<br>able to work across the whole spectrum<br>because it's a very disaggregated model<br>that we have in terms of<br>Regulation um and lastly um just to a<br>point uh that Shane raised um just in<br>relation to the future of payments ker<br>have also uh launched a piece of where<br>we are working together to increase the<br>focus on the future of payments for New<br>Zealand and how do we as<br>Regulators uh and government agencies uh<br>support um more innovation in that area<br>and that includes a focus on the<br>delivery of the current payments<br>industry promise that they have made to<br>minimize barriers to entry and in<br>particular through the development of<br>no I'll go to this one all right a lot<br>to cover there and I think I'm going to<br>loop back into the regulatory side in a<br>moment but there were a couple of<br>questions on the app that came through<br>around Financial inclusion which came<br>from different ways so we won't spend<br>all of our time on that but I'm going to<br>cut to you Brooke because you talked<br>about that right at the start what are<br>you doing to raise financial literacy<br>through technology platforms and to<br>include more people into the uh into the<br>world of Finance investment uh the<br>monetary system yeah so when we were<br>deciding uh to do something in the space<br>we spent a lot of time doing deep<br>ethnographic interviews with hundreds of<br>people in Al and we learned that there<br>were holistically three things that were<br>stopping people in terms of feeling like<br>they could get ahead and develop wealth<br>and the three were that they felt priced<br>out like like to to be an investor you<br>needed tens of thousands and also our<br>research showed that 99% of people<br>wanted to be an investor but they felt<br>they couldn't so that was one the second<br>was jargon out they felt like you know<br>you had to have a degree in it and know<br>all the jargon that kind of flies at you<br>and I'm sure all of you in the industry<br>you still sometimes like baffled by some<br>of the draggon that hits you um and then<br>the third was felt left out like it just<br>wasn't for them it's something that's<br>just for the um for a few and not for<br>everyone so those were the three key<br>barriers that we we knew that we needed<br>to completely obliterate essentially uh<br>uh so that's why we made sure that you<br>know we've had those conversations where<br>we every investment on shares is<br>literally the minimum invest investment<br>you can make is a scent in every single<br>one on there like we've really worked<br>hard to make sure of that<br>fractionalization so that price out's<br>gone the jargon out we use everyday<br>language we do quite a lot of content<br>and education so much so that actually<br>it's who who knew that that would be we<br>knew it would be a benefit for you know<br>New Zealand and Society and also in<br>Australia because we make sure all of<br>that content's free no matter what if<br>you're a sh's customer or not but what's<br>being a side benefit of that now is<br>we've got this um technology called fin<br>AI which uh responds to customers<br>immediately to the questions and it's<br>getting an incredible success rate like<br>closing 60% of the queries that come<br>through all because we've got this Rich<br>data set of great content that support<br>people in that process so there's<br>another side angle of that um there's<br>heaps more to do here we're really<br>honestly just getting started the the<br>total Financial inclusion part you know<br>completely isn't there and I think<br>there's a lot that Maria English and<br>what she talked about um focuses on end<br>that we're not really working on yet but<br>as as soon as someone has some means to<br>be able to develop wealth we want to be<br>there to support them on that journey<br>and so we have you know people from 0 to<br>97 years old on sh's platform you know<br>newborn babies around like 30 to 30 to<br>50,000 kids you know I'm really excited<br>for this generation of people just like<br>think that that's you know that's of<br>course I'm an investor you know I can<br>develop wealth thank you um again before<br>I get to regulatory you just touched as<br>Adrian did on Central Bank digital<br>currencies I asked him about those last<br>year I think uh can you where's the<br>where's the bank's work at on that and<br>that ties into a question that came<br>through the app in a world of digital<br>payments Shane you'll be interested here<br>too what are the implications for things<br>like privacy so we know it's likely to<br>go to less cash rather than cash less<br>but people are going to obviously have<br>security concerns all of that but if you<br>can start with the cbdcs the Central<br>Bank digital currencies what's what's<br>the bank up to yeah so um as I said a<br>really significant piece of work um<br>multi-year program uh investigating um<br>the design and use of digital currency<br>uh here in New Zealand um we're one of<br>probably a 100 countries uh that are<br>doing this piece of work and so it's<br>it's a great Learning Network as we<br>think through um how this might work uh<br>in a global sense um where we're at is<br>uh we have finished what we call phase<br>one which is initial Discovery uh in<br>terms of thinking about um why why would<br>you do a digital currency here in New<br>Zealand and obviously multiple reasons<br>uh competition being one of them uh<br>competition and inclusion uh being one<br>of them uh in terms of being offering an<br>opportunity in terms of a way to create<br>and support more Innovation here in New<br>Zealand um but also in a world where we<br>are are increasingly seeing as a result<br>of the benefits that technology offers<br>greater<br>fragmentation not just a payment systems<br>but potentially of money types it's very<br>important for us in order to be able to<br>par participate in that world with<br>central bank money because of the role<br>that central bank money plays<br>in anchoring monetary sovereignty which<br>is incredibly important for this economy<br>from both a financial stability and<br>price stability perspective so we we've<br>done a lot of the initial uh thinking<br>around why uh and we uh and which has<br>involved uh quite extensive consultation<br>and engagement we have a um designated<br>Forum that works with us on this which<br>includes Fint Civil Society<br>uh Banks uh and uh legal uh Council um<br>working with us in terms of testing<br>ideas and and uh the the issues that we<br>might need to address in terms of doing<br>that the next phase that which we<br>heading into now is going okay so what<br>would design look like taking into<br>account all of those<br>things thank you I'm going to then cut<br>to you Shane how do you think about the<br>issue of privacy to do with digital<br>currencies yeah I think um from a<br>digital payments and Innovation<br>perspective there's uh fantastic<br>opportunities to improve the the vast<br>amount of payment processes today and<br>payment services to customers so faster<br>better information um better<br>certainty um being able to split bills<br>out and get paid back quickly be ability<br>to request money there's a range of<br>stuff in does delivered a lot of that<br>into New Zealand um but it must also be<br>noted that that all needs to take place<br>within the existing regulatory<br>environment that protects things such as<br>money laundering privacy data security<br>Etc and so th those new Services need to<br>be built out in that context um to make<br>sure that you're not creating gaps or<br>risks um or unforeseen U outcomes and so<br>from a priv privacy<br>perspective absolutely the the privacy<br>of the individuals needs to be<br>maintained and their data um as Things<br>become increasingly digital that means<br>that security needs to be you know takes<br>on a different form um there can be<br>benefits if you're walking around with<br>cash you're more likely to get head over<br>the and money stolen if it's digital you<br>need to make sure that your account<br>can't be accessed um there is a as you<br>would have read in the media a<br>significant increase in scams going<br>through the banks and targeting Bank C<br>customers so there is a need for<br>education and um being very careful<br>about how you know some of the digital<br>platforms are are managed um but again<br>with fintech there's opportunities and<br>you're seeing some of this beginning to<br>come out of Australia for technology to<br>solve that issue as well in terms of<br>certainty of who's paying who who's<br>accessing accounts um and really I don't<br>think they can come soon enough so so<br>technology will will help solve some of<br>those issues but to the point it needs<br>to be within the confines of the<br>existing regulatory regime thank you so<br>shifting gears and this is going to lead<br>us into the discussion about regulation<br>um I mentioned yesterday at the W<br>management School we're launching New<br>Zealand's first fintech degree so the<br>first 4050 students will be starting the<br>week after next to be in classes next<br>week's o week uh we don't want you here<br>for o week um<br>the we've joined finnz as part of our<br>engagement in this and so you know I<br>read the emails that come through and<br>just the number of organizations that<br>are starting the startup system there<br>are these these fintech companies<br>bubbling up and I'm looking at this as<br>an nzn opportunity for us to be<br>leaders uh and yet um across the group<br>here feels like we're on slightly<br>different pages around the regulation<br>that um well have we got the regulatory<br>settings right for that and of course<br>people have different views can you give<br>me a taste Brook of what your what Your<br>your viewers of what kind of regulatory<br>settings would most help that fintech<br>environment Thrive for The Wider benefit<br>of the country yeah sure um to step out<br>you know there's predictions that the<br>tech industry as a whole will be New<br>Zealand's largest exporter by 2030<br>around 16 billion will be what it's<br>worth so investment in fintech is well<br>worth it for our ter and our um society<br>and on a global<br>stage um<br>there's a there's a few answers I have<br>to that and I think actually the first<br>one is that engagement which I I I<br>mostly mentioned before it's like yes<br>you know in order to Pro get the Q saer<br>license we had to go we had to get quite<br>a lot of exemptions through the current<br>um you know regime and and so work quite<br>closely with um the regulator on that<br>and and then you know come up with guard<br>rails and other ways that we make sure<br>that we're mitigating the risks so I<br>guess it's more you know if I look at it<br>holistically cross Regulators it is<br>taking a risk based approach rather than<br>rules based approach um and you can see<br>that through a lot of that impacts a lot<br>of uh regulations that fex b such as AML<br>I mean in Australia it's a it's way more<br>risk based I'd say than what we see here<br>and it's actually we're we're finding it<br>um more easier to comply over there than<br>what we find here um and that's just one<br>example uh but you know that's that's<br>what I saw was really good when we were<br>coming with these interesting<br>Innovations to the f with that that they<br>were up for having that conversation<br>going well how are you mitigating this<br>risk and well this way and you can do it<br>in a new way and that pushes um you know<br>the financial Innovation forward but<br>also pushes our a whole financial system<br>forward so that's one example and then<br>for the fintech um you know cohort in<br>particular I think if they have ideas<br>around um creating a fintech themselves<br>is like actually wo having relationships<br>with the FMA and rbnz or who might be<br>and honestly that just that can lead to<br>a lot of confidence in being able to um<br>you know make sure that you you you know<br>regulation is so crucial and I'm so glad<br>we're regulated it makes me sleep better<br>at night when we're managing a lot of<br>people's money to know that we're well<br>regulated and we're well audited and you<br>know I we you know personally and<br>obviously as a company we want that it's<br>just making sure that we can do it in a<br>way that drives the Innovation we need<br>to see and if I could answer that from a<br>open banking perspective I think for a<br>lot of fchs um the open banking regime<br>can't um come soon enough um there's a<br>lot of businesses that will be built off<br>um that that opportunity and so just<br>look at that a little bit more in detail<br>you've got two groups you've got what<br>they call the standard users which is<br>the finex that are looking to access<br>services and then you've got the API<br>providers which effectively is is the<br>banks and um those two parties need to<br>come together and agree what is the<br>framework of how these services will be<br>set up and accessed um what's the<br>application process and what's the<br>approval process for these you know new<br>finex coming coming in to access it um<br>there's a governance role there that<br>needs to be created uh that oversees<br>that process to make sure it's uh<br>independent and fair um you've got quite<br>a power imbalance between you know<br>startup organizations and and large<br>established Banks um in uh overseas<br>jurisdictions uh that has been trally<br>played by Regulators so um a regulator<br>in the UK and AIC in um the in Australia<br>um and we need to understand who can<br>best play that role uh in New Zealand uh<br>an organization called payments New<br>Zealand um has applied to the Commerce<br>Commission to play that role um I think<br>the challenge there is that payments New<br>Zealand is owned by the Banks um so the<br>banks coming in to play the government's<br>role in open banking um could be deemed<br>a conflict of interest um so there is<br>some discussion to be had and assessment<br>to be done on how best to set up a<br>structure in a government that works for<br>forward I'm very interested in your take<br>on this k<br>um yeah look uh you know there's<br>definitely um a clear role that needs to<br>be played there um you know and the<br>comcom uh is are the financial regulator<br>that is tasked of doing this piece of<br>work so um you know I can't comment on<br>on their approach uh to that uh one of<br>one of the things um you know from a<br>regulatory perspective that we uh as an<br>organization look at is is very much<br>understanding how regulation Works<br>globally and ensuring that we uh can<br>learn from others uh in terms of how<br>that is put together and I'm sure comca<br>are adopting a similar view so let's see<br>how that how that plays out but um the<br>concept of open banking I'm a firm<br>proponent at a personal level of uh I<br>think it offers a you know a fantastic<br>opportunity to just bring new ideas um<br>to at scale and you know it can support<br>uh fintech scalop pretty damn quickly<br>because you're in effect through apis<br>partnering with entities that already<br>have that customer scale story there and<br>I think you know from an accessibility<br>perspective it's a good start uh terms<br>of doing that so um that can only<br>benefit New Zealand moving forward right<br>can I then we're going to go down the<br>line because we're coming uh close to<br>the end and given your respective roles<br>I'll ask you slightly different<br>questions so for you Karen what are you<br>it's a similar thing we're looking at a<br>briefing to a new government you know<br>you're you're you're a part of that in a<br>sense what's what do you hope to be<br>looking back on for for empowering the<br>fintech sector um man managing a<br>transition to less cash and you know<br>supporting the prosperity of the country<br>what are you looking forward to most in<br>the next two three years um yeah uh so<br>as I said before there's the there's the<br>challenge that a regulator faces around<br>stat a statutory obligation that they<br>are required to meet and often that is<br>built around confidence trust resilience<br>sitting there<br>at the same time as um a<br>desirability to see more competition and<br>efficiency um if I'm standing back and<br>thinking about how the government can<br>think about that and engage in that is<br>to think about that challenge and<br>actually how they support the regulatory<br>bodies to navigate our way through that<br>space because uh when you have a<br>statutory<br>obligation you have a legal requirement<br>to meet that so<br>um an appreciation of of that will<br>actually in my view uh start to help<br>modernize uh the way we think about<br>regulation as an enabler because to<br>Brock's Point um and to a point that<br>Allison actually made really uh early uh<br>in the previous session or in the<br>infrastructure session regulation uh can<br>be an absolutely great thing in terms of<br>creating that confidence trust and peace<br>of mind even for you as the owner of<br>that business um at the same time it can<br>be a significant inhibitor if we end up<br>with the form of Regulation that isn't<br>serving the purpose that we need for<br>this economy to continue to evolve and<br>grow we need to do that we have a a a<br>payments um landscape that is<br>significantly behind uh many countries<br>around the globe uh and that's not just<br>developed countries that that certainly<br>you go to Afric you can do an awful lot<br>more than you can do here so so I'd like<br>that's what I want to say sounds the the<br>goil lock Zone not too tight not too not<br>too liberal and um and it means it's<br>hard which means it's hard all right<br>Shane youve got the magic governing<br>power for the next two three years what<br>do you want to see<br>change well I think uh if you look<br>globally at the new innovation and<br>services that have come through driven<br>by new technology and fintech um I it's<br>hard not to be really excited I think<br>for what the opportunity is here in New<br>Zealand I'd love to see finex um helping<br>drive a lot of new uh growth for<br>customers and growth in the industry and<br>that doesn't need to be fex by<br>themselves it could be fex with existing<br>uh players and other finex um Banks<br>Regulators Etc I think it'll take a a<br>village to to raise that child<br>opportunity um I think it takes um some<br>leadership I've always been inspired<br>what Brooke and the team have done at<br>sher's um led the way in a lot of ways<br>um I hope for us at do we can do the<br>same and um and then there'll be another<br>cohort of uh new players in the market<br>who come up with the next range of um<br>inspiring ideas and things that they can<br>do for for New Zealand so um for me the<br>it's all about uh the country getting in<br>behind I suppose some of the new<br>technology that's coming through and um<br>being eager to adopt change and try new<br>ways of doing things because um we are<br>on the back end of the world and<br>sometimes we can get a bit isolated and<br>sometimes maybe don't realize how far<br>we've actually fallen behind but there's<br>new really exciting ways of doing things<br>that um perhaps people in the room will<br>benefit from but really importantly the<br>Next Generation who are digital natives<br>the first truly digital generation uh<br>will rely on us to do that work still of<br>those outcomes so it's it's really<br>really important for uh the future um of<br>New Zealand brilliant sounds ambition<br>and uh ambition and energy to get stuff<br>done Brooke close us out with the next<br>two to three years what do you want to<br>see happen Okay next two to three years<br>um that's probably a bit too soon but<br>let's pretend um I would love to see<br>that everybody here in aloa is um feels<br>like they can and is developing wealth<br>for their for their long-term for the um<br>the generations to come in their family<br>that becomes normal that we understand<br>how that whole system works and that we<br>um and that it's actually you don't even<br>have to understand it because it's so<br>ingrained in terms of how we operate I'd<br>love um that freedom for so many more<br>people to have that um and then in terms<br>of for shes I think you know because I'm<br>you know I if I was a govern I guess I'd<br>still be thinking about shes um I would<br>you know I would love I think to see in<br>the next two to three years a real<br>Global fintech come out from Ala that's<br>really changing and shaping um you know<br>the world stage I'd love to see that um<br>it's really difficult it's really hard<br>I'm unsure if it's possible but there is<br>something I'd love to see you guys can<br>have a<br>competition all right look we we are at<br>uh we are at time but uh once again a<br>fascinating discussion amongst people<br>who know what you're talking about and<br>are challenging our thinking so please<br>put your hands together for the fintech<br>panel thank you thank<br>you all<br>right all right that uh brings us to the<br>conclusion of our panels and therefore<br>of the<br>2024 New Zealand economics Forum so I'm<br>going to mention a couple of things a<br>couple of thank yous and then draw<br>together some themes so first of all um<br>as I've chatted to people over a drun<br>last nighter and coffee breaks people<br>have said it's great to to come together<br>like this and I just want to acknowledge<br>the team that put this together as an<br>event you know the mechanics of that<br>you've seen people moving back and forth<br>behind stage so can we just have a round<br>of applause for those that have actually<br>event I think you think you've done an<br>exceptional job so well done to the team<br>second thanks to you as the audience uh<br>there uh many many people in this<br>audience and we we called on one of them<br>yesterday uh at short notice to fill in<br>when somebody missed a flight on the<br>taxt panel um there are many people in<br>this audience who are qualified uh<br>speakers and presenters as well this is<br>an incredible group of people so thank<br>you for engaging and for being a part of<br>this discussion your conversation is<br>kind of the point of this and thirdly a<br>brief reflection on what we've absorbed<br>and heard over the last couple of days<br>so just to give you a tour because it<br>can feel you know at the end of a day<br>and a half of content you think okay<br>that was quite a lot we have covered uh<br>the briefing from Nica Willis who's you<br>know a few weeks out from her first<br>budget as Finance Minister disruption of<br>agriculture culture our biggest sector<br>by a long margin health check uh what do<br>we need to be a healthier country<br>demographics our destiny tax social<br>investment what's the difference that'll<br>make trade and a divided World monetary<br>policy a discussion from Jim and Helen<br>last night the elders in the room<br>perhaps uh Adrian or this morning uh on<br>inflation and a review of the last<br>couple of years Carly Mich on Treasury<br>our fiscal situation the fiscal panel<br>which did turn a little bit into du<br>economists um but a great discussion uh<br>infrastructure climate and weather and<br>then fintech this is an enormous array<br>of topics to cover in a brief time and<br>so I say that just because it can be<br>hard when you've just heard the last two<br>panels to think about what you're doing<br>even 24 hours ago and the sheer amount<br>of information we're all trying to<br>absorb one thing that struck me and<br>right from the outset when Nicholas<br>spoke is that this disc is happening in<br>the backdrop of an environment with<br>enormous challenges and I think it's<br>pretty common now to hear words like<br>unprecedented and to feel that these are<br>challenges like we have never seen<br>before and of course they are because<br>every day is a new day and every day is<br>a day that uh we've never seen before<br>but to get the sense that they are<br>bigger than anybody else has faced<br>before and therefore it can feel<br>overwhel whelming and I think of what so<br>Brian mentioned around climate there and<br>I want to challenge that because when<br>you think back on the last 40<br>years I think 1980s early 80s then that<br>can feel true that can feel that wow<br>things things are really shaking up now<br>versus what we've known but take a<br>slightly longer view Helen mentioned<br>last night concept of leadership with a<br>Long View if you go back at previous 40<br>years so let's say 1940 to 1980<br>you imagine what happened in those years<br>World War II nuclear weapons used for<br>the first time the Cold War the rise of<br>the United States is an absolute<br>dominant force uh the changes then of<br>other things gender roles roles of how<br>households worked decolonization and<br>much of the world enormous change<br>enormous change go back another 40 years<br>we went from a 1900 to 1940 from horses<br>and carts on cobblestones to split fires<br>over Europe there was a World War the<br>pandemic of 1918 killed between 50 and<br>100 million people in some estimates<br>that was up to 2 and a half% of the<br>globe's population died uh the Great<br>Depression rise of fascism and communism<br>go back another 40 years and you'll have<br>another list of challenges you can<br>rattle off so I think for us it's<br>important not to think that while our<br>challenges are large they are unlike any<br>that have ever been faced or solved<br>before and that should leave us uh<br>coming out of a session like this glad<br>for the Insight but also optimistic for<br>the future because their big challenges<br>worry to create create quote sorry the<br>great economic thinker Steve Hansen<br>worry is a wasted emotion let's not<br>spend our time there let's think about<br>what we can do think deep and then get<br>into action and activity so um uh we<br>hope that the last two days have given<br>you all as leaders and influencers and<br>your roles in communities much to chew<br>over much to think about we hope that<br>you'll go back on Friday and talk to<br>your your teams or your spouses or your<br>children about uh some of the ideas that<br>have come up we hope you'll join uh the<br>right honorable Todd mlay and watching<br>all eight hours of yesterday's panels<br>again over the weekend to remember the<br>points you might have missed and uh my<br>last word for today is again a thank you<br>I want to thank those that have spoken<br>on stage today uh facilitators and and<br>panelists
