description available</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>you and Kor Coto good morning everyone<br>and it's a real pleasure to be here this<br>morning I wanted to congratulate the wut<br>management school for organizing this<br>form it really is becoming an important<br>fixture in the New Zealand economic and<br>political landscape it's great to hear<br>from uh Adrian on monetary policy and<br>I'm going to talk about its friend<br>fiscal policy uh I'd like to focus on a<br>quintessential challenge for any<br>treasury which is how to ensure that<br>fiscal policy is effective stabilizing<br>and sustainable the timing of this is<br>apt uh we recently released the<br>treasury's briefing to the incoming<br>minister or Bim that we provided to our<br>new Minister of Finance The Honorable<br>Nicola Willis who I know you had the<br>pleasure of hearing from yesterday and<br>so reflecting the advice contained<br>within our Bim I want to speak today<br>about the changing fiscal realities that<br>policy makers are faced with why<br>treasury believes that a period of<br>fiscal tightening is required now and<br>I'm also going to discuss our<br>institutions and how they could evolve<br>to meet some of our immediate and also<br>longer term<br>challenges so just a bit of scene<br>setting New Zealand is as you know<br>highly regarded internationally for the<br>quality of its Public Finance<br>institutions which emphasize<br>transparency accountability and<br>medium-term<br>sustainability the Public Finance Act of<br>1989 and the fiscal responsibility Act<br>of<br>1994 and all the rules that support them<br>set a benchmark for fiscal management<br>since their Inception 30 odd years ago<br>these have enabled governments to<br>prudently manage finances and support<br>the economy to improve the lives of uh<br>new zealanders now and into the future<br>and successive governments have<br>undertaken some really significant<br>fiscal repair following a large buildup<br>of debt in the 70s and the<br>80s net debt as you can see here was<br>managed down from around 50% of GDP in<br>1991 92 to around Z in 20072 2008 so<br>that's equivalent to about 5% on our<br>current net debt measure gross debt<br>peaked at over 70% of GDP in<br>1987 so these lower levels of government<br>debt and a stronger Crown balance sheet<br>enable governments to provide support to<br>the economy through some pretty large<br>economic shocks and natural disasters<br>while still maintaining a sound position<br>lower debt also lowers the risk premium<br>in interest rates and supporting higher<br>living<br>standards but even just this chart also<br>points to some emerging challenges for<br>fiscal policy in New Zealand the policy<br>responses to the global financial crisis<br>canbury earthquakes and especially now<br>the pandemic have led to a rise in<br>public debt now in and of itself that's<br>not necessarily a concern since the<br>level of debt in New Zealand is still<br>relatively low and we a treasury uh<br>consider that current levels remain<br>prudent<br>but the bigger concern is that the<br>trajectory of the debt uh is rising and<br>operating expenditure has cons continued<br>to exceed revenue on an ongoing<br>basis this was the case even through a<br>period in which the economy was<br>overheating and employment was at<br>generational lows which is normally a<br>time when we expect fiscal policy to be<br>at its<br>tightest fiscal policy has been<br>tightening but not rapidly enough for<br>fiscal policy to make it optimal<br>contribution to stabilizing the<br>macroeconomy and so the first part of my<br>remarks today are going to focus on that<br>stabilization<br>role second I want to speak about the<br>sustainability of fiscal policy as New<br>Zealand is running deficits throughout<br>the economic cycle the country is now<br>best described as having a structural<br>fiscal<br>deficit now that's going to prove<br>unsustainable unless change is made um<br>and there's change that's outlined in<br>the treasury's current forecast for the<br>return to Surplus structural def<br>deficits increase vulnerability to the<br>fiscal impacts of natural disasters and<br>other economic shocks they increase debt<br>servicing costs and they shift costs to<br>Future generations and ultimately reduce<br>government's ability to provide Public<br>Services running sustainable fiscal<br>policy imposes constraints on revenue<br>and on spending the third part of my<br>speech will talk about the structure of<br>fiscal policy how governments can get<br>the best value from their limited<br>resources in order to living standards<br>and achieve their<br>priorities the final part of my speech<br>will outline how we can strengthen the<br>fiscal institutions that have served New<br>Zealand well for the past few decades<br>doing so will help to promote<br>transparency accountability and<br>performance of government um but I would<br>add just a cautionary note although<br>strengthening our institutions is<br>important will make a difference doing<br>so alone is not going to solve our<br>challenges new zealanders and the<br>representatives we elect to to make<br>decisions on our behalf do have some<br>tough decisions and some big trade-offs<br>to make in the coming years on what we<br>value what we want to prioritize and by<br>implication what we attach less value<br>to so first let me turn to fiscal policy<br>and its contribution to stabilizing the<br>economy generally macroeconomic<br>stabilization is best achieved through<br>monetary policy we just heard from<br>Adrian about that rather than fiscal<br>policy which involves government<br>decisions on spending and<br>Taxation early in the covid-19 pandemic<br>however it was clear that a monetary<br>policy response alone would not be<br>sufficient to confront the scale and the<br>nature of the shock especially with the<br>OCR already near its effective lower<br>bound fiscal policy played a critical<br>role in the resilience of the economy<br>through the pandemic and we saw you know<br>one of the big lessons was just we saw<br>how quickly and effectively fiscal<br>policy could be deployed to Target needs<br>the wage subsid other economic supports<br>helped to keep people in jobs helped to<br>keep businesses running funding enabled<br>an effective Health response and<br>increases to benefits other welfare<br>spend help to support some vulnerable<br>people the size of the fiscal response<br>was<br>unprecedented with both the deficit and<br>debt increasing sharply the accounts<br>move from a surplus of 2.4% of GDP in<br>2019 to a deficit of 7.3% of GDP in 2020<br>now treasury's fiscal policy advice at<br>this time emphasized that an effective<br>fiscal stimulus is one that is temporary<br>targeted And<br>Timely while fiscal policy was supported<br>with strong recovery from the pandemic<br>we also experien some of its<br>limitations following the initial shock<br>from the pandemic the New Zealand<br>economy recovered very rapidly during<br>2021 annual GDP growth peaked at over 6%<br>house price inflation peaked at over 30%<br>% perom by 2022 the unemployment rate<br>had fallen to record lows. 2% and the<br>resulting inflationary pressure was<br>compounded by restrictions on Supply<br>imposed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine<br>Global shortage of shipping capacity and<br>then of course the effects of Cy Cyclone<br>Gabrielle and the<br>floods CPI inflation increased to<br>7.3% Mid 2022 and those imbalances were<br>also reflected in the current account<br>deficit which widened to 8.8% of GDP in<br>December<br>2022 and so over this period we're<br>reminded that fiscal policy is typically<br>easier to loosen in a downturn than it<br>is to tighten in an upt unlike monetary<br>policy fiscal policy often involved<br>programs where spending is spread over<br>many years and is therefore hard to<br>reverse events of the day typically put<br>governments under renewed pressure to<br>spend rather than to<br>consolidate at the treasury our ass is<br>that about a third of the increase in<br>inflation following the pandemic could<br>be attributed to demand factors a third<br>to supply constraints and the<br>attribution of the final third is<br>uncertain while that final third and the<br>breakdown of demand is uncertain our<br>assessment is that fiscal policy has had<br>an impact on inflation my general rule<br>of thumb based on International and<br>domestic evidence is that additional<br>fiscal stimulus equivalent to 1% of GDP<br>would cause the OCR to rise by an<br>additional 30 basis points there's very<br>much Ru of thumb there's a wide range of<br>estimates in the literature the nature<br>of the shock matters of course as does<br>the specific form of any fiscal stimulus<br>or contraction and there's great<br>variation within different types of<br>categories of fiscal stimulus so it's<br>just a rule of<br>thumb um attributing interest rates<br>interest rate increases to fiscal<br>stimulus is further Complicated by the<br>up and down nature of spending and tax<br>taxation through the pandemic as<br>Illustrated in the treasury's estimate<br>of the fiscal impulse which measures the<br>impact of fiscal policy on aggregate<br>demand compared to the previous<br>year some years fiscal policy was<br>subtracting from demand pressures in the<br>economy in part because of the temporary<br>support measures that came to an end but<br>all up our assessment is that fiscal<br>policy has contributed to interest rates<br>being higher than otherwise it's not the<br>main driver but it certainly was a<br>factor among many other<br>factors although the economy is expected<br>to slow in the next two years our<br>assessment of current macroeconomic<br>pressures and the fact that the current<br>fiscal deficit is structural meant that<br>in our Bim we recommended that<br>government should prioritize a return to<br>a<br>surplus this is going to require<br>substantial fiscal consolidation to<br>bring revenue and expenses back into<br>balance doing so will support fiscal<br>sustainability which I'll discuss<br>shortly and importantly it will support<br>monetary policy to bring inflation back<br>into the target range higher government<br>savings is also going to contribute to<br>narrowing the current account deficit<br>it recent treasury economic and fiscal<br>updates underpinned by treasury's<br>economic forecasts and the plans of the<br>previous and current government are<br>consistent with this view the forecast<br>assume an extended period of tight<br>fiscal management that would see a<br>substantial decline in real government<br>consumption and it's similar to size<br>just to kind size it it's similar to the<br>decrease in the early 1990s but over a<br>shorter time<br>frame the asymmetry of fiscal policy so<br>the fact that it's easier to spend than<br>to cut reinforces fiscal policy should<br>be used judiciously in macroeconomic<br>stabilization in parent this means<br>having a clear understanding of the<br>respective roles of monetary policy and<br>fiscal policy in different scenarios and<br>also a really good common understanding<br>across authorities of the policy toolkit<br>to use the one that is best suited for<br>the range of shocks that we<br>expect it also means recognizing and<br>acting on the strengths and the<br>limitations of fiscal policy for example<br>for example this means this may mean<br>relying more on automatic stabilizers<br>such as payments and taxes linked to the<br>economic cycle or semi-automatic<br>stabilizers so the wage subsidy is a<br>good example of a semi-automatic<br>stabilizer where funding is only<br>released when certain conditions are met<br>in that case related to pandemic<br>restrictions and it may mean relying<br>less On Tools like increases in<br>infrastructure and core government<br>spending as a response to Big downturns<br>because they come with really<br>significant lags and they're quite<br>difficult to withdraw after the fact so<br>we're currently investing a lot of time<br>and effort in researching these<br>questions in the treasury as we prepare<br>for the next inevitable shocks and<br>working with our colleagues in The<br>Reserve Bank on how we might coordinate<br>in a<br>response so I'm now going to turn to the<br>question of long run sustainability of<br>fiscal policy between 2019 and 2023 the<br>IMF estimates that the New Zealand<br>government's net debt increased by 18%<br>of GDP compared with a 4% increase for<br>the average Advanced economy so it was a<br>really big<br>stimulus despite this increase treasury<br>does consider that the current level of<br>debt is still prudent we did extensive<br>analysis on debt sustainability in 20122<br>and we concluded that even in a scenario<br>of High real interest rates and modest<br>GDP growth it would be technically<br>possible to recover from debt levels<br>near the average of IMF advanced<br>economies which is around 90% of GDP<br>although of course much depends on the<br>willingness of governments to run<br>meaningful and significant surpluses<br>after the response to large<br>shocks the sustainability of Any Given<br>level of debt depends on a range of<br>factors but the most important are the<br>interest rate on the debt and the growth<br>rate of the economy higher economic<br>growth allows a country to grow its way<br>out of debt while higher interest rates<br>increase government expenses and make<br>debt debt consolidation harder the<br>decade following the global financial<br>crisis featured steadily falling<br>interest rates which have improved the<br>sustainability of government debt<br>however interest rates have increased as<br>we all know in recent years Finance<br>costs in uh the crown accounts have<br>increased from a low of 1.9 billion in<br>21 to 6.6 billion in 2023 and their<br>forecast will be $8.8<br>billion um in uh by the end of the<br>forecast period it's 2.1% of GDP that's<br>near the level of the late<br>1990s so it's hard to disentangle how<br>much of the interest rate is temp<br>increase is temporary and how much will<br>prove lasting but it's worth noting that<br>estimates of neutral interest rates have<br>risen treasury's estimates of where the<br>New Zealand government's 10-year bond<br>yield will settle have only increased a<br>little since 2022 but nonetheless we<br>expect interest rates to be higher than<br>the ultr low rates that prevailed pre<br>pandemic future GDP growth is of course<br>difficult predict to predict but between<br>population aging climate change Global<br>productivity Slowdown GE geopolitical<br>fragmentation Prudence would suggest<br>that we borrow only what we can afford<br>to repay in a modest growth future so we<br>really should not be relying on<br>favorable debt dynamics that we've had<br>going<br>forward over the long run fiscal<br>sustainability depends not just on<br>today's debt level but on the trajectory<br>of debt over time and it's here where we<br>see New Zealand is facing greater<br>challenges New Zealand publishes a<br>long-term fiscal statement every four<br>years assessing a fiscal Outlook over a<br>period of at least 40 years years ahead<br>outlining possible Trends in spending in<br>Revenue the operating balance and debt<br>the last statement Illustrated that<br>historical policy settings our core<br>Crown expenditure will significantly<br>outpace Revenue over coming<br>decades new zealanders are on average<br>living longer and healthier lives and<br>that's a great thing but combined with<br>Ong gring increases in health spending<br>and superannuation it's likely to put a<br>lot of pressure on public finances over<br>the longer term the statement highlights<br>that a packeted measures would be<br>necessary over time to stabilize net<br>debt but the balance of policy measures<br>is largely a value judgment for<br>governments looking forward to the next<br>statement which is due out next year<br>working on it now many of the risks that<br>we've outlined in past statements are<br>starting to play out now the Aging of<br>the population for example is upon us<br>now gross New Zealand superannuation<br>benefits costs about $20 billion last<br>year and if you exclude budget decisions<br>they're the fastest growing EXP item<br>across the forecast period projected to<br>rise to 7.7% of GDP by<br>2061 Health costs have risen 1.3<br>percentage points to 7.2% of GDP over<br>the last few years and they're also<br>projected to rise to 10% of GDP by<br>20161 we've also recently experienced<br>how climate change is likely to impose<br>large fiscal and economic costs as well<br>as devastating human environmental and<br>social costs both now and into the<br>future we estimate that the cost of<br>economic cost of cyclone Gabrielle in<br>the floods is somewhere between 9 and 14<br>odd billion dollar um government's<br>allocated already 4.7 billion to the<br>response to date and insurance claims<br>top some $3.5 billion and as we know<br>these severe weather events are only<br>going to get more frequent and uh worse<br>we're experiencing the best best weather<br>we're going to see in our lifetimes now<br>in addition to these long-standing<br>issues new challenges have risen in<br>prominence these include increasing<br>geopolitical risks which have<br>implications for international<br>connectedness as well as National and<br>economic security it's already dampening<br>economic growth prospects via<br>deterioration in trade opportunities at<br>the term of trade terms of trade<br>government's finances could also be<br>direct directly affected if a less<br>secure World leads to more defense and<br>security spending so these challenges<br>aging of the population climate change<br>uh geopolitical fragmentation they<br>really illustrate that achieving<br>sustainability in our public finances<br>are going to require either is going to<br>require either tight control of<br>expenditure growth stronger re Revenue<br>growth or both the ongoing nature of<br>population change um climate change and<br>shifting geopolitics implies that there<br>will be a structural generational<br>challenge so that takes me to the<br>structure of fiscal policy the<br>composition or allocation of government<br>spending and Taxation and how that<br>matters for productivity and overall<br>living standards there are often<br>trade-offs in setting policy fiscal<br>policy to achieve macroeconomic<br>stability and sustainability goals on<br>the one hand and then also the desire to<br>uh meet government objectives and to<br>improve living standards and in today's<br>context you know a faster consolidation<br>will support monetary policy to bring<br>down inflation and improve<br>sustainability but it may pose tradeoffs<br>with government services and priorities<br>and so that's sort of the key<br>consideration in uh setting Targets on<br>the return to<br>Surplus our Bim highlights some recent<br>Trends in New Zealand fcal structure the<br>first point to note is that both<br>government expenditure and government<br>revenue have increased in other words<br>government's now playing a bigger role<br>in the economy than it used to core<br>Crown expenditure averaged about 30% of<br>GDP between 94 and 2019 but it's now<br>about<br>32% and at the same time core Crown<br>Revenue has been rising as a percent of<br>GDP from<br>28.4% in 2023 to around 30% uh estimated<br>in the next 5 years now as people here<br>in this room would know there's no<br>consensus on the optimal size of<br>government there's a wide range within<br>the oecd for example and similarly the<br>goals of fiscal policy involve value<br>judgments that are best made by elected<br>officials our emphasis in treasury is on<br>ensuring that government revenue and<br>expenditure is efficient and effective<br>at achieving the outcomes desired by<br>government on behalf of<br>society the second point I want to make<br>on the structure of spend is about the<br>question where is all the spending gone<br>recently<br>I've already mentioned increases in<br>superannuation and health spending<br>relative to<br>GDP however these areas are not the only<br>ones in which spending has grown total<br>fiscal position has also been influenced<br>by rapid spending growth in a lot of<br>smaller areas such as Early Childhood<br>Corrections where they're taking an<br>increasing share of the budget looking<br>at the structure by of spending by how<br>it's administered in recent years we<br>also see that core government Department<br>spending has increased but by far the<br>biggest dollar growth has been in areas<br>outside of core uh public sector<br>departmental spending that includes<br>activities in areas like transport<br>housing Health and Welfare and<br>importantly these are areas where<br>government has less direct levers for<br>fiscal control as most involve Crown<br>entities which operate with just that<br>little bit more Independence than core<br>government<br>departments the growth in expenditure<br>also raises important questions about<br>how costs and benefits are balanced<br>across different groups so for example<br>this chart shows that relative to other<br>welfare benefits given its Universal<br>nature New Zealand superannuation<br>spending is widely distributed across<br>different income groups it's a<br>significant source of government<br>transfers for higher income new<br>zealanders in contrast average working<br>age support things like working for<br>families payments housing support are<br>more Progressive a decline steadily with<br>increasing income<br>desiles as the population ages under<br>current policy settings we can EXP<br>expect to see an increasing proportion<br>of government transfers to higher income<br>new<br>zealanders efficiency and value for<br>money can and should contribute to<br>fiscal sustainability as Ernest<br>Rutherford said we don't have much money<br>so we're going to have to think and<br>government departments are uh now<br>working very hard to identify<br>efficiencies and productivity<br>improvements but even with this hard<br>distributional cause will be inevitable<br>going forward because most expenditure<br>goes to transfers and public services<br>like health and education at some point<br>we're going to have to decide as a<br>country how to share the cost of fiscal<br>sustainability between young old working<br>AED new<br>zealanders there are also important<br>trade-offs to be considered for<br>government revenue personal income tax<br>makes up 53% of New Zealand's Revenue<br>system it's more than most other oecd<br>countries there are constraints on a<br>personal tax system which are limiting<br>the options for reform most prominently<br>the difference between our personal and<br>our company tax rates and the lack of a<br>capital gains tax<br>for example differences in rates between<br>company and personal tax limits the<br>ability to raise revenue or reduces or<br>reduce the company tax rate as income<br>can be sheltered in um in<br>companies the lack of a comprehensive<br>capital gains tax increases the economic<br>cost of income taxation distorts the<br>allocation of resources within the<br>economy and restricts the option to<br>manage gaps between company and personal<br>tax rates based on principles such as<br>efficiency sustainability and fairness<br>ESS treasury's are long-standing and<br>first best advice is to address these<br>two structural issues in the tax system<br>major tax changes of course take time to<br>implement so there's a need to plan for<br>these uh early and ultimately there's<br>are choices for elected officials we'll<br>have more to say on the long-term fiscal<br>Outlook in next year's uh long-term<br>fiscal<br>statement so let me move on to uh last<br>topic I wanted to cover which is<br>strengthening fiscal<br>institutions to make those quality<br>decisions<br>that support fiscal stability uh<br>sustainability and the contribution of<br>fiscal policy to living standards and to<br>understand the trade-offs between those<br>goals we need to ensure better demand<br>quality fiscal<br>institutions by institutions I don't<br>just mean organizations I mean the laws<br>the regulations and the ways of working<br>the whole system that supports decision-<br>making and understanding of public<br>finances so give an example some have<br>proposed an independent Finance<br>institution IFI as a way to sharpen<br>fiscal discipline accountability but<br>when we compare the features of ifis<br>across countries the Public Finance act<br>already assigns many importantly not all<br>IFI functions to existing parts in the<br>New Zealand system so for example the<br>treasury is responsible for preparing<br>forecasts and long-term fiscal<br>projections independently to government<br>so without getting into the debate um<br>it's an important debate to have we take<br>a broad view of reforming institutions<br>one that looks at the system as a whole<br>and not just at um the organizational<br>level now New Zealand's Public Finance<br>system has great strengths especially in<br>promoting transparency and<br>accountability and we don't want to lose<br>those but it's widely agreed that<br>there's room for improvement and a need<br>to adapt to today's challenges<br>treasury's Bim outlines what we're doing<br>to uh invent some shifts in the Public<br>Finance system we're working towards a<br>system that increasingly focuses on<br>delivering on outcomes for new<br>zealanders and results as well as<br>managing the dollars focusing more on<br>long-term issues as well as annual<br>budgets deepening our consideration and<br>understanding of public sector finances<br>as a whole not just the incremental<br>annual budget spending so the 10440<br>billion of expenditure not just a few<br>billion dollars of new of of of new<br>spending and allowances and also<br>focusing on more joined up approaches<br>across the public sector to deliver<br>better results and break down those<br>agency<br>silos within those long-term goals we're<br>working on uh shifts to uh to to uh<br>support those core principles underlying<br>the Public Finance act transparency and<br>accountability with measures that can<br>help government to best navigate the<br>tighter fiscal environment ahead getting<br>more value for money out of our<br>expenditure will be critical to managing<br>to expenditure targets and creating the<br>fiscal Headroom for future investment so<br>we're improving accountability by<br>strengthening Performance Management<br>Systems tightening the rules and<br>enforcement around around investment<br>disciplines we're helping to enhance<br>transparency by expanding reporting to<br>show where the dollars are going uh<br>beyond the current level of<br>Appropriations to reporting on programs<br>and funds it's a huge constraint to<br>understanding where the dollars are<br>going and what they're delivering we're<br>providing more information on risks in<br>the fiscal Outlook undertaking spending<br>and performance reviews of agencies to<br>more actively manage risks and<br>performance and encourage continual rep<br>prioritizations to programs that work<br>and the productive capacity of the<br>economy with new data technology better<br>analytics this is actually quite an<br>exciting space for the treasury our<br>emphasis is on rigor and uh evidence and<br>strong Frameworks including the<br>treasury's living standards framework to<br>help decision makers get a comprehensive<br>view of the impact of the choices that<br>they face including over time and across<br>a range of<br>outcomes so just to sum up New Zealand<br>has a strong track record over success<br>of governments of maintaining sound<br>public<br>finances this record and the supporting<br>fiscal Frameworks contribute to Market<br>and rating confidence in New Zealand's<br>long-term fiscal sustainability and<br>thereby supporting growth we're not<br>alone in facing fiscal challenges and<br>many countries are facing similar issues<br>post pandemic and we're all pretty much<br>facing those growing pressures<br>associated with climate change aging<br>populations and increasing geopolitical<br>risks in the near term our Frameworks<br>have delivered a government balance<br>sheet that has allowed governments to<br>deal with some of the really large<br>shocks that we faced and minimize the<br>negative impact on living standards but<br>I want to conclude today with a point<br>that uh these challenges are not about<br>the distant future the long-term fiscal<br>pressures that treasury's been calling<br>attention to for some time now are here<br>now and these challenges are being<br>exacerbated by the structural deficit<br>that has emerged in recent years I'm<br>really confident that we can meet these<br>fiscal challenges but doing so will<br>require continued action over both the<br>short and the long term we're working at<br>treasury to build on the best of the<br>Public Finance system that has served<br>New Zealand so well so it lifts our<br>fiscal performance in the near term and<br>continues to support governments to<br>address those big complex challenges in<br>Kora well thank you so much Carol for<br>your keyote address we've just got one<br>or two minutes so just um we we've got<br>lots of questions that have come through<br>we're not going have time for all of<br>them I'm sorry but we have got a panel<br>following um I wonder Carly um if you<br>have any comment on the current labor<br>market recent migration numbers and what<br>this means for underlying fiscal<br>pressures over the next two to three<br>years oh thank you yes and we're in the<br>process now of updating our forecast for<br>the uh budget that will be released at<br>the end of May and so examining all of<br>these um the more recent data um<br>releases in in some detail and I guess<br>we're seeing um some some opposing<br>forces really on the one hand we've had<br>GDP turnouts coming a bit lower than<br>expected and uh that's obviously going<br>to have implications for our Revenue as<br>well as um our overall economic<br>forecasts on the other hand we see quite<br>a bit of strength particularly coming<br>through in migration although there's<br>quite a bit of volatility in migration<br>data as uh as well uh and employment<br>labor market data came out a little bit<br>stronger than expected so you know there<br>is still quite a bit of uncertainty and<br>volatility in the data um we're seeing<br>you know different forces at play and uh<br>taking all of that into account in our<br>forecast but look overall the big<br>picture is that the economy is slowing<br>and slowing really in line with what we<br>have forecast today uh demand is coming<br>down closer to supply and that's going<br>to support uh lower uh inflation so ups<br>and downs at the margin but um the<br>overall trend is is is<br>clear and just one more question um that<br>ties in very much to how you introduced<br>your session following Adrian's address<br>this morning is better coordination of<br>monetary and fiscal policy any more<br>complicated than an inflation Target and<br>adherence to fiscal responsibility<br>principles so is that coordination going<br>to make life much more complicated than<br>the two two more separate targets I<br>think that the coordinations is going to<br>make life a lot simpler and um you know<br>we work really effectively with our uh<br>colleagues across the road and are<br>working hard to strengthen channels for<br>coordinating fiscal and monetary policy<br>and I think it's possible to do so while<br>respecting the very different channels<br>of decision making monetary policy very<br>importantly needs to have Independence<br>in its decision making it's the monetary<br>policy committee that is responsible for<br>the operationalization of uh of monetary<br>policy and fiscal policy of course is a<br>responsibility of elected officials so<br>we can respect those different channels<br>and the Independence that built into the<br>system but at the same time make sure<br>that there's good information sharing a<br>common understanding of different types<br>of tools so that uh we know that<br>monetary policy and fiscal policy are<br>ideally working in the same direction we<br>hopefully have a sense of the magnitude<br>of the two together when we make our<br>respective decisions and also really<br>importantly understanding whether we've<br>got the right tools for the job so we've<br>got a number of really effective<br>mechanisms treasury is an observer uh on<br>the monetary policy committee effective<br>mechanism for coordination we've got<br>some uh joint work and understanding<br>housing markets for example so that um<br>we each have uh an idea of how decisions<br>in one sphere can affect the likely um<br>necessary response in the other sphere<br>and uh you know we continue to have good<br>exchanges at all levels of the<br>organization but to to the question I<br>think that's actually going to help<br>simplify things and make more effective<br>responses to downturns and macroeconomic<br>stabilization in the<br>future well thank you very much that's a<br>really posi note to uh end your address<br>on and uh it's been a real treat for us<br>this morning isn't it to have uh leaders<br>from both uh Reserve Bank and from the<br>New Zealand treasury joining us for<br>these keynote addresses so once again<br>thank you so much Carol and we'll invite<br>stage</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
