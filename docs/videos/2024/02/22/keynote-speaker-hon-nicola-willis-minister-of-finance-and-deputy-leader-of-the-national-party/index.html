0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>TI it's great to be back at the New<br>Zealand economics Forum I'd like to<br>acknowledge everyone here today for your<br>expertise and contribution especially<br>the pro Vice Chancellor Matt buer and my<br>former colleague from fontia<br>head of the wo management School<br>Economist students uh the honorable<br>Steven Joyce uh Hamilton May Paula<br>Southgate and wper may Susan<br>oan a year has passed since I was last<br>before you and the challenges the New<br>Zealand economy faced then still Loom<br>large today the good news is these days<br>I don't just get to talk about those<br>challenges today I'm part of a new<br>government with a massive opportunity to<br>do something about them since being<br>sworn in two and a half months ago the<br>coalition government has been working<br>hard to rebuild confidence in the<br>economy and to restore fiscal discipline<br>this work is essential and urgent we<br>have inherited an unhappy mix of high<br>inflation High interest rates a<br>Contracting economy and Rising<br>unemployment the government books have<br>deteriorated with deficits since the<br>2019 2020 fiscal year and a return to a<br>way for thin Surplus not forecast until<br>2026<br>27 and that's before we consider the<br>Litany of fiscal risks Cliffs and<br>unfunded commitments our government has<br>inherited from the outgoing<br>Administration since the halfe update<br>Before Christmas data revisions and<br>outturns have thrown yet more doubt on<br>both the growth trajectory for the New<br>Zealand economy and the fiscal<br>situation that will be of concern to<br>workers families and businesses<br>alike we are conscious that any<br>worsening forecasts could well lead to a<br>further decline in government revenue<br>projections and a correspondingly weaker<br>set of government books for us to work<br>with monthly updates and there is one<br>out today May well bounce around a bit<br>but our cautious view is that the<br>emerging data suggests it is highly<br>unlikely that the full set of forecasts<br>in May will deliver any upside surprises<br>when compared to the halfe<br>update but as Finance Minister I am<br>embracing the adage that every challenge<br>contains<br>opportunity opportunity for our<br>government to better protect taxpayers<br>money and purchasing power opportunity<br>to deliver better results from public<br>services and opportunity to create the<br>conditions needed to unlock New<br>Zealand's untapped growth<br>potential I will be releasing a budget<br>policy statement on the 27th of March<br>you can expect these priorities to be<br>reflected there we will also take that<br>opportunity to set out in more detail<br>our short-term fiscal intentions and<br>longer term Fiscal objectives before<br>delivering our first Budget on the 30th<br>of May the work of better economic<br>management is already very much underway<br>and our first 100 days the coalition<br>government is acting decisively to<br>deliver a stronger found foundation for<br>New Zealand's future economic<br>performance we are acutely conscious<br>that it is the strength of our economy<br>that would determine the standard of<br>living available to new zealanders their<br>job and business opportunities their<br>purchasing power and the quality of<br>Public Services they can rely on New<br>Zealand cannot become richer by simply<br>taxing spending borrowing and regulating<br>more instead we must grow the productive<br>capacity of our<br>economy in recent years careless<br>economic management by government has<br>had a profoundly negative impact on New<br>Zealand's living standards kiwis have<br>endured a prolonged cost of living<br>crisis as high inflation High housing<br>costs and Rising interest rates have<br>eaten away at their<br>incomes and that's why you've seen our<br>government move swiftly to refocus The<br>Reserve Bank on a single inflation<br>busting mandate getting inflation back<br>to Target is the essential foundation<br>for sustainable economic<br>recovery kiwi workers have have also<br>experienced a period during which<br>government has been spending at<br>historically elevated levels without<br>delivering any corresponding Improvement<br>in the Public Services it delivers new<br>zealanders are paying higher average<br>rates of personal tax and have little to<br>show for it despite a more than 80%<br>increase in annual government<br>expenditure expected between 2017 and<br>2024 Hospital waiting lists have<br>lengthened education results have<br>declined and violent crime has risen<br>government debt has soed largely through<br>increased<br>spending our manyi budget Before<br>Christmas delivered an initial $7.5<br>billion in operating savings and<br>additional revenue and all ministers are<br>working hard to stop low value<br>government programs and go nowhere<br>projects to reduce fiscal risks and<br>drive resources out of back office<br>bureaucracy and into the front line stop<br>work notices on doomed projects like<br>Lake onow and the income Insurance<br>scheme have already freed up resources<br>for better uses extensive work is<br>underway to ensure government agencies<br>are driving maximum value for taxpayers<br>money minimizing back offer spend with<br>all agencies expected to deliver a<br>savings<br>dividend we are developing a set of<br>better Public Service targets to measure<br>our performance and drive<br>progress at the same time we are doing a<br>health check on major government<br>infrastructure projects to minimize the<br>risk risk of the massive cost blowouts<br>and delays that have become far too<br>common in recent<br>years I view this program of work I have<br>just described as the bread and butter<br>of responsible government it is no<br>different to what any household or<br>business does when its finances come<br>under strain it is necessary in fact it<br>should be<br>routine but in itself it will not<br>deliver on our aspirations for the New<br>Zealand<br>economy because our Ambitions are much<br>Bolder than simply delivering a better<br>set of<br>books instead our goal is to make this a<br>much wealthier country where new<br>zealanders can earn more live better and<br>expect greater opportunities for our<br>children and<br>grandchildren and we as a government are<br>not content to allow New Zealand to<br>stagnate and slip further behind the<br>rest of the world we look at countries<br>like Ireland Singapore and<br>Australia and see that faster growth and<br>greater Prosperity are the essential<br>ingredients for better living standards<br>and choices we want that for kiwis and<br>we have every reason to believe it is<br>possible but a new economic approach is<br>needed New Zealand has so many of the<br>raw ingredients<br>already here we are two major Islands<br>located in the fastest growing region of<br>the world with a stable democracy and<br>peaceful borders blessed with extensive<br>natural resources that give us the<br>capacity for abundant renewable energy<br>and sustain aable food<br>production populated by people hardwired<br>for creativity and Innovation with<br>extensive trade connections and<br>potential for more home to entrepreneurs<br>and established firms leading the world<br>in Pursuits ranging from digital effects<br>and online accounting to Rocket<br>launching and infant formula<br>production there is so much going for us<br>and yet New Zealand has not been<br>converting these strengths into the<br>levels of productivity and success our<br>country<br>deserves our coalition government is<br>determined to turn that around we want<br>our country to be seen as a Haven for<br>talent capital and<br>Innovation open for business and hungry<br>for investment the make it happen<br>capital of the Asia Pacific<br>to achieve that aspiration we must fix a<br>huge array of policies that have made<br>New Zealand an increasingly difficult<br>place in which to build and make things<br>in which to hire people to invest to<br>innovate to do<br>business so work is underway across<br>government to tune up New Zealand's<br>growth engine by removing golow<br>regulations lifting education standards<br>growing export opportunities attract ing<br>investment encouraging Innovation and<br>building the transport connections<br>energy generation housing and modern<br>infrastructure needed to support a<br>faster growing<br>economy we've made it easier to hire<br>someone new by bringing back 90-day<br>trials for large<br>employers our Minister for regulation<br>The Honorable David Seymour has been<br>given a new mandate to Seek and Destroy<br>productivity sapping red tape with a<br>wide ranging brief to remove and reform<br>the heavy regulatory blanket that has<br>increasingly smothered New Zealand's<br>entrepreneurial Spirit our prime<br>minister foreign trade and defense<br>ministers have been actively nurturing<br>our International relationships and<br>opening the doors to new trade<br>opportunities we want to see New Zealand<br>made products and services reaching more<br>consumers around the world we've removed<br>the Byzantine so-called FPA regime which<br>threatened to impose mandatory one-size<br>fits all Union driven employment<br>contracts across entire<br>Industries we're bringing the basics<br>back to our schools with requirements<br>that each School teach at least an hour<br>of reading writing and maths every day<br>and we've brought in a cell phone band<br>to ensure kids can focus on learning<br>that has made me very unpopular with my<br>13-year-old but it's a good thing<br>regardless we've removed the UT tax and<br>will soon remove the ockland regional<br>fuel tax we've restored a 2-year bright<br>line test for the sale of Residential<br>Properties removing the capital gains<br>tax by stealth that the previous<br>government introduced through its<br>10-year<br>rule we have repealed the extraordinary<br>threat to growth and development posed<br>by Labor's RMA<br>2.0 we are on track to implement further<br>Resource Management reform to make it<br>easier to consent major projects attract<br>investment and encourage Housing<br>Development that includes introducing a<br>FastTrack One-Stop shop consenting<br>process so that New Zealand can welcome<br>in major development projects with less<br>time wasted in hearings appeals and<br>lawyers<br>offices this work is absolutely critical<br>to speeding up investment in much needed<br>energy generation to reduce emissions<br>and deliver on our climate change<br>commitments to deliver better transport<br>connections large scale housing<br>developments and more and we've been<br>delighted to see that our progrowth<br>agenda has already injected optimism<br>into the economy with businesses<br>reporting higher levels of confidence<br>about the future than seen in many years<br>we will keep working at PACE to deliver<br>change as we move beyond our first 100<br>days I will convene a group of economic<br>ministers who will be charged with<br>driving progress working closely with<br>businesses to ensure our work is making<br>it easier for the people we serve and to<br>ensure the world knows that New Zealand<br>is well and truly open for<br>business I am excited about this work<br>and the potential it has to open up a<br>new chapter in the New Zealand story and<br>I look forward to hearing the views of<br>our Economic and Business Leaders many<br>of whom are here today to hear about the<br>areas you want highlighted for Rapid<br>reform we are a government of action and<br>we will be bold it is time to be bold to<br>remove barriers and embrace<br>ambition before I I close my remarks<br>today though I want to share with you my<br>commitment to another area of work that<br>I see as crucial to unlocking New<br>Zealand's<br>potential and that is social investment<br>I note you have a panel on this subject<br>later<br>today for me the ultimate purpose of a<br>strong economy is to deliver better for<br>people to improve their choices<br>opportunities and and the quality of<br>their everyday lives not just for the<br>lucky few but to lift the prospects of<br>all but as we meet here today we all<br>know there are groups of new zealanders<br>Who Remain locked out of the<br>opportunities a modern economy should<br>bring kiwis whose human potential is<br>going<br>unrealized whose lives may have veered<br>off track and who we all were better<br>for I'm thinking for example of the<br>growing numbers of young people not<br>attending school regularly with School<br>attendance at record<br>lows young people entering adult life<br>without basic competency in Reading<br>Writing and<br>maths I'm thinking about the children<br>that bounce from shattered home lives to<br>State care and too often into gangs and<br>eventually the criminal justice<br>system I am thinking about those who<br>start on a youth benefit and who<br>according to the latest official<br>analysis can be expected to spend on<br>average 24 years of their working life<br>on an unemployment<br>benefit successive governments have<br>invested heavily to try and turn these<br>lives around good intentions have<br>abounded but results have been<br>patchy we can do better and we must and<br>that's why I am passionate about social<br>investment for me social investment is<br>about using data evidence and modern<br>analytics to invest in earlier and<br>better intervention that can effectively<br>break cycles of disadvantage dependence<br>and dis spare it's about moving beyond<br>good<br>intentions towards hard evidence about<br>what<br>works improving these people's lives is<br>not only a sign of a decent country it<br>is a recipe for safer communities and a<br>stronger<br>economy but to invest better we need to<br>get much more systematic about what we<br>invest in and how we measure our results<br>and impact in my social Investment<br>Portfolio I will be leading work to<br>ensure all government investment<br>decisions can be informed by better data<br>evidence and impact<br>analysis that means being prepared to<br>stop well-intentioned programs that<br>aren't working so we can power up the<br>work that does it means putting power in<br>the hands of communities where<br>government agencies have too often<br>failed and it means being hardheaded<br>about getting people off welfare and<br>into work and getting kids to<br>school and I share all of this today at<br>this economics Forum because I see too<br>much untapped human potential in New<br>Zealand the past six years have<br>conclusively proven that spending more<br>talking about wellbeing and setting out<br>good intentions are simply not enough to<br>shift the dial<br>a more rigorous approach is needed and<br>our government will deliver<br>it so in closing let me reiterate my<br>view that the year ahead for New Zealand<br>the New Zealand economy May well be a<br>slow grind it will take some time to<br>banish inflation and to welcome back<br>lower interest rates and stronger growth<br>but with better policy choices we can<br>build a much stronger economy in the<br>years to come New Zealand ERS have<br>elected a government with a clear<br>mandate to bring discipline to public<br>spending and to change the growth<br>trajectory for our economy we're excited<br>about the opportunity and I look forward<br>with working to working with all of you<br>to welcome in a bolder more ambitious<br>you<br>thank you Nicola and uh we do have time<br>for a little bit of Q&amp;A before Nicola<br>needs to get on a flight uh but we won't<br>have too long so first there have been<br>some questions that have come through<br>over the app um some of the bigger<br>themes have been around how do you<br>balance those challenges you talked<br>about with your aspirations so<br>particularly around funding<br>infrastructures come up what do you how<br>do you possibly fund that and what's the<br>role for international capital<br>potentially a different look at our<br>levels of debt yeah well look great<br>question uh there's no question that New<br>Zealand is facing an infrastructure<br>deficit uh and it's our government's<br>view that investing in better<br>infrastructure uh is one of the<br>platforms needed to support growth and<br>productivity there's a couple of bits to<br>that first point that I would make is<br>it's not just about finding the dollars<br>it's actually about delivering the<br>projects we commit to uh and on assuming<br>office we have found a number of<br>infrastructure projects and train that<br>have been poorly planned uh and that put<br>significant delivery uh risk on<br>themselves so there's a very big piece<br>of work that we are doing to streamline<br>that infrastructure Pipeline and get<br>better uh at the business of delivery on<br>the funding and finance side uh it is<br>absolutely crucial that we enter<br>2024 with the modern funding and<br>financing tools that advanced econ<br>economies around the world have been<br>using for many years that means public<br>private Partnerships it means public<br>private e Partnerships it means being<br>prepared to use new Revenue tools uh it<br>means being prepared to have private<br>sector Finance into public projects we<br>are open to all of that thinking because<br>we are realistic about the fact that New<br>Zealand will not solve its<br>infrastructure uh deficit with public<br>Capital<br>alone another theme and it's it's<br>connected has been around long-term<br>planning and what I guess governance<br>infrastructure you might put around that<br>many of the challenges we Face span<br>across election Cycles we have short<br>election Cycles we can have big swings<br>what are you doing to plan out for the<br>2030 40 50-year Horizons that we're<br>going to need to solve obviously<br>infrastructure but also some other areas<br>yeah I think obviously as we look to the<br>future with the major challenge of<br>climate change mitigation and adaptation<br>uh with the challenges of demography and<br>with our Ambitions for growth uh we do<br>need to take a intergenerational<br>approach to the planning of<br>infrastructure delivery uh we committed<br>uh as a uh National Party coming into<br>the election uh to getting a 30-year<br>infrastructure pipeline up and running<br>and transparent uh for all on assuming<br>office we found that what we already<br>knew was a bit of a jigsaw puzzle of<br>different crown infrastructure agencies<br>is as messy from the inside as it looks<br>from the outside and so we are<br>undertaking work to better align the<br>work the government does uh to invest in<br>infrastructure across all its functions<br>Education Health transport uh at the<br>moment those different infrastructure<br>pipelines are non-aligned and we are<br>missing massive opportunities uh to<br>create pipelines of investment and<br>efficiency uh so we we are going to pull<br>all of that work together into one<br>Pipeline with both a 5 10 and 30e<br>Horizon uh and Minister Chris Bishop is<br>hard at work on that we've heard the<br>Cries From the private sector from E<br>from communities who say to us the more<br>certainty you give us about the pipeline<br>the more we are able to prepare and<br>invest in those projects and we are<br>going to do the job of turning the state<br>around so that it can actually provide<br>that Clarity and<br>certainty thank you and last question<br>before Nichol is going to have to leave<br>an interesting one what are the<br>coalition's plans to develop the tech<br>sector I've mentioned earlier a fin Tech<br>degree we're launching here in a couple<br>of weeks<br>but we have an enormously productive<br>primary sector we have other sectors but<br>this this area of weightless exports<br>what are you going to do to develop that<br>yeah well look congratulations on the<br>fintech initiative I see huge potential<br>for fintech and I think very exciting<br>for new Zealand you know the tech sector<br>is now the second biggest uh sector uh<br>from an export perspective for New<br>Zealand and even when we talk about our<br>primary Industries increasingly the<br>value that we see being added there is<br>being added through Tech uh so Tech is<br>unquestionably our future uh and we have<br>uh in Minister Judith Collins someone<br>who is very keen to listen to the sector<br>about what they need from government and<br>the message that we are hearing is that<br>what that sector wants from government<br>is not big subsidies uh but is instead a<br>much better regulatory environment uh we<br>have been quite sclerotic across a<br>number of Industries and adapting our<br>regulations to allow for new Innovations<br>and new growth and when we do that it<br>can make a profound difference um he's<br>going to think I'm a greaser but the<br>great example is what uh the last<br>national government did with the space<br>industry to change that regulatory<br>framework to make it easier for Rocket<br>lab uh and now success of others to have<br>a space industry here that works that<br>took concerted effort it wasn't actually<br>about dollars it was about better<br>regulation and we think that that<br>mindset applies actually across a lot of<br>tech areas uh and is one that we need to<br>take we also think that International<br>connections and International Investment<br>and capital are going to be critical to<br>Growing some of our Tech sectors<br>emerging Industries emerging firms do<br>often need Capital we have international<br>Partners who want to provide us that<br>Capital so we want to be a government<br>that brings those two things together<br>thank you look that's all we've got time<br>for um as you can imagine noola has much<br>to do uh so she will get on her way but<br>uh can you please put your hands<br>thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
