subject near and dear to<br>my heart and to many of you here we're<br>shifting gears now and going into the<br>panel called health check what is the<br>prescription for a healthier New Zealand<br>we have uh fantastic panelists here Dez<br>Gorman Joe Lane and Cecilia Robinson<br>coming at this angle from very different<br>views uh this will be uh uh hopefully an<br>informative conversation again lots of<br>questions are coming through on the slid<br>um keep those coming I'll receive them<br>through the iPad and we'll get into it<br>and we will start with you Dez what's<br>your take this is obviously a a<br>challenging area one amongst many uh<br>situation sorry de that sounds like we<br>might have a sound issue can I just get<br>something<br>looks like you might a microphone<br>malfunction thank thank you uh I I'll<br>started going K Toano um I hope you<br>don't mind Matt but I was going to uh<br>spin my introductory comments on some<br>observations about the state of the<br>health state in New Zealand and in the<br>hope that when we get to the the open<br>part of this this this session we can<br>focus largely on Solutions<br>and what needs to be done rather than<br>Rel litigating these problems so forgive<br>me if I have a a focus on what the<br>current situation is and what I think<br>the problems are the first observation<br>I'd make for you is that um New Zealand<br>actually doesn't have a health system we<br>have a disease and injury management<br>system and it's funded annually on the<br>basis of activity so any disease and<br>injury management system which is funded<br>against volumes of activity on an annual<br>basis inevitably directs political<br>attention and funding to hospitals and<br>end of life care and for decades we've<br>talked about the need to shift the point<br>of care out of hospitals into the<br>community and into people's homes and<br>we've also talked about the need to<br>shift the locus of responsibility for<br>health from providers like me to the<br>citizenship but a activity based<br>annualized disease and injury management<br>system almost precludes those sorts of<br>Transformations and in fact is almost<br>inevitably establishes what we have<br>which is a hospital Centric system the<br>second observation I would make as a<br>preface is that it's becoming<br>increasingly difficult for our Public<br>Health Care Providers to live within<br>their means and they are struggling to<br>live within their budgets and you've<br>seen in recent years governments having<br>to produce the metaphorical second<br>checkbook to write the debt off and in<br>part that's because of the annualized<br>approach but it's largely due to the<br>shift in demographics where we now have<br>a relatively large community of older<br>people who consume a lot of health care<br>but don't pay a lot of<br>tax and this is the reason of course why<br>inlightened countries like Switzerland<br>uh France the Netherlands have shifted<br>to social Insurance schemes for their<br>health Germany of course has had a<br>social insurance scheme underpinning its<br>Health System since 1883 the bismar<br>system which was introduced on the basis<br>of the moral principle of solidarity<br>Korea's had an insurance-based Health<br>System since the Korean War and<br>Singapore is a very complex social<br>insurance scheme which includes Health<br>now I'm not arguing that these Insurance<br>schemes uh perfect or they don't have<br>difficulties they do but the huge<br>Advantage they have over our system is<br>that they move from act from funding of<br>activity to moveing to funding on a<br>fully forward funded basis so they tend<br>to actually accumulate funds with time<br>as compared to a pay as you go system as<br>we have the other huge advantage of the<br>social insurance schemes is that you're<br>far more likely to invest in long-term<br>return turn you're a lot more likely to<br>invest in lot in conditions where the<br>benefits to the individual and Society<br>are realized over subsequent years as<br>compared to within the year you're in uh<br>the third observation I'd make Matt<br>would be that uh our health system is<br>inherently ine<br>equitus and there are all sorts of<br>factors which contribute to that<br>inequity and I'll just mentioned two of<br>them uh one of them is that since 1938<br>our Hospital<br>have worked on a concept of universalism<br>and when you have a Universal Health<br>Care System there are two elements the<br>first is who is entitled and the second<br>is what are they entitled to receive now<br>we've always solved the first one that's<br>easy all the citizens and permanent<br>residents of New Zealand are entitled<br>but we've never defined what they're<br>entitled to receive so what we have is a<br>situation of uncapped demand and a<br>finite resource which makes rationing<br>inevitable but that rationing has never<br>been conducted in a transparent way and<br>instead the rationing has largely be<br>controlled by politically powerful<br>Aggregates usually led by providers but<br>often with strong community support and<br>these political economies have been very<br>successful in protecting the in their<br>own interests for example when Health<br>spend relative to GDP is going down they<br>have managed to ring fence their funding<br>when Health spend relative to GDP is<br>going up they've captured most of the<br>new money and it's been then marketed to<br>the community as greater access greater<br>volumes which of course the community<br>experiences has reduced waiting times<br>but what this means this system means<br>that the well-funded areas continue to<br>be well funded and the areas which are<br>not well funded continue to be poorly<br>funded for example mental health mental<br>health also clearly suffers because it<br>is least suited to an annualized<br>activity type of budget so how new<br>zealanders experience their health care<br>depends upon who they are where they are<br>and what they need or or<br>want and the final observation I'd make<br>is that if we're looking at the<br>existential risks to healthc care in New<br>Zealand I'd list them this way I'd say<br>it's Workforce Workforce and<br>Workforce uh we have a Workforce crisis<br>and yes we need to recruit from offshore<br>and I'm very pleased to see that recent<br>Visa changes have taken the AG in<br>residential care sector from an<br>undersupplied labor market to an<br>oversupplied labor market and yes we<br>need to train more but training more and<br>recruiting both have significant<br>lags and so our attention has to be on<br>retaining the workforce we have and not<br>only retaining them but extending their<br>roles and fun functions and the<br>commitment that they make so look so<br>there's a series of observations mat<br>about our current situation and I think<br>the most important of those for you is<br>that it's important for new zealanders<br>to realize we do not have a health<br>system and our health our injury and<br>disease management system does not<br>behave like a service industry thanks<br>man de thank you uh quite a lot on that<br>and I suspect a lot of those themes will<br>weave through the next discussion I'm<br>going to pass to you Joe next um the<br>last point on health Force I imagine is<br>one you may pick up but I'll hand to you<br>brilliant Kato um so if New Zealand<br>wants to be healthier uh we simply have<br>to have a health Workforce that is<br>healthier too um health is one of the<br>largest employers in the country one in<br>nine employees is employed in the health<br>sector and so to reiterate de's point<br>we're really not going to fix some of<br>the issues that we have in our health<br>sector until we address uh Workforce um<br>there are chronic Workforce shortages in<br>effectively all of our Health<br>Professions and different Specialties<br>and if someone tries to tell you that<br>this is due to the pandemic um they're<br>either kidding themselves or they're<br>lying to you because we've known about<br>these problems for decades you know look<br>back to the reports from the early 2000s<br>that talk about our aging and growing<br>population and the need to invest into<br>further Health Workforce uh development<br>so what is the prescription to a healthy<br>in New Zealand I would say it is<br>significantly increasing the number of<br>students that we are training locally in<br>our respective Health uh professions<br>that's the only sustainable long-term<br>solution that is going to deliver the<br>cultural uh safety and the clinical<br>safety that we expect here in Alo uh to<br>pick up from Minister Willis's comments<br>earlier to try and address that we<br>really need to take a systems based<br>approach to look at where the problems<br>are because those challenges are<br>different in the different<br>professions um for example if you were<br>to look at medicine um our fundamental<br>problem is that we are training too few<br>doctors there just literally are not<br>enough places we've artificially<br>constrained the supply going through our<br>system and if we Benchmark ourselves<br>across to the oecd we find we're right<br>towards the bottom of the pack if we<br>compare ourselves to Australia on a per<br>capita basis we've got 40% fewer medical<br>training places so there's simply not<br>enough doctors going through the system<br>and our model of Education that we are<br>using is also not delivering the health<br>work out Workforce outcomes that we're<br>looking for uh po simply too few are<br>choosing Primary Care Specialties or<br>choosing to work in our regional<br>communities compare this to something<br>like Pharmacy though uh and we actually<br>have two few students choosing to start<br>Pharmacy uh we've had declining<br>enrollments into those programs the<br>existing Bachelor of Pharmacy programs<br>just aren't meeting the needs of<br>Learners coming into that space and if<br>you were to compare again to something<br>like Midwifery the fundamental problem<br>is about degree completion rates where<br>they uh hover just over<br>50% uh we need to acknowledge if we're<br>going to try to address some of those<br>things uh that we can't just do more of<br>the same more of the same is not the<br>solution uh to these problems and we<br>need to start thinking about more modern<br>solutions more modern curricular and<br>programs uh to uh suit Learners over the<br>past 20 or so years Learners have<br>changed and by and large our curricular<br>have not nor have our universities we<br>still expect students to turn up under<br>the same sort of structure and model and<br>of course people are having multiple<br>careers in their lifetime they're<br>wanting to be able to change and<br>transition to different careers and yet<br>we're still uh structured around uh go<br>to university be there full-time for<br>four years or something to<br>train um we we also need to think about<br>the barriers that are preventing<br>students from enrolling into different<br>programs and to completing them um and I<br>would suggest that with New Zealand's<br>interest free student loan scheme which<br>is effectively a deferred tax user pays<br>deferred tax um we don't have upfront<br>Financial barriers stopping people<br>getting into uh Health retraining or<br>training um but the problem is cost of<br>living while they go through those<br>training processes and so if we want<br>targeted uh investment to really deliver<br>a Health Workforce uh to fit the<br>population needs we need to start<br>thinking about how we're supporting<br>Learners financially through their<br>studies uh to be clear I'm not talking<br>about going back to an earn as you learn<br>type model that gets bandied around a<br>little bit uh but to think about some<br>sort of paid to learn model some sort of<br>universal student allowance that's at a<br>higher rate for priority areas uh to<br>really encourage people into those<br>professions and to allow them to<br>successfully complete their training and<br>take up their position in our Workforce<br>so I'll leave it there m Joe thank you a<br>lot there too all right across to you<br>cilia you're obviously approaching this<br>from quite a different perspective again<br>via tent so over to you um k um course<br>cilia Robinson<br>tooa um my name is Cecilia Robinson and<br>I'm the founder and co- CEO at tnd<br>healthare uh we're one of the largest<br>Primary Healthcare Providers in New<br>Zealand nowadays we represent about<br>130,000 kiwis across our group um and we<br>were founded about 3 years ago and<br>what's really interesting to me about<br>Primary Healthcare coming into the<br>sector is all of the issues that have<br>just so clearly been outlined and that<br>we lack a really fundamental part of our<br>system functioning really well um and<br>that's technology you know our health<br>system has been built of maybe 12<br>dispirit systems that don't work to<br>either favor the bureaucrats the<br>consumer um or the clinicians themselves<br>right and so tend has been founded<br>around the idea that if we could start a<br>fresh with a fresh Primary Healthcare<br>System we would start with a phenomenal<br>technology platform and then would<br>integrate that into our operational<br>clinics and into our day-to-day delivery<br>so I want to be clear we're not a<br>software as a service company we are a<br>primary healthare provider that is<br>powered by an amazing technology um and<br>this is how developing countries are<br>actually able to Leap Frog us as New<br>Zealand and how they're delivering<br>Primary Healthcare because they're<br>starting with amazing technology and<br>from that Foundation they're delivering<br>services and that's what we're doing at<br>tend and you know we started with a<br>thesis when we were initially exploring<br>the concept for tend about 5 years ago<br>and that thesis was around could we make<br>our Workforce more productive could we<br>change the way that they work could we<br>have the right people doing the right<br>things in the right way at the right<br>time um and that thesis is coming true<br>and so I'm coming at the health um from<br>the health side feeling positive today<br>at T we're able to demonstrate that we<br>can change the way that we're delivering<br>services and who is delivering that<br>service to that consumer at that point<br>in time and so I'm really excited about<br>the conversation today and listening to<br>some of the challenges and also sharing<br>with you some of the achievements that<br>we've had along the way Equity is a<br>massive big part of tend and some of our<br>the things that we're most proud of has<br>been seeing a significant enrollment um<br>in Mai across Oakland about 20% higher<br>than the average and similar with our um<br>Mii with our tomik Mari um immunizations<br>again about 20% higher than the average<br>for Oakland and our most recent Clinic<br>that we've reopened for services um<br>postd doing integration we've seen a 70%<br>uptake in Pacifica enrollment a 30%<br>uptick in Mai enrollments and Asian<br>enrollments as well and so what we're<br>demonstrating is that you can make a<br>health system that is more Equitable<br>that improves productivity and that's<br>able to deliver more for everyone that's<br>involved in our system so while we've<br>got a lot of challenges and we're facing<br>those challenges every single day<br>there's also hope that for having<br>appropriate technology operationalized<br>through clinics you can deliver a better<br>healthcare<br>system thank you Cecilia I'm actually<br>going to stay with you although others<br>might comment on this is question come<br>through<br>here uh what are the opportunities for<br>earlier earlier intervention in in a<br>health Journey that can potentially uh<br>you know save costs over the long term<br>how do we get how do we get to people<br>before things spiral out of control can<br>you touch on that another yeah look I'm<br>really excited to share I mean we've put<br>a number of initiatives in place um<br>across our Workforce and across our<br>practices to be able to deliver a better<br>customer experience one of them is our<br>online na service which is the ability<br>to be able to see a doctor uh reasonably<br>quickly and by reasonably quickly I mean<br>often within a couple of hours you're<br>able to see one of our GPS online or you<br>can book an appointment in our clinic<br>and what we're seeing is that we're<br>preventing admission to emergency rooms<br>for actually being able to see patients<br>before they need to present to emergency<br>rooms and so this is really important I<br>think one of the things that does not<br>get talked enough about in this country<br>is that we've got about a half a million<br>or 470,000 people who are not enrolled<br>within a Primary Healthcare practice and<br>the problem for all of us is that these<br>people are also presenting to emergency<br>rooms when they have Primary Healthcare<br>related issues and so about 70% of<br>people who present to EDS should have<br>been prevented through Primary<br>Healthcare it's a dysfunctional system<br>right and the incentives are not right<br>but what we're seeing and what we're<br>Bing being able to demonstrate is that<br>if we can intervene earlier we can<br>prevent that presentation and so we're<br>doing that live that's happening daily<br>and we're measuring that and it's<br>something that we're going to begin<br>talking more about as we go through um<br>this year as well so you can have a big<br>impact and that is about how you<br>productize how you improve productivity<br>across your<br>Workforce and identifying the right<br>person dealing with the right complaint<br>at the right time and the right way and<br>that is something we've been hamstrung<br>by for a long time is that the GP is is<br>kind of you know um the center of<br>everything and we have to change that<br>interesting I'm actually going to LEAP<br>from there but stay on the topic of<br>general practice so de youve written a<br>paper recently with maray horn about<br>General Practitioners GPS I picked up<br>the stat there which which caught me and<br>hopefully I've got this right if we were<br>to maintain the ratio of GPS to<br>population I think<br>50% of our Medical gradu school<br>graduates would need to be coming out<br>and choosing to go into general practice<br>but I believe only 10% actually intends<br>to can you when we hear what you're just<br>talking about cilia about getting to<br>people at the top of the cliff it sounds<br>like that problem not withstanding you<br>know technological uh you know changes<br>that can help how do we address that<br>yeah it's a very good question the first<br>observation I'd make is something<br>Cecilia was talking about which was the<br>large number of people are not enrolled<br>uh with a general practice and I think<br>we've got to understand that for most<br>new zealanders they regard Health Care<br>like insurance they just assume it'll be<br>there when they need it and they don't<br>necessarily see it as being their<br>obligation to maintain their health and<br>well-being so to shift that locus of<br>responsibility is going to require a<br>culture change and I think one of the<br>meaningful steps towards that culture<br>change is something that's happening now<br>where to say a people are managing their<br>own budgets and purchasing their health<br>care and that system is working very<br>well and in my opinion individual budget<br>Holdings should be extended to all<br>disabled people with OP with an opt out<br>option and to all people with chronic<br>disease actually again with a op out<br>option as a first meaningful step in<br>Shifting the locus of responsibility<br>from me as a provider to the citizenship<br>so I think the problem with getting<br>Upstream is that the average New Zealand<br>does not see Health as their primary<br>responsibility they've abated that<br>responsibility to the clever people who<br>will look after them when the time comes<br>in terms of uh our general practice<br>Workforce uh I I see the future as we<br>need to keep this walker afloat and then<br>we need to find a way of getting the<br>Walker to a ara and in terms of keeping<br>it afloat the existential risk is uh in<br>our Workforce uh the recent Commonwealth<br>review suggested that 40% of our GPS<br>intend to retire in the next year or so<br>uh when we did a big survey of our<br>nursing Workforce a quarter to a half of<br>them said they were either going to<br>reduce their RS or stop working all<br>together as soon as they could afford it<br>so our real issue is how do we retain<br>the workforce in place and increase the<br>things that they do in terms of of our<br>output from our medical schools and I'm<br>ashamed to put my hand up and say that I<br>was the head of the school of medicine<br>at the University of Oakland and we<br>continued to chune out graduates who had<br>a strong affection for hospital-based<br>specialities which is hardly surprising<br>we trained them in teaching hospitals so<br>that's where their role models sat the<br>data you quote Matt's accurate and in<br>fact we're going to have to for the next<br>decade to stand still in terms of GP to<br>community ratios we're going to have to<br>recruit 200 overseas doctors every year<br>who will go into general practice just<br>to stand still and unfortunately I I<br>think that's a pipe dream and so<br>reimagining general practice and in<br>particular changing the business models<br>in general practice isn't a matter of<br>fiddling with the systems in place but<br>it requires a complete recast and it is<br>possible to do it and if you don't mind<br>metal very quick story uh when Mari horn<br>and I were doing the review of the<br>health system in Queensland we became<br>aware of a area in Brisbane where they<br>had Hospital Ed overruns and in fact the<br>the hospitals couldn't cope they had<br>that ambulances ramped uh down down the<br>ramp and around the<br>corner and so they went to the local<br>general practice communities and said<br>what would we need to do to encourage<br>you to do more after hour care Critical<br>Care Emergency Care in the community and<br>that conversation went on for a while<br>because the immediate response was give<br>us more money and they said well if that<br>was the pro that was a solution we would<br>have fixed this a long time ago and what<br>they ended up eventually deciding on is<br>a system where if the GPS agreed to<br>audit and if the GPS agreed to do more<br>after hours care and critical care in<br>the community they could call themselves<br>a platinum practice and if they became a<br>platinum practice they could order MRI<br>scans and CT pet scans and<br>investigations which currently are<br>denied to General Practitioners and<br>instead of sending their patient to the<br>hospital to be in on Outpatient Clinic<br>they could place them directly on an<br>operating list and so that system worked<br>wonderfully well there was a huge uplift<br>and activity in that general practice<br>Community the uh over tasking of the Ed<br>ceased and when I went asked the GPS<br>what was it that got you to this happy<br>place it wasn't money it was the fact<br>that they were taken seriously it was<br>the fact that their status had been<br>enhanced and that status had been<br>enhanced by way of<br>privilege so there are ways in which we<br>can keep this walker afloat but it<br>requires as I say a complete reimagining<br>of primary care where we take the word<br>primary and we don't see GPS as triage<br>for Specialists like me but we see GPS<br>in the primary sense as being the key<br>and the core of our health system and<br>people like me are partials and our job<br>is to assist the GPS to manage the<br>health care of their their patients but<br>that story shows you how you can take a<br>current underserviced area and change it<br>by addressing predominantly status and<br>privilege thank you de right a lot of<br>questions coming through here I'm going<br>to go to One For You Joe so there's<br>Workforce is critical um the team here<br>from Scots College welcome it's good to<br>see some people with the the future<br>Generations in the room too um have<br>asked a bit about incentives to retain<br>but before we get to that can you just<br>give a snapshot of what you're trying to<br>do around medical schools or maybe a<br>contrast between the New Zealand system<br>of training medical professionals and<br>some of the innovations that have been<br>happening in other places yeah<br>absolutely so New Zealand currently has<br>two medical schools one at the<br>University of Orland one at the<br>University of Oto um and they deliver<br>one model of medical education it's a<br>standard uh traditional six-year<br>undergraduate program students are<br>selected in after a competitive first<br>year Health Science Program into the<br>second year that's where our real<br>restriction is put in place and then<br>once students make it to that point they<br>effectively all graduate complete go out<br>into Workforce um as Dez alluded to<br>though the selection process that goes<br>into that model and also the training<br>model where the vast majority of the<br>clinical training happens in tertiary<br>hospitals means that students are far<br>more likely to choose a specialty that's<br>delivered in a tertiary Hospital from<br>familiarity apart from anything else uh<br>compared to general practice so uh on<br>average about one in six graduates that<br>are going to come out of our existing<br>medical schools that style of medical<br>education will choose uh general<br>practice if we contrast that uh to other<br>models that we can see globally uh the<br>dominant model of medical education in<br>Australia is now what's known as<br>graduate entry medicine so students<br>complete an existing bachelor's degree<br>in a wide range of different subjects<br>they're selected into the program at a<br>different stage of Life a point at which<br>uh they probably really know who they<br>are as an individual and what they want<br>to do distinct from what Mom and Dad<br>might have wanted them to do when they<br>were 17 and at High School uh and so<br>you've got a bit more information to be<br>able to be a bit more targeted around<br>what what what sort of future pathway<br>does this person want to have and and<br>try to prioritize students that are more<br>likely to choose a general practice or<br>Primary Care specialty so if we compare<br>to one of those four-year graduate entry<br>uh programs uh across Australia we see<br>uh rates of about 40 50 even 60% of<br>graduates choosing to go into Primary<br>Care at the other end of it so when we<br>think about targeted investment into our<br>biggest challenges and our biggest<br>problems it really doesn't make a lot of<br>sense to increase the size of programs<br>where one and six are going into your<br>biggest need compared to standing up a<br>new program where you can hope to get 40<br>50 or 60% of students graduating and<br>going out into that uh particular area<br>of need the other thing that's uh unique<br>about uh the program that we we're<br>proposed here at wo is a really strong<br>focus in our regional and Rural<br>communities so students do what is known<br>as longitudinal placements they spend a<br>whole year in a local Community really<br>getting to know that Community uh really<br>being uh closely embedded in it and<br>there's some really successful models of<br>how that works and operates in Australia<br>that we'd like to uh translate into the<br>New Zealand context U make it fit for<br>purpose for us here uh and really<br>deliver the health Workforce needs that<br>we<br>have thanks CH I<br>um I'll step off Workforce although it's<br>all connected and pass across to you<br>cilia there's another question here how<br>do public and private sector<br>collaboration work to deliver some of<br>the needs we meet whether that be in<br>Workforce or in technology or in funding<br>models how do you think about public<br>private sector collaboration yeah look I<br>mean I think I feel positive about it<br>now um I think that there is a positive<br>shift towards welcoming business to come<br>up with Solutions and actually help<br>support and identify the issues that um<br>we're seeing in Primary Healthcare uh<br>and look we are a private Endeavor<br>that's um you know partially publicly<br>funded uh for capitation funding uh but<br>I think that that's what we need more<br>models of we need the public sector to<br>come closer towards the private sector<br>and actually have those conversations<br>and look at the innovations that are<br>happening and that's cross a range of<br>Industries right ours is just one<br>example um but you know for us and going<br>back to something um that the said about<br>the unenrolled population we need to be<br>thinking differently to be resolving the<br>problems that we're seeing you know<br>we're seeing the unenrolled population<br>there half a million people who are<br>presenting to ads and are taking up<br>spots for all of us when we actually<br>need to go because something bad has<br>happened you know we see fairly<br>straightforward solutions to those<br>issues such as being able to enroll<br>patients in remote communities where<br>they can't access healthare and actually<br>provide continuity of care through to<br>them through other Health Care<br>Professionals like nurses Nurse<br>Practitioners uh physios um prescribing<br>pharmacists pharmacist is a range of<br>people in your communities that can<br>actually provide you with services and<br>currently we're not able to connect the<br>dots on all of the healthcare workers<br>and GPS kind of remain uh the center of<br>it and so that's a model we need to move<br>away from but if we're going to move<br>away from that model we're going to need<br>that real partnership and place between<br>the private sector and the public sector<br>to make those things and those<br>Innovations happen right thank you<br>D look I think we need to address one of<br>the great misconceptions which exist I<br>mentioned one before that we have a<br>health system when we don't the other is<br>that our health system is publicly<br>provided well it actually isn't in 1938<br>Michael Joseph Savage tried to introduce<br>a universal Public Health Care System<br>but the New Zealand chapter of the<br>British Medical Association the GPS<br>opposed him and rolled him you imagine<br>that the political economy of that group<br>the political Capital that Savage must<br>have had after the Great Depression but<br>he was rolled in terms of uh Primary<br>Care most of our health care is<br>delivered by private providers the GPS<br>are private the retail pharmacists are<br>private the dentists are private the<br>physiotherapist the they're all<br>privately employed we have a largly<br>publicly funded but privately delivered<br>Health Care system and I keep having<br>people having saying to me AAS the sorts<br>of things you're recommending are<br>privatization by stealth that's a<br>nonsense it already is privatized and<br>we've got to move to a values system for<br>our health system we should purchase<br>health care from the provider who can<br>give us the best outcome at the lowest<br>cost totally that's the definition from<br>Michael Porter who's the value Guru from<br>Harvard now if the person that can<br>provide us with the best outcomes at the<br>lowest cost happens to be publicly<br>employed so be it or privately employed<br>but not for profit so be it or privately<br>employed for profit so be it we should<br>be agnostic about the type of employment<br>the provider has and focus on the value<br>proposition and this is moving to the<br>idea of tight loose tight Health<br>purchasing or commissioning where you're<br>very tight about the outcomes you want<br>for example the outcome from hip<br>operations is mobility being a to get<br>the Recreations back getting back to<br>work the outcomes you want from cataract<br>surgeries they get some get their<br>license back and regain their<br>independence you have to be tight about<br>the outcome you want you have to be<br>tight about how you measure it and what<br>the consequences of it not being<br>achieved but absolutely agnostic about<br>how it's done and who does it tight<br>loose tight and that is basing a health<br>system on value and people want to jump<br>up and down and say hey that private<br>provider is making a profit I'm going to<br>say to them they're providing us with a<br>better outcome at a lower cost which of<br>those two bits don't you<br>like but I think it's an absolute<br>misconception that we have a publicly<br>delivered Health System we do<br>not thank you de uh put the microphone<br>down too fast we um you touched on it<br>there and there's questions come through<br>as well I want to dive into funding and<br>of course others might have views here<br>can you give a picture this is this is<br>not a health conference it's a general<br>audience can you give a picture of the<br>current F funding model and touch on how<br>we might change that with a particular<br>if you can run us through that concept<br>of social<br>insurance the the the current funding<br>model as I said is based on purchasing<br>from provider groups a certain level of<br>activity per year so they're paid to do<br>outputs not to achieve anything to to do<br>outputs so that's the hospital system<br>it's based on activity the primary care<br>system is based on a capitation largely<br>with some fee for service but tragically<br>the capitation the calculus used in the<br>capitation for GPS was based on the<br>15minute consultation which makes GP<br>specialist Services almost<br>impossible but our system is pay as you<br>go and what pay as you go systems do is<br>they accumulate a deficit for future<br>Generations the social insurance schemes<br>on the other hand have in their basis<br>accumulating enough money so that they<br>can pay for their future<br>liabilities and as I said the great<br>attraction of social insurance is that<br>it encourages investment in conditions<br>where the benefit to the individual and<br>Society is realized across<br>time if you take the Swiss system for<br>example the Swiss government has defined<br>a set of core Services every citizen in<br>Switzerland is entitled to this core of<br>services and then the insurance<br>companies are required to provide an<br>insurance which meets those core<br>services and there's a fixed price for<br>that so how do you and I choose which<br>insurance company to go to they compete<br>for our business on the basis of<br>additional extras like a cancer extra or<br>a trauma EXT extra and so they compete<br>very hard to actually provide us with<br>additional services but it's in their<br>interests to reduce the cost of<br>delivering those core services and this<br>is moving to a fully funded model and if<br>you think it's impossible to move from<br>pay as you go debt based systems to<br>being fully forward funded we've already<br>done that in New Zealand with<br>ACC ACC has gone from being a<br>organization which had incured a debt of<br>all close to $30 billion on behalf of<br>all new zealanders to now something<br>which has enough money in the bank to<br>meet its future liabilities when I was<br>on the board at ACC there were two<br>things we paid attention to one was our<br>uh our consumer uh ratings and the other<br>was outstanding claims liability and we<br>we given a figure like at the moment<br>outstanding claims liability is 101% of<br>the money we got in the bank or whatever<br>so social insurance schemes are a step<br>towards being fully forward funded<br>whereas our current<br>tax-based health care funding only works<br>if you have a relatively large<br>population of young people paying a lot<br>of tax and not consuming a lot of health<br>care and that's no longer our<br>demographic and the health system that<br>modeled itself on us people say we<br>modeled ourself and the National Health<br>Service that's not true they model<br>themselves on us both the National<br>Health Health Service and our Health<br>Service have got to the point where it's<br>almost impossible for public providers<br>to live within their<br>means thank<br>you I'm going to switch tax now uh a lot<br>of interest in a question here about<br>mental health so I was uh driving the<br>kids to school this week and heard media<br>about<br>police talking of stepping back from<br>being front Frontline providers in the<br>case of mental health which I could<br>understand uh a discussion of whether to<br>add mental health as an option on when<br>you dial 111 a number that struck me the<br>police have dealt with<br>77,000 callouts that relate to mental<br>health which they are saying they're<br>grappling with some of the the Law and<br>Order things that they do um you talk<br>about a 15minute<br>visit those models just are not going to<br>work together how do you potentially see<br>this how do you see us resourcing<br>funding managing to deal with mental<br>health particularly when you factor in<br>the notion of a lack of uh homegrown<br>Workforce because mental health is often<br>culturally context specific and it can<br>be very hard to arrive into a different<br>country meet that I'll start this but<br>I'm interested I'll be very quick um<br>mental health is almost the post a child<br>for social investment uh Health<br>inequities are largely socially<br>determined housing education empy<br>employment but if you think about a<br>health system it doesn't actually<br>control education housing or employment<br>so the first thing you realize that most<br>of the factors which determine the<br>well-being of our society are outside<br>the gift of the health system and most<br>of the impact of mental health with all<br>due respect is also outside the health<br>system mental poor mental Health's cheap<br>to the health system but it's expensive<br>to the education system Child Protection<br>Systems the social welfare systems the<br>police service and the prison service so<br>you need a hall of society approach to<br>seriously address the predominant<br>drivers of poor mental health and social<br>investment is the vehicle to drive that<br>in terms of the single biggest step we<br>can take in providing better mental<br>health M the first person people go to<br>see with a mental health problem is<br>their GP the majority of people with a<br>mental health problem first make contact<br>with their family doctor The Simple<br>Solution is to say to the GPS if you're<br>prepared to be upskilled and if you're<br>prepared to be part of a network which<br>includes a couple of psychiatrists will<br>allow you to have extended consultation<br>times for people with mental health<br>problems and will pay you accordingly so<br>you take the community that are already<br>going that are already seeing people<br>first up and instead of a 15 minute<br>which is impossible for the time I say<br>hello how are you sit down then please<br>leave you're irritating me with we have<br>seven or eight minutes of meaningful<br>contact time well I I just have to say I<br>spent an hour with a new patient and I<br>struggle to do it in an hour the idea<br>you do it in 15 minutes is ridiculous so<br>I think if we were going to do one thing<br>in the mental health agenda it's to<br>power up the general practice Community<br>by paying them to do meaningful first<br>contacts with people with mental health<br>but I say it again mental health should<br>be the poster child for the social<br>investment approach<br>thank you and I um will touch on that in<br>our social P social investment panel<br>this afternoon I'm sure Cecilia yeah<br>look I mean I've got a a slightly<br>different view from Dez I mean we're<br>lyed on a lot of the things that he's<br>saying but we're operationalizing a<br>large portion of what di is talking<br>about and you know I've got GPS that are<br>saying a significant burden of mental<br>health patients we've got about 500<br>clinicians at teend or 500 staff attend<br>300 clinicians and you know about a quar<br>to a third of all appointments are<br>mental health related um and actually a<br>significant amount of my GPS have not<br>qualified as psychologists and they<br>don't want to necessarily do that work<br>um if they wanted to be a psychologist<br>that's what they would have qualified as<br>and that's what the community tells us<br>and so how are we resolving that problem<br>uh we're resolving it early for<br>intervention and so what we're doing is<br>first of all we need to understand that<br>there's different types of mental health<br>presentations everything from a student<br>who's really concerned about and has<br>anxiety around an exam that they have to<br>obviously some of the most severe um<br>cases that you can see so there's a<br>really broad SP spectrum of presentation<br>and then what we're doing is that we're<br>looking at the individual cases and<br>endeavoring to assign them to the right<br>person to see them in the right way at<br>the right time and by that I mean a<br>health Improvement practitioner a health<br>coach it might be someone that's a nurse<br>a mental health nurse it might be a GP<br>who wants to be paid more and is<br>interested in mental health right but<br>unfortunately it's not a one- siiz fits<br>all approach and so we need to be better<br>aligning at to who the person is what<br>they're presenting with and whoever is<br>best to deliver that service but what<br>I'm really clear on is that we cannot<br>fragment mental health away from primary<br>practice it actually has to be delivered<br>together and that what we're seeing at a<br>global level is that these kind of popup<br>Mental Health Services that are<br>fragmented from your wider Primary<br>Health Care are occurring and we believe<br>that actually your mental health<br>alongside any other health issues that<br>you have presenting needs to be resolved<br>by Primary Care um and we can do that by<br>delivering it by different people in<br>different ways at a different cost both<br>to the system and to that person um and<br>again we're having really good success<br>seeing this right and we're also<br>intervening at an early stage if we're<br>seeing a patient that's presenting with<br>complex mental health issues you know<br>our team is pre intervening with that<br>patient saying look before you present<br>to a GP you need a half an hour<br>appointment and if you're not prepared<br>to pay that then it might be better that<br>you say the mental health nurse or a<br>health Improvement practitioner<br>unfortunately the budget held for some<br>of the key roles for Primary Healthcare<br>is actually held by phos and and<br>clipping the ticket along the way on the<br>services that we're delivering and so we<br>could utilize more people across the<br>space who are not JPS uh but<br>unfortunately it's very difficult for us<br>right<br>now thank you Joe you take yeah I mean I<br>would say you know there's a phrase that<br>there's no Health without mental health<br>and at times we seem to try to create<br>mental health as its own thing to deal<br>with and we miss the fact that it's<br>actually an integrated part of who<br>somebody is uh and so thinking about<br>Workforce and thinking about you know<br>well what is what a modern curricula<br>what a modern programs look like how are<br>we equipping our GP our nurses our<br>physios Our Midwives um this is not a<br>one-sized fits-all kind of um approach<br>so you know a lot of what we've been<br>developing here at the University of wo<br>it's a it's a really integrated approach<br>to mental and phys physical health not<br>trying to treat them as two totally<br>disperate or or separate um activities<br>which I think you know it's the it's the<br>key to trying to address it there's also<br>the issue around scope which I think<br>Cecilia touched on a little bit in the<br>sense that we've got<br>psychologists we just lost you got no<br>batteries on back in um we've got GPS we<br>have psychiatrists we we have different<br>people who have different roles um but<br>those Scopes are quite well<br>defined we're on the we're on the link<br>um those Scopes are quite well defined<br>and the question is thinking going<br>forward um are those boundaries<br>appropriate you know those scopes of<br>practice were set some time ago should<br>we be looking at some form of clinical<br>psychologist who does have prescribing<br>rights in a limited sense a little bit<br>like a designated nurse prescriber or a<br>nurse practitioner can prescribe some<br>medications but not others so starting<br>to think about triaging and some of the<br>more common uh more clearly defined<br>mental health uh challenges that people<br>might be facing<br>thinking about what's the most<br>appropriate scope of practice to be able<br>to deal and manage with that<br>situation I was going to say I mean we<br>saw a significant amount of funds<br>supposedly go into mental health but as<br>a primary healthcare provider we saw<br>none of it right and there was a<br>significant amount and this is going<br>back to des's point around outcome based<br>funding you know intervention doesn't<br>mean outcome and I think we need to<br>understand that as a population you know<br>there's um a report around how some of<br>that funding was spent and basically<br>cost us as taxpayers 300 bucks to see<br>one patient um as an intervention but we<br>don't know what the outcome is of those<br>patients so we need to be a lot more<br>targeted around how funding is allocated<br>and who it's allocated<br>to can I ask we're going to have a<br>discussion at this room after lunch<br>about demographics um it's been touched<br>on already can I ask and maybe go to you<br>on this one<br>D what changes for better or worse<br>demographics in the next 10 20 years and<br>I'm interested in that the Aging<br>population definitely but also the<br>diversity of our population and how when<br>we're thinking about Equity of access<br>people again a very good question you're<br>right most attention has been paid to uh<br>our relative<br>aging and the impact that has because<br>most people consume majority of their<br>healthare just before they die it used<br>to be in the last year of your life but<br>my profession's become so good at<br>keeping you alive there now the last 10<br>years of your life the penalties of<br>success uh well it's a perverse success<br>but you're not dying of some you're not<br>dying young of some infectious disease<br>you're not dying young of heart disease<br>you're not dying younger from some form<br>of simple cancer you're now living old<br>enough so that the rate of dementia for<br>example is increasing by 4% cumulative<br>perom so the problem that we've got<br>we've created and we've created by<br>maintaining people well past if you like<br>the biological used by dates I see some<br>nervous faces in the<br>room the uh uh so the most attention is<br>on uh that demographic shift in terms of<br>the diversity of our community which of<br>course is something we need to celebrate<br>the minute you try to aggregate Health<br>RIS the level of race I think you<br>introduce a whole series of anomalies<br>and<br>uh biases which actually don't lead to<br>good outcomes for example and I think<br>this is a point that b Bill English made<br>that I really liked we don't need to<br>aggregate risk to a community or to a<br>racial group we know the problems the<br>people who live at 9 MOA Street in OT<br>Taho that's the problem we know it's<br>that individual over there we actually<br>Define who our at risk people are and<br>our at risk families are there's no need<br>to aggregate risk we can actually<br>identify the vulnerable individuals we<br>need to wrap<br>services around them almost agnostic of<br>culture or race although having said<br>that clearly the services need to be<br>culturally appropriate and of course the<br>way to ensure that is for the the person<br>that you're wrapping services around to<br>Define what the outcomes are that they<br>want and that's why individual budget<br>Holdings are such a powerful tool<br>because if the person holds the budget<br>and employs their providers then they<br>are absolutely in the driver's seat in<br>terms of determining what the outcomes<br>are and certainly for mental health<br>problems I think individual budget<br>Holdings for chronic mental health uh is<br>a solution to a problem which is overdue<br>but the Aging demographic matter is the<br>one that's got us fixated<br>we may well have a demographic problem<br>of a large number of unemployed younger<br>people uh we are not sure yet what the<br>technological impact will be on<br>employment uh and particularly<br>employment for people who don't have<br>transferable<br>skills uh but again I think the focus in<br>the future has to be on our ability to<br>identify individuals and families in<br>distress and to focus on them thank you<br>we'll pass to you Cecilia maybe come on<br>that and we'll keep we'll keep it<br>relatively brief because I have got one<br>final question for you all before we go<br>to lunch yeah so briefly um I mean I<br>think it's by 2040 one and three<br>children are going to be born Mai so you<br>know it is all of us new zealanders and<br>again what we're demonstrating at tend<br>is that if you have a accessible<br>Healthcare System where a person<br>presenting can pick the type of<br>clinician that they need to see whether<br>that's based on an urgent need to see<br>someone or it's called culturally you<br>want to see someone that's aligned with<br>you from a language perspective you want<br>to speak to someone that speaks your<br>language whether it's a gender whether<br>it's a specialty that's how you overcome<br>some of those access and Equity issues<br>and so we we're feeling really confident<br>that you can overcome that and you don't<br>have a separate system that needs to<br>ensure that you can cater to everybody<br>within the same system as long as you're<br>making it easy for people to access<br>those<br>Services really thank you all right<br>we've got uh six or seven minutes to go<br>and we we can see the screen here<br>uh it's time for you to uh do some<br>imagining so the three of you you're<br>running the ship we heard from the<br>Minister of Finance uh this morning but<br>let's say that you had the power you<br>were you were governing and you had<br>control of the system over the next two<br>three 5 years the next say couple of<br>electoral Cycles um what are your<br>priorities and what do you want to see<br>Heaven I'll start with you Cecilia you<br>got the mic well look I would<br>incentivize the opportunity for private<br>and public although de says it is<br>already private businesses to work<br>alongside government to help provide<br>solutions to the problems that we're<br>facing um I would ensure that we're<br>picking up on the unenrolled population<br>across New Zealand and actually<br>appropriately accessing the services<br>from a public health perspective that<br>they need um and so I think we really<br>need to think long and hard about what a<br>health system looks like rather than an<br>activity based system like this is<br>talking about and how we drive those<br>outcomes from an early stage<br>and so for us it is an investment in<br>technology it is an investment in a<br>broad um group of skill sets and<br>acknowledging that you know we have to<br>have multiple people providing Services<br>um to be able to make Healthcare um both<br>an attractive and um a positive place to<br>be and to be someone who's providing<br>Services um so look that's a challenge<br>to government here is ensuring that<br>you're working really closely with the<br>parties in the industry and that you're<br>coming up with Solutions alongside them<br>not independently from them which is<br>something that we've seen in the<br>Joe where would you want<br>that self<br>all priority would be around some of<br>universal student allowance for student<br>studying priority subjects like M and<br>nursing and others let's get students<br>through and sucessfully<br>through thank you Joe and just a comment<br>on um I know Joe didn't like the term<br>earn as you learn I like it I like it<br>too earn as you learn I think has great<br>attraction particularly in areas like<br>nursing and mid<br>Midwifery uh our loss of students in<br>nursing and Midwifery is completely<br>unacceptable yes particularly for young<br>Mari and Pacifica people studying<br>nursing and Midwifery to lose a third of<br>our students in a in a these programs is<br>completely<br>unacceptable and so those programs do<br>need to attend to academic bridging uh<br>to account for perhaps uh less than<br>ideal secondary school education they do<br>need to take care of things like child<br>care and transport but I think when they<br>start as students contributing to the<br>service load then they should be getting<br>paid and so I think earn as you learn is<br>a good idea now the reason my Joe's uh<br>anxious about the term is it invokes all<br>sorts of feral responses from some of<br>the senior nursing hierarchy who think<br>the shift away from hospital training to<br>University training was the best thing<br>that ever happened whereas I don't agree<br>with that perspective to answer your<br>other question Matt about um priorities<br>I think at a uh strategic Level Health<br>needs to shift to be seen as a service<br>industry and like any other service<br>industry needs to understand that it<br>lives and dies to serve the community<br>and that the community's needs<br>individual needs should drive the<br>process not as we've seen with that<br>literally half-baked reform the last<br>government of actually uh shifting all<br>the bureaucrats to Wellington and the<br>expectation that centralized command and<br>control might solve the problem that's<br>the antithesis of how Social indust<br>Service Industries work you need to<br>shift the decision making as close as<br>possible possible to where the services<br>are<br>delivered I think our health system also<br>needs to move without any uh excuse to a<br>values based system where we purchase on<br>the basis of the value proposition and<br>not on the basis of this nature of<br>employment or the type of process but uh<br>priorities I think in terms of a<br>tactical answer uh we first need to keep<br>this walker afloat and that is keeping<br>the workforce we've got in place and to<br>extend them so it's a it's an exercise<br>in retention and extension of the<br>existing Workforce in terms of the<br>second priority uh my second priority is<br>that the attention we should be focused<br>on as the business models in primary<br>care if we are to liberate our health<br>system and to generate the teaching<br>capacity and the service capacity we<br>need if we are to shift care out of the<br>hospitals into the community we need<br>completely different business model<br>models operating in primary care so uh<br>keep the Walker afloat and how do we get<br>to a I think the answer is uh by<br>addressing the the business model need<br>in primary care as a singular determin<br>Focus thank
