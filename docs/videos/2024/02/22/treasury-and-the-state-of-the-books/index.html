Craig we've got Eric<br>krampton uh Eric is the um Chief<br>Economist with the New Zealand<br>initiative welcome Eric thank you and uh<br>third uh panelist is Sarah Hogan<br>principal Economist of New Zealand in<br>Institute of economic research NZ I ER<br>so we're really looking forward to your<br>as always with these panels uh five<br>minutes of intro remarks and then we'll<br>move on to the Q&amp;A with slido up and<br>working and ready to take your questions<br>from the<br>sure thanks so much um there's a great<br>follow on from yesterday we had speakers<br>there saying the one big lesson that<br>they'd taken was the need for getting<br>back to fiscal consolidation when we<br>were finishing up the talks on Reserve<br>Bank and the advice that should be given<br>to the<br>government this morning we also heard<br>about the need for fiscal<br>consolidation and boy why weren't we<br>hearing this two years<br>ago it's a bit of a worry<br>So Co has taught me at least two pretty<br>awful lessons I don't know if they've<br>taught you the same lessons but they're<br>a little depressing for me first when<br>Parliament gives government a loose<br>Reign to deal with a crisis as it sees<br>necessary trusting that fiscal capacity<br>will be used for necessary purposes that<br>flexibility will be<br>abused core agencies May provide veiled<br>and sometimes not so veiled warning that<br>spending is difficult to justify but<br>ultimately neither they nor the Public<br>Finance act provide<br>discipline second New Zealand May well<br>be in a bob higs world and we do not<br>want to be in a bob higs world that<br>world sucks it means that we cannot<br>respond appropriately to crises when the<br>next one comes we'll take this latter<br>one first and then get back a bit to the<br>former so Bob higs you might not have<br>heard about him quite as much in New<br>Zealand but he was fairly prominent in<br>the US in the 1980s he wrote a book<br>called crisis in ithan and the basic<br>thesis of that book was that government<br>does a great job in increasing spending<br>during a crisis as we just heard<br>discussion on the ease of getting<br>spending measures going during a crisis<br>but then it has difficulty in fiscally<br>consolidating after the crisis he didn't<br>use the term Fiscal<br>consolidation the consequence of that is<br>a oneway ratchet effect in the size and<br>scope of<br>government ratchets up during the crisis<br>retrenches a little bit after the crisis<br>ratchets up in the next Crisis<br>retrenches a little bit afterwards so<br>it's a one-way ratchet effect now I<br>hadn't really thought that New Zealand<br>was in a bob higs world because if you<br>look back to the path of core Crown<br>expenditure as a fraction of<br>GDP the late 1990s Asian financial<br>crisis we had an increase in the size of<br>government but a substantial<br>retrenchment and it got back to normal<br>levels went back down to around 28% of<br>GDP uh by around 2005 2006<br>then we had the GFC ramps up again but<br>it Consolidated again back to about 28%<br>of GDP all right so the drill had been<br>crisis comes in government responds<br>government retrenches paying off the<br>debt getting things back in order and<br>there hadn't been a structural shift in<br>the size of government consequent to<br>these that has not been the case this<br>time around size of government increased<br>to over 35% of GD P at the peak and<br>during the election<br>campaign the National Party promised an<br>aspirational Target of getting core<br>Crown expenditure back down to maybe 30%<br>of GDP it's worth putting that in<br>context in the 2018 2019 first<br>well-being budget the grand well-being<br>budget the one that was going to solve<br>every problem New Zealand has ever had<br>or ever will have and was faded around<br>the world we've taken this new<br>well-being approach it's wonderful it's<br>great core Crown expenditure were<br>forecast for 2023 in that budget to be<br>28.8% of GDP we were going to solve<br>everything on 28.8% of<br>GDP luxen has promised to aspirationally<br>get maybe back down to<br>30% and even that is being characterized<br>often bip partisans as dangerous<br>austerity I think the danger runs the<br>other way if everyone expects that there<br>cannot be a retrenchment after a crisis<br>because that retrenchment will now be<br>cast as in partisan terms as being<br>dangerous austerity you will not ever<br>again get the kind of agreement that we<br>had in early 2020 that government needed<br>to be given the flexibility it needed to<br>deal with the crisis because it could be<br>trusted to deal with it well and that<br>there would be retrenchment afterwards<br>that it wasn't going to be a permanent<br>structural<br>shift so that's lesson one but also<br>during the during the spending there was<br>very little control on the quality of<br>spend so there might have been<br>occasional veiled warnings but remember<br>we were running make work programs<br>funded out of debt that Parliament<br>authorized for dealing with covid when<br>we had a substantial positive output Gap<br>in some of the lowest unemployment rates<br>we've ever seen nothing stopped it and<br>in 2021 when and the the treasury<br>secretary had given a talk on some of<br>the lessons of um covid<br>Laing some of the great successes<br>warranted on the wage subsidy scheme in<br>addition to what she just said about the<br>well accepted objectives for Effective<br>fiscal stimulus are that it is timely<br>temporary and targeted everybody agrees<br>on<br>that at the time she also said overall<br>New Zealand's fiscal response is Meeting<br>those objectives perhaps better than<br>most at a lot of terms terms it felt as<br>though treasury was giving the Finance<br>Minister cover for doing a lot of<br>nastiness measures of fiscal impulse in<br>the budget and economic fiscal updates<br>seemed designed to obscure rather than<br>Enlighten and to give Minister Robertson<br>a way to claim that he was in fact being<br>AER and responsible and managing the<br>books well because the fiscal response<br>the fiscal impulse is negative now all<br>that means is he's spending slightly<br>less than he spent last year and last<br>year was enormous amounts of spending<br>right so it made it very diff difficult<br>for those who were watching all of this<br>to be able to it was easy to frame<br>criticisms as being partisan because our<br>core institutions weren't standing up<br>and providing critique of spending that<br>was unwarranted I've probably hit my<br>time I am worried about our response the<br>next Crisis if we are unable to retrench<br>from this one and I'm worried that<br>ultimately the only thing that seems to<br>bind on spending is forcing Ministries<br>to have to fight with each other in a<br>vote process to show whose money is most<br>effective as soon as that was Gone with<br>over $50 billion of debt there was no<br>constraint anymore and that's pretty<br>depressing thank you thank you very much<br>Eric<br>great um can I start by thanking W<br>University for inviting me here for all<br>your work in organizing um this<br>conference conference um Anna you can<br>start the five minute clock now um<br>uh Carly and Adrian have spoken um very<br>eloquently this morning about our<br>changing environment and changing needs<br>um and the government has made its<br>commitment to change clear cuts of up to<br>7.5% across Public Services regardless<br>of rising need or Rising population<br>changes to tax systems that will reduce<br>Revenue by around $4.6 billion across<br>four years cuts to public spending on<br>public transport the end ofree<br>prescriptions reducing support for the<br>sick and vulnerable through changes to<br>welfare and just recently realterm cuts<br>to the minimum wage spending must be<br>paid back says the government why<br>because it must says the government<br>right now New Zealand's net debt is<br>21.7% actually this month 21.7% of GDP a<br>level described by standard and PO is<br>modest compared with that of most highly<br>rated Sovereign peers debt is $ 4.47<br>billion better than forecast at December<br>core Crown expenses at Hau are<br>forecasted decline each year as a<br>percentage of GDP until<br>2028 and that's before any changes from<br>the incoming government that last set of<br>figures also put our operating spend our<br>overall operating spending at$ 1.2<br>billion BS better than forecast again in<br>December this is not to say that<br>everything is Rosy in the government's<br>accounts it's clearly not um but it's<br>not in crisis either but our problem is<br>that we're looking at the account counts<br>to give us Direction and not at need we<br>understand our debt to two decimal<br>places whereas we have very little if<br>any understanding of how much money is<br>actually needed to maintain services and<br>our standard of living we understand the<br>costs of things but not their value<br>water infrastructure is a great example<br>here in New Zealand many councils across<br>New Zealand did not invest as needed<br>over many years as they were chasing<br>more pristine balance sheets and lower<br>rates bills hospitals had moled in the<br>walls because the government chased<br>accounting targets rather than meeting<br>our health needs in 2015 we returned<br>very tidy government accounts but we<br>also became a country where one in seven<br>children lived in material poverty<br>meaning they had not enough food clothes<br>or the other Essentials of life until we<br>better understand need and illustrate<br>the consequences of failing to deliver<br>that need we will never solve this<br>problem tax cuts can always look<br>attractive if it's not clear what you'll<br>be giving up to pay for them until 2015<br>treasury used to provide an analysis of<br>the spending needed to maintain health<br>and education services given population<br>and demographic change it no longer does<br>and I would argue it should it also<br>should provide that analysis in a much<br>wider range of areas including transport<br>climate change and<br>housing but understanding need will only<br>get us so far and this is surprisingly<br>where Eric and I<br>agree it's time to better understand the<br>value for money of our expenditure and<br>what we receive from public services<br>what the true costs are of failing to<br>invest at the right time to quote the<br>auditor general the technical phrase for<br>our reporting in this area is rubbish at<br>the election many hardworking public<br>servants were kicked around as back<br>office bureaucrats without any hard<br>analysis of what they were actually<br>delivering for new zealanders some<br>people made bold claims about wasteful<br>spending based upon no real assessment<br>at all the government's proposing to cut<br>billions of dollars in public investment<br>without currently providing any analysis<br>of what this will mean for New Zealand<br>now or in the<br>future yesterday we had lots of really<br>good discussion about social investment<br>and what I think it's really talking<br>about is a need to understand that value<br>for money better as The Economist Danny<br>rod wrote last month when he was talking<br>about industrial policy we need to be<br>clear sighted about what the objectives<br>are the kind of discipline that's<br>required is the discipline of monitoring<br>figuring out whether what you're doing<br>is working and being able to move away<br>from mistakes when they aren't working<br>successful policy is not about picking<br>winners it's about letting the losers go<br>I believe there's nothing inherently<br>rightwing about seeking better value for<br>money in government spending nor is<br>there anything inherently left-wing<br>about investing a sufficient amount of<br>money in public services it's in all of<br>our interests to get this right but<br>getting this right doesn't mean hitting<br>arbitrary accounting targets we had the<br>pleasure of two former prime ministers<br>on the stage yesterday one of them said<br>we have to constantly reflect upon who<br>we are as a people that should extend to<br>what we want for our public spending and<br>our Public Services too in the answer to<br>that unfortunately won't be found in the<br>treasury accounts or in just slipping<br>back to the way things were it will be<br>found in valuing things properly<br>assessing need correctly and delivering<br>things well regardless of whether or not<br>igal is in Surplus thank<br>you<br>Oto um I'm not a macroeconomist I'm a<br>health Economist most of my work focuses<br>on the health sector and touches on<br>areas relevant to social policy but the<br>Health and Social sectors a major driver<br>of what we see in treasury's books still<br>from where I stand what's in treasury's<br>books is less important than the value<br>we get from the money being spent and in<br>that sense I don't know that we're going<br>to get the jeweling economists that we<br>were set up to be this morning ideally<br>public sector spending should get us a<br>combination of things one of those is a<br>short-term return in terms of well-being<br>the other is long-term returns that<br>should be a really good balance of<br>well-being from those public services<br>that have been sustainably funded over<br>time but also some productivity growth<br>from the right kinds of investment that<br>help to ensure that we can continue to<br>spend when and where we need to if we<br>could be confident in value and we could<br>be confident in growth then we would be<br>less inclined to worry about whether<br>public spending is being dialed back at<br>any particular point in<br>time but it's not clear at all that we<br>do get good value for money from public<br>services using the health sector as an<br>example it always strikes me as ironic<br>that pharmac gets raked over the calls<br>for a lack of transparency and concerns<br>that its process of determining the<br>value of Investments is imperfect and I<br>don't mean to diminish in any way the<br>legitimate concerns that have been<br>raised about pharmac but my point is<br>that pharmac is the only part of the<br>health system system that has any<br>transparency at all regarding how<br>Investments are prioritized so much so<br>that in other parts of the sector it<br>isn't clear that investment<br>prioritization is done at all and we now<br>need to start making some really tough<br>decisions one of them is about things<br>like the role of physical infrastructure<br>in the health system um those who follow<br>the New Zealand infrastructure<br>commission will have noted a report that<br>came out yesterday which I was involved<br>in writing um which was forecasting the<br>expected um investment press for<br>physical infrastructure in the health<br>system over the next 30 Years um it's<br>not a good um picture of the future and<br>if we don't make some really tough<br>decisions and radically change the way<br>we do things it simply will not be<br>affordable to continue in the way we've<br>been<br>going comparing Investments across<br>sectors is even more<br>murky sometimes getting the best health<br>outcomes doesn't come from spending more<br>on health it might come from spending<br>more on housing or it might come from<br>spending more more in<br>education to get Assurance of value we<br>need more cost benefit analysis we need<br>more consistent use of cost benefit<br>analysis NZ has done a lot of work in<br>this space looking at how cost benefit<br>analysis is used in the public sector<br>and it's really patchy there's not a<br>strong belief in the value of evaluating<br>and appraising investments in that way<br>but we also need more social investment<br>thinking to make sure that we're<br>spending in the right places to get the<br>outcomes that we want Maria English gave<br>us a great example yesterday about<br>vulnerable people in um inappropriate<br>housing who were spending 100 nights a<br>year in hospital and once they were put<br>in the right kind of housing that was<br>reduced to 10 nights a year in hospital<br>and you compare that to how the health<br>sector might have tried and tried and<br>spent and spent to achieve the same<br>objective and it would not have been<br>possible so social investment is very<br>welcome um if it<br>returns um another thing that might make<br>us less concerned about the state of the<br>books um is a sense that that things<br>will balance out over time particularly<br>if we know that we're going into a<br>period of lower need for spending um or<br>a period of strong economic growth with<br>a health system that as Dez Gorman put<br>it yesterday is more like a disease and<br>injury management system with no ability<br>to plan for the future and with a<br>population dependency ratio that we're<br>moving towards the likes of which we<br>haven't seen since the early 60s and I<br>guess what I'd like to point out is that<br>what wasn't mentioned yesterday is that<br>while the population dependency ratio is<br>going to be similar in numbers to What<br>was seen in the early 60s when the<br>Boomers were children it is<br>fundamentally different in in this very<br>important way that in the 1960s you<br>could spend big on health and education<br>for children and know that you were<br>growing human capital it was an<br>investment that would pay dividends now<br>we're moving to a dependency ratio where<br>the high level of spending that will be<br>expected will be purely for wellbeing<br>not that that's not important but it's<br>not going to pay productivity dividends<br>in the long run now our older people do<br>deserve dignity and well-being and we<br>all need to trust and I'm glad that the<br>the concept of trust keeps coming up it<br>came up yesterday and it's come up again<br>today um we need to trust that those<br>things will be there in the future when<br>we need them in fact ends at IR we<br>published a public good paper on trust<br>and the importance of it in the health<br>sector and way the way the health the<br>way the health sector um goes about<br>relating to other organizations<br>providers between providers and with<br>communities medeka from Foo a yesterday<br>raised this issue of trust as well it's<br>fundamental in our relationship with the<br>public sector and with government it's<br>not just political trust it goes much<br>deeper than that as mcka said when<br>people lose trust they stop engaging<br>with services for economists another<br>concern is that they also stop engaging<br>with systems like the economic system<br>that relies on people to invest in their<br>own human capital and work they also<br>don't respond to incentives in the way<br>you might want them to instead they<br>spiral into worse disadvantage and fall<br>into<br>hopelessness because of<br>intergenerational disadvantage<br>hopelessness is something that a lot of<br>our young Mai face and as we heard in<br>yesterday's demography session young Mai<br>are a growing and undeniable part of our<br>future population and our future<br>Workforce to fail to adequately support<br>them to realize their potential for the<br>sake of balancing the books would be a<br>false<br>economy so instead of looking to spend<br>less overall we should be looking for as<br>Craig said<br>opportunities um to disinvest in what<br>doesn't work what doesn't provide value<br>we need to free up funds to um fund<br>those opportunities for sustained<br>investment in human capital where it's<br>desperately<br>needed in the health sector we urgently<br>need this shift that we've been talking<br>about for over 20 years to turn the<br>system on its head as Dez Gman would<br>like to see um to a system that's<br>powered by strong primary and Community<br>Care and helps people to be well not<br>just get well when they're deeply broken<br>that requires more spending in the short<br>to medium term and isn't going to save<br>us any money on the services that we're<br>currently spending until the longer<br>term we need to think creatively about<br>systems and lose the fear that engaging<br>with the private sector um which colors<br>our thinking in the health sector quite<br>a bit um as medeka from F award said<br>yesterday we should be looking at who<br>else is out there that might be able to<br>do better than what we've had for the<br>last two decades and maybe drop this<br>unwavering belief that government always<br>delivers the best quality Health and<br>Social<br>Services<br>you thank you very much Eric uh Craig<br>and Sarah for those introductory remarks<br>um there are of course lots of very<br>interesting questions including the<br>linkages between the different sessions<br>so they're coming through very very<br>strongly in this session today and I<br>think there will be linkages indeed with<br>the section with the session directly<br>afterwards on<br>infrastructure there was a surprising<br>amount of agreement between all of our<br>panelists given that their position on<br>some aspects of of uh fiscal management<br>might be rather different what I'd like<br>to ask a question about and I'm going to<br>start with with addressing it to Craig<br>and Eric and then we're going to<br>slightly direct it towards uh Health<br>when we when we ask a similar question<br>to you sir<br>but Craig and and Eric you know this<br>this issue of balancing priorities so in<br>some senses you agreed on the sort of<br>framework that we should use we need<br>value we need to be doing the right<br>things how do we balance the priorities<br>though in particularly how should the<br>treasury balance short run urgent<br>priorities with the need to ensure<br>longterm fiscal sustainability and I<br>wonder if you could be quite specific<br>about how do we balance these priorities<br>in terms of your own perspectives and I<br>think that you might have some slightly<br>different views on how we do this even<br>though your overall framework is<br>similar so shortterm longterm sure in<br>the in the short run um for example to<br>give you a very specific example um the<br>current government is proposing to uh<br>change the uh CPI um the adjustment for<br>welfare um from uh from wages to CPI and<br>that will save it somewhere in the order<br>of $700 million across the forecast<br>period um it's planning on handing back<br>um a um the mortgage interest dedu<br>ability um to landlords across the same<br>forecast period that's going to cost<br>about $3 billion um if your proposal to<br>balance the books or to get things back<br>on track is to take money from some of<br>the poorest and most vulnerable people<br>in the country get a better plan um<br>because right now we're going to be<br>taking that money which is which goes<br>into local economies which is needed<br>which has a which has a which is not is<br>not saved is not disappearing to Aruba<br>for a tax holiday um and it's we're<br>giving that money to landlords who've<br>already done pretty well over the past<br>30 years and are rent rent increases are<br>cly 4.5% which is the second highest<br>rate they've been on record um that's<br>that's not where your priorities should<br>lie and I don't think that's a political<br>decision that's a fairly straightforward<br>economic um decision um so I think in<br>terms of um there there are very<br>straightforward things that you can do<br>but underpinning all of this is a really<br>strong need to make sure we have a<br>long-term plan for investment and<br>long-term plans for health and education<br>where we provide the kinds of certainty<br>that allow them to do proper planning<br>and do proper investment and part of the<br>problem that we've had is that we've had<br>we had periods of time where health and<br>education in particular have seen a<br>scarcity of investment there we had<br>years where there was no capital<br>investment um in health and that is what<br>leads to this Feast of famine problem in<br>terms of delivering those Public<br>Services thanks ER cool there there's a<br>few different aspects all going on at<br>the the same time here I'll Focus down<br>on just one to begin with so if we're<br>thinking about different kinds of<br>program spend and then whether it's<br>consistent with long-term outcomes well<br>you are not going to have or you<br>shouldn't have you will not have earned<br>support for the level of Taxation that's<br>necessary to fund extensive Social<br>Services if you cannot demonstrate the<br>value that is provided by them so if you<br>are doing the short-term stuff right you<br>are building the support that is<br>necessary for the increases in taxes<br>that might be necessary to cover the<br>cost of it now I'm agnostic about<br>whether some of these these things wind<br>up proving their value but if they do<br>well that that's how that's how it turns<br>out right um if instead you're just<br>throwing money at stuff which we kind of<br>have been doing there was a framework in<br>place for assessing this stuff up<br>through about 2017 then it all got<br>thrown away um effectively the the<br>investment approach that English had set<br>up was abandoned by seone we stopped<br>measuring these things in terms of<br>outcomes or against a long-term fiscal<br>measure and now we've got an awful lot<br>of spending that's difficult to justify<br>I would um push back on the framing<br>around tax cuts versus uh on the<br>incidents on all of this stuff it just<br>go should go down to First principles<br>does it make sense to treat<br>a business that is providing rental<br>tencies different from other businesses<br>in terms of tax treatment if it isn't on<br>first principles then don't do it<br>regardless of what whether you like<br>landlords or think that they're evil<br>right tax policy shouldn't depend on<br>that it and similarly if you think that<br>the point of benefits is to make sure<br>that people can keep up with an adequate<br>consumption<br>bundle then set it anchor it on CPI for<br>other reasons you think that it should<br>be keeping up with other things well you<br>can have it set to keep up with other<br>things but then you can't productivity<br>your way out of the spend out of the uh<br>cost of it so just on that one aspect<br>make sure that you got the short-term<br>spend properly Justified and evaluated<br>then you have the support to make sure<br>that the long term can sort itself out<br>but we sure aren't there y Sarah on on<br>health you talked about it quite a bit<br>in your in your uh in your initial<br>comments but this is there a difference<br>in how we think about the short-term and<br>long-term priorities in in health or do<br>you agree with Eric that you know you<br>build the short-term right and you the<br>the long RM will will sort itself out um<br>almost no I definitely would disagree if<br>that were what Eric meant um we need a<br>long-term vision for health we need to<br>know what we're trying to get to it<br>takes a really long time to make changes<br>that shift the system in the way that<br>we've been talking about for 20 years<br>and unfortunately haven't made a lot of<br>progress on um and I think what's really<br>important not just in health but in a<br>lot of social sector spending as well is<br>that when we're thinking short term and<br>longterm it's coming back to that<br>balance that I talked about where some<br>of the spending is actually supporting<br>well-being in the short term and some of<br>the spending is supporting productivity<br>and economic growth um and when there<br>isn't a lot available to spend we should<br>be looking for that intersection in the<br>vend diagram those areas where you can<br>spend where it supports short-term<br>well-being but also will contribute<br>something to economic growth and future<br>and and ideally spending that is<br>targeted to Children particularly<br>vulnerable children um and executed in<br>the right way could potentially achieve<br>both of those yeah so in health you've<br>got that very specific example of of<br>focusing on some short-term spending<br>having those very long run um uh payoffs<br>I'm curious you know we're thinking<br>still on this short-term long term so I<br>know Eric you had some more comments on<br>that and and perhaps to to to to to uh<br>recharacterize my my character<br>characterization of your comments um if<br>do you have any comments on how we can<br>overcome the Distortion to fiscal policy<br>priorities and shortsightedness that<br>comes from this three-year election<br>cycle so rather more specifically can we<br>focus in on this three-year election<br>cycle perhaps Eric I'll go to VI first<br>one okay so by that you mean just the<br>imperative to get uh a spending program<br>through to get you through the next<br>election cycle<br>well that's that's how I'm hearing the<br>question I'm not sure if that's what you<br>meant by it I think it's a question<br>through from SL my understanding if my<br>understanding of the question is you<br>know the three-year election cycle is<br>this posing problems for short run<br>versus long run um<br>coherence it doesn't<br>necessarily uh there are some arguments<br>around four-year terms<br>there's people can argue the toss over<br>that one but better me act actual<br>metrics on the quality of the spend so<br>that it was obvious to voters whether<br>something that's being pitched during<br>election campaign or spending that's<br>happened in the election year if that<br>actually stacked up if there was a good<br>evidential case for it if there were<br>Targets on it I'm thinking back again<br>the well-being budget uh $1.9 billion in<br>mental health at the time I was asking<br>okay do you have any framework for<br>assessment how do you even know what<br>you're going to be spending the money on<br>no they didn't they were just they<br>wanted an announc basically and there's<br>no no nothing around it and then it lead<br>up to it it was still ahead of 2020 but<br>there's even no rigor at that point<br>right<br>um getting stronger rigor in that kind<br>of public reporting so that voters had<br>so voters don't have to just go to their<br>trusted pundit like like right Wingers<br>might say oh crampton's right and left<br>Wingers might say oh well renie's right<br>and they'll they'll both say that the<br>other one's rubbish<br>but if you've got the regular assessment<br>coming out of the core government<br>institutions saying okay here is the<br>value for money assessment that's come<br>up with this one oh and actually here's<br>a big red flag because they would refuse<br>to provide one or they forbid us from<br>doing one right if you had more of that<br>so that voters could decide for<br>themselves whether any of the stuff made<br>sense or whether it was an election<br>bribe I think would be helpful some more<br>transparency of information I guess is<br>and rigor in the evaluation of it I I I<br>mean we we largely agree on because I<br>mean the first thing I would say is how<br>do you get around a three-year electoral<br>cycle stop having a three-year electoral<br>cycle um you know if please let's have a<br>four-year one or a five-year one because<br>it it makes I I really enjoy elections<br>but even I um you know find a threee<br>electoral term a bit short and it really<br>does mean that governments are thinking<br>about a new term right at the start<br>Thomas Ki wrote about this many many<br>years ago and he still not wrong um so<br>there are you know places move to a a<br>new cycle um in this space but um the<br>one thing the one thing I would perhaps<br>differ on with Eric on there is that<br>what we don't understand in that<br>process's need um so we can make<br>assessments of value for money about is<br>policy a better than policy B um in an<br>area but actually there's an underlying<br>level of need um and you can have a<br>policy that's fantastic but it's only<br>delivering to two people you're not<br>actually addressing the need which is to<br>two million people um and so you<br>actually need to have much better<br>understanding of need in in health and<br>education we we have a $210 billion<br>infrastructure Gap in New Zealand and it<br>sort of turned up out of the blue<br>because we had the national<br>infrastructure unit sort of turn up and<br>say hey we've had a piece of work done<br>and this is the size of the Gap now we<br>can argue about whether or not that's<br>the right number or not but there's a<br>very large infrastructure Gap that just<br>appeared um we all we all see it we know<br>every time you go to a hospital you see<br>it every time anyone walks around the<br>streets of Wellington and sees the leaks<br>on the roads they see it um but no no no<br>voter had information for a very long<br>period of time about the growth in that<br>infrastructure Gap so as well as<br>assessing value for money which is<br>essential um we also should be assessing<br>need because that allows you to make<br>that important trade-off am I going to<br>take cash today as opposed to address<br>that need and if I do that what am I<br>going to get in the future if I address<br>that need today and so I think both of<br>those things need to come together and<br>in one final point of I made toar Le's<br>point which I think was an excellent one<br>um around whether or not an independent<br>fiscal institution is necessary in New<br>Zealand I'm a long-standing supporter of<br>an IFI um in New Zealand um but I<br>actually think one of the areas where<br>which is missing is in the post<br>expenditure justification of expenditure<br>and the post justification expend<br>analysis of that expenditure and being<br>independent of everyone in that and I<br>think that's an area where we really<br>could look at strengthening the existing<br>physical institutions in New Zealand<br>thanks for those comments Sarah in terms<br>of um Health in particular this<br>three-year election cycle does it cause<br>particular problems in in the health<br>funding area do you think do you think<br>we need a a longer election cycle or I I<br>think the threeyear cycle is a problem I<br>think that the um we could go a bit<br>longer as Craig says four years five<br>years why not but actually a lot of the<br>issues that we're talking about are 20<br>and 30-y year issues they're one<br>generation to the next and so we're<br>never going to have an electoral cycle<br>that's that long um so we need something<br>else that helps governments to commit to<br>something and I guess as much as I'm<br>hearing Craig and and Eric agree it<br>ought to be possible to have some kind<br>of cross party agreement on what the<br>long-term future of New Zealand looks<br>like because where we actually will see<br>disagreement is not what the future<br>should look like but actually how to get<br>there um but at least if we can nail<br>down what the future looks like and I<br>don't think that's been done I don't<br>think that um new zealanders are clear<br>on um what the future looks like and and<br>how we might all agree first um and then<br>again it's about the information and the<br>accountability how are we spending what<br>are we doing what's the theory of change<br>what's the intervention Logic for the<br>current spending in terms of how that<br>connects to that long-term<br>vision and of course you know talking<br>about the extension extension of the<br>election Cycles we're talking maybe four<br>to five years of course there are there<br>are countries that that have leadership<br>for much longer than that and and I'm<br>not sure that that always brings<br>unambiguous uh benefits to the country<br>so there are these tensions between this<br>very sort of long long-sighted potential<br>view uh the good thing is it's<br>long-sighted the bad thing is you've got<br>it for a very long time whether you<br>whether you like it or or not um which<br>sort of I I very much agree in sort of<br>the only thing I say is that I don't<br>think we'll get agreement on what is<br>needed um political parties by<br>definition will disagree about what what<br>what a good future looks like and that's<br>fine that's that's democracy that's<br>great but certainly a long-term view of<br>of of what need is what our population<br>looks like how many hospitals we need in<br>particular places how many schools we<br>need in particular places we don't have<br>a great we have very little<br>understanding right now about where we<br>should be spending capital in the Health<br>Service and the extent to which that<br>should be in primary care or in big<br>hospitals around the country and I think<br>that's where we could have a a a much<br>stronger level of agreement so maybe we<br>do actually disagree because I can't see<br>how you can quantify what is needed<br>until you know what the end goal is and<br>if you don't agree on what the end goal<br>is then you're not going to agree on<br>what's needed to get<br>there that's one characteristic of Mega<br>projects that go wrong right when people<br>disagree what the what the goals are you<br>end up with the cost lows because people<br>keep changing Scopes I like to think<br>more about Frameworks for discovering<br>what the long-term goal should be than<br>about what the long-term goal should be<br>I love the the idea of De devolving<br>services and delivery down to local<br>communities within accountability<br>framework so that if they're<br>demonstrating value in providing<br>outcomes that the Ministries would other<br>be Prov otherwise be providing and are<br>better at it that they wind up with the<br>funding and that is what emerges because<br>they are better at delivering that value<br>and if they aren't well then that<br>doesn't emerge but you wouldn't want to<br>prescribe at the outset well it should<br>all be by NOS or it should all be by<br>this kind of thing or the other we<br>should we should be able to agree on<br>Frameworks more easily than<br>outcomes the challenge there is then<br>making sure that you have the<br>Performance Management Frameworks in<br>that space and that's a really difficult<br>Challenge and a really difficult thing<br>to live and something we don't have a<br>great deal of experience of in New<br>Zealand at have to build it and we're<br>we're running very short on on time here<br>there are lots of interesting questions<br>that are coming through one I was going<br>to quickly ask you was is the push for<br>current I'm not going to let you answer<br>it but you can choose to answer it and<br>your final remarks is the push for tax<br>cuts fiscally irresponsible in the<br>current envir environment um we could go<br>with a yes no but what I prefer to do<br>since we've only got a minute and a half<br>or so uh remaining in this session is<br>given the overall um focus of of this<br>forum which is the briefing to the<br>incoming government what's your um 45<br>second key message in terms of fiscal<br>policy in terms of Treasury the state of<br>the books what's your key message to<br>this incoming government Sarah we might<br>start with with you if um I think the<br>key message is that ultimately that<br>long-term sustainability of services and<br>the ability for the government to keep<br>some space to be able to ramp things up<br>in future crisis means that right now<br>what we should be doing is really<br>focusing right down on um the high<br>priority areas for me that's young Mai<br>um because we know the demographic shift<br>that's about to happen and we know that<br>there is this long-term disadvantage<br>that ultimately we're going to have to<br>break the back off thanks cool I would<br>put separate it out between a sort of<br>short to medium-term and the longer term<br>and the short to medium-term retrenching<br>from the covid crisis is essential you<br>could fairly simply what was the<br>percentage of GDP associated with each<br>budget line item in the well great<br>well-being budget of 2019 and that<br>should be the target for every budget<br>line that's a continued one from 2019<br>like you're they're going to be damned<br>whether they if for 6 and a half% Cuts<br>or any any level you might as well get<br>it down at least to what are has<br>promised if you're pretending to be<br>fiscally conservative because that<br>wasn't a fiscally conservative budget<br>but from there make sure you have a<br>rigorous framework for assessing whether<br>other programs within a social<br>investment approach that they want to<br>return to make sure that everything is<br>set for assessment and especially around<br>devolved Services locally local<br>communities NOS e and Hau that'll be<br>pretty<br>critical I'm very briefly because in a<br>hor of time um uh my my advice would be<br>what my advice would be was to the the<br>income Li government in 2017 think<br>really hard um and then stop go away and<br>then think really hard again um because<br>what we have is we have we have a<br>situation in which the government is<br>proposing to do a range of things it's<br>made a range of promises and in a in a<br>range of areas um some of those will not<br>stand the test of time and and stop and<br>have a think stop and think about<br>whether or not actually what is it you<br>really want to achieve how are you going<br>to deliver that and have the courage if<br>necessary to say the context has changed<br>and we actually need to do things<br>differently because we want to achieve<br>what I think everybody wants which is<br>the greater wellbeing of all new<br>zealanders and we've seen remarkable<br>sort of convergence of of objectives yes<br>everybody's got the same objective<br>actually quite a lot of convergence in<br>the Frameworks that you all our<br>panelists would like to think about<br>these there are some differences in the<br>micro but certainly there strong push<br>for better analysis more information<br>more transparency that helps uh<br>contribute to this debate and hopefully<br>this panel is is one of those<br>significant contributors to this<br>discussion thank you very much to uh our<br>uh panelists for those very very<br>wonderful um uh insights into a range of<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
