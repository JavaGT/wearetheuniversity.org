re retake the<br>table<br>and we uh we chatted a little earlier<br>and we're going to start this one with<br>you Maria because the term social<br>investment must have been mentioned 10<br>times by other speakers today but uh<br>before we go down the panel to get views<br>from others can you just give us a<br>little bit about impact lab and also a<br>definition of social investment so we<br>know what we're talking about yeah<br>absolutely well um t<br>tala it's great to be here and yeah<br>probably a few people are wondering what<br>the heck is social investment people are<br>talking about it um so I guess impact<br>lab was really um founded and created to<br>bring the tools of social investment<br>particularly to the community um and it<br>was founded out of some analysis that<br>came out of government uh which<br>basically looked at over the lifetime of<br>every New Zealander what does each of<br>our interaction or Journeys with<br>government look like uh and how much<br>investment actually happens in our lives<br>uh and that analysis showed that about<br>15% of new zealanders actually use half<br>of all government Social Services<br>excluding<br>superannuation over their lifetime um<br>and those are the new zealanders with<br>the most complex lives um about yeah<br>700,000 or so people uh and the<br>productivity commission has recently<br>described it as it's people who are<br>living in persistent disadvantage so<br>facing uh barriers in terms of poverty<br>social exclusion and lack of access to a<br>like health and housing that prevent uh<br>people being able to even form hopes for<br>the future uh and to be able to go after<br>those so the question really is how do<br>we make our investment work for new<br>zealanders and particularly for those<br>who most need services that are<br>effective at supporting their<br>aspirations uh so in terms of social<br>investment as a toolkit we really see it<br>as I guess a set of principles uh for<br>approaching investing in changing lives<br>and I think what's really interesting is<br>these principles can be applied right<br>through the system from the level of a<br>minister signing off a billion policy<br>package right through to a social worker<br>sitting with aano talking about their<br>priorities for this week uh so those<br>principles are firstly taking a customer<br>focus so that's really about rather than<br>expecting customers to adapt themselves<br>to Social Services adapting the services<br>to the needs of those customers uh so<br>for example impact lab worked with a a<br>digital literacy charity um that shared<br>with us that there had been a very well<br>funded government initiative in the far<br>north to help give kids access to<br>laptops and Technology who didn't have<br>it uh but after about a year only 20<br>kids had enrolled in this program and<br>when they asked why it turned out the<br>form for signing up for the program the<br>first page of it asked about financial<br>details and it looked like a a bank form<br>and a lot of the far know they were<br>trying to reach had debt problems so<br>they did not want to go near that form<br>so they then redesigned the whole on<br>boarding process and they were able to<br>reach uh over 240 kids in the next 12-<br>month period so taking a customer focus<br>is is that first principle the second is<br>taking an investment-based framework to<br>decision making and I would say probably<br>the traditional social services funding<br>framework is cost based so we report on<br>how much money we spent and we stopped<br>there an investment framework is about<br>saying not just what's the cost but<br>what's the value from an investment<br>perspective for these people's lives in<br>the long term so uh impact lab worked<br>recently with a community housing<br>provider that houses people with severe<br>and persistent mental health needs and<br>when we looked at data from the former<br>dhb for their area for those tenants we<br>saw that in the 5 years before they got<br>tailored and appropriate housing those<br>tenants had an average of 100 nights a<br>year that they were spending in hospital<br>so a third of those people's lives they<br>were spending in a hospital bed and many<br>of them in forensic units uh because<br>theyve committed crimes related to their<br>mental health uh which I know James you<br>were talking about earlier so so that<br>was the before picture but then after<br>the people got appropriate housing the<br>average number of nights they spend in<br>hospital in the next year was 10 so it<br>dropped from 100 to 10 and it stayed low<br>for the next 5 years so we were able<br>calculate that saves that that dhb $5<br>million and when we look at the impact<br>on those tenants lives in terms of their<br>mental health their physical wellness<br>their um stability of tenure their<br>academic uh engagement of their children<br>we saw that there's a 4X return on the<br>dollar spent spending more to<br>appropriately house those people so<br>shifting from cost to Value through an<br>investment framework is the second thing<br>and then the third principle um is<br>feedback thinking so once we know this<br>if we can know not just that we spent<br>some money but who did we reach how did<br>the investment make a difference to<br>their lives and what does that mean for<br>the long-term ability of those people to<br>achieve their aspirations what are we<br>going to do with that knowledge uh and<br>so a core part of social investment is<br>getting a feedback loop going where we<br>can use the information flow to improve<br>the next set of decisions and and really<br>the core of what we do at impact lab is<br>work with NOS government and businesses<br>to get that feedback Lo going within<br>their own organizations so so far we've<br>worked with over 250 organizations we've<br>measured the long-term impact or<br>estimated it really of about $600<br>million of investment and I think<br>there's real opportunity to get that<br>Loop reaching further up into the<br>bureaucracy to guide um the decisions<br>that happen at the policy level<br>brilliant thank you thanks Med pick take<br>please thank<br>you<br>first of all I welcome the opportunity<br>today to have a conversation with you<br>about social<br>investment and you I say that because I<br>think well thank god somebody is<br>starting to Cotton On because it's been<br>a long time coming and so I welcome the<br>opportunity to share with you what uh<br>social investment is and uh it's not<br>rocket science it is investing in the<br>potential of Alano it is as simple as<br>that and so we like to complicate things<br>and for the last 10 and I see Lady moxom<br>here today for the last 20 years some of<br>us have been out there actually doing<br>social<br>investment and that's why we believe in<br>the potential of<br>ouro and if you don't believe in the<br>potential of youro then we will continue<br>continue to invest as we have been doing<br>for the last since myano for the last we<br>long time and so it is a time that we<br>think we change our thinking in terms of<br>alfano that come to be supported at the<br>time that is most necessary for<br>them and I cheer the final water<br>commissioning agency and have done so<br>for the past 10 years so when I see the<br>statistics go up and when I hear people<br>talk about Mar Faro then then is the<br>work that I do that is the work that<br>lady moxom does so we're not talking<br>about somewhere out there people out<br>there that is The Daily Grind that the<br>uh<br>providers over a hundred of them up and<br>down the country do and we love to have<br>conversations with people such as you<br>all because we've constantly hear about<br>growing the economy the need to grow the<br>economy but what we say is hang on on a<br>moment let's start growing the people of<br>Alor let's start growing that large<br>growing sector of Faro who need to be<br>included who must have a place in the<br>ongoing development of<br>Alo and so we that's our Mahi and so it<br>was well over 10 a dozen years ago then<br>we thought we're not going to continue<br>to say that our people are mad bad or<br>sad we must look to their potential<br>and we must fund on their<br>potential we must make sure that we<br>invest<br>longterm for transformational change<br>that will make a difference for the<br>Faro uh<br>77% of the final order providers are M<br>owned we're M owned our boards are M our<br>executive of Mali the staff of Mali and<br>the client group of Mali so it's by M<br>for Mar with Marty nothing less nothing<br>less because it's about<br>trust that's the other thing it's about<br>trust and I hear so many people talk<br>about what they want to do and support<br>and I understand that to support to<br>shift the dial for<br>alfano but unless you can get in the<br>door unless you are the face that is<br>seen the face that is respected the face<br>that is known the person that sub uh<br>suspends judgment then you won't make a<br>difference and it'll be the continuation<br>of money going down a big black hole<br>that is the social welfare<br>spend so I absolutely as such a<br>supporter of um social investment we<br>call it Foo<br>investment we get alongside our Foo they<br>underpin everything that we do they<br>inform everything that we do otherwise<br>we're just thinking oh well this is what<br>they need hey if we got a deal for you<br>have a look at this product have a look<br>at this and that's not what they need<br>and the one thing you'll find about<br>people now is that they walk if you<br>can't provide what they need at the time<br>that they need it most by the people who<br>are trusted then Faro walk and sadly<br>that cost Al considerable dollars so the<br>time for wasted spend is over the time<br>for having the right people advising the<br>government developing the policies<br>making sure you don't fund for a<br>continued the dismal sta statistics that<br>we always have the time is right now<br>with the new government who I believe<br>are<br>receptive to new ways I heard that this<br>morning from the Deputy Prime Minister<br>wants to look for new things to do wants<br>to cut the waste of spending and I<br>certainly do and I I wouldn't hesitate<br>if I was the minister Deputy Prime<br>Minister to go through and see where<br>some of the dollars are currently going<br>there should be no sacred cows<br>everything should be on the table and if<br>the statistics haven't Pro have not<br>improved in the last 3 to five years or<br>a dozen years then bang they're out move<br>over for people who can do the job<br>because that's how dire it is in<br>Alo so we've got economists looking at<br>growing the economy and I'm saying hand<br>in hand when growing the economy goes<br>hand in hand and growing the people who<br>need to be part of the future of<br>Al they need to see a place for<br>themselves the poor somebody said to me<br>today I didn't sell off uh the state<br>houses meta but I'd love to be able to<br>get into a warm<br>house so what we do when we talk to our<br>families and you might I'm sure you're<br>not surprised about this a dozen years<br>ago we said what would a what what is it<br>that you<br>want and they said well Lexi map we'd<br>like to live well<br>I saidwell come on I'll tease that out a<br>bit what does that mean well we'd like a<br>nice home we'd like a warm home we'd<br>like some good jobs so that we can<br>support Alo we'd like to have easy<br>access to Affordable Health Care it's<br>nothing more or less than what you and I<br>want and that's quite simple so why on<br>Earth do we continue to fund oneoff<br>programs usually a pilot and if it's<br>successful oh move it on move it out and<br>people the result of that is that people<br>get impacted and then after a while they<br>say we don't want anything to do with<br>what's currently being provided and then<br>we say oh well they're not they're not<br>willing to come on board in fact most<br>families who are experiencing difficulty<br>are so if we want transformational<br>change then we need to change the<br>mindset of the people who are actually<br>um ensuring that there is sufficient<br>funding and investment going into to<br>where it's needed we need to have the<br>right people there we need to think<br>intergenerationally long term and we<br>need to support the people and just and<br>and and I believe say to them that you<br>are<br>important you are important to the<br>future of alaro this is not an a team<br>and A B team in<br>ALA everybody has the right to say I<br>want to play a part and my children to<br>have a great future in our great<br>country so lady moxim and I have been<br>doing that work for the last 20 years<br>and I'm so pleased Maria and to see you<br>also Professor that you're also<br>supportive of social investment for us<br>it is investing in the potential of<br>Alano and it has to be done by the right<br>people supported by the government and<br>hopefully um the econ economists will do<br>their figures and see the value of it as<br>well we have our own researches our own<br>data because we never trust what's<br>P sorry<br>Maria got a pick up Michael as an<br>economist what's your you're welcome<br>it's a it's a hard act to follow um I I<br>want to pick up on a couple of points<br>that were made um earlier in the day um<br>so Minister Willis uh gave us four words<br>that I think pretty much sum up social<br>investment to me we can do better and I<br>think that that really gets to the heart<br>of what social investment is about we<br>can do better and and Professor Gorman<br>um sort of trumped me a little bit in<br>terms of my comments because he said<br>some of the things that I was going to<br>say which was it's about generating the<br>most value from the least cost because<br>that's how I see things um it's about<br>cost Effectiveness it's about generating<br>the most good uh from the what we spend<br>because we have a limited uh we have a<br>limited amount that we can spend on<br>social outcomes and we want to be able<br>to do the best that we can with that um<br>and you might sit there and think well<br>Professor Cameron you're just an<br>economist and that's what all economists<br>say um so uh let me just uh finish with<br>a with a couple of quotes from<br>non-economists uh on that point uh Toby<br>y who's a uh he's a philosopher and<br>ethicist<br>Australian uh he is very much in favor<br>of cost effess cost Effectiveness uh he<br>says uh when you've got a limited budget<br>cost Effectiveness is the right thing to<br>do you generate the most good from what<br>you're spending um Hans rosling who is a<br>uh medical physician uh some of you<br>might know him as the founder of the Gap<br>minder uh website uh he said that coste<br>Effectiveness uh is the most<br>compassionate thing that we can do and I<br>think that those are important points um<br>um but I want to come back to that we<br>can do better because we do need to<br>interrogate what we mean by better um<br>and that's the challenge that we<br>probably most face is in working out how<br>can we measure what it is that we're<br>doing how can we work out what it is uh<br>that the right outcomes are how we<br>measure them and how we ensure that<br>we're getting better for what we're<br>spending thanks Michael all right<br>there's a few questions come in but I<br>first want to dive into a little bit of<br>mechanics about how this works so Maria<br>I've seen some of your reports I've I<br>was looking at uh one of the funo auto<br>reports on a Innovative education<br>program there's I think it's easy for<br>anybody in the room to think about what<br>somebody might be spending you know here<br>was a program it cost a million bucks it<br>cost half a million<br>bucks how in a practical sense does it<br>work to then say um the the case of less<br>nights and Emer Department okay we can<br>probably cost that how in a practical<br>sense might an<br>agency public or private think about the<br>value of human potential ofo potential<br>as you've spoken about Meda um the value<br>of reduced mental anguish how do you do<br>that to come up with a figure that says<br>this is worth 2x 3x 4X the<br>investment yeah so we've spent about<br>four years on that and um the data<br>people in the room will not be surprised<br>to learn we're still a far far away from<br>where we want to get to um but our<br>ultimate view is to improve the data we<br>have to use what we have um so we we<br>work with a lot of really small<br>Charities there might be um a team of<br>five plus 20 volunteers who are now<br>doing a better job answering that<br>question than what ministers have access<br>to when making um hundred million<br>funding decisions and that's just<br>because of the ability we now have to<br>use technology to collapse the cost of<br>accessing an analyzing data so what kind<br>of data are we looking at well obviously<br>there's the cost side I would say um 90%<br>of the 250 organizations we've worked<br>with so far that are delivering Social<br>Services have never calculated their<br>cost per person or their cost per family<br>so that Financial um data is sitting<br>there uh but they're not actually asked<br>for it so I wouldn't um I wouldn't<br>underestimate the usefulness of simply<br>looking at the cost uh which most or<br>ganizations don't do on on a purpose<br>level then in terms of the value we look<br>at a couple of drivers so it's really<br>about who are you reaching and what's<br>the opportunity to make a difference for<br>those people what kind of outcomes<br>matter to those people and and and<br>what's the impact if you can achieve<br>them and how effective do we think a<br>certain intervention can be at achieving<br>those things so from an opportunity<br>perspective that's really about<br>understanding the past what's been the<br>story of the people that you're working<br>with um prior to the point that they<br>they've met your service or the service<br>that you're funding um so for example in<br>the the case of that community housing<br>provider I mentioned um we've got people<br>who are spending a 100 days a year in<br>hospital now A Mental Health Service<br>working with um the student who stressed<br>about exams has a very different<br>opportunity in relation to the kind of<br>Mental Health Challenge they're<br>experiencing so that's the first kind of<br>data then the second kind of data is uh<br>in terms of the present what's the<br>effectiveness of the thing that you're<br>actually doing and there we work to try<br>and figure out well what actually is the<br>intervention because we find often<br>government agencies don't actually know<br>what the thing is that they're funding<br>in terms of how someone experiences a<br>service uh and what reasons do we have<br>to believe people are engaging with it<br>um so we worked recently with a phone<br>line for people with money trouble uh<br>and when we looked at the data we found<br>that 60% of people who called the line<br>didn't stay on long enough to get<br>meaningful help of any kind but those<br>people are being counted in the stats as<br>is engaging but they're not actually so<br>so understanding from an operational<br>perspective are the parents turning up<br>to the first week of the parenting<br>course and dropping out or are they<br>staying for the 30 weeks so that's the<br>second kind of data in the present what<br>does engagement look like and then the<br>Third Kind is well what are the outcomes<br>that we're trying to aim for here and<br>what's the value if we can achieve them<br>that's the hardest bit that's the bit<br>the economists will want to debate about<br>the most because of course there's a<br>million different angles for valuing<br>positive change um and we've kind of<br>come to the place I think a few speakers<br>have mentioned which is what matters<br>most is what outcomes are farno<br>prioritizing and then how can we get<br>some view of whether those are happening<br>um so we partnered with a Pacific Fino<br>order provider where they had worked<br>with families identified some<br>unsurprising outcome areas like we want<br>housing we want our kids educated and we<br>want to be healthy uh and then we could<br>layer in a whole lot of proxy data from<br>Academia and from government to<br>understand well can we see educational<br>engagement or attainment increasing and<br>if it can increase what's the impact on<br>family income what's the impact on the<br>fiscal cost for government of reduction<br>and Welfare liability what's the impact<br>on health of of being employed um so we<br>just stack those up and and in our case<br>we monetize that to a dollar figure<br>which we call social return on<br>investment so that we can compare it to<br>the cost that went in so you can sort of<br>see um it's a very imperfect process um<br>but if we're starting from zero<br>confidence and no information challenge<br>I give my team including Mari who's here<br>today is how do we build up confidence<br>or test our assumptions to improve the<br>investment decision sorry that was a<br>long answer don't worry we're at an<br>economics Forum you go and Michael<br>you've probably got some thoughts on the<br>data but hold that because I I want to<br>come back to you on some of those data<br>questions in a minute Miner I'm going to<br>pass to you you spoke about the team<br>they out there engag enging witho every<br>day as you say this is not theoretical<br>it's it's it's just what the work is day<br>today you've also talked and Maria you<br>have too that often what we're talking<br>about is people with exceptionally<br>complex lives things aren't always going<br>well and that's a combination of a lot<br>of different factors it might be housing<br>Education Health um how do you take a<br>model like that and scale it how do you<br>I think it might be a 90 or 100 star<br>that you talked out there the the the<br>scale of the challenge is so big how do<br>you take that data informed view but<br>also the relational View and do that at<br>a greater scale well it is it is about<br>relationships there's no doubt about<br>that and we have to look at the the<br>total uh Faro when we deal when we're um<br>supporting our Faro if you're just going<br>to say well there's an issue with<br>housing and focus on addressing that<br>without addressing everything everything<br>else that's happening in that Faro um<br>you won't get very far so to scale up<br>you have to work with the pho and the<br>pho themselves eventually become I<br>suppose you could say the I won't use<br>role model but they become become the<br>influencer on the rest of their of their<br>Foo themselves Foos see the changes that<br>are made orbe it initially they might be<br>quite small but Faro see the Chang that<br>is made and then they start to think<br>about where can they access the services<br>that might support them who's providing<br>the services and so you can scale up in<br>that in in that regard and the other<br>thing too is we can't do it all on our<br>own so we look to collaborate with other<br>providers within our within the<br>communities up and actually up and down<br>the country and also there are some<br>significant government agencies now that<br>is coming along and saying we want to we<br>want to talk to you about what you're<br>doing and and see if we can support you<br>and that's another Mech mechanism by<br>which we can scale scale up too the<br>problem I think is always the government<br>agencies look for a quick return and in<br>the past they've always they they think<br>shortterm they fund shortterm and and<br>basically the outcomes a short term we<br>can't afford that any longer we have to<br>think longterm into generational and<br>we've got to have the players and the<br>commitment uh from people to be able to<br>stay the distance as well I want to say<br>that the people who work as providers<br>out in our communities and most of them<br>are not really valued and that saddens<br>me because they do work that so many<br>people wouldn't do and oftentimes it's<br>quite dangerous work and um and and we<br>need to appreciate that they are a mine<br>of information and they are now feeding<br>information into us so that we can very<br>quickly see what's trending what we need<br>to get advice to the min Minister as<br>soon as possible or where we need to um<br>collaborate more with with others up and<br>down the country so there's potential to<br>scale up and do a lot more but it does<br>require people first of all to trust<br>trust each other and you only trust<br>people that you've develop their<br>relationship with and that you're<br>prepared to actually look at things in a<br>different way and it should be led by<br>the government and thank you Maria for<br>the for the Mahi that you're doing and<br>with NOS particularly but when we're<br>talking about social investment it<br>should be led by the government because<br>the government should see the value of<br>the return that they will get and we<br>certainly know it and if they are if<br>they have difficulty with that um then<br>we'll just we'll just uh survive as an<br>Alor but we're not going to thrive and<br>we should be demanding that we Thrive<br>now we um it strikes me listening to<br>that you talked about coordination um<br>collaboration this this does seem like<br>an enormous coordination problem because<br>as I listen to you speak I'm thinking<br>about running something like the justice<br>system or the health system as we heard<br>this morning or the education system<br>they are enormous bureaucracies with all<br>of the challenges that those have and I<br>don't use bureaucracy negatively you're<br>just trying to get a lot of complex<br>stuff done how do you then coordinate<br>across those agencies because obviously<br>housing needs to connect to education to<br>health and so on Maria what what could<br>happen better in the background for the<br>coordination of those agencies so my my<br>thinking on that has evolved from uh<br>talking to thousands of Frontline<br>leadership terms um I used to think you<br>we needed to change how governments<br>organized to coordinate um but having<br>observed the the challenges of that<br>against the kind of magnetic forces of<br>bureaucracy which aren't really the<br>fault of the people in it it's just the<br>way it works I don't actually think I<br>think if we try and get government to<br>reorganize in a coordinated way um we're<br>going to be waiting a long time to get<br>the kind of results that M Pi is<br>describing um I think at the front line<br>we can coordinate so um really simple<br>Example The Loft in Christ Church um<br>they basically took 16 existing agencies<br>and service providers spread throughout<br>the city and put them in one mall and<br>put them literally right next to each<br>other Soo can come in while they're<br>doing their shopping at the mall and<br>roll through give their information once<br>and get all of the services um I know of<br>similar models for example in disability<br>which are currently struggling to be<br>funded because they're viewed as too<br>expensive but from a data perspective we<br>see the return is a lot greater than<br>forcing Faro to spend all their time<br>traveling around when they can't really<br>afford to and don't have time to because<br>they just don't engage um so I think we<br>should aim for coordination at the<br>Frontline level and I think with the<br>right incentives and support provide<br>Frontline providers whether they be<br>government agencies or not NOS can do<br>that but I think um a kind of further up<br>the chain level it's more about uh<br>taking a population based approach to<br>funding and the opportunity we have<br>there is we have government departments<br>that have a natural constituency of a<br>population that they can focus on so<br>faha for disability or the Tam going<br>through State care from through tamiki<br>um so we've got a department that has a<br>clear REM of a population then from a<br>procurement perspective they can focus<br>on how they fund coordinated Frontline<br>initiatives it doesn't require<br>reorganizing the whole government but it<br>does require saying we're going to spend<br>another $10,000 per kid um on this Hub<br>based approach that provides holistic<br>multidisiplinary care instead of the<br>status quo of it not being joined up<br>because from a population perspective we<br>can see that those kids are much more<br>likely to be able to get a Good Start in<br>the education system uh by taking that<br>approach especially the ones who fa the<br>most barriers to doing it so I think uh<br>it's about populationbased procurement<br>that incentivizes Frontline cooperation<br>which by the way a lot of NOS we meet<br>want to do but they're simply um they're<br>simply not incentivized and not funded<br>to I'm pleased that uh that the answer<br>was we first we reorganize how<br>government works and then we get into it<br>it's positive M picker yes I just wanted<br>to add that um for some reason we have<br>this unshakable belief that government<br>departments um deliver<br>quality you know I mean I can't believe<br>it in this day and age we still have<br>this unshakable belief I mean they do<br>they do okay but that's the Benchmark<br>for God's sake that's what we've settled<br>for and and it's to have a discussion<br>then we need to be able to have that<br>free and Frank discussion to say well<br>who else is out there<br>that can do better than what we've<br>currently had for the last two decades<br>and we're not really sometimes I think<br>we're just not honest enough or truthful<br>enough or we're so we to the idea that<br>the government is it that we just can't<br>get away from that and I have to say<br>that most of the MTI providers that we<br>that we um support and work alongside um<br>we say that that bench mark is too low<br>it's never really achieved and so we'll<br>have to have to set out and with govern<br>support and again I come back to the<br>government but the government should be<br>devolving itself of so much of this mahy<br>now because um the results have been<br>abysmal so I'm going to pick up on the<br>results and look back to you Michael on<br>some data questions you've been engaged<br>in um analysis and policy discussions<br>around many social interventions things<br>like harm from alcohol and so<br>on the one thing I'm thinking here so if<br>I put my black hat on I could imagine<br>this spawning an industry of competitive<br>assumption makers whereby um the group<br>that can come up with the best<br>rationalization for the largest number<br>and cell C8 in the spreadsheet gets the<br>contract because they've demonstrated<br>that it's the housing rather than the<br>education that's going to make the<br>difference what how do you navigate how<br>do you think we can navigate through<br>that such that we're making the kind of<br>impacts we want to without it<br>essentially getting tied up in<br>competitive assumption making yeah I<br>think we're always going to face that<br>risk um that uh whoever comes up with<br>the best numbers is going to get the the<br>best press they're going to get the best<br>contracts and so on but but I think the<br>way that we negotiate our way through<br>that the way that we can avoid those<br>problems or at least minimize them um is<br>through<br>transparency I think that we need to be<br>uh very transparent about the dat data<br>that we're using we need to be very<br>transparent about the methods that we're<br>employing the assumptions that we're<br>using when we're calculating something<br>like social return on investment um so<br>that others can also interrogate those<br>numbers and we can get a sense of their<br>limitations uh a sense of where um they<br>may have made faulty<br>assumptions uh where um we can I guess<br>coming back to where I started we can do<br>better we can do better not only um in<br>terms of our social spending but in<br>terms of the way that we measure in the<br>way that we evaluate and would you just<br>to double click on that would you see<br>and others may have a view on this if we<br>think about this as a as a coordination<br>and allocation challenge for for<br>government but also for other<br>organizations would you favor an agency<br>it might be treasury it might be a new<br>don't know what it's called Department<br>of Regulation uh would you favor one<br>group providing the neutral view on that<br>is it Maria's uh organization how do you<br>think about doing that and the best way<br>to to get the best outcomes I think<br>there's there's already um certainly<br>capability um treasury has some other<br>agencies have some as well um I don't<br>think that we should concentrate that<br>capability in one location in one<br>organization<br>um I think because uh social spending is<br>is spread across so many organizations<br>that there should be capability in all<br>of those organizations to some extent um<br>but again coming back to what I said<br>before if we are transparent about how<br>we are calculating things how we are<br>evaluating um then having multiple<br>organizations doing that and able to I<br>guess<br>crosscheck against uh against what<br>others are doing I think that's a that's<br>an appropriate way to move forward thank<br>you any other views yeah I think um I<br>think it makes sense to have a common<br>data infrastructure that's as accessible<br>as possible not just to agencies within<br>government but also to community<br>organizations um because there's a lot<br>of kind of um there'll be a lot of<br>commonality to the questions people are<br>asking and to the data sources they need<br>and again there's an opportunity to<br>layer analytics tools that makes it as<br>simple as possible to work with what can<br>be really unwieldy d and I have to give<br>a shout out to the stats NZ team<br>managing the integrated data<br>infrastructure the ID who I think do a<br>pretty good job of um looking for<br>opportunities to create improve the<br>infrastructure um that everyone benefits<br>from and I think it's an area government<br>has underinvested in the last few years<br>but if they can invest in it it improves<br>it for everyone um I also think it's<br>pretty critical that we have um sort of<br>neutral intermediaries uh sitting<br>between government and the community<br>sector because of the funder Fundy Rel<br>relationship we really noticed that um<br>it's much easier to get organizations to<br>create space for hard conversations when<br>they're not worried about the funer um<br>seeing that they're not doing as well on<br>something as they thought they were and<br>I also think really promising um thees<br>of organizations like Med Pickers who<br>are developing their own capability um<br>because if we can get other like e and<br>Community organizations up the DAT<br>maturity curve then they can they can do<br>the inquiry that they need for their<br>decision which will be unique to them in<br>their<br>context and agree around transparency<br>that's critical thank you um there's a<br>question here which I'm going to take<br>and then uh edit um so there's there was<br>a question and or pass this to you<br>meder around um what would we what would<br>we say to people who believe being on<br>some sort of benefit can create a<br>dependency but I'm going to pull back<br>from that and ask a more general<br>question which<br>is a around the notion of of individuals<br>Oro getting stuck you know dependent or<br>just in a situation where they cannot<br>move themselves to that situation of<br>Living Well warm home meaningful work<br>um what inter there won't be a single<br>one obviously every Situation's unique<br>what are the most promising<br>interventions activities that you have<br>seen that have helped Arno get unstuck<br>to achieve or get out of situation<br>either of dependency or just into that<br>path where they can start becoming that<br>role model if you like what's working<br>the one thing that always works is that<br>somebody will take the time to sit down<br>with them and listen and that's really<br>very simple and most times if you're<br>particularly if you work for a<br>government Department you know the clock<br>stick and get and get out and you know<br>um here you are here's a range of and<br>and it might not at all be what they<br>that they require so if we would just<br>commit to to sitting down and listening<br>and then saying as simple as what are<br>the three things that would help you the<br>most and then you get a picture that<br>it's not the housing perhaps it's that I<br>need to get to my oncology appointment<br>every second week and my eldest daughter<br>has to stay home and now the school is<br>on top of me so it's you know and if<br>nobody's sitting down and talking that's<br>just one example so I mean and that is<br>what our providers who work day by day<br>every day with Theo and they start to<br>build up a picture and then you really<br>start to get um get a sense of um the<br>overwhelming I guess you could say the<br>overwhelming environment in which that<br>family is having to cope day by day and<br>it's not easy stuff and you know it is<br>it isn't easy and while I can have a<br>crack from time to time and get very<br>impatient um with government agencies I<br>do know that if you haven't taken the<br>time there will be no trust<br>and then people just over a while after<br>a while they tend to give up and hope<br>Fades and that's the worst thing that<br>for our families to experience when hope<br>is gone they shut down their kids don't<br>go to school they don't bother if if<br>there's not enough to eat in the house<br>and that's the reality for thousands of<br>new zealanders today I'm not talking<br>hundreds I'm talking thousands thousands<br>of our children don't go to school<br>they've got parents who love them but<br>their home situation has become so<br>overwhelmed that the energy has been<br>Zapped and then the people who do come<br>to talk with them just don't have the<br>time and that's so I would say that's a<br>that's the first thing and also you need<br>somebody I believe who is with who is<br>known within that Community we always<br>say the face that is seen not the one<br>that just comes here for three months<br>and has gone the face that has seen that<br>is constantly seen um then again the<br>trusting relationship is built up but it<br>takes time takes<br>time there's a couple of investment<br>questions here one I'll start Maria but<br>Others May with you um somebody asked<br>what the panel think about the the idea<br>of opening social a social investment<br>fund or social investment more generally<br>to private investors and capital you<br>consider that and pros and cons yeah so<br>we work with a lot of um private<br>philanthropists and kind of Community<br>Based philanthropic institutions um and<br>I think there's a lot of uh there's a<br>lot of Desire there basically to improve<br>things in the community um so I think<br>you know I could see there being<br>interest in that kind of vehicle<br>particularly if it enables um sort of uh<br>more significant funding allocation like<br>I'm thinking a lot of philanthropists we<br>meet they're interested in supporting<br>Housing Solutions but they just don't<br>have the capital to play in that space<br>um um so I think from a demand<br>perspective there would be interest um<br>and then I mean from our perspective<br>we've we we kind of feel agnostic I<br>suppose as to where the funding comes<br>from um because we just know now I've<br>got a list in my head of 60 NOS that if<br>I could give them $10,000 more dollars<br>today I know they would be able to<br>change a family's life but they don't<br>have that $10,000 so I think anything<br>that can kind of crowd in capital but in<br>in a way that it can be allocated with a<br>feedback loop around it um is a good<br>thing a lot of lot of different angles<br>and questions coming in on this um I'm<br>just conscious of time I think I might<br>go to the the closing question and give<br>you a couple of minutes each with the um<br>with the magic uh governance wand<br>so much of what you say when when I<br>think the room hears you talk about<br>it makes absolute sense there's a<br>there's a strong investment case if you<br>want to look at it in a hard numbers or<br>dollars sense there's a huge ethical and<br>moral case I think there's a greater<br>long-term case and yet some of these<br>things are not happening so can you each<br>give us a couple of minutes on what you<br>what you think may be the barriers but<br>then what you would like to see so<br>you're running the ship for the next two<br>or three election Cycles what would you<br>implement across the country to<br>implement some of these changes and I'll<br>start with<br>you um I think probably the biggest<br>challenge is is political economy um and<br>I think um we have we found ourselves in<br>a situation when we have a change of<br>government that the incoming uh group<br>seems uh determined to First unwind<br>everything that the previous group had<br>done and um not everything that the<br>previous group was was was uh had put in<br>place was bad um just because you<br>disagree with it uh and I think we need<br>to be a little bit more<br>um I guess concede a little bit to the<br>other side um that some things are good<br>and and should be retained but in order<br>to do that we need to actually be<br>evaluated we need to know which things<br>are working um so that we can keep the<br>things that are working we need to not<br>be afraid to get rid of the things that<br>are not working work um and uh through<br>better I think the um the mindset needs<br>to change the mindset of um people who<br>are in leadership positions and this is<br>this isn't just the government it's it's<br>everybody having a look to see what can<br>their contribution be to moving<br>significant numbers of new zealanders to<br>a better place so the mindset has to has<br>to change um we do have to see the<br>potential in people you know we do have<br>to um as I said before this business<br>about the a team and the B team and<br>thinking that there'll always be numbers<br>back up on the sideline what we don't<br>ever talk about is the true cost to<br>Alora when we leave thousands of people<br>parked up on the sideline to say well<br>you know they'll they'll get by but<br>there is a significant cost to New<br>Zealand but it's the mind has to change<br>and um and I do believe that there can<br>be private sector involvement I really<br>do I think there's some great leaders in<br>the private sector who if they were only<br>asked but we never asked them because we<br>think well what would they want well<br>they want what most of us want fantastic<br>country so that would be something that<br>I'd like to<br>see thank you Maria um I think for me I<br>think um I think of it like there's a<br>micro level and a macro level at the<br>micro level we shouldn't<br>underestimate how much um is possible by<br>simply enabling Frontline organizations<br>to do an incrementally better job over<br>time um so I think that's the barrier<br>there is uh Frontline organizations of<br>all sizes being able to access the kind<br>of analytics toolkit that helps them<br>understand where their Investments going<br>who they're reaching the difference<br>they're already making and so where<br>there might be opportunities to do even<br>more and to bring those business cases<br>to their funders the business case to<br>invest the 100 Grand in marketing to<br>reach 30% more kids with mental health<br>issues which is an example we saw last<br>week so I think just making the tools<br>available at the front line is critical<br>um we're seeing big uptake of these<br>tools by the larger NGS who can afford<br>it but we need funders to come to the<br>party to enable access to the smaller<br>ones and that means shifting our Focus<br>from being<br>you know Project funding to actually<br>flexible funding that organizations can<br>spend on their it and analytics<br>capability so that's what I'd say at the<br>micro level at the macro level um I<br>think it's kind of Step One is use the<br>information that we already have and as<br>I said I think the agencies that have a<br>natural population that they exist for<br>and can focus on can the toolkit sitting<br>there now um for them to use and I know<br>in parts of government it is being<br>picked up um um so use that to better<br>understand your customers the people<br>that you're trying to make a difference<br>for and where your current spending is<br>going in relation to that I think back<br>to I think one of the early social<br>investment exercises um way before my<br>time in government where they they<br>unpacked that MSD welfare liability and<br>they found this group of people who were<br>some of the longest term um kind of<br>welfare recipients which was single men<br>with um schizophrenia and other major<br>mental health conditions living alone in<br>places like boarding houses and<br>shockingly shockingly what they found<br>was that group were receiving almost no<br>government services so one of the most<br>in need groups uh receiving almost no<br>investment uh in support uh to improve<br>their lives other than the acute end of<br>hospital so so I think using what you<br>already have to understand your<br>population and identify where those gaps<br>and needs are would be an amazing<br>starting point because what we're<br>learning is once the information's there<br>and we're looking at it um it creat it's<br>kind of a catalyst for change because it<br>raises the next 10 questions like who<br>are these guys where are they who has a<br>relationship of trust with them can we<br>go and ask them what it is that they<br>need what kind of services should they<br>be should we be giving them access to<br>and why can't they access them we've got<br>to get on that line of inquiry um and<br>fortunately we have amazing policy<br>people in New Zealand who have the<br>capability to do that and now they have<br>the to it so let's do<br>it great close all right look we are at<br>time um this has been a fascinating uh<br>discussion I think we're all a little<br>bit wiser now which is part of the goal<br>of being here so I ask you to put your<br>hands together for our fantastic<br>panel Co thank you all thank<br>you<br>all right and T welcome Jim arrived for<br>the coffee uh that was a fantastic<br>discussion we are going to go into a<br>short break now for about 20 minutes<br>until 3:00 just previewing after that uh<br>next session will be at 3 back here on<br>trade dealing with the divided world uh<br>Professor Anna strut will lead that<br>we'll go straight into that from the<br>last session of the day around monetary<br>policy uh which Steven Joyce will be<br>leading and of course that precedes our<br>discussion or presentation from Reserve<br>Bank Governor Adrian a which is over<br>breakfast tomorrow so that's a double<br>double header if you're into monetary<br>policy um and a reminder of course uh<br>we'll wrap up after 5 and and join<br>people for a drink so uh break now for<br>about 20 minutes and if we can all be<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
