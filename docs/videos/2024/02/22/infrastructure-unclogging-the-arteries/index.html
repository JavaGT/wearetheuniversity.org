accurate.</p><p>to<br>well we've got a a fast moving uh set of<br>sessions here and what we're doing now<br>is we're moving directly on to our next<br>panel which is focusing on<br>infrastructure unclogging knee arteries<br>we've got an amazing lineup of three<br>CEOs in front of us that are going to be<br>able to bring us uh lots of insights and<br>knowledge from their their very<br>significant experience across a range of<br>areas um in the order in which they'll<br>present their opening addresses we've<br>got nick leot uh chief chief executive<br>of infrastructure New Zealand uh we've<br>got Allison Andrew sorry we moved the<br>order around a bit but let's uh we can<br>we can go in this order Allison Andrew<br>is the Chief Executive Officer of trans<br>power and uh we've got Chris joblin who<br>is the CEO of tine group Holdings um so<br>let's turn straight to you Nick for your<br>opening<br>remarks<br>a warning that some of the themes that I<br>discuss follow on very nicely from the<br>previous session and there are a hundred<br>messages that I could deliver from those<br>whose lives are consumed with the<br>building of quality sustainable and<br>enduring public infrastructure those of<br>us concerned with that outcome about 5<br>million of us um will have many<br>different different desires and<br>aspirations that we want to see reliable<br>and safe connections from school to work<br>to home protection against extreme<br>weather and earthquakes in communities<br>decent place to live great educational<br>space for children to learn in quality<br>and sustainable energy and digital<br>connectivity the list could be<br>endless and while we've still got a lot<br>to celebrate in this country there is<br>the sinking feeling that in many areas<br>we've slipped behind that massive<br>socioeconomic gaps haven't been closed<br>that stuff doesn't quite work as well as<br>it used to be at a train track on a hot<br>day a poth hold Road or a hospital<br>building that's well pasted its used by<br>date we've grown quite quickly and our<br>investment hasn't met demand we haven't<br>replaced or renewed our networked assets<br>at a rate that will sustain our<br>environment and sometimes even our<br>public health and finally we just<br>haven't nailed that major requirement<br>around actually delivering major<br>projects and doing that well one survey<br>and this is worldwide of 3,000<br>infrastructure projects found that only<br>27% were delivered on budget um 3% on<br>budget and time and only. 2% on budget<br>on time and of the quality expected so<br>New Zealand isn't alone in that<br>challenge we talked we just heard we've<br>got an infrastructure deficit of about<br>estimated $200 billion we need to invest<br>according to the infrastructure<br>commission $30 billion a year every year<br>for the next 30 Years to renew what<br>we've got and build what we need and my<br>sense is we know what we need to<br>do um but that we must understand why<br>we've got so bad at just getting stuff<br>built there's also that more compelling<br>question to pose first and we heard that<br>as well just before where are we going<br>and why what are the compelling aspects<br>of our nationhood that should be<br>enhanced we lack a bit of a national<br>vision for this country an<br>infrastructure is a major means to get<br>where we need to go and it will take us<br>there if it's done right in the right<br>time frames it can help deliver a<br>fulfilling and healthy life by produ by<br>building a more productive sustainable<br>country Economist uh Paul Krugman<br>famously said productivity isn't<br>everything but it almost is and I'd like<br>to paraphrase that by saying in a New<br>Zealand context infrastructure isn't<br>everything but it almost is social<br>polarization in a 24-hour news cycle has<br>forced reactive immediacy from our<br>leaders the opportunity for Clear<br>thought and long-term aspiration which<br>then should be followed by wealth<br>formulated evidence-based detailed<br>policy now appears to elude us much of<br>the time and I understand Helen Clark<br>said last night that we govern in<br>three-year terms not for the long term<br>we must change that think slow Act Fast<br>I've been reminded of this over the last<br>week as the infrastructure New Zealand<br>team has evaluated the great work of the<br>public and private sectors on Fast<br>tracking a bridge and Road restoration<br>not too far from here there was space to<br>think and plan properly at the start and<br>once that was done the project could<br>move at lightning speed so it was early<br>and at budget and unfortunately it<br>appears I think to most new zealanders<br>that this is by far in a way the<br>exception when we build<br>infrastructure we can do it on a<br>relatively small project where urgency<br>is required but we need to make it the<br>new New Zealand way of doing things that<br>takes a change of mindset and so the<br>challenge for this government and his<br>successors will will be to walk and chew<br>gum at the same time yes build those<br>important projects that you've promised<br>we need them but your legacy should be<br>also about setting that unified<br>Direction about what the future looks<br>like that we can buy<br>into and um also be coupled with<br>delivery reality the structural changes<br>needed in the system requiring an<br>upscaled and upskilled public service<br>and partnership with an enhanced private<br>infrastructure sector to be able to work<br>together to ensure<br>and build to an ongoing pipeline of<br>properly assessed projects that build<br>our economic and social Prosperity<br>you Teno Cur great to be with you here<br>today in the white cutle thank you to um<br>white cut business school I thought I'd<br>just tell you a little bit about trans<br>power for those of you who don't know<br>you own us so um I'll tell you a bit<br>about what you own we uh State<br>Enterprise we're the owner and operator<br>of a critical piece of infrastructure<br>the national electricity grid and the<br>Grid's built a bit like the motorway we<br>own the main Motorway that spans from<br>Bluff in the south kaoi in the north and<br>we take power from the electricity<br>generators and move it to the<br>distribution companies like well<br>networks here in the white cutle that<br>then distributes to homes and<br>businesses we have around5 billion of<br>assets 174 substations 25,000<br>transmission towers more than 11,000<br>kilometers of lines and the hvdc high<br>voltage direct current Network that<br>links the North and South<br>Ireland we have another really critical<br>role two roles the second role is as the<br>system operator so we run the<br>electricity Market in real time<br>247365 matching supply and demand and<br>maintaining power quality so at anytime<br>you can turn the lights on with<br>confidence and know that you can<br>increase your demand and it will be<br>quietly meat behind the light<br>switch to give you confidence the<br>electricity infrastructure is in pretty<br>good health particularly compared to<br>other infrastructure so we have our<br>Assets in a good State and they're<br>providing a good quality<br>service but the National Grid is coming<br>to the end of its life in a large part<br>part of our Network because it was built<br>in the 50s and 60s done a lot of work to<br>build refurbish maintain but at the end<br>of the um extending your asset life you<br>need to replace it so we have quite a<br>big Capital program to replace our<br>assets over the next 10 to 15<br>years and we've planned for that in our<br>next regulatory control period we are<br>regulated by the Commerce Commission<br>under price quality regulation we put<br>forward every five years an application<br>for funding for Capital and for<br>operating cost for a 5year period and<br>they assess US versus quality standards<br>meeting metrics and say yes you can<br>recover this amount of money um from<br>customers to deliver that service so<br>we've applied for a 32% increase in<br>capital for that period 25 to 2030 to<br>make sure we maintain the Grid in good<br>health so we don't make sure that we<br>make sure that the system is in good<br>health that won't unclog the archeries<br>New Zealand's made government's made a<br>range of climate commitments um and we<br>have a once in a lifetime opportunity to<br>decarbonize our economy and that will be<br>largely through<br>electrification and why because we are<br>so well endowed as a country with a<br>highly Renewable Power System we're<br>running at over 90% Renewable Power but<br>our overall economy is only about 30 to<br>40% renewable on an energy basis so we<br>have a fantastic opportunity to take<br>carbon out of our hydrocarbons out of<br>our vehicle Fleet and the hydrocarbons<br>out of process<br>heat the cost to do that won't be<br>insignificant but the cost if we don't<br>do it will be significant not just to<br>the um climate but also to the<br>opportunities we have ahead of us to New<br>Zealand I talked about how our highly<br>renewable system is there and we've got<br>a lot of inquiries and people who want<br>to build new Renewables we also have<br>great resources for new wind and new<br>solar but we also need now to work out<br>how we take the carbon as I say out of<br>the demand side that's transport process<br>heat we've estimated we're going to need<br>about 22 gaw of new generation connected<br>to the grid by 2050 and just put that in<br>context you say what's a GW well current<br>installed capacity is 10 so it's more<br>than doubling our capacity that's<br>installed out to<br>2050 um we also so what we need to do is<br>transfer as a few things we need to make<br>sure we can connect everybody up who<br>wants to connect to the grid so<br>connections to the motorway both load<br>and New Generation then we have to make<br>sure that our main system is unblocked<br>so people can move their electrons<br>around freely and that in itself is<br>quite a challenge to plan those<br>constraints and when we need to move<br>them we have a $400 million Capital<br>approval that's just been um tentatively<br>approved by the commer commission for<br>$400 million that will unblock the<br>remaining capacity in that main grid<br>backbone the next step is going to be<br>building new lines and we going to need<br>a larger grid backbone with more<br>interconnections and also the local<br>lines companies are going to have to<br>make a significant investment to unblock<br>their networks and their system<br>for all this new distributed generation<br>and more demand that it's going to come<br>into the<br>system electrification is going to bring<br>great OPP challenges and also<br>opportunities first of all in terms of<br>managing the transition we have to try<br>and get you excited about the<br>opportunity um electrification most<br>people's eyes glaze when we talk about<br>it but actually it is a wonderful<br>opportunity for us to<br>decarbonize but in terms of managing the<br>transmission transition we have to think<br>about fairness and Equity it's all very<br>well if we can all afford an electric<br>vehicle but if you can't how do we help<br>people make that<br>transition how do we make sure that<br>electricity stays affordable and the way<br>we cost that and charge back from<br>consumers is fair and<br>Equitable we've got some challenges<br>around our social license to use a glob<br>phase there's no transition without<br>transmission how many of you are very<br>excited about hosting a high voltage<br>large transmission tower in your<br>backyard with conductors running over<br>the top probably won't be in your<br>backyard but we need to recognize we're<br>going to need more land for solar more<br>land for wind and more land for<br>transmission lines in order to take<br>carbon out of our economy to decarbonize<br>we're going to need to do that but we<br>need to get that social license to get<br>new zealanders willing to do that other<br>countries talk about bananas build<br>absolutely no assets anywhere near<br>anybody that's quite challenging when<br>you're running and planning a power<br>system um further challenges are around<br>Workforce with that massive build we<br>estimate that for our service providers<br>who do all the work in our field<br>maintaining break fixing and building<br>we're going to need to double our<br>Workforce and these are highly skilled<br>people apprentices line mechanics<br>substation maintainers and that trans<br>power we're going to need to add at<br>least two to 300 more Professional<br>Engineers to do this work they're not<br>just sitting around waiting for for us<br>to employ them and the world is<br>decarbonizing so the demand for these<br>people and these skills is enormous<br>heard a lot of conversation I've only<br>been here this morning unfortunately but<br>a lot about New Zealand we are not an<br>isolated economy we are losing people to<br>Australia I worry about our<br>competitiveness for our young people how<br>do we make sure we have those jobs and<br>that environment that our brightest and<br>young want to live and work and<br>contribute here one final thing small<br>technical challenge as we are building<br>this new exciting future it's going to<br>be a hell of a challenge as a system<br>operator balancing the system as we add<br>a whole lot more renewable intermittent<br>generation how are we going to firm that<br>up how are we going to make sure when<br>you turn the light switch on without Bas<br>load thermal or peeking thermal plant<br>behind we can be sure we have can keep<br>those lights on so lots of challenges<br>lots of opportunities thank<br>you<br>Koto um thanks Matt University for the<br>opportunity to speak and share a few<br>thoughts this morning um I think the<br>title in the subject is something that's<br>dear to my heart uh infrastructure<br>something really passionate about and<br>when we think about the title of this<br>session unclogging the unclogging the<br>arteries you it does seem to to me like<br>our infrastructure networks have been<br>you know smoking a couple of packs a day<br>since the 70s and you know we're in more<br>need of probably a a double or a triple<br>bypass rather than the odd spent to to<br>to get things moving because we just<br>haven't invested and and that is<br>creating real critical issues for us and<br>and there's a b wave of of challenge you<br>know that we're going to need to meet so<br>I lead organization ton group Holdings<br>you know we we've been trying to make<br>some material changes and investments in<br>infrastructure uh the biggest one being<br>the rura superhub um which is just sort<br>of over<br>here um and and that's really looking to<br>unblock some of the supply chain<br>challenges and how we connect New<br>Zealand to the rest of the world and and<br>move Freight not only within our country<br>but connecting to the rest of the world<br>and and going in a way that is um more<br>climate friendly than just Trucking<br>everything and trucks and moving around<br>one of the steps that I like to use<br>around Freight is when you look at a<br>truck carrying a container on the road<br>40% of those have got nothing in them<br>you know we are just hugely<br>inefficient um so rura it's 490 hectares<br>and we're developing that over time and<br>really this morning just wanted to share<br>a a few lessons and key points from our<br>17-year overnight success at<br>rura um and the challenges of bringing<br>something like that to beer um and<br>following on from Nick one of the things<br>that I think that is sadly lacking in<br>New Zealand is vision and confidence um<br>around<br>infrastructure and I'll touch on on a<br>few of those thoughts as well so from a<br>tgh point of view when we um come up<br>with the Bold idea to have<br>Port uh and Logistics Hub here in<br>Hamilton um you know some people thought<br>we were crazy um and we had no idea that<br>it would take 17 years to get to the<br>start line you know through multiple you<br>know challenges through through planning<br>courts you know dealing with councils<br>dealing with<br>residents you know 17 years to get to<br>the start line for something that when<br>you you look at it now is is just really<br>obvious<br>um and one of the things that is enabled<br>to be delivered is that strength of the<br>vision you know we always knew was the<br>right thing to do the right location and<br>and was something that was not only<br>important uh for us for for our owners<br>what could a tiny um but also important<br>for the region and important for the<br>country as a whole so that or Vision you<br>enables you to carry something like this<br>through um and could have certainly<br>wasn't a case of build it and they will<br>come you know one of the challenges you<br>know from uh an economic point of view<br>and growing<br>productivity is you've got this gap<br>between you know getting something to<br>the start line and getting something<br>that people can see in touch to get<br>people to commit and to to make those<br>changes and yeah we're we're very um<br>Lucky in in terms of um our development<br>that we've got great Partners you know<br>not only with the the the regional<br>authorities but also with our tenants<br>and Kart M you know Peter Baker<br>transport Big<br>Chill uh and Port of tar and and others<br>to<br>come so said Catch 22 you know you have<br>the<br>opportunity but that initial hump to get<br>to the start line is horrific so using r<br>as an example just to put the roads and<br>a bit of water and and and so on in yeah<br>it's well over $100 million and you have<br>to front load and spend that money just<br>to get to the start line and that<br>challenge is huge and unless you have<br>that force of character obviously have a<br>a big balance sheet very few people and<br>businesses can actually take that that<br>challenge<br>on um but when you get there you know<br>then everyone celebrates that success<br>um so the the way that we overcame you<br>know those challenges is through the pgf<br>and the sh shovel rooting process we had<br>some seed money from the government to<br>fund the roading Network and that was<br>the bit that just enabled us to really<br>get going um it wasn't<br>huge um but was vitally important for us<br>to to get going and what that meant was<br>you know we had the bulldozers and the<br>and the trucks ready to go so once you<br>know we had that commitment and that<br>confidence we could keep going um and if<br>you think about R of you know one of the<br>critical things you know that that<br>happens<br>is you know we built that based on the<br>experence Expressway and that<br>intersection of you know East Coast main<br>trun line and and the wler expressway so<br>once you know you you start signaling<br>big<br>infrastructure you<br>know industry business will get behind<br>and they will invest and they will make<br>decisions that means that not<br>only um does that create you know<br>Prosperity you know it it creates<br>opportunity but it also takes some of<br>the the pain away from you know the the<br>government in terms of delivering some<br>of these<br>things<br>um so for me you know it's not all about<br>what we're trying to get away from which<br>is broken pipes broken roads<br>potholes um and and a massive<br>infrastructure deficit you know we need<br>to have the ability to clearly<br>articulate what's needed where we're<br>going and what does our future look like<br>uh another question and and thing that<br>we see a lot is that when we look to<br>deliver infrastructure we're seeking<br>Perfection and when we seek Perfection<br>we end up with<br>procrastination and when we look to<br>deliver infrastructure in New Zealand<br>what quite often happens is we're trying<br>to solve a whole bunch of<br>dispar um uh needs and what that means<br>is that projects that should be<br>relatively simple become bigger than<br>being here and then the costs blow out<br>and then we go oh this is too high and<br>the can just gets pushed down the road<br>for future<br>Generations um so getting infrastructure<br>done requires a real force of character<br>and it requires<br>leadership you know we need to be able<br>to articulate what we're going to do why<br>we're going to do it and when we're<br>going to do<br>it um and if we can articulate that<br>Vision you know people will get behind<br>it I mean the in the in the previous<br>session the question was raised around<br>tax cuts if we can articulate to the<br>taxpayer hey we're not going to give you<br>tax cuts but we're going to give you<br>this infrastructure that's going to make<br>your life better most people will get<br>behind that and accept that and and<br>willing to make those Investments that<br>are going to make their lives better on<br>a day-to-day<br>basis um and I think from a government<br>point of view you know we've got a bunch<br>of you know you know bodies that are<br>trying to provide that leadership but it<br>must come from government uh and they<br>have to put a stake in the ground around<br>some of the big decisions you an obvious<br>one that's pretty close to us is future<br>ports we've had I don't know how many<br>future Port studies but everyone knows<br>the port has to go into the fth of TS so<br>why don't we just say that why we we say<br>this is where it's going to go and it's<br>going to happen in in our<br>lifetimes uh and actually just get on<br>with<br>it so looking ahead um you know we need<br>to make the right decisions uh around<br>the types of infrastructure that we<br>invest in and we need to be clear around<br>what we're trying to achieve and as I<br>said earlier we can't solve all things<br>for all people with one project we need<br>to be clear about what we're trying to<br>achieve and and go for it<br>um one of the things that that I think<br>is quite interesting and and and<br>probably the point that I'll leave you<br>this morning is technology is changing<br>and that is going to have a significant<br>impact on<br>infrastructure so you look at the rise<br>of AI augmented reality virtual reality<br>um that is going to completely change<br>the way that we live and work um and<br>that is coming very very<br>quickly and that means that we're going<br>to to need a whole lot more<br>infrastructure uh in order to be able to<br>take advantage of that and if we don't<br>we're going to be left behind uh and<br>that's going to be critical so if you<br>look at for example you know Melbourne<br>and Sydney I think Melbourne's got seven<br>data centers that have been built in<br>another 200 under construction syy<br>similar how many have we got in New<br>Zealand you know those are cities that<br>are you know approximate to the economy<br>of New Zealand we need to be doing more<br>of this and planning it you and actually<br>getting ah<br>H um because<br>AI is just going to transform the way<br>that we live and work and it's going to<br>require a significant amount of<br>infrastructure uh and the last thing<br>that we want to be doing is relying on<br>capacity and infrastructure that's in<br>the US or Singapore or on the eastern<br>sea board of<br>Australia um and that you know exposes<br>us to geopolitical risks and and a whole<br>bunch of other things that we don't<br>necessarily want to be exposed of uh<br>exposed<br>to and obviously data centers you know<br>one of the critical things with that is<br>electricity yeah and you know you think<br>about you know the 22 I think it was gws<br>of electricity that we need um we have<br>the tools to to be able to create<br>climate FR uh climate friend friendly<br>energy you know we have a wonderful<br>natural endowment you know that means<br>that we could be 100% renewable<br>energy but do we actually have the<br>willpower to do the things that we need<br>to do whether it be another Hydro scheme<br>or or or things that you know we could<br>easily do um but probably won't and<br>that's where the vision you know is<br>really important for our country that we<br>start making the steps forwards that are<br>going to enable us us deliver a bright<br>and prosperous future um because if we<br>don't you know where we're going as our<br>standard of living is as rapidly<br>declining and you<br>know uh the generation below me many of<br>them are not going to call New Zealand<br>their home unless we make the<br>Investments that we need to make now and<br>and that's a critical thing that we do<br>that we need to do because if we don't<br>um as our stand of living declines our<br>children uh will go out to the rest of<br>the world to find those high standards<br>of living so we need vision and we need<br>to make that Vision a reality and make<br>the Investments and have the force of<br>character uh to do the things that may<br>not be popular but un necessary thank<br>you well thank you very much there were<br>clear links with the previous panel and<br>with panels over the last few days and<br>of course with the next uh panel<br>particularly your comments Allison on<br>the uh emissions and so forth which will<br>be picked up in our our next panel lots<br>and lots of questions coming through<br>where I'd like to start though is with<br>this issue of how do we balance spending<br>on new infrastructure with spending on<br>maintenance of existing<br>infrastructure and a side question could<br>the panel comment on wasteful spending<br>on infrastructure in New Zealand<br>would you like to start on on this one<br>Nick yes I think uh it's really<br>important that we<br>Define what our deficit looks like in<br>terms of quite quickly in terms of what<br>we need to spend on<br>renewals what what hasn't been spent on<br>renewals and what needs to be invested<br>there is an opportunity I think to group<br>some of that work together into sort of<br>larger projects to make that those you<br>know infrastructure projects worthwhile<br>completing you know and internationally<br>in themselves but for water for three<br>water infrastructure we're thinking<br>there are some various figures but it's<br>between 80 And1 1880 billion dollar um<br>that is massive whichever end that that<br>is uh for roading uh it's clearly in the<br>billions and for rail also um if we look<br>at the impact of on both the Wellington<br>and Oakland passenger rail uh networks<br>um because of poor renewals over many a<br>long period of time those are those are<br>really significant so I think it's quite<br>it is quite important to to assess<br>it uh focus on uh a quite a fast move uh<br>renewal um and then think about those<br>Capital those major projects that New<br>Zealand still needs so that's yeah and<br>of course water and many of these other<br>areas of infrastructure things that you<br>know quite quite a lot about but um<br>um you know these billions that you're<br>talking about that's for the rebuild but<br>to what extent how do how do we how do<br>we you can't build a new extension on<br>your house if your foundations are going<br>to fall over that's just nutty so we<br>have to grip up and look at our<br>infrastructure deficit for poorly<br>maintained Assets in the past and I<br>think accept the fact that asset<br>management is a discipline it requires<br>professional people who are really<br>skilled it might be really really boring<br>but you do asset health condition<br>assessment risk criticality these take<br>very sophisticated skills we've spent<br>years building a foundation to really<br>understand our assets criticality risk<br>condition and intervene appropriately<br>because if you do good life extension<br>you can manage and get better cost<br>tradeoffs but this is boring stuff but<br>it's so essential so don't go and build<br>your skyscraper on a foundation that's<br>going to fall over because that's going<br>to be stupid we have to work out what<br>the deficit is and I'm pleased to say in<br>electricity just now grace of God we've<br>been well funded it's in reasonable<br>Health not withstanding we have to<br>refurbish but you look at our roads we'<br>not been investing enough in maintaining<br>we've been building shiny new stuff if<br>you don't invest in what's there the<br>cost to catch it later is so much more<br>than the cost of maintaining it well as<br>you go so yes we all want shiny new<br>things but we have to bite the reality<br>and fix and maintain and fund for the<br>long term what we've got if you want to<br>maintain it or else turn it off but I<br>just think all this new money going into<br>shiny things before you're investing yes<br>you have to do it well yes you have to<br>make sure you've got but it also<br>requires capability balance sheets scale<br>competency it systems this is not going<br>to come from doing it in a really<br>fragmented way this is about big<br>infrastructure we need capable big<br>skills big balance sheet need to<br>maintain this and it's certainly not<br>boring when it goes wrong isn't it we<br>we've all experienced it we'll go back<br>to ni it's just a question really I mean<br>those those things are all I I<br>completely agree but Allison the<br>one ingredient that I think is missing<br>uh that I'd like you to comment on you<br>work in a very regulated sector I'd like<br>you to just talk to the impact of good<br>regulation um on your ability to do all<br>those things and to really be focused on<br>investing in those systems as well as<br>the actual asset renewal yeah um I laugh<br>because being regulated is a pain as<br>well as a<br>blessing um we are regulated by the<br>Commerce Commission as I say for how big<br>our pie is and a fiveyear period and<br>then the electricity Authority decides<br>what portion of this Delicious Pie you<br>all get to eat and you're all on diets<br>so there's two different um debates we<br>have but it Nick to answer your question<br>it is<br>in the long term it helps us because we<br>have funding certainty we have to<br>satisfy um the Commerce Commission as<br>our regulator that we uh prudently need<br>to spend um that amount of money and we<br>go through a rigorous per uh period of<br>about a 9month assessment with an<br>independent verifier which is an<br>engineering and economics consultant<br>that comes in and pours over our books<br>we make regulatory applications about<br>this High won't be paper these days but<br>it's a very very detailed process where<br>they can assure you that we are<br>following good engineering industry<br>practice the amount of money we need to<br>spend we will continue to deliver a<br>quality service that these quality<br>measures these asset Health measures so<br>it is if people who love economics<br>economic pricing theory is very exciting<br>and very detailed um trying to<br>approximate markets but it does work for<br>us and I think things like longli assets<br>like us like a lot of countries around<br>the world have the same kind of<br>regulation for water<br>very similar assets because it's having<br>that ability to fund in the long term to<br>do the maintenance and to be able to<br>maintain the assets so yes although<br>regulation can be painful it<br>works and it is a good check and balance<br>yes thanks CH do you want to add yeah<br>for for me just going back to the first<br>question we have to have a clear Road<br>mapap of what's needed and how we're<br>going to do it and it is that balancing<br>between you know new infrastructure and<br>and and fixing what we've got but<br>also there's no point putting money into<br>Old assets if they're not going to take<br>you to where you're going to where you<br>need to be I think you know in terms of<br>Regulation you know I think for some of<br>our infrastructure assets particularly<br>water I think you know we could be much<br>better served um and also I<br>think the the way that we own<br>infrastructure and and the fact that<br>it's dis disaggregated you does a the<br>mive disservice and one of the critical<br>things that we're going to need in order<br>to solve the infrastructure deficit is a<br>lot of capital and that Capital clearly<br>can't come from the taxpayer Alan and<br>that means that we're going to need to<br>bring in private<br>investment and at scale in order to<br>basically get to where we need to<br>be can I build on what Chris has just<br>said I think the other thing I'd really<br>advocate for this holistic view of<br>infrastructure<br>it's is one thing Cyclone Gabrielle<br>really taught us it's the criticality of<br>all infrastructure Services coming<br>together I'm sure you'll all recall we<br>had a substation underwater but what was<br>critical for us in restoring services to<br>the Haws Bay and and gisburn area was<br>water roading Telco power it all had to<br>come together so I think it's a country<br>where you also have to start to do some<br>of this long-term planning and make<br>tradeoffs how much of our transportation<br>do we want VIA Rail via Road via<br>shipping so you can't think about ports<br>in isolation from our kiwi rail<br>discussions from our um W ta discussions<br>we need to think about infrastructure<br>and its totality and work out also what<br>we need but also what can we afford and<br>how are we going to pay for it yeah you<br>take the that Port piece you know you<br>move the 16 Port studies I think by the<br>way there'll probably be a few more<br>before anything gets done as well um but<br>you you look at the Port situation you<br>move the port out of Downtown Oakland<br>that is going to have a massive impact<br>on what we need to spend on roading you<br>know freeing up you know Downtown<br>Oakland the the southern Motorway Etc<br>you know so decisions that we make like<br>that can have profound impacts on other<br>parts of our infrastructure Network and<br>I think you're right Alison you have to<br>look at it in totality and the decisions<br>that we can make in one place can<br>actually have a profound impact<br>elsewhere um and unless you're looking<br>at that h of network um you know again<br>we'll make mistakes I'm going to change<br>us into a slightly different Tech here<br>but very much related we've got some of<br>our school students who are joining uh<br>this and they they've asked a specific<br>question they've been playing uh paying<br>careful attention to the demography<br>session that we had yesterday and<br>they're asking how is New Zealand<br>planning its infrastructure to cope with<br>the changing demographics that we are<br>going to see in coming decades so how is<br>New Zealand planning to adapt its<br>infrastructure to deal with these<br>demographic<br>changes do you like to start or in terms<br>of how we build it or how we or are we<br>how are we doing it I guess the students<br>would like some reassurance are we<br>thinking about uh these demographic<br>changes do we have the systems and so on<br>in place that are going to deal with<br>with the world that they're going<br>toer I think uh it's quite an exposing<br>question um and I I think Chris was<br>beginning to touch on it around our<br>place in the world what is the what do<br>New Zealand offer the world and what do<br>the world offer New Zealand but are we<br>what are the digital connections and are<br>we thinking ahead and it's difficult to<br>predict and things that but things are<br>moving so quickly think about artificial<br>intelligence how way we produce the way<br>we build infrastructure the kind of<br>skills that we need are different and I<br>don't I don't feel I think that's part<br>of that Vision thing um as well is we we<br>haven't scoped that well enough we're<br>thinking about building back base assets<br>which are really in renewing but which<br>is really important but in terms of<br>anticipating that future and if you<br>think about the need for uh carbon<br>neutrality we're sort of beginning to<br>get a handle on that<br>but the needs of a population and a<br>Workforce in 30 to 50 years are much<br>harder to consider and that has to be<br>part of the consideration and the<br>leadership that's needed to develop a<br>vision I think it's a great question I<br>had didn't wasn't unfortunately wasn't<br>here yesterday but I have had the<br>benefit of hearing um Paul spoonley<br>before and it's quite confronting and um<br>scary thinking about what future<br>demographics May mean to our country um<br>so we think a lot about that we think a<br>lot about new technology we think a lot<br>about you know will people still need<br>our eets in the future we build things<br>that should last for 50 60 years and if<br>you refurbish them forever so you got to<br>make sure you put them in the right<br>place at the right size and all those<br>good things which are kind of hard to to<br>estimate looking out if I can perhaps<br>maybe get it wrong from yesterday but<br>what I I heard because we had Paul<br>spoony come to talk to our leadership<br>team um around what what might that mean<br>for a grid of the future a power system<br>of the future we do know that we're<br>going to have a lot more distributed<br>generation people are still going to<br>want to use electricity we're going to<br>need to decarbonize it's going to be the<br>the fuel of the future we're going to<br>have much bigger population further in<br>the north you know more more in Oakland<br>different types around the country we're<br>still going to have big Hydro stations<br>that are fantastic buildt a long time<br>deep in the South probably still going<br>to need that move to lots of big Power<br>going still down that main Motorway um<br>to where the load is Big challenges with<br>how you run a power system with<br>generation far away from load more<br>distributed stuff so yes we do just to<br>give some confidence we do think a lot<br>about that in thinking about what might<br>people want to do with electricity in<br>the future and how might we best serve<br>that whether it's from distribution<br>whether it's from whatever um but it's a<br>really good challenge and I'm going to<br>take this into technology which of<br>course chish you were talking about uh<br>in in your intro remarks as well um you<br>know technology may change the things<br>that we need uh when I was in San<br>Francisco earlier in a year year I went<br>to my first completely self-drive taxi<br>it's it's quite disconcerting when that<br>wheel turns itself around the corner um<br>I also was at West lafet which is not<br>what you think of as a center of<br>technology in the US and there was a<br>robot delivering pizzas along pedu<br>University Streets so I guess we've got<br>changes in technology that are going to<br>change perhaps the sort of<br>infrastructure that we need to support<br>our lives but we've also got this issue<br>that technology is changing and giving<br>us different options<br>now some of the ways in which both of<br>those are going to play out we don't<br>know about so it's really difficult to<br>to foresee the future but I wonder if if<br>the three of you would care to speak to<br>to either one or both of those issues<br>about how technology is changing what we<br>need from our infrastructure and how<br>it's changing or is likely to change the<br>way in which we Supply yeah I think<br>going back to the previous question I<br>think technology is going to be a much<br>bigger driver that we need to be<br>thinking about than than demographics or<br>be in this region you Hamilton's going<br>to be a city of half a million people<br>before long and we need to be planning<br>for that but from a technology point of<br>view how I'd liken it is<br>AI is is going to be the equivalent to<br>to the way that we live and work to you<br>know the first computers or the mobile<br>phone that is the scale of the change<br>that is coming and as we know the pace<br>of<br>when the when these big um disruptive<br>events happen are quicker and<br>quicker so I think you know firstly we<br>need to have that digital technology you<br>know and the infrastructure it means the<br>way that we build Design Homes is going<br>to be different um I think yeah it's<br>definitely going to have an impact on on<br>roading um as you say you know in the US<br>already that last mile delivery is is<br>increasingly being done by robots you<br>know that that are Roll Along the foot<br>path um so you know that's just where<br>it's coming and I think as a country we<br>need to actually get out and and look at<br>the rest of the world because we yeah<br>what's happening in in America as things<br>that we think is probably Dreamland as<br>as reality there and those things are<br>just slowly starting to come to<br>Australia you know sort of five years<br>behind and then we're going to be 5 to<br>10 years behind them we actually have to<br>make the investment to know what's<br>coming so that we can make the right<br>decisions and and within our business<br>that's something that we have made a<br>real effort to do to go out to the rest<br>of the world to understand you know what<br>is coming so that we can make really<br>good decisions yeah and they're not<br>going to be perfect because we can't<br>forcast the future but at least having<br>that awareness and and those insights<br>did you want to make any comments well<br>just very briefly I mean infrastructure<br>is the basis for for these and I think<br>that is it's it's that it's that sort of<br>it's that Bedrock you think about what<br>is coming in terms of that digital<br>Revolution connectivity for all people<br>in this country digital connectivity and<br>energy connectivity as well but for<br>children like my kids today ensuring an<br>equal access to learning and Technology<br>because jobs that exist today whole<br>suedes of our economy are not going to<br>be there in 10 20 30 years time and so<br>the only way to arm ourselves in lie of<br>being able to predict exactly what's<br>needed and where is uh awareness and<br>education and skills that will be um<br>able to take advantage of those those<br>digital enhancements<br>so infrastructure the principle of<br>infrastructure as the Bedrock will<br>remain we've just got to yes we've got<br>to we've got to edate and we've got to<br>innovate in terms of what we we get from<br>our infrastructure and it is this thing<br>about all things being connected um<br>we've got to plan and and get greater<br>value and greater efficiency out of what<br>we build and that's um that is our it's<br>our national Challenge and it's<br>interesting that when you were making<br>those comments I was thinking back to<br>our session on on agriculture yesterday<br>in which we were talking also about this<br>intersection between technology and<br>making sure we've not just got the<br>technology but we've got the skills to<br>be able to to use it other any comments<br>on technology that technology and AI um<br>has such a huge driver of productivity<br>and opportunity for productivity we're<br>using it a lot now people talk about it<br>as if it's suddenly happened machine<br>learning's been around since the sort of<br>80s or before and if you think about the<br>market system that runs the electricity<br>Market in real time it's run off<br>algorithms all the time doing stuff um<br>so there's a lot of machine um you<br>algorithms AI stuff happening and it's<br>critical when you're running big<br>infrastructure because it helps you<br>predict be more efficient you know and<br>it's much smarter the way you run things<br>but again coming back to my analogy<br>about foundations on the house AI can<br>only work and help you if you have<br>really good data you understand what<br>problems you're trying to solve what's<br>the end case what data do I need to<br>solve that problem how do I best measure<br>it how do I make sure the data I'm<br>collecting is accurate quality data then<br>I can analyze it it's a bit like reiling<br>your house again you've got to have that<br>good data stuff and again I think that's<br>where as infrastructure we need to make<br>sure we have those foundations in place<br>before we can do all the smart stuff<br>it's a really exciting future out there<br>in this whole area but it does require<br>some pretty boring um getting the basics<br>in shape and investment in that and<br>that's been a comment you've made a few<br>times and of course your comments on AI<br>are very close to those of us working in<br>educational institutions where we we're<br>grappling with this issue of how do we<br>encourage students to use these<br>Technologies but use them sensibly and<br>not use a technology to rely on for the<br>answers but use the technology to help<br>you shape your information I'm going to<br>turn to we've just got got a minute and<br>a half left so if we can do a sort of 30<br>second wrap of our you know our topic is<br>this briefing to the intern uh incoming<br>government we've had a lot of<br>conversation about looking into what's<br>needed for infrastructure is a very far<br>but you know far into the future we need<br>to look but how about for the next three<br>to five three to five years let's talk<br>about that what would you like to see if<br>we join if we invite you back on this<br>panel in in say three years time what<br>would you most like to have seen happen<br>Nick develop the system oh sorry develop<br>the vision build the system and focus on<br>delivery that the next Government after<br>this one can pick up and deliver their<br>um their program on we we too much<br>shopping and changing too much Start<br>stop actually it is about just those<br>fundamentals of of of knowing what you<br>want to do uh having the the system<br>public and private to to deliver and<br>then actually get do the Mah and get it<br>done yeah for me very similar you know<br>we need to articulate the vision uh<br>around and structure what we need where<br>we're going and and what and and have<br>that General um understanding and<br>support um by the population base and we<br>just got to do things you know the<br>government needs to signal that things<br>are going to happen<br>and and making those signals now even if<br>things are not built in the next 3 years<br>that gives confidence and it and it<br>enables things to get started and get<br>moving and and Wier business Nos and<br>others will start to make investment<br>decisions based on what is coming so<br>signal signal early the decisions make<br>some hard calls and let's get on with<br>it and very similar get a plan we know<br>let's let's fa lean into this really<br>ugly challenge which is how big is this<br>infrastructure deficit both in terms of<br>Maintenance and what we want to do size<br>it take a deep breath and go okay what<br>can we afford to do both in terms of<br>available resources and funding and then<br>have a long-term plan and commit to it<br>think about all the infrastructure that<br>has to come up together it's no point<br>having perfect roads if you haven't got<br>the rest working and then um get on and<br>make the plan happen stop this chopping<br>and Chang the amount of money we invest<br>or we spend and then we Lurch to<br>something else and we waste it so let's<br>get a longterm plan let's commit to it<br>and let's accept that we have to have<br>good institutions with the right<br>capabilities competencies balance sheets<br>to make these Investments so that we can<br>be confident that the public money we're<br>spending is going to be value for money<br>for the services that we all deserve and<br>need I want to have quality drinking<br>water and I don't want to put poo on my<br>beaches pleas thank<br>you well we've had some some very wise<br>advice for this incoming uh government<br>both shortterm what to achieve in the<br>next three years but also looking far<br>into the future so thank you very much<br>to our panelist please don't go for your<br>break yet though because mat is coming<br>up but thank you very much for your for<br>the thank you thank<br>you thanks very<br>much thank<br>me thanks to our<br>panelists<br>all right we are in the home stretch we<br>are about to take our last break of the<br>Forum before we go into our last two<br>panel sessions I'll talk about those in<br>a moment a couple of other things first<br>uh there are some people in the room who<br>are going to an NZ Peck uh trade focused<br>lunch after this for those that are<br>doing that with uh Alan bolard that will<br>be in the room across to be once we'<br>finished the Forum um that's that's a<br>substit of the room then a couple C of<br>other people that I wanted to<br>acknowledge I can see in the room uh<br>Member of Parliament Ryan Hamilton uh<br>welcome thank you uh T Paka K uh in a<br>head-to-head battle with David halet for<br>the best shirts in the W uh hard to tell<br>who's winning this morning and also<br>acknowledge uh I miss last night uh Todd<br>mlay attended our dinner he was uh here<br>of course his minister of trade and of<br>Agriculture and while he didn't see the<br>sessions on those subjects yesterday I<br>did check last night there is an 8 hour<br>video it's not been sliced into the<br>component sessions so he's got a big<br>weekend of watching ahead of him and<br>also mayor Paula Southgate welcome uh<br>thank you for being here as well so uh<br>we move into uh short break now our next<br>session's very much focused on the<br>future two critical topics first climate<br>and weather what happens if we can't<br>curber missions very much looking<br>forward to that and then finish on<br>fintech critical sector and and how we<br>grow that for New Zealand so have a<br>break if we can be back here seated at 5<br>11 we'll get into it thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
