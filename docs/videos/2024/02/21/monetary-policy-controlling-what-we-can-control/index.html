and uh and of course very<br>important afternoon session too this one<br>is about monetary<br>policy uh and is<br>subtitled uh what will the interest rate<br>track be for the next two<br>years uh and my guests will all no they<br>hav't I haven't warned them of this we<br>will come to a consensus on what we<br>think the interest rates will be in the<br>next two years by the time we close the<br>session I guarantee you so stick around<br>you'll might find something with bitting<br>against um look it's uh wonderful to<br>have the opportunity to speak on this<br>topic at a time when I think monetary<br>policy has having the greatest impact on<br>the lives of ordinary new zealanders and<br>those in business than it has at any<br>time since the 1980s and um I stand to<br>be corrected on that but I think that's<br>about right we've had such a long period<br>where<br>of benign monetary policy conditions and<br>no doubt that's had an impact in terms<br>of uh people being surprised by the<br>impact of monetary policy through this<br>most recent five or six year period so<br>uh the session is uh monetary policy uh<br>the the conference of course is a guide<br>to the is a briefing to the incoming<br>government I've changed it slightly for<br>this session it's a briefing to the<br>incoming government and the arriving<br>governor who of course will be here with<br>us tomorrow morning there a chance for<br>us to discuss and sort our questions out<br>for the governor before he arrives uh to<br>present to us at breakfast time tomorrow<br>we have three excellent<br>panelists uh from Victoria University of<br>Wellington our former deputy Reserve<br>Bank Governor Grant<br>Spencer uh we have Bryce Wilkinson from<br>Capital economics a very<br>uh experienced and learned uh<br>macroeconomist<br>Economist uh and down the end lowering<br>the average age of the four of us a<br>little bit is from the A&amp;Z Bank Henry<br>Russell um and of course you'll know<br>that the A&amp;Z became a little bit of an<br>outlier this week on uh on estimates of<br>upcoming interest rate changes so we<br>will have that discussion with Henry in<br>view course and I see Don good rubbing<br>his hands with blee at the thought of<br>having that part of the conversation so<br>uh without further Ado we'll get each of<br>the panelists to have just a few minutes<br>setting out their stall we're going to<br>focus on three things really uh the<br>current environment uh and where we are<br>at at now and where we're likely to go<br>next uh Lessons Learned From the<br>pandemic because of course the current<br>environment is very much linked to<br>monetary policy during the pandemic and<br>then governance and<br>accountability what which is probably<br>the bit the particularly appes to the<br>government is what should they do if<br>anything to change the relationship that<br>the the New Zealand RB and what and<br>central banks generally uh should have<br>with their mandates so that's the topic<br>of conversations so I'm going to invite<br>Grant to come up and give us a few<br>minutes first and uh then the other two<br>and then we'll have questions<br>cheers<br>gr thank you Sten<br>um good afternoon everyone it's a<br>pleasure to be here and um thanks to Y<br>for inviting me here<br>today um to start with a few<br>facts um inflation has been<br>significantly outside the government's<br>Target band now for 11 quarters nearly<br>three years and it's not expected to<br>come back into the target uh till later<br>this year<br>so in light of this serious<br>non-performance what should the new<br>government be doing with regard to<br>monetary policy and the<br>bank well the first thing they've done<br>is amend the ACT to uh return from the<br>duel mandate to a single price stability<br>mandate I think this is a sensible thing<br>to<br>do and in myew you this is more than<br>just a symbolic uh change I think that<br>move will actually<br>change albeit subtly uh the balance of<br>risks around decisions going<br>forward what else should they do some<br>people uh have been calling for an<br>independent review of monetary<br>policy and that may be appropriate at<br>some point<br>however um I would wait for the internal<br>review to sort of run its course so that<br>they put out the bank put out um an<br>internal review document in late<br>22 um and they came to some conclusions<br>there but they also set out a work<br>program with nine points for areas for<br>improvement and for learning things such<br>as you know improving data<br>uh improving the<br>forecasts understanding better the<br>interaction between monetary policy and<br>Supply shocks and also the interaction<br>with fiscal policy these are these are<br>very important areas and very important<br>lessons um from this period um the<br>postco period so I think it's important<br>to wait and see what the bank comes up<br>with I think it's taken quite a long<br>time to do<br>that um and I'll be interested to see if<br>if uh Adrian you know has has comments<br>on progress on this work program<br>tomorrow<br>morning uh the other area I think where<br>the minister should take a look is at<br>some aspects of governance of the bank<br>especially with respect to uh<br>funding and with respect to the external<br>uh membership of govern the important<br>governing bodies the board and the<br>monetary policy<br>committee on the funding side<br>um I think there's something wrong with<br>the with process which has allowed<br>operational expenditure to increase by<br>130% over the past six years and for<br>employment uh to<br>double um over the same<br>period um you know the board and the<br>treasury the treasury is the monitoring<br>agency are meant to play a role here but<br>to me they've been rather ineffective in<br>providing uh Financial discipline to the<br>bank the other area of external<br>membership of the board and<br>MPC I think it's important to lift the<br>contribution of those external<br>members to increase their capability so<br>so that they can genuinely challenge the<br>decisions of Senior<br>Management<br>um and recent reviews both by the IBA<br>and by the bank of England have<br>highlighted this point about developing<br>more of a challenged culture from the<br>external members of the governing uh<br>bodies and I think that adding to that<br>would be a requirement that that at<br>least for the MPC members they have more<br>of a voice but they occasionally are<br>required to put their head above the<br>parit um so those are some um initial<br>thoughts and happy to uh comment further<br>during questions thanks thank you very<br>on thank you Stephen and thanks to the<br>organizers for um putting on this work<br>and giving us the opportunity to discuss<br>this um I want to start with a global<br>sort of picture because what our Central<br>Bank was doing was much the same as what<br>other central banks were doing at the<br>time and we need to see the reasons for<br>that and thinking about what's caused<br>what's happened which is in New Zealand<br>is pretty horrendous I think I I just<br>could hardly believe the the discussions<br>before um the uh the lockdowns about<br>modern monetary theories if you can<br>print money and don't have to raise<br>taxes anymore which wasn't in the<br>Reserve Bank it was in the community and<br>in the international debate modern<br>monetary theory was getting getting<br>things and then um and then the lockdown<br>and here you had GDP sort of plummeting<br>tourism sto and share prices H in record<br>highs and then housing prices taking off<br>and that was obviously a pathology and<br>then you had the Reserve Bank sort of<br>buying out of 50% of the government<br>stock market and paying prices for far<br>too much and ended up costing taxpayers<br>about 12 billion dollar for no<br>demonstrable benefits that I can see and<br>then where was Treasury and where was<br>the Minister of Finance and where was<br>Parliament there was no estimate of what<br>the loss was going to be for that so it<br>just whooshed through so so where it<br>starts I think and as it so often does<br>new New Zealand's just an open economy<br>what happens in world financial markets<br>we have to roll with we're like a twig<br>on the ocean wave and um the current<br>Malay I think started in the US um under<br>moral hazard underwriting financial<br>markets and the Greenspan when he was<br>head of the Federal Reserve he he kept<br>bailing easing up on monetary policy<br>when financial markets were looking a<br>bit weak and that became n known as the<br>green stain Spain put people could buy<br>sheares and bonds and that stuff knowing<br>that the price was weakened that the<br>Federal Reserve would probably put it<br>right then you had the the US government<br>sort of getting persuading Banks to lend<br>to people who had no money and no assets<br>and no the ability to repay and the two<br>big giants semi- government owned Giants<br>JY and Fanny mck uh funding about half<br>the US mortgage market and then those<br>derivative products developed from that<br>and went around the world and so we had<br>the global financial crash which really<br>had me sitting on the edge with my my<br>seat this sounded a bit like um the<br>Great Depression potentially unfolding<br>again so that was a great disaster and<br>um essentially what happened there is<br>that it was a banking crisis which<br>governments spiled out and they turned<br>it into a government debt crisis which<br>we've still got um US public debt is the<br>same as about the same as the percentage<br>of GDP in World War II at the end of<br>World War II but this is peace time and<br>um in 2021 uh the initiative published a<br>report by myself and uh Leonard Hong on<br>walking the path to the next Global<br>financial crisis because we could see<br>that interest rates would have to go up<br>and then um interest payments on public<br>debt would start to take an increasing<br>proportion of tax revenues in the worst<br>cases it can get up to about 20% of<br>taxes and Italy was looking like a<br>candidate still is looking very weak but<br>the us is very weak too and then um you<br>know the lockdowns happened inflation<br>took out and in<br>2022 uh gr wheeler the the previous<br>governor of The Reserve Bank here and<br>myself did a paper on um the lessons uh<br>it was globally focused at the major<br>central banks on what had gone wrong uh<br>and a bit about what needed to be done<br>and a pretty key message there was ubre<br>um there there were issues of dual<br>mandates which the US has and we had at<br>the time but essentially the one thing<br>you can be confident monetary policy can<br>do is affect inflation in the medium<br>term it can alter the real economy and<br>in the short term uh but it's hard to<br>predict how it does it Milton Freedman<br>famously said the legs are long and<br>variable and I think central banks um<br>you know we're thinking of the bank of<br>England uh the European Central Bank the<br>Federal Reserve Reserve Bank of<br>Australia they became too confident that<br>they could really ease back on monetary<br>policy and be smart enough to tighten up<br>and not let inflation break out and the<br>the economics just isn't good enough for<br>that a key thing I think is um they<br>failed to forecast inflation not just<br>them financial markets failed to<br>forecast uh inflation was going to break<br>out so did the macro economists<br>generally who are in that business so<br>it's uh but central banks are paid to<br>get it right um so they shouldn't let<br>themselves off the hook so and even when<br>inflation was breaking out they they<br>were predicting it would be temporary so<br>they they each six months they'd come<br>out with a high curve for inflation and<br>then they'd pull it right down within<br>the two-year Horizon so a big question<br>for me for our Reserve Bank for example<br>is just what resources are they putting<br>into trying to find out how they can<br>forecast inflation better and not not<br>put the country through all that again<br>um and I gather now I've heard on the<br>Great Vine that they are hiring someone<br>to do that so I'm I'm very I'm much more<br>comforted comforted to hear that it's<br>not going to be easy um I think every<br>every one of the major central banks<br>should be doing that and probably are<br>and we're probably going to learn more<br>from them um but that's yeah that's the<br>backdrop to it and it's the inflation<br>forecasts which um to me were were what<br>world markets got wrong and that Uber<br>was part of it monetary<br>policies is is a hard thing to find in<br>tune the real economy with because so<br>much depends on<br>perceptions how people react are they<br>going to decide The Reserve Bank was too<br>too too soft or too hard if it goes in<br>hard they're going to be thinking does<br>it really mean it will it back off when<br>unemployment starts to rise and those<br>things um they're very situation<br>dependent um so it's not easy thank you<br>thanks very much<br>Ry and<br>now a representative from the<br>bank<br>Henry um thanks Steven and thanks to the<br>university for having me<br>sorry in advance because I don't think<br>this um is going to be good news that<br>you're hoping to hear but yes A&amp;Z is<br>calling for two additional hikes to the<br>OCR I think our team is probably among<br>the O probably the only economics team<br>in the developed World calling for<br>additional hikes at the moment but I'm<br>happy to um take you through our<br>rationale for that but firstly it's it's<br>important to acknowledge that um the<br>weakness we've seen in the economy and<br>that's been a lot of the uh the<br>criticism I guess without call is that<br>why would the Reserve Bank be hiking<br>when the economy is 3% well economic GDP<br>per capita is is down 3% year year on<br>year in in September quarter last year<br>that's as as severe slowdown as we saw<br>during the GFC and look we're not<br>looking at the upcoming decision as a<br>clean slate and if you think back to<br>we're looking at it in the context of<br>what the Reserve Bank um said back in<br>November and the monetary policy<br>committee said that they had little<br>tolerance for any data surprises that<br>would suggest uh the delay or suggest a<br>delay in the return of inflation to<br>Target and that's exactly what they've<br>had over the summer months I mean uh<br>firstly on the inflation front domestic<br>driven component of inflation surprised<br>both The Reserve Bank and us on the<br>upside uh the labor market starting<br>point is a lot stronger um the labor<br>market continues to be present a picture<br>of relative<br>relative resilience currently and so<br>when we think back to the communications<br>there it's and indeed the reserve bank's<br>projections back in November they<br>signaled that um in their OCR track they<br>had 19 points um essentially just off<br>one hike pric in and so when we think<br>about the sum the aggregate of those<br>data surprises over the summer months we<br>think that they actually imply um some<br>additional points onto the OCR track but<br>the challenge for The Reserve Bank is<br>there's not that much room left before<br>they're actually Pro before they have a<br>full hike um in their projection and so<br>the committee is somewhat constrained um<br>in terms of delivering um the in terms<br>of um projecting a hike and not<br>delivering one particularly given um<br>that that has been the case for the last<br>two nps's um in some respects and so<br>there's certainly a risk that if if the<br>uh if if the Reserve Bank doesn't<br>deliver a hike the market um the market<br>will take that as that's the end of the<br>tightening cycle I think the second<br>Point as well is so how economists tend<br>to think about um essentially the<br>condition for sustainable core<br>disinflation is that we need to see<br>spare capacity emerge across the economy<br>and that's not absolutely clear in the<br>data currently and in fact in recent<br>months we've actually seen a tick up in<br>activity indicators that would suggests<br>that the economy is is stabilized and<br>potentially even rebounding before that<br>spere capacity has emerged and look<br>monetary policy is about risk management<br>at the end of the day where there's um<br>there's bound to be unforeseen shocks on<br>the horizon and when we think about the<br>reserve banks assessment in the coming<br>weeks and whether or not there is spare<br>capacity across the economy we think<br>they'll side they they'll be pretty<br>cautious and and the evidence is not<br>clear enough to suggest that now if<br>there was spear capacity that would<br>simply that that could mean that the the<br>the preferred approach would be to leave<br>the OCR unchanged and potentially hold<br>for a little longer than they have but<br>given the Reserve Bank signaled<br>intolerance for any delays uh we think<br>that they they they will hike um I'll<br>probably pause there and over over to<br>you Steven<br>thanks thank you very much an unpopular<br>um position but well<br>argued um keep your questions coming<br>through on the slide of folks we've got<br>a few here um as I said we're going to<br>try and split it roughly into where<br>we're at now um then let go back to<br>Lessons Learned and then talk a bit more<br>about governance and I suppose Henry's<br>comments certainly put us in the heir in<br>now gentlemen um I wanted to ask a<br>question to start with and I'm bit of a<br>monetary policy Hawk generally but just<br>in the last few weeks talking to a bunch<br>of firms around the country it feels<br>like the interest rates are really<br>taking a<br>toll uh and a sense that<br>perhaps just like central banks were<br>slow to go up that because of these long<br>and variable lags that Norton Freeman<br>used to speak to they might also be slow<br>to spot the turn uh in the in the<br>economy and I know particularly the New<br>Zealand interest rate Fes have come in<br>sort of March 2022 through the June 20e<br>July<br>2023 the last one was about just over 6<br>months ago I think is a general R wasn't<br>it that monetary policy takes 12 to 18<br>months to work through and then<br>everybody's looking at employment but<br>employment lags again normally compared<br>to the rest of the indicators so just<br>from the panel's perspective what's the<br>risk that the<br>banks just muck it up the other way now<br>right well I think that definitely is is<br>a risk that the the momentum of those T<br>of the tightening cycle as it plays<br>through the economy actually you know<br>has us already turning down so you have<br>to be very careful not to reinforce that<br>un necessarily if you're already making<br>progress uh with with inflation on the<br>downward track so I think the bank told<br>us the other day that um something like<br>80% of those OCR increases are now sort<br>of embedded in mortgage rates but<br>there's still more to go you know still<br>other<br>20% um so there's still more pressure to<br>come from the settings that they have<br>already um my other thought in terms of<br>thinking about whether the bank you know<br>I I have no um inside information<br>obviously but um I would look at from<br>the November MPS the news that's come<br>through um sure there's been the strong<br>labor market<br>report um but there's also been some<br>good news in terms of progress like the<br>the actual December uh CPI outcome was<br>lower than the bank had built into the<br>November<br>MPS um just the other day inflation<br>expectations has has come down um you<br>know quite substantially so that's<br>another uh piece of good news and of<br>course they had that um uh the GDP p<br>number for the for Q3 which um you know<br>show was showing quite a depressed<br>picture for for GDP even though that was<br>latter part of last year so all I'm<br>saying is if you if you look at the<br>November position and the sort of net<br>net of news that's come through then<br>plus the fact you've got some still in<br>store tightening from existing settings<br>I I would not expect the bank to hike<br>any further I'd expect the bank to sit<br>at the current setting and wait for more<br>evidence that uh progress is being made<br>on uh lowering inflation thank you ryce<br>you you know this history pretty well<br>have we ever had a sharper tightening<br>cycle than what we've had in the last 12<br>or 18 months no I don't think so but we<br>hadn't had such a good losing one before<br>then so so the volatility is been been<br>great it's been like a whip really might<br>know better than me but yeah I I I'm the<br>answer to the question I'm like you I'm<br>normally a hawk I can give two arguments<br>for and two against really the the<br>arguments against easing or or any drift<br>of complacency are I think one is that<br>house prices are going up again the<br>other one is in the last week I think it<br>was I read a a an article in The<br>Economist which was citing someone's<br>extensive historical research of<br>episodes around the world in the last 30<br>or 40 years where central banks have had<br>to Titan to reduce inflation and um what<br>that history apparently showed was<br>there's that a a consistent bias a<br>strong bias to easing too early and then<br>finding they they have to uh tighten up<br>again and and it's easy to see the<br>pressure on them because uh the whole<br>Community hates to see the interest<br>rates going up they're hurting and the<br>economy is turning down so the there's<br>strong sort of pressure on the to do<br>that on on the on the opposite side of<br>the equation um for a long time there's<br>uh there's been uh and this is quite a<br>long conversation let me be short there<br>there's a thing called the US Tailor's<br>rule which is an indication of where<br>interest rates would need to be given<br>the level of excess activity in the<br>economy uh in the inflation rate to get<br>the inflation rate down and our OCR has<br>been way below that indicative figure<br>until recently um if you look on a web<br>page called GDP live you'll see that<br>there's an estimate of the tailor or<br>thing and as of yesterday it was<br>6.1% and the OCR is 5.5 and that's the<br>smallest the Gap it's been so on that<br>basis which is very hay basis um you<br>know policy is certainly within the<br>standard era of the accuracy of this<br>thing about there the other thing is is<br>um there are a couple of um Global<br>economists who who I respect who are<br>arguing That central banks stop looking<br>at the money supply growth and it<br>doesn't make sense to Economist just to<br>look at Price say the interest rate not<br>really the price um CPI is really the<br>the interest rate and not look at what's<br>happening to the quantity of credit<br>going on and um our money supply growth<br>was about 12% I think in the uh in at<br>its peak in about 2021 it's now running<br>M3 at about 3.3% in the last calendar<br>year so on that basis um that's looking<br>like a really big correction is taking<br>place and it's you it's hard to find<br>causes with alarm with what's happening<br>to monetary policy<br>go okay so Henry you've heard the other<br>panelists a andz rushing off to revise<br>their prediction no look I I would say I<br>mean there is certainly a risk that<br>hiking would be a policy mistake and<br>there has been progress over the um in<br>recent time but it's really the pace of<br>progress that concerns us and we think<br>which will concern The Reserve Bank um<br>picking up on what Grant mentioned about<br>inflation expectations for example yes<br>inflation expectations declined pretty<br>they took a meaningful step down across<br>across um all time Horizons but if you<br>look at the one-year measure the reserve<br>bank's own forecasts for one year ahead<br>has inflation at<br>25% um our own forecast is<br>2.3% the the inflation expectations are<br>at 3.1% of that Horizon they're not back<br>in within the reserve bank's Target ban<br>that's likely to be a concern the same<br>applies at the 2-year Horizon as well<br>and if you think about the progress on<br>the inflation front as well what we've<br>seen is the reserve banks received very<br>healthy dividend from the global<br>disinflation story but the challenge<br>with that is it's it's it's not<br>necessarily an enduring form of of of<br>disinflation and for example this week<br>we saw data on um from stats' new<br>monthly price indexes and that was a lot<br>weaker than we expected but almost all<br>of that was due to Sharp Falls and<br>airfares um Supply Cap Supply capacity<br>for air seats on airlines into and now<br>New Zealand is obviously recovering from<br>the pandemic but aairs are not going to<br>fall forever um there and there is<br>certainly a risk that this um<br>normalization in Global Supply and the<br>the the disinflation we're seeing on the<br>tradable side of the basket washes<br>through and ex and exposers are still<br>still sticky domestic inflation and we<br>really have not seen enough we have seen<br>progress but it just has not been fast<br>enough and in fact on our forecast we we<br>we we we expect and and the upcoming q1<br>release that non-tradables inflation<br>will again surprise The Reserve Bank on<br>the upside so even if you are seeing<br>weakness in economic activity um The<br>Reserve Banks does not have a growth<br>Target they have an inflation Target and<br>they need to return inflation to the 2%<br>Target in the medium term and on the on<br>balance at the moment it looks like that<br>that that may not be achieved there's<br>certainly um other pieces of data in our<br>own in our business Outlook survey for<br>example that showed pricing and tensions<br>have um they've stopped declining and<br>they've normalized which would imply<br>that inflation there's certainly a risk<br>that inflation normalizes above Target<br>so we can't we're certainly not<br>discounting the progress that we've seen<br>but really it's about when we look at<br>the medium term which is the reserve<br>bank's Target can we be can um can we be<br>sure that that disinflation is going to<br>be<br>enduring okay there you go you pays your<br>money and you takes your choice in terms<br>of what you think um market in terms of<br>I one thing I did want to touch on<br>before we move more to the lessons is<br>what's happening in China currently we<br>often look to the US Federal Reserve<br>because we have a kinship I suppose in<br>the Western World with with the US<br>Federal Reserve and with the Australian<br>Central Bank uh but there's some things<br>going on in China<br>currently uh which probably or perhaps<br>we're not taking enough cognizance of<br>which is the emerging deflation and the<br>trouble they're having getting getting<br>their economy going again what impact<br>does that potentially have on New<br>Zealand's inflation Outlook if anything<br>and is it helpful in a purely selfish<br>way or actually does it cause US<br>problems well I I think it probably is<br>helpful uh because weak demand in China<br>is you know all commodity prices are<br>pretty weak at present that's<br>contributing to this overall weakness in<br>traded Goods prices which is the good<br>part you know inflation in New Zealand<br>the traded Goods inflation is coming<br>down a lot faster than the domestic you<br>know non-trade and inflation so<br>contributing to that obviously is the<br>tightening of monetary policy globally<br>across all central banks but also the<br>fact that<br>China is you know very weak and um<br>demand is not been recovering in the<br>post in the postco period so I would say<br>that's definitely contributing to to you<br>know lower commodity prices and it's<br>taking pressure off uh Trader Goods<br>prices contributing to that disinflation<br>that we're seeing globally okay anybody<br>else want to add anything to that would<br>I just have P viewers with the floating<br>exchange rate we don't have to buy<br>anyone else's inflation rate we choose<br>our<br>own just then looking back for the last<br>few years why did Mr Question free from<br>the slid why why did our Central Bank<br>but actually most central banks fail to<br>pick the the the challenge with<br>inflation and and and you one of you<br>said yourselves that you know the<br>expectation was that it was transitory<br>they really thought that they were on<br>top of the situation and it feels like<br>group thing but then you've got some<br>very bright people in these<br>organizations with some very strong<br>I might just jump in sorry Grant go I I<br>think firstly um you know hindsight is a<br>wonderful thing and if you think back to<br>the context in 2020 across um not only<br>the Reserve Bank but central banks<br>globally it did look as though you know<br>economies were on the brink of collapse<br>at the start of at the onset of the the<br>pandemic and it was economists like<br>ourselves we misdiagnosed the nature of<br>the shock it um we thought it was going<br>to be a negative demand shock and the<br>appropriate Monet appropriate monetary<br>policy response and fiscal policy for<br>that matter as well as to inject<br>stimulus into the economy but obviously<br>that turned out not to be true it was uh<br>it was a significant negative Supply<br>shock and so that is probably the the<br>key reason that we have high inflation<br>today is one that misdiagnosis to begin<br>with but two that stimulus measures<br>persisted for far too long in the early<br>stages of the pandemic but look and<br>hindsight is a wonderful thing you say<br>hindsight but I had Grant Spencer on<br>this panel two years ago and there were<br>three of us actually including your boss<br>Sharon was part of the thing four of us<br>and I think three of us at that stage<br>agreed that the central bank had done<br>the right thing to start with but we're<br>getting worried about the supply side<br>effects and and the failure to notice<br>that actually they were dealing with a<br>different problem to the problem that<br>they thought they were dealing with and<br>I think everybody was at the you know<br>you close an economy down everybody goes<br>oh my God what are we doing you know we<br>have to supply stimulus I don't think<br>there were too many people against that<br>at the start but there was certainly a<br>change wasn't there Grant in terms of<br>and and with central banks did they fail<br>to<br>respond well I think it was early<br>21 even late 2020 the signs were coming<br>through that the very EAS monetary<br>policy com combined with the adverse uh<br>Supply shot was starting to see<br>inflation pressures come through as you<br>say people said oh it's transitory it's<br>transitory so there was this wait wait<br>wait um by early 21 I think it was<br>pretty clear that monetary policy should<br>be brought back towards neutral as<br>opposed to having the foot you know flat<br>on the gas still at that point so you<br>know the bank's own internal<br>review I came to the conclusion that<br>monetary policy rather than starting to<br>tighten in late 21 should have tighten<br>early<br>21 okay and I and I would agree with<br>that so with hindsight that's<br>sensible um the bank says okay we should<br>have tightened a bit earlier but really<br>you know we still would have had an<br>inflation problem so to me it pushes<br>back in terms of thinking about<br>lessons what the earlier the earlier<br>easing was just too extreme for the<br>situation that we had to me this is the<br>important lesson that we need to sort of<br>figure out when you have a big adverse<br>Supply shock so capacity is diminishing<br>is there any point really in putting<br>your foot on the gas with monetary<br>policy expanding demand at the time when<br>Supply is<br>shrinking at the at the same time we<br>call we you know this was a CO shop we<br>had a huge fiscal response and the<br>fiscal response is what did the work the<br>fiscal response is what kept the economy<br>going what kept people<br>employed you know what additional<br>benefit was that very easy monetary<br>policy other than you know pushing house<br>prices up did it actually achieve<br>anything you know I I I question that<br>that's what I think the key question is<br>for the bank and its internal review is<br>to think you know this is not a blame<br>game this is about if you had a similar<br>situation down the track you know how<br>would you respond differently and I<br>think you should you should think very<br>hard about the very uh extreme easing<br>when you've got an adverse Supply shock<br>if fiscal policy is actually you know in<br>the driving seat and doing the work does<br>it really need to be all hands to the<br>pump I don't I think the expost to the<br>conclusion is that it wasn't the<br>appropriate uh<br>response let's expand on that a little<br>Bryce one of the things that you talked<br>about when we were discussing this panel<br>ear in the week was the unconventional<br>monetary policies that accompany the<br>interest rate declines I think both of<br>you particularly brought that out um<br>where are we at with unconventional<br>policy tools now are<br>we should we be thinking that that you<br>know it's it's a it's a real because it<br>feels to me that twice in the last 12 or<br>15 years we've seen Banks doing<br>quantitive easing it feels like it's<br>almost become part of the standard<br>monetary policy toolbox and yet it's a<br>it's a big it's like the break used to<br>be like the break glass you know real<br>emergency thing what where are we going<br>with all of that I with the Reserve Bank<br>um to it credit did did publish a a<br>review by external people assessing um<br>lessons from Co in the response and that<br>review surprised me by saying well that<br>this quantitative easing this Q QE was<br>successful and should be part of a<br>future package and I just couldn't see<br>that that case had been made um at all<br>convincingly um another exive B guy Mike<br>Rell is is quite convinced that um it<br>has no discernable effect um<br>I I'm not there I haven't seen the<br>evidence for that to to form a view<br>myself in my reading of the literature<br>um what's a very important element is<br>what interest rate The Reserve Bank is<br>paying on all the banking systems<br>reserves which are building up at The<br>Reserve Bank um under a an aggressive QE<br>uh policy which is what we had massive<br>expansion and the reserve bank's balance<br>sheet and um the higher that interest<br>rate then the more the money can just<br>sit there because the banks are happy<br>they they don't have to lend it out<br>they're getting an adequate return on it<br>sitting there so that's uh that's an<br>element of it too and it's an element to<br>give the Reserve Bank credit that um in<br>those documents they recognized that<br>that argument that with the technical<br>terms in the US are Flor and coral or<br>systems were played but we won't go into<br>them now but um the Federal Reserves<br>also changed in the last decade uh it's<br>its interest rate policy on the banking<br>system as reserves held at the various<br>federal reserve banks so there is quite<br>a literature on this so yeah I'm not at<br>all convinced that that QE had um a<br>useful<br>effect is um sorry can I comment on that<br>yeah sure um I mean I think the the<br>banks internal review said well sort of<br>you know a cautious sort of tick uh but<br>really quantitative easing or the elap<br>program was was most useful for<br>countering Market disruption that<br>happened in the bond market around April<br>2020 and I agree with that but the<br>ongoing use of the lsap was very<br>questionable in terms of any additional<br>benefit it got in the meantime it caused<br>distortions and was pretty and very<br>costly so you know there's a sort of a<br>cautious Acceptance in the internal<br>review i' say one of the external<br>reviewers uh Mr shambre from the Bank of<br>Canada was quite skeptical about the uh<br>additional monetary policy instruments<br>and he thought there was really a need<br>for a more thorough analysis of that and<br>he questioned you know really put some<br>question marks on on the bank's own<br>internal<br>conclusions I would I I would just say<br>that of the of the various instruments<br>you could keep keep them on the Shelf<br>negative OCR I would take off the table<br>I think negative<br>OCR is a very distortionary totally<br>confusing and adds very little benefit<br>the bank never did that of course but it<br>was uh threatening to it was talking<br>about it and it's now has it in its<br>toolbox well I would I would drop that<br>part of the toolbox just one thing I'd<br>add as well on those alternative<br>monetary policy<br>um the for just going on picking up from<br>Grant's point and it was certainly<br>effective at um restoring um Market<br>function and but moving aside from the<br>elet program the other one of the other<br>um measures the Reserve Bank implemented<br>was the funding for lending program yes<br>and that to me was I I I didn't see the<br>justification for that um I think one it<br>was not there was no funding crisis in<br>New Zealand at the time there were bouts<br>of liquidity crisis and the elet program<br>was effective at restoring um improving<br>liquidity in the market but the funding<br>for lending program was implemented at<br>um at a time where we had passed the<br>worst of the the um the co period and it<br>was based on um The Reserve bank's<br>economic projection and inflation<br>projections which turned out to be um to<br>not come true obviously the economy<br>performed much much stronger than<br>expected and in their defense and<br>forecasting is challenging at the best<br>of times but in that context it was<br>incredibly challenging but I mean that<br>that program itself I think is one that<br>it was I think it's I think these tools<br>can be effective in certain situations<br>but they were implemented in a way that<br>was not and it was essentially putot on<br>the gas type situation where everything<br>was um put out on the table when um when<br>it was probably not necessary by that<br>point<br>the is there any because you gentlemen<br>have all read the reviews and so on is<br>there any sense that central banks<br>really understand the impact that<br>they've had on people's lives with some<br>of these decisions because I I see a<br>disconnect when you<br>have uh you know it was was was called<br>you know famously a least regrets<br>policy U to do all this stuff and there<br>was a sense we were throwing everything<br>at the wall which at the initial stages<br>was understandable and we were<br>encouraging people to lend more<br>money uh to borrow more money sorry and<br>and telling people to get out there buy<br>houses borrow money and now a lot of<br>people are high and dry uh businesses<br>are high and dry so these are real<br>people with massive interest rate builds<br>and I I worry when I read the tenor of<br>some of these reviews that there's a<br>lack of acknowledgement of the impact<br>even if it was UN<br>unforeseeable there's a lack of uh I<br>suppose empathy for some of the people<br>that did exactly what they were told and<br>and have now been caught the other way<br>you fol have any thoughts on<br>that yeah I think central banks have<br>lost status I think with<br>this yeah it's a blow to their<br>credibility the point that you know the<br>bank the bank's objective two key<br>objectives are price stability and<br>financial stability and when it comes to<br>financial stability it's about the<br>soundness of the banking system that's<br>what they're there to protect they're<br>not actually there to<br>protect uh the soundness of households<br>and of business<br>or to minimize the uncertainties and<br>volatility in markets facing them but<br>you're exactly right you know for<br>example with the with the housing market<br>house prices went up 50% over two years<br>and then came down the other side of the<br>roller coaster the bank thinks about<br>that in terms of what's that doing for<br>Price stability is that giving you know<br>in terms of the machine tweaking the uh<br>dials to influence aggregate demand<br>and is it covered in terms of the<br>credential risk to the banking system<br>they not it's not actually in their<br>brief to look at the impact on the<br>household and business sectors in terms<br>of volatility disruption and you know I<br>I think there is more of a role for that<br>to you know for them to take that into<br>account one one thing I would say is<br>that the Reserve Bank is not cannot<br>control the decisions that that<br>households may make I mean it's slightly<br>different in the Australian context if<br>you remember Governor Low's remarks um<br>the Ford guidance that was given which<br>um was clearly a mistake and potent and<br>that's that's a risk I mean we didn't<br>necessarily see that to the extent in<br>New Zealand but it's the in terms of the<br>the they've lost empathy as as Grant<br>said I mean the Reserve Bank has two<br>objectives and monetary policy tools are<br>fairly blunt and fiscal policy has a<br>role in kind of smoothing through or in<br>terms of the distributional um impacts<br>of that but it's it's not necessarily<br>responsibility UND<br>understood let's talk though a little<br>bit more about the preserving the<br>independence of central banks because<br>I'm a great believer in an independent<br>Central Bank um I think you know it's an<br>innovation that New Zealand helped lead<br>the world on and one one of the ones<br>that really worked but there is a sense<br>perhaps perhaps both with these<br>unconventional monetary policy tools but<br>also in the sort of uh changing<br>interests of Central Banking things like<br>climate change and other parts of the<br>economy that they're being drawn into<br>areas that<br>perhaps uh more<br>political um and even something like<br>debt to income ratios which you could<br>argue at one level is the right thing to<br>do from a monetary policy and stability<br>level but you're also getting into some<br>pretty granular impacts on individual uh<br>people and Society is there a danger and<br>I'm not picking on the RB and Z because<br>I don't think it's Unique to them is<br>there a danger that you get into a<br>situation where you've been successful<br>with one tool or one objective and<br>people start thinking oh you could do<br>all these other things as well um and<br>protect the world from itself and does<br>that actually undermine the Mandate<br>ultimately I think it potentially does<br>and you know in some countries when uh<br>Central Bank Independence was was<br>becoming the norm you know some<br>countries separated out the presedential<br>function that happened in Australia it<br>happened in the UK you know Gordon Brown<br>took out presedential is I'm going to<br>make you independent on monetary policy<br>so you can't have all this other stuff<br>to control so there's an element of<br>Truth in that and when it comes to our<br>own Central<br>Bank it does not have the same degree of<br>Independence on credential policy and<br>for example macro<br>Pro as it does on monetary policy so<br>with the debt to income ratios for<br>example it can't just decide to go and<br>do it it has to consult and and you know<br>talk talk to government get the approval<br>of the minister so I mean I'm sure the<br>bank will acknowledge does not have the<br>same degree of<br>Independence uh for for those some of<br>those other functions as it does for a<br>monetary policy Independence but the the<br>the other element that has come in and<br>be an area of criticism has been the use<br>of quantitative easing and credit easing<br>credit eing being when the central bank<br>is buying private sector Securities not<br>just government securities then it's<br>effectively making fiscal type decisions<br>as who's which security to buy at which<br>price Etc and it starts blurring that<br>division between monetary policy and<br>fiscal policy and which becomes an issue<br>for Independence as you say so the yeah<br>when when that becomes an issue yeah<br>make sure you stick stick to knitting<br>and um be very careful if you start<br>dabbling getting into some of the other<br>areas what are your thoughts on yeah<br>exactly what you say that the mission<br>creep if an organization seem to be<br>successful in in one area load more onto<br>it I think farx a victim of that was<br>putting medical devices into it I think<br>to a degree the public<br>finance a a<br>bit has experiencing a bit of that the<br>fiscal responsibility stuff was put into<br>it and it was effective but now people<br>are reading other stuff on on our our<br>Reserve Bank um I think I'm on record<br>with that with that paper with grand<br>wheeler we said one of the problems we<br>thought we identified among central<br>banks is the um distractions from<br>getting into areas which aren't Central<br>to uh monetary policy inflation or to<br>systemic risk risk of banking sector<br>breakdown and um so you obvious the<br>climate change and Indigenous uh issues<br>in the case of our Reserve Bank um but<br>also uh I think it gives it a conflict<br>of interest to make it responsible for<br>regulating um the whole a whole s of of<br>smaller of financial organizations like<br>insurance companies Credit Unions<br>finance companies and all that if they<br>go b a bust it it doesn't affect the<br>stability of the banking system but if<br>you have a central bank regulating them<br>if one of them goes bust the depositors<br>there will say hey the regulator wasn't<br>doing its job it it said that if it does<br>everything right then it sound but it's<br>done everything right and here I've lost<br>my money um and that that that starts to<br>undermine the bank's goal of an<br>efficient Financial system we should see<br>competitors come in fail if they if they<br>if they're unsuccessful be successful<br>and the incumbent sort of suffer so I<br>I'm a bit sympathetic as and I'm on<br>record of saying this of of having um<br>something like the what the Australians<br>have done a separate uh Financial<br>Authority which is doing the regulation<br>of individual financial institutions and<br>so our Central Bank definitely isn't to<br>blame if a credit union insurance<br>company goes under so it sounds like<br>both of you and I'm not sure whether<br>Henry want to comment on this or not<br>given that he's regulated by the Reserve<br>Bank but for the two of you anyway you'd<br>probably favor breaking out the<br>credential responsibilities of the<br>Reserve Bank from The Reserve Bank um I<br>personally wouldn't you wouldn't no<br>because I<br>mean to me in a small country like New<br>Zealand there are this is a valid<br>criticism but there are but there are<br>argu arguments on the other side as well<br>in particular when you have a crisis as<br>in the GFC there's a lot of synergy<br>between the mon the monetary policy and<br>the liquidity management people the<br>money market people and the credential<br>people and in terms of managing our<br>response to the GFC I I think it was<br>really valuable to have those two<br>functions in the same<br>building um so also with this small<br>country you can have a critical mass for<br>an organization you mix skills being<br>moved around I my own view is they<br>should stay together despite this issue<br>right I just say one thing on one<br>potential benefit not that I don't have<br>a firm view either way but if you think<br>back to when the lvrs were eased last<br>year that was at a time where the<br>Reserve Bank was still hiking I believe<br>and it would have made the<br>communications a bit clearer that um you<br>know some easing of elvs at a time um<br>policy I mean um monetary policy was was<br>still tightening it was that it kind of<br>blurred the communication a bit in that<br>that circumstance um and so you know<br>macr predial policies and monetary<br>policy they're very separate things but<br>when they're under the same house there<br>are risks that they can be confused I<br>would say okay we're into we're getting<br>into that sort of governance and<br>responsibilities area um there's been a<br>few comments and there's a few questions<br>here about the importance of<br>strengthening the external membership of<br>the monetary policy committee<br>potentially also the board um that's an<br>interesting role of course you know the<br>the the board versus the MPC<br>internationally of course the FED<br>Reserve has uh much more transparency in<br>terms of the members of their committees<br>talking out talking their book<br>effectively between meetings what do you<br>think advising the new Minister do you<br>think should be done to strengthen that<br>role to the advantage to improve the the<br>the results of the Reserve<br>Bank well ju just briefly I just<br>reinforce what I said in my initial<br>comments which was you know I think<br>there's a strong case to increase the<br>capability to try and engender a<br>challenge culture and I think it would<br>be reinforced and in fact I think this<br>is a recommendation in the recent IBA<br>review is that they're proposing you<br>know rather than a board say the their<br>policy board being made of sort of<br>captains of industry that be shifting to<br>more people with expertise experience<br>Etc in uh monetary policy macroeconomics<br>that one of their recommendations is<br>that like those members should at least<br>uh be required to come and uh give a<br>give a speech or you know have a voice<br>at least once a year I think that was<br>one one of the recommendations so<br>something like that will I think would<br>help to reinforce that approach rather<br>than just being you know buried in the<br>Machinery<br>somewhere R yeah I I think we've lost<br>something in<br>accountability um remember when when Don<br>Brash was the first governor Under The<br>Reserve Bank act and he had to get<br>inflation down it was very high because<br>of the wage wage the break out from the<br>wage and price free and all that and um<br>I think he missed the 2% Target which uh<br>he had to had to try and get and I think<br>he had to write a letter of explanation<br>to the Minister of Finance I think well<br>we don't have that at the moment I and I<br>quite like the system which has been<br>changed now where it was it was the<br>governor who was clearly accountable for<br>the inflation Target now we've got a<br>monetary policy committee and external<br>people on and a lot of secrecy really<br>about what's been debated and what's<br>said there I think that's weakened<br>accountability a bit um I don't know if<br>it's improved I've got no reason to<br>think it's improved the quality of the<br>advice the governor gets because the<br>governor before this change was<br>obviously Consulting colleagues and and<br>um leading a team and and would have to<br>try and bring his colleagues with him<br>and get himself isol or herself isolated<br>um I think yeah the move to the single<br>mandate again I I fully support for<br>accountability reasons um but uh the<br>other thing is the role of the board and<br>um to what degrees it's accountable I<br>think we're probably moving in a better<br>Direction my I wasn't around I wasn't in<br>um treasury at the time the Reserve Bank<br>Act was decided but what was conscious<br>in my mind there was sort of what we<br>call now fiscal dominance that I found<br>when I got into treasury that an<br>individual trading Bank could tell the<br>Reserve Bank how much money it wanted it<br>needed to restore its cash position and<br>then it could also tell it what the<br>interest rate would be well it could<br>only do that if it had Mr Mal's approval<br>but but he might he might give it for<br>for sort of fiscal reasons so um with<br>the the board was set up to protect the<br>Governor from that sort of um under the<br>table no one these all private<br>conversations you know Parliament or<br>even even the prime minister's<br>colleagues probably didn't know about<br>the conversation so uh but now um it's a<br>different situation and um I think the<br>moves to a more conventional board um<br>which has greater wayway over the<br>governor is uh is right uh we're running<br>out of time with standing between um<br>everybody in a drink um which is always<br>a dangerous place to stand um to wrap<br>up and and I would note we've sort of<br>let fiscal policy off the hook a little<br>bit through this discussion not<br>intentionally we haven't we haven't<br>focused too much in on fiscal policy but<br>this is is an advice uh to the incoming<br>government The Briefing to the minister<br>so just to quickly down the group what<br>would be your key bit of advice that we<br>haven't talked about so far to the<br>Minister of Finance uh in terms of<br>getting out of this cycle and and<br>setting the bank up for the future<br>want to start Henry I think um fiscal<br>consolidation is probably the thing that<br>I think is top of the list and it's not<br>necessar certainly support The Reserve<br>Bank and and meeting their objective but<br>um yeah there's certainly been an<br>immense amount of fiscal stimulus over<br>the past few years and it's been a<br>challenge to to wind that back but it's<br>absolutely necessary when you look at<br>the external position of New Zealand and<br>you know we're a small open economy<br>vulnerable to shocks and we need to be<br>in a position to respond to those as<br>they emerge<br>BR yeah I'm a hawk I I think the 1 to 3%<br>inflation rate is far too high uh the<br>not to 2% I thought was probably about<br>right because the the bosan report in<br>the US and the early 70s concluded that<br>CPI drift was about 7.8% perom so the<br>midpoint of not to two is about price<br>ability and the central feature that the<br>central biggest thing in the Reserve<br>Bank Act was Reserve Bank was to uh<br>achieve and then maintain stability in<br>the general level of prices the general<br>level of prices that should be a zero<br>change in the CPI of properly measured<br>um and we've had uh we've had you know<br>our currency is worth a fraction of what<br>it was when that Act was passed in 1988<br>was it um so yeah
