Lee lecture series, visit the Antarctic Research Centre website: https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/antarctic<br><br>Antarctica is vast—more than 50 times the size of the United Kingdom or New Zealand. Most of its land is covered by ice, up to four kilometres in places. Only occasionally do mountain ranges peek out from underneath the ice.<br> <br>The remote and beautiful white continent is said to provide one of the purest experiences of nature that our planet still has on offer. But just like the rest of our planet, Antarctica is feeling the consequences of human-induced climate change.<br> <br>It is losing ice, and this is happening at an accelerating rate. What happens in Antarctica, however, does not stay in Antarctica. The amount of ice lost under 1, 2 or even 3 degrees Celsius of future warming will determine sea level around the shores of our continents and impact livelihoods in coastal regions across the globe.<br> <br>What will the scale of future sea-level rise be and how quickly will it happen? These are difficult questions to answer. In this talk, Professor Tina van de Flierdt will take you on her personal journey of asking questions, finding answers, and uncovering more questions.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

extraordinary record of<br>philanthropy and support of education<br>and learning spanned several decades and<br>his legacy continues after his passing<br>last July at the venerable age of<br>99 Dr Lee received an honorary doctor of<br>literature from tading aaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington in<br>2006 the university is grateful for his<br>support and his efforts to Foster<br>excellence in education and the<br>continuing support of the Lee<br>foundation events such as this lecture<br>contribute to the world leading<br>scholarship undertaken by the<br>University's Antarctic Research Center<br>and their goal to better understand<br>antar Arctic processes and their<br>influence on climate change and the<br>consequences both globally and for New<br>Zealand the University's involvement in<br>Antarctic research goes back over 60<br>years our Antarctic Research Center was<br>formally established in<br>1972 providing a platform for our re our<br>scientists to lead the way in developing<br>drilling systems to extract geological<br>samples and better investigate ancient<br>climate changes on an on the Antarctic<br>continent uh the center also offers<br>teaching and government advisory<br>services with several staff involved in<br>prominent International efforts such as<br>the intergovernmental panel on climate<br>change more recently the center has<br>become a global leader in the Computing<br>computer modeling of glaciers and ice<br>sheets in response to climate<br>change it has grown to be recognized as<br>a world leader in Antarctic science and<br>a key player in major research<br>operations attracting significant<br>government investment and interest the<br>Antarctic research Cent's work<br>contributes significantly to the<br>University's efforts to enhance<br>resilience and<br>sustainability to maintain research<br>Partnerships with local and Global<br>organizations and contribute to the<br>resolution of some of the most pressing<br>challenges facing the world<br>today the annual<br>Lee lecture is an important event in the<br>center's<br>calendar it provides a valuable<br>opportunity to hear from an<br>internationally renowned guest and to<br>celebrate the successful research and<br>collaboration programs being undertaken<br>by our<br>scientists our speaker tonight Professor<br>vaner FL is an expert in isotope<br>geochemistry and head of the Department<br>of earth science and engineering at<br>Imperial College<br>London her research spans a variety of<br>fields from understanding chemical<br>cycles of Trace elements and pollutants<br>in the ocean to the Reconstruction of<br>ocean circulation and its relationship<br>to climate and the history of the polar<br>ice sheets and their vulnerability to<br>Future climate<br>change Tina is particularly interested<br>in the response of the Antarctic ice<br>sheet to warmer temperatures and the<br>implications for for future sea levels<br>around the world and I particularly like<br>this she's a stubborn Optimist and<br>values working across disciplines and in<br>collaboration with diverse teams of<br>people during her career Professor vanl<br>has held a number of academic positions<br>in Europe and in the United States and<br>currently leads the mass spectrometry<br>and isotope geochemistry facility at<br>Imperial College London uh she departs<br>for Antarctica next week to be co-chief<br>of the upcoming sus Toc Scientific<br>Drilling program there our suway Toc is<br>an international in initiative involving<br>researchers from New Zealand the United<br>States Germany Australia Italy Japan<br>Spain South Korea the Netherlands and<br>the United<br>Kingdom esteemed guests and colleagues<br>please join me in welcoming Professor<br>Podium thanks so much for this wonderful<br>um introduction and and good afternoon<br>and good evening everybody uh thanks for<br>coming to this lecture it's an absolute<br>honor and privilege to be here today and<br>give um the St Le<br>lecture<br>I want to start with um a picture I<br>really like looking at actually back<br>home in my office it's on the background<br>of the big stream I have there um always<br>giving a calming influence on whoever<br>sits on on the office table and it's a<br>picture that was taken in February 2010<br>um when I went on my first drilling<br>Expedition ever to the<br>Antarctic and that kind of expedition<br>was quite a bit of a a turning point uh<br>for me in in my career um as a person<br>and as a scientist so I wanted to start<br>there and um I want to start doing like<br>a little bit of um my journey and you<br>heard some of that already in the<br>introduction um I started really growing<br>up in the countryside in rural Germany<br>on a dairy farm and um it was a very<br>switched on geography teacher who<br>inspired me together with my love for<br>nature to actually think about studying<br>something I didn't even know existed and<br>that was called geology so I kind of<br>discovered my love for rocks um and that<br>particular Rock there um I loved a lot<br>that was the rock I worked on for my<br>master Caesar and I learned that kind of<br>looking at that rock it can tell you a<br>lot of stories about our planet and when<br>you look at the chemistry of that rock<br>you can learn even more about our planet<br>so that that was really intriguing I<br>then figured well if you look at the<br>chemistry of the ocean you could do even<br>more you can learn about these<br>circulation pedants of the ocean how it<br>connect<br>climate and then I figured which for<br>somebody from Europe is quite a step if<br>you actually look down here at the<br>Southern Ocean where all the ocean<br>basins connect that's where all the<br>music kind of happens that's where kind<br>of the exchange of carbon um kind of<br>happens and and where the temperature<br>gradients gets set and right in the<br>middle of that southern ocean is my<br>favorite continent<br>Antarctica so I started to ask myself<br>the question what makes up that big<br>continent what are the Rocks underne all<br>that ice how did all that ice get on top<br>of the continent how much of it is there<br>and what happens if we meld it what does<br>that do to our circulation of our oceans<br>what does that do to sea level so all<br>these questions were questions which<br>motivated me to applo to sail on this<br>kind of particular drilling Expedition<br>2010 so I want to take you on that<br>Journey which is partially my own<br>Journey how I came to Antarctic study um<br>but it will be a lot Journey on looking<br>at Antarctica looking at what it looks<br>like today what it looked like in the<br>past and what it might look like in the<br>future and think about that in the<br>context of all of our future as<br>well before I start um I just want to<br>spend um a little while um making the<br>point that all this work always is a<br>massive team effort I might have the<br>privilege to send here to tonight and to<br>present to you but it's only thanks to<br>having worked with like many many many<br>outstanding people and this light just<br>makes a start to kind of show some of<br>them there's many wonderful<br>undergraduate graduate students who<br>worked with me over the years there's<br>people who inspired me 20 years back now<br>to even start thinking about<br>Antarctica um and then as we're talking<br>about drilling Expeditions um you can<br>see at the bottom here kind of pictures<br>from the three drilling Expeditions I've<br>been part of so far and as you heard in<br>the introduction as well there's a force<br>one coming up and I will talk about that<br>towards the end of the lecture all of<br>this work we're doing is a massive team<br>effort um no person is an iseland and<br>could do it on their own it's an<br>interdisiplinary effort and we all<br>benefit and learn from each other and<br>there so with this um I want to start Us<br>in the Here and Now with a bit of a<br>motivation so when we look at our<br>planet today we know that it has warmed<br>and it has warmed quite considerably um<br>since the onset of the Industrial<br>Revolution in the 19th century so on<br>this slide you can see um the<br>temperature normally and um the warming<br>we've observed today is a bit more than<br>a degree of um Centigrade already and<br>you can see that that warming is very<br>pronounced in the red colors kind of at<br>the poles and it's a bit more pronounced<br>over the continents than over the ocean<br>ocean when we think about the<br>consequences of the global average<br>temperature going up we often get kind<br>of shown picture collages like this one<br>so impacts of warming very often kind of<br>get Illustrated in terms of extreme<br>weather events you can see wildfires um<br>droughts um floodings kind of extreme<br>kind of storm systems and melting of ice<br>and all of these pictures<br>are absolutely real but they feel a bit<br>distant to us as does global average<br>temperature none of us really feels<br>global average temperature what we feel<br>is what happens kind of close to us and<br>if none of these events we see on the<br>picture are close to us we might still<br>look at it and think global warming is<br>something which doesn't really affect<br>us and I think we all learned<br>particularly in the last 10 years or so<br>that that picture is changing and and um<br>I brought up uh one event here which has<br>probably been changing things for you<br>locally here um this is a picture from<br>earlier this year when uh the ex<br>tropical storm Gabrielle um stored over<br>the northern Island and there was<br>extreme rainfall 20 m per hour at the<br>peak it affected lots of kind of uh<br>infrastructure um it displaced people<br>people kind of weree without um homes um<br>energy in their homes for a long time<br>and it was um a very significant kind of<br>um Financial damage as well so it's<br>events like that which kind of show us<br>uh that kind of climate change is not a<br>thing of the future anymore it's here<br>now um and has arrived not every single<br>event like this naturally is a direct<br>consequence uh of climate change and I<br>give a link there to website which does<br>a really good job in attributing<br>individual events to whether they're<br>really are due due to the warming we<br>already observed or not but one thing we<br>all know for sure is that a warmer<br>atmosphere can hold more water so more<br>extreme rainfall will always be a<br>consequence in in a warmer climate and<br>will be with us kind of going into the<br>future when we think about the flooding<br>that was caused in this case by this<br>extreme kind of rainfall event um one<br>thing we also have to think about is sea<br>level rise and we know that seas are<br>rising in the context of warming a lot<br>of it is due to the thermal expansion of<br>the ocean and melting of mountain<br>glaciers um and that brings with it some<br>increased flooding risks as well and I<br>show here a nice cartoon uh from the New<br>Zealand sea rice project uh which is um<br>hosted at the Antarctic Research Center<br>as well uh which shows at the bottom<br>that when we bring up kind of the Seas<br>kind of from a base level a bit higher<br>um obviously that increases our chances<br>of flooding but then if we are in an<br>area where the land for example is<br>subsiding which around New Zealand uh<br>can be observed in many places as well<br>that makes s even worse so what this<br>project has produced which I find um<br>absolutely inspiring and I wish um we<br>should do something like that in the UK<br>as well is that you can go online you<br>can click on your own Coastline and see<br>what your stretch of land is actually<br>doing and what the future in terms of<br>sea level rise looks at that location<br>but I want to go one step further now<br>and Link it all to Antarctica so I sat<br>the sea level rise a lot of it is due to<br>kind of Thal expansion of the ocean<br>right now a lot of it is due to um<br>Mountain glaciers retreating and this is<br>just one picture here um from South<br>America the Kaya ice cap you will find<br>something similar in the Southern Alps<br>as well if you look there but the big<br>joint in the whole sea level equation<br>really is our polar ice caps um so today<br>we have about 7 m worth of sea level<br>equivalent of water tied up as ice on<br>top of<br>Greenland and there's about 58 m in<br>total on<br>Antarctica and I divided Antarctica here<br>into a smaller western part and a a<br>larger Eastern part and um we'll see<br>kind of in the next slide while we'll do<br>that so let's see where that animation<br>actually plays<br>now it does<br>wonderful um so we're looking here at a<br>record um of ice loss in Antarctica from<br>the year 2000 going up to the present<br>day so a 20year record so we're looking<br>at Mass loss and the line kind of moves<br>forward here in this record and as the<br>line moves forward you can see on the<br>continent um showing up in yellow and<br>then red and dark red colors areas where<br>the mass loss of eyes is observed and<br>that's observations from satellites um<br>today and you can see as this record<br>moves on that one area in West<br>Antarctica starts standing out very very<br>pronouncedly and that's the area of the<br>Amon sea um around the tws I um and Pine<br>Island Glacier systems you will probably<br>all have heard around so when we get to<br>the end of that record now we see a lot<br>of mass loss in West anarctica and we<br>can see relatively little Mass loss in<br>in the bigger part of East anarctica so<br>again East anarctica holds around 53<br>meters wor of sea level so that's if you<br>think in London terms all the way up to<br>the clock of big band that's normally<br>how we think about easn arctic uh ice<br>volume um West Antarctica the 5 MERS is<br>not even the diameter of the clock of<br>Big Ben um that's 5 m so this is what<br>the situation kind of looks like at the<br>moment and I want to spend one slide on<br>explaining<br>why that is because we have a pretty<br>good understanding these days why that<br>is and that goes back to kind of<br>thinking a bit about the Rocks<br>underneath the ice so if we remove all<br>the ice that sits on the continent today<br>um that's what the continent would look<br>like the yellow to brown colors are bits<br>of the continent which are above sea<br>level and the blue areas are areas which<br>are below sea level so we can see pretty<br>much all of West anarctica is showing up<br>as blue here so it's below sea level and<br>that's what we call Marine based ice so<br>the ice sheet there is in direct contact<br>with the ocean in contrast East<br>anarctica most of it is actually above<br>sea level and um there's some little<br>cartoons to the right here the reason<br>why a marine based oil sheet is so much<br>more vulnerable to potential melting<br>like we observe it today in the<br>satellite record is that the ice sheet<br>kind of ends in a floating ice shelf and<br>that ice shelf can basically um when<br>it's on a shelf where warm Waters<br>intrudes underneath it be eaten up not<br>just from above but also from below so<br>you get basically get heat working on it<br>from two angles and once you lose that<br>buttressing ice shelf you can kind of<br>collapse the ice in the hinterland and<br>we know from observational data that<br>kind of heat into form of warm water is<br>actually coming to the shores of West<br>Antarctica as you can see at the bottom<br>here was the pink to Red colors um<br>exactly in those areas where we can see<br>loss so let's do a little summary what<br>we got so far um the observation is that<br>anarctica is losing mass um as the<br>planet is<br>warming the concern now is that of<br>course many of us live close to the<br>shorelines there's a growing kind of<br>global population of people who live<br>close to the Sea and understanding what<br>lies ahead of us in terms of sea Lev R<br>is actually really<br>important the solution I want to offer<br>obviously as you can tell from from the<br>title of my talk is that we can use the<br>geological past now and use the drill<br>record we have um to understand what<br>might lie ahead of us and that's what<br>we're going to do now and in order to<br>kind of um get your mindset into the<br>right time periods I want to talk about<br>in the geological past we can start was<br>a kind of modern thermometer and this<br>thermometer is colored in now in terms<br>of temperatures our planet might reach<br>in the next 100 years so the green areas<br>here are basically warming up to 1 and a<br>half degrees yellow is up to 2° and then<br>we go to three four and<br>5° so the nations of the world agreed<br>that we should try to keep warming below<br>2° ideally below 1.5° and that's kind of<br>the green and yellow Parts here but the<br>reality the basically trajectory we are<br>currently on as enshrined in law is um<br>the blue box here so we're currently on<br>a trajectory to warming by the end of<br>this Century of 2.7 de so there's still<br>a bit of a difference between our<br>ambition uh and what we're doing right<br>now but we can use now Earth's history<br>because in Earth's history it has been<br>warmer in the past as well and find<br>basically temperature analog times for<br>for any of these future times so if we<br>look at warming of 1 to 1 and A2 de C so<br>the kind of range we ideally want to be<br>in we can look at a time period called<br>the last interglacial some<br>125,000 years ago and if we want to look<br>at what the trajectory we're currently<br>on with 3 to 4° uh degrees warming or<br>would look like we can look at a period<br>called The Plum warm time so in very<br>simple terms we can kind of step back<br>into time um kind of use follow our<br>Footprints here and study Antarctica<br>responds to these sorts of<br>temperatures and that's exactly what I<br>want to show you now so we go back to<br>that expedition that beautiful picture I<br>showed you in the beginning um and that<br>expedition was um an iodp Expedition<br>which sailed actually out of Wellington<br>uh here in 2010 that was my first time I<br>came to visit uh we sailed on on this<br>beautiful Dro ship Major's resolution<br>and um we came out of Wellington down to<br>the shores of East anarctica and then<br>back into Australia and you could see on<br>the picture probably just about kind of<br>my orange hair and if you look very<br>carefully two people next to me is a<br>probably much younger version of the<br>current director of the Antarctic<br>Research Center as well Rob maai who was<br>on that expedition as well and that's<br>where we first met and collaborated ever<br>since so what is it like like to sail<br>down there um if you haven't<br>been if you get seasick I recommend you<br>don't go um the Southern Ocean is is<br>very much known for its high waves<br>there's strong winds going across and<br>that is just a view standing at the the<br>back end of the ship and yes that's a<br>wave and not a m nonland or so um I very<br>much like it I you know go up to the<br>bridge and enjoy the high waves but um I<br>can tell you there was a lot of people<br>pretty sick during that Crossing um what<br>is really cool is once you kind of get<br>to a certain degree kind of beyond the<br>Southern Ocean uh it calms down quite<br>dramatically and that's what the view<br>looked like um you can see the easn<br>Arctic ice sheet in the background here<br>some grounded icebergs the foreground um<br>during the couple of hours where the sun<br>went a bit lower and then up again and<br>um the next slide is what it looked like<br>during the day shift so that's my<br>favorite picture because I was working<br>on the day shift and this is what it<br>looks like like when you know it's kind<br>of time to go home so kind of towards<br>the end of February early March this is<br>what the beginning of Ci's formation<br>looks<br>like so what did we get on this<br>Expedition um the expedition was a real<br>gold mine for all kinds of things and I<br>just want to touch on the two time<br>periods I introduced the P scene and<br>then this last interglacial time period<br>so up here is the mut we recovered from<br>the P scene um it was a time period as I<br>said 3 to 5 million years ago<br>CO2 in the atmosphere back then was not<br>too dissimilar to what we have right now<br>so we're currently at 420 PPM um the<br>range kind of was between 350 and 450<br>PPM back then but global temperatures<br>were quite a bit warmer so that's the<br>equilibrium response of the system to<br>that sort of greenhouse gas forcing in<br>the atmosphere 2 and a half to 4 degre<br>and interestingly if we look at Global<br>sea level and we can kind of reconstruct<br>that for looking at shorelines around<br>the continents that was quite a bit<br>higher 10 to 25<br>M and if we now think about where that<br>sea level comes from uh there's some<br>kind of interesting sinking to be done<br>so in the P scene we're seeing probably<br>most of Greenland uh would have deated<br>so that's 5 to 7 meters of sea level we<br>think that probably most of West<br>anarctica has delated 3 to 5 m of sea<br>level but that's still just about guess<br>that's slightly over 10 m uh and we know<br>some from some other work um done here<br>in New Zealand as well that just the<br>amplitude of sea level change during<br>that time was around 30 m or so so we<br>probably actually look for some<br>contribution from easn<br>Arctica so how do we get that how do we<br>get that evidence and this is my one<br>slide of not talking about isotope<br>geochemistry but explaining the<br>principle behind it so what we basically<br>do is um we just look at the chemical f<br>fingerprint of the mud and scent will<br>recover from the bottom of the ocean and<br>the idea there is that like with our<br>fingerprints or our DNA every Rock<br>basically is quite unique depending on<br>how old it is and how it's um composed<br>and so any rocks on the continent when<br>you erode them grind them down and<br>deposit them in the ocean they they<br>don't change certain chemical signatures<br>so you can trace that signature back so<br>if you have a drill course say here in<br>the ocean and you go back in time you<br>hit that red layer you can from the<br>chemical fingerprint and say that that<br>layer is the same stuff as The Rock all<br>the way in land here so our<br>interpretation then would be that you<br>have to retreat the ice margin all the<br>way till you Roe that R Red Rock and<br>bring it out to the ocean so it's around<br>a few corners but it's basically using<br>chemical fingerprints in the sediments<br>to learn where the ice margin<br>was to do that you need quite fancy<br>Laboratories and um I just wanted to to<br>share some of the pictures of um our<br>wonderful and uh worldclass Laboratories<br>we have at imperal College in our mass<br>spectrometry and isotope geochemistry<br>group in Earth Science and<br>Engineering so what did we find um it's<br>one of I think only two slides with<br>Wiggly lines so ignore the wiggly lines<br>on it um this is basically a graph of<br>the sediments we recovered for this kind<br>of Pline warm period and from the<br>sediments from the look of the sediments<br>we can kind of say there were warmer<br>times there were colder times in there<br>and I marked up the warmer times in this<br>pink bends here in this sequence and on<br>the right hand side is the chemical<br>fingerprints we measured and all you<br>need to take away from that is is that<br>there are systematic variations um the<br>chemical fingerprint goes back and forth<br>and it does so together with warmer and<br>colder times so it kind of<br>correlates and here's the headline of<br>the paper we published from that we kind<br>of concluded that you have a very<br>Dynamic Behavior off the Eastern Arctic<br>ice sheet margin in that area and the<br>reason why we saw that is we looked more<br>carefully um at the geology under the<br>eyes and compared the different<br>fingerprints and we figured that during<br>colder time intervals our drill site the<br>Southern Ocean is to the top of the<br>slide now um looks like the Rocks kind<br>of in really coastal areas around the<br>ninus glacier um and that is very much<br>what we see today as well but then<br>during warmer times it's very different<br>so the kind of yellow to Green areas are<br>deep subg glacial basins in this part of<br>eastn Arctica and we think that the ice<br>margin retreated quite a bit on land um<br>until you get that kind of ly which I<br>gave the green color here and you shed<br>that material all the way out to the<br>shelf so again repeated advances and<br>Retreats of the ice in this area the Ws<br>sub glacial<br>Basin so I put this cartoon in there to<br>give me a minute to kind of pause<br>actually because when we kind of<br>published that paper and found those<br>results that was actually quite a big<br>deal it was something we didn't quite<br>expect for that area and I want to<br>reiterate why we didn't quite expect it<br>on this cartoon so um a continental<br>based I sheet is an ice sheet which sits<br>on Bedrock above sea level and we saw<br>most of eastn Arctica is of that nature<br>on the other hand on the left of this<br>diagram here a marine based ey sheet<br>like West Antarctica sits on Bedrock<br>below sea level and that is kind of a<br>lot easier to melt so that was our kind<br>of General starting<br>point but if we go back now at the map I<br>showed you earlier where we remove all<br>the ice from the continent you can see<br>that there is quite a few areas in<br>eastern Tica which have blue colors as<br>well so Eastern Tica has basic basically<br>quite a bit of marine based ice as well<br>and if we add all of that up that's<br>about 19 M worth of marine based ice and<br>The Wil sub glacial Basin where we drill<br>so the sty our drill side is one of<br>those areas there's two others the<br>Aurora and the recovery Basin which<br>definitely kind of require a lot of<br>attention as well so in that sense not<br>too surprising we we just basically<br>drilled in front of these areas which is<br>quite vulnerable as<br>well does that conform with any other<br>evidence from the area I put another<br>kind of star on the map here so if we<br>just go around the corner into the Ros<br>SE area it actually nicely links up to<br>some uh phenomenal work which um was<br>done some years before with the Andra<br>project and again that was a project<br>which was heavily driven out of uh the<br>Antarctic Research Center as well and um<br>deployed the first kind of geological<br>drilling that was ever done from an ey<br>shelf as a platform so there's a lot of<br>really impressive engineering going on<br>there um so drill rck was put kind of on<br>the floating ey shelf and then the long<br>sediment record was recovered and when<br>we look at that sediment record I'm just<br>focusing in on this pene time here<br>there's kind of these sick yellow units<br>in in the sediments and what those units<br>were were basically Marine algae um so<br>you can see the picture at the top there<br>in green layers and what they signalize<br>is that you had B basically open ocean<br>conditions at the side so they sat<br>around the corner in the Ros sea you had<br>open Marine conditions the I shelf was<br>gone and at the bottom you can see a<br>simulation from an ey sheet model which<br>kind of says well you probably looked at<br>a collapsed West an Arctic ice sheet and<br>that's why you see open ocean<br>conditions this is what kind of a modern<br>situation looked like and this is a more<br>expanded situation but what I want to<br>pay attention to is um zooming in here<br>again uh the side from the Ros SE and<br>our new drill site this particular eyes<br>sheet model back then when it was<br>published doesn't show any ice retreat<br>in the area I just talked about so this<br>is why kind of people weren't initially<br>uh fully convinced um about our results<br>um but I think it triggered a really<br>really nice dialogue between I sheep<br>models and data producing people which<br>has been ongoing uh ever since and<br>started before that already so it's not<br>that we are the first but there's a<br>really good into play now and I kind of<br>just show a picture here of what I call<br>the old P scene so that's what the the<br>models kind of sought the pene look like<br>and then you can see at the bottom here<br>if you kind of think a little bit uh<br>about like the physics and the models<br>and some processes you can put in this<br>is just one kind of output how a new P<br>scene could look like and you could see<br>big kind of ice Retreat now in the area<br>where we observed it with our records as<br>well so that's kind of the P scene done<br>I want to take you one step further and<br>have a look at the P scene now because<br>that is now the time analog where<br>temperatures are pretty much in the<br>range where we are to today already so<br>we're just looking at a couple degrees<br>warmer than<br>pre-industrial during that time sea<br>level globally was dependent on which of<br>these interl in the lake P scene we look<br>at 5 to 1 M higher than today if we just<br>look at the last interglacial maybe 5 to<br>10 met or so so if we play our game<br>again and think about where is that sea<br>level coming from well in this case um<br>there has to be some ice left on<br>Greenland because we have ice cores<br>which actually go back to that age and<br>particularly the last inter glacial so<br>we're probably only looking at a couple<br>of meters out of<br>Greenland West Antarctica well most<br>people think West anarctica probably was<br>gone so again we look at 3 to 5 m we can<br>add like a meter for some normal<br>expansion and Mountain glacial melting<br>um so if you add all of this up you kind<br>of get there already so you don't<br>necessarily need like a huge easn Arctic<br>um composition or<br>contribution um but we saw well we seem<br>to have the perfect drill site now let's<br>have a look and see whether East an<br>Arctica did something there as well and<br>to cut a long story short um I show you<br>kind of the second wiggly line of the<br>day so basically our chemical<br>fingerprints and our sediment from the<br>last 500,000 years at that drill side<br>co-varied nicely with temperature as<br>well and actually indicated that we had<br>ice loss as well and that is kind of<br>really highlighted in in this graph so<br>in the middle is our record of the<br>chemical fingerprint going back and<br>forth again and it's plotted here with a<br>global sea level curve at the top and<br>local temperatures in Antarctica at the<br>bottom and what we basically found is if<br>you put the local local temperature<br>above a certain threshold and in this<br>case it's about 2° locally that's not<br>global average temperature that's local<br>temperature in<br>Antarctica then you start getting<br>Retreat of the ice margin into the W sub<br>glacial Basin so that that was really<br>kind of um a big finding so let's<br>summarize some answers I said I will'll<br>talk about some questions and some<br>answers to my talk today um we found<br>quite a few answers from that<br>Expeditions and there's many more um I<br>don't touch on today the low-lying areas<br>of the eastn Arctic I sheet in the work<br>sub glacial Basin contributed to sea<br>level rise and they did so not only<br>during the pine warm period which many<br>of us might have expected they also did<br>so for the late place to see when<br>temperatures only were a couple degrees<br>warmer so one way how I often summarize<br>this is by plotting up global<br>temperatures on the x-axis and then sea<br>level on the Y axis we put like big<br>boxes because there's big uncertainties<br>on all of this there for our paleo time<br>periods and we can see kind of uh the<br>sea level that would have corresponded<br>to the warming of the pene and the pene<br>on the left hand side I give you here<br>all our components of ice that's quite<br>vulnerable to to warming temperatures<br>the Western an Arctic the Greenland and<br>the Marine based parts of East anarctica<br>together that's about 30<br>m when we look at projections where sea<br>level would go by the end of this<br>Century um they are in the range of 20<br>cm to a meter and you don't need to be a<br>scientist to realize that that kind of<br>blue line at the bottom here doesn't<br>fully align with what we see from the<br>geological<br>past so the message here is and that has<br>been nicely put together in the recent<br>report from the intergovernmental panel<br>on climate change the message really is<br>that see level rise is a slow response<br>to warming and it's a response that will<br>go on for hundreds to thousands of years<br>into the future so whatever we're doing<br>right now we're not seeing the full<br>consequence of that and in the report<br>they kind of summarized this in in boxes<br>for one and a half to 4 degrees warming<br>and um you probably can't quite read it<br>but on the left hand side that would be<br>the sea level rise you get after 2,000<br>years on the right and size after 10,000<br>years so that's way beyond our lifetimes<br>but that's kind of the commitments we<br>are making today and if you go basically<br>from here the best case scenario that<br>looks at 2 meters of sea level rise all<br>the way over to the right that gets us<br>into the 30 MERS I mentioned we have<br>available in vulnerable<br>eyes so a critical question then is how<br>much and how fast how much sea Lev rise<br>will we get and how fast will it happen<br>and that critically depends on two sinks<br>it depends on our own actions it depends<br>on the future emissions we still put<br>into the atmosphere and the warming that<br>creates but it also depends um on some<br>of our scientific understanding in terms<br>of the ice sheet responses so when we<br>look at projections for sea level rice<br>at the moment everybody agrees that the<br>biggest uncertainty is that we don't<br>exactly know what happens with<br>Antarctica so it's still something um we<br>need kind of to work on and I want to<br>focus on on that last question which<br>leads me into the final bit of my talk<br>uh which is the question kind of whether<br>the West an Arctic ey sheet actually<br>collapsed in the most recent past when<br>it was just a couple degrees warmer than<br>today so it's an hypothesis which was<br>postulated back in the 1970s that that<br>would happen and there's like 45 years<br>worth of science now looking into this<br>and the Hest answer is that we still<br>don't have any data which tell us<br>whether the West an Arctic I sheet did<br>collapse when it was a couple degrees<br>warmer than today or not what we do have<br>is a lot of very sophisticated numerical<br>models which predict that that kind of<br>will happen at some point but if you<br>look at different snapshots of models<br>here the output actually can vary quite<br>a bit you can get like an open Seaway<br>kind of under warming of a couple of<br>degrees you can get like a situation<br>where you just get like a bigger area<br>and the Ross sea that opens up or on the<br>right hand side you can get a situation<br>where the amonson sea area which is<br>melting fast today opens up but the Ross<br>sea pretty much stays the same and all<br>these different solutions actually have<br>implications and it's quite important to<br>figure out what we are looking<br>at so in a moment of frustration I asked<br>chat GPT so I was coming probably out of<br>a faculty meeting at work and thinking<br>like how do we deal with teaching our<br>students when they asked all these<br>artificial chat box everything so I<br>asked chat dut what you<br>know when did the West an Arctic ey<br>sheet last collapse and Chad jpt and I<br>should qualify here that was in February<br>2023 so it was when it kind of just you<br>know was out brand new and it gave me a<br>very certain and very quick answer the<br>most recent collapse of the western<br>Arctic I sheet occurred about 10,000<br>years ago total rubbish okay so I was<br>like good okay CH GPT doesn't have a<br>clue I I I did ask it yesterday again<br>and and that's kind of you know the<br>scary bit we all have to get our heads<br>around it learns really really fast<br>because every time we ask it it kind of<br>you know figures out that there is<br>something to be learned um so it says<br>now that um its knowledge is limited to<br>January 22 so like if I know something<br>since then of course it can't know that<br>um uh there was probably no recent full<br>collapse of the West an Arctic I sheet<br>but you know it realizes it's really a<br>topic of concern we should think about<br>it and if you really want to know you<br>should basically talk to a scientist and<br>figure out from them what their kind of<br>news inside is great so conclusion here<br>it's still up to us um to go and find<br>that all kind of elusive evidence for<br>when the west and Arctic I sheet last<br>collapsed and that's exactly the<br>Expeditions uh we're going to set off U<br>well I'm going to set off next week uh<br>some other people are well on their way<br>already um and the project is the S to<br>see project which stands for the<br>sensitiv of the western Arctic I sheet<br>to two degrees warming so that's the<br>Paris um uh agreement Target the world<br>set out and you heard in the<br>introduction there's kind of you know 10<br>different countries involved in this uh<br>lots of funding agencies institutions uh<br>InterContinental uh drilling kind of um<br>program giving giving us funding for<br>that so it's a huge International effort<br>to actually set off uh and and answer<br>that question what we are trying to do<br>is we're trying to go to two drill sides<br>shown here as as the r kind of dots um<br>on the Eastern side of the Ross ey shelf<br>so we're looking basically at that<br>interface where the floating eye shelf<br>goes over into the grounded eye sheet<br>our first drill site will be um close to<br>the grounding zone of the comp ice<br>stream and the second one is over here<br>at the CR Ice Race um we are operational<br>right now the Traverse team is on the<br>way to kind of bring kind of our<br>equipment to the sign along hopefully<br>this blue dotted line somewhere I didn't<br>check this morning where they are now um<br>some of the Camp staff and Engineers um<br>kind of tried to fly out from Christ<br>church this morning I heard they<br>boomeranged but you know they will try<br>to fly out tomorrow again um and<br>hopefully uh myself and others will then<br>get down there kind of next week and<br>we'll fly to Scot base and from there<br>into our Deep Field side so what we'll<br>do uh and again there's amazing kind of<br>um development<br>uh design and build involved here coming<br>out of the Antarctic Research Center uh<br>we're going to melt a 30 cm Hol through<br>the Ross ice shelf then there's a bit of<br>an ocean cavity underneath and then<br>we'll deploy a brand new sediment coring<br>system the a system which has been<br>designed and built specifically for this<br>project we all really hope that it goes<br>well because if it does its technology<br>which could be used for a lot of other<br>projects as well so there's a lot of<br>fantastic um development that has been<br>going in into this and our goal is at<br>both sides to drill up to 200 M of<br>sediment and bring that back and learn<br>from that what actually<br>happened so here's the approach very<br>similar to what was done with the Andra<br>project just that we are now far far<br>away from a base we are 800 kilm away we<br>have a lightweight drill wig uh we can<br>transport there and do it at a lot lower<br>costs uh than has been done before so<br>wishes luck um it's a really really<br>exciting project by just getting set<br>sents again we'll see were we in the<br>situation under an ice shelf like today<br>in a situation where it was colder with<br>grounded ice or did we encounter open<br>Marine kind of conditions with kind of<br>you know algam Mats like we've seen in<br>the pene and the under<br>side so one of the questions we really<br>want to get kind of um to is when will<br>we lose the rosze shelf and I want to<br>finish with that question because there<br>was recently some work published which<br>has gotten a lot of media attention um<br>from the amonson sea area so that was an<br>area where modeling work was done which<br>basically showed that the warming and<br>the ice loss we're seeing there at the<br>moment already reached one of these<br>points of no return so it's already<br>irreversible um no matter whether we<br>stop emitting more CO2 tomorrow and stop<br>kind of warming from happening so um the<br>conclusion of the paper was that the ice<br>in this area the Amon sea basically is<br>going to be lost no matter what we do<br>and I think some of us really looked at<br>that and said well that's quite a bleak<br>message and it is important that<br>scientists openly speak the truth what<br>they find but we looked at our area here<br>the rust sea we are going to and um as<br>you can see from this map again here<br>which is basically the temperatures<br>around the margin of the West an Arctic<br>ice sheet the Russ SE is in a very<br>different situation we don't have warm<br>Waters coming underneath the rosy Shelf<br>at the moment um like we do in the Amon<br>sea so there's cold water in the cavity<br>and that kind of potentially makes a<br>huge huge difference and on the right<br>hand side here you can see um some<br>modeling work done by scientists at the<br>arc and at gns which shows that yes if<br>we go down in the future on a low<br>emission pathway so we keep two keeping<br>warming below two degrees uh we might<br>lose the tws glacier but if you look at<br>the Ros sea uh that area doesn't show<br>red colors so we could still save the<br>Ross ey shelf and that butresses a lot<br>of the West Antarctic ice sheet so that<br>means we not committed to losing the<br>entire Western an Arctic ice sheet if<br>you go down a high emission passway in<br>country the Ross I sheet starts showing<br>up um in red colors as well so there's<br>really important messages here and we<br>really have to ask the question to the<br>geological record to figure out what<br>happens in that area and we just put out<br>um a story in the conversation two days<br>ago for those of you who want to learn a<br>bit more about<br>that so with this um I'm coming to my<br>end and I want to go back to the<br>pictures I started off with on on my own<br>Journey kind of you know coming from the<br>countryside and and evolving and<br>becoming the scientist I am right now um<br>there's a lot to be grateful for and I'm<br>particularly grateful and excited about<br>setting foot kind of an anarctica next<br>week it's just the sea ice it's kind of<br>you know the ice shelf it's not really<br>the continent but um I've been on ships<br>around the continent a lot it will be an<br>absolute pleasure to go and visit it for<br>the first time and what really gives me<br>hope for that white continent is that<br>the future of it really still is in our<br>hands there might be bits of it which<br>kind of reach tipping points already we<br>can't do anything about anymore but<br>there's definitely big parts of it where<br>we still have a lot of say in how the<br>future evolution will go with our<br>Behavior going forward and I want to<br>finish with a quote from Amanda Gorman<br>which is change is made of choices and<br>choices are made of<br>character and I want to use that quote<br>to just say that not all the people on<br>this planet um actually have the means<br>to make choices and that it's really up<br>to us who have the means to make the<br>right choices and show the right actions<br>thank<br>you<br>Oto I'm Rob Mai director of tuna the<br>antartic research center<br>ater and it's my great pleasure to um<br>you give a thank you for that that that<br>talk Tina was um you know thank Tina um<br>for you know explain this this I I've<br>seen this journey quite a few times but<br>explain a really riveting journey I was<br>already riveted throughout that even<br>though I've seen a lot of that data<br>myself um just that relevance towards<br>the future as well that you could use<br>this past High sheet change but then<br>clearly tie it into what are the<br>implications for this for us in the<br>future and how can we potentially still<br>decide what that future will be so I<br>first met Tina and 13 years ago in 2010<br>the expedition that Tina pointed out and<br>um she said it was her first time she'<br>come to the Southern Hemisphere and one<br>of the things that she had kind of<br>overlooked on that she's very famous for<br>her red hair and um but she was red all<br>over she' um she's a world expert as you<br>can tell from that talk she's a world<br>expert in the oceans a world expert in<br>the ey sheets but she had forgotten<br>about the atmospheric processes of the<br>ozone hole so um she has been very very<br>careful on this trip to um sunscreen<br>first thing in the morning when she<br>wakes up and I'm sure you'll be doing<br>that down the ice where it gets even<br>more<br>extreme<br>now as antartic geologists you know<br>Drillers so we had had a lot of<br>experience in the enti research center<br>around doing drilling of the Continental<br>shelves and looking at that physical<br>footprint of the I sitting down so the<br>sedimentology that Tina showed um very<br>very nicely and summed up but what Tina<br>brought to the table and this is where I<br>really realized she<br>was a really diverse talent that was<br>really critical for Antarctica was<br>bringing these geochemical tools because<br>this allowed us to reach a part of the<br>ice sheet that was almost impossible to<br>do via those techniques of drilling<br>through ice sheets so this was um I<br>think you can tell from that talk this<br>was really revolutionary globally and<br>it's fundamentally changed the way we've<br>seen those ey sheets and how they might<br>project future sea rise that that will<br>affect us in New Zealand so that that<br>connection between people seen physical<br>change and we're seeing that today with<br>Coastal erosion around our<br>country now she did conclude with that<br>message that we do have a choice and<br>it's a very clear choice that we do need<br>to meet that Paris agreement Target<br>right that that's fundamental that 1.5<br>degree threshold really does appear to<br>be a threshold we will start to lose<br>those ey shelves and but it is a message<br>of hope we can slow down the rates and<br>saving the Ross ey shelf in particular<br>it's one of the key um key butching<br>points of that I sheet that will keep it<br>stable now I'm really excited to see<br>Tina traveling south to entire because<br>the first time as you say standing foot<br>in the continent it's very frustrating<br>being on a drill ship and not actually<br>being able to see the continent but not<br>actually be able to go and see all of<br>its it's wers so um as as Tina showed<br>it's a journey of Discovery um it's not<br>with without challenges right this is a<br>very ambitious project you know we've<br>never done this before um I'm just<br>really glad we have people like Tina<br>they're ready ready for that challenge<br>and actually going down there and taking<br>it on because it really does have<br>important implications for us all so on<br>behalf of toer and Walker and um to the<br>taret Research Center thank you again<br>for your talk and I I'll open the floor<br>questions<br>yes I get a microphone coming you thank<br>you hello um my name is Mary redm thank<br>you for your talk um I did honors in<br>Environmental Studies about 2009 so<br>about the time you first went to<br>Antarctica there was a lot of talk about<br>keeping it to below one degree um and<br>even then I thought this is a very<br>strange way of expressing it by<br>averaging because to most people a very<br>common response at the time was oh great<br>I'd love it to be a degree warmer um and<br>so it's very hard for many people to<br>understand the concept of an<br>average um Heating and the map you<br>showed right at the beginning I think is<br>a m speaks much more strongly especially<br>since a huge a huge number of<br>influential and rich people live in the<br>bit that's going to be warmest so<br>is there any sort of hope of getting<br>their message across with a map like<br>that or an indication that of which bits<br>are going to get most hotter sorry<br>sooner yeah thanks thanks for that<br>question<br>um I I think the Comm you touched on a<br>very important point of how we<br>communicate that and as as human species<br>is I think we're not good to reacting to<br>facts and numbers we're good um at<br>reacting to lift experiences um as I<br>tried to make the connection as well and<br>I think it's important to acknowledge<br>this global warming is not like a global<br>kind of feature which looks the same<br>everywhere as you nicely summarized it's<br>going to warm more over the poles and<br>that has to do with with the planetary<br>kind of balances um how temperatures<br>work on our planet and what we have to<br>as scientists look at that global<br>average number because that determines<br>the Baseline of how you shift the whole<br>system up and down and from which<br>certain processes then kick in like<br>extreme weather events or or other<br>things or it determines how much kind of<br>the warming water in the in the sea<br>expense<br>um how how we really bring that better<br>kind of to people what it means um I I<br>think it would be dangerous if we go<br>down and just say there's one area which<br>gets very hot typically that's the<br>Arctic right so don't you know try to<br>lift too close to there but you find if<br>you live say somewhere around the<br>equator um the the whole Baseline of the<br>system shifts as I said and so it will<br>affect all of us the question is just<br>when um and not if and I think that is<br>something important to keep in mind and<br>that we should not like sit back to wait<br>till we feel these extreme events and do<br>degrees<br>okay how many degrees would you do you<br>think it shifts per year on<br>um if we take<br>um the medium line where is where's the<br>what's that word<br>equator what how many what percentage<br>towards it's um it it probably Tails um<br>a bit back to the last question it's<br>it's not a very linear process and<br>there's many reasons there's many<br>feedbacks in the climate system which<br>make it um a process which you can't<br>from year-to-year track which is why<br>looking at 10 years worse of temperature<br>data can sometimes give a very<br>misleading record whether there's a<br>general Trend going on so you always<br>have to look over longer time<br>intervals we had so far a bit more than<br>a degree 1.1 or 1.2 degrees warming<br>since the 19th century so the Baseline<br>is typically 1850 to 1900 so we could do<br>the mass right so that's 120 years 1.2<br>de that gives you kind of the grade<br>um of of what the warming is kind of in<br>general doing but it is a direct<br>response of the CO2 in the atmosphere so<br>there's a direct physical connection<br>with how many greenhouse gases are in<br>the atmosphere and what warming that<br>kind of reacts to but the fact that it's<br>not always super linear has to do with<br>all the feedbacks in the climate system<br>which can kind of play a role I hope<br>um um so the the maximum we're hoping<br>for is is 200 meters that's the<br>specification of the the RC um I think<br>all of us agree any bit of sediment we<br>get from that location is a huge success<br>uh we're going somewhere where no human<br>beings have been before and recovered<br>sediment from uh they there is a lot of<br>and I uh quite honestly always call it a<br>bit of Geo fantasy going on we kind of<br>do very careful surveys at the sides and<br>of course we have ideas what we think<br>will recover at both of these sides uh<br>we we are hoping for something which is<br>kind of the last yeah five 10 million<br>years at at the first drill side most<br>certainly much older at the second drill<br>site where we probably go more to 20 30<br>million years as well we have to drill<br>to know whether that is true um I might<br>be standing here in two months time and<br>sat well you know we got something<br>totally different but we got something<br>and we can think about that now so<br>that's I think the situation I hope to<br>be<br>in<br>no no this this is probably the bit I<br>know least about um because it's a a<br>newly developed system uh I have not<br>seen it being operated it has been uh<br>tested in a quarry I know there's a<br>couple of people in the audience uh<br>including uh probably Rob who could<br>answer that much better um how long will<br>it take I me just look at Richard do you<br>idea we we've got about two 3 weeks to<br>drill 200 M and it will take as long as<br>it takes yeah it it's if it depends what<br>we're drilling if the if the rock is<br>soft and you can get uh I think each<br>time we run the the the the barrel that<br>collects the core it's about 3 and 1<br>half M most that most we can get and<br>then it takes a little bit of time to<br>pull it back up to the surface so um<br>when we're finished at the end of the<br>season we'll be able to tell you much<br>more clearly how long it<br>took<br>uh yeah thanks ten re Rex one um<br>here super interesting presentation I<br>guess just following on from that<br>question how long does it take to get<br>from the field work to you know the<br>analysis and published papers and then<br>do you have any sort of commentary in<br>terms of we've got cop 28 coming up um<br>key Global stock take that interplay<br>between the science ipcc reports and the<br>unfc process and um any sort of insights<br>on that and views on how that interplay<br>could improve as we get a better<br>understanding<br>thanks yeah um fantastic questions um so<br>the the time scale for getting getting<br>any sort of answers out results um I<br>would say there's kind of two extremes<br>right so if we go and you know we drill<br>sediment we find these kind of open<br>Marine Aly layers honestly if the draw<br>core comes up and we look at the ends of<br>it we'll probably be able to tell you uh<br>that we kind of drill one of these last<br>interglacials we have a microscope on<br>side if you know the people who are<br>Specialists and looking at the little<br>organisms in there can tell us exactly<br>what age it is we might come back from<br>the ice with a first order answer that's<br>hugely optimistic but that could happen<br>the the more realistic case where we get<br>kind of material where we don't see<br>immediately what it will tell us and we<br>have to go into my world and do the<br>chemical analysis we normally look at a<br>process of like a good year to two of<br>analysis bringing it together from<br>different angles we have a science team<br>of of more than 100 people who will<br>deploy all kinds of different methods we<br>work very carefully on Sample flows so<br>that we share the material and all work<br>together um but you know I would say if<br>after two or three years uh we kind of<br>you know have have solid evidence that's<br>I think what we get from most of these<br>drilling Expeditions for the first big<br>process yeah um I wish sorry that didn't<br>shouldn't come across um as desperate as<br>it sounded I sometimes wish we we have<br>um a a stronger kind of direct pass into<br>some of these negotiations and um I<br>can't hide that as scientist I'm<br>sometimes at loss what words and what<br>descriptions we have to use to make the<br>consequences of what we do clearer and<br>make people who are in positions to make<br>decisions understand that better and<br>understand and I'm saying that from a UK<br>Angle now that it's not just about the<br>next elections what policy decisions we<br>make um but that it's really our own<br>future and future of humanity we're kind<br>of playing with here um the planet Earth<br>will be fine I'm not worried about our<br>planets it's it's how we are getting on<br>with it all so um I think there's a lot<br>to be done to kind of work closer to<br>people who have understanding how to get<br>into that policy space and I know we<br>have colleagues who do that I might be<br>inclined to do that myself at some point<br>it's something I I find really really<br>important and sometimes going back to<br>the lab and just doing the measurements<br>is not cutting it anymore when the world<br>is not<br>you um I'm not sure quite how to word my<br>question but I'm just wondering the<br>relevance of volcanic activity on the<br>CO2 Admissions and what the comparison<br>would be from the plene era to modern<br>account the connectivity of the CO2 to<br>the temperatures you mean or yeah so um<br>during the pene um as the CO2 levels<br>were very similar to what we are now so<br>um CO2 as a greenhouse gas in the<br>atmosphere um has a direct warming<br>effect we call call that the plank<br>response uh so it's direct physics in<br>how more greenhouse gases basically keep<br>more of the longwave radiation that<br>comes of the Earth in our atmosphere and<br>don't allow it to go back to space and<br>that kind of direct warming effect we<br>can quantify really well um and and that<br>kind of then gets bounced into positive<br>and Ne negative feedback loops as well<br>uh which kind of double that direct<br>effect so we knew that basically for a<br>doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere um we<br>kind of can expect something in the<br>order of 3° of warming 2 to 4 deg um so<br>that is not exactly the pine analog but<br>it gives you a bit of an idea and these<br>These are numbers based on heart physics<br>of the system so they um they pretty<br>clear so that pene response when it was<br>2 to 4 degrees warmer that CO2 was um<br>you know about the same it is right now<br>that is kind of the natural equilibrium<br>response of the system and if you give<br>the system then thousands of years to<br>kind of react to that equilibrium you<br>get your C Level Up 10 to 20 M that's<br>just um yeah how the system kind of<br>reacts to these sorts of forcings I just<br>wondered is there more or less volcanic<br>then um volcanic activity is kind of a<br>intermittent forer as we call it so it's<br>when whenever you got a really strong<br>volcanic emission which goes all the way<br>up to the stratosphere and that's<br>important uh that goes all the way up<br>the Aerosoles can act as a cooling agent<br>so it leads to a couple degrees of<br>cooling uh when you have big volcanic<br>eruptions um for a few years so that's<br>the extent of how it can influence the<br>climate system um so you see it in our<br>observational record of the last 150<br>years you can make out big volcanic<br>eruptions like Mount P tuber in 199 21<br>you can see a blip in the temperature<br>record um but like you can't see it um<br>on the long-term record as a driver for<br>change thank you Tina so as you saw from<br>that last response she isn't expert in<br>the atmosphere so I I stand<br>corrected so I'll just like to thank you<br>once again for that fantastic lecture um<br>just a round of applause for that that<br>um<br>yeah</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
