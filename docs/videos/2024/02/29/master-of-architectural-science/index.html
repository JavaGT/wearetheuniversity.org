comfortable warm with<br>good ventilation and this Masters it's<br>very important to contribute to that<br>Improvement this continuous Improvement<br>and to essentially make accessible to<br>everyone great contribution to have<br>better buildings accessible to everyone<br>my name is Fabricio Kika I'm a doctor<br>and architecture I'm a building science<br>program director here in Victoria<br>the Masters in architecture of science<br>is essentially the science behind the<br>construction right and everything that<br>happens in the background that people<br>actually don't see but they are very<br>important for Beauties so the project<br>management is about the organization how<br>the projects go about so how people work<br>together how Architects interact with<br>engineers and all sorts of Consultants<br>contractors and subcontractors and the<br>sustainability side is about make the<br>Beauties have a lower environmental<br>impact or non-environment in fact<br>depends on how good and how deep the<br>project goes so these two things are<br>very very important to any professional<br>in the construction industry and it's<br>very important for us and we are very<br>proud about the fact that students have<br>this wide range of options within the<br>the master and Architectural science we<br>have courses which the name is the<br>future of the future of project<br>management the future of things that are<br>related to the construction and<br>essentially we are talking about what<br>will happen in the industry some of the<br>stuff that you're developing here are<br>not happening at the moment but we know<br>that they will we know that there will<br>be a demand for management in a digital<br>era we know there will be a demand much<br>higher for efficient sufficient and<br>sustainable buildings so those things we<br>are 100 sure that will keep increasing<br>in the future and we will see the<br>contribution of the master and<br>Architectural science in some years when<br>we've realized that all the management<br>is now digital all the buildings have a<br>higher requirement for building<br>performers and environmental impact so<br>those are the features that we are<br>producing here inside the Masters in<br>if you are working a mark in the<br>construction industry this program would<br>work very well for you we have two<br>measures you have a major in<br>sustainability and project management so<br>as long as you have some contact and<br>some expertise related to the<br>construction industry you're going to be<br>very welcome here in the program and of<br>course as well our students our Bachelor<br>students that can come directly to the<br>Masters one of the most important things<br>about this program is the fact that the<br>student can create their own final<br>project so they come to school with an<br>idea and a passion about project<br>management or sustainability or<br>ventilation or lighting and they are<br>allowed because of the structure of of<br>our program to develop the old project<br>and become an expert and have a unique<br>set of skus that nobody else gonna have<br>in the market you're going to be a<br>masters in that specific field and<br>because our Master is very flexible and<br>very wide and the knowledge that we have<br>here is very broad so the students have<br>a huge capacity to develop their own<br>passion in that specific field that they<br>love one of the best things about this<br>program is the fact that you're gonna be<br>here developing a project that you like<br>and gonna be very unique so that's very<br>good for you for your career and because<br>you talk about project management and<br>sustainability you can contribute to<br>climate change to reduce the environment<br>impact of beauties or you can contribute<br>to the other side of Industry to make<br>the construction the design and all the<br>relationships go more smooth in the<br>construction industry<br>foreign<br>thing is that the way that we design<br>this program we will allow students to<br>work so a lot of students finish their<br>bachelor's and they got very good jobs<br>and it's kind of tricky to think about<br>to come back to to school but if you<br>were watching this video and you think<br>about to upskill to get a better<br>possibility in your career this program<br>will change your life because you can<br>keep working and take the program as<br>well and you can explain to the company<br>that you are working for that you might<br>be addressing issues that the company is<br>working at the moment so it's a perfect<br>situation to improve your skills to keep<br>you focusing and controlling your own<br>career and more important when students<br>leave The Bachelor they have a wide<br>range of skus but they are not unique<br>their degrees are exactly the same but<br>when you become a masters in<br>architecture science you become unique<br>nobody else is going to have that skills<br>that you're developing here in the<br>campus and that is very very important<br>particularly if you want to go up in<br>your career you're going to develop a<br>set of skills that only you will have<br>foreign<br>is delivered through what we call block<br>teaching the block teaching is every<br>four weeks for three days and or you<br>have your classes in your activities<br>with your lectures also that is very<br>very important that this program is<br>delivered in one single year so in 12<br>months you get your Masters and that's<br>very very important because having a<br>master is going to actually speed up<br>your career progression so you might<br>have a good job now but having a master<br>would allow you to go faster in your<br>career and have a unique<br>set of skus that gonna actually be a big<br>differential in your career so it's very<br>beneficial one more year you're going to<br>be working and studying at the same time<br>and you're going to have a very very<br>great boost in your career<br>his side is related to make the beauty<br>more efficient so we can have students<br>live in the university and become like<br>an energy consultant to make the<br>building have a lower environment impact<br>related to energy or better ventilation<br>or better Acoustics everything related<br>to sustainability and the quality of the<br>indoor space these Masters allow the<br>students to have a wide range of<br>possibilities from project management<br>all the way through to sustainability to<br>efficiency of energy and Acoustics and<br>welcome is the capital of New Zealand<br>which is very important so it puts<br>together the government and the<br>university are very well connected and<br>New Zealand is a very open country it's<br>very good for international students who<br>have a lot of international students<br>here in our programs in the School of<br>Architecture so it's very welcoming<br>you're going to be in a city that is<br>safe it's very easy to navigate you can<br>walk around everywhere and you're going<br>to be very connected with different<br>communities for different parts of the<br>world very good to exchange information<br>knowledge we are in the Heart of the<br>City so this campus is in the middle of<br>the city and you're going to be<br>connecting government<br>very good<br>cultural life in a very walkable and<br>safe City<br>one of the most unique things about this<br>program is being inside the school of<br>architecture of the universe Victoria<br>University of Wellington because the<br>School of Architecture has all the<br>programs that cover everything about the<br>construction industry urban planning<br>architecture interior architecture<br>landscape and Architectural science so<br>the relationships that we are capable to<br>produce inside this campus is unique in<br>New Zealand so we're going to have<br>contact you can contribute to for<br>example urban planning or interior<br>architecture and that's something that<br>you cannot find anywhere else in New<br>Zealand we would love to have you here<br>as a student developing and improving<br>the building environment here in New<br>Zealand or any part of the world if you<br>want to know more about this program if<br>you're curious if you want to know if<br>your skills will match with the things<br>that we have in here you can contact us<br>or any other program that you want to<br>know about the School of Architecture of<br>Victoria University of Wellington just<br>send us an email or come to
