um Niti scafi<br>I'm I'm a firm member of the University<br>since my student days um and uh I stand<br>here to welcome you on behalf of the<br>university to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture where we celebrate<br>the achievements of Professor Conrad RoR<br>and achieving professorial<br>status<br>um um it is traditional to welcome<br>everyone here welcome to those members<br>of our university community uh from OT<br>denen those from our other campuses<br>particularly from in vagle at this<br>session uh members of the public from<br>denan and vagle and other places locally<br>um uh those from um wider a field those<br>that are joining us online from the<br>hallway far from the Four Winds and we<br>do have I understand people from all<br>continents of the world just about uh in<br>attendance today so uh it's great to see<br>um members of the public come up from in<br>Bago I understand to support Conrad<br>today uh Conrad says he is only 75%<br>nervous today or he's one of the members<br>of this of the of the staff that's 7 so<br>it's great to see fam comfortable and<br>familiar faces I'm sure for Conrad but I<br>do understand online there are some very<br>special guests and I'd like to um give<br>you a shout out Paul uh dialing in from<br>Melbourne uh Laura from Madrid uh cor<br>and Paul Henry Louisa and Amelia from<br>hidle Bank in Switzerland uh we have uh<br>professors from conr Network Martin ha<br>yansen and Cynthia from Santa Fe o Wingo<br>from New York Ti wadel from Keel ol<br>wedding and winred mner from Manna<br>Stefan rile from eer in Germany uh<br>Dorothy Kern from Boston and<br>Massachusetts uh some doctor colleagues<br>Nicholas Otto from Hal and Germany with<br>Walter<br>esberger um Mari Fifer and Yin from<br>inago Rodney and the Russ family from<br>Christ Church Andor Tasmania so welcome<br>welcome Thrice welcome to everyone um<br>this is a celebration and it's an<br>academic celebration which is why those<br>of us in the academic party pan AAL and<br>come out to join you uh acknowledging<br>this promotion to our highest academic<br>status in the University um professorial<br>appointment or promotion is something we<br>take very seriously we have special<br>committees that uh assess promotions we<br>use international referees to ensure<br>that standards are met at the level<br>expected from the top universities and<br>internationally and we require multiple<br>things we require Excellence of course<br>we require sustained Excellence but in<br>particular we look for leadership a and<br>uh leadership and excellence in the<br>areas of teaching research and service<br>and we value each of those as much as<br>the other and that forms the academic<br>triangle that we look to find someone<br>who fulfills the um the characteristics<br>that we expect of a professor in those<br>three areas and Conrad as we will hear<br>tonight uh we have a clinical academic<br>who has met those standards uh very very<br>admirably particularly in a significant<br>role in clinical teaching in Academia<br>where I think his own words himself is<br>that teaching is great because it's<br>learning twice and I can reflect on that<br>until you teach something you truly<br>don't understand it and then teaching<br>again and again reinforces your own<br>learning he as well as an active<br>practitioner a researcher and he and a<br>university leader in an important<br>satellite campus for us um Professor<br>bexter will give us a more detailed um<br>introduction to his career to date but<br>what I admire in um some of the overview<br>that Conrad as providers is a statement<br>that for many people particularly those<br>with professional roles as well as<br>academic roles uh that academic triangle<br>extends to a multi-point polygon we<br>might say and denen it could even be an<br>octagon and uh that extension of<br>teaching research and service into other<br>areas of family life professional life<br>um hobbies and other parts of someone's<br>rich and complex lives as the number of<br>vertices in those polygons grow the<br>interactions grow exponentially so I<br>think what we'll see tonight from Conrad<br>is a highly proficient clinician<br>academic researcher family member friend<br>colleague and uh a well-rounded person<br>that uh we are very very proud to have<br>as a member of our professor at the<br>University I would like to offer on<br>behalf of the University our sincere<br>congratulations for this promotion but<br>also given your professional area and<br>how much um your work will have touched<br>the lives of many<br>families um I would like to thank you<br>personally and on behalf of the many<br>families that your professional<br>activities have um helped um that we<br>deeply appreciate the work that you do<br>so please Jo join me as I ask Professor<br>beex to come and give a more detailed<br>introduction in offering our sincere<br>congratulations to Professor rcta on<br>done<br>well cure to everyone um my name is Joe<br>Baxter and I am the dean of the denan<br>school of medicine and I feel hugely<br>privileged to uh have been asked to<br>introduce the one wonderful Conrad recor<br>to this his inaugural professorial<br>lecture and I follow on with greetings<br>uh from Richard and the warmest wishes<br>to uh Conrad his Faro friends and<br>colleagues and to all those who have<br>come here today and I have been really<br>looking forward to this and I have known<br>uh Conrad for many years now before I<br>became Dean I had an associate Dean role<br>in the denan school of medicine and<br>Conrad would come up and drive up and we<br>would be in the same meetings and I was<br>always just stunned by this person with<br>immense energy turning up into these<br>meetings and um and actually coming and<br>being a huge and passionate advocate for<br>Southland and I was really acknowledged<br>um the the value that Southland has had<br>in Conrad's advocacy uh within the<br>medical school and we could not teach<br>our curriculum we could not do what we<br>do if we didn't have Southland as part<br>of our denen school of medicine farno so<br>a huge acknowledgement<br>there um so I have to say it's been<br>difficult to come up with a brief<br>summary uh because um the many faceted<br>aspects of Conrads a career and wider<br>life we're part of the briefing material<br>that I've got so we know Conrad is a<br>consultant General and lap laparoscopic<br>colar rectal surgeon surgical oncologist<br>and<br>endoscopist his Surgical and academic<br>career spans over 30 years including in<br>his early uh training and years he<br>worked in Hal and Jenna and Germany and<br>also undertook a research fellowship at<br>the American Cancer Research Center in<br>Arkansas in the<br>US very fortunately for us as a<br>university and for the Southland<br>Community Conrad moved to inago in 2007<br>to take up his clinical role and so on<br>top of his commitments over time as a<br>very busy and committed surgeon in<br>Southland Conrad has been pivotal for us<br>as a medical school and further<br>developing and nurturing a small and I<br>would say now mediumsized uh vibrant<br>academic environment at Q he's been the<br>denan school of medicine's associate<br>Dean for South land for over 10 years<br>and every year we have over 250 medical<br>students who have some time of the<br>education um in Southland annually and<br>Conrad has a really critical role in<br>overseeing ensuring that those students<br>not only have a good education while<br>they're there but they are also well<br>supported pastorally we have a center in<br>inago that Conrad was very also pivotal<br>in supporting us getting our and<br>running so uh anyone who has met Conrad<br>will know he is a very staunch and<br>committed advocate for the community and<br>has been purposeful in forming<br>relationships between the hospital in<br>Southland our University and with with<br>the community Conrad's Been instrumental<br>in increasing the relationship between<br>the community and has been running<br>public lectures and forums so very much<br>a community person his research has<br>spanned from biomedical to clinical and<br>included Surgical Oncology and pallative<br>Care research and he has published and<br>presented<br>widely alongside this you would think<br>that was enough there are also many<br>other strings to Conrad's bow including<br>having been on expeditions to the Arctic<br>the Antarctic in the Pacific fly fishing<br>hunting diving playing classical guitar<br>and other endeavors I'm sure we may even<br>hear about more about and I have no idea<br>how he manages all these things and we<br>might get some insights this evening um<br>so no doubt today's talk academic<br>surgery a journey will provide us with<br>some wonderful insights into Conrad's<br>journey and some of the many facets to<br>his rich and impactful academic medical<br>and community and family life I'm<br>greatly looking forward to this talk and<br>once again wish to thank Conrad for<br>being an amazing staff member of our<br>school and colleague so so without<br>further Ado i' would like to ask<br>Professor Conrad Rector to present his<br>lecture<br>p<br>a<br>Conrad<br>TAA<br>TAA TAA<br>T<br>CA thank you very much for your kind ver<br>um Joe and Richard thank you all for<br>coming and the ones who are watching<br>this live including the ones from<br>Germany who had to get up early uh 12<br>hours<br>earlier um I thought in order to get you<br>in the right mood I had this clip from<br>the ship a Russian Icebreaker that has<br>been bringing me to the Antarctic and<br>the Beautiful sub Antarctic islands of<br>in the last 11 years as a ships doctor<br>and zodiac drivers and lecturer and a<br>journey<br>like this one is probably like going on<br>an ice prer through the Roaring<br>40s in the Furious<br>50s and the screaming 60s until you<br>possibly get into the silent<br>7s um here you see the AA my River and<br>the church I got<br>married um 35 years ago and I'm still<br>married which is quite something for a<br>surgeon<br>um and just to give you in the right<br>mood um going there is also history lots<br>of history that can be explored in<br>wildlife and since it was a Russian<br>Icebreaker<br>meaning Horsemen don't drive the horses<br>too fast I have nowhere to go I have no<br>one to laugh Horsemen to drive the<br>horses too fast just to get you in the<br>right mood for this talk about the<br>journey um which is always about the<br>journey um happiness is not about making<br>it to the peak of the mountain nor is it<br>about climbing aimlessly around the<br>mountain happiness is the experience of<br>climbing toward the peak but actually is<br>it about happiness anyway or is it more<br>about something else if you would be<br>just happy it would be not what we<br>wanted really it's more about human<br>connection how you can positively<br>influence other lives it's about also<br>ups and downs it's an emotional<br>diversity uh and it might be fulfillment<br>what we are looking for fulfillment can<br>be also Downs now you wonder whether<br>academic surgery is a<br>fulfillment I don't know let's find out<br>it is certainly the perfect b b balance<br>and I know there are quite a few<br>surgeons here in the audience and also<br>listening in<br>inle uh between practical and cable you<br>must be interested in elal challenges of<br>the PO discipline of surgery there are<br>lots of PR you the main interpretor of<br>translation surgical research you<br>contribute to society clinically and<br>academically you directly influence your<br>peers possibly in Allied research Fields<br>if they would just listen sometimes uh<br>you might travel nationally<br>internationally and you have rewarding<br>uh National and international<br>collaborations and you have the ability<br>to directly teach at all levels there<br>are cons of course and you we all know<br>this ass surgence the long operating<br>theater hours we are on call we<br>literally chronically sleep deprived<br>really all our most of our surgical life<br>we should not forget this um and then<br>the nights and the weekends are reserved<br>for possibly research and writing papers<br>which might be declined or funds that<br>might be declined or you go to<br>conferences uh PhD supervisions lectures<br>and then if you succeed to get something<br>accepted there's still a stiff<br>competition of even more driven people<br>and ambitious people who are also<br>looking for certain uh ways to pursue<br>through their career and yes you miss<br>out on family time hobbies and weekend<br>and yes there is not really a lot of<br>money involved either uh which might<br>drive people away so that caused the uh<br>austral Newan Journal of surgery to<br>spend the whole journal to look into<br>whether academic surgery has a future<br>there's a Manpower crisis in academic<br>surgery in Australia and New Zealand<br>that urgently needs to be fixed if we<br>were to continue to train students and<br>what happens you need as a young surgeon<br>to develop your skills and perform<br>without complication to prove your<br>capability that takes time and effort<br>you have to prove yourself in front of<br>your colleagues and this alone can fill<br>your day out without leaving much room<br>for the main reason most people enter<br>academic surgery to explore scientific<br>questions through<br>research that's one of my heroes and I<br>want to quote him at the beginning I<br>will also quote him again at the end as<br>rol<br>you might know the listen fun<br>duplication um which is a solution for<br>some of us with reflux but not for all<br>the more often we do the n the less we<br>really like it but it's a a great way to<br>help uh people who are really miserable<br>and Nissen<br>said that one who is incapable of<br>enduring the hours of desperation is in<br>my view unfit to become a surgeon that<br>is because the trust that the patient<br>places in his surgeon a trust that is<br>unmatched in the history of Human<br>Relationships must be repaid by a<br>strongly imprinted sense of<br>responsibility this is still valid I<br>don't know what the anst think about<br>this but that's how we are taught and<br>how we grow up um Nissen was a younger<br>pupil of sa in Berlin at the sh sh being<br>one of the leading surgical centers uh<br>before World War one and of course<br>because Germany lost hopelessly two<br>world wars uh it was anymore after World<br>War II but 1933 when Hitler came to<br>power he was asked to dismiss some of<br>his Jewish colleagues and he rather<br>chose to leave his career and went to<br>Istanbul and later on he went to<br>Boston and you might have seen this<br>picture and this picture was taken after<br>Nissen operated on Albert Einstein<br>1947 and then uh the um reporters asked<br>Einstein when he came out of the<br>hospital um how are you doing he told<br>them to Nissen my tummy and to BU my<br>tongue that's how this picture<br>happened um what niss did at the time<br>was uh perforated triple anism and he<br>wrapped some Copan around as you do um<br>and he lived another seven<br>years so I started my medical school<br>1984 you see it's a year longer than<br>others Hala is a HomeTown of Frederick<br>handle and know the English claim him<br>but he was actually born in Hala and we<br>hallelujah that's a Marketplace and he<br>never vot in op or anything in Hal he<br>left it when he was young 18 19 years of<br>age but we still claim him as our son<br>and in those days we had to write a<br>medical diploma which gave me the first<br>chance to do research so I was looking<br>at um thyroid Clans and we had um was a<br>clinical study and it got my hands and I<br>got excited so much that I was asking<br>for a year research after my fourth<br>medical year so I interrupted my fourth<br>year that was the first time that it<br>happened at the Martin Luther University<br>at in Hala and I spent one year uh in<br>the lab uh operating on rats we<br>introduced Ben pin introduced sakas and<br>we were looking where the cell is coming<br>from that finally ends up in an mfh in<br>those days it was called malignant fibos<br>hyoma and it gave me the first two<br>Publications and it got excited and<br>hooked and these just found them uh<br>while preparing this talk as I said the<br>preparation of this journey was actually<br>a journey in<br>itself and you see here uh the cysts the<br>oil cysts that we know in 120 days will<br>be sakas we knew where the sakuma will<br>happen and we could look in those States<br>at<br>80P and the lower two pictures anti<br>factor8 his immunis chemistry and anti-<br>Des me stainings he had to be quick<br>because the uh the staining activity<br>disappeared and um the theory was that<br>the plent vascular perivascular cell is<br>actually the prano cell that has the<br>capacity to capacity to turn into other<br>cells and I gave my first talk and I<br>found this while preparing this in the<br>Czech Republic 1989 mind you we grew up<br>in East Germany in those days that was<br>the bestest for us East Germany and the<br>CCH Republic but it was an International<br>Symposium that was a paper I presented<br>And I memorized this talk in English and<br>I don't think anybody understood this in<br>those<br>days with my slides show and accent<br>which over time hasn't really improved<br>much as you can hear and Professor R who<br>was my first Mentor who taught me the<br>basics of research and science over one<br>year in those days we would uh do<br>autopsies in the morning uh the<br>clinicians would come once a week and we<br>would discuss the case from all<br>perspective including from the<br>pathological side it was a huge learning<br>experience everybody had an autopsy who<br>died in the hospital in those days<br>that's all lost unfortunately and I have<br>met many Pathologists who are actually<br>secretly surgeons who got hooked and<br>never left pathology I was almost one of<br>them and then I had three years of<br>training in my mother house I call it<br>the St Elizabeth house and I know that<br>Walter if he got up early he might be<br>listening uh right now um and Dr Corman<br>uh the uh chef at at the time uh in a<br>big hospital he would operate ideally<br>five days a week and I got the skills<br>how to care how to take care of patients<br>and um really taught there and have<br>never lost contact to this s Elizabeth<br>house until today um I also got involved<br>in hospice Hinrich Pi was the one who<br>founded the hospice at the time and also<br>paliative surgery at the end of medical<br>school I was able to go for four months<br>to America I think I had sent 50 letters<br>and got two responses so I went I took<br>them both if you have a choice take both<br>and I went to me hospital in medicine<br>two months and to a Little Rock so when<br>I was doing this register training which<br>was exciting I was missing research and<br>in a Catholic Hospital which is not<br>University you are not really a<br>university person you cannot even go to<br>the library it's very difficult it's<br>very difficult so I called um my friend<br>from Switzerland Simon Hower who had<br>given plot when I was a student there I<br>had given PL not to save the world but I<br>was just hungry I had no money and so I<br>got 10 bucks per blood giving and so he<br>said well um yeah I connected with<br>Martin U and Martin might be listening<br>to this as well uh and Martin said okay<br>let's talk and I said okay let's talk<br>and he said yeah let's talk come over<br>said well I'm in Germany and he said I<br>know come over so I took a flight and I<br>flew over for 5 days and he sent me<br>around um to his mates and then he came<br>back I stayed with him and he said said<br>uh I okay I take you but I have no<br>money and so fine I said I have no money<br>either um and we agreed on this one and<br>then it took a year and that's what I'm<br>saying you really have to be half crazy<br>because um my wife will remember that I<br>spent almost 6<br>months uh or a year just to write this<br>application some of them were declined<br>um eventually I went through the letter<br>and got um from the mil sh foundation<br>and the the D academic a house later on<br>from the ni a three-year Fellowship uh<br>in research with<br>Martin um and you see how strong he is<br>looking in those days I was his first<br>postto I think he tested me out he gave<br>me a picture on Sunday when I arrived on<br>the airport in Little Rock Arkansas so<br>little Ro Arkansas is like inle people<br>feel very sorry and you tell them you're<br>from Little Rock Arkansas um and he gave<br>me a picture and the picture went off<br>the same evening and it never stopped<br>going off really so uh there wasn't much<br>of holiday there wasn't much of<br>Christmas or anything but I would say it<br>was the most intense amazing three years<br>of research I was able to get and I'm<br>very grateful um here is with my<br>daughter at the time she was five k and<br>we also have a son who is an Ary now who<br>was born there and we had good times and<br>he is was more than a boss uh became a<br>very good friend so my topic was<br>radiation and theopathy radiation<br>theopathy uh we need to study it it's<br>hard to study this in humans um it's<br>highly relevant if you talk to radiation<br>oncologists they might think that<br>doesn't really exist because they don't<br>see it like surgeons never have<br>complications of course um but it exists<br>and it's quite prevalent the more we<br>radiate the more side effects we will<br>see and we needed a model that allows us<br>to replicate these injuries to the small<br>bowel which Martin already had<br>established that's an x-ray of a human<br>who has a radiation uropathy and you can<br>see this patient is not only suffering<br>but also very difficult to operate and I<br>found this picture here that probably<br>amplifies this and um you see this in<br>the testimony from tranet leford Martin<br>provided me this video that you can look<br>up on the Internet uh that pelvic<br>radiation disease is not even<br>acknowledged until today as much as it<br>should be that was my research project<br>in Little Rock Arkansas which is here<br>and I need to<br>ask you if you know who this was<br>here<br>anybody<br>um<br>just that's how people got to know uh he<br>is from Hope Bill Clinton and of course<br>you have cotton fields Indian summer and<br>Blue Cross music<br>sometimes we're<br>winter sometimes we<br>will you can imagine I felt like coming<br>there um so that's the animal model uh<br>so we could radiate RS without uh<br>reoperating them as often as we wanted<br>and I spent most of my three years in<br>the lab and I'm not going into too much<br>detail about the research um um but you<br>see that depending we have early and<br>late radiation in injury we looked at a<br>high number of different cyto kindes tjf<br>beta Alpha One of course is the dominant<br>one as you can see here and you see that<br>the more we radiate different<br>fracturation schedules of 4.2 cray over<br>12 days or 5.6 gray over 9 days um you<br>get a different kind of uh TGF better<br>expression which was then with the<br>immune uh image um um was um measured<br>and Quantified and you see if you would<br>take a patient you see the same kind of<br>TGF better expression in this patient<br>and I'm not going again in the details<br>um but we had got a huge number of data<br>and once we looked on the protein level<br>we look then further on the DNA level as<br>you see here with rtpcr and inide to<br>hybrization we modified the model by<br>creating uh putting either a uh pump in<br>and modify the injury to the coin where<br>the where the small ball was or even<br>created a sto in Reds which apparently<br>which amazingly worked nicely as you can<br>see here the uh we could modify and I<br>found my old textbooks lately after we<br>we moved uh uh houses um and I put up<br>here so alog together more than 600 male<br>rats were operated various single and<br>fractionation regimens were tested early<br>and late intestinal ration injury was<br>studied end points you see here and then<br>new sto models were developed which cost<br>uh three years and gave me a lot of data<br>more than 13 Publications some of them<br>published in the American Journal of<br>surgery pathology radiotherapy and blood<br>and carcinogenesis and Martin wanted me<br>to to stay so at Night from from from<br>10: to 2: in the morning um and Sabine<br>will remember I studied for the American<br>boards uh US1 and two in order to<br>improve my speaking skills I went to TST<br>Master<br>International which uh was amazing I<br>must I must say it really um well helped<br>a<br>lot and then the next um yeah the next<br>nine years I spent in Jina um at the<br>time I was really happy there but since<br>I was not really home we had now two<br>kids two more were under way um we<br>decided or as was decided we go<br>back and um we started all over again in<br>um first in Hala but then I was called<br>to get a spot in Gina and in that's in<br>turingia here the university is uh was<br>founded 1558 an amazing City surrounded<br>by mountains um I finished my German<br>habilitation 2002 and then my uh Subs<br>specialty in surgical Fellowship in<br>visceral gastrointestinal corrector<br>surgery oncology I spent my nights and<br>days in the lab afterwards I supervised<br>PhD students um seven of them at the<br>time and in those days we had to give<br>frontal lectures not small groups so we<br>had 200 students twice a week and we<br>would teach them the basic and surgery<br>uh basic surgery and also special<br>surgery so they came into your clinical<br>attachment already well equipped with an<br>understanding what we were going to do<br>nowadays that's not the case anymore<br>unfortunately um um and I was on boards<br>and what you do in those days by the way<br>at the time my we were both working<br>fulltime and we had that this I I found<br>this I I took this yesterday this<br>picture last week so it's it's actually<br>teaching and in those days I had four<br>kids and I didn't see many of them or<br>much of them and<br>after uh by the way after 9 years we<br>decided we need a<br>break uh in those days um since you<br>don't spend time in the lab anymore your<br>research changes in a way you do Network<br>you collaborate which is very difficult<br>in vagle and uh these were<br>carcinogenesis studies or uh cell<br>culture studies we<br>contributed um or clinical studies when<br>we followed up our patients and we had a<br>high volume uh um university Department<br>with three operating theaters every day<br>and the liver transplant<br>unit so that's where my kids went to<br>school and when uh the Twins were nine<br>and Paul was 11 we decided we go away<br>for a year I had a phone call at the<br>time with um Mari Pier um the other one<br>was Keith the manager and the German<br>surgeon happened to be there as well and<br>then they asked me on the phone why do<br>you want to come to in ragle and I<br>said I just saw the movie the fastest<br>Indian I know where you<br>are I looked up fly fishing I must see<br>and um<br>yes I saw what the Rolling Stones have<br>said about in wagle um and he said yeah<br>why don't you come so that's how we<br>ended up and it was exactly um like I<br>thought uh the weather the wind was<br>coming from the<br>side um and and I thought what I what<br>what have I been doing here<br>um one year that's that's it uh again we<br>don't wear shoes in our Hospital which<br>is quite modern<br>we take them off uh and that's okay and<br>I thought I'm now really a southlander<br>when my son went swimming with me and<br>and didn't take his towel off when we<br>were rending a movie in South City and<br>just walked into the um video store<br>interestingly everybody else looked like<br>him as well at the time so that was in<br>vagle and that were the Rolling Stones<br>and not repeating what is still in the<br>Lonely Planet but I found another<br>interesting quotation about Danon<br>because they also gave a concert made<br>DMC is like V Vegas I'm pretty sure that<br>makes every southlander feel good<br>now you come to the airport and here<br>that's what you see dreams are possible<br>because of Bert monu Herbert James monu<br>who in 19 he was already 68 when he went<br>to the salt salt uh yeah Salt Lakes<br>really to Bonville to test his Indian<br>and one of the records in in, cubic<br>centimeter is still unbroken until today<br>and um as you see um that was a movie<br>2006 that came out and they are still<br>racing today on the orti beach uh in<br>February nowadays not everybody succeeds<br>as you can see<br>here um but in vag to say just uh two<br>slides um now we have a direct flight to<br>Oakland uh I mean my kids went through<br>James harest and there was an evening<br>with previous alumni and six of them<br>were Olympics Olympic Champions just<br>went to James harus I have not met a<br>single one in Germany when I was uh<br>there before and then the really nice<br>Vel and that's just a few examples uh A1<br>billion aquaculture possibly coming up<br>we have the data center possibly coming<br>we have uh something happened in Pluff<br>and and you can all visit our 200<br>million 200<br>million City Mall which is not always<br>there<br>the next syn will be the $60 million<br>museum with the two Atara that you can<br>see will have a new home in the tatara<br>enclosure uh but this is just the future<br>possibly of Southland you have to really<br>love the countryside but what is most<br>amazing are the people and in those days<br>um we would all go as a hospital to the<br>city with serve to City uh in a Way co<br>has killed this but the people make this<br>place so special and I must say I have<br>not regreted a single day since we came<br>to in caraland for 16 years ago now how<br>is it like to come from a big Center to<br>a small Hospital which was Modern 2004<br>of course it was built to small and it<br>doesn't matter who is here being pled<br>either National or labor it was probably<br>both of them who build it too small and<br>now we are struggling with not enough<br>theater capacity and the capacity but<br>how is this like you come from an<br>anonymous Center uh in a in a in a city<br>where everybody knows everybody there<br>are no secrets absolutely no secrets<br>anymore and you have to face your<br>surgery the next day in the supermarket<br>and if it's hemorrhoids you don't want<br>to see your patient after your surgery<br>for hemorrhoids but you have to and that<br>makes it complete different and only<br>people who have worked in smaller<br>centers know how vulnerable you are<br>actually are in a in in in a smaller<br>center and and you might actually become<br>very scared at times with what you are<br>doing in this article published 2017 it<br>says those of us who have chosen to<br>practice rural areas will tell you that<br>the life of a rural surgeon can be of<br>high pressure<br>and professional isolation now we don't<br>have U nobody can sue each other here so<br>there's a no fault policy with ACC<br>however the data show clearly and I<br>would think that most surgeons come<br>agree with me and not surgeons many GPS<br>nowadays who have to face this and<br>anaest and everybody who is actually<br>treating patients that uh there is a<br>kind of defensive medical U medicine<br>Happening Here U because you might end<br>up like in the mediev times in the<br>newspaper on the title page with your<br>face not looking really sexy anymore uh<br>because it's your reputational risk you<br>are completely at your end if this<br>happens to you in a small community the<br>only thing you can do you walk away so<br>there's a fear of complaint and why<br>would you then take a risk why would you<br>operate someone who maybe will be just<br>fine the next day you're tempted to sit<br>on these patients and I must say I might<br>do this of course sometimes it's a<br>better choice but there is a philosophy<br>that is everywhere and I will quote<br>Rudolf Nissen again who said essentially<br>I believe that more Misfortune arises<br>through a mission or hesitation in<br>Urgent surgery than through operative<br>complications so we have to shoulder our<br>complications and the responsibility as<br>surgeons and hopefully don't get uh<br>unnecessary attack and then shy away<br>from taking any risk because not<br>operating someone who urgently needs<br>surgery does not help your patient at<br>all it might help you getting away uh<br>from a lawsuit or HDC complaint and I<br>was looking into paliative surgery we<br>published um a few also a book chapter<br>and this article on paliative surgery<br>and paliative care and surgery is also<br>an example when would you go and operate<br>and who would take the risk and um and<br>that was quite exciting in in in vagle<br>and Southland we have so weird cases you<br>could also publish lots of case reports<br>which doesn't get you into a Prof voral<br>position because it doesn't count really<br>but it's very exciting and we can all<br>learn from this nevertheless that's my<br>bread and butter in in ragle the movie<br>doesn't work that's a n Fun duplication<br>um uh we are still doing the same way<br>more or less um right Mark uh like like<br>niss or<br>TP Markus into TP which is a almost like<br>a n but not um and transanal endoscopic<br>merch search we do atomies we do the<br>hernas either open or laparoscopically<br>as you can see<br>here um and and colon cancer of course<br>as<br>well uh what we have in inak kagle and<br>that's why we are able to do this and I<br>must say for the last 16 years I have<br>seen this again and again is extremely<br>amazing support from the danan<br>University and the surgical department<br>and some of my colleagues are sitting<br>here tonight<br>um who are very influential in in in<br>doing this and I would like to thank you<br>all for for supporting us in these times<br>when we when we had to tackle<br>complicated cases so a strong<br>collaboration with academic institutions<br>is crucial and mentoring to to continue<br>doing what we have been doing<br>laparoscopically now how do you become a<br>laparoscopic surgeon of course research<br>is everything and sure enough someone<br>looked into this published in the in of<br>search<br>uh 2000 archives of surgery 2007 and<br>they found that video game skills and<br>past video game experience are<br>significant predictors of demonstrated<br>laparoscopic kills and here we have<br>research they also found that if you<br>play longer than an hour you don't get<br>into mid<br>school um 2012 I owe it to Gordon will<br>who has been the associate in Southland<br>for six years and uh the dean at the<br>time Dr John Adams um to ask me whether<br>I would like to take over this position<br>at the time we continued to to publish<br>you know like weird atomas 14 cm long or<br>rare gists um but as Joe mentioned for<br>the next 10 years I would spend three<br>days a month in the needen drive up and<br>sit on the table because I felt that<br>they need to communicate and connect<br>with your colleagues because otherwise<br>you speak not the same language and you<br>wonder why nothing happens and why there<br>such a misunderstanding<br>why in vagle might feel uh like this the<br>poor cousin all the time and and the<br>other way around and in order to talk<br>and invite our colleagues to in vagle to<br>show what what's happening what<br>potential is there and vice versa there<br>is a feeling on both sides uh that can<br>be sometimes arrogance that doesn't help<br>for working together and um I think it<br>was crucial to get to know each<br>other um in teaching and uh we we we had<br>funding at the time we we we started new<br>research projects we collaborated with<br>danan and other other cities um and part<br>some of us would give lectures and then<br>eaten so we grew together I thought in<br>2015 um there was a promotion to<br>clinical associate professor in 2015 we<br>also started to do stuff development<br>workshops because in vagle we also have<br>been working and still do working in<br>silos and you see here um uh who who<br>would be coming um down to in vagle<br>um Rob Walker and uh and Tim Wilkinson<br>and the talk I was giving at the time um<br>to the dhb because we also invited our<br>managers that was Carol hitle at the<br>time uh was excellent patient care<br>teaching and research Belong Together uh<br>from their perspective it would possibly<br>be mainly kpis and patient care and not<br>research and teaching and sure enough of<br>course she didn't come but she gave a<br>video clip and uh promised that it<br>belongs together that was a good start<br>at least and we had the teach the<br>teachers meeting uh speakers from the<br>University of danan and Christ Church<br>also came uh and as you can see here in<br>the audience it's not just for doctors<br>it's also not just for medical students<br>it's our whole team consists of allite<br>health and nurses who are also speakers<br>as you can see here um um on the same<br>eye level which makes this place so<br>special and then 2018 I know Michael was<br>there we had most of the head of<br>departments from the nting coming to our<br>research Symposium as you can see<br>here um we had statistics we had uh<br>Gastrology um we had pathology but we<br>also had our uh clinicians from inaga<br>giving talks on the same ey level about<br>their research topics and we connected I<br>thought very nicely the topic was there<br>is no innovation without research and no<br>progress without Innovation that was<br>mainly directed at the exec SB at the<br>time and you see here that um Jane<br>Wilson who gave an amazing talk on<br>holistic health care uh more than just<br>kpis incorporating patients care<br>teaching and<br>research and you see Bara you see the<br>discussion with management with<br>clinicians with students with the sit<br>and bar Taylor giving it talk about the<br>role of Southland here we had invited<br>the GPS and connected and the talk would<br>be uh what can we manage at home that's<br>what the D consultant ask or uh what the<br>GP would ask what does a GP want from a<br>well functioning hospital and suddenly<br>we would talk to each other and things<br>that were not discussed in the past<br>suddenly came out and then 2018 we<br>started our first public lecture now<br>public lecture is not so easy to give a<br>talk really for maybe an academic or<br>clinici because it's not about teaching<br>them it's actually more about us<br>listening to them having an ear on the<br>ground and that was the first one the<br>guest speaker was Chris and myself and<br>here's Paul winter who has been<br>supporting us for many many years uh<br>voluntarily and we had no idea who would<br>be coming they had absolutely no idea<br>that was the first public lecture it<br>could be just two three people and sure<br>enough we had a full house and Chris as<br>he does took a selfie and put it on<br>Facebook the same night now the public<br>lecture um is if you cannot explain it<br>simply you don't understand it well<br>enough it's a teaching tool also for us<br>clinicians it's an opportunity to go out<br>and listen what the public would like to<br>know we had discussions were hot and<br>exciting but we also tried to learn or<br>relearn how to discuss things that are<br>really difficult in an cultivated and<br>non-judgmental way we might have lost<br>sometimes disability but we would tackle<br>different topics as you see here uh knee<br>surgery from the uh orthopedic surgeons<br>prostate management breast cancer uh gy<br>and here you see one of our urologists<br>talking about screening and the three<br>the two people as Nicola Branson Paul<br>Winder who have been uh and Jos Hudson<br>who have been uh constantly volunteering<br>and preparing this in the evening out of<br>passion and then we thought we are ready<br>to tuckle something really hot which was<br>mental health as you know Mahatma Gandhi<br>said you can't lead a life without<br>suffering and also euthanasia and in<br>order to make it not judgmental uh we<br>had a lawyer and um and philosopher and<br>paliative medicine doctor and we did not<br>need Security on this evening and it was<br>a hot discussion<br>interestingly we can see now uh the<br>success of this legisl at the time uh we<br>were asking the audience because we had<br>to send 100 people away we had 5,600<br>people watching it live still on the<br>hospice website uh you are here you are<br>interested in euthanasia you're<br>passionate I'm sure you are who has read<br>the<br>legislation and guess who has read the<br>legislation<br>nobody and so I wonder whether these<br>lectures should have happened much more<br>in the country and allow us not just<br>mental to to actually get a better<br>understanding what we are actually<br>voting for and then I read this article<br>from Professor Dorman pristin of the<br>medical school in Oakland about 82 years<br>of ineffectual reforms and what can be<br>done about and we had this uh lecture<br>just a while ago and the take home<br>message was probably um that we should<br>stop looking at an NHS which is not<br>anymore the eny of the world maybe has<br>been many many many many many many many<br>years ago<br>but look at other countries like<br>Scandinavia or Europe who might have a<br>system that works better we don't have<br>the answer for this but at least we were<br>able to discuss this topic and we had uh<br>by the way both uh members of the<br>parties in the audience and the point<br>was that this should actually be a<br>bipartisan approach it doesn't help to<br>blame the other party now and not before<br>either um and I hope it was uh listened<br>to to 2014 uh was primarily run by Paul<br>Winder and the sit we had our medical<br>students connect with our um uh nursing<br>students in LS lately we didn't know it<br>has a name at the time IP now it's of<br>course big but in those days uh we just<br>did it we have one of the most modern<br>simulation Labs that's Paul Wi on the<br>upper level and these are some feedbacks<br>from uh attachments who were in surgery<br>or in Orthopedics or in op GYN or ined<br>or anesthetics now if you get this<br>feedback from your students that keeps<br>you on your tour so it's amazing for us<br>and a privilege to have these students<br>and um I think we all Thrive when we<br>have them uh because again they keep us<br>on our tours here you see professors<br>Marilyn hippner and Barry Taylor West<br>Jenkins and Cony pow and Willow McDonald<br>MCH s who all put their heart into a<br>project that suddenly happened so dreams<br>are possible in inle and in New<br>here Wilkinson's in the middle<br>Wilkinson and we are now Turning New<br>Zealand into a football nation um and we<br>have now an education center which uh is<br>one of the most modern ones where our<br>students come and can study all night<br>24/7 but not the students also the stuff<br>from the hospital because we moved the<br>library into this building and they<br>connect over there and uh when the<br>um Education and Research Center which<br>on the upper level cost probably 3 and a<br>half million and the university put 1.5<br>million into the lower level um we had<br>everybody coming to celebrate the uh<br>opening as you can see here with Reon Dr<br>ruon zille at the time the chancellor um<br>it was quite an event even from<br>Wellington in those days um it's I want<br>to make the point that it's difficult to<br>network in a smaller center it was<br>possible<br>um this one for example with Steven<br>Robertson but he also published<br>interesting cases the latest one with<br>Mavis who is also here tonight thank you<br>um and I also looked into um book<br>chapters I was asked to write on<br>Surgical Oncology these are some of the<br>ongoing research projects right now and<br>as an academic you are not only anymore<br>sitting on the bench and actually doing<br>the immunis chemistry and I have done<br>thousands of those you try to facilitate<br>this kind of research so we have a few<br>papers in the pipeline you see uh the<br>projects written down U obesity induced<br>immune dysfunction the study that John<br>Woodfield who also in the in the<br>audience tonight has inaugurated uh we<br>we tried to join um by randomizing<br>patients into different arms uh in order<br>to condition them for their correct<br>surgery and then the Private Hospital<br>Southern Cross has been the first<br>hospital who introduced uh or included<br>patients from the Private Hospital into<br>a study of dogs who are able to detect<br>bow cancer in patients urine if you<br>compare this with our fobt which has a<br>sensitivity and specificity of maybe<br>less than 90% And certainly you have up<br>to 15% fils negative so we have a have<br>no bleeding but a Cancer and it doesn't<br>is not picked up can be even higher and<br>up to f f positive as well which means<br>you get an endoscopy for no reason this<br>is a specificity and<br>and and sensitivity of up to 100%<br>Pauline plumfield is in charge in mosil<br>and she sent me this little clip that<br>shows you this<br>exciting uh yeah possibly future tool we<br>might have in our<br>amario that was a positive<br>sample and the last part of my talk is I<br>had a chance and was invited to work in<br>the Pacific that is a talk for itself uh<br>this we are landing but it was not<br>aort<br>now the point I want to make here and I<br>have made it in another talk I gave at<br>the global Health conference is uh it's<br>amazing to be able to do this in in my<br>case in honara Solomon Islands in<br>kirakira in makira in also Solomon<br>Islands in in in in sua and fi and also<br>in samua but the more I have done it the<br>less I was convinced that it might be<br>the right thing to do possibly and um I<br>think these are the things that I have<br>taken out so far um that we should not<br>go in and operate complex patience and<br>go out again and leave the situation as<br>it is and was before we need to start to<br>stop to look to listen and then try to<br>understand empower the local<br>organizations have long-term commitment<br>not just the one time off and and and<br>certainly not pursue an altruistic<br>voluntarism as it is called so I don't<br>have the solution I'm excited to invited<br>but that means as a surgeon I would<br>probably not even operate I would not<br>even scrub in I would be just there and<br>I want I would want that the<br>registar this is Stenton here who was<br>MRA and kirakira knows how to do this<br>procedure at the end of the week by<br>himself and they never need to come back<br>and the same for other procedures very<br>complicated but it's an amazing um<br>possibly activity for the future may<br>talk if you knew what we were doing it<br>would not be called research would it I<br>don't know whether was it the summary<br>let me<br>see yeah that's the summary success is<br>the ability to go from failure to<br>failure without losing your enthusiasm<br>just for the young ones here if they<br>want to pursue this uh you need to start<br>early as early as<br>possible you need to network that's part<br>of the game you try to learn and do<br>bench work try to understand the<br>language of the laboratory try to do<br>sings Yourself animal experiments<br>whatever even molecular biology which is<br>probably challenging for a surgeon you<br>would think try to present and publish<br>put yourself out uh but you can only<br>really do this and that's my philosophy<br>if you if you are as in your own core<br>skills as a gastrologist or anesthetist<br>or surgeon that you or GP that you are<br>good in what you're doing that you your<br>patients come to you and trust you not<br>because you give a talk here with a<br>slight German accent but because they<br>they trust you because you are good or<br>solid solid in your skills and that's<br>very challenging be curious and<br>adventurous and stay true to the basic<br>principles um and again I would like to<br>quote Rudolf nen again one more time and<br>that's a really important quote for me<br>stay true to the basic principles that<br>have advanced medicine for centuries<br>educating young Physicians and nurses<br>preserving academic freedom preserving<br>academic freedom and I repeat it again<br>preserving academic freedom which is<br>really really important respecting human<br>dignity and guiding Medical Practice by<br>scientific evidence this has not changed<br>and it looks like that we are losing<br>this a little bit in our academic<br>freedom my personal opinion is when you<br>have depths the government should<br>support universities to you cannot make<br>uh and we talked about this yesterday<br>you cannot make teaching more efficient<br>by uh kicking out lecturers you have to<br>actually invest invest in the pr power<br>of this country and the universities are<br>the leading uh<br>institutions I would like to thank you<br>all for coming here and who is still<br>awake on the uh computers but I would<br>particularly think and this is just not<br>everybody of course is my father clous<br>and my<br>father-in-law daa and Professor<br>R who taught me the basics um um not the<br>autopsies in those days but how to do a<br>proper experiment and finish it and<br>present it uh my clinical teacher<br>teachers Dr gard kman and W asger who<br>became the head of the department um in<br>the Catholic St Elizabeth Hospital Hala<br>uh who taught me so many things not just<br>the surgical skills but also ethics um<br>also Henri Pi who was the founder of the<br>the hospice and he was actually he was<br>became a nurse just to understand<br>hospice uh he also was the one who<br>married us and baptized my daughter and<br>buried my<br>father-in-law um and then at the<br>University of China was a very intense<br>time I had three teachers all of them uh<br>amazing surgeons clinical s surgeons in<br>different ways of operating one was a<br>vascular surgeon different way Andre<br>would know complete different approach<br>uh going going down to the vessel with<br>no anxiety the other one was using more<br>plant dsection um and and and the other<br>one was a very experienced liver<br>transplant surgeon so Professor martinh<br>Hower Jensen of course who gave me the<br>most intense and amazing three years in<br>a high powered experimental laboratory<br>research uh he taught me so many things<br>and he also gave me a lot of friendship<br>and my German colleagues and friends<br>including olish tilo winfried Stefan DOI<br>and Michael telbo who is kiwi in<br>Sydney and I would like to extend my<br>gratitude also to myself and and thean<br>colleagues and there are just some of<br>them um including Mark and Frank fisel<br>and John mol and Ian betet and zaran and<br>Steven Robertson bar Taylor Chris<br>Jackson Mari Fifer John Adams Michael<br>Schult Dre bexter and many many others<br>I'm also grateful to the Southland<br>Medical Foundation who might listen<br>tonight who have helped us over the<br>first funding uh way to get a senior<br>research fellow we have now the second<br>one Dr Sil noyman who is crucial for<br>keeping all the different research<br>projects running uh we would not be able<br>to survive without her we have carry and<br>the needen um and of course the<br>volunteers uh and this smch storm and<br>Paul winter and Nicola and particular<br>just H only came at night just<br>volunteering and many others uh to<br>support our public lectures and then<br>friends and colleagues and nurses and<br>doctors and LS and even managers um who<br>petty petty came up just to listen and I<br>really appreciate this uh and that is<br>how we get things done by respecting<br>each other and listening to each other<br>but that wouldn't happen of course<br>without my four kids one is here the<br>others are listening uh you see they are<br>flying on their own now uh most of them<br>they still come home and empty the<br>freezer by by the way all of them and<br>the one who is keeping this together is<br>my wife Sabin only without her I<br>wouldn't be here<br>so I cannot say more about this but um<br>she keeps us together and<br>um I would have failed many times in<br>life I think and this is usually the<br>case with many men who show up in give<br>talks there's always some stronger<br>behind who make this happen now my last<br>slide um the Amish call it um gasen<br>height they call it yeled or submission<br>submission to obviously got for the<br>Amish um I was able to talk to them in<br>Lancaster and Ohio when I did my<br>sabatical there they still speak the<br>same language looks like old saian<br>little bit funny but I could talk to<br>them and that's my take home message I<br>want to learn how to let go a little bit<br>and get some gassen height uh to get<br>things done uh to yel things um and<br>therefore I would like to thank you very<br>much for your attention let go thank<br>you<br>Mii<br>Conrad Mark Thompson foret is my name<br>I'm here representing the department of<br>surgical Sciences in the University but<br>also as a clinician Conrad is in the<br>same<br>uh Southern tat order region as a GI<br>general surgeon so we're all colleagues<br>together working on the clinical side as<br>well as the academic<br>side so Conrad I think has demonstrated<br>very clearly in his lecture the<br>attributes that have brought him to be<br>promoted to<br>Professor he has an outstanding energy<br>um he thrives on challenges and he<br>showed some examples of the um Southern<br>learning and Research Center which he<br>was an outstanding driver behind and<br>well I was just down there last week um<br>when we had a teaching and education day<br>for coloral surgeons and it's a<br>fantastic facility so that I guess<br>Conrad has not only done his own<br>research but he's contributed hugely to<br>making a research environment for others<br>and he takes students and surgical<br>trainers on the journey on the journey<br>with<br>him he has curiosity as you've seen in<br>his talk and that Sparks his thinking in<br>his ideas and he pursues<br>them he doesn't take no for an answer<br>very easily if he's really passionate<br>about something and I think we've all<br>experienced that and I've especially<br>seen that at the in the medical school<br>when he's fighting for Southland um to<br>get their things across the line their<br>activities across the line and the<br>achievements with what they've done down<br>there in developing a thriving Center is<br>is outstanding and I'm humbled by their<br>research days where the presentations<br>are there and the research is on<br>display<br>and he's passionate about teaching and<br>he the students every year vote vote for<br>um the best teachers and he's a multi-<br>awward winner in that uh that area so<br>well done for your teaching as well as<br>all your other schools Conrad you've<br>generations of medical students sing<br>your<br>praises and at the Pinnacle of all<br>Conrad does he still I think aspires to<br>deliver excellence and does in the<br>operating room it's that uh the drama of<br>the operating theater and achieving well<br>there that I think is a pinnacle of of<br>what he does and he does that well and<br>with<br>Excellence so Conrad thank you so much<br>for your excellently prepared lecture<br>tonight and how you I don't know how you<br>do all those little videos that you sort<br>of put in and click and they go and just<br>one bit goes and not the rest does very<br>smoothly done um so thank you very much<br>for that and taking us on your journey<br>and sharing that Journey with
