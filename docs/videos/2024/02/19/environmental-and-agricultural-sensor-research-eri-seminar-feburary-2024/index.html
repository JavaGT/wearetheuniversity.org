Traditional sensor technologies, such as those fabricated with macro-machining or MEMS techniques, often have long and expensive development cycles. These sensors can also be very expensive to manufacture in small quantities. Dr Robert Dean at Auburn University has been developing a variety of low-cost sensors applicable to environmental and agricultural applications by using commercial printed circuit board (PCB) technology.  This technology is mature, low-cost, and has short fabrication times. With this sensor technology, electrodes on the circuit board are designed so that they electromagnetically interact with the environment surrounding the circuit board. The presence or quantity present of a measurand results in a corresponding change in the circuit boardâ€™s impedance, which is easily detected with electronic circuitry. This sensor technology has been applied to various applications, including drought monitoring, sea turtle nesting research, soil moisture content measurement, and rust detection.<br> <br>Dr Robert N. Dean is a McWane Endowed Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA.  He has over 33 years of professional experience in academic and industrial environments. Dr Dean conducts research in a variety of areas, including sensors, instrumentation, and electronics. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in electronics, sensors, MEMS, and photovoltaics.

Auburn<br>University um he will be talking about<br>environmental and agricultural<br>sensors um as you know all Environmental<br>Research um is fueled by data and<br>collecting data through sensors is very<br>important right thank you much thank you<br>for having me here it's an honor to be<br>on<br>Advance okay all right as an<br>introduction I'm going to walk around<br>that's how I teach I don't sit so uh we<br>all enviral sensors have many<br>applications including Precision<br>agriculture pollution monitoring weather<br>forecasting drought monitoring food and<br>water safety Etc and our SS of<br>requirements obviously are going to be<br>accurate and we like them to be very low<br>cost particularly they're going to be<br>for disposable or onetime use sensor<br>applications so that's kind of where my<br>focus is is to see how can we make very<br>inexpensive<br>sensors uh and to do that I've turned to<br>PR circuit board technology now my<br>background for many years I did Mims<br>research micro mechanical systems<br>including sensors and RF a bunch of<br>different areas uh they work really well<br>in in large quantities they can be<br>really inexpensive but from a a a<br>you know low quantity use application<br>like a university they're actually very<br>expensive if I send a student into our<br>clean room to build a mim's device it's<br>typically going to cost me at least<br>$10,000 uh just for them to go into the<br>lab and begin and it'll probably take<br>three months to have anything out if<br>ever it works so I started looking at<br>other Technologies uh print circuit<br>board technology affords viable lowcost<br>environmental sensors and I think it<br>S as we all know PR circuit board<br>technology is a very lowcost materal<br>technology it's been around for many<br>many decades it's used in most<br>electronic systems now uh the structure<br>i' got a diagram here you basically have<br>a a rigid<br>substrate that for for for rigid ones<br>it's a unless we grade fiberglass called<br>eass um on top and and below it and even<br>inside of it layer ones you've got<br>pattern copper<br>traces uh if you have exposed copper the<br>typically have a low corrosion surface<br>finish uh it could be plated 10 it could<br>be gold depending on the type of board<br>that you get uh surrounding everything<br>but the exposed traces you typically<br>have a polymeric coating called solder<br>mask that if you're soldering components<br>it limits the solder to just exposed<br>metal areas uh I I use that for other<br>applications you also have plated vas<br>you can connect traces on different<br>layers together electrically then of<br>course you have attached electronic<br>components and that's an example of a<br>circuit board that was from a project uh<br>I had not related to this that my<br>students design and built Electronics so<br>I also do that part of too uh with print<br>board technology you have many many<br>commercial manufacturers to choose from<br>uh they're typically for simple designs<br>they're very low cost you can get free<br>design software to design your circuit<br>boards you can literally sit down your<br>desk in an afternoon to sign a board<br>order it it shows up you know within<br>about two to three weeks it might cost<br>you 10 to 15 us so it's it's much<br>cheaper much faster than Mims technology<br>so the question is can we use this to<br>make sensors and I would say the answer<br>to that is<br>yes so for PBC or PCB circuit board<br>sensors we want to use the lowcost<br>materials and Commercial manufacturing<br>processes they used to make nor for the<br>circuit boards and to do that we're<br>going to design our traces on the board<br>whether they're exposed or whether<br>they're insulated so that they<br>electromagnetically interact with the<br>environment around the circuit board and<br>then that interaction will basically<br>change the the impedance of these traces<br>and then we can use that to back out<br>what's going on in the environment for<br>example we can measure parameters such<br>as moisture content or materials and<br>contact with the board we can measure<br>the LI connectivity of aqu solutions the<br>board may be dipped into can detect<br>icing um we can look for chemical<br>contamination<br>Etc uh also because it is a print in<br>circuit board it's very easy to go<br>through and add Electronics to it<br>directly so that's something you can't<br>really do with the mim's<br>device and this is an example of just<br>you know a very small very low cost per<br>circuit board sensor and that that's a<br>large so for our PR circuit board<br>sensors I'm mention you've got two types<br>of of really electrodes you got those<br>that are exposed to the environment and<br>those are useful for any type of of<br>resistive or conductive coupling<br>particularly through an aquous solution<br>then you got those that are insulated<br>where you can either do capacitive<br>coupling or inductive couple and you can<br>use that basically once again as your<br>technology now there's three type of<br>print sensing elements I'm going to show<br>examples of sensors from you've got your<br>exposed electrodes and that's good for<br>resistance or conducted sing you've got<br>insulated what they call interdigitated<br>electrodes it's like two um hair combs<br>interdigitated together where the tin<br>are in between each other but not<br>touching and typically that's going to<br>be up under that polymeric solder mass<br>and that allows you to do capactive<br>sensing and then you can build these<br>these planer inductor structures and do<br>magnetic sensing I got a couple example<br>sensors that I brought with me for some<br>of the research I'm doing here that's<br>why it's got my University's logo and<br>University of wado on them so going pass<br>these around um this is the conductive<br>one this is the magnetic one and then<br>this is the capacitive one so I do want<br>to get these back but I'll pass them<br>around<br>see and each of those<br>sensors is about<br>$3.50 in low quantity so they're they're<br>relatively<br>inexpensive so let's talk about some<br>sensor applications first of all let<br>talk talk about using the Expos the<br>exposed electrode sensor typically they<br>would have two exposed planer metal<br>electrodes as shown there um you could<br>have more electrodes there's some things<br>you could do with additional electrodes<br>but the typical one would have two and<br>it's speci specifically designed to<br>detect the electrical conductance when<br>measured when the sensor is is immersed<br>in an aquous<br>solution um you can you can measure the<br>sensor cell constant and converts your<br>conductance readings over to electrical<br>conductivity<br>and your electric conductivity your EC<br>is proportional to ion content if you<br>calibrate for temperature at least for<br>relatively low dissolve ion<br>concentrations which is most<br>applications that for environmental<br>sensing and they have equivalent sensors<br>they're commercially available for<br>measuring electrc conductivity but<br>typically they consist of two fragile<br>parallel plate mounted uh electrodes and<br>those T to be quite expensive and<br>they're very fragile as as a planer<br>electrode structure it's it's very<br>robust uh you can you know you can take<br>something and scratch it but it it works<br>very well for a very long time with<br>it'll it'll take pretty rugged of use<br>and still<br>work so a couple applications that I've<br>done uh one of the early ones was we're<br>looking at drought monitoring in<br>estuaries of course estuaries are<br>confluent ecosystems in bodies of water<br>between saltwater and freshwater<br>ecosystems and the salw grading exists<br>between the onshore of fresh water that<br>enters from Rivers creeks and then the<br>offshore entering saltwater and when you<br>have a drought it basically disrupts<br>ecosystem so what I want to do was<br>develop a sensor where I can espcially<br>spatially measure the salt content<br>basically to determine where is that<br>solinity gradient and how's it changed<br>uh when salt dissolves in water it<br>affects elal conductance oral<br>conductivity proportionately when you<br>adjust for temperature and there<br>therefore if I put a lot of these<br>sensors out there I can actually measure<br>the drought effects um by basically<br>measuring the conductance at a bunch of<br>different locations so one of the early<br>PCB sensors I developed was for that<br>application was a photograph of it that<br>one um I used the standard just 10<br>plated um exposed electrodes later I<br>switched to Gold because I found a<br>company that did gold for the same price<br>so this one would be a little more<br>reactive in a say a coastal environment<br>but from the test that I did I could not<br>detect for short see any difference<br>gold so the results basically showed for<br>um for since sea water mixed with fresh<br>water I got a very linear measure with<br>conductance so by measuring the<br>conductance and caliber I can back out<br>what is the percent sea water in in the<br>solution and um so nice linear<br>correlation and it was very repeatable<br>between different sensors so by all<br>these works I'm talking about are<br>published and I'm I'm linking my<br>Publications on there um I'd be happy to<br>send them anybody who wants them just<br>know so later work I did was to develop<br>an EC sensor to improve sea turtle nesy<br>research sea turtle nest nesting sites<br>are particularly vulnerable to human<br>interaction I mean direct human<br>interaction also artificial lighting as<br>well as litter and pollution and of<br>course roaming dogs really all those are<br>basically CS by humans uh nesting sites<br>therefore heavily researched uh and<br>typically there's four metrics they look<br>at the temperature of the site the<br>moisture content of the sound around<br>sand around the site the salinity of the<br>sand around the site and also the beach<br>slope the one I focused in on was<br>sand now for measuring the solinity of<br>the sand the typical measurement<br>technique consists of going out there<br>and collecting 50 grams of sand around<br>the nest drying it then mixing it into<br>50 milliliters of deionized water and<br>then measuring the lit conductivity of<br>the<br>solution and once again EC is<br>proportional to the salinity of the sand<br>when it's calibrated for temperature and<br>and for low dissolved salt concentration<br>such as what you would have in this<br>application and 50 grams of sand is a<br>fair amount of sand so my thought was<br>what if we could significantly reduce<br>that uh if we could reduce the amount of<br>sand required then taking that sample<br>would result in less disturbance to a<br>nest<br>or it would allow for more samples to be<br>collected around the nest without<br>increased disturbance and both of those<br>would be beneficial so I developed a<br>sensor for doing<br>that so this is the sensor I developed<br>it's also the same layout as one of the<br>sensors I passed around um this one I<br>switched to a different lowcost PCB<br>vendor uh so they as plate all their<br>exposed copper and gold uh the company<br>is Ash Park it's a US company and our<br>Pacific Northwest each one of Those<br>sensors without the con without the<br>connector cost me about $357 in small<br>quantities uh from that comparing it to<br>a commercial EC meter I backed out the<br>cell constant so I can give conductance<br>read EC readings then I adjusted<br>everything to Sigma 25 means the EC at<br>reference of 25 degrees celsus that's<br>sort of the standard I went through and<br>did a bunch of calibration tests with<br>sea salt and Di water to determine an<br>equation to back out the mass of sea<br>salt uh based upon the sigma 25 reading<br>that's the equation for that so now I<br>have my sensor<br>calibrated so we actually went to a an<br>active nesting seal nesting site in the<br>northwest Florida Gulf Coast near Fort<br>wal Beach there's a photograph of it as<br>you can<br>see you know they they nest in regions<br>where you have a lot of tourists I mean<br>that's a multi-story condominium it's<br>kind of many up down the beach uh during<br>much of of the day this place would be<br>full of people and that keeps the uh so<br>keeps people out the nest is inside of<br>there and that's another<br>that's looks like we have very nice<br>beaches around there by the way except<br>our water in the summer is more like<br>here so we collected five sand samples<br>in proximity to the nest uh one was<br>collected from sand under the seawater<br>at about the time of low tide one of us<br>from the interner tidal Zone uh during<br>the low tide low tide period one was<br>from Sand slightly above the high tide<br>limit one was from sand that was near<br>Sand Dunes that was way above the high<br>tide limit and one was in close<br>proximity to the active citral nesting<br>site and um from each of those we<br>collected approximately two grams of<br>sand that we actually measure and got<br>the exact<br>mass and with the sensor we measured the<br>conductance converted that to ec25 we<br>can back out the S the salt mass then<br>determine the ratio of of mass of salt<br>per a milligram gram of sand and go<br>through and get your readings there and<br>basically what we proved was that we<br>could do these same tests with two grams<br>of stand as opposed to 50 grams of sand<br>so we can significant reduce the amount<br>of required sand to get the same<br>results and this was this was published<br>conference another project I've been<br>involved in uh for the past eight years<br>is that this one's actually ongoing uh<br>this was basically to to see if we could<br>apply my sensor technology to<br>environments monitoring environmental<br>conditions at Alpine and some Alpine<br>lake so this was a project that got<br>approved by Rocky Mountain National Park<br>and began working on in<br>2016 and what what actually showed up<br>was it became very effective at looking<br>at the residual effects of forest<br>fires um in 2020 you had in October 2020<br>you had the East Troublesome wildfire<br>and the Cameron Peak Wildfire which were<br>the two largest wildfires in Colorado<br>History uh they burned over hundreds of<br>thousands of Acres of of forest land<br>including 30,000 Acres inside the park<br>itself and I I go every year and collect<br>water samples from the Lakes they've<br>asked me to work in in late August so<br>this happened not long after I was there<br>in<br>2020 now here's the sensor and that that<br>should look familiar but is the same<br>sensor I used last time uh one of the<br>things I do is I use the same sensors<br>over and over and just for new<br>applications so there's basically zero<br>development cost to go from that project<br>to this<br>project uh once it's the same sensor uh<br>the way I tested these I brought the<br>samples back to my lab and I basically<br>used a coax cable and connect it to the<br>SMA connector and hook it up to the low<br>frequency impedance analyzer in my um in<br>my<br>lab even with the connector the sensor<br>so for sample collection this is<br>something our couldn't send a graduate<br>student to do I have to go out and do<br>this myself so I go out there and I I<br>stay in a cabin in the park that the<br>park that's been staying for free for<br>about a week and I do about a week's<br>worth of hiking and I collect water<br>samples at all these Alpine and<br>subalpine<br>lakes um I'm not sure what the highest<br>elevation is here but you know there<br>it's the highest one is over 3500 m<br>so it's it takes me a couple days to<br>adjust to the elevation so of course I<br>do that by hiking while I'm there so you<br>haven't notice I enjoy hiking so I go<br>out there and I C water samples from all<br>these flakes in 100 now 125 Mill sample<br>bottles now the Lakes they asked me to<br>work at are in What's called the<br>Lakeville drainage in that wed and<br>there's four lakes you've got um the<br>lock Lake of blast Sky Pond Andrews Tarn<br>Sky Pond flows into Lake of glass which<br>flows into the log and there's a a ridge<br>that separates Sky Pond from Andrew's<br>tar and Andrew's Tarn also flows<br>directly into the water so they're all<br>interconnected uh this is actually a lot<br>bigger than it looks that's a fairly<br>large glacier called Andrews Glacier and<br>um it's it has carasses in it people<br>actually go up there and ski down in the<br>summer so it's it's fairly large glacier<br>so it is it's bigger than it looks and<br>depending on the year uh that Glacier<br>may be a lot bigger than some years than<br>others uh it's somewhat small there<br>compared to previous years except it is<br>bigger than the year before um once<br>again depends a lot on the temperatures<br>that year and the precipitation so forth<br>a lot also how much snowfall they had<br>year so here's my test data um from 2016<br>through August of last<br>year and if you look at the EC for the<br>three laks Andrews turn is that's the<br>highest thing it's always got the lowest<br>DC and and by the way some of the people<br>I collaborate with that are at the USGS<br>and also a university out there have<br>compared my results with their readings<br>and they're all with the same range<br>which is some good correlation but when<br>I collected my data in 2020 it was right<br>before the wildfires occurred and as you<br>notice the EC went up significantly in<br>three of the Lakes the next year and<br>went up further the year after that and<br>all the lakes and then it started going<br>back down so basically what happened is<br>you're getting this ash fall that that<br>accumulated in the Watershed and you<br>know some of it directly into the lakes<br>and others basically started flowing<br>into the Lakes now the<br>glacier um see reduced significantly in<br>2022 compared to 2021 and of course the<br>EC went up so I'm thinking a lot of the<br>material that got trapped in the glacier<br>actually got into the lake that year and<br>and here we are a couple years later and<br>it's still elevated but starting to go<br>back down so I'm planning to continue<br>this for two more years as he goes back<br>down to this I'll call that the Baseline<br>level and there was actually you know<br>fluctuation from year to year based upon<br>if they were in drought or not<br>so a little more explaining the data<br>wood ash principal constituents or<br>calcium carbonate and poach poach<br>dissolves in water calcium carbonate<br>will dissolve in water if water is<br>saturated with CO2 so you're getting<br>both of those in there and Alpine Lake<br>water normally is a very low dissolved<br>ion content pre-fire uh itson content<br>was not much higher than<br>rainwater um the ash accumulation into<br>the Watershed is basically raised e SE<br>all four lakes it's it's remained<br>elevated for the past three years I'm<br>testing that here's a photo I pulled off<br>the internet showing what it looked like<br>in the area while the firks were going<br>on so and I I published some on some of<br>the previous work in the early brother<br>there next I want to talk about sensors<br>using the insulated interdigitated<br>electrode sensors uh these are basically<br>that planer interdigitated or ID<br>structure I mentioned before it's like<br>the two hair combs that are where the<br>tines are interdigitated together uh<br>that's a photograph of one of them and<br>this is a drawing of it and basically<br>with this type of structure a sizable<br>percentage of the capacitance between<br>the two electrodes are due to the out of<br>plane fringing fields and when you have<br>a material or sub<br>that that enters those fringing fields<br>that will be basically right above the<br>circuit board if it has a a dilat<br>constant or relative permitivity that's<br>greater than air it increases the<br>capacities so this is very useful for<br>content uh this is something that sort<br>of just demonstrates the sensor but it's<br>not really applicable to anything uh you<br>can actually use this to measure the<br>massive drop of<br>water do are constant of water room<br>temperature is about 80 and the uh<br>polymeric coating the solder mask is<br>mostly hydrophilic so a a drop of water<br>tends to beat up on it and with this<br>type of sensor the sensor's capacitance<br>is lineally proportional to the mass of<br>the<br>drop as shown right there here is a<br>fairly large drop after adding start of<br>the small drop and adding drops to it<br>here's the measure measure capacitance<br>versus the mass of the drop of water so<br>you know from the you can kind of<br>speculate we could use that to measure<br>moisture content of soil or sand or<br>other materials and that's exactly what<br>started doing uh one of the first<br>applications was measuring the moisture<br>content in soil and of course this could<br>apply to agriculture could be to Drought<br>monitoring uh construction actually this<br>first project actually worked to our<br>civil engineering department because<br>they needed a sensor that would do this<br>for construction<br>purposes actually what they were doing<br>is they were experimenting with some<br>material some uh ch chemicals put at the<br>ground to help with liquefaction during<br>earthquakes and they wanted to use a<br>radar system to go through and find out<br>where that material flows before it<br>hardens and to do that they needed to<br>measure the do constant of the soil so<br>that's where the sensor came from and<br>also we discover it worked very well at<br>measuring the moisture<br>content so with this type of sensor and<br>here's a photograph of that<br>sensor uh the Capac sensor is<br>proportional to the materials dric<br>constant and for air that's about one<br>for dry soil the desert constant is<br>about 1.7 and 2.5 however at root<br>temperature for liquid water to about<br>80 so by measur the Capac you can<br>estimate the water<br>content and here's a plot of our test<br>data and this is was with a clay based<br>soil and we measured the the water<br>content between Zer and about<br>32.5% by weight water content above<br>about 32.5% the water was separate from<br>the soil so we didn't look at it you<br>know for that range and as you can see<br>we had a nice linear<br>response and we published this work in a<br>2012 another application was a a<br>wireless hay Bill curing status sensor<br>Suite now as most people here probably<br>know uh freshly cut hay needs to dry<br>below about 20% moisture content for<br>bailing otherwise you have a real risk<br>of developing hay Bell fires um if the<br>moisture content is above about<br>20% Then you it starts to heat up part<br>of that's because you get exothermic<br>respiration in In Living plant cells<br>that are in the hay and part of that's<br>because you have bacteria that like<br>conditions mesophilic bacteria Will<br>Survive up to about 60 degrees C<br>thermophile bacteria Will Survive well<br>beyond that and once you get to about 82<br>de see you can get a spontaneous<br>combustion of the hay and that's a big<br>problem in the US and I'm sure it's a<br>too so we developed a sensor Suite that<br>would do that we used one of my moisture<br>content sensors and integrate into that<br>a temperature sensor and connected that<br>with a microcontroller that has a Wi-Fi<br>interface put that in the housing with a<br>batteries resulting in this prototype<br>right here now my grad students kind of<br>refer to that as the pipe bomb but it's<br>it's not really a pipe bomb but it does<br>fit nicely into the hay uh this is one<br>of my former PhD students he's probably<br>about 25 there people say he looks like<br>he's about 14 so I could sell this as<br>come to grad school and you won't age<br>I'm trying to get more grad students so<br>he he finished his Doctorate about four<br>or five years<br>ago so basically the product you put in<br>the hay bale and communicates to<br>moisture content temperature to the<br>farmer cell phone over about the 6 week<br>curing time the actual sensor is only<br>about that big the rest of that are the<br>c-size batteries it takes to power for<br>six weeks of continuous operation uh<br>it's very low cost um we developed an<br>app forward on your phone and I<br>apologize but us Farmers want Fahrenheit<br>so that's why it's a Fahrenheit and we<br>this was tested during the winter which<br>is why it's below freezing there U but<br>it basically will send that every time<br>you paint it and it can warn you if the<br>conditions are such that it's a risk of<br>a fire so we we published some of this<br>2018 another application was measuring<br>the moisture content of stored grains so<br>for that we developed a large relatively<br>large uh PCB capacitive sensor for doing<br>that uh one of the nice things about<br>printed circuit boards is you can get<br>them very large compared to M's devices<br>so for applications where you've got<br>relatively large items you're working<br>with like BK kernels and corn is really<br>advantage over Mims<br>technology so for this we we took corn<br>kernels and we soaked them in tap water<br>room temperature for 24 hours and every<br>six hours in that 24 hour soap we would<br>take the corn cornels off out thy them<br>off it's a good task for graduate<br>students uh then measure measure uh we<br>had 50 we selected and marked that were<br>representative ones inside a much larger<br>bulk uh individually measure the mass of<br>each one of those as they IDE water and<br>then measure the but capacitance and<br>then put them back into continue the<br>soak and then we compared the sensor<br>capacitance with the mass of the kernels<br>as they bued water and got a linear<br>correlation so there's capacitance<br>versus average chal weight um and uh you<br>know from that we could basically back<br>you know determine how much water<br>cornels had had in and one of the things<br>we noticed is and there's actually a<br>photograph of the test set up while<br>we're testing the<br>sensor uh we observed there was a<br>significant variation in the individual<br>kernels between size shape and Diving<br>characteristics so there's a lot of<br>scatter in the data but nevertheless a<br>discernable<br>Trend and one of the things that also<br>came out of that we did as a further<br>study was we noticed there is a<br>orientation dependence on how you place<br>the sensor in B corn to measure the<br>moisture<br>concept uh the corn kernel shape results<br>in a sensor orientation dependence<br>because for kernels tend to orient such<br>as to minimize their potential energy<br>and with that means is basically the<br>side that the largest area tends to to<br>fall and remain such that it's normal to<br>the direction of gravity so in other<br>words looking down at the beaker they<br>they tend to arrange like that obviously<br>all of them don't but a lot of them do<br>enough to where it affects how you place<br>the sensor and if you place a sensor in<br>the corn horizontally it has much higher<br>sensitivity than if you place it<br>vertically and this one actually shows<br>changeing capacitance versus moisture<br>content uh for the the first study that<br>was a study I worked on with NASA and<br>they were interested basically in you<br>know how does you know grain change if<br>it's sayfe stored in the space station<br>whereas here we're looking more<br>agricultural applications so we<br>basically measure the moisture content<br>with an RF moisture content meter<br>commercial for that and I would like to<br>go through some point and do some<br>further studies where look at other<br>crops such as soybeans which tend to be<br>rounder or or maybe rice where this may<br>be even more uh more of an<br>issue and we we published this fairly<br>recently<br>too another area this censor works with<br>is for electrochemical impedance<br>spectroscopy or Eis uh dissolved ions in<br>water form large hydration spheres that<br>mechanically they bring they behave like<br>a spring Mass damper system and they<br>have and as a result they have a<br>characteristic resident<br>frequency and hydration spheres are<br>they're sensitive electrically because<br>water is a diapal molecule and they will<br>basically vibrate if electric energy is<br>supplied at the resonant<br>frequency and basically if you change<br>electrical properties of the solution it<br>will change that frequency<br>accordingly and of course that also<br>depends on the ion species and the<br>concentration so I de I took one of<br>these sensors and put it in a an aqu<br>solution and then swept it over a wi<br>frequency range and that reveals a plot<br>that you can use to help identify what<br>your chemistry<br>is so here is the sensor for that and<br>that should look very similar to the<br>sensor I passed around except I've added<br>the University of lito logo on it um<br>once again I like to reuse sensors for<br>new<br>applications and to evaluate this one I<br>connected up to a an agilant Network<br>analyzer swept it between 100 khz and 50<br>megahertz<br>and this particular sensor was designed<br>so it fits in those ning water bottles I<br>like to use to test samples<br>in that's a photograph of the test set<br>up so the first test I did was to get a<br>lot of different aquous solutions and<br>see is there any difference and uh this<br>is capacitance versus frequency for a<br>bunch of different solutions uh tap is<br>tap water AMU is ammonium sulfate<br>fertiliz into water PO is water from the<br>Pacific Ocean bleach is is a bleach<br>water solution I got Rain Is Still Water<br>SS is water from the Sut and sea the Sut<br>and sea is a hypersaline very polluted<br>uh Inner Sea in eastern California so<br>out there we got a sample of that uh<br>1011 is 1011 fertilizer and water the is<br>water and ammonia and ammonia water<br>solution and what you see here is that<br>you get these characteristic signatures<br>where you've got a a a peak magnitude<br>and Peak frequency and basically that<br>changes based upon the<br>chemistry now this is not like a mass<br>spec where you can determine everything<br>that's in it but if you have some idea<br>of what the solutions you're looking at<br>changes now where I applied this was to<br>look at measuring nitrates in<br>solution um so we prepared a number of<br>different nitrate Solutions in di water<br>we looked at potassium nitrate ammonium<br>nitrate and sodium nitrate and all had<br>similar characteristics uh this is the<br>evaluation of potassium nitrate in di<br>water from concentrations of zero to 160<br>parts per million what you see is you<br>get a a series of Peaks so as the<br>concentration goes up your Peak<br>magnitude decreases and so does the<br>frequency and that makes sense<br>and that the peak would decrease because<br>you've got basically a higher damped you<br>think about this mechanical system<br>higher damp mechanical system and as the<br>hydration shells uh get<br>larger you basically have a lower<br>frequency because the mass is<br>higher so from that we could back out<br>characteristic equations where you could<br>you could determine the concentration in<br>this case of potassium nitrate is either<br>function of that resonant Peak frequency<br>or its<br>magnitude so with this type of of sensor<br>you could go through if you know some<br>other things about your environment<br>calibrate from temperature and you could<br>present another application of the same<br>sensor is for detecting ice or icing<br>conditions uh water and ice have a large<br>dilri constant below What's called the<br>dric relaxation frequency<br>and uh uh but it has a small D constant<br>above the the D relaxation frequency now<br>for water that that frequency is about<br>10 gahz so it's very high however for<br>ice it's approximately 3 KZ and as a<br>temperature by SPS it actually goes down<br>further so what we did is with this<br>sensor is we measure the capacitance at<br>1 KZ and it's 64 khz and then compute<br>the ratio and we discover If the ratio<br>is greater than two than it's an ice<br>water so we tested that with water and<br>ice over a range um ice down to minus 30<br>C and water up to 34 C in awesome dry<br>conditions and in every one of those if<br>it's ice your ratio is greater than two<br>if it's dry or wet then it's less than<br>two this is a very handy way of<br>detecting ice and one of the goals see<br>if I can back up up here one of the<br>goals this eventually is to come up with<br>an RFID tag with a sensor on it you put<br>on a bridge and say a truck or a car<br>goes by there it continue there's icing<br>on the bridge so that's just one of the<br>eventually and the last one of the three<br>is insulated planer inductor sensors uh<br>this basically use a planer inductor<br>that generates a 3D magnetic field<br>around it and if there's a fertic<br>material that that interacts with that<br>3D magnetic field that will tend<br>increase<br>inductance however if it is a a solid<br>metallic structure that's ferromagnetic<br>you also get Edie currents which tend to<br>decrease the inductance but if your<br>fomic material is granular uh then<br>basically there there's not much any<br>current you to see an increase in<br>inductance if you put a<br>non-conductive uh or a conductive nonfer<br>material say aluminum in there<br>then you'll get a decrease in inductance<br>material and some work that that I did<br>with Rachel here um about a year ago was<br>to see if we could detect iron based<br>rust in sand and this was for<br>applications in coastal regions where<br>you had a very corrosive environment but<br>you might also have iron or steel based<br>structures that might tend to<br>rust uh when you have iron corrosion<br>products they primarily consist their<br>flakes of iron with we ferromagnetic<br>feric oxide which is the red rust that<br>we're all familiar with so for that<br>developed a um little PB uh PCB sensor<br>with a little planer inductor structure<br>in<br>it so we tested that in a variety of of<br>Beric oxide and rust samples and we<br>observed was that between<br>0% rust up to about 75% rust<br>concentration in sand you got a nice<br>linear increase then and after that it<br>saturates so with this you could very<br>easily detect that you're getting rust<br>in in in say a beach<br>year now one last thing I'm going to<br>talk about which is a littleit slightly<br>different is a unit called the<br>gatorbite and uh this is a water quality<br>mapping boy that was developed for<br>locating Watershed pollution sources and<br>it's similar to the one that some of you<br>guys worked on just you know done in<br>parallel without knowledge of either<br>either other person working on it um<br>it's basically it's got temperature pH<br>EC and dissolve oxygen sensors it has an<br>AR microcontroller it does GPS<br>mapping um sensor readings and GPS<br>locations are timestamped and it's got<br>cular connectivity and it's in a 3D<br>printed housing basically put it in a a<br>river or a stream it will float down and<br>collect data real time and the uh point<br>of contact for this is Dr even Bean at<br>University of Florida and uh he said he<br>would love to work with you guys on on<br>this and he came to me I wanted to look<br>at see if we could integrate some of my<br>sensors into it to augment escapability<br>on future iterations of<br>it and my involvement with that one<br>though was in<br>testine um back in April of 2022 uh even<br>came to Auburn and we did some testing<br>in Chaka Creek and that actually runs by<br>my property so right there we're putting<br>it in on my property uh it went down a<br>couple kilometers past other property<br>into the state park that we got<br>permission to do sampling in and that's<br>it basically floating down and we were<br>collecting data real time that one was<br>actually presented in 20122 at a<br>conference<br>so so in conclusion multiple<br>environmental sensing applications exist<br>and many of these applications can<br>benefit from lowcost sensors and I<br>believe that PR circuit board technology<br>allows you to make low cost sensors for<br>those applications and I believe they're<br>low enough to cost and sufficiently<br>accurate for um applications such as<br>where you need a lot of of deployed<br>sensors or one one time use laboratory<br>applications or anything else really can<br>just be<br>disposable so thank you very much and<br>questions<br>sorry per I missed it your Gator bite<br>looks<br>awesome is it tted or basic do you have<br>to follow it like could it get lost in<br>the trees in the side of the bank or<br>does it well we followed it down he<br>actually he put waiters on it followed<br>it in the water the rest of us just kind<br>of followed to make sure he he was okay<br>um it did get stuck in some edes you<br>have to go and kind of push it out of<br>there I think once it there were some<br>limbs hanging in it got stuck so but it<br>send you its location does yes yeah it's<br>connected to your cell phone and just it<br>it sends you where it is how close would<br>you have to be to get that oh well<br>what's with a cular as long as there<br>aular Network you could be many<br>kilometers away and still talk with it<br>and it also has a um a like an SD card<br>on it in case it loses connectivity so<br>it stores the<br>data a uh interesting kind of dangerous<br>story uh our state park is right next to<br>a limestone Corry and of course they<br>pump the water out of it that caused a<br>bunch of sink holes end up having to<br>close off part of the park big lawsuit<br>resulted and um the creek kind of goes<br>along there around the close part of the<br>park and myself and other other faculty<br>members were along the banks just to<br>make sure nothing bad happened I mean<br>it's April we have venomous snakes I'm<br>like you guys we have alligators um he<br>disappeared and we were getting kind of<br>concerned and we found a later he was<br>completely soaked he had stepped into a<br>sinkhole in the creek so he went from<br>being like Wast deep to well over his<br>head but he thinkk he was able to get<br>out because we just we would have any<br>idea where he was so but he basically<br>was his baby he followed it down to make<br>sure it didn't get stuck or lost or<br>anything How much would it cost to put<br>one of those<br>together I would have to ask him about<br>that everything was off the shelf except<br>they 3D printed the um you know the<br>housing<br>food his goal was to make them very<br>inexpensive so a lot of people could<br>have them and I believe he set this up<br>too any other<br>questions another question um so you<br>mentioned the the clay on and the soil<br>composition of the Interior digitary<br>digitated um electrode um<br>do silt and sand contents also matter in<br>I would say probably not if you had a<br>lot of iron content in your soil that<br>that might affect it um but no as far as<br>the silic content I don't think that<br>much question for you so what about<br>calibration of your sensus because<br>obviously you're getting a lot of data<br>back yeah what I try to do is purchase<br>commercial sensors and use those to<br>calibrate them they pretty no dramas<br>yes yes question in terms of the um I<br>did I think you mentioned on your<br>conclusions that there quite for<br>disposable filed you<br>so how you know they're going something<br>going to quite harsh environments and<br>you've got them on a PCB is what they<br>sort of<br>Longevity if you s of St one of these<br>into soil<br>or water or whatever you found we have<br>we have done some soil testing for them<br>um long term and they seem to work<br>pretty well there<br>and um in fact some of the commercial<br>manufacturers now of soil moisture<br>condens sensors use print circuit boards<br>so that they will work for that<br>application um I have done some tests<br>where I did immersion of the sensors in<br>sea water to see does it affect the<br>metal and so forth and um the tin plated<br>PL what was the what was the loow<br>sensitivity of the nitrate<br>that uh for this test the lowest that we<br>measured was the um 10 parts per million<br>um but it was the peak dropped<br>significantly between that and the water<br>that um kind of on the same kind of<br>scale of things<br>um is there an idea so a lot of the<br>tests seem to be you take a sense<br>and you um use it for um to kind of<br>collect data from a sample um so are<br>there are there ideas of having like um<br>sensor arrays for site for field sites<br>and kind of using them like that yes<br>there are plenty of ideas for that uh<br>let me point out with the exception of<br>the hayt sensor the rest of these were<br>all IUN them myself all with internal<br>funding so getting a sensor and doing<br>some tests with one is really cheap if I<br>want to do a large fielded one there<br>that requires you know larger amounts of<br>money like an ex grant for<br>that so yeah in my country if you're not<br>doing work that's like directly<br>applicable to the Department of Defense<br>it's hard to get funding and most this<br>they don't really care about so but you<br>know for me I enjoy it it's it's it's<br>Innovative it's interesting I can get<br>it yes well your rust sense so what<br>caused the saturation do you<br>that I'm not sure but it was consistent<br>among a lot of tests<br>um I don't know if you're<br>it could be you're getting enough<br>material there towards like saturating<br>the<br>core you're getting the num effects of<br>that I'm not really sure what caused<br>observable but but do do you need to<br>read to the third decimal place to get<br>the the the measurement that means you<br>doing have to take the sample into the<br>lab to do<br>measure well I mean yeah if I<br>wonder uh I took these well these were<br>all lab repaired samples that I did Ian<br>you know the goal would be to use it you<br>know at in the field but for verifying<br>laboratory have question so um because<br>obviously every single sensor would have<br>to be calibrated<br>have you done characterization of<br>sensors order from the same facility<br>within the same cross B across<br>facilities to see whether you need to do<br>this calibration individually or as long<br>as the design is the same are<br>manufacturing processes are sufficient<br>that the tolerances are really tight um<br>it depends on the sensor the the EC<br>sensors I've done multiple ones of those<br>and get the same results for the<br>fringing field excuse me for the<br>fringing field sensors there is some<br>calibration needed but they're really<br>easy to calibrate I mean if you put them<br>in air and then di water and you can<br>calibrate them very quickly so you can<br>and by adding a temperature sensor you<br>can easily calibrate out temperature<br>effects so they're not difficult to<br>calibrate do need to some of them do<br>need to be individually calibrated if<br>you want a really precise reading yes if<br>you're looking you know for thresholds<br>then you probably<br>don't<br>yes if you can tell us is there a sensor<br>that doesn't exist yet that would be<br>ideal that would work with um PCB<br>technology that<br>um that would be the next kind of<br>amazing um<br>environmental uh monitoring<br>Environmental Research device<br>or is that still something that you're<br>working on I I don't know the answer to<br>that that that would kind of be like you<br>know what is needed from the expermental<br>side because you know I'm I'm an<br>electrical engineer that dabbles to<br>environmental science and geology and<br>these other and weather in these other<br>areas um I just look for I look for<br>applications to apply the sensor<br>technology to so if someone has an<br>application let me know what that is and<br>I can I can think about can I build a<br>that<br>anybody<br>else well um so we as part of er would<br>be um very are very grateful of you um<br>um just<br>a oh wow great interview that was<br>awesome<br>much thank<br>you<br>off</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
