learning<br>and it's just about having an open mind<br>and their understanding that the the<br>journey is massive it's long but just<br>embracing it and just letting him take<br>the lead we always have a saying in our<br>house that we could take to lead and we<br>follow yeah yeah it's um for our family<br>it's it's the whole village<br>um and you know what I don't even want<br>to put a Pacific lens on there that's<br>just I think that's just the way that<br>we've run things is that Victor's used<br>to a large number of people being around<br>them so when he's with maybe one or two<br>people I wonder where my family is but<br>yeah he definitely does grow up in a<br>religion well not on this Journey<br>ourselves it's our whole entire village<br>we are proud parents of an autistic<br>child we also lead the passage support<br>group down here in Wellington so it's a<br>Pacifica autism support group based in<br>Wellington but was founded in Auckland<br>um we are here to support our parents on<br>the journey um who come from Pacific<br>backgrounds<br>autism to me is a as an autistic person<br>it's it's it's a part of who I am it's<br>it's it's something that makes me me<br>um because autism as much as we Define<br>it the diagnostic process defines it as<br>a set of behaviors<br>um but to me it's how I perceive the<br>world it's how I take in the information<br>how my brain processes it how I spit it<br>out the other side and whatever form<br>that might be and I think I often say I<br>I view my autism as net neutral<br>um it's neither positive nor negative it<br>just is a part of me um<br>hi I'm Beth I am an autistic adult and I<br>sit on a number of advisory panels for<br>the vuw autism clinic and autism New<br>Zealand and I am a student just<br>finishing up my studies in built<br>environment accessibility<br>um specifically for autistic people<br>I say I am autistic just like I would<br>say I am tall or I am creative or I am a<br>New Zealander or I am female and all of<br>those things are part of me so autism is<br>is another part of me and I don't think<br>that saying I am autistic means that<br>that is the only thing that can Define<br>me because like no one tells me that if<br>I say I am female that that must be then<br>the only thing that defines me<br>um and just like me saying I am tall<br>being tall has its benefits you know I<br>can reach things in high cupboards it<br>makes fitting in the car a bit hard you<br>know it's got its pros it's got its cons<br>but it's it's neither it's just who I am<br>I can't change that about myself so I'm<br>not autistic myself but I do have<br>autistic whanau members and so much of<br>what you're both saying I think really<br>resonates with me in terms of<br>um that Learning Journey that you're<br>always on always wanting to kind of find<br>ways to better support and understand<br>and accept your whanau members<br>Kia Ora I'm Hannah Waddington and I'm a<br>senior lecturer at teheringawaka I'm<br>also the clinic lead of the Victoria<br>University of Wellington autism clinic<br>um yeah I have uh several autistic<br>cousins so I grew up alongside them and<br>I just always found them such<br>interesting cool awesome people you know<br>and I saw all of their strengths all of<br>their cool fascinating interests like<br>um but I also saw some areas for<br>Challenge and some areas for support you<br>know so that's really one of the things<br>that actually led me into this field was<br>kind of<br>um getting to know my own funnel members<br>and trying to find<br>um those really helpful ways of<br>supporting other autistic people too<br>okay again<br>um<br>the definition of neurodiversity at the<br>end of the day is is that there are lots<br>of different brains in the world that<br>all function in slightly different ways<br>and no one brain is better than the<br>other or worse than the other we just<br>have different brains and we should work<br>with different brains to let them be the<br>best brain that they can be so I think I<br>can sometimes describe it as like a<br>library<br>um where if each person is a book<br>um there are different genres in a<br>library and so autistic people might be<br>one genre and and neurotypical people<br>might be another and dyslexia people<br>might be another and people with ADHD<br>might be another<br>um in each of those books within that<br>genre are different they have different<br>storylines they have different<br>experiences but no one's sort of well<br>probably some people do say that like<br>sci-fi is better than romance but you<br>know it's like no one tells the library<br>oh no you shouldn't stop any of those<br>books because those books are just all<br>terrible<br>um like we all accept that libraries<br>stock books that we we like or we don't<br>like or in terms of brains we a brain be<br>able to bring we don't at the end of the<br>day it just it's kind of like that so um<br>yeah at the end of the day I think<br>neurodiversity kind of comes down<br>or what does it mean mean to me is it's<br>about not trying to change people for<br>being different yeah or or that it's<br>about understanding that yeah that we<br>need diversity in life um like if all<br>the plants in the world were all the<br>same then they would all die off from<br>the same disease right that like<br>diversity is really important<br>um but in society we quite like things<br>like Society quite likes everyone to fit<br>in a little box yeah absolutely and and<br>and so that neurodiversity sort of says<br>actually we don't all fit in little<br>boxes and that should be seen as a good<br>thing as opposed to<br>or we should make them all fit into the<br>same little box so for me I think you've<br>actually and other autistic adults<br>really helped me along this journey so I<br>think we've been touching on Journey a<br>bit throughout this Corridor<br>um but for me as a researcher I really<br>see myself still learning and really<br>wanting to learn um from autistic adults<br>within that neurodiversity thank you<br>from their very very first grumpy email<br>that you got from me you've come a very<br>I really did appreciate that yeah<br>honestly you know and I think like I<br>wouldn't call myself an expert in this<br>space at all I would call myself a<br>learner but a lot of those things that<br>you've touched on have been what I've<br>really taken away and tried to<br>um put into my research and put into my<br>practice the idea of a brain based<br>difference not looking at autism like a<br>deficit or a disorder something to<br>change and how valuable differences<br>those illustrations that you use really<br>show it the idea that<br>um you know it takes all kinds of Minds<br>to make Society function well and that's<br>actually what does make us Thrive yeah<br>and then on the flip side of things just<br>really being careful to not be trying to<br>make any children I support you know<br>conform to a certain mold just like<br>really value them yeah I've actually got<br>nothing to add everything<br>um and I love that like it's just about<br>it embracing the difference rather than<br>like you know everything has to fit into<br>this little box but yeah that's how I<br>see it is that it's massive<br>neurodiversity is massive and so it's<br>just having that open mind like we've<br>mentioned time and time again to<br>understand that this is it's massive<br>yeah<br>and it's yeah just having that<br>understanding<br>I think it is interesting sometimes<br>because sometimes one of the criticisms<br>of neurodiversity is is that it washes<br>over the hard things that that ignores<br>the concept that<br>um that that some people will really<br>find life hard with with a very very<br>diverse brain<br>um and and I I personally don't hold to<br>that I think that in fact what<br>neurodiversity says is is that maybe<br>maybe if you never communicate verbally<br>in your life maybe if you never live<br>independently you're still valuable yeah<br>um and you're still worth something as a<br>person even if you may need to hold down<br>a nine-to-five job when you never move<br>out of home or if that that doesn't like<br>it accepts that that that is the case<br>for some people it and it doesn't try<br>and say that it that that is not the<br>case<br>um so so I think it is sometimes the<br>criticism that neurodiversity just<br>washes away the challenges that some<br>people experience and I think that well<br>that's not really the goal of it the<br>goal is to say that actually even if<br>your your brain functions in a way that<br>makes living in<br>what we call modern society really<br>really hard in maybe your life looks<br>incredibly different from from what<br>might be considered a typical life that<br>you're still valuable as a person that<br>you that that that that doesn't make you<br>less than than other people but it<br>doesn't also say that you don't have<br>challenges and you don't find things<br>really really hard<br>um but I think it's worth acknowledging<br>that because that is often a criticism<br>that comes up and and it is one that I<br>mean I can see why people have that as a<br>criticism but but I would personally<br>quite disagree with it as a criticism<br>that it's not the goal of neurodiversity<br>isn't to say all brands are different<br>and they are always perfect that's not<br>what we're saying we're just saying that<br>all brains are different and all brains<br>have value regardless of what that brain<br>may or may not be able or not be able to<br>do yeah and in fact perhaps no brains<br>which is why we need lots of different<br>types<br>so health and clinicians and Educators<br>adopt a neurodiversity affirming<br>approach<br>and so this is something that um I've<br>been really reflecting on a lot um as<br>Clinic lead of this clinic and our whole<br>team has like really really been<br>um reflecting on so I'll kind of talk<br>about<br>um the clinician side of things and the<br>things that we've been doing or trying<br>to do<br>um to make sure our supports are as<br>neurodiversity affirming as possible so<br>I think<br>um one thing that I've already touched<br>on that we hold really Central is the<br>unique value that each child brings and<br>really<br>um trying to above all value them and<br>understand and accept them as their own<br>unique person who has their own yes<br>drinks and perhaps areas of Challenge<br>and support and really cool interests<br>you know that we can get involved with<br>so the idea that yeah<br>um there's not one appropriate way to<br>play if you want to play in this way<br>we'll totally roll with it if your<br>favorite thing is dinosaurs we'll learn<br>about dinosaurs we'll talk to you about<br>dinosaurs we'll all kind of get on board<br>with loving dinosaurs to together that's<br>a really key one and I think<br>we've also done a lot of thinking about<br>like what's the point of early support<br>why are we doing this and really coming<br>back to the overarching goal is to<br>improve the quality of life for that<br>tamati and the afano and to make sure<br>that Above All Else they're feeling<br>happy and safe within the sessions that<br>we provide so if it's like we're not<br>working on goals today because<br>everything's a bit much sweet as now you<br>know because we're just working on<br>forming that relationship with you<br>getting to know you and making sure you<br>feel safe another thing I think is<br>really understanding that different is<br>fine you don't have to do it in the way<br>that the neurotypical person does and<br>that the way that a child might Express<br>their emotions might be different so you<br>don't have to be happy and smiling<br>necessarily to show that you're<br>interested<br>um you might not be crying to show that<br>you're upset you know so we need to get<br>to know you and the way that you're<br>showing your emotions the way that you<br>communicate you might not be using words<br>to communicate you might be<br>communicating using your gestures you<br>might be communicating by writing um<br>things down and so really I think it's<br>about being lived now by the child by<br>the whanau and having as Beth touched on<br>the value of that person at the center<br>above all else you guys probably have a<br>bit with Educators with your so I'm<br>starting school<br>um yes but I actually wanted<br>um I'm actually going to put my wife on<br>the spot here um do you want to talk<br>about our experience our medical<br>experience with the doctors because it's<br>a really positive one yeah and it's a<br>massive shift from<br>during covert to where it is now I mean<br>if you just want to because you're way<br>better storytelling than myself<br>yeah just so<br>um our boy<br>um about a month ago we ended up in<br>hospital had a bit of a climb and for<br>the first time he missed the step and he<br>fell and Grace's face so it wasn't that<br>bad but because he didn't like the feel<br>of it picking it and picking out anyway<br>got infected so we had to go to the<br>hospital<br>um we were really pleasantly surprised<br>in their approach so the moment I told<br>them that my son is autistic straight<br>away they got a scene we got in and then<br>told him I was like you know he doesn't<br>like medicine I try to give him medicine<br>but he just he forced it back out and I<br>don't know what else to do but I don't<br>want you to put an IV in her because<br>it's going to hurt him and then they're<br>like okay cool<br>um we'll see what we can do so they had<br>a few doctors that came in and said that<br>it looks like we're gonna have to put an<br>IV in and I was just stressing and so<br>there and we had other doctors come and<br>saying actually no we will try and get<br>some antibiotics on him maybe we need a<br>Crusher and put it into his food so I<br>was like okay I like that idea so um we<br>spent a couple of days there and then we<br>had one Doctor Who was amazing I think<br>he might have been like head of<br>Department came and he goes no the last<br>we want to do is put an IV on them<br>because we do not want to traumatize<br>them but we will get a pharmacist to<br>come up and find out what um what<br>antibiotic is safe to put into food and<br>So eventually we got an antibiotic that<br>had no taste that we could crush that we<br>could dissolve and hold it and put it<br>into his milkshake and yeah he was just<br>he did not taste anything he wasn't<br>cussed or anything<br>um the nurses were amazing they put us<br>in a separate room because I told them<br>that his I'm hearing is quite sensitive<br>life is quite sensitive as well and they<br>just took everything we said you're<br>seeing him in the dark<br>light on so yeah so I think I think for<br>me around the clinician stuff the<br>awareness is definitely the education's<br>there and I think I think I was most<br>proud of how patient they were with<br>their child because like our child is<br>something else he's he's literally<br>Forever on the go so I was yeah I was um<br>I was really happy and I was really<br>surprised first happy and I've given<br>them good feedback so I think um things<br>might have been different when we were<br>because we're around the same generation<br>you know about 30s and 30s um I'm gonna<br>keep it there yeah but um I think things<br>might have shift from when you were<br>going up to where it is now so that's a<br>testament to the journey that you've<br>been on yeah and those that are you know<br>it is quite interesting though I think<br>that definitely in the Pediatric space<br>yeah there's a lot better understanding<br>better yeah what I think is still really<br>unfortunately<br>um is is that there isn't in the adult<br>space and we forget that autistic<br>children turn h8 yeah I think people who<br>work with children are getting way<br>better at it which is awesome and I'm so<br>glad to see that don't get me wrong<br>um I think it is still a bit harder when<br>you're when you're an adult trying to<br>navigate the system there isn't that<br>understanding or learning but um I mean<br>it's quite interesting it's funny we've<br>all talked about clinicians but in terms<br>of Educators<br>um obviously my my schooling was a while<br>ago now but I think<br>um when I was going through school I<br>mean I always sort of said<br>I hated school I didn't I didn't get<br>along with the other kids I was pretty<br>bright so I was way ahead and and some<br>teachers liked it some teachers didn't<br>um so I was academically ahead but<br>emotionally so far behind it wasn't<br>funny<br>um so they had to balance that which I<br>think particularly you know as a child<br>of the 90s and early 2000s that was not<br>easy for them<br>um but I think I look back on it now and<br>I can really appreciate some of the hard<br>work that they did do for me and I know<br>that I had this conversation with my dad<br>once about one of my high schools that I<br>went to and he said you know they were<br>really good at letting you participate<br>without participating I said oh what do<br>you mean he said well remember that like<br>when we had school athletic days or<br>um the school I was at would like do<br>house rugby and house swimming and you<br>know what the little competitions that<br>they run between students<br>um they would let me work in the Tuck<br>Shop that day or I was a runner for the<br>Athletics day so I would go down and<br>fetch the scores and take them back up<br>covered in face paint and dirty and<br>smelly and disgusting like it was not<br>happening but they didn't just say just<br>don't count for the day right it's like<br>it's like it would have been really easy<br>for them just to say just skip school<br>for the day just don't come it's fine<br>but instead of doing that they gave me<br>opportunities to to give me ways to to<br>participate it is a child always a<br>teenager even I couldn't see that I just<br>saw that I was being forced to go to<br>this Athletics<br>I would have just rather to have the day<br>off school<br>um but as an adult I can appreciate that<br>they were making an effort and they<br>didn't always get it right<br>um it is kind of important to to give<br>kids the opportunity to participate<br>again in that in ways that that suit<br>them in ways that it might be adapted a<br>bit<br>um and not just saying oh well you're<br>you're in the two-hour basket yeah or<br>you're just another kid and you have to<br>do what everyone else is doing because<br>that's that your child I'm the teacher<br>and you're gonna do what you're told<br>um I think there needs to be common<br>ground in there which I think hopefully<br>is happening more often there are a lot<br>a lot of parts on the education system<br>that I feel like still need a lot of<br>work<br>um because I feel like you know wouldn't<br>it be amazing if all the kids were able<br>to be in mainstream but have that<br>support that we get from these means<br>from these specialist schools in the<br>mainstream but I know that's still far<br>but we will get there<br>something like 11 11 yeah yeah but yeah<br>24 of our people in New Zealand have a<br>disability and it's less than younger<br>kids but it's still something like 18 or<br>20 and it's like so how how can you<br>justify only providing yeah yeah and<br>that's really hard to get oh yeah I've<br>heard so I think what was really amazing<br>for me when when I started at University<br>um at Victoria<br>um we went to Disability Services when<br>we were first like going through our um<br>like you know<br>um visit the university and see whether<br>you want to come to our University and<br>we went or maybe even be orientation<br>week by this point we were really<br>impressed with them when we first saw<br>them and so during orientation week my<br>mum and I we went into disability<br>services at the University and<br>sort of sat down with them and obviously<br>I have an official diagnosis so that<br>does open a few doors and I'm aware that<br>it's not always so easy for everyone<br>um but we I walked into this the<br>services and they sort of said okay well<br>what how does this affect you what do<br>you need and so we sort of sat around<br>tape like this for 30 minutes or so and<br>talked about it and they broke it all<br>down in an education plan that that you<br>know that making contact<br>UM that they would help me get in<br>contact with my lecturers and make sure<br>that they could help me pick my tutorial<br>streams without having to go to the big<br>rush that usually happened and that they<br>would be a flexible exam arrangements<br>and all this kind of stuff and I<br>definitely remember them going okay cool<br>when they printed out this form and they<br>gave it to me and said read it through<br>and sign it if you think it's all all<br>good and I said I already read it<br>through and say okay it's cool and so I<br>signed it and then the advisor signed it<br>um and she took it back and I said Okay<br>cool so so when do I find out whether<br>it's been approved or not and she kind<br>of looked at me<br>and she said<br>there there isn't we've just gone<br>through it I approve it and I tell the<br>school like your school gets in an email<br>from me saying this is what the student<br>needs and they just have to follow up<br>there was no approval process it was<br>just we sat around a table talked about<br>what I needed they wrote it down on a<br>piece of paper sent it to the school and<br>then the school just had to do stuff and<br>make that work<br>um and it was such a different<br>experience than going through the<br>schooling system where you had to fight<br>for every scrap of support<br>um to just sit around a table and say oh<br>gee and and they would make suggestions<br>or do you think this would be helpful do<br>you need helps with note taking do you<br>need help with this and so like they<br>they didn't even just like they weren't<br>like reticent about this is providing<br>support they actually were like what can<br>we do to make this a good experience for<br>you<br>absolutely great and we will tell the<br>school this is all the things they need<br>to do so I think if the schooling system<br>could more look more like that amazing<br>yeah yeah what I'm hearing from like<br>thank you that all the experiences you<br>described as positive is the idea of<br>taking the time to get to know the<br>individual to get to know the whanau to<br>get to know that child how they are and<br>then as much as possible just doing what<br>they need you know<br>which probably leads in really well to<br>my question which was how can wider<br>support and the community adopt a<br>neurodiversity affirming approach<br>because I think that that's kind of what<br>we what I'm going into here that that<br>concept of you know we don't magically<br>disappear when we turn 18 or 21<br>depending on what part of the schooling<br>system you're in because there's all the<br>support aimed at children yeah<br>and then you get dumped out the other<br>side of congratulations you've turned<br>you're an adult now and it's your life<br>your problem in day-to-day life<br>throughout your life you interact with a<br>huge range of people that it would be<br>really helpful if they were more<br>flexible and more understanding and and<br>and and more neurodiversity affirming<br>that like your GP your nurses<br>um work and income support your<br>disability support workers<br>um just the people that you know if you<br>are in a position that paid employment<br>might be an option for you then you know<br>your bosses your colleagues your office<br>makers all of those people that you're<br>going to interact with day to day my pet<br>peeve is that in society we still rely<br>on phones for everything that if you<br>want to make a doctor's appointment you<br>generally have to call and as someone<br>who does not use a phone that makes my<br>life really hard and the really<br>frustrating thing is is that online<br>booking systems exist they are there but<br>people don't like to use them and it's<br>always this really fascinating thing we<br>talk about the digital divide about like<br>people who have access to Internet and<br>not and making sure that if we shift<br>Digital Services that people who don't<br>use Digital Services still have options<br>I see it on the other side that actually<br>we're still so very dependent that<br>doesn't mean that I think that we<br>shouldn't still provide those options<br>but we should also be providing the<br>digital options because actually that<br>works for many other people<br>um my mum still has to call my like<br>she's she deals with working income on<br>my behalf she has to deal with some of<br>my support organizations on my behalf<br>she deals with insurance on my behalf<br>all of those kind of people that will<br>require a phone call to run your life<br>and<br>I'm<br>pretty capable of managing that if I<br>didn't have those barriers in place and<br>it would be so easy for those barriers<br>Notch to be in place so I think while<br>clinicians and educators are important<br>actually it needs to be much wider than<br>that and it needs to be wider than just<br>kids because kids are important and I'm<br>not saying kids are not important but<br>also we all grow up and we will all<br>eventually be autistic adults we don't<br>magically disappear so yeah I think<br>people make sometimes a lot of<br>assumptions about what my life looks<br>like because I am I I use spoken<br>language to communicate<br>um and and I have gone through like<br>academic study<br>um so there's a lot of assumptions about<br>that must mean that you have a very<br>functional life and and you don't need<br>much support and that's really<br>um that you're just high functioning and<br>you're not what my kid will look like<br>and I'm like well<br>hey your kid will never look like me<br>because your kid will look what they<br>look like and that's great that's the<br>point of neurodiversity but also I mean<br>I rely on disability support to help me<br>live my life I have support workers that<br>come in and help me plan my meals for<br>the week and<br>um and make sure that I'm getting<br>exercise because I'm not very fond of<br>exercise<br>um and help me manage my diabetes and<br>I've just moved back in under leave my<br>parents into a unit that we've built for<br>me to live in long term so you know this<br>whole idea of an independent life that<br>that like you hear lots of people<br>parents go well what if my kid never<br>moves out of home and all that and I'm<br>like well they might not and you know<br>what that's that that doesn't mean I<br>always say it doesn't necessarily mean I<br>have a bad life I don't I don't not like<br>my life because I'm still quite I mean<br>sometimes it frustrates me that I'm<br>still so depicted of ideas and I think<br>it definitely frustrates my parents<br>sometimes that they wish that they had<br>to do a little less<br>um but you know but that I mean I I have<br>hobbies and and I do things and I have<br>friends and I have support workers that<br>support me to do that and and no I don't<br>live an independent life but that<br>doesn't make my life bad and I think<br>that there's this this societal thing<br>and I think at least<br>um but I think it's also very a<br>eurocentric idea of of you know that<br>each person is an individual and they<br>must support themselves and be<br>independent and I think that at least is<br>hopefully a little different in the in<br>the Pacific space whereas<br>um that<br>relying on support doesn't mean that<br>your life is a failure right that<br>actually yes a five-year-old kid when I<br>grew up and maybe they don't move out of<br>home and maybe they do continue to need<br>disability support for the rest of their<br>life that doesn't mean they can't be<br>happy and have interests and hobbies and<br>friends and all of those kind of things<br>you can have a good life while being<br>codependent<br>um and I think that that's something I<br>really like to get across to parents<br>their life will look really different<br>and it'll be really miserable and<br>they'll never hold a job and they'll<br>never live alone and they'll never be<br>able to do things all on their own and<br>I'm like well you know hey you don't<br>know that's true but also B if they<br>don't<br>so what yeah they are still valuable and<br>they're still neurodiverse and they<br>still are valuable and they're still<br>amazing people who have amazing brains<br>and and you know that's where you come<br>back to this whole concept of<br>neurodiversity of that that you know<br>it's great yeah there's so many things<br>that I'd like to kind of touch on yeah<br>um so the first one is in some research<br>that I recently did<br>um it was in aotearoa and Australia it<br>was really nice because<br>autistic people whanau and professionals<br>were actually much more aligned than you<br>can sometimes think you know it's<br>actually not a kind of um which I think<br>is so exciting about this um kind of<br>chat we're having here today too there's<br>actually a lot of areas of agreement and<br>we're I'd love to see us like on a<br>journey together<br>um and so when I think as well about<br>um the broader Community what I want<br>them to know is all those things that<br>Beth is saying you know<br>um that to be neurodivergent is to have<br>a different brain<br>um that's not bad that's not bad that's<br>not worse that's just different<br>um and it's like if I'm talking to my<br>friends or things you know like they're<br>like oh I've got an autistic person at<br>my workplace what should I be doing<br>um it's just that it's totally fine for<br>people to be different from you<br>different from neurotypical if it's not<br>hurting themselves or anyone else can't<br>we just roll<br>to make those to listen and to make<br>those modifications we're needed in to<br>be okay that different people need<br>different things to be in different<br>spaces<br>and that's the message we always put<br>across with passage as you know<br>um<br>don't like the just treat them like you<br>know like who they are this is who they<br>are this is what the boy is going to be<br>like you I always hear like like people<br>like so what age do they start growing<br>I'm like they do not grow out of it this<br>is who they are but yeah um I think<br>that's the one thing that we love about<br>passage is that now we're able to spread<br>the mess like this message and we're<br>able to share our stories and by sharing<br>these stories we have with our families<br>it's it's it's given like so much<br>um knowledge and like you know it's<br>educated a lot of people around us that<br>now you know they're accepting it and<br>they're just like embracing the journey<br>that we're on and embracing the<br>uniqueness of our children who become<br>adults yeah and that's the funny thing<br>is that even among like if you looked I<br>always like people get so hung up on on<br>maybe my kids a bit behind or maybe<br>maybe they're not meeting their goals<br>right on time or there and it's like<br>well you know what no person in their<br>life is the same at 20 as they were at<br>five like why do we look at<br>five-year-olds who are autistic and say<br>this is what your life is going to look<br>like because of a diagnosis actually<br>that diagnosis does not at all translate<br>to what your life is gonna look like<br>maybe you might never speak but you live<br>in an awesome flat with some other<br>people who also don't use spoken<br>language and have a great support team<br>around you and have a job doing<br>something that you really enjoy and and<br>maybe it isn't an office job but it's<br>something that was designed specifically<br>for you but your life is meaning and<br>value and some people who use spoken<br>language and and are really good at<br>academics they end up living underneath<br>yeah<br>um but like but yeah that like like and<br>I mean you're not the same person at 30<br>as you are at 20 even so and the idea<br>that somehow as well that that we grew<br>up into autistic adults but also we<br>don't stop magically growing at 18. just<br>like all people don't like who who here<br>would say that they're the same person<br>at whatever age you are now as you were<br>at 18. thank goodness yeah I know right<br>we like we we all pursue and yeah and as<br>an autistic person our road might be a<br>little bit windier sometimes and<br>sometimes it has little hairpin Tunes<br>where we go backwards for a little bit<br>and and maybe we're not quite as far<br>along that road when we get to 18 or 30<br>or 50 but wherever that road ends up<br>going cool yeah<br>um and and yeah that yeah this that we<br>we lock autistic children into boxes<br>when they're very little where we could<br>just be like hey grow and grow in ways<br>that suit you and and we're not going to<br>force one kind of Ideal upon you that<br>you can kind of learn and grow and we'll<br>give you skills as you come along so<br>that<br>um you can choose whether or not to use<br>them I mean I I got social skills<br>training they used to call it social<br>skills training but also I do somewhat<br>appreciate that I was old enough when I<br>was taught those skills that I could<br>choose whether to use them or not<br>because actually it is very valuable<br>sometimes you need to be able to choose<br>in a certain situation it will work in<br>my favor<br>to put my smiley face on<br>and do all of my mental maths to figure<br>out what I'm supposed to be saying and<br>how I'm supposed to be saying it and<br>what turn of voice and being calm and<br>measuring everything and then I go home<br>and have a complete meltdown but<br>sometimes I want to do that in that<br>moment like put a mask on actually<br>sometimes that makes my life easier for<br>20 minutes or for an hour or for a day<br>to use those skills than I have been<br>taught but I think that's where I think<br>it's good to teach them once people are<br>old enough to choose for themselves<br>whether that's what they want to do or<br>not which is I think sometimes weird<br>when we're teaching social skills to<br>like Little Tots it's like you're just<br>doing what you're told you're not<br>getting an option of whether you want to<br>or not so yeah it's kind of I'm I'm not<br>as anti-social skills as some people are<br>because I can see the value on living<br>being taught how neurotypical people<br>interact with each other and I can<br>choose whether or not that I want to<br>interact in that way yeah as and when it<br>suits me<br>I love hearing that because we with our<br>boy we let him we can't we let him lead<br>the way and we'll follow what he does<br>and I mean sometimes I'm like am I like<br>giving him too much Freedom like but not<br>like I just hit him like you know we<br>always like he leads our play we play<br>with them we can't answer what we just<br>at the characters out we just love it we<br>probably look silly on the side of the<br>road acting up these characters but like<br>this is what he loves this is what puts<br>a smile on his face and this is what<br>keeps him happy and calm and so we just<br>go with it and it's just I think once<br>you accept the fact that your child is<br>autistic everything else just becomes so<br>much easier and you want to find things<br>to help support them and make it easier<br>for them you're not always going to get<br>it but you know you try and like find<br>ways to to make it easy for you yeah<br>well I mean autism generally is<br>diagnosed basic on a list of deficits<br>whereas actually in reality it it has<br>challenges and it has problems and you<br>work with with the pros and manage the<br>challenges and and sometimes that means<br>that you do things a bit differently but<br>your son's brain works differently so<br>why would you not work with it and over<br>time we add things in different things<br>to end on taking<br>um the autistic person where they're at<br>and going with it and we're just always<br>learning we've really touched on the<br>idea of Journey a lot so I'd really like<br>to thank all of you for coming in and<br>having this Claudia to abroad today I do<br>really really appreciate your time and<br>your thoughts yeah thanks for having us<br>oh no worries</p></main><footer
