also know is<br>CSS the F<br>for um needed to be replaced because you<br>know it was probably 40 years uh 40<br>something years since they were um put<br>up so um you know there was decision<br>made by the marai people that we need to<br>um probably look at redoing them so yeah<br>that's the reason and you know 40 years<br>is pretty much uh standard time of uh<br>life before you need to have a good look<br>at them so um the replication of these<br>for you know we we had to utilize um<br>photography as the um method of uh<br>allowing us to sort of replicate cuz we<br>couldn't take the carvings down because<br>the FY needed to be you know in<br>operation for the many different um you<br>know uh t that happens on the M um cuz<br>usually we take the carvings off place<br>them next to us and then we carve<br>directly with them next to us and that<br>allows for easy sort of like you know<br>crossing over and just checking that<br>we're we're close um this experience was<br>um totally different we had to get a<br>drone to take shots you know um and then<br>within that drones movement then we<br>isolated images so that we could replace<br>them onto the you know to the carving<br>onto the wood this is the first time<br>I've done it in this manner um so it was<br>an experience um there was<br>um you know there was a lot of anxieties<br>around how close are we um how close are<br>we going to get into these carvings um<br>we did our best I think um people will<br>see oh Jing you know it's not too far<br>off um there's subtle differences<br>because you know these are um obviously<br>man-made things and they're not just<br>like a machine that to make them so it's<br>not going to be exact this is<br>stood here for 40 years 40 plus years<br>under the name of<br>T you can't change the narrative for<br>these types of mar or any marai you know<br>you need to try and keep it as close as<br>you can the whole sort of caring process<br>it's taken what took us about 9 months<br>um you know we gave ourselves that time<br>because we're also working with the um<br>time constraints of of the University<br>you know they needed the mor eyes open<br>for graduations and all stuff like that<br>so we had a time frame to work to and um<br>you know luckily enough I've got a good<br>team that can manage our workload within<br>the N9 months so we've done it and we<br>had you know installing it so it's great<br>with the relationship between<br>my9 and the<br>university the you know that we have<br>with them um I sort of you know<br>considered that and I I didn't see any<br>sort of relevant reflection of that in<br>the originals so the in style um in the<br>style just to reference you know the<br>manaen connection here and they on the<br>am which are the Y why of you know um so<br>for me it was<br>about um you know letting people know<br>that you know na fat was feet are firmly<br>placed in this funeral um as everyone<br>sort of knows you know um you know there<br>may there may be some um you know<br>resistance around it<br>but my intentions were not you know to<br>be disrespectful to anyone but just to<br>show that we are here yeah so that that<br>would probably be the only sort of um<br>difference it's the two um everything<br>else was replicated pretty much bang on<br>as close as we could get it I wasn't<br>here on the burial day but um I I seen<br>photos of you know the moments that was<br>happening and they were given a good bed<br>you know to rest just like we do with uh<br>Al two you know um and we we consider<br>them in that manner because you know<br>they are carvings about the old people<br>or the you know<br>the so we utilize that TI of proper<br>burial kak and then leave them yeah you<br>know when it comes to um the<br>installation a lot of it is about um<br>practicality you know the tong is based<br>on practicality<br>um usually we put the the PIP pie the am<br>then the Mahi and then the the C goes on<br>last you know it's just the head of the<br>building um so we we like to put that on<br>last um that's sort of like the master<br>master piece you know that's the when<br>you're sort of giving life to the fny uh<br>for installation generally you know you<br>know this is we're only working with the<br>front of the house so<br>that's seven pieces so that should take<br>you know<br>two to three days there's a there's a<br>couple of setup uh processes that we<br>have to do to to you know before we can<br>place them on the building and those<br>that takes a lot of thinking you know<br>and that's why we're getting the the um<br>the Carpenters cuz you know I'm not a<br>carpenter but but we we're around to<br>help them and because they they want us<br>to talk to them about how do we treat<br>the carving you how do we you know do we<br>stand there do we stand on it can we you<br>know so we we have to be there to guide<br>them and just you know this is still<br>a not a tuo but it still has a Modi and<br>you have to understand how that works<br>and and they do they're really good<br>these guys that we're working with you I<br>don't know about the timing but<br>currently they they're trying to put on<br>the one my here as soon as we get one up<br>the other one should be you know they<br>should have they have uh dealt with the<br>um bad experiences and then by the next<br>one we should be just boom boom bo<br>hopefully they should have everything<br>done today then we should be covering<br>them for the Hur um which is possibly up<br>or po yeah so usually we put them up<br>cover them and then wait for the<br>everyone<br>h<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
