How do river ecosystems do the work of converting sunlight and terrestrial leftovers into the rich diversity of aquatic animals that make up river food webs? How is the capacity of river ecosystems to support and sustain aquatic ecosystem structure and function being challenged in the modern era as a result of land use and global change? What can we do to protect, conserve, and restore river ecosystems in the face of these challenges?<br> <br>Emily S. Bernhardt is the James B. Duke Distinguished Professor in the Department of Biology at Duke University in North Carolina, USA. She is an ecosystem ecologist and biogeochemist who is fundamentally interested in exploring how global change is altering the movement of water, elements, and contaminants through ecosystems and the consequences for ecosystem structure and function. She is visiting the University of Waikato as a Fulbright specialist</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100%

uh today I have<br>the pleasure of welcoming Professor<br>Emily burnhard from Duke University to<br>give a talk so profess burnhard is the<br>James B Duke distinguished professor at<br>Duke University and she's part of the<br>Nicholas School of environment and she's<br>here<br>um as a forbite specialist so this is<br>basically a visit facilitated by the<br>forbite foundation um and with a<br>particular focus on working with<br>freshwater researchers and reviewing the<br>workshop report of<br>Theo Symposium that we held jointly with<br>W Regional Council and W River Authority<br>last year so before I start I would like<br>to ask my m co- director T Medico to<br>give us<br>presentation<br>for<br>for<br>place<br>right yeah thank you uh thanks so much<br>for having me I'm really excited to be<br>here for a couple weeks to learn a lot<br>about a river you don't often get the<br>chance to just come and really learn a<br>lot from both and I think there's going<br>to be all kinds of interesting things<br>for me to take back home with me um as I<br>learned about the Bon so I want to talk<br>about rivers today but I am going to be<br>here for a couple weeks so I did want to<br>say that I'm not talking today let's see<br>maybe I'm maybe I'm not doing anything<br>today yeah um I do work on other things<br>and if folks are interested in talking<br>to me about saltwater intrusion sea<br>level rise and Rural Coastal Landscapes<br>to do a lot of that work in North<br>Carolina um I teach a class on climate<br>change that's interdisciplinary together<br>with a theologian I'd love to chat with<br>folks about that um I've done a lot of<br>work on mountaintop removable coal<br>mining um and gold mining in Peru and so<br>if you want to talk about mining I'm<br>interested in that as well so just so<br>you know I don't just need to talk about<br>rivers um and I've also um in the midst<br>of a very large project to merge<br>catchment science records from all over<br>the world to allow population level<br>studies water shed SES but for today I<br>want to talk about rivers because that<br>they're my like natal scientific home<br>and I love them so much um this is a<br>picture of new Creek which is a stream<br>uh really close to Duke University and<br>actually the home of the very first ever<br>annual metabolism study done in a river<br>back in the late 1960s by Charlie Hall<br>I'll come back to<br>that I think you know rivers are amazing<br>systems that we rely on for so many<br>things you know they're an important uh<br>you know I think every kid loves Rivers<br>I know I'm probably a river scientist<br>because love playing revers as a kid and<br>pulling up crayfish and pulling up bugs<br>and being excited by them uh they're<br>sort of magical places and we rely on<br>them for ritual and economic activity um<br>and we also um are changing them rapidly<br>all over the<br>world I'm really interested in how<br>climate change is impacting rivers and<br>it's actually kind of hard to study on<br>top of all the other things that we're<br>doing to them so this is just to remind<br>me to say that we know that River and<br>stream temperatures are increasing uh<br>Global ocean temperature increases are<br>getting all the attention but of course<br>freshwaters are warming all over the<br>place<br>um this is a nice compilation of USGS<br>orus for the United States um we know<br>that uh the water cycle of the planet is<br>speeding up and so also river flows are<br>increasing while at the same time more<br>rivers are drying which is a confusing<br>thing to explain to the public right<br>we're getting higher highs and lower<br>lows um and these are sort of more<br>extreme conditions that make it hard to<br>make a living as an aquatic<br>organism these things can be really hard<br>to see in a lot of the rivers that I<br>work on because we're doing all these<br>other things that are even more obvious<br>and more extreme and more acute uh it<br>could be water quality pollution this is<br>the famous kayoga river in Ohio that was<br>actually went on fire for months because<br>of pollution back in the 60s uh storm<br>water pipes uh all kinds of Channel<br>erosion sediment pollution Livestock in<br>the Stream so these are the things that<br>we're typically sort of seeing the the<br>front edge right the most obvious edge<br>of what's happening to any river system<br>you might walk into but at the same time<br>they're also experiencing climate change<br>so I've been thinking a lot about how do<br>we study both of these things<br>simultaneously and I don't have an<br>answer for you but I'll tell you of the<br>things that I've been learning along the<br>way I should also say I have seen all<br>these slides before and this is a small<br>crowd so if you want to interrupt me and<br>we want to get into a conversation<br>that's totally fine I don't need to get<br>to the end okay so one of my basic<br>questions is thinking about the<br>energetics of rivers and I'm really<br>proud of this slide I was able to<br>publish this in knowledge and<br>oceanography without an without a y<br>AIS it's one of my favorite figures I've<br>ever made and what is it it's four years<br>of oxygen traces for four different<br>Rivers uh I love it because it tells<br>this super interesting story of Four<br>Rivers with really different stories<br>right you've got the monoman river in<br>Wisconsin there with this big strong<br>signal every summer it's incredibly<br>productive uh you've got this little<br>river in Fano Creek Oregon a super<br>shaded stream that's barely doing<br>anything and this is basically the<br>breath of a river right or I like to<br>think of it as the pulse of a river and<br>this was sort of early days of the<br>stream pulse project um that I was part<br>of with a whole cast of Amazing folks<br>across the United States and this is all<br>the piis but there were about 30 grad<br>students associated with this as well<br>over the course of a fiveyear project<br>and our goal was like can we take all<br>these oxygen traces and can we begin<br>collecting oxygen traces and make the<br>measurement to converting that kind of<br>data into energetic survivors something<br>that people commonly do as a part of our<br>work um okay so and why why do that why<br>think about energetic regimes well we<br>spent a lot of time thinking about how<br>rivers are altered in terms of their<br>sort of sort of their flow regimes their<br>thermal regimes um and much of what we<br>think about in terms of river<br>degradation is about those alterations<br>in the physical these physical processes<br>so if you thought about rivers at all<br>you've probably thought about the<br>natural flow regime uh St um St this is<br>from stban and Angela arthington huge<br>amount of work on how various um<br>manipulations of water infrastructure or<br>climate are altering the flow regimes of<br>rivers so flow regimes are really<br>important for studying life history of<br>organisms that live in rivers they<br>important for moving sediments for<br>actually creating the form and structure<br>of channels and as we put in dams or as<br>we put in levies or as we change the<br>climate we alter the timing of floods<br>and droughts and low and high flows and<br>ways that makes it actually quite<br>difficult for the organs that evolve in<br>those places to sustain their life cycle<br>so this is one of the major things that<br>we've altered about rivers over time and<br>then the natural thermal regime maybe<br>it's not gotten as much attention but<br>it's also equally important um as a sort<br>of phological cues for all kinds of BL<br>history in systems right there's lots of<br>cold water Fisheries for example we're<br>very concerned about as they warm it's<br>impossible for those Fisheries to be<br>sustained so the same kinds of cues and<br>sort of seasonal temperature regimes are<br>really important and we're manipulating<br>that just as much U by altering not only<br>the climate but altering the way water<br>is entering systems and how long water<br>is<br>stored so we wanted to take these ideas<br>together with light regimes receive a<br>lot less attention but is obviously a<br>really important driver of the<br>productivity of rivers and you think<br>about the fact that light uh in rivers<br>is is a function not just of how much<br>light is getting through the clouds but<br>also how much light is getting through<br>the canopy right and as we manipulate<br>riparian vegetation or manipulate River<br>widths we also change the light regimes<br>of the system so if you think about<br>these sort of primary drivers of how<br>Rivers work how the E what the ecosystem<br>sort of working constraints are it's<br>going to be the flow regime the thermal<br>regime and the light regime sort of set<br>the constraint space in which life has<br>to operate right so let's go back to<br>this sort of Life oper operating in four<br>different systems with obviously very<br>different thermal light and flow regimes<br>so we can take these oxygen traces and<br>of course they're super interesting to<br>look at but oxygen profiles and rivers<br>are a function of both the amount of<br>breathing by organisms right the<br>production of oxygen by<br>photosynthesizers the consumption of<br>oxygen by heterotrofos but also all<br>kinds of complicated physical Dynamics<br>oxygen being delivered by from<br>groundwater where oxygen being um uh<br>evaded to the atmosphere through<br>atmospheric exchange and it's<br>complicated to think about that<br>atmospheric exchange of rivers because<br>it's a result of turbulence and surface<br>area and all these things but the basic<br>unit of energetic measurements in rivers<br>is a single day of oxygen so think about<br>oxygen trace it typically G if you have<br>algae or macrofit in your system<br>Oxygen's going to get high in the middle<br>of the day at solar noon and it's going<br>to be very low at night when the hets<br>are active and the auto TRS are not so<br>this dial amplitude of oxygen can be<br>used to actually calculate the amount of<br>productivity and then estimate the<br>amount of ecosystem respiration and<br>evasion or gas exchange that are<br>occurring the<br>system we've known this for a really<br>long time in fact whole ecosystem<br>energetic measurements began in rivers<br>with the work of um Eugene Odo back in<br>the um late 50s and early days super<br>hard if you wanted to make an oxygen<br>Trace in a river from a single day you<br>had to go out with your gas type bottles<br>and you had to bring those bottles like<br>the lab you had to do Winkler titrations<br>and so creating a single day days<br>metabol metabolism estimate would<br>probably take you three days of work<br>back in the lab so this is from Charlie<br>Hall's um dissertation work back in the<br>late 60s uh published in ecology a<br>single day's metabolism estimate and the<br>idea is you get this dial signal and<br>then you use the sort of day night thing<br>just like a dark light bottle incubation<br>to estimate the whole ecosystem level<br>productivity but extremely difficult to<br>do and quite expensive and so for very<br>long time uh this was only done for a<br>day at a time and usually on nice days<br>when you wanted to be in the field<br>right so uh the very first estimates<br>were made by Eugene Odum in the Florida<br>Springs uh and then Charlie Hall um<br>started doing some work um with Howard<br>odm is his dissertation advisor he made<br>measurements using those Winkler<br>titrations multiple times per year he<br>was the first person to get an actual<br>seasonal pattern of metabolism for River<br>this is new Creek in North Carolina and<br>it's kind of cool I think the coolest<br>thing about it we walk you through it on<br>the bottom we've got months of the year<br>the the white shaded area is the<br>productivity and up above that you've<br>got the ecosystem respiration so one<br>thing you can see is that respiration of<br>the system is always higher than<br>productivity and that's because the<br>river is receiving lots of organic<br>carbon from the surrounding um<br>terrestrial environment that's sub<br>that's subsidizing uh the energetics of<br>best system you can see that the peak of<br>productivity in this river is in March<br>and that's really interesting and<br>actually now we know quite common in<br>deciduous forested rivers that are<br>narrow because during the summer it's<br>actually too shaded for much<br>productivity to occur so you get this<br>like little narrow window the water<br>warms up enough and it's bright enough<br>that you get productivity and as soon as<br>the canopy closes you shut that down you<br>get a second peak of high respiration in<br>the fall and that's not surprising<br>that's because you're getting a huge<br>subsidy of Autumn litterfall it's coming<br>in so this was a really beautiful study<br>of the actual ecosystem phology of a<br>river done in<br>1969 and then not again for 30<br>years um instead people didn't want to<br>do wlow titration pain in the ass sorry<br>right um so they waited till we had<br>sensors and initial sensors right were<br>super expensive the very first oxygen<br>sensors were going to be about 20<br>$25,000 and so you're going to put that<br>out in a stream only on a nice day when<br>there's not going to be a storm right<br>and you're not going to leave it out<br>there very long so people would<br>typically go out and leave their oxygen<br>sensors or sit out with their oxygen<br>sensors right for a couple days and they<br>make measurements and people started to<br>say we're going to do this all over the<br>place we're goingon to do large scale uh<br>measurements and one of the biggest<br>studies to do that um was from the the<br>loic intersight nitrogen experiment in<br>the United States which went across 72<br>different rivers and measured metabolism<br>and used in5 labeled ammonium to measure<br>nitrogen uptake super cool study but the<br>metabolism data that they got in all<br>these different biomes do you see any<br>patterns here no nothing like the biomes<br>aren't different from each other there's<br>just this scattered shot each of these<br>points is basically two days<br>of right and actually when I just showed<br>you that variability seasonally right or<br>those oxygen TR there's just so much<br>day-to-day variability in a river that<br>when you take a single day or two days<br>you have no idea does that represent the<br>mean does that represent the max that<br>represent menu really don't know because<br>we just don't have enough information we<br>have a single seasonal study in the<br>world to go so we had this sort of large<br>scale but shortterm measurement<br>frequency and then we started to see a<br>couple more people starting to do these<br>near continuous measurements as sensors<br>got<br>cheaper um the first two studies that o<br>oer and Switzerland and then Brian<br>Roberts and Pat mahand in in bdge<br>National Lab in in Tennessee um started<br>to do these beautiful um annual<br>metabolisms so the Roberts and all one<br>looks a lot like the new Creek one<br>you've got here again months of the year<br>you got that spring algo Peak you got<br>nothing happening during the summer and<br>then you get this big Autumn litterfall<br>peak of respiration not accompanied by<br>Al productivity very cool deciduous<br>forest system W berlinger's plot is from<br>a river system Downstream of a dam with<br>m hydropower releases and so that system<br>is super bright it's a big open river<br>that gets massive planned floods and you<br>get exactly what you might expect under<br>those conditions right so every time<br>there's a big bed scouring flood you<br>knock that productivity back it recovers<br>you knock it back it recovers so these<br>show us the importance of both light and<br>flow regimes in driving the pattern of<br>productivity in members and and super<br>interesting and obviously two very<br>different systems so now we've got three<br>annual metabolis measures for the entire<br>entirety of rivers of the world so the<br>goal of the stam pulse project was to<br>try to put something in this quadrant of<br>the graph and say well can we actually<br>start doing annual continuous metabolism<br>records all over the world um and use<br>that to actually understand what drives<br>variability Andross<br>systems so as again coming back to this<br>idea these are dissolved oxygen<br>concentrations and I just want to point<br>out that in this Trace you could pick a<br>day in each of these four rivers where<br>their oxy dial C exactly the same right<br>but these are not the same river<br>right and so we have we have and then we<br>can take those same uh combination of<br>rivers here now I'm picking sort of<br>three different days for each of those<br>rivers and you can see on their best day<br>and on their worst day their worst days<br>are all the same nothing's happening<br>right on their best days they're quite<br>different and the frequency of those<br>best days and worst days is quite<br>systems and you can see how important so<br>now I've converted those oxygen traces<br>into actual ual estimates of daily<br>metabolism for each of these it's for a<br>60-day window and what you can see in<br>each case is the in the gray You' got<br>the hydrograph in the background so you<br>can see that in each case you've got<br>Peak flows that are knocking back your<br>productivity right and so that thermal<br>that um that flow regime is going to<br>beig Big constraint but we can Happ it<br>across system so we started off um our<br>project with sort of these ideas from<br>these long-term auction records<br>available from the USGS there few<br>examples and saying we think light and<br>flow are the big um the big drivers<br>so we can we can as we start to do this<br>we can add in a much more um I think<br>robust way what is the role of rivers in<br>global carbon cycling something people<br>have been interested in for a long time<br>um and instead of having just point<br>estimates we can actually take lots and<br>lots of individual traces and I'm just<br>going to show you a couple different so<br>we first we we basically did this for<br>215 different Us Rivers which had at<br>least a year of data um I will say now<br>that data is that data is all published<br>if you want to play with it and we're<br>just about to publish a new one that's<br>got at least uh eight to 14 years of<br>data from over um 50 rivers in the US so<br>you can actually look at long-term<br>trends or year-to-year variability so<br>from those 25 Us Rivers we can now make<br>an estimate of the average productivity<br>of rivers I realize 215 US river<br>segments is not that many but it's a<br>whole lot more than three right and so<br>we can can begin to have annual<br>estimates not sort of Point estimates<br>which we're extrapolating to a whole<br>year and we can start to put those<br>numbers um into Global budgets I think<br>those numbers will probably continue to<br>improve but probably not a lot um my one<br>of my former mentors Bill linger who um<br>has done a lot of global carbon cycling<br>work loves we taught a class together I<br>love to point out that the original<br>estimates of global thresold<br>productivity by lethan Whitaker in the<br>late 50s are within a half a teragram of<br>the modern satellite based estimates and<br>those are based on like 50 weather<br>stations around the world on a bunch of<br>biomass removal things so I think we're<br>going to see we'll probably refine it<br>we'll probably understand more about the<br>heterogeneity but I suspect the numbers<br>are not going to change a lot rivers are<br>not uh major they're not producing tons<br>of carbon in the system and there are<br>net hter traic that'll be kind of our<br>our outcome but we can begin to think<br>about how's that changing where is it<br>changing a lot and I think the much more<br>interesting questions are do rivers have<br>characteristic metabolic regimes and how<br>are they changing and how does that<br>think about the role of river energetics<br>in sustaining the biodiversity and<br>ecosystem processes that are critical to<br>why we want to protect rivers in the<br>first place so I find the carbon cycling<br>thing I mean useful but kind of boring<br>honestly what's much more interesting is<br>what's happening uh to river systems as<br>they're being altered or as we're trying<br>to manage and restore them can we bring<br>energetic regimes back into this into<br>some semblance of what organisms that<br>evolve there that we're trying to<br>protect um are used to so do rivers have<br>characteristic metabolic regime so we<br>started doing this uh postto Phil boy<br>was a lead postto on our stream pulse<br>project um and he started to do a bunch<br>of really cool uh Dynamic time series<br>modeling um to try and actually do sort<br>of clustering analysis of What kinds of<br>variability are we getting any sort of<br>annual patterns so can we start to<br>describe big patterns and the first<br>effort of that was for a subset of those<br>25 Rivers for which we had multiple<br>years of data so we could look at you<br>know annual average patterns and we<br>begin to see that the biggest divides<br>were first canopy shading those rivers<br>on the top this is the actual<br>productivity and this is the normalized<br>you can see the patterns a little bit<br>better but basically if your canop if<br>you have a shaded canopy um you don't<br>nothing much happens right and if you<br>don't have canop be shading then you can<br>have higher productivity and then second<br>split in each case is hydrologic<br>disturbance so when you're flashy you<br>have frequent High flows number three<br>and number two here not much happens<br>right so you're basically uh constrained<br>by light or limited by light and<br>constrained by flow as the sort of major<br>categories of differentiation between<br>regimes so we published this paper um<br>year before last from u in PN from sort<br>of the big outcome of of seven years of<br>study so this is for hundreds of of Us<br>Rivers for which we had annual<br>metabolism patterns and that same idea<br>that came out in the first couple years<br>of our work has been borne out U it's<br>complicated figure but if I can walk you<br>through we basically took um the entire<br>data set over 300 rivers and we looked<br>at the quartile so if you look at the<br>quartile with the highest light that's<br>up in the top left we look at the<br>quartile with the most flow variability<br>here in the bottom right you look at the<br>CW with the most stable flows and the CW<br>with the lowest light and already you<br>can see big differences right like light<br>matters and flow matters right so you're<br>going to get your highest productivity<br>in the intersection between highl and<br>stable flows we call these bright and<br>stable systems doesn't it sound nice and<br>then you're going to be really you're<br>gonna not you're gble to do very much in<br>a dark and unstable system which has all<br>kinds of connotations but that makes<br>sense to you right the dark and unstable<br>system is not going to have a lot of<br>productivity so we can begin to imagine<br>that these are the big constraints the<br>big drivers interesting here I know that<br>here here in wado and almost everywhere<br>else in the world we're thinking a lot<br>about nutrient enrichment there's not<br>there's not great data on nutrients from<br>this data set but where we have it it<br>seems like nutrients are going to be a<br>much more secondary or tertiary control<br>and instead what I think we're going to<br>see is that these productivity regimes<br>the respiration regimes are big drivers<br>of the nutrient concentration so a<br>system like this has is doing very<br>little work it can't act on the<br>nutrients that are being loaded to it a<br>system like the one on the top can<br>absolutely act on that nutrient so I<br>think it's going to be more the reverse<br>that the energetic regimes are drivers<br>of the nutrient regimes as opposed to<br>the reverse but of course the more<br>nutrients you add you might imagine Your<br>Capacity take advantage of light goes up<br>so it might amplify but not be the prim<br>strainer that's that's my hypothesis I<br>would say we don't have data to prove<br>that yet but everything that I've seen<br>so far is consistent with that idea so I<br>think these energetic regimes are going<br>to be important for thinking about how<br>we manage uh R River nutrient loads once<br>the nutrients are already in the<br>river any questions about that I see<br>nodding no nobody looks too mad about<br>that idea okay so then the big question<br>is how River metabolic regimes changing<br>we now have data to say okay we can put<br>up these archetypes we can imagine the<br>kinds of regimes that most rivers are<br>going likely going to fall into can we<br>change them can we use this either<br>understand Rivers CH changing or River<br>Management um this was one of the great<br>examples we used in our our first paper<br>from the project um this is from the M<br>of Spain uh and I think there was 16<br>years of data eight before and eight<br>after after a Wastewater shooting plant<br>went in uh and the black so this is a<br>cernal density plot and it basically<br>shows for eight years mainly estim of ER<br>and gppp and it just made a contour plot<br>right so the whole all almost all the<br>data fit inside that 75th cor top so<br>those black lines show you where the<br>data points sit for um before the waste<br>treat plan went in you can see it had<br>super high rates of ecosystem<br>respiration um and then once the was Str<br>plant went in the green lines that<br>compressed up to near the origin so this<br>might be kind of surprising to you get<br>to this nutrient thing as well we tend<br>to think about waste or Tre plants<br>putting lots of nitrogen and phosphor to<br>the system they also put in a lot of<br>organic carbon really labout carbon and<br>so here the big effect of the was or<br>plant going in is that we've reduced the<br>amount of labal carbon that's coming in<br>and we're seeing far less respiration<br>not really much change in productivity<br>at all um in the system which is pretty<br>interesting but the other thing I'll say<br>is this fingerprint this metabolic<br>fingerprint as we call it is an<br>excellent diagnosis of the fact that you<br>have actually created a major change as<br>a result of an intervention and what<br>kinds of uh um solutes are coming in the<br>system so I'll show you another example<br>this is from my pH former PhD student J<br>blastek now a faculty member Reno we<br>were working in urban systems um in<br>North Carolina thinking about water that<br>had similar amounts of impervious cover<br>but really different Road densities so<br>here is like the Watershed<br>characteristics were quite similar all<br>we're about 10% impervious cover but<br>they had really different uh Road and<br>pipe densities and those Road and pipe<br>densities led to very different flashing<br>as signatures for the stream hydrographs<br>so I'll just show you for these six<br>sites for which we had continuous<br>metabolism um we had F1 our least flashy<br>F6 are most flashy we don't have a<br>seasonal precipitation regime in North<br>Carolina it just kind of rains all the<br>time and whether or not you get floods<br>is a lot to do with pavement so our<br>flasia system had a basically a bed<br>scouring flood roughly every seven days<br>that's a lot right um and then if and so<br>this is the Richard Baker's flash index<br>you can see that even though all these<br>watersheds had really similar total<br>impervious cover the way it was<br>configured and the way it was connected<br>the streams quite different so what<br>Joanna did was then we measured daily<br>productivity across uh several<br>years and um we she she looked at this<br>in in I think a way that's kind of<br>interesting when you thinking about um<br>the effect of instead of just looking<br>just at rates she looked at the the<br>ability of the ecosystem to convert<br>light into productivity right because<br>light regimes can be quite different<br>between the systems so if you take how<br>much light is the system getting getting<br>and how much is it able to convert into<br>productivity and that's what this shows<br>so the top three are least flashy<br>systems the bottom three are most<br>flashing systems the x- axis is showing<br>the amount of light reaching the channel<br>surface and then the y- axis is the<br>daily rates of productivity and what you<br>can see is that are really flashy<br>systems it doesn't really matter how<br>much light you're getting you're not<br>creating almost any productivity from<br>this systems whereas in our less flashy<br>systems um you're going to actually see<br>a response to flight so this suggests<br>the major constraint of flow<br>disturbances that basically keep<br>knocking biomass back either through<br>scour or through burial so that you<br>can't actually have the system taking<br>advantage of<br>light so again just a I think a really<br>Vivid example of how hydrologic<br>disturbance can be a primary constraint<br>so you're gon to reach a point at which<br>the bed is moving too much for the<br>system to really do any any biological<br>work<br>okay so now I'm going to take you to<br>what I think is my our best climate<br>change story today and it's really<br>limited because as I said there's one<br>annual metabolism pattern in the whole<br>world before<br>1990 um and so we went back to that same<br>system but of course It suffers from<br>anywhere we have like two data points<br>right one in 1969 and one in 2019 so<br>this is again we're back to Charlie<br>Hall's figure from New Hope Creek um<br>it's a great fish paper for fish people<br>if you've never met it's really awesome<br>I'm not talk about that today was really<br>cool um and my student Alice Carter went<br>out and repeated the anal metabolism for<br>the same string in the same locations um<br>I'm showing you here what's happened to<br>the climate in the system over the<br>intervening uh 50<br>years so in<br>1969 uh air temperatures were a good<br>four degrees cooler have gone up about<br>04 degrees C per decade uh and then this<br>is water temperature which I think is<br>really remarkable 2019 in Black U red is<br>1969 we can see in 1969 The Hope Creek<br>froze during the winter it had ice in<br>the winter time when Alice was doing it<br>it it never dropped below five degrees<br>and most of the time was about 10<br>degrees hotter during the winter this is<br>a um almost fully forested Watershed<br>mostly protected inside of the Duke<br>experimental research Forest so very<br>little land use change this is almost<br>exclusively climate change so much<br>warmer temperatures you see that<br>throughout the year but particularly<br>dramatic in the winter time if you think<br>about how important leaves are to fuel<br>the system you can kind of imagine what<br>this means in terms of energetics of<br>winter time I'm forecasting a little bit<br>the other thing that's happened is we'<br>had change in flows um so this just<br>shows anal precipitation there's not<br>been really any change but the number of<br>extreme events has gone up that middle<br>graph and the number of days with no<br>precipitation has gone up so we've got<br>higher highs and lower lows that have<br>been happening in hydrographic over time<br>and so if we compare those two years uh<br>the biggest things to see are those Peak<br>storm events are higher in the 2019 than<br>anything that was measured in Charlie<br>Hall's day and I think that's consistent<br>with what the sort long-term record<br>suggests other thing is if you look at<br>late October uh we went to a no flow<br>period during that time and not much<br>evidence that that was happening very<br>regularly back in the<br>60s so now we can compare um what the uh<br>estimates of Charlie Hall back in 1969<br>look like versus the estimates that um<br>2019 and what's happened is that the<br>system has become both more productive<br>and more heterotrophic um so the 2019 is<br>in Gray and 1969 is in red and we've<br>seen an increase in both um massive I<br>think one of the most interesting thing<br>is that if you look in Gray here the<br>gray um 2019 versus the red 1969 what<br>you're seeing is like really high High<br>respiration throughout the entire winter<br>whereas it's mostly shut down in 1969<br>and I think that makes sense it's 10<br>it's five to 10 degrees hotter for<br>months in the winter than it was before<br>you've just added a huge amount of leaf<br>litter so you've allowed the system sort<br>of chew through that leaf litter for<br>many more months than it would have in<br>the past I think that's quite<br>interesting if you think about the life<br>cycle of organisms that are tied to Leaf<br>litter as the primary energy<br>source also the dominant metabolic<br>window is shifted from the spring to the<br>fall or even the winter result in a net<br>shift towards heterotrophy so you've got<br>it's more productive but the<br>heterotropic increases even more so it's<br>even more heterotropic than it in the<br>past I think so I think what's<br>interesting here is you've got a shift<br>in timing you've got a shift in<br>magnitude uh and you've got a shift in<br>the net carbon dynamics of the system<br>now I'll be careful to say of course<br>these are two data points but they<br>literally are the only two data points<br>we have where you can compare things<br>that are more than 10 years apart um and<br>it is at least consistent with what<br>you'd expect from first principles that<br>a warming winter stream is going to have<br>have a really different um Dynamics than<br>than its cooler<br>counterpart so my student Johnny baren<br>is finishing up this spring um sort of<br>piggyback on top of this and wanted to<br>compare the Dynamics of new Creek um<br>metabolism which we just showing you to<br>the Dynamics of the adjacent El Creek<br>Watershed which drains most of the city<br>of Durham which is where Duke University<br>is um it's about 70% um developed versus<br>n Creek being less than 5% developed and<br>so he went out measured metabolism<br>continuously uh en forced the new creek<br>site it's going to look the same it's<br>just that it starts a little bit at<br>different times so you've got your<br>spring Peak uh and not much going on the<br>rest of the year uh this is the El Creek<br>at the point where the water are exactly<br>the same size but a waste water sugar<br>plant is coming in so heavily subsidized<br>uh by nutrients and organic matter and<br>you can see that this system looks a lot<br>more like Oiler side of the Switzerland<br>right it's flashy and enriched and it's<br>getting the sort of Boom bust activity<br>dynamics that you might expect even<br>though the amount of light and the<br>amount of organic matter coming into the<br>system are uh the amount of leaf coming<br>into the system are almost exactly the<br>same the storm water site is about<br>halfway up the urban water shed it<br>doesn't have a waste water coming in and<br>it's extremely flashy so the bed is<br>moving roughly every seven days and<br>almost nothing is happening there but it<br>doesn't have a spring Peak right it's<br>just sort of like if you have a couple<br>if you have a couple weeks without high<br>flows you get<br>productivity what's cool about what<br>Johnny's been doing is that he was<br>measuring metalism but his actual<br>questions were about the production of<br>bugs in the system or secondary<br>production so once a month um for a<br>whole year he went out and looked at Bic<br>biomass did all the measurements to be<br>able to do biomass production in these<br>systems I'll remind you sorry that the<br>Wastewater system is about twice as<br>productive as the forested counterpart<br>you might expect that subsidy of organic<br>matter and nutrients and productivity<br>might lead to higher bug production but<br>in fact it does not so here are the the<br>forest side up on the top the Wastewater<br>site in the middle and the storm water<br>site on the bottom and what's actually<br>really interesting is the Wastewater and<br>Stor water both Urban streams are<br>producing very little secondary<br>production at all and it's not very<br>diverse it's almost entirely U corid<br>midges and a really tolerant hydros ctis<br>flies whereas the forest streams<br>producing predominantly philam ctis<br>flies lots of grazing May flies uh<br>completely different sorts of Dynamics<br>right and a really different um<br>really different identity of what's<br>coming out I think there's 22 families<br>coming out in the forested site and less<br>than seven in the Two Urban sites so<br>massive differences in diversity massive<br>differences in timing of emergence uh<br>total differences in second production<br>I'll put that into a simpler sort of<br>annualized<br>graph green is the estimate of total<br>annual production and brown is the total<br>net metabolism the total heterotropic<br>productivity the orange bars show you<br>the amount of secondary production per<br>meter squar per year and what we see is<br>that you although you have almost twice<br>as much production in the Wastewater<br>site as the forested site you get you<br>get half of the secondary production so<br>the efficiency with which you can<br>convert that basil metabolic energy is<br>really um constrained in these Urban<br>sites which is which is pretty<br>fasinating right so it doesn't matter<br>how much you produce if you can if it's<br>constantly interrupted now that could be<br>because the productivity is interrupted<br>it could be because the productivity is<br>at a less palatable Al format I don't I<br>don't know the answer to that uh or it<br>could be that you're actually just<br>constantly washing any attempted uh you<br>know larva that has a long life cycle<br>that just can't stay in the system all<br>these things could be true but we expect<br>that energetic regime is a part of the<br>story uh for the reduction<br>biomass so all this is coming together<br>into this idea that I really like to see<br>us adding an energetic component to how<br>we think about uh changes in River<br>ecosystems and the support of food webs<br>and biodiversity so we've long thought<br>about flow and light heat with physical<br>regimes and how they individually Drive<br>the ability of sensitive taxa to persist<br>but I think each of those physical<br>drivers also has an energetic<br>consequence right or an energetic echo<br>of those things which itself has Direct<br>effects on um the basically the<br>magnitude of production that could even<br>be possible the constraints on the food<br>web as well as the timing so I think if<br>we add metabolic regimes to these<br>physical regimes we're likely to learn a<br>lot more about what is going to drive<br>the ability of a river to support<br>consumers we've been trying to put this<br>into sort of a theoretical context um<br>and instead of just thinking about a<br>reach thinking about the at Network<br>scale so I'm going to take you into some<br>um theoretical modeling work that I've<br>been doing with hrio verzo who is a<br>phenomenal um River Network ecosystem<br>modeler um from the University of Venice<br>with we've been taking data we've<br>gathered from the stream pulse project<br>to to do sort of realistic estimates of<br>productivity hydrologic impacts um real<br>data from modus for litter inputs and<br>building a a model that sort of says<br>okay we should be able to estimate for<br>any segment give me how much light there<br>is how much bed scour there is and how<br>much Leaf litter is provided what amount<br>is available to feed razors collectors<br>and shreders and so we've actually<br>connected an ecosystem energetic model<br>to a food web<br>model<br>in this um modeling exercise and then<br>we're we're playing with climate change<br>so in this modeling exercise we estimate<br>the amount of light that's hitting every<br>node in a in a hypothetical River<br>Network and it's really simple like<br>smaller streams get less light bigger<br>streams gets more light and we estimate<br>litterfall this is based on using sort<br>of modus data so again narrower streams<br>get a higher litterfall input and wider<br>streams get a lower litterfall input the<br>important thing is that this is the same<br>in all of the scenarios and we use four<br>different scenarios where we actually<br>manipulated um the hydrograph and<br>temperature so we either made the system<br>significantly flashier Amplified the<br>Amplified the highs lowered lows and<br>then we increased the temperature by six<br>degrees C median temperature so and then<br>we did that the cross so we've got a Bas<br>scenario got a flash year scenario we<br>got a warmer scenario and we got a<br>hotter and flashier scenario and then we<br>can actually estimate for every single<br>one of those segments what's happening<br>and then each segment is hydrologically<br>connected to all Downstream segments so<br>you have basically the capacity for<br>things to happen in the reach or for<br>materials to be transported Downstream<br>or for organisms to be transported<br>Downstream and so now we can take what<br>we think we're beginning to understand<br>about a segment scale ecosystem and<br>convert that into a network scale<br>story so I'm going to show a couple<br>graphs like this um first this is<br>showing you like for going from<br>Headwaters down to the main stem where<br>is course particular organic matter<br>where is fine particular organic matter<br>where is algae for for scenarios um the<br>two solid lines are the flashier<br>scenarios red is always hotter and the<br>small um black line is the reference<br>conditions the biggest story here is<br>that when you have flashier systems<br>stuff gets pushed down stream right so<br>of course particular organic matter leav<br>Fall In The Stream but if it's a flash<br>to your system they don't stay so they<br>tend to get pushed Downstream the same<br>thing is true for find particular<br>organic matter you're moving materials<br>but they're being moved Downstream uh<br>and then for algae I think one of the<br>biggest stories is that if you have bed<br>mov flows um you're going to push a lot<br>of the productive systems to being<br>unproductive and your highest<br>productivity is going to occur<br>Downstream so we have a massive<br>reduction and total productivity as a<br>result of flashier<br>flows we can then take that and take the<br>consumers of those three resources and<br>find that if and they basically look<br>exactly like what's happening to seom so<br>if you move the leaflet or the big<br>organic matter Downstream the shredders<br>also have to move downstreams or the<br>stone flies and and ctis FES if you move<br>the bices downstream you also move the<br>collector gathers your blackfly larva<br>your net spinning ctis FES um and if you<br>move algae stream your grazers also are<br>going to be reduced on the top there you<br>can see the biomass and so you can see<br>that both warming and flashiness reduce<br>the total amount of Shredder collector<br>or Grazer biomass that can be produced<br>at the network scale and pretty<br>significantly in each<br>case and so we can look then at the<br>network scale this is a map now primary<br>consed productivity all three groups<br>from the Basel situation the womaning<br>situation The Flash year situation and<br>the W flash year and then that's<br>converted into numbers and if you look<br>at the the right hand side of this is<br>the whole network scale estimates so<br>what we're estimating from this model<br>using sort of first principles and real<br>data parameterized real parameter data<br>coming from our research we're seeing an<br>almost 70% reduction in the total amount<br>of biomass B produced in the network SC<br>scale in the warmer last year scenario<br>now we're never going to be able to<br>measure this in the real world because<br>we're never going to go to a whole<br>network where nothing is happening but<br>climate change right so we're going to<br>see these same Trends what that what<br>this theoretical modeling suggests is<br>that climate change is likely going to<br>be exacerbating any patterns that we are<br>seeing that are resulting from sediment<br>pollution or hypoxia right or flashy<br>flows due to storm Waters the other<br>thing I would say is it is going to make<br>it harder to mitigate or restore because<br>this underlying chronic change is<br>changing the rule set even as we're<br>trying to sort of remove some of those<br>primary<br>drivers so my suggestion and of course<br>this is theoretical but I think it makes<br>a ton of sense if you begin to think<br>about it it it really follows from first<br>principles but this may be a really<br>important driver of the dramatic<br>declines in um Aquatic and vertebrate<br>richness and density that we see this is<br>a paper that came out just last year<br>from a working group I was a part of<br>Samantha rlog was the lead author was an<br>amazing compilation of thousands and<br>thousands of long-term aquatic Inver<br>vertebrae data sets from across the US<br>showing really sharp declines in density<br>richness increase is really interesting<br>but as I was saying to Samantha the<br>title which science advances would let<br>her use it's a worm warmer world most of<br>the richness was in worms um all kinds<br>of coronis in Dipa and not not sensitive<br>taxes so we see the sensitive tax<br>Origins um declining and a lot of really<br>tolerant orms<br>increasing so over the past 47 years<br>streams across the United States have<br>seen a decreases in the total density of<br>backr verance everywhere and urban and<br>agricultural streams have lost the very<br>few disturbance sensitive taxes they<br>once have and have gained disturbance<br>tolerant taxes so this sort of land use<br>change together with climate change are<br>likely a part of the story and they're<br>both going to be really important to the<br>declines that we see over<br>time okay so I guess the main takeaways<br>that I have from today's talk is that<br>it's it's not possible to measure annual<br>metabolism consistently across many<br>rivers and I hope I've made a case to<br>you it's totally worth doing um because<br>it gives us a new set of constraints it<br>tells us a lot about what the river's<br>you know biomass is doing um and the<br>capacity of the system to produce animal<br>biomass and to actually affect nutrient<br>regimes there are characteristic<br>metabolic regimes in rivers and I think<br>that's quite useful you think about what<br>you should be seeing based on the light<br>and hydrologic regime that a system is<br>um um subjected to and climate change<br>landage change and pollution are all<br>altering these metabolic regimes in ways<br>that I think we are beginning to<br>understand uh and ways that we might<br>actually begin to use the energetic reg<br>regime to see if in fact we're able to<br>reverse some of those Trends I would say<br>at this point the consequences of freshw<br>biodiversity are unknown but I think we<br>have good uh theoretical and empirical<br>data to suggest that they're going to be<br>quite<br>important and so the big question that I<br>have and something I hope to be working<br>on for the next couple of decades is how<br>do we incorporate our emerging<br>understanding of the energetic regimes<br>of rivers into our management monitoring<br>freshwater resources and the last thing<br>I'll say is one of the big things we've<br>done with the strain pulse project is to<br>try to make a community data platform<br>where we help people turn sensor data<br>into metabolic messies uh we help people<br>clean up their messy sensor data and all<br>of our data is really available on the<br>web for anybody to play with the news<br>and so there's a gorgeous data visual<br>visualization platform that austr<br>encourage you to to check out um it's<br>been awesome that we did this with nine<br>nine initial pis funded to collect do<br>data and I think the stream poll site<br>now includes data from more than 150 uh<br>contributors so a lot of people if you<br>give them the tools to make it easier to<br>clean your data will be happy to share<br>their data this is kind of a a fun um<br>outcome on the data sharing front so<br>thank you very much for your attention<br>and I really look forward to questions<br>today or conversations uh during my<br>we have any questions in the<br>room feel free to raise your hand um<br>questions on Zoom please raise your hand<br>as<br>well um Frank ver sorry your call okay a<br>answer<br>Miss um I appreciate your comments about<br>like relating uh metabolism drivers's<br>metabolism to like the white region and<br>nutrient pollution being a major issue<br>here and I one of the other things that<br>I've just kind of noticed driving around<br>the landscape is they're extremely<br>turbid as well and I was just wondering<br>if your group has thought about not only<br>like a light that might reach the<br>surface of the stream but the effect on<br>um turbidity and L availability<br>turbidity is you wish you had more data<br>on it right so we we have great models<br>for we've created models to estimate<br>from satellite data and modus based um<br>canopy data we can actually estimate<br>light to any stream segment m in the<br>world but only the surface right so the<br>turbidity part obvious is a huge thing<br>and if you've got a turbid system you<br>won't see any productivity even if<br>there's plenty of light hit in the<br>system and that's one reason we started<br>looking at light use efficiency so<br>rather than looking at productivity<br>alone we say well how much productivity<br>is being produced per unit light turbo<br>drivers are going to have a really low<br>or no light use efficiency and that's<br>one way to get around that problem but<br>yeah huge huge constraint on data<br>availability<br>thanks yeah the modeling is really cool<br>um I was wondering um do you what sort<br>of scenarios we using for the the<br>changing environment flash year systems<br>because I'm wondering you know it's like<br>a shifting Baseline basically if you're<br>thinking about restoration you're trying<br>to get a system to return to you're<br>trying to rehabilitate basically to a<br>desired state but you know climate<br>change is happening and it's just<br>shifting the goal posts further and<br>further so you know we might be looking<br>back at time and saying it's not<br>returning back for that state that's<br>because the goal post is Shifting but I<br>was wondering you know what sort of rate<br>of change might you know be expected you<br>know the go post are moving but how<br>quickly are they moving so and maybe<br>that was something you considered in<br>your models like what scenarios would<br>constitute a warmer flesh you will um I<br>mean that's a great question I to I<br>totally don't know the answer to this<br>important it's important conversations<br>to be having right like the Baseline is<br>moving in ways that we don't fully<br>understand but if we're trying to go<br>back to a situation um that we've<br>arbitrarily picked 1975 right that's<br>what we want to go back to but mean in<br>the mean time the winter temperatures<br>have gone up by 10 degrees we're<br>probably not going to get there right<br>and so you that's an interesting one<br>like maybe then we focus on the<br>mechanism so the big change is that the<br>system the resid this time of organic<br>matter inputs is lower because you've<br>got this engine so do we create ways to<br>retain more of that right can we you<br>know you can imagine we can play with<br>physical and um and chemical shifts in a<br>way that might counter the mechanistic<br>change I'm I mean I've done a ton of<br>work on Restoration in my in my um in my<br>25 years of my career and most of the<br>time it's it's really hard to go back in<br>any way um and we're picking an<br>arbitrary deadline I would love to see<br>us instead saying what are we trying to<br>design for right so if we're really<br>concerned that the the system is is just<br>not supporting as many animals well why<br>is that right could we focus on the<br>energetic regime instead we think about<br>ways we could um increase the amount of<br>storage of organic matter or increase<br>the resilience of algae right in a<br>system where you're trying to do that so<br>I think that you know getting into the<br>mechanism as opposed to the physical<br>structure um is probably one one good<br>way to go but most importantly these are<br>conversations we should be having right<br>yeah<br>great are there any more questions any<br>questions on Zoom feel free to just um<br>questions no one has any questions no I<br>did have a question so this is f with<br>this question so do you think that toity<br>is then what drives the the relatively<br>the fact that there are very few river<br>systems that has low light availability<br>and stable flow what's the what's do you<br>think is driving that very few there<br>very few systems that USGS or<br>researchers work on that have high FL<br>that could be a sampling bias it's<br>probably sampling bias right and I don't<br>know how much yeah I don't know how many<br>um have focused on sidity there<br>certainly are I mean I know in our data<br>set from USGS there's a number of<br>Southern turban Rivers um and you can<br>sometimes see like the productivity<br>regime you got a flood event and then a<br>long time before it recovers and I think<br>often that's in systems where you get a<br>lot of turb like a lot of sediment um<br>movement but some systems we just know<br>they're black water or they're turban<br>and they're kind of off the charts and I<br>think it's like akin to when we think<br>about Lakes Lakes C you know<br>oligotrophic utopic and then dist Tropic<br>it's almost like we need this other<br>category of river systems where it's the<br>the turbidity or the colored organic<br>matter that a big constraint what can<br>happen yeah great I think we have<br>something coming through oh I'm here<br>6 so um thanks that was a really<br>interesting talk I should say I'm not a<br>fresh water<br>stream um I do a PE with food webs and I<br>guess I was just kind of noticing an<br>interesting Trend with I think was it<br>the Hope stream data from and in the<br>more recent dat from 2019 looks like<br>there's this sort of shift toward kind<br>of Browning of these food webs if you<br>have you know relatively similar<br>productivity levels but massive<br>increases in in<br>respiration and that's kind of what<br>you'd expect right warming might<br>actually enhance the microbial um<br>respiration at the expense of animal<br>biomass production do you think or<br>inefficiencies right trophic<br>inefficiencies is another one I'm really<br>interested in right so I guess like in<br>some way there's a bit potential that<br>that could actually be stabilizing food<br>webs in those systems if it's you know<br>much more sort of brown energy Channel<br>dominated and and you have you know I<br>guess<br>more well yeah less Dynamic basic<br>resources not necessarily so impacted by<br>top down effects is that something that<br>I think okay I see you're saying so if<br>you if you have like a if you have the<br>capacity to to work through that organic<br>matter for many more months after its<br>delivery then that could be stabilizing<br>and I guess then the open question for<br>me would be are the Aquatic<br>invertebrates is their life history set<br>up to do that right are they able to<br>adjust their life history timing which<br>might be set to flow events or might be<br>set to day lengths or things like that<br>right so do you actually get that change<br>and what concerns me and I think we see<br>this in a lot of data senses what<br>happens is that organism that can<br>complete their life cycle quickly and<br>can have multiple Generations per year<br>capitalize and microbes win right so<br>what you would want to say from a<br>biodiversity sort of food web stability<br>perspective is that energy can now be<br>used throughout the winter who's using<br>it right and if it's a bunch of microbes<br>and we basically enhance the microbial<br>Loop right then that actually isn't that<br>isn't actually sustaining animal<br>production uh it's just increasing<br>microbial respiratory losses I don't<br>know the answer to that right because I<br>don't we don't have any secondary<br>production data from back in the late<br>196 fish there there is fish data but<br>I'm not so if anybody knows anyone who<br>wants to come do an amazing um um study<br>of fish I think it' be fascinating so<br>Charlie did fish secondary production<br>bugs um yeah I guess run from all this<br>in a in a broader theme is what we get<br>challenged with here is can we use<br>metabolism as a metric of stream health<br>or is it just two variable across<br>systems flows light availabilities<br>tobidi um that's the big barrier for<br>well at least within Nea for us trying<br>to increase work in that space is that<br>it it thems to<br>be not very on the ground it's very<br>theoretical it's the coms figure<br>I think it would be more like uh akin to<br>the way we've thought about flow regimes<br>where it's not like there's not an ideal<br>metabolic regime it's what was the<br>metabolic regime how's it been altered<br>and can we move it back right or what's<br>the reference condition metabolic regime<br>that you're trying you know that what's<br>the closest analog site that's<br>experiencing the same flow regime but<br>isn't got the same turbidity regime for<br>example right you certainly wouldn't<br>want to be aiming for I think sometimes<br>people talk about energetics in a really<br>oversimplified way that's dangerous<br>right it's not like having a super high<br>productivity system is awesome that's an<br>Al right so we it's not it's not you're<br>trying to maximize the energetics it's<br>that you're trying to ACH and that's why<br>the regime is so important you're trying<br>to achieve a magnitude and a timing that<br>looks like um the past or looks like the<br>best case scenario in the Basin that<br>you're working in right um that's<br>realistic so I think it's it's more the<br>timing than it is the<br>magnitude yeah so you need previous data<br>sets so it's sort of hard or you have<br>change best case scenario like if you're<br>working in a third order segment of the<br>wado and there's another third order<br>segment in a catchen that's relatively<br>protected what does that look like right<br>and and how different are they from each<br>other so I think that the comparison we<br>did from our Urban and our forested<br>catchment are pretty interesting it's a<br>same size wed right it's the same<br>topography the same geology completely<br>different productivity patterns largely<br>because of the sort of massive organic<br>subsidy and massive hydrologic subsidy<br>which are leading to these boom bust<br>Dynam Dynamics and I think if we could<br>remove those boom bu Dynamics and bring<br>back a spring<br>Peak right then that actually would be<br>pretty good evidence that we've we've<br>solved a lot of issues I think it's it's<br>almost like an emergent property of all<br>the underlying things that you're doing<br>to the system right so you could say if<br>you're aiming for that you'd actually<br>have to accomplish a lot of mechanistic<br>shifts in the thermal regime hydr<br>machine Nutri machine it's an integrator<br>it's an integrator absolutely y and<br>easier than secondary production which<br>is really hard hey good to see you good<br>to see you too um thanks for a<br>presentation one thing I was wondering<br>about um I think about Peter Raymond's P<br>shun work when you're looking at like<br>stream networks and in response to you<br>know changes and stream flashiness and<br>if you're looking at or disturbance of<br>engine looking at individual sites how<br>much of that the observed change that<br>you see in response to a disturbance<br>event um actually is change that's<br>occurring there versus you're just<br>seeing<br>the the metabolic signature of a<br>different location Upstream right<br>depending on the size of the rate of the<br>flow and maybe it doesn't matter<br>ultimately but it's just trying to<br>unpack what's the cause of it if it's<br>changes that are current there or if<br>it's just you're sort of integrating<br>different reges or LS different<br>distances Upstream in your signal um<br>depending on the flashiness and then<br>also because flashiness might correspond<br>to like the depth and the amount of cans<br>would cover the size so how how do you<br>disentangle<br>some of that absolutely does the model<br>set up so that you know flashiness in<br>the headwaters has a lot bigger impact<br>than flash yeah which is probably lower<br>light to begin right absolutely so I<br>mean I I keep thinking about it like a<br>lot of what warming and um flashier<br>flows are doing is reducing the<br>resonance time of autot tropes and<br>organic matter right so you just have<br>less time to act on things and you're<br>pushing that you're you're having more<br>and so a lot of what we did was look at<br>hydrologic export of things become and<br>respiratory export of things becomes a<br>bigger loss term under the hotter and<br>Flash year scenario right so that means<br>that you know in most river systems was<br>that mean we're shoving a lot of stuff<br>into reservoirs in my part of the world<br>right um where it's maybe it's gonna be<br>buried right that might be great from a<br>carbon burial standpoint but not that<br>great for producing aquatic organisms<br>right so if you're that's why I really<br>want to make sure we're not thinking<br>purely about the carbon budget but we're<br>thinking about how do we sustain the<br>food webs of Rivers right um how do we<br>sustain the diversity of Oran in these<br>systems I think this has major<br>implications for that because you also<br>don't have the same Oran with living in<br>a main stem large river as you do in the<br>headwaters right a lot of the diversity<br>in river systems is held in the<br>headwaters and one of the main outcomes<br>of that modeling exercise is that<br>Headwaters are going to be<br>starved under under these scenarios and<br>sort of realistic scenarios um if you<br>put into in context with that too that<br>most of them are dry as well they're<br>just it's hard it's going to be harder<br>and harder to make a living in a<br>headlock um so that's kind of I guess<br>what I would say is sort of the main<br>take-home is that you're you're changing<br>the rule set and one of the things we<br>explor in that paper is that if you're<br>trying to study climate change what you<br>think is happening will be really<br>contingent on where you are in the<br>network for those very reasons right<br>whether or not you're in the Headwater<br>and you're having everything lost from<br>the system or you could have other<br>places that are being subsidized and so<br>that's going to look really different in<br>patterns okay<br>we should wrap up here Tim would you<br>mind coming<br>enjoyed yeah before I close um this part<br>presentation down this open invitation<br>this Friday morning I'm going to get one<br>of the<br>uh of the cousins Li to he does the T<br>mul tourism walking sculpture art tour<br>and he talks about this is in Hamilton<br>he talks about the importance of the W<br>River to the E so he's the son of uh<br>sh Shir tutel who's our qu here at the<br>University so this Friday um Liz is<br>going to uh do this walking tour so uh<br>Emily's going to jump on it but if<br>anyone else wants to uh go along and go<br>on the walking tour it's about an hour<br>hour and a half it's quite informative<br>children's been on it we get a lot of<br>our visiting uh researchers and<br>academics going on as well as to just<br>learn about the significance of the<br>sculptures but also the art and the<br>importance of the river so if anyone<br>wants to go along on that come to me<br>after this and just give me your name<br>and I'll put you down on the list there<br>okay<br>everyone<br>everybody</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
