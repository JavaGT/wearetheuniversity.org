uh<br>here to to to the house that stands here<br>welcome and you may you stand forever um<br>but in case there is some risk of that<br>not happening um please note the exits<br>and uh in the case of an earthquake drop<br>cover and hold uh but uh uh assembly<br>points are outside the building follow<br>may we remember those that have passed<br>within our wider f<br>um<br>Richard welcome good evening everyone<br>welcome to this inaugural professorial<br>lecture where we celebrate the promotion<br>of Professor Rachel mlan to that title<br>um my name is Richard Blakey I'm Deputy<br>Vice Chancellor research and Enterprise<br>and I'm here to welcome you tonight uh<br>and and uh give you a little bit of<br>information about what lies ahead uh and<br>then uh uh some of our other esteemed U<br>guests our other esteemed members of the<br>academic party will play other roles uh<br>Lyle Anderson acting Dan of DSM will<br>introduce Rachel and then after the<br>event uh Professor Sim man will um say<br>some vote of thanks and then our PVC uh<br>Professor Megan Gibbons will uh have a<br>very special uh role to invite us all<br>back to the staff Club should the have<br>gone well um these are wonderful<br>celebrations of uh the life of academic<br>the academic life in the University uh<br>we uh apply very rigorous and high<br>standards to appointment and promotion<br>to the professorial positions at the<br>University of Vago requiring uh levels<br>of um Service uh performance and<br>Leadership at the highest standards over<br>a sustained period and we then uh celebr<br>great when someone achieves that through<br>inviting them to talk about the things<br>that have led to their to their<br>achievement over their careers and we<br>have seen uh in Rachel mlan as Linley<br>will say in more detail a remarkable<br>career to date um it's very unusual I<br>don't think it's ever been the case<br>before at one of these where I've looked<br>at the uh at the professor's CV and said<br>that exemplifies interdisciplinarity to<br>the most extreme degree by having three<br>degrees from otago uh awarded by three<br>of our different academic divisions and<br>having a a teaching and research career<br>that includes uh teaching into the<br>fourth of our academic divisions as well<br>so uh the ability to<br>train uh through a number of disciplines<br>to transfer that knowledge uh into your<br>principal focus in public health and<br>nutrition exemplifies what we uh expect<br>out of the best and brightest of<br>academics you've contributed to key<br>Global issues and health affecting lives<br>uh as well as that you bring more than a<br>decade of uh experience as a<br>practitioner into teaching and research<br>so also exemplifying the the deep and<br>meaningful connection between uh<br>research teaching and practice and our<br>academic divisions so on behalf of the<br>University um Rachel I would like to<br>offer our sincere congratulations on<br>achieving this promotion and uh we'll um<br>ask that the audience to join me in<br>congratulating you uh as I also uh<br>invite uh Professor L Anderson to give<br>you a more formal introduction to the<br>congratulations thank you Richard<br>tenot know my har<br>Colin Anderson<br>tooa welcome to everyone who are is<br>present here and to those also attending<br>online my name is Linley Anderson and I<br>am the acting dean of the denan school<br>of medicine it is my role and great<br>pleasure to introduce you to Professor<br>Rachel McLean and to tell you a little<br>bit about her but before we do that I'd<br>just like to welcome and acknowledge<br>some pretty significant people in<br>Rachel's life<br>first of all those who are in the room<br>today her father Dr Malcolm<br>mlan her husband uh Jonathan otley otley<br>sorry her son Luke otley and her<br>daughter Sylvia otley and her partner<br>sersa bin uh we'd also like to<br>acknowledge her family attending online<br>and they include her son Nathaniel otley<br>and his wife aara Mondo uh and they<br>attend from New York and also her<br>sister-in-law Dr Denise Atkins from<br>Oakland so welcome to you<br>all uh now on to telling you a little<br>bit about Rachel so some of you may not<br>know but Rachel actually grew up in<br>dened and she came to Academia via<br>clinical route she was first a GP before<br>becoming an academic and now Professor<br>mlan is a Public Health Physician with<br>an expertise in nutrition one of the<br>focuses of her research is the<br>relationship between food nutrition and<br>chronic disease including cardiovascular<br>disease cancer obesity and<br>diabetes her research therefore examines<br>the environmental influences that<br>determine how and what people eat with a<br>focus on improving health and improving<br>Equity much of Rachel's research focuses<br>on public health approaches to re ucing<br>salt intake her work contributes to<br>International best practice and<br>scientific debate and has informed<br>dietary recommendations both nationally<br>and<br>internationally her research connections<br>with national and international Scholars<br>explores the ways to implement effective<br>policy in this area Rachel enjoys<br>working with collaborators across aora<br>and supervising her research students<br>she has also undertaken research for and<br>advised the New Zealand government<br>Ministry of Health Stroke Foundation and<br>heart foundation and hopes to change<br>policy and food environments to make<br>healthy eating easier for individuals<br>Foo and<br>communities now on a more personal level<br>Rachel loves music she uh plays the<br>piano and she's an Aid reader and she<br>also likes to grow flowers um so she'll<br>surely appreciate what's on the left<br>beside me so it is my very great<br>pleasure to welcome Professor Rachel<br>mlan to the stage and please join with<br>me and welcoming her thank<br>water<br>okay<br>um it is an enormous privilege to be<br>here tonight and I'm very grateful to<br>see friends and colleagues here as well<br>as my family um as it's customary on<br>these occasions I'm going to be talking<br>a bit about my journey to becoming a<br>professor and then on to my research<br>before making some important<br>acknowledgements can I just get this on<br>go okay when thinking about how to<br>approach this lecture I was immediately<br>reminded of a song from one of my<br>favorite albums remain in light by<br>Talking Heads and I asked myself what<br>well how did I get here my journey to<br>becoming a professor hasn't been a<br>typical or obvious one I certainly<br>didn't have a plan when I left school<br>that led directly to where I am now I<br>did things that interested me and tried<br>things out over the years in a beautiful<br>house with a<br>beautiful you may ask yourself<br>well did get however I do think that<br>what I have learned has infuenced and<br>contributed to my current role in public<br>health so I'm going to talk a bit about<br>that in the first part of this<br>lecture as a family we've had a long<br>association with the University of otago<br>over five<br>generations both my parents are<br>graduates of the University of otago and<br>I remember attending both their<br>graduation ceremonies in the denan town<br>hall when I was a<br>child my mother Vivian seen here was a<br>Pianist and a musician and has a<br>bachelor of music with honors from ooto<br>she worked a lot over the years playing<br>music with both staff and students of<br>the music department in Mar Mahal and<br>elsewhere my father<br>Malcolm completed a PhD in religious<br>studies while he was a senior lecturer<br>in the department of phenomenology of<br>religion and this is his pH D gown that<br>I'm wearing<br>today on my mother's side both her<br>parents are graduates of otago Lawrence<br>um was a graduate and law and um Francis<br>In classical<br>studies uh francis's father was Ernest<br>marrington he was Master at nox<br>theological College which is now part of<br>the university and he was the minister<br>at First Presbyterian Church in Mara<br>place on L's side his father was Charles<br>North who was a lecturer In Obstetrics<br>and Gynecology at the medical<br>school my husband Jonathan is a diploma<br>in teaching from the denan College of<br>Education which was not part of the<br>University at the time but is now we<br>have three children Nathaniel Luke and<br>Sylvia uh Nathaniel has a bachelor of<br>music with honors majoring in music<br>composition and violin performance and<br>his wife<br>allara has degrees from ooto in law and<br>music and Luke has a Bachelor of Arts<br>psychology I was born in 19 67 with<br>decimal currency in Sergeant Peppers<br>Lonely Hearts Club Band I was the eldest<br>child of my parents Malcolm and Vivian<br>and here we are in the mountains of<br>Northern India where we were living at<br>the<br>time we moved to denen when I was about<br>seven and I attended Northeast Valley<br>Primary School deden north intermediate<br>and Logan Park High School I enjoyed<br>school and enjoyed the wide range of<br>opportunities I had um including in<br>science Humanities music and drama<br>I particularly remember this campaign<br>which was running when I was at high<br>school girls can do anything I found it<br>true I left school at the end of 1984<br>and got my first job at the University<br>of Oto working in the Computing Center<br>as a summer student my job was entering<br>data into the computer from paper um<br>survey forms um my first taste of<br>University rech<br>I enrolled initially in a BSC but<br>changed quickly to a ba majoring in<br>history with a minor in<br>philosophy I was lucky to be taught by<br>many people who will be familiar faces<br>to those in the room and I learned a lot<br>that underpins my public health practice<br>today I studied New Zealand history with<br>Tom Brooking Eric olssen and Barbara<br>Brooks I learned about the impacts of<br>colonization politics and the origins of<br>the welfare state I learned about t or<br>white hangi and remember when Claudia<br>Orange's important book was published in<br>1987 I distinctly remember a tutorial<br>with Barbara Brooks in which we<br>discussed why Tangy day and Titi which<br>profoundly changed my<br>thinking I also learned about the<br>processes and impacts of colonization in<br>other places in India with Hummer Cloud<br>pictured here and across Africa with<br>at the end of my ba I decided that what<br>I really wanted to do was to work with<br>people and I was accepted into a tago<br>medical school this was a very different<br>experience the institution was<br>hierarchical and conservative and I<br>learned that maybe girls couldn't do<br>anything after all or or at least not as<br>easily this was a huge culture shock and<br>I was grateful to have a number of good<br>friends in my class as allies uh sherei<br>Kang Al Cameron Rachel Thompson Glenda<br>barar and Sue Bellington in<br>particular I'm pleased to say that<br>things have changed very much at the<br>medical school since that<br>time this was also the time when the<br>findings of the National cical Cancer<br>inquiry led by Dame Sylvia cartright<br>were causing shock waves across the<br>medical profession the establishment of<br>the office of the health and disability<br>commission commissioner the code of<br>health and disability consumer rights<br>new guidelines for ethical practice and<br>research and the establishment of<br>independent ethics committees profoundly<br>changed the medical practice and<br>Altera I graduated with my medical<br>degree in 1993 and Jonathan and I moved<br>to gizon where I spent 2 years as a<br>house surgeon at gbon<br>hospital I went there to experience<br>practice in a small hospital and foran<br>and surf a different life experience so<br>there's gizon here in the Tida region<br>I was not prepared for the profound<br>inequities in health I encountered<br>largely and disproportionately<br>experienced by Marty these included<br>rheumatic heart<br>disease chronic renal failure severe<br>heart failure and cellulitis and<br>workplace and other<br>injury I saw firsthand the inequities in<br>access to the determinance of health and<br>in healthc care and what I now know is<br>institutional<br>racism I also learned importance of a<br>diverse Workforce that reflects the<br>community we live in I was lucky to work<br>with many skilled and competent Marty<br>nurses and other health professionals<br>who understood culture and contexts and<br>the importance of farno for health and<br>well-being and they shared some of that<br>knowledge with<br>me at this point I decided on a career<br>in general practice and started this<br>with a series of locom based into puya<br>Hospital up<br>here traveling to clinics across the Tia<br>region from um T aroa down to tokumaru<br>Bay after a short period of<br>international travel Jonathan and I<br>returned to denen where I did my formal<br>GP training and we started our<br>family the thing about clinical medicine<br>is that you're privileged to learn a lot<br>about the lives of a wide variety of<br>people I learned many lessons that have<br>informed my approach to Public<br>Health I learned that people don't want<br>to be unhealthy even those that appear<br>to make obviously unhealthy<br>choices there are a range of different<br>factors that influence Health including<br>competing priorities environmental<br>influences poverty or wealth racism and<br>access to health care these are not<br>distributed evenly and so blaming<br>individuals for their health status is<br>unfair I worked on a variety of GP<br>practices across Den Eden and saw many<br>different models of primary healthc care<br>provision but Public Health beckoned as<br>an opportunity to work further Upstream<br>in the prevention<br>space I completed my Public Health<br>Medicine training and see myself very<br>much as a Public Health Physician and<br>have an active role in the New Zealand<br>Medicine during my Public Health<br>Medicine training I was lucky to have a<br>placement in the Edgar diabetes and<br>obesity Research Center with Jim man and<br>discovered my passion for food and<br>nutrition research which is largely what<br>I do today so why food my interest in<br>food wasn't new my father Malcolm has<br>always shared his interest in and<br>passion for good food as you can see in<br>this ODT clip from<br>1979 I remember going to stay with Dad<br>in the school holidays and planning our<br>meals and recipes from around the world<br>especially from India dad also took us<br>to interesting restaurants and we<br>learned about the links between food and<br>culture dad is an excellent cook and<br>manages this in a wide variety of<br>settings including on some of the many<br>children and of course food is much more<br>than nourishment it is a central part of<br>family and community life we celebrate<br>important occasions by sharing food<br>these are photos from our Faro but this<br>is true of many families as well as<br>wider Faro and Community<br>groups food connects us to our<br>environment through Gathering food or<br>growing it in family and community<br>garden settings we cannot have food<br>without healthy sustainable Food Systems<br>and a healthy<br>environment increasingly we are learning<br>about the value of ancient and<br>Indigenous knowledge to inform<br>there is also something deeply personal<br>about food about providing food for<br>loved ones the giving and acceptance of<br>food is fundamental to relationships and<br>The Human<br>Experience I'm fond of this quote from a<br>Cochran review which just happens to be<br>about tube feeding patients with SE<br>severe<br>dementia we all know this food not only<br>sustains us but provides pleasure social<br>and cultural opportunities and can also<br>be an act of Love whether you are<br>preparing food for someone you care for<br>or eating food that has been prepared<br>for<br>you which brings me to the<br>science as I mentioned during my Public<br>Health Training I got a position at the<br>Edgar diabetes and obesity Research<br>Center with Jim and others as project<br>manager for the national evaluation of<br>the healthy eating healthy action or<br>heha strategy<br>this was a national public health<br>strategy to improve health and reduce<br>obesity in type 2 diabetes and it was<br>set up by the then labor coalition<br>government from around<br>2003 if you look at the structure<br>diagram which I've included here on the<br>right you can see that it was<br>underpinned by fundamental public health<br>goals and principles the Treaty of white<br>hungi reducing<br>inequalities uh it was ambitious in its<br>vision and used the approaches for<br>action of the World Health Organization<br>Ottawa Charter for health promotion<br>identifying key priority groups and a<br>focus on intersectoral and<br>community-based action the national<br>evaluation that we were working on was<br>designed to inform best practice over<br>program however there was a general<br>election in 2008 and heha was completely<br>cut in the first 100 Days of the New<br>National lead coalition government<br>programs across the country were cut as<br>was our<br>evaluation there was damage to<br>communities Community Trust and<br>Community<br>engagement so why was he hard cut were<br>politics intervened in the leadup to the<br>election there was a lot of rhetoric<br>about the program phrases such as Nanny<br>state food police were being used to<br>undermine the program with a push to<br>emphasize personal or individual<br>responsibility for food Choice rather<br>than creating supportive<br>environments unfortunately what we know<br>is that in initiatives that prioritize<br>personal responsibility usually<br>disproportionately benefit people who<br>are already privileged and they're not<br>focused on<br>Equity our evaluation only managed to<br>publish some preliminary findings before<br>down having finished my Public Health<br>Medicine training I was Keen to pursue a<br>career in public health research and was<br>awarded a health research Council<br>clinical research training Fellowship to<br>undertake PhD<br>study I sat down with Jim and we talked<br>about potential areas of research I<br>wanted to do something food related that<br>could have direct application to<br>influence policy we talked with some<br>people at the New Zealand Food Safety<br>Authority or nzfsa which doesn't exist<br>anymore who had an interest in dietary<br>sodium or salt and I going to use those<br>terms<br>interchangeably um for a while because<br>the vast majority of sodium that we<br>consume comes from salt or sodium<br>chloride inid say indicated that it<br>would be useful to have someone conduct<br>an Evidence review and to work on how to<br>interpret the sodium results of the New<br>Zealand adult nutrition survey uh shown<br>down here which was in the field at the<br>time I started my PhD in the Department<br>of Medicine supervised by Jim man Janet<br>Hawk and Sheila<br>Williams my first task was to prepare an<br>Evidence summary um which is here in<br>this I outlined the strong evidence that<br>links high salt intake with adverse<br>Health outcomes particularly raised<br>blood pressure and cardiovascular<br>disease population level salt reduction<br>strategies have been shown to be both<br>effective and cost effective Ive for<br>reducing cardiovascular disease and that<br>is why these are a priority for wh to<br>reduce non-communicable disease<br>worldwide in my review I outlined the<br>rationale for an intervention to lower<br>population salt intake in New<br>Zealand an effective Equitable<br>intervention would need to focus on<br>environmental change through food<br>reformulation rather than expecting<br>people to change their habits<br>individually<br>but because at the time um from a policy<br>perspective we had moved to a focus on<br>individual responsibility I was<br>interested in investigating tools to<br>enable people to make informed food<br>purchasing decisions and so conducted<br>labeling I interviewed people about<br>their thoughts and experiences and then<br>conducted an online experiment testing<br>different nutrition labeling formats on<br>fictitional brands of baked beans you<br>can see those<br>here um what we found was that the<br>nutrition information panel usually on<br>the back of the product on the back of<br>the can was difficult to interpret<br>compared to the front of pack labels<br>such as the traffic light label which<br>you see down here um and the percent<br>daily intake label which is over here um<br>the health star rating wasn't a thing at<br>the time this predates the health star<br>rating um the traffic light label was<br>the easiest for people to understand<br>they could easily understand that red<br>was bad and green was go um but the um<br>Health Rel nutrition related claims such<br>as reduced salt here and low salt up<br>here were particularly powerful even if<br>they were not obviously backed up by the<br>nutrition information on display such as<br>here in the middle<br>can our findings reinforced that if<br>we're going to emphasize personal<br>responsibility then we need regulation<br>to ensure that people are adequately<br>informed or as is outlined in this<br>graphic um from a Canadian campaign to<br>improve food labeling if I'm about to<br>eat three days worth of sodium I think I<br>know the other main study related to<br>interpreting the results of the adult<br>nutrition survey the survey used three<br>methods to assess andtake of dietary<br>salt or sodium a 24-hour diet recall<br>where participants were asked to list<br>everything they consumed the previous<br>day questions about dietary habits and a<br>single spot urine collection was made so<br>that's what that looks like here just a<br>small<br>amount the single or spot urine was a<br>convenient alternative to the gold<br>standard method of measuring sodium<br>intake using a 24-hour urine excretion<br>of sodium as a measure of intake in a<br>24-hour urine people collect all the<br>urine they pass over a 24-hour period<br>which is more accurate but less<br>convenient than a single or spot urine<br>collection my work involved comparing<br>the accuracy of the different methods of<br>measurement I conducted a validation<br>study comparing the results from a spot<br>versus a 24-hour urine in order to<br>inform interpretation of the spot urine<br>survey this is important because the<br>measurement of people's usual salt<br>intake<br>matters in most societies salt intake<br>varies quite a lot from day to day<br>depending on what we eat and how much we<br>eat and so we what we want to know is<br>someone's usual intake or their average<br>intake measuring the average usual salt<br>intake across a population matters so we<br>can assess whether we need Public Health<br>interventions to reduce intake and to<br>monitor Progressive interventions<br>against specific targets so we can<br>assure that we can have an<br>evidence-based<br>strategy it's also important to measure<br>usual salt intake at an individual level<br>in epidemiological studies that assess<br>the relationship between intake and<br>health related<br>outcomes so how should we do<br>this in populations we use a large<br>representative sample and measure intake<br>on a single day for each person<br>the large sample can overcome individual<br>day-to-day<br>variability and some unreliability in<br>the measure as long as the measure is<br>valid we can produce a valid mean level<br>and we can see that here on the top<br>right corner of this image as all the<br>individual values in black center around<br>the truth or the<br>bullseye we will come up with an average<br>that is close to the truth even though<br>each individual measur doesn't sit<br>there however in epidemiological studies<br>we must have an accurate measure at the<br>individual level or our results will be<br>misleading so we need individual results<br>to be much more reliable we need an<br>accurate measure for each individual as<br>right which reminds me again of my<br>favorite Talking Heads album if we don't<br>measure things properly inide<br>our results will be<br>misleading I've spent many years working<br>on the question of how we can measure<br>usual salt intake and spot urine and<br>other methods for populations and<br>individuals and this is the area where<br>my research has probably had the<br>greatest International<br>impact the most common way to interpret<br>spot urine results is to convert these<br>results into an estimate of 24-hour<br>urinary excretion using a specific<br>formula formula are derived from<br>prediction equations from regression<br>analyses one that is most commonly used<br>is the c saki formula here initially<br>published in<br>1993 derived from a study in Japanese<br>population and this is evolved to this<br>formula which is the one that we use<br>today um you don't need to follow the<br>details but what I would like you to<br>notice is that these formula include<br>measures of age of weight of height and<br>sex when you compare the estimates from<br>spot urine with the more accurate<br>reference 24-hour urine over the same<br>period you can see whether using a spot<br>urine is a suitable alternative<br>measure um I'm going to show you a<br>couple of results from our most recent<br>analysis but others including my PhD<br>work show similar things so this graph<br>on the left plots the reference measured<br>intake from 24-hour urine on the<br>x-axis and um the estimated 24-hour<br>excretion from using the Kawasaki<br>formula on the Y AIS here each dot<br>represents an individual participants<br>results if the estimate is accurate then<br>all the dots will sit along or near to<br>this red line of no difference you can<br>see quite clearly that that is not the<br>case the second graph looks at this in a<br>different way looking at<br>agreement again we have the measured<br>intake on the x-axis from the 24-hour<br>urine but this time on the Y AIS we have<br>the difference between the two<br>measures again if the estimate is<br>accurate then most of the dots will sit<br>on the red line or very close to the red<br>line and again you see that that's not<br>the<br>case you may also notice that the<br>estimates are higher at than the<br>measured at low levels of intake and the<br>opposite is true at high levels of<br>intake and you'd expect that from a<br>formula derived this way<br>so why does that<br>matter as I said an epidemiological<br>studies such as cohort studies or<br>intervention trials we assess the<br>relationship between usual salt intake<br>and health outcomes in each individual<br>so that we can make generalizations<br>about what happens over groups of people<br>and<br>populations what we see from well-<br>conducted studies is there is a<br>relationship between High assault intake<br>and high blood pressure and we know from<br>a huge number of trials that high blood<br>pressure is associated with increased<br>risk of cardiovascular disease<br>stroke there's also some evidence of a<br>direct<br>relationship if we use an estimate from<br>spot urine rather than direct<br>measurement from 24-hour urine to<br>measure usual salt intake we use a<br>formula that includes BMI age and<br>sex however we know that these are also<br>directly related to blood pressure and<br>cardiovascular disease so things get a<br>bit<br>messy so does it matter well yes it<br>does these graphs show some results from<br>the long-term followup of the trials of<br>hypertension prevention study a<br>randomized control trial where the<br>intervention group consumed a low salt<br>diet and the control group continued<br>with their normal<br>diet participants collected several<br>24-hour urines at Baseline and the<br>investigators followed them up over 20<br>years noting any subsequent Health<br>outcomes the graphs show the<br>relationship between usual salt intake<br>on the x-axis and all cause mortality or<br>death on the Y<br>AIS the graph on the left analyzes the<br>urine as a 24-hour urine and the graph<br>on the right analyzes the urine with the<br>Kawasaki<br>formula so on the left we see a<br>relatively linear association between<br>salt and taken mortality indicating that<br>the higher the salt intake is the<br>greater the risk of<br>dying however when the researchers used<br>the same analyze the same urine results<br>with a Kawasaki formula this<br>relationship turned into a j-shaped<br>curve suggesting that low salt intake<br>was harmful compared to sort of middling<br>salt<br>intake um so low salt intake looks like<br>it's associated with increased<br>mortality the alers of this study um who<br>are colleagues of mine and others have<br>shown that this difference is a direct<br>result of using the formula and as an<br>error despite this a large a number of<br>large studies using spot urine have been<br>published suggesting that lower intakes<br>of salt can be<br>harmful this has resulted in some<br>controversy in the scientific literature<br>about the need for public health<br>interventions and I've just shown a<br>couple of titles here um just a few<br>examples in the scientific Community<br>controversy and debate can be<br>interesting however it can have serious<br>consequences um he's an example of this<br>getting into the popular press and<br>undermining Public Health messages so um<br>I particularly am fond of this now salt<br>is safe to eat Health fascists like me<br>proved wrong after lecturing us all for<br>years um<br>so this undermines public health<br>messages to individuals and communities<br>um but these studies can also result in<br>delays in government action um<br>particularly with implementing Public<br>Health interventions and I know that<br>that's what happened in New Zealand um<br>when some of these studies came<br>out which brings me to the purpose of my<br>research much of this work seems a bit<br>esoteric in fact one of my co-authors<br>and collaborators said to me one day<br>interesting I started doing this work<br>because nzfsa wanted help in<br>interpreting the spot urine results from<br>the adult nutrition survey our ongoing<br>work in this area has directly informed<br>Public Health interventions dietary<br>guidelines and nutrient reference values<br>worldwide and helped to deliver constant<br>consistent evidencebased messages sorry<br>consistent evidence-based messages to<br>the public and to policy<br>makers with colleagues I've conducted a<br>range of systematic reviews that have<br>shown on average up here in the top<br>right that 24-hour urine contains about<br>93% of sodium ingested over the same<br>24-hour<br>period um that an apped analysis of over<br>10,000 participants from 34 countries<br>spot urine is an unreliable and invalid<br>measure of usual salt intake in<br>individuals and and in some of these<br>others shown that commonly used dietary<br>assessment methods such as 24-hour diet<br>recall tend to underestimate salt intake<br>and I've shown CLA Cameron's lovely<br>Forest plot here um that shows that the<br>milligrams I've also been involved in<br>writing and Publishing a range of<br>letters to the editor in reviews in both<br>the scientific and lay literature<br>explaining the science and fighting<br>disinformation in this area I've just<br>here with other colleagues I've been<br>involved in advocacy on different topics<br>such as these examples with Jim and<br>other<br>colleagues here we responded to a number<br>of articles in academic journals and in<br>the popular press which were extoling<br>the virtues of very low carbohydrate<br>diets for health we believe that this<br>was contrary to the totality of the<br>evidence and nutrition science and<br>outlined our rationale and commentaries<br>and<br>letters one of the highlights of my role<br>has been working with in supporting<br>research students in a diverse range of<br>research that relates to food and<br>nutrition and I'm going to mention just<br>a few<br>examples Celia Apprentice shown here was<br>a masters of dietetic student who<br>examined the impact of fast foods on<br>total salt intake this involved her<br>purchasing takeaway foods from<br>independent operators in Wellington and<br>in denen homogenizing them in a blender<br>and analyzing them in the laboratory<br>including combusting samples in the bomb<br>calorimeter she showed that takeaway<br>foods make a substantial contribution to<br>salt intake particularly for regular<br>Foods I was lucky to um co-supervise<br>some of Brian McKenzie's PhD work when<br>she was based at the George instit for<br>Global Health in Sydney she conducted<br>some really interesting research in Fiji<br>which explored how strong gendered<br>beliefs around food and food provision<br>were being challenged in contemporary<br>fij by changing societal Norms about<br>food and work and environmental<br>change Nissa would just to he joined us<br>from Indonesia and was co-supervised by<br>Helen harkam and Robin Turner Nissa<br>conducted an in-depth analysis of body<br>size changes over time in Indonesia<br>using the Indonesian Family Life survey<br>she produced An Elegant trajectory<br>analysis of changes among adults showing<br>an overall trend of increasing body size<br>2014 um particularly in the small<br>highrisk group which she's called group<br>three in this<br>graph uh this will have profound<br>implications for health in Indonesia<br>with increasing prevalence of obesity<br>and obesity obesity related<br>non-communicable<br>disease so when we celebrated nissa's<br>cake um and when Nissa defended her PhD<br>in her PhD oral she was a able to<br>t-shirt uh Nan sing Wang came from<br>Singapore and recently completed her PhD<br>under challenging conditions during Co<br>lockdowns with funding from the ministry<br>for primary Industries nans sing used a<br>novel method to measure the proportion<br>of total salt intake that comes from<br>discretionary sources uh that's the salt<br>that you add in cooking and at the table<br>to do this she fused table salt with<br>lithium in a very high temperature<br>muffle furnace um she went through a few<br>muffle furnaces actually and then<br>measured the lithium in the urine of<br>study<br>participants this work was important for<br>informing Public Health interventions to<br>reduce salt intake while maintaining<br>iodine intake since iodi salt is an<br>important source of iodine uh and CLE<br>Cameron here and Sheila and I celebrated<br>here public health research is most<br>definitely a team sport you can't do it<br>alone and it's inherently<br>interdisciplinary and nature so there<br>are many many people I would like to<br>thank people who I have worked with and<br>people who have supported me over the<br>years I'm not going to attempt to name<br>them all thank you to everyone who has<br>been a co-supervisor a supervisor a<br>collaborator a co-author or a research<br>student I would like to particularly<br>thank colleagues in preventive and<br>social medicine where I currently sit in<br>the center for biostatistics at the<br>Edgar diabetes and obesity Research<br>Center and human nutrition and others<br>across the<br>university there are however a few<br>people I would like to particularly<br>thank people who have been important<br>mentors friends supporters and<br>collaborators um Jim man has been a very<br>important mentor and um collaborator and<br>a good friend over many years uh Helen<br>ises works at the University of ockland<br>also works in the salt space and I've<br>done a lot of work withen that I haven't<br>even mentioned<br>tonight uh Norm Campbell uh from the<br>University of Calgary in Canada has been<br>a a very important collaborator in the<br>advocacy space Louise<br>signal a a good Mentor and a very good<br>friend over the years she's based at the<br>University of otago<br>Wellington Jackie Webster from the<br>George Institute for inter for Global<br>Health in Sydney Sheila SK um from from<br>the Department of Human nutrition uh<br>expert and iodine and iodine and salt go<br>together very nicely and um she's also<br>been a very good friend CLA Cameron a<br>biostatistician has been an important<br>collaborator and um Richie and Sandia<br>who have been steadfast and lovely<br>friends over many many years so thank<br>you very<br>much I'm very very grateful for all the<br>love and support I've had from my family<br>here's a photo of my immediate family um<br>for Denise this is<br>blood um and you can see here my parents<br>uh Malcolm and Vivian husband Jonathan<br>and my three children uh Luke Nathaniel<br>and<br>Sylvia my children are without doubt my<br>greatest achievement and I'm extremely<br>proud of them uh there are two very<br>important family members that are not in<br>this photo uh Nathaniel's wife aara<br>mecko who took this photo<br>and Sylvia's partner suha<br>bin um the location is also significant<br>uh the photo was taken by Alara<br>immediately after Nathaniel's honors<br>recital and Mar Mahal which has been the<br>location for so much of our family's<br>musical<br>life unfortunately my mother Vivian<br>isn't well enough to be here this<br>evening thank you so much for coming and<br>I'm going to leave the last word to one<br>of my all times F alltime favorites<br>joany<br>Mitchel<br>hopefully K Rachel Koto C<br>man uh I have the great privilege Rachel<br>of being asked to thank you tonight and<br>I do say as a colleague and friend of<br>longstanding uh I think Sheila and I<br>were sort of coaches were we Sheila in<br>that in our outfit that we had on in the<br>so as a coach as well perhaps but very<br>importantly I've been asked to do so on<br>on behalf of Robin Turner uh hod of the<br>Department of preventive and social<br>medicine as most people here will know<br>Robin is very sorry not to be here<br>tonight because she's not well but she<br>has asked me to to uh not inexpressive<br>regret but I quote send massive<br>congratulations on behalf of herself and<br>the whole<br>department I was very delighted when you<br>decided that you wanted to do a PhD<br>because I thought that you were ideally<br>qualified to become an academic and I<br>think Rachel has given quite a good<br>indication of why she was so well<br>qualified that tremendous background<br>that she had in uh primary care and<br>general practice and in public health um<br>I was particularly impressed by the fact<br>that she had done a ba in history and<br>especially that she'd converted from a<br>BSC because i' I'd always wanted to do<br>more study in Humanities but I was never<br>brave enough to do it before I started<br>medicine and uh Rachel did it um it also<br>proved to me not only that she had an<br>inquiring mind which I mean one assumes<br>that history requires an inquiring mind<br>I think it does um but it also proved<br>and this is one of the reasons why I was<br>pleased to have Rachel come to the uh<br>Edo initially because I thought it would<br>mean that she would be able to write a<br>PhD thesis as well as scientific papers<br>without instruction in basic English<br>grammar which uh she proved that she<br>could do so Rachel I thought that you<br>were uh actually exceptionally well<br>qualified uh to become an academic for<br>an academic career and I would have to<br>say that your lecture tonight as well as<br>your career so far has proved that I was<br>absolutely right and I'm very proud of<br>myself for that reason so so thank you<br>for proving me right um I would just<br>like to say pick on a couple of things<br>that you mentioned tonight to just um<br>talk a little bit about them and I guess<br>really the first thing I wanted to say<br>is about your work in dietry sodum which<br>is terribly important and that is um I<br>think that you put the message across<br>tonight and I think most people here<br>would be be be aware that it is<br>generally accepted that restriction of<br>dietary sodium is one of the most<br>important Public Health measures to<br>reduce overall cardiovascular disease<br>risk and as everybody has heard tonight<br>your work especially your work in<br>measurement has made a profound<br>contribution to the body of knowledge<br>but not only the body of knowledge but<br>to the action that has resulted and has<br>countered that Dreadful stuff that you<br>showed us um of which you were a you<br>were this e one of the evil people who<br>misinformed the public but I think that<br>we have actually now got around that and<br>to no small measure you have contributed<br>so I want to thank you and congratulate<br>you for that and also I I just happen to<br>be a director of the national Heart<br>Foundation of New Zealand and I thank<br>you for the contribution that you've<br>made in New Zealand specifically because<br>a lot of the work in terms of guidelines<br>of this in this area have come through<br>the national heart foundation and I<br>thank you also for the service role that<br>you've taken in this National Heart<br>Foundation uh as a member of the<br>scientific committee and other<br>activities of the foundation I'm very<br>pleased you mentioned the heha program<br>um and I think there are a couple of<br>reasons why I'm pleased that you did so<br>uh first of all it is an indication how<br>broad your interests are in public<br>health and particularly um in the<br>nutritional aspect of public health I<br>think there is absolutely no doubt that<br>heha was potentially one of the most<br>important public health programs that<br>has been developed in this country but<br>also it is a depressing reminder of the<br>extent to which political ideology<br>rather than health science drives Public<br>Health agenda not just in this country<br>but internationally and it really<br>emphasizes the importance which people<br>like you researchers and practitioners<br>in public health have to continue to get<br>the message of the science of Public<br>Health across in the hope to counter<br>this effect of political ideology<br>and finally I and I particularly do this<br>on on behalf of Robin who asked me to<br>mention this but I would have done so<br>anyway I would like to acknowledge your<br>contribution to teaching uh I think the<br>um the award which you received for<br>research for teaching um in public<br>health uh is speaks for itself but I<br>think your role as a supervisor has been<br>outstanding and I'm sure that I don't<br>know how many of your research students<br>are here but I have the privilege of<br>knowing and being involved in the work<br>of many of them uh they would all want<br>me to say as has Robin asked to<br>acknowledge Your Excellence also as a<br>research supervisor you have been<br>brilliant in that<br>regard so really on behalf of all of us<br>congratulations thank you best wishes<br>may your professorial career continue in<br>the way it start in the way your career<br>has gone up to now and the way your<br>professorial career has started<br>I can't imagine what you're going to<br>achieve in the next few years but uh we<br>wish you our very best for for all that<br>you undertake thank you for your lecture<br>done to give you this small taper as a<br>reminder of this event tonight and what<br>you've done thank you<br>well thank you everyone I get the uh<br>final word for the night um I'm going to<br>thank Rachel for reminding me of my<br>undergraduate learning especially<br>homogenized food and the bomb ceromer um<br>but also a thank you uh for the labeling<br>work and the sodium guidelines because<br>there's a practicing dietition and<br>lecture that was really useful in<br>practice and and made a difference so um<br>it is great to come back around and see<br>that again um so the final words tonight<br>is to really welcome you to the staff<br>Club to join with Rachel and her Foo uh<br>to celebrate this wonderful success and<br>congratulate Professor Rachel
