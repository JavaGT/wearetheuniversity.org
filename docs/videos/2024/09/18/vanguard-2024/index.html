are<br>we going San Francisco San<br>Francisco so the aim of Vanguard is to<br>take a group of students from the<br>University of Orland traveling through<br>San Francisco and Silicon Valley to<br>inspire and motivate us to be curious um<br>and better understand Innovation and and<br>advanced ecosystem um and really distill<br>the learnings that we can take away bet<br>alter all today we're heading to Manila<br>Hotel to meet with Exton from lipm and<br>there hi guys so do you mind if you can<br>just tell me a few of the learnings that<br>you've had today after talking to our<br>two speakers yeah so one thing for me<br>today would have been uh the fact that<br>various different career paths can end<br>up in entrepreneurship and another one<br>would be the value of overseas<br>networking for example clients overseas<br>to access resources from overseas that<br>you wouldn't get in New Zealand nice<br>yeah Kun really showed us that you can<br>start with a big idea but with the right<br>execution you can also access a big<br>market and get acquired by big companies<br>which is of course a very inspiring<br>success story hey guys today we're<br>headed to orbert very excited to hear<br>from so many speakers yeah we've got<br>people from uh in stri and again all<br>birds so we're quite excited just to get<br>my biggest takeaway from today's session<br>was from Bethany Maples talk um I found<br>the prospect of combining education and<br>AI quite exciting and I think that's<br>where we're heading with the future so<br>the biggest lesson that I learned was<br>during the Tim Brown session about the<br>importance of social connectivity in a<br>market space good morning it's Vanguard<br>program oh right what are we doing today<br>so we're going to Mala town and we're<br>meeting up with K Founders who seted up<br>in the San Francisco area see there so<br>we're here with mink um what's one thing<br>you want to um share to aspiring<br>Founders in New Zealand um so I find<br>that most kiwis are too like too modest<br>um you should not be afraid to impose<br>yourself on others and ask people for<br>help and reach out cold uh to your<br>customers or investors or um employees<br>or<br>co-founders I think my biggest lesson<br>was um how they embraced being an<br>individual and bring uh putting their<br>best step forward and um putting<br>themselves out there as a person my<br>biggest takeaway was um being<br>comfortable enough to go backwards and<br>change the trajectory of your career and<br>how that can sometimes be a good<br>thing hey guys today is firstday in<br>Silicon belly and we are here at the Ben<br>of cap the plug and play tonight we're<br>visiting a UA alumni and creator of<br>Facebook Marketplace yeah um hi my name<br>is Gabrielle basuki and I think one<br>thing I love about working here is um<br>the people that I get to work with I<br>think meeting all these corporations and<br>stars everything is very inspiring for<br>my personal career uh my key learning<br>was the importance of having high<br>Ambitions and drinking really big and my<br>key takeaway from today was um that<br>investors look at two main things and<br>that is the team culture and um value<br>proposition hey where are we going<br>today we going to Amazon and then we'll<br>go to Stanford let's go<br>well at Amazon we learned that deep<br>domain expertise allows for the greatest<br>Innovation so I think New Zealand needs<br>to develop and play to his CH yeah and<br>after that we went to Stanford we<br>learned that the human being really has<br>to be at the center of AI Innovation and<br>that applies<br>globally hey re where are we going today<br>hey we're going to gole<br>gole thank you so<br>much the Giants game<br>today is the last day in San Francisco<br>later on we're meeting up with met and<br>Zia for both alumni of um<br>velocity as a team we learned so much<br>during this incredible week we would<br>like to give a huge thank you to all of<br>the speakers for their time and<br>hospitality and the vast range of<br>on behalf of the Vanguard crew we just<br>want to say thank you so much to De doel<br>and derella for making sure all of this<br>actually came together um it was a<br>fantastic trip and we just wanted to say<br>thank you all so much Y and thank you to<br>the rest of the cie team thank you so<br>much for backing us up and most<br>importantly thank you Tony for your<br>generosity and helping us enabling us<br>and supporting us through the whole trip<br>why do you fund this trip Tony well I<br>see that business education is the key<br>to economic prosperity and I know it's<br>only a small group but if we can get<br>more people seeing what happens in the<br>wide world uh we've got more chance of<br>uh entrepreneurs just growing our base<br>in this uh entrepreneur<br>ecosystem and so I've been interested in<br>uh in business education since set up a<br>business High School in 2001 and uh and<br>I see this as the best thing that I can<br>do uh to help support and so we've now<br>got this Vanguard program 10-year<br>program and uh taking 15 to 20 students<br>each year to Silicon Valley</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
