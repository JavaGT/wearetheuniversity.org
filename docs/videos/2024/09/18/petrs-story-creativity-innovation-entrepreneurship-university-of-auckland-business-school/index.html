The way I do things.<br>I grew up in Russia with my mother,<br>who is an architect and a designer,<br>my sister<br>and my father, who's a businessman.<br>Since, like, childhood,<br>I really wanted to make things.<br>That's why I was taking a lot of my toys apart.<br>To kind of find out<br>how they work.<br>My mum was not very fond of it.<br>Of course<br>I couldn't put it back together,<br>but knowing how it works actually kind of<br>helped me to end up where I am now.<br>Currently, I work at Unleash Space<br>at the University of Auckland<br>as a creative technologist, which enables<br>you to do so, so many things.<br>First and foremost,<br>we as creative technologists basically<br>help people to make their ideas come true.<br>And the way we do it, we utilize<br>a lot of technologies that we have<br>in the space, a lot of cool machinery<br>such as laser cutters, CNC’s, 3D printing,<br>and then you’re kind of problem solving,<br>to make their ideas come to life too.<br>Cracking that problem makes you feel<br>just like, “Yes! I’ve done it.”<br>Getting a lot of practical, experience<br>in that sense<br>allows you to be very intuitive<br>when you're trying to problem<br>solve your personal problem.<br>You'd be like, “Oh, I've done that before.”<br>So you're not starting from scratch.<br>That's very inspiring<br>place to be in, not just to make things,<br>but also to make good connections.<br>In business,<br>making connections<br>is the most important thing ever.<br>The more connections you have,<br>the more worldview you have. That allows<br>you to, seize interesting opportunities,<br>which you couldn't do otherwise.<br>And being in Unleash Space<br>surrounded by engineers,<br>you know, designers, and also Business<br>graduates, super exciting place to be.<br>The best place<br>to be in the university. Really.<br>We happen to have<br>a lot of startups that we've worked<br>with along the way during my major,<br>and to see all of these business aspects<br>that you have when you're creating things;<br>Who's your target audience?<br>What is the market for that thing?<br>How feasible or viable is your idea?<br>You see all of the stuff<br>needed to make something that people want.<br>In the future<br>I really want to start my own business<br>and to continue on the path of innovation<br>and creation.<br>So all of the work that I do in Unleash<br>helps me a lot to get a grasp<br>of these cool<br>new technologies<br>to see where we’re actually going with them.<br>All of that<br>I think I can kind of incorporate into<br>the future me when I'm building a startup<br>and I'm making<br>something cool and technical.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
