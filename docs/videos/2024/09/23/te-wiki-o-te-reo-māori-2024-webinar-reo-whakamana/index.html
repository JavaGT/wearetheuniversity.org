see that<br>everybody can hear me and<br>stuff um<br>yeah so my name is mcra I my current<br>role here at the head inaka is associate<br>de teacher education in teano or aai and<br>so just checking that you've joined um<br>some of you may have joined the session<br>before so I've shared it um a couple of<br>times and looking at different types of<br>uh so often we're part of we<br>and uh we a common practice to begin a<br>whoi is someone will take the<br>opportunity to share a kak here so that<br>everybody is settled and um as a<br>collective and on on the same K uh so<br>often um yeah it's important to<br>acknowledge somebody for taking on<br>often um daunting rle uh but what I will<br>do is um before we start is um practice<br>some pronunciation and we'll practice it<br>with the<br>consonant<br>t uh and what it sounds like what each<br>of our vow sounds in<br>the uh and then we'll CCE this aorded or<br>or sent structure<br>together uh<br>so um with when it is with the t is<br>with uh the consonant of the sound a<br>it's like a du so D so have a practice<br>on your own that D so D when it's with<br>the E it's also a D sound so<br>there uh when it's with the I it's a a<br>so it's at the front so we've got D like<br>a d was also like a a d and then with<br>so with the O It's a a d as well so do<br>and with the U it's a a two so we'll<br>that when um we practice this<br>with so with<br>pronunciation also when you get um to<br>vow sounds together it can be tricky so<br>with that Koo with that term Bo soy so<br>practicing the O and the air together<br>so<br>um meaning a name so insert your own<br>and so again with<br>that<br>D why and so why I've bracketed it is<br>that we can replace why which means<br>broadly<br>time um with other parts of the day that<br>we have an understanding of<br>so so we are in at the moment<br>um this day<br>afternoon okay so we'll go through the<br>use and so just reiterating what you<br>could replace W with<br>morning for the<br>afternoon for the evening<br>or for this<br>day uh and we'll practice<br>uh so with<br>the the the prefix k um at the beginning<br>of<br>kak uh it signifies a type of Mah uh we<br>understand Kai has lots of different<br>meanings Kai common for food uh but in<br>this case Kai the prefix indicates a<br>type of<br>mahak so the person who's undertaken the<br>kak other we would um hopefully know G<br>use uh for Teacher lecturer<br>uh um um someone who is supporting<br>similar<br>toak generally a broad term for a worker<br>so that might be new learning for some<br>of you so that<br>other so hopefully you'll have a look<br>around now or think about some theu that<br>you know<br>um similar so we'll just quickly recap<br>sentences<br>next okay uh often someone is has given<br>a speech or or recorded or uh and so um<br>again another way to acknowledge them so<br>will practice again<br>replacing uh<br>again so you can share these<br>um yeah you can share these in in<br>closing Mii as well as as uh in<br>person uh some other Mii to K or Mi to<br>um someone in general you want to thank<br>them uh in<br>general and this is a common phrase that<br>hopefully a lot of you have um seen uh<br>you uh if you're wanting to be more<br>direct and I use this more than I<br>would I would use Aku akum so my being<br>direct so akumi personalizing it more<br>direct uh and then my next slide is Art<br>note I want to go back um so questions<br>about well how do I um I could say I'll<br>here uh so if you're thanking someone<br>directly you know their name you could<br>say<br>then uh and I I'll remove the a so with<br>three syllables I'd<br>say if you had two syllable name um you<br>so or yeah one or two syllable names you<br>but with a name with my name three<br>syllables<br>then so I hope that makes makes sense<br>again hopefully some new learning for<br>some of<br>you<br>um oh so you could do the same with<br>helpful that's helpful for<br>you uh and so some examples of<br>uh giving<br>um or praise phrases is for<br>example uh this is a bit of a<br> I it on<br>my so you're great you're fantastic uh<br>and then expanding that to<br>S and broadly could be translated as<br>you're awesome and then if they're just<br>okay we'll practice those<br>say<br>so looking at that in front of names<br>with one or two syllables and here we<br>have a couple of uh phrases um from um<br>yeah from my twoo influence<br>so so<br>that so<br>literally um is clever<br>transliteration H H has lots of<br>different um<br>uh translations uh and in this case uh<br>so and I think I have couple<br>more uh so you might have seen these<br>phrases as well you can share them in<br>person or share them in um and print as<br>well uh<br>one<br>okay so we'll practice these without<br>remembering<br>que okay so that's what I have prepared<br>um for this morning so we've got um some<br>good time<br>to um ask any questions n oh difference<br>between n<br>n<br>no um some of us would have an<br>understanding<br>of uh the r in all<br>categories um and this case I don't see<br>yeah a difference on why you would<br>n same<br>same<br>c um yeah I hope that answers your<br>question B so now you can use use both n<br>is more<br>common uh so Emma's asking what's the<br>difference between a and F so so what I<br>shared with that<br>prefix um it's a type of of so the is<br>the<br>person is the<br>person is the the speech itself if that<br>makes sense so Kord the person who<br>um yeset there is um difference between<br>how people pronounce the the T sound um<br>and so for yeah me with my T and<br>influence it's the<br>that and so you can um recognize<br>definitely<br>someone from<br>or with<br>Su so and there's lots of other<br>different um uh common one um how the<br>the NG is pronounced so um those of you<br>who have an understanding of<br>our<br>um or so the NG is a<br>a and some people<br>um the reasons for that different<br>dialect is is often about the<br>environments that um yeah particular are<br>or were in and so with you know coming<br>from the south of very cold environment<br>so that C C Sound um and then that NG in<br>a suho dialect is like a n not<br>the so it's like instead of saying sing<br>a song it would be song so that NG is<br>quite as soft and pronounced as a an N<br>um and again that's to do well that's<br>one Theory um with the environment a<br>very um yeah sort of soft Bush<br>environment in in the<br>Mist<br>um so mighty regretful the modeling and<br>practice how much is it for sounds<br>of oh that's you um so asking about you<br>know model different dialects so just as<br>long as you're consistent in whatever<br>dialect that you you choose if that's<br>helpful um so people can recognize uh<br>maybe where you're from or where you've<br>learned your as well so yeah<br>consistency um yeah so really important<br>to<br>be yeah I think<br>honoring so often you being a school<br>teacher being in schools a lot and<br>that's often something that hurts my<br>helpful uh so asking about the um polite<br>I don't know I don't know what polite is<br>for you um but you choose you choose if<br>you want to acknowledge kah um you use<br>the the um<br>yeah oh right hi Katherine um yes I real<br>actually this is new learning for me and<br>this is something so Katherine's asking<br>about I realized they had it different<br>on two slides so<br>um I had uh what do I have<br>umak instead<br>ofak and so recently um some of you<br>would know Vinnie awesome reader and I<br>follow him um and has mind your tongue<br>um what would I say on the ground I<br>don't know anyway on social media and so<br>recently you know often we're saying<br>we're thinking about who when we're<br>saying we're saying in a paria way if<br>that or real real paria way I should say<br>and so thank you for<br>um but that you can use<br>e rather than using because literally<br>yeah you are translating into but<br>there's a whole other in itself so new<br>learning new recent learning for<br>me rather than which is still the same<br>thanking you for cheering the kak um<br>rather than<br>going for the Kaka if that makes sense K<br>oh and thank you for anous sh yeah lots<br>of resources on pronunciation um<br>online<br>um oh um Evelyn um the O<br>So and again when you it is tricky when<br>you have um the two vow sounds together<br>tricky commonly mispronounced as a how<br>which is also difficult to listen<br>toia<br>a anyway um because yeah a doesn't mean<br>anything<br>uh Pap thank you for<br>asking<br>um and another dialect<br>so um again depending on being<br>consistent with your own own dialect<br>um is what I would say and then if you<br>are from you know have tanaki or<br>um f dialect it would be W so dropping<br>that<br>h f<br>W so yeah if that that's<br>helpful uh for you so yeah think you<br>acknowledging the dialect um but also<br>being consistent with with your<br>own uh yeah so same again CER Rachel um<br>yeah acknowledging um their their<br>dialect and the when you are um visiting<br>I think would be um appropriate h<br>goby I let this conversation's around<br>questions so<br>Mana um here well you have a range<br>right uh so you<br>so um so you recognize that don't don't<br>so if that's helpful for you I<br>B I'll stay on the line for a little bit<br>longer um but thank you thank you for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
