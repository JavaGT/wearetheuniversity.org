an<br>incantation or ritual chant set of form<br>of words to state or make it effective<br>an an<br>activity um it's recited using<br>traditional language symbols and<br>structures um and today I wanted to<br>focus on um the kakia that we're using<br>here at DEA or a couple of the more<br>common kak and just make some comments<br>on that so<br>uh so following the custom uh that's<br>usual for mildy Gatherings or on<br>K that are important then we start with<br>Kaka and this little Kaka as a as a<br>so um so at the<br>hinga uh we're most<br>likely uh to encounter kakia uh in M<br>ceremony and<br>ritual uh and so some of those things<br>might be like Po Fetti and Tangi and um<br>Other M events um<br>within<br>um meetings often there's the beginning<br>and closing kakia so for academic board<br>for um faculty The Faculty board um we<br>are using uh kakia um sometimes people<br>will see it before food is<br>eaten um there'll be Kaka at graduation<br>openings of buildings closings of<br>buildings giftings of Tong there's k for<br>all kinds of different um spaces that uh<br>people will will um run into k<br>uh and I guess one of<br>the<br>um<br>the the ideas around it or the the<br>likelihood of it occurring is that the<br>more important the occasion then the the<br>the more likely there is to be kak here<br>um so<br>why um I think first of all there's a<br>belief in a spiritual belief or a<br>perspective that there's a a greater<br>force operating in the world and um and<br>you know I'm talking from a mildy<br>perspective um and there's an acceptance<br>of not being entirely in control of<br>everything that sort of happens and so<br>that limitation and that not<br>knowing um is a is a part of that um but<br>also is a um an understanding of the<br>universality of our humanity and the the<br>way we are as people and um with that<br>um is this idea that um you know there<br>are some things that we share across um<br>Nations and people because people are<br>just people and we have our own um UPS<br>and downs in life and so it's an<br>acceptance of that and um you know the<br>the Frailty of our<br>Humanity um the there is some Reliance<br>on the collected knowledge of our<br>ancestors and um some of that is tested<br>on um in the Val Val uh validity of<br>those<br>practices yes good and in the complexity<br>of our relationships with people and our<br>work and the you know observation of the<br>of the Wonders and the power of the<br>Natural Earth and so um what I mean by<br>that is um that uh we are able to to<br>draw on the knowledge of those people<br>who have thought deeply about what it is<br>to exist as a as a people and they have<br>provided<br>um ideas and ways of<br>living uh that in the end I think the<br>the goal of that was to ensure that we<br>live good lives and so kakia is a part<br>of that I think kakia can't be<br>um um sort of separated out from the<br>entire value system and so ideas around<br>tapu uh in terms of there are<br>restrictions in some areas of our life<br>and um you know an example of that might<br>be um when there's a a tragedy within a<br>family um some of those restrictions<br>might be like um you know being aware of<br>how other people might be feeling in<br>that space and so there might be a<br>restriction uh around the way that you<br>might behave uh there's the idea of Noah<br>and those spaces that we we can't live<br>with<br>tapu within our whole lives that we have<br>to have no spaces where uh we can uh<br>just continue with with living life and<br>um there's Mana there's a recognition of<br>authority in our space there are acts<br>OFA and acting with generosity and care<br>with each other<br>this idea of being unified and<br>supporting one another um having some<br>empathy for each other and there's a<br>whole range of values that go along<br>those lines um and you know to go back<br>to the idea again that the<br>more Mana or the importance in the<br>occasion then the more likely there will<br>be Associated tapu or restrictions in<br>that area and the need for kakia to<br>provide some guidance um in the way that<br>we might proceed and at the end of that<br>event uh then kakia signals a return to<br>nor the lifting of the um restrictions<br>and so that people can just operate in<br>everyday um in everyday life and my<br>understanding of tapu and no neither of<br>them are um better or worse than the<br>other they all they do is Mark<br>times and spaces to allow us to um act<br>in appropriate<br>ways um so maybe we can talk about that<br>a little bit more just some notes on on<br>kakia and these are sort of done just in<br>observing and listening and reading<br>around these ideas um sometimes there<br>are<br>instructional um parts of K here and so<br>you know refer back to the um to our<br>starting C kak here this idea of Modi to<br>and uh Modi has its own meaning around<br>um the essence of life and I um was<br>reading something recently that talked<br>about that the Modi of say like a river<br>um the water might be flowing in the<br>river but if there's no life in it the<br>actual life inside of it is the Modi of<br>it and so this idea of engaging the<br>spirit or the translation is says Mo<br>Modi to engage the spirit it means um<br>you know that uh we would engage those<br>parts of us that sort of bring um the<br>things that were involved in to life and<br>so engaging the when the sort of cut the<br>intention of the the kakia the intention<br>of these words is to say well um perhaps<br>the issues that we're going to be<br>discussing need us to engage as people<br>to bring those things to life um<br>sometimes they're<br>aspirational and so you know often you<br>said and so being in um United in<br>purpose uh so they sort of<br>Express um yeah aspiration<br>that uh when we enter into some things<br>that we it doesn't mean that we'll all<br>be in agreement with each other about um<br>what the things we're going to discuss<br>but we're the intention is that we're<br>here to discuss to find the right way<br>forward for us so uh ideas of expressing<br>expressing um what we want to see happen<br>are often uh a part of the C here um<br>this idea of binding um and I've taken<br>this out of the the sort of closing here<br>this<br>idea restrictions are moved aside so<br>that idea of um uh often at the end of a<br>meeting and so some things um may not<br>have been decided necessarily in that<br>space maybe there are um a sense of um<br>people being unsettled or um there have<br>been arguments that have happened<br>happened in that space and um this idea<br>of um sort of binding those things and<br>leaving them in a particular place uh so<br>if the if tapu has been awakened uh then<br>it might be uh it would seem sensible<br>and and mildy thinking to sort of say<br>well we've discussed those things we<br>feel different about them but now let's<br>leave them in one space and we can<br>continue with our relationship in other<br>in other spaces and so that idea of<br>maybe<br>binding uh and keeping um those things<br>in the in their rightful place is is<br>that idea and then um and then the<br>second part of that is sometimes it's<br>about releasing people to move on to<br>second to return to everyday activi so<br>allowing people to move from one space<br>to another and then um just some sort of<br>notes that sometimes there's this<br>rhythmic<br>um part of kakia uh that um and I don't<br>know whether it's just for for mildy<br>people who who think it's rhythmic but<br>anyway to me it's rhythmic and often<br>that's seen in some of the repetition<br>and so the the starting kakia has this<br>Modi Modi too and that particular kak<br>here comes from a wider use of those<br>sorts of ideas we go Modi 2 Modi order<br>Modi mod you know all of these sorts of<br>things um and so there's a rhythm inside<br>often inside um<br>kakia uh and often that's those ideas of<br>the repetition but the repetition can<br>also mean an expansion of the single<br>idea within within Modi uh um the second<br>part is this or another part of it is<br>that there's of often there's this<br>dualism<br>inside<br>know um you know the sky father the<br>Earth Mother um the you know the sun<br>rises the moon comes out you know the<br>the night and the day the all of these<br>sort of dual ideas and um I think my<br>understanding of that is um because it's<br>uh trying to find um the balance between<br>those two um those<br>parts um and then the next point of it<br>is this sort of um<br>multi-dimensional relative to time and<br>space and so um the idea of the matariki<br>celebration and often that uh also<br>contains you know it's around<br>Kaka uh they have a you know but kakia<br>as an important part of that day and<br>it's because of that particular time of<br>year<br>and um and the weather patterns it's not<br>just the the Stars it's What's Happening<br>Here on the earth um what needs to be<br>done going forward and so we have this<br>dualism that's happening but it's also<br>relative to the particular time and<br>place and the<br>people that are are present at this at<br>that time so again you know these are<br>markers that were set in place hundreds<br>of years ago and are useful for us to<br>understand um what's happening in our<br>space um kakia there are ancient ideas<br>and like those ideas around<br>matariki um tapu and Noah but there're<br>also modern ideas and um I think my<br>perspective on kakia is that it's um<br>it's useful for today it's built on<br>wisdom of the past and um and we try to<br>make it relevant um for where things are<br>at for us today and in part that's my<br>idea around validating whether those kak<br>here have um are useful for us today and<br>and I think that our<br>ancestors um had the idea that these<br>things were learned but we are<br>continuing to learn and so if we<br>continue to to to learn in these areas<br>then we're continuing to evolve and<br>develop kakia going forward uh and why<br>would we do that because it's good for<br>us my thoughts um so how does it<br>work uh you know it's a method um to<br>recognize and deal with the daily and<br>extraordinary moments in life um and<br>so um recognizing the value of our<br>colleagues recognizing the importance of<br>um some of the issues that we're dealing<br>with uh you know those can be done uh<br>when we make aspirational statements<br>about ah are we in in this together are<br>we looking for the uh you know for<br>benefits for our students for our<br>community all of those sorts of things<br>can be restated and C here um and then<br>the extraordinary moments in life uh you<br>know those major traumas or major um Joy<br>uh you know the whole um whole emotional<br>journey of Just Just Being Human um I<br>think um it's useful for us paing and<br>speaking and listening to Shared values<br>again going back to that there might be<br>instructions uh you know there are<br>particular kak here um that I always<br>think about I'm a I enjoy<br>diving and but I also realize that you<br>know if I don't understand the context<br>I'm going into um as a diver you know<br>you could be here and 3 minutes later<br>you could be gone um and so there are<br>some instructions maybe there are<br>cautions there are Inspirations and it<br>helps us move from one space to another<br>so again um if you're diving you know<br>one minute you're on the land this is a<br>whole different world when you're in the<br>ocean and so understanding what's<br>happening in your space is important I<br>think there's a cultural imperative um<br>this is something that's been passed<br>down um for Generations that our people<br>have said this is useful for you you<br>should do this um and an acceptance of<br>other beliefs and so um you know if<br>you've been to mildy events if you would<br>have got seen the um the king's uh<br>funeral the other week and had<br>ministers all lined up from all kinds of<br>different Faith Traditions um these an<br>acceptance of people Express and<br>understand these things differently um I<br>don't personally think um you know mildy<br>spirituality is any better or any worse<br>than anyone else it's just um the way<br>that<br>we um we think is is appropriate to to<br>act um I don't reckon it's a a moral or<br>ethical position and um a lot of the<br>kakia being used in uh or the kakia that<br>we use here at the University doesn't<br>have a an attachment to um a particular<br>Faith although it can you know people uh<br>can express their their faith positions<br>and that's fine um but we you know<br>myself I understand that people might<br>feel um not particularly attached to<br>Christianity or being Muslim or and and<br>not wanting to be offensive but sort of<br>so often the kakia we're using uh are<br>think things that are non denominational<br>or don't people don't feel like they<br>have to lock themselves into a<br>particular thing um kak can be used by<br>everyone and um you know and now and<br>amongst mildy people children are taught<br>kakia and everyone learns kakia for all<br>kinds of different things<br>um uh yeah so it's available for<br>everyone and then um but there are<br>some uh places and spaces that perhaps<br>um take more thought and so when mana<br>and tapu levels rise uh people should be<br>careful and for some occasion should you<br>should leave it to the to the experts<br>and um you know I was thinking about um<br>you know there are some mental health<br>issues and you know there are some<br>beliefs that well you know there are<br>um spiritual uh things attached to those<br>ideas uh but also um and there might be<br>kak here as a part of their healing<br>process but there's also room for<br>experts to be involved in that space and<br>so uh you know they<br>were sort of reminded of that tragedy<br>that was a few years ago when they were<br>doing Kia and ended up um you know<br>somebody was hurt because of the process<br>and so um yeah if there's as the Mano<br>and tapu Rises you know be careful about<br>what what you're doing in that space<br>so anyway there's a few thoughts um<br>thought we'd open it up and if you have<br>any general questions<br>then um this first question uh as a nonm<br>I feel happy to participate in kak and<br>other ritual for TI however I feel<br>uncomfortable leading kak I don't feel I<br>have the Mana unless people unless Manu<br>have specifically told me it's okay for<br>that particular occasion can you please<br>provide some ideas on nonm leading K<br>here and if that might differ in<br>different situations yes it differs in<br>different situations<br>um uh like I say you know if it's a tick<br>box box exercise that's different from<br>from the the idea that<br>um that oh you know from a Tik side that<br>these are one of the the things that we<br>should do and um in my mind again um I<br>you know if it's done in English or if<br>it's done um under a Muslim umbrella<br>then it's still ticks the boxes for me<br>but uh you know that whole um you know<br>feeling comtable in mildy spaces and<br>those sorts of things often yeah I I<br>agree with you to say that if somebody<br>if the somebody ask asks you to do Kia<br>uh then uh it's on in part it's on them<br>for um and under their money that you<br>might be asked to do that and you go for<br>it so um yeah I don't have a problem I<br>don't have a problem with<br>it uh<br>second<br>one um I have I've heard that if you<br>open a event with you must close with<br>one and if you didn't open with kak you<br>shouldn't close with one is this t a<br>different between around the mot is it<br>yeah that's generally the rule uh that<br>you open something up and then you<br>should close it um but um kakia is not<br>just sort of defined on those sorts of<br>rules you know I've been in huie where<br>um kakia is a tool to help sort of move<br>us through some things and so if you're<br>halfway through something and and<br>something um big comes up and you think<br>oh let's have kak here and to sort of uh<br>cap what has been released in that space<br>then um you know that can be that can be<br>a useful thing so um but generally the<br>you open in kakia and you close in kakia<br>and usually it's the same person that's<br>that's what usually happens another<br>question uh what's the function in<br>Rhythm and tone when carrying kak is it<br>mainly to engage people in the<br>cop just sounds better<br>um yeah I think um there are I can't<br>remember is it mum monic where sometimes<br>it's easier to um to remember kakia and<br>set kakia so having the Rhythm can be<br>helpful um some people talk about the<br>tone um that um there's a sort of raised<br>space um the way that people do kak here<br>and that's sort of more in touch with<br>the w side but um I don't personally<br>ascribe to that because I think um if<br>the intentions uh and speaking out those<br>words are the are the more important<br>part uh so um but you know that's my<br>opinion and other people have um have<br>their thoughts it does sound better to<br>mild ears you know to have the flow and<br>um uh and the assurity and the<br>confidence that sort of comes with that<br>flow and so if somebody's stuttering<br>through something maybe there's you know<br>that sort of feeling so um but you know<br>I've heard beautiful kakia being done in<br>a halted way because of the<br>um because it was just so right for that<br>occasion and and the person that was<br>doing it you know was fully engaged and<br>understood what the COA was and yeah so<br>I I um yeah that's my f another one<br>um uh how much does correct pronun<br>pronunciation matter when using some of<br>our more traditional<br>kakia<br>um yeah correct correct pronunciation is<br>is very<br>important um and uh to be understood and<br>um something about speaking out<br>kakia um sort of claims spaces and so<br>when we when we kakia<br>together um we make joint statements<br>about maybe the way that we might behave<br>and the way that we might do things and<br>so yeah pronunciation is is uh very<br>important<br>um but um there are like I say you know<br>the kids are learning Kaka and they'll<br>get them upside down and back to front<br>and all the rest of it um and so there<br>are levels of kakia and so I would say<br>yeah just keep on doing it keep on using<br>kakia and in the classes that I teach I<br>often try to compose kakia to um to be<br>relevant for the class and for the time<br>that we're together and um it's a it's a<br>really good learning um language<br>exercise because you'll hear rhythms you<br>know mildy rhythms of language you'll<br>hear um you know you might pick up words<br>you'll memorize um lines of words that<br>are hopefully grammatically correct and<br>and all of that sort of all so there's<br>heaps of good learning inside of that<br>and I think for some of us um who you<br>know have a more a bent towards those<br>things learning Kaka can be a a really<br>good um way to learn the<br>language and the values inside of uh in<br>in those<br>practices um one other question you have<br>recommendations for where one can find<br>kak here for specific<br>purposes<br>um yes<br>um and using<br>Tu for every who is getting very shy no<br>matter how good it is for a group of<br>people come together yeah um there are<br>um there are you know literally<br>thousands of of K here um<br>and but I'm not quite they they're sort<br>of scattered all over the place and um<br>at the if you watched anything of the<br>Tangy for the king a lot of the speakers<br>would use kakia in um in their<br>introductions for their speeches and so<br>there's you know those sorts of places<br>where they're using it and in time for<br>their from their people in the context<br>of the king is you know we all all very<br>interesting um yeah I'm not<br>sure they're all over the place if you<br>look you'll hopefully find some<br>sorry uh and then um Andrew K any<br>guidance when kak care is appropriate or<br>not um how important does an event need<br>to be yeah it's<br>um um you know the whole thing around<br>eating food is is<br>is so relaxed today it it's it's a<br>different time from when our ancestors<br>if you if you you know got fish for the<br>day you're just overwhelmed and you know<br>and so the importance of feeding people<br>was much more important than you know<br>being down pack and save she we have a<br>kutak here before we go in you know that<br>sort of stuff but you know if you were<br>fishing uh to survive then you<br>definitely want to do a kutak oh got to<br>try everything my new bait my new hook<br>and a kakia to try to make this thing<br>work so um you know how important is the<br>event um often we know that because you<br>know there are it might be you know<br>really emotionally charged uh period of<br>that things being discussed it might be<br>um you know huge decisions that will<br>impact people's lives uh employment or<br>unemployment um you know changes within<br>organiz you know all of those sorts of<br>things are important times but um yeah<br>knowing what the right K is oh that's<br>another another<br>thing<br>um and then the last question when asked<br>to do kak no one takes the opportunity<br>what's the best way to what is the best<br>to do is not to offend anyone can I do<br>it in my own homeand language read kak<br>or rather have no<br>kak um yeah you could do all all three<br>of those if um you know like I say if<br>the event is uh an important one uh then<br>you might want to have people pause and<br>and you know and sometimes go oh we're<br>just going to be 30 seconds just have<br>some silence and people to think of<br>contemplate about where where we're<br>about to go um you could do it in your<br>own language um you could read aaka you<br>know I don't think um as we're learning<br>these things I don't think there's wrong<br>or right answer in there but um you know<br>but if the meeting's about the<br>photocopier then maybe you know maybe<br>you don't need a cutor care for that one<br>helpful oh I just Clos on this cut here<br>actually<br>sorry um<br>and we don't want to break kak here I<br>mean break<br>our our um our TI</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
