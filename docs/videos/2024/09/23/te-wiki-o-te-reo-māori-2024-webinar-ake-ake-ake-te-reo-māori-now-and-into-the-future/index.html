um I was just thinking about<br>um some of the things that might be<br>going through people's minds at the<br>so you know I was just thinking about<br>some things that um that we might be<br>feeling um as well as uh the welcoming<br>no to so thinking about um you know we<br>Queen so those were some of the things<br>that were on my mind when I was kind of<br>thinking about um this cord it for today<br>uh we're also in the process of change<br>um you know thinking about um<br>revitalization where we've come from um<br>and I think this must be the 52nd year<br>if I can count correctly um since the<br>petition to Parliament for um for tedar<br>you know um so we started off with um<br>tedel Mal day which then shifted into TI<br>maldi which is where we're at now um we<br>also have mahu maldi so you know<br>thinking about the whole month of mudu<br>which is September um and so if we're<br>thinking about the the the changes that<br>are occurring in um in our society<br>regarding tidel Mali um we are in a<br>space of constant resistance so we're<br>seeing all of this beauty coming through<br>in um t m use in a lot of different<br>spaces um and you know we we are also<br>needing to acknowledge that we do have<br>structures in place um that are seeking<br>to undermine<br>man um as Tanga so you know you would<br>have seen if you um if you look on the<br>news or if you you know if you're aware<br>of what's Happening um politically you<br>know we have the incoming treaty<br>principles Bill we've had a whole Stream<br>So got lots of dot dot dot dots there<br>about um the ways in which we are<br>needing to be constantly on high alert<br>about what's happening in our government<br>today so um while it's great to be<br>celebrating tidel Mari we are also very<br>politically aware about um the context<br>in which tidel Mari revitalization is<br>happening um so some of the main points<br>that I'll be trying to cover today um<br>you know I do have quite a few slides<br>but we don't have much time so I'll try<br>and um get through as much as possible<br>so if we can understand the historical<br>context in which we are operating in and<br>we're trying to revitalize Tel Maran<br>that can help us at an individual level<br>as well as at a collective level at a<br>societal level as well um also thinking<br>about some actionable steps that we can<br>take towards our own Almighty futures um<br>and thinking about what's required at a<br>higher level that Collective level again<br>um and so I often kind of refer toi<br>yongo um who was a friend of U my<br>grandfathers and wuku my grandmother<br>um sorry I'm I'm not Kenyan just um<br>I better explain that so um yeah anyway<br>so so my um my grandfather's wife is<br>Kenyan um and so they they were friends<br>with um inoi so um this particular quote<br>just reminds me of the fact that t Mar<br>revitalization is happening also within<br>the global context of language analiz<br>Annihilation um<br>towards um towards kind of<br>in these political agendas so language<br>this is the quote from language carries<br>culture and culture culture carries uh<br>particularly through oral orature and<br>literature the entire body of values by<br>which we come to perceive ourselves and<br>our um in our place in the world so um<br>yeah if we just think about that for a<br>minute so you know the domination of a<br>people's Language by the languages of<br>the colonizing Nations was crucial in<br>the Domin of the mental universe of the<br>colonized so um thinking about language<br>revitalization as a political act as<br>well and so you know we can think about<br>um this<br>year's and while um<br>the heaven attributed this to um you<br>know the the new release of konu<br>um uh you know we we can see that the<br>words are constant used in in political<br>ways um so yeah it's important that we<br>don't our kind of desire for<br>Unity in ways that that aren't actually<br>help addressing some of the challenges<br>that we're trying to deal with<br>collectively at a societal level so um<br>think about some of the the historical<br>trauma there's a lot of historical<br>trauma narratives happening at the<br>moment um and so Harman and gone they<br>took about um these four kind of<br>principles or ways<br>of understanding historical trauma so<br>firstly we have a colonial in injury um<br>to indigenous peoples um and that's at<br>you know that's that's a consequence of<br>this idea um towards conquest or<br>subjugation um this experience is a<br>collective experience so a collective<br>experience amongst indigenous peoples um<br>the these experiences of collective<br>injury have cumulative effects so that<br>means that we have um they<br>are yeah they can kind of come at a<br>cellular level so we have a snowball<br>trickle down effect so even though the<br>the initial injury may have looked a<br>particular way um the cumulative effects<br>of that injury might look quite<br>different so and then we get into this<br>idea of inter intergenerational<br>transmission<br>so um yeah if we think about the idea<br>that you know the taking of political<br>Authority land and language<br>were Tools in achieving the colonial<br>agenda of of assimilation um so if we're<br>thinking about how we might revitalizer<br>language um it's also really important<br>that we acknowledge our<br>history um and so you know we have<br>people who help us to remind us about<br>our history um so T has you know spent<br>his life um helping us as a society to<br>remember um some of these Colonial<br>injuries so that I will not speak Mai um<br>exhibition that um that he put on in<br>2020 for the 50th anniversary of um you<br>know the petition to um the real Mar<br>petition um but we all have our own we<br>all have our own corded or we all have<br>our own experiences of what<br>colonization um has has Meant For Us and<br>how these experiences have had a trickle<br>um you know as well<br>as all of these people who are artists<br>and help us think about um solving<br>problems in really creative ways and um<br>helping to raise our<br>Consciousness so one of the things that<br>um so this is our baby who is<br>the um the Y 262 report we see that you<br>know the government had continued to<br>play a role in the decline of Ted maldi<br>so um this little line the scattered<br>kind of line here um that it shows the<br>direction in which Tel Mii enrollments<br>sorry kadil enrollments would have taken<br>had had there been adequate funding and<br>support for Kung so this idea that um<br>that Grassroots movements can um can<br>operate an isolation from the crown um<br>you know that's that's perhaps not not<br>correct because you know Crown the crown<br>still has the ability to impose policies<br>and regulations and um and uh you know<br>and and an inadequately fund kind of um<br>these initiatives as well so we do need<br>the crown to be on board with tal maldi<br>revitalization so basically our<br>histories we're all impacted by our<br>histories whether you're maldi or Paka<br>you will be impacted by our histories in<br>um ala so what this all comes down to<br>for language anxiety so what I'm<br>interested in is how do we actually<br>produce language and some of the factors<br>that help us to think about how we<br>produce<br>language you know there's both an<br>individual level kind of series of<br>factors that are going on as well as the<br>the collective um but for us to know<br>just generally you know public Fe Public<br>Speaking is you know ranked a number one<br>fear so people um people rank you know<br>public speaking as as more anxiety<br>provoking than um the idea of dying so<br>you know we know that there's a major<br>anxiety that happens when people attempt<br>to use a language that is their second<br>language or a language that they're not<br>familiar with and this is exacerbated<br>when it's a language that you have a<br> puer connection to and you don't<br>want to get it wrong um so understanding<br>our triggers both um you know and we<br>will both have different uh reasons for<br>why we might be experiencing anxiety and<br>so once we understand um our triggers we<br>can also start to understand the<br>attributions that we make so these are<br>the stories that we tell ourselves about<br>why we might be um good um or or not so<br>good at um at a particular task and<br>that's not just um not just language<br>learning so if we focus on um you know<br>identity as a rationale um behind why we<br>might be motivated as as M or you know<br>if you're a Tong of um<br>you know wanting to be a full citizen of<br>V these are some of the the motivations<br>that we s through for why a person might<br>want to learn to elmy however that<br>raises the stake so if you have a um an<br>identity based investment in the<br>language what happens when you inevit<br>inevitably make mistakes in the language<br>that you um have you know kind of put up<br>on this pedestal is that you end up<br>feeling you know quite um nervous about<br>making a mistake and and the reasons<br>that you give yourself for making that<br>mistake um can be detrimental to your<br>learning so anxiety language anxiety is<br>one of the you know most well kind of<br>researched topics in second language um<br>acquisition Theory so um you know we<br>know that<br>from right from the Geto through to<br>Output anxiety can impact on how we<br>Attain and produce to Del M so how we<br>learn new vocab how we learn syntax um<br>who we we are yeah who we learning that<br>from um the encoding process from<br>short-term to long-term memory so um<br>anxiety can impact or disrupt that<br>process from shifting um you know Koo or<br>new vocab from the shortterm to the<br>longterm memory it can also impact on<br>the pace at which we can recall the<br>information that we're trying to recall<br>so obviously when you're having a<br>conversation with somebody in t m you<br>want to be able to recall the words that<br>you are saying in um in as quick as po<br>as quickly as possible sorry um and so<br>if you're experiencing high levels of<br>anxiety um that can really you know<br>impact on the time that it takes to rec<br>that information or whether you can<br>actually recall it at all at that<br>particular time so some of the ways in<br>which fear impacts on um sorry which<br>fakar can impact on Ted acquisition and<br>use um is based on thinking about<br>um of belonging so when we feel like our<br>sense of belonging is at risk um we<br>start to have a fear response um you<br>know this is our sense of security um<br>our connections might be disrupted if we<br>feel like our sense of belonging um is<br>highly connected with action so the<br>action being um your ability to use<br>tidel mildi so um yeah good things for<br>language don't really come when people<br>are experiencing high levels of fear in<br>those language um acquisition or<br>production<br>phases so um one of the questions that<br>we asked so this is specific to um mildy<br>who are learning to mildy um we asked um<br>participants in a study the Manu study<br>which you can find on<br>the my website um if I make a mistake<br>using theal moldi I feel like it'll<br>impact how M others think I am I compare<br>myself to Other M speakers I feel like<br>I'm expected to know to deal moldi<br>because I identify as moldi so the more<br>that participants agreed with these<br>statements the more that they um<br>indicated that they experienced uh uh<br>language<br>anxiety so on another set of scales so<br>expectations are really high high um so<br>if you look at these this graph here um<br>so those in the dark blue are the high<br>proficiency group with those in the<br>light blue being the low proficiency<br>group and so this question here I'm<br>expected to know to De M because I<br>identify as M what you can see here is<br>that those in the low proficiency group<br>we're more likely to agree with that<br>particular statement and so how we might<br>interpret that result is that the<br>expectations that M who are competent<br>user users of t m of themselves aren't<br>perhaps tied as as closely to their<br>identity um and that and and in<br>comparison you know we we um need to<br>have UT half for those who are Learners<br>of tal because the expectations that<br>they have of themselves are really high<br>um and so if we think about identity in<br>um the colonial context so this is a<br>quote from um Mo<br>Jackson um and um he talks about this<br>idea that the colonizers Enthusiast<br>enthusiastically imported the idea here<br>with definitions such as a real mildy<br>only being someone with more than 3/4<br>native blood they divided us according<br>to this Blood Quantum and if<br>you and and if in that definition you<br>had less than 3/4s then for example you<br>could not have interest in native land<br>by redefining us according to a<br>scientific untruth they effectively<br>removed thousands of acres of land from<br>our people and thus began over A Century<br>of defining and redefining who we are as<br>a people um between 1841 and 1990 there<br>were in fact 33 blood definitions of who<br>a Mali<br>is some said you a Mali if you had a<br>certain degree of mildi blood and lived<br>as a native others said you could not be<br>a Mali if you had a mildy mother and a<br>Paka father because obviously the Paka<br>man's blood was quantifiably worth more<br>than the mighty woman's blood and so you<br>miraculously became Paka in my view the<br>imposition of that whole discourse is<br>one of the most damaging things that has<br>been done to our people because it has<br>altered the very notion of our identity<br>and worth and so here you can see the<br>direct connection between<br>um land the courts our identity and this<br>quation of<br>identities um and so so if we go back to<br>the results here so those with the with<br>the light blue being um having lower<br>proficiency than those with the dark<br>blue um what we can see in this question<br>here if I make a mistake using tid I<br>feel like it will impact on how mildy<br>others think that I am and so um making<br>mistakes is inevitable when we're going<br>through language acquisition processes<br>and so for those that are exper um on<br>the low proficiency sort of end of the<br>scale<br>um uh if we assume that we our mistakes<br>are attributed to a trait that we have<br>um this this is not not good so I could<br>say more about this but I see I've got<br>one minute left<br>so so what might we do to address some<br>of these challenges so we can identify<br>our own advantage and<br>disadvantages um and for those who are<br>struggling with anxiety uh we can start<br>to help make the unconscious conscious<br>so what are some of our conscious<br>beliefs that we hold about ourselves as<br>Learners or users of tedel maldi um and<br>how we might we reclaim oura over our<br>own emotional experiences um being very<br>conscious about our labeling how we<br>label ourselves how we label others um<br>so these ideas of lazzy or uncommitted<br>um these can have really negative<br>impacts on Learners um and if we kind of<br>unhinge this idea of of identity from<br>haa so making a mistake doesn't make you<br>a bad mildy it makes you a learner of t<br>m um so you know just shifting the ways<br>in which we kind of talk about our<br>narratives around um how we learn to M<br>so some vehicles for for coping with<br>intergenerational trauma as well as<br>understanding how we might learn our<br>language as our as an ancestral language<br>Learners so this idea of um TOA you know<br>breathing exercises finding peace in the<br>self um sematic exercises so Mahi<br>working through places in the body that<br>are holding stress um finding wayss to<br>tuso to release um these really<br>challenging emotions at a so those are<br>all independent activities at a<br>collective level um we can think about<br>you know our Fano our<br>copano um how we how we get our our our<br>um our people uh to to support us in<br>this particular challenging time U or<br>Journey um also<br>remembering what's the reason what's the<br>rationale behind why you've um decided<br>to go to enter into this journey as well<br>as finding a tiu at sorry these um words<br>have kind<br>of haven't worked probably um so I won't<br>go through all of these but um yeah<br>there's lots of independent coping<br>strategies that we can work out so<br>identifying our personal triggers and<br>delling the intensity so we can still<br>get triggered you know by particular<br>things on and on and on but what our<br>goal is is to try and dull the intensity<br>of that extreme emotion um we're trying<br>to promote<br>engagement with real M learning<br>activities and use activities rather<br>than withdrawing or avoiding um personal<br>interactions where tidel Mari um is used<br>so um yeah there's lots here and I won't<br>have time so there's lots of collective<br>benefits to Healing so if we think about<br>you know um<br>oopsy um if we think about the the root<br>cause for internal disharmony or<br>disregulation that can happen when we<br>are I'm learning Tel maldi um we might<br>use our connections um and our<br>Collective Strength to try and address<br>some of these things so I'm just going<br>to stop um May yeah oh my gosh it's got<br>so much okay I'll stop here any<br>particular party thanks thanks for the<br>um it what a good good online resources<br>for Learners so there's lots depends on<br>which level you're at um<br>so um obviously my absolute go-to is<br>teaka online the online dictionary um<br>and actually within the teaka online<br>dictionary you can see there's lots of<br>um interactive activities on that um but<br>actually just a Google search you can<br>have a look at you know there are so<br>many resources which is actually kind of<br>some of the challenge um and some people<br>have actually done kind of like a a<br>go-to list of what those resources are<br>um yeah so uh what are some good<br>resources to practice sentence<br>structure um yeah I mean you can always<br>go it depends on who you're talking with<br>so the m and the home M at home book is<br>great um it gives you four sentences<br>that you can just literally give them<br>out um hey Kelly's book um so so it's<br>got like kiaha there's another book with<br>okay so many Learners of T will be<br>English speakers both M and P how do we<br>ensure that tidel stays truly tidel and<br>doesn't change rapidly into English<br>Direction so um yeah so that that um<br>there has<br>been it's got like an acronym um like a<br>Enz somebody on here might actually know<br>um what that study was um but Janette<br>King and and her colleagues have um<br>uh yeah they have been doing lots of<br>work in in that area to look at language<br>change um I think even maybe um yeah I I<br>can't give you a straight answer without<br>actually looking it up but um there<br>there is language change and so I think<br>for us it's just working out which bits<br>of language change are you know<br>potentially dangerous or you know and<br>which which bits of language change are<br>inevitable so um and what what I mean by<br>dangerous is you know if we start to<br>um I'm actually just going to leave that<br>because I could go down a whole rivit<br>hole but yeah kby I'll carry on<br>um what impact do you think the<br>workplace has on language Revival oh<br>that's a great question so um I actually<br>have a different um set of slides for<br>that but um language in the workplace<br>because we spend so much time in our<br>workplaces um you know I'm working from<br>home today well half of the day anyway<br>um but our workplaces they are both a<br>source of employment so Economic<br>Security so we kind of need a workplace<br>or um employment um and so if those<br>places can shift from being to M neutral<br>to M positive um that's where you're<br>going to have some really great gains uh<br>so that's thinking about the types of<br>offerings that your employer could be<br>making um the types of collegial<br>relationships that encourage tal milder<br>use um manag some of the the Dynamics<br>that can be created um just in the<br>workplace generally because you're<br>dealing with relationships and that kind<br>of thing um yeah so I'll carry on<br>um okay um thanks J Jacob thanks over oh<br>Michaela<br>ker um okay how do you best manage<br>language when there are presses from<br>your<br>Faro um<br>oh probably need to know bit more what<br>type of pressures if are um I think<br>so uh it would be different yeah yeah if<br>you give me more more um context to that<br>so so do you mean<br>um uh uh speakers of to M already and<br>you're not a speaker or um you want to<br>be a speaker and then they are kind of<br>not that supportive of Tel so in the<br>second instance if let's say you're a<br>learner of Tel Mali and you really want<br>to learn Tel maldi and speak Tel Mali<br>but there's some resistance that can<br>create language anxiety so um what that<br>might mean is that you refer to your<br>Copa paano so your copao are Foo who you<br>will rely on to grow that confidence um<br>in ensuring that you have uh that<br>support that you need until the time<br>that your F kind of comes along with you<br>for the ride um and we can just hope<br>that everybody gets there so Craig K<br>Michaela um and Craig given that so many<br>Learners oh sorry yeah um answered that<br>I think<br>um uh so this is a work question how do<br>you see vdubs supporting more language<br>Learners of Staff apart from<br>professional development courses um<br>so already have some great um activities<br>for students but um I suppose part of it<br>is the fact that we don't really<br>um we don't really have many schemes to<br>to support um kind of collegial<br>relationships and you know I don't know<br>if that can be um the job of taka Mai<br>given that you know we're already kind<br>of a very small school within a very<br>large um kind of uh institution so<br>that's a great question maybe one that<br>you could propose to um your col<br>colleages of which I am one but yeah<br>other colleagues as well so in an odd<br>way it sounds as though the more people<br>learn to do M and become proficient the<br>more<br>anxiety producing the project becomes<br>for those who are<br>beginners<br>um no no that's that's um I'm not sure<br>if that's what<br>I got from that so<br>um I think that's good to to hear that's<br>how you've interpreted this this data um<br>but the what what um what I interpreted<br>that is is that we have lots of<br>different stages that we're in in the<br>language revitalization space so we have<br>people who have been raised speaking to<br>their Mali so of course they're not<br>going to feel anxious speaking taly my<br>kids won't feel anxious speaking t m<br>because they've never<br>um experience what it's like to not be<br>able to speak T El MDI um that's very<br>different from my own experience so um<br>yeah so so it's a it's kind of the fact<br>that we've got lots of different<br>groupings of people who um<br>are at different stages of the<br>revitalization process so um that's<br>that's probably the best way that I can<br>answer that without um much more context<br>okay<br>best way that Toby we can help<br>Revitalize to M respectfully that's<br>great great question um so if you um it<br>depends on again it's going back to<br>where does your power lie and how are<br>you engaging in power sharing so um if<br>you are if you're a manager um how are<br>you enabling your your staff to um Excel<br>and in tial M what what affordances are<br>you granting um uh you know your staff<br>to to engage in that space um let's say<br>you're you're not a um yeah actually so<br>so not even in a managerial sort of<br>situation just as a personto person um<br>it's kind of shouldering some of the<br>heavy load that um that relieves us as I<br>Mii of for dealing with some of the the<br>pressures associated with racism um<br>colonization and that kind of thing so<br>if you can sort of anticipate or see<br>some of the Dynamics that are created um<br>within particular context around you and<br>interpersonal relationships or anything<br>like that um if there are dynamics there<br>that you can see are actually harmful or<br>perpetuating ideas of white supremacy um<br>then you know a great cont contribution<br>is a to um kind of educate yourself<br>about some of those issues um and<br>actually the um the me and white<br>supremacy book is really good book um<br>for um you know any T who are interested<br>in in shifting their ideas about how<br>white supremacy actually impacts on um<br>on our relationships and that that book<br>was written um not in New Zealand<br>obviously but um there are definitely uh<br>things that we can learn from that as<br>well as the um how to be anti-racist so<br>it's not good enough just to be um not<br>racist because you know we we all see<br>that Donald Trump is not racist and well<br>you know that's how he sees himself so<br>um we need to sort of shift the bar um<br>so yeah thinking there's lots of things<br>that can be done so Gilda thank you for<br>um<br>yes<br>oh so as an ethnomusicologist and<br>Speaker of Hawaiian uh can you speak to<br>how performances of T of to music can<br>help learn learn the language and fakar<br>sometimes encountered when learning to<br>oh this is a great party thank you so<br>much for that question so um yeah in in<br>terms of um so there's lots of<br>activities that we can do to release<br>fakar and release fear and we is one of<br>those activities so um because it can be<br>done independently and collectively so<br>privately and publicly it means that um<br>that we can be using the language um<br>kind of of also at a subconscious level<br>so it doesn't always have to be an<br>active learning task um and so but way<br>as an act a collective act also has the<br>ability to calm the nervous system so<br>way like that's a ma a major um<br>contributor to um yeah calming nerves<br>and um creating that kind of collect<br>collective um sense of Oneness or<br>belonging together so yeah K Lots can't<br>wait to um have you<br>too okay Craig have you to share part<br>so okay<br>definely<br>yes um okay aside from the written<br>materials are there any apps available<br>Play Store um yes so um probably the<br>um uh so so I literally have like a<br>um so I've um this is this is my poer we<br>can still buy it<br>from B books or oh not bck books<br>obviously um but there's a whole list<br>here of things that you can do um to<br>improve different aspects of your<br>learning and somebody asked about<br>sentence structure you know breaking<br>them up is sometimes an easy way to do<br>that um but um so yeah there's lots of<br>podcasts so every day M if you if you're<br>sort of a new learner of to maldi um<br>tinger is a really great podcast for<br>kind of those that are shifting into<br>real Duo spaces who can kind of follow a<br>conversation along um uh<br>the jeez I need my phone um but yeah the<br>the apps um the tahu if you follow hiu<br>um they they have an app which is like<br>all of the um real I like the real<br>Ed um uh that's in one place so there's<br>lots of things to try so maybe it's just<br>a try and see which works for you so<br>c um<br>K which way of learning to deal is most<br>impactful um so everything so it's about<br>trying to work out your<br>um uh what yeah so if like one of the<br>things that I suggest is that people<br>kind of audit their language um input<br>and output so how much input you so you<br>need a lot of input in order to um<br>produce to um with any language right so<br>input is um can be visual or it can be<br>auditor you know so as well as you know<br>like the emotions feeling the the<br>language and all that kind of thing but<br>um so so a good idea is to set a task of<br>what you're reading be conscious of what<br>you're reading um how intentional are<br>you in that reading process um is this<br>like an active learning thing or is it<br>just kind of flippant I'm just looking<br>at things that happen to be around me um<br>so what you're trying to do is um create<br>small incremental steps of um of input<br>so if if you're reading then that's<br>going to help you to familiarize<br>yourselves with what a word looks like<br>like um compared with yeah um what a<br>word sounds like so you're going to need<br>that combination of both of those things<br>um and there are some great yeah there's<br>some great resources that um that are<br>out there<br>um oh sorry oh so so this was um that's<br>just my book Hard Sell<br>there um and so and that's the other one<br>that I had um the m at home one just<br>sitting<br>there Ka okay so looks like we don't<br>have any more party um not yeah but um<br>as I said I'll just share um so you can<br>um find me at these places um yeah if<br>it's a work kind of related question<br>definitely email me um but um yeah if<br>it's kind of just uh I I put lots of<br>resources of my own thinking kind of<br>onto Instagram mainly and I actually<br>have kind of stopped using Twitter a<br>little bit or X but anyway those are<br>where you can find me okay kaie great to<br>um have you all thanks again for coming<br>and um look forward to um meeting your</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
