it's been amazing yeah<br>I've been really lucky to train here<br>this year been amongst a great bunch of<br>doctors and nurses and staff in general<br>that are are really supportive we Rave<br>to each other every day about all the<br>awesome experiences we get to have and<br>privilege I'm Professor Tim Wilkinson<br>I'm the acting dean of theago medical<br>school here ATO we're Pioneers in rural<br>Health we've been doing it for many many<br>years we've had a longstanding<br>commitment we put our money where our<br>mouth is by training students by<br>training doctors and supporting<br>practicing doctors over decades in 2023<br>we had medical students in 57 different<br>places in New Zealand and 48 of those<br>were at rural settings I'm Gary Nixon<br>professor of rural Health University of<br>atago as well as a rural Hospital<br>medicine specialist here at Dunston<br>Hospital in Clyde atago's Geographic<br>footprint means that we are very very<br>much a leader in the delivery of rural<br>health education in in New Zealand the<br>problem in the past has been that rural<br>people have been under represented in<br>our doctors and we want to fix that and<br>one way of fixing that is making sure<br>that we encourage people with a rural<br>background to apply and enter medical<br>school we know that if students learn in<br>rural communities they're much more<br>likely to come back and practice there<br>they feel supported they feel a<br>commitment to that region for me it's a<br>WI when Mary we're just going to give<br>you some medication might help you<br>breathe better okay I'm Janine ler I'm<br>Clinical Director of the rural medical<br>emission program at atago University and<br>Rural Hospital doctor at asban hospital<br>the rural medical emotion program is a<br>one-year program for fifth year medical<br>students at aago University they take a<br>year out from their traditional academic<br>program to spend a year living and<br>learning in rural communities the rural<br>medical emersion program started in 2007<br>in Queenstown and the West Coast with<br>six students it grew from there quite<br>quickly to include Tado wedaa malur and<br>CLA and then in 2020 ashb came on board<br>in 2023 we were granted more Government<br>funding to expand further so now we have<br>new sites in wiar this year and<br>heart my name is t I'm a medical student<br>here doing the rural medical immersion<br>program in t we get a lot more um<br>focused with the doctors it's all<br>oneon-one we're able to do skills that<br>we wouldn't really otherwise get to do<br>in a large hospital it's just so<br>beautiful being able to connect and<br>establish some with our community I<br>uh call McKenzie<br>Wilson uh my name's McKenzie I'm doing<br>my fifth year rmip here in wi this year<br>we've had excellent learning<br>opportunities and I would say like we've<br>got such a good basis from this year<br>especially going into our exams at the<br>end of the year I think it's actually<br>charge Kor I'm Dr liffy rimmer I'm a GP<br>in rural Hospital doctor and I'm the<br>coordinator of the rmip program in white<br>or it's been great the student have been<br>a wonderful three young women they have<br>brought a lot of enthusiasm and energy<br>definitely seen their confidence<br>increase I think it's made them much<br>more resilient self-reliant we have the<br>highest per capita Mai population in<br>altero so that's around about 60% since<br>day do I think we've noticed the impact<br>that the natural disasters that have<br>been going on in the country have<br>affected the farno here and it's evident<br>in their health and wellbeing in the<br>land the fina here they come away with a<br>wider appreciation of that sort of<br>socioeconomic impact on<br>health a lot of the House services they<br>are under a lot of pressure and there<br>can be a right time and there can be a<br>wrong time to expand into those<br>communities I think you know given our<br>our connections means that we're well<br>positioned to be able to do that in a<br>way that it achieves Workforce gains<br>that we want to achieve but without<br>putting undue pressure on those often<br>fragile Health<br>servicesa can be very proud with how it<br>has addressed social accountability for<br>those groups and how it has engaged with<br>those communities they become really<br>involved in the local community it's not<br>just the healthcare learning they join<br>sports teams become members of clubs<br>within the healthcare environment they<br>become strong advocates for their<br>patients they've been playing netball<br>paddle ball they've been competing for<br>WID and the CrossFit champion ships<br>there can't be many Foo in WID that<br>haven't met at least one of our students<br>yet are you managing to get up and move<br>around at all we know from new New<br>Zealand data coming through that these<br>the graduates of rmip are nearly six<br>times as likely to return to rural<br>graduation met two more here and I'm a<br>fifth year rmip student at dunon<br>hospital yes I grew up rurally in atago<br>South atago Region was brought up on a<br>farm when I left High School I wasn't<br>too sure what I was going to do but at<br>that time I was able to share sheep so<br>carried on and did that as a job and<br>then progressed on to coming in back<br>into University but I had no idea that<br>about studying medicine that wasn't<br>something that was really on my radar I<br>know coming into the program I was<br>always excited about being able to get<br>this sort of exposure but I think this<br>year has kind of consolidated a lot of<br>uh my previous thoughts about working in<br>rural communities and going back to<br>serve the people of the communities that<br>I come from has you been having any<br>fevers associated with that at all I'm<br>Steven Potter I'm a fifth year ATO<br>medical student placed here in ashon<br>through rmip I originally came from<br>inago but what rmip has meant for me is<br>it's given me exposure to this smaller<br>Community which actually reminds me a<br>bit of home um I originally was like I'm<br>never going back to those small<br>communities again but actually being<br>back here and seeing the small<br>communities has made me kind of con<br>consider quite strongly you know maybe<br>this is actually where the better<br>lifestyle is maybe this is the type of<br>medicine that I want to practice if<br>you're the sort of person that's likes<br>being out there trying new things<br>community-minded really likes learning<br>from patients getting Hands-On<br>experiences in rmip is absolutely<br>program for you we also have two<br>additional programs one in Tyra and one<br>on the west coast where we focus on<br>interprofessional learning and it has<br>the original dentist example that was<br>proposed I'm Georgie beard the program<br>leader for the atago University ipu<br>program we have a group of final year<br>students that come and live and do their<br>study in Tia for a 5we program we have<br>medical students Dental students oral<br>health<br>physiotherapy Pharmacy and then we also<br>Outsource from other providers so we<br>Podiatry they live together in hospital<br>flets they work together on projects<br>they have their placements in their own<br>um specialty area and then they also go<br>and visit their their student colleagues<br>well up my name is Reef Edwards I'm a<br>six-year med student through aago uni<br>here up in gbbn doing the ipe project I<br>suppose in medicine it's easy to get<br>isolated in your own profession but<br>being able to have that opportunity to<br>talk and discuss different cases with um<br>other professions and other students the<br>different professions is really valuable<br>to me wants to get out of it it's been<br>interesting just being able to meet with<br>Marty patients and you can connect with<br>them on that different kind of level you<br>know like I found that patients will<br>often tell me things that they have kind<br>of neglected to say to the consultant um<br>I would enough it's because I'm Mighty<br>as well and just can have a yarn like a<br>little bit more openly but I suppose<br>that's kind of highlighted the need for<br>more Marty health professionals in the<br>area it can be a bit of a misconception<br>that once you exit medical school that<br>your training's finished and many<br>respects is really only beginning<br>because that's when you start your<br>vocational training and your relevant<br>specialty so in terms of generating a a<br>future rural Workforce probably this is<br>the area where ataro even by Australian<br>australasian standards has really been a<br>leader how are you feeling today I'm Dr<br>Rachel Linsky I'm a rural Hospital<br>Hospital Specialists working at Dunston<br>Hospital in central otago I was one of<br>the very first rural medical imersion<br>students in 2007 I was based in<br>Greymouth hospital for the fifth year of<br>my medical training and I came down to<br>calago as a house officer and then again<br>as a register and that was the time that<br>I that my love for Rural medicine and<br>Rural towns really grew and I knew that<br>it was the path that I wanted to take I<br>think rural Hospital medicine is a is a<br>really exciting pathway you have to know<br>a little bit about everything you get to<br>work with a small cohesive team yeah<br>just managing all sorts of things that<br>come in the door it's a really nice way<br>to be able to look after your own<br>Community as well I couldn't get a line<br>she's got Burns and both both upper arms<br>I think we might have to go iio as part<br>of our partnership with the Ashburn<br>Community we have a Simulation Center in<br>ashb<br>and light flashing well they bring<br>together um doctors and nurses from the<br>Ral Health Service and give them an<br>opportunity to train in that simulation<br>environment particularly to handle you<br>know trauma and medical emergencies 90<br>seconds she will not be<br>breathing our research program is now a<br>multi-million dollar program in terms of<br>bringing in external research funding<br>and it's a very abroad program as well<br>so a lot of recent work has concentrated<br>on access to health services for people<br>areas together we will continue to<br>innovate and educate I'm really pleased<br>that here at the University ofo Medical<br>School we've just launched the Center<br>for Rural Health it's a culmination of<br>our commitment to rural health over many<br>many years we've been doing training of<br>medical students postgraduate doctors<br>and supporting practicing doctors in<br>rural Health but this is an opportunity<br>for us to bring it all together under<br>one<br>umbrella one of the biggest challenges<br>we face is Rural High School Kids<br>actually thinking about medicine as as a<br>possibility for them I mean I've<br>practiced here my entire career pretty<br>close to where I grew up I know that<br>these are the best Medical Careers and<br>it would be really good if there was<br>just a few more real kids who saw that<br>as a option and an opportunity for them<br>we certainly get up to make that happen<br>if they make that choice and certainly<br>get up to try and support them for every<br>step of the way I'd say don't be afraid<br>to put yourself out out there and to be<br>uncomfortable I think a lot of students<br>ster away from rural placements because<br>you're isolated you might not be with<br>people that you know very well I feel<br>this year in my entire medical Journey<br>has been the most transformative I've<br>formed such close friendships I've had<br>the opportunity to be immersed in a<br>mildy community we've parted rural<br>medical education in New Zealand we've<br>got the links we've got the experience<br>we've got the bread and we're really</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
