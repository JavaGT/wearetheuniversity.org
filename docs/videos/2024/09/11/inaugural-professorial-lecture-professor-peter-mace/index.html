pleasure to be here on<br>behalf of the vice chancellor who<br>unfortunately is traveling at the moment<br>um expelling the greatness of otago on<br>the other side of the world for us um<br>but I get to be here on his behalf to<br>say a huge congratulations to you Peter<br>and to acknowledge um this significant<br>and very special occasion so tonight we<br>Mark and we celebrate the elevation of<br>Peter mace to Professor there are four<br>initials that can drive fear fear<br>ambition or just plain bewilderment into<br>academics here at otago anyone want to<br>have a go at them s o<br>l c these stand for sustained<br>outstanding leadership and sustained<br>outstanding competence they are the<br>promotion criteria to be promoted to<br>Professor here at otago the criteria are<br>demanding they state that the university<br>will look for leadership exceptional<br>ability and original thought in pursuit<br>of research with respect to teaching the<br>candidate must show exceptional ability<br>to inspire High academic Endeavor and<br>for original thought and in service that<br>amounts to a sustained contribution of<br>great significance and distinction the<br>bar is very<br>high and the process itself is<br>incredibly demanding Peter's application<br>took months to get through the process<br>not because of Peter but because that's<br>how we do things at<br>otaco so the process involved satisfying<br>many people sitting on three different<br>committees across the university that he<br>is worthy of the promotion to Professor<br>it is a very significant achievement and<br>it signals our professors As Leaders<br>leaders in the disciplinary field<br>leaders among their students and leaders<br>within the wider university community<br>and Peter I want to warmly welcome you<br>to the professorate of<br>otago in days gone by the inaugural<br>professorial lecture may have been<br>understood as the event at which the<br>candidate had to stand and justify their<br>promotion we might have had a discussion<br>about this just a couple of minutes ago<br>what exactly does Peter have to do this<br>evening thankfully he does not have to<br>prove his Worth to us instead this<br>evening is a chance for us to pause and<br>together to mark his significant<br>achievement to hear about his journey<br>and his work and to enjoy the<br>opportunity that we have now this<br>evening for the next hour to learn more<br>about his research and the change that<br>it has brought to the world around us<br>and we're very looking forward to that<br>so Peter thank you thank you for the<br>time you've put into this lecture thank<br>you for what it signifies in terms of a<br>career of significant work and research<br>before um we have Peter come up to the<br>stand to the podium I want to welcome<br>Professor medu Smith who is the dean of<br>biomedical Sciences in which Peter works<br>and she will introduce our guest of<br>honor<br>Peter mace so welcome everybody my name<br>is Lisa maty Smith I am the dean of<br>biomedical sciences and I am incredibly<br>proud to um be able to be here to<br>introduce uh the inaug inaugural<br>professorial lecture of Professor Peter<br>mace<br>so come<br>in come in come<br>show okay so Peter uh is otago<br>University through and through uh he<br>received his his BSC with first class<br>honors uh from the University of aago in<br>2002 um after winning uh Forest top<br>achiever doctoral scholarship uh he<br>started his PhD here which he received<br>in 2006 this was followed by a postdoc<br>from 2006 to 2009 here at the University<br>of otago in 2010 he won a US Department<br>of Defense breast cancer research<br>Fellowship good to know that they're<br>investing in good research there the uh<br>Defense US Department of Defense<br>um and uh went over to Sanford Burnham<br>Medical Center Institute in La Hoya<br>California uh and then he returned to<br>aago uh in June of 2013 to take up a<br>role as a research fellow in<br>Biochemistry Department after being<br>awarded a Rutherford Discovery<br>Fellowship uh from the Royal Society in<br>uh 2012 in 2016 he was promoted to<br>senior research fellow and then in July<br>of<br>2017 uh he became a senior lecturer in<br>the Department of biochemistry by 2020<br>he was an associate professor and of<br>course this year was promoted to the<br>role of Professor so I think you will<br>see as we start running through uh the<br>accolades that um Peter definitely has<br>achieved thec and research uh teaching<br>and service so Peter has published uh 56<br>papers in international referee journals<br>and one book chapter these journals uh<br>it's quite an impressive read go through<br>looking at the journals where where um<br>Peter has published you know we're all<br>incredibly thrilled and excited and it's<br>it's a great achievement to get one<br>paper uh in science or or many of the<br>journals that um that Peter has<br>published in which include science<br>nature pnas eife nature Communications<br>nature biotechnology nature structural<br>and molecular biology American Journal<br>of human genetics and the list goes on<br>um it's it's a regular sequence of<br>publishing in in top uh International<br>journals um and I notice receiving<br>numerous covered uh articles so he makes<br>nice pictures as well<br>clearly um Peter has received as Pi um<br>multiple major research grants over<br>totaling over 8<br>million uh of external funding from the<br>Marsden fund of the Royal Society he's<br>received three three count them<br>uh health research Council uh New<br>Zealand project grants uh so in 2014<br>2017 and<br>2022 uh Peter collaborates with<br>researchers across the country uh and in<br>Australia uh UK and the<br>us he has won numerous Awards in<br>addition to his Rutherford Discovery<br>Fellowship uh and a<br>2016 uh early career award for<br>distinction in research here at the<br>University of Chago in 2018 he won the<br>thermofisher uh scientific award award<br>for excellence and molecular biology in<br>2022 the University of otaga rowy trust<br>award and Carl Smith medal uh and this<br>year he uh became a guest fellow with<br>the cluster of Excellence on plant<br>science at the University of Cologne<br>Germany he's also an incredibly popular<br>and outstanding enthusiastic uh teacher<br>who teaches um how molecular knowledge<br>impacts critical biological processes uh<br>at all levels from teaching into our<br>large uh first year class B 192<br>foundations and biochemistry um and all<br>the way through to postgraduate um<br>research uh or teaching and supervision<br>to date he has supervised uh two<br>completions seven phds three msc's and<br>numerous honors students and he's<br>currently supervising five I five PhD<br>students and and one uh MSC<br>student he's also taken on numerous uh<br>service roles many of them uh around<br>research and and there's no question<br>that that Peter is uh a leading<br>researcher here at the University and a<br>supporter of research um taking on<br>Research roles in the department um<br>research<br>infrastructure uh support roles um and<br>Leadership uh at the University and<br>nationally uh he's a regular conference<br>and session organizer reviewer for<br>numerous journals and international<br>funding agencies um he's given a number<br>of invited lectures uh and is engaged in<br>um an incredible amount of Outreach uh<br>to the broader Community including<br>science Wan Advanced School Sciences<br>Academy and um taking his research and<br>talking uh to numerous School groups<br>he's a president of the New Zealand<br>Society of biochemistry and molecular<br>biology and most importantly from my<br>perspective um he is the associate Dean<br>research for the school of biomedical<br>Sciences so um he is is my right hand uh<br>in terms of really providing um<br>Direction uh and um strategic advice uh<br>and supporting research in the school of<br>biomedical sciences and for that I am<br>very grateful um to Peter but it's also<br>meant that I've got know Peter uh much<br>better so I'm very very um glad of that<br>so tonight uh Peter's going to talk<br>about his research and how uh his<br>research tackles how the<br>three-dimensional structure of proteins<br>allows them to control cell cellular<br>behavior in the context of human cells<br>his work aims to understand protein<br>signaling in progression and treatment<br>of cancer inflammation and metabolic<br>diseases understanding the structure of<br>signaling proteins is key to unlocking<br>insights into a broad spectrum of<br>cellular processes and his work has made<br>significant contributions to<br>understanding a range of biological<br>processes spanning from mamalian<br>ovulation the complex dynamics of cancer<br>cells and the cellular protein<br>degradation Machinery in the process<br>this research has also shed light on<br>proteins that determine effectiveness of<br>current therapies and potential avenues<br>for new therapies a structural biology<br>operates at the crossroads of bi biology<br>chemistry and physics Peter's lecture<br>will also highlight how technological<br>advances have continuously reshaped the<br>field continually changing how we<br>interrogate the molecular underpinnings<br>of life so please join me in welcoming<br>Professor Peter mace uh for his<br>inaugural<br>so thank you very much thank you very<br>much Lisa for the very kind introduction<br>felt like you're talking about someone<br>else there um thank you all of you for<br>coming um everyone from my family who<br>were obviously there um from day one um<br>to some of my third year class so I was<br>lecturing this morning<br>um so today it's just a fantastic<br>opportunity to talk to you about how I<br>got to where I am so really I'm going to<br>be talking about what I do based ac<br>across time so we're going to look at<br>how I got to where I start uh where I<br>started to um where I am now um but<br>we're going to start a little in the<br>abstract a bit um because the big<br>picture of my research is actually<br>really really small because we're<br>looking at how things happen within the<br>inside of<br>cells so if I put this um animation up<br>on screen if you're over a certain age<br>you're probably already hoping to get<br>another one of those long orange blocks<br>so that you can get that um that bit I'm<br>going to leave you hanging there um it's<br>for those of you are a little bit<br>younger it's like an archaic version of<br>Minecraft um I'm going to make the<br>argument that cells are doing this all<br>the time so they um so sorry this is<br>that that is Tetris we need the the goal<br>is to most efficiently pack those blocks<br>those blocks need to fit together in an<br>ideal manner to fill all those gaps it's<br>all about the three well the shape of<br>those uh blocks but this is<br>two-dimensional cells are doing<br>something pretty much the whole time<br>which is similar they might have a<br>molecule on the outside that they need<br>to sense they have an apparatus which<br>can sense where those uh that signal is<br>um they have a whole bunch of molecules<br>inside the cell that fit together in<br>just perfect manner um to form what we<br>think of as a signaling pathway and so<br>that signaling pathway um is made up of<br>molecules mainly called proteins and so<br>that's this really the subject of U my<br>work and once that signaling pathway is<br>assembled once those proteins all fit<br>together in just the ideal manner um<br>that helps that a a cell decide it's<br>it's seen that signal on the outside of<br>the cell um it's got to make a decision<br>about it might decide oh I need to move<br>so it will mate based on how those<br>proteins interact or it might be I need<br>to change which genes I'm expressing so<br>that um I might need to proliferate or I<br>might need sense that that signal is a<br>really dangerous signal I might need to<br>commit to something like cell death so<br>how these proteins interact in um within<br>the cell governs basically all of<br>biology but of course it's not quite<br>that simple Tetris blocks are<br>two-dimensional so they fit together uh<br>naturally um quite well um Minecraft is<br>three-dimensional um so even that is a<br>vast oversimplification those blocks fit<br>together a bit better um but the pro the<br>the proteins that we study um they are<br>hundreds or thousands of atoms that all<br>fit um together in just the right way to<br>be able to mediate all of those<br>different signaling Pathways so this is<br>something that's fascinated me uh really<br>for a long time really boggling my mind<br>about how this even work like how does<br>this not go wrong just all of the time<br>inside every cell of your body you've<br>got these three-dimensional molecules<br>fitting together in just a perfect way<br>um so that your cells can do what they<br>meant to<br>99.999% of the time it's just<br>mindboggling um so that's the bigger<br>picture of my research um but of course<br>I didn't um start off uh thinking that<br>way so I uh already I guess talking<br>about Tetris I've aged myself um I was<br>born in the early ' 80s um I grew up in<br>uh tooa um so it's a a picture of me on<br>the day that I was born and this is a<br>great opportunity to show my older<br>brother Simon with his finger up his<br>nose um but uh I was the fourth out of<br>um five children um so my it's a great<br>honor to have my parents in the audience<br>here um we're probably the five blondest<br>kids in the it's it's a very blonde set<br>of um kids um tooa of course is a very<br>um forestry oriented town um and so we<br>did do regular class photos but this is<br>a class photo from when I was at Primary<br>School the neighbors were cutting down<br>their tree and this was worthy of a<br>class trip because it was a great a good<br>tree um so this is my entire class<br>coming to the um to the tree fellon um<br>so played lots of um soccer and Cricket<br>growing up um I when I was researching<br>this talk I was very happy the internet<br>seems to have erased all um evidence of<br>our record losses of some of our soccer<br>teams um so we we played lots of soccer<br>and cre we weren't necessarily brilliant<br>um educationally um I guess I was kind<br>of gravitated towards doing science and<br>maths as you might have um guessed by um<br>where I've ended up um but I had a<br>really um really enthusiastic biology<br>teacher at high school um who I guess<br>maybe triggered more interest in biology<br>um than some of my siblings and uh my<br>wher family and so thinking um about<br>that uh larger um family so this is a<br>picture of um all of the cousins on my<br>um father's uh side of the family my<br>mother's side of the family the um the<br>sample size is a little bit smaller um<br>so we won't we don't have um enough<br>replicates for statistical analysis<br>there um but everyone on Dad's side of<br>the family who studied engineering um<br>has a circle around their head there so<br>we're running at about um 50% um so I<br>guess when it came to thinking about<br>where I was going to go to university um<br>I didn't actually know about how<br>spectacular Tigo Peninsula was at that<br>stage um but uh something a bit a bit<br>more biological um really sprung to mind<br>I know there's a lot of geneticists in<br>the audience so this can also be<br>displayed in this manner um and so my<br>immediate family is uh indicated there<br>and so engineering is the disease shall<br>we say um and uh tertiary education in<br>Christ Church is kind of a you're a<br>carrier or if you've done tertiary<br>education Christ Church so Mom and Helen<br>both did tertiary education in Christ<br>church so I guess I'm the only one who<br>had some sort of protective mutation um<br>from Christ Church um so I guess what<br>drew me South initially um was this<br>thought that I was going to do medicine<br>and so this is my first year um ID card<br>first thing to note here apparently my<br>birth date was wrong when I enrolled for<br>University so that birth date is wrong<br>on my ID card um but the thing just<br>below that is showing that um I enrolled<br>to do Health Sciences so I came down<br>here um planning to be a doctor I guess<br>when you gravitate towards um science<br>and maths as a at a rural High School<br>the recommendations you'll get will be<br>to do medicine um and I got in so did<br>pretty well in first year and got about<br>two weeks in and then decided it really<br>wasn't for me um so I can't really put<br>my finger on it but I guess I think up<br>to that point I'd been driven by the<br>goal in front of me of like trying to<br>get over that hurdle of getting in um<br>and then up to that point I guess I<br>really wasn't thinking about beyond that<br>what it actually meant and what was<br>really underlying my curiosity all<br>through um up to that point well what I<br>really enjoyed was understanding how<br>these things worked and so I made what<br>was quite the I guess at the time quite<br>a tumultuous decision to take the<br>slightly less um direct path um and to<br>pull out of medicine um after two weeks<br>and decided to do a degree in<br>Biochemistry because it was the subject<br>that found uh both because it was most<br>interesting to me in first year but also<br>the potential I felt like the potential<br>if you can discover how a molecule works<br>you can potentially help millions of<br>people um if you're a doctor you can<br>also help people in various different<br>ways but I figured if you I guess it's a<br>bit of a gamble you can you can take a<br>take a bit you might discover something<br>big um and help lots of people so I did<br>my degree in Biochemistry so that's um<br>me in front of my flat with um Mom and<br>Dad on the day that I<br>graduated um and so I finished my honors<br>degree in Biochemistry and I guess<br>there's a bit of a pattern developing<br>here up till near the end of fourth year<br>I hadn't really thought that much about<br>what I was going to do after that um but<br>at that stage I um went into John's<br>office and uh John my PhD supervisor<br>John cutfield um started suggesting this<br>project um to me which really captured<br>my interest thinking about how things um<br>work in uh three dimensions so the<br>project that I did for my pH D was<br>really um it was a a project that his<br>partner Sue cutfield um was working on<br>and it just recently got some funding on<br>and it's really a good example of the<br>the relationship between primary<br>industry and um fundamental science and<br>New Zealand because um Sue Galloway who<br>was a a researcher at egg research which<br>had a molecular biology unit just down<br>our um hallway at the time had made a<br>discovery about how inadale sheep so<br>inadale sheep have twins really<br>frequently and they had narrowed down<br>and nailed down the mutation that caused<br>Infidel sheep to Twin more frequently<br>than regular sheep and this had been<br>selected for by New Zealand Farmers um<br>because twins are good because you have<br>two Lambs that you can sell um dud<br>worked out that this mut there was a<br>mutation and a growth factor that was<br>secreted by the uite which um signaled<br>to the cells that surround the um uite<br>so these are called granulosa cells um<br>and somehow that growth factor<br>controlled proliferation of the cell<br>cells surrounding it so it was a a<br>mechanism of communication between the<br>urite and uh the cells surrounding it um<br>we wanted to know how these proteins um<br>fit together in three dimensions so<br>we're going to take a little bit of a a<br>segue at this point to talk about how we<br>can actually um work that out so how do<br>we work out the 3D structure of proteins<br>or how we did um then so we've already<br>represented proteins as blocks um if<br>you're looking at a textbook sometimes<br>proteins will be drawn as kind of jelly<br>bean shaped um molecules um for the rest<br>of my talk I'm going to be representing<br>proteins looking something like these<br>kind of cartoon things which uh have<br>these kind of ribbons that form nice<br>heles we call them um beta sheets and um<br>beta strands um but what this is is a<br>simplification of hundreds and thousands<br>of carbon nitrogen oxygen um atoms Andy<br>hen atoms with a few sulfurs throwing in<br>throwing in linked together in a chain<br>which we call a polypeptide chain um and<br>so knowing the exact three-dimensional<br>position of all of these atoms within<br>this protein um it basically governs<br>everything about how it fits with other<br>proteins how it combined to small<br>molecules how it combined to drugs so<br>knowledge of that those<br>three-dimensional positions is really<br>crucial to everything so how do we<br>actually um work that out um I'm not<br>going to go into too much detail here<br>other than to say um first of all you<br>need to make that protein clearly um so<br>what we'll do is clone the gene for that<br>protein put it into an expression system<br>um and work out how to purify that<br>protein and so this is a case where that<br>protein has been purified really really<br>nicely if we can purify that protein um<br>the next step is well um one way of<br>solving a structure is to grow a crystal<br>of it and so um this is very very Hit or<br>Miss um so you need to screen thousands<br>of different conditions often to<br>crystallize a protein um so nowadays we<br>use robotics um to grow these crystals<br>and if we get really really lucky we<br>then with our shaky hand have to Loop<br>that tiny crystal out which might be a<br>0.1 millimeter Crystal was quite a big<br>Crystal to Loop out um and then we put<br>it in a really powerful x-ray beam um<br>nowadays what we'll do is put uh take<br>that Crystal over to Australia to the<br>synchron where they have really really<br>high powered x-rays um and if everything<br>goes really well that Crystal defract<br>x-rays um and we can um calculate this<br>kind of map which tells us the position<br>of every one of those<br>atoms um and as uh Lisa already alluded<br>to this really um I I really liked this<br>whole process firstly because this um a<br>map of where everything is in three<br>dimensions of of the atoms of a protein<br>this is the closest you're ever going to<br>get to ground truth in biology biolog is<br>very squishy um there's lots of<br>uncertainty in biology but what that<br>protein looks like where all the atoms<br>actually sit it's it's about as close as<br>you get to certainty in um biology um<br>but of course it to get there we need<br>lots of different aspects we need to<br>touch on biology to make those proteins<br>we need plenty of chemistry to be able<br>to grow crystals of those um proteins um<br>and then we need plenty of physics and<br>Computing to be able to C calate those<br>structures but then at the end of the<br>day what we really care about is biology<br>we want to understand how those proteins<br>function um to be able to um basically<br>make drugs or just understand uh<br>different systems the other thing about<br>this process though um there's a lot of<br>uncertainty there and so maybe I already<br>kind of established myself as a bit of a<br>gambler but um making that protein you<br>in the best case you might spend a few<br>weeks or never<br>um growing a crystal is even more hit or<br>miss um so if you're lucky a crystal<br>might grow overnight but or it can never<br>grow um and then solving a structure<br>again those crystals might not even<br>defract<br>x-rays um so getting back to my PhD um<br>for a good deal of my PhD um it looked<br>like we were tending towards the never<br>side of making these proteins um so I<br>learned a really massive amount of<br>protein expression um and trying to make<br>these soluble proteins so that we could<br>um study them<br>um I took one of the opportunities that<br>I had during my PhD um was I was having<br>lots of troubl making proteins but we<br>had collaborators who were based um at<br>the University of Helsinki in Finland um<br>and so I was lucky enough to receive the<br>first Elman pool traveling scholarship<br>which is a scholarship that's still<br>available to um PhD students here at<br>otago um and it allows um you to spend 3<br>to six months um overseas somewhere<br>that's going to help out with your pH<br>project um so I was lucky enough to<br>receive this um I was also lucky enough<br>to actually go and visit Elman pool at<br>Oxford um so he passed away a few years<br>ago now but um it was really nice to go<br>and have lunch with them and um<br>basically interact with this person who<br>was making this trip happen um so I also<br>took my first visit to a synchron so I<br>went to the synchron in um New York Long<br>Island New York um on my way to Finland<br>um and this is a picture of me at about<br>midnight at a lake um in the North of<br>Finland at the collaborator lake so it<br>never really got very dark so was a we<br>didn't make protein in theend we made<br>some protein didn't really help but it<br>was a great experience in terms of just<br>experiencing um how science is done<br>elsewhere and just knowing that science<br>really is the same area where you have<br>the same um challenges one of the other<br>really fantastic opportunities I had was<br>while I was in Finland um the Royal<br>Society advertised for people who are<br>interested in going to a conference<br>called the lindow Nobel conference and<br>so what this conference is there's an<br>island called Linda which is in the<br>south of Germany um and every year they<br>have a conference where they invite um<br>Nobel Prize winners um along and a bunch<br>of early career researchers so PhD<br>students um postto from all around the<br>world to interact with these Nobel Prize<br>winners so they had um there was 44<br>Nobel Prize winners the year that I went<br>there and about 400 um students and so<br>they were just giving topics all around<br>what they once you're a Nobel Prize when<br>to just talk about whatever the heck you<br>want so they were talking about things<br>that were outside their interest or<br>whatever whatever they wanted um but<br>after so after Alan MCD who was the most<br>recent New Zealand Nobel Prize winner<br>gave his talk the three new zealanders<br>who were there um we went and introduced<br>ourselves and he was just um super<br>lovely he basically said ah come along<br>and have dinner at my hotel with my my<br>wife and I uh tonight and so he sent the<br>BMWs to pick us up um and we went and<br>had just a fantastic dinner um with Alan<br>MCD so that always um stick with me and<br>unfortunately he passed away a couple of<br>years just a couple of years after that<br>but he was um really lovely So<br>eventually I had to head back and face<br>the music um started playing a little<br>bit less golf with Yoshua nakatani who<br>was across the bench from me um but I<br>was eventually able to make some protein<br>um which grew these really spectacular<br>um crystals so those crystals diffracted<br>to really really high resolution and<br>that affects how much detail that we can<br>see in those proteins<br>um and with the help of Tom kedok Davis<br>who had started his PhD um with John um<br>well he had finished while I was<br>starting but then he was working at<br>Oakland and so I went to visit Tom in<br>ockland and collected um x-ray data<br>which allowed us to solve structures of<br>the receptors that bind to those growth<br>uh growth factors so we couldn't we<br>didn't quite answer the overall question<br>of how the growth factors bind to The<br>receptors um but we were able to see why<br>those receptors were different to other<br>members of the family um so to give us<br>some clues about um why they might<br>specifically um be binding to those<br>particular growth factors so we didn't<br>quite answer the overall question but we<br>answered a question which is quite often<br>how um science will go um so at that<br>stage I wrote up my PhD um and well but<br>uh my partner Gabrielle still about had<br>about a year and a half to run in her<br>PhD because she had started after me<br>over in the chemistry um Department um<br>and I had an opportunity to U Move<br>upstairs so uh Katherine day had um some<br>money um for a short-term appointment um<br>looking uh working on a project which is<br>now the core focus of Katherine's lab<br>but at that time it was really just the<br>early days of Katherine starting to look<br>at ubian uh<br>transfer um so I should say at this<br>stage um that short-term appointment<br>turned into a um a a longer term<br>appointment when I got funding from the<br>health science division um their<br>post-doctoral uh Career Development um<br>postdoctoral um Fellowship so that's why<br>I could stay working in this area for um<br>2 to 3 years well for 3<br>years so this area of ubiquit and<br>transfer ubiqutin is what we call a post<br>transational modification and so what<br>that means um a protein is floating<br>around in your cell um it then has a<br>modification made to it which changes<br>its function somehow it's like putting a<br>little tag put putting a Post-It note on<br>those proteins uh can change their<br>function in lots of different ways and<br>so ubiqutin is a pretty special um post<br>transational modification because what<br>it does is it it's kind of a signal to<br>the cell that we need to get rid of that<br>protein completely one of the things it<br>signals is let's degrade that protein<br>let's throw that protein out into the<br>trash um and so we call it a degradation<br>signal so the proteins that we were<br>looking at<br>um how ubium was transferred were some<br>key pathway<br>use this process of protein degradation<br>to control how they function and so the<br>first one um that we were looking at was<br>a protein called mdm2 and<br>mdmx um and so what these proteins do is<br>they function together to attach ubiquit<br>and chains to a little protein called<br>p-53 which if you're in a biology<br>Department you've probably heard of p-53<br>even if you're not in a biology<br>department p53 is basically uh Ground<br>Zero for cancer and so we we think of it<br>as the guardian of the genome and pretty<br>much or most cancers will eventually<br>damage their p-53 in some way um so that<br>well that's because p-53 is really<br>important for how a cell copes when a<br>when their DNA when its DNA gets damaged<br>um and so what mdm2 and mdmx can do is<br>put ubiquit and chains onto p-53 and<br>that gets rid of this guardian of the<br>genome so that's probably uh not going<br>to be a very uh good thing so what we<br>were able to do um working with kin link<br>and um Katherine we were able to solve<br>the three-dimensional structure of mdm2<br>binding to mdmx and so they had these<br>domains called ring domains and when we<br>solved the structure what we could see<br>is they form this kind of nice really<br>complimentary handshake that we think of<br>as a dier and so this is really<br>important for the ability of mdm2 and<br>mdmx to be able to transfer ubiqutin um<br>and the other thing we could do sorry<br>I'll just flick back<br>there or I won't look back oh yeah so we<br>could map how mdm2 bound to another<br>protein called an E2 protein and so an<br>E2 protein is important because what<br>that does is it brings um ubiqutin in to<br>be transferred all of you are my thir<br>year class you thought you got out of<br>you but couldn't lecture for today but<br>it's still going on um so what we could<br>do is then make predictions about how<br>the E2 is going to bind and when we<br>knocked out those residues that stops<br>mdm2 from being able to build those<br>ubiqutin chain so we could map how it<br>was um actually transferring<br>ubiqutin um we were also working on<br>another um class of<br>proteins called the inhibitor of<br>apotosis proteins and so inhibitor of<br>apotosis is the process of programmed<br>cell death um and so this is a really<br>important thing when we think about um<br>developing Cancer Treatments um but<br>inhibitor of eposis proteins when we<br>once we solved structures of them<br>actually bound to an E2 enzyme it turns<br>out they bound they formed this<br>handshake in a very similar manner to<br>mdm2 and mdmx so it looks like the IAP<br>proteins this dier that forms in this<br>kind of particular details of the<br>handshake um were really crucial to<br>being able to um transfer<br>ubiqutin um as I said apotosis is a<br>really important area for the devel<br>development of um cancer drugs and so at<br>the time um lots of different groups all<br>around the world we're developing what<br>we think of as IAP antagonist so these<br>are small molecule compounds that bind<br>to those inhib inhibitor of apotosis<br>proteins um and I won't go into all the<br>details because we got scooped in the<br>end um but um it turns out how these<br>molecules were working uh were they<br>bound to an IAP protein which is<br>normally locked up in a in an monoma<br>structure by itself they bind to the<br>monomer activate this dimer um and then<br>the I AP proteins put a whole lot of<br>youit in on themselves and so they're<br>destroyed out of the cell and then that<br>kills um the cancer cell so those drugs<br>went um relatively far through through<br>trials but eventually um haven't come<br>onto the market but they have been<br>useful in other ways which people are<br>still um developing and so this was a<br>really fruitful time um we were<br>collaborating lots with a a group at the<br>Welter and Eliza Hall um Institute in<br>Australia um and yeah kind of<br>establishing all these assays and things<br>that were um turn out to be um so that<br>Katherine's still using them in her lab<br>we're using similar methods in projects<br>that we've got going on but at a couple<br>of different<br>conferences um I talking about inhibitor<br>of apotosis proteins with a um Professor<br>called guy salvon and so he had done<br>some of the early work on inhibitor of<br>apotosis proteins and he suggested that<br>there was um one of his former students<br>was starting a a lab at his research<br>institute um at um in La Hoya California<br>and so I got in contact UM and we made<br>the call to shift to San Diego in<br>California um which if you're not aware<br>that where that is it's right on the<br>Mexican border in Southern California so<br>it's not unpleasant um so this picture<br>here is my actual commute to work um so<br>I would come under the bridge here and<br>then bike along and then through the<br>state park up that hill um it was<br>sometimes there was traffic on that road<br>that was slowing down because people was<br>looking at the whales that were coming<br>going along the coast um but this was<br>this going up that hill was quite useful<br>because I was eating every burrito in<br>site um and so the when I first signed<br>on to go and work for Stefan um it was<br>actually called the Burnham Medical<br>Research Institute um but in the first<br>month that I was there so in January<br>2010 um we had a visitor in the<br>cafeteria um so you might recognize that<br>person on the right is Arnold<br>sweger who was then the um governor of<br>California he came along to our<br>Institute because um a person called<br>Denny Sanford who is one of those rich<br>white guys there<br>um he the other the other one is me<br>Burnham I'm not I got them mixed up um<br>so he had decided Denny sford had<br>decided to give $50 million to The<br>Institute and so they were changing the<br>name and this this is really a<br>euramerican now moment Arnold SWS<br>thinkers at work and someone's just<br>dropping $50 million on your Institute<br>um<br>so this was a really um yeah it was I<br>just had a great time scientifically um<br>at Sanford Burnham um but I wasn't<br>working on you but couldn't anymore so I<br>was working on a different modification<br>to proteins um called phosphorilation<br>and so um we were collaborating with a<br>researcher called Elena pasquali who was<br>a researcher in breast cancer um who had<br>discovered a family of proteins that are<br>involved in resistance to anti-estrogen<br>therapy so anti uh often with breast<br>cancer it relies on estrogen Esten for<br>growth and so you want to block the<br>estrogen signaling um and she discovered<br>a family of proteins that are related to<br>this other modification called<br>phosphorilation which changes um<br>proteins function um when it goes on and<br>so we were trying to work out how these<br>um proteins actually worked um and as um<br>Lisa said I was able to get a um<br>Fellowship Fellowship from the US Army<br>so it was nice to some of that money to<br>go to good<br>use um so what we were able to do is<br>solve the structure of two proteins that<br>um are called breast cancer<br>anti-estrogen resistance proteins so we<br>call them b car proteins so when a cell<br>has high levels of these B proteins<br>those cells are resistant to<br>anti-estrogen therapies because for<br>reasons that were not really understood<br>at that time um our structure which is<br>shown there or one of one of the<br>structures we solved of these proteins<br>actually showed that um two of these<br>proteins which um can cause resistance<br>to antiestrogen therapies they actually<br>bound to other in quite a unique way so<br>this interaction hadn't really been seen<br>before the nature of that interaction um<br>and even more importantly once we<br>knocked out well made mutations at that<br>interface between these two proteins<br>which linked two signaling Pathways um<br>that firstly Stop Those cells from<br>migrating so much um so that's a good<br>thing when you're not wanting your<br>cancer cells to migrate around um and<br>also when we make mut mutations at that<br>interface that stops the cells from<br>being able to survive in anti-estrogen<br>therapy so the the wild type cells if<br>you overexpress those proteins then they<br>can survive in anti-estrogen treatment<br>but if you if they can't talk those two<br>proteins can't talk to each other the<br>anti-estrogen survival uh the<br>anti-estrogens go back to killing the<br>cell so that's a good thing um so we<br>provide a new understanding on these<br>proteins I was also working on um<br>another um family of proteins called map<br>kinases and so if you've done a biology<br>course map kyes are kind of the<br>classical um kisee signaling pathway um<br>so kinases are the protein that actually<br>put on those phosphorilation marks onto<br>proteins and it's a really canonical<br>signal for proliferation of cells um the<br>map K signaling pathway so we solved a<br>structure of irk 2 bound to a natural<br>inhibitor of that KK 2<br>protein um and so we could see how the<br>the kise was blocked um and we could see<br>it basically had two different ways that<br>it interacted with the kise it had a<br>little peptide down in this part of the<br>protein and then a larger that blocked<br>where substrates would bind um later on<br>uh Bernard lenberg who followed up from<br>some of the work that I did what they<br>did is actually M um linked that peptide<br>to a small molecule inhibitor of that<br>kyos and turned it into really quite an<br>effective inhibitor of um map kinases<br>the trouble is that that inhibitor<br>turned out to inhibit lots of map<br>kinases so we didn't get the specificity<br>that we wanted but it um showed the<br>principle so things had been going um<br>pretty well obviously um I but I'd been<br>a postto for kind of going on 6 and a<br>half years and so the opportunity<br>came at the time<br>yeah um to come uh to apply for this<br>Rutherford um Discovery Fellowship so<br>this was an opportunity to come back to<br>New Zealand and when I wrote um that<br>application um what I did was um<br>basically I said I was going to work on<br>proteins that are um involved in those<br>two modifications that I work on<br>ubiquination and phosphorilation which<br>is actually kind of canny because that's<br>pretty much all protein so I can pretty<br>much work on whatever proteins I wanted<br>um so we packed up our life in<br>California um Nell couldn't go to the go<br>on the swings at 7:00 at night in the<br>sun warm sunshine anymore um Gabrielle<br>came back to New Zealand a little bit<br>before me because she had to fly in the<br>last week that she was allowed to when<br>she was pregnant um but I got back in<br>time for Rita to be born um this photo<br>here is it looks like I've got jordas<br>rather than the baby but this is just<br>the fact that I've just got my<br>California Tan still on um but my raford<br>fellowship allowed me to come back once<br>I started getting some additional<br>funding I was able to um establish uh a<br>really core group um of people um who<br>have basically been with the lab since<br>so this is um Sam Jameson who's in the<br>audience he's turning a manual coffee<br>grinder into a automatic one with a<br>power drill<br>there um and Abby who doesn't do stupid<br>that um so both Sam and Abby are still<br>in the lab and keep um keep us in line<br>now so we've worked on too many proteins<br>over the my attention span is bad so<br>we've worked on too many um different<br>proteins so I'm really just want to<br>highlight three<br>examples um thinking about how certain<br>signaling Pathways function um how<br>proteins can be protein function be<br>disrupted in disease and how we could<br>might potentially be able to um modify<br>that protein Behavior so the first<br>example is thinking about activation of<br>cellular stress Pathways so um these<br>kinases which I've already talked about<br>they don't just signal for proliferation<br>they can signal um for cell death so<br>they can if there's a stressful<br>situation um or a toxin or something in<br>your cell they can there's different<br>Pathways that can get triggered and that<br>we can work that in our favor um and so<br>there's a bunch of different chem drugs<br>which actually affect how microtubules<br>within our cells um function and so<br>microtubules are basically like the<br>sceleton of our cells um but if we put<br>um toxins like um natural products from<br>this there's a flower called a<br>Madagascar Periwinkle um chemotherapy<br>agents like Vin blasting what they cause<br>is these big curvatures in our<br>microtubules and so what um pav Philip<br>did in the lab he worked out that there<br>was a stress activated kise which has a<br>domain which binds specifically to the<br>curved ends of these microtubules um and<br>that actually turned out to be that<br>triggered this Cascade which led to cell<br>death and so that told us why these<br>chemotherapies which have been in you uh<br>in use for decades and decades um that<br>was a link between those kinases and<br>that chemotherapy so it was kind of<br>explaining a a a a therapy that's been<br>used a while for quite a while and Alex<br>BS in the lab is I'm still continuing to<br>work on that um and try and understand<br>the mechanism further so we've worked<br>other um stress regulated kyes as well<br>and so a lot of this has been in<br>collaboration with Liz Ledgerwood um<br>we've been working on um apotosis signal<br>regulating kyes so that's that process<br>of cell death um and I already wanted to<br>work on apotosis Signal regulating<br>kinases when I was coming back and then<br>it turned out my office was next door to<br>Liz and we were sharing a lab space so<br>we've um co-supervised several students<br>who have been looking at that um<br>basically looking at how these kazes<br>form larger um complexes within cells<br>and similarly that allows them to<br>trigger cell death or inflammation in<br>response to either viral infection or<br>different types of um toxic stresses<br>that cells might<br>find so the next example is thinking<br>about um understanding um how proteins<br>get um their function is disrupted uh<br>during cancer and so this example is<br>thinking about not ubiqutin going on not<br>ubiqutin going onto molecules but<br>actually taking ubiqutin off molecules<br>we worked on a protein called one and so<br>what that does is it Cleaves ubiqutin<br>off um proteins called histones and<br>histones are how DNA is packed<br>efficiently um within the nucleus of<br>your cells um and if you have<br>efficiently packed DNA wrapped around<br>these histones it's Compact and it has<br>this histone modification on it what Bap<br>one comes along and does is it Snips<br>this ubiqutin off and so the the<br>nucleosomes start to unravel the DNA<br>opens up and the genes can be um<br>expressed more effectively um so Martina<br>Fogo when she was in the lab and I think<br>um might be watching online um she was<br>able to solve the structure of an<br>orthologue of Bap one um and see it how<br>it bound to an activating protein called<br>asxl and so it turned out that this<br>green protein is not Bap one that's<br>another protein that comes along and<br>activates Bap one um y the yellow<br>protein is B one and so these two<br>proteins together they both recognize<br>uin so the activator protein is re ired<br>to bind to that<br>ubiquit where that becomes relevant to<br>disease is um mutations in Bap one make<br>people really susceptible to various<br>different tumors but especially a type<br>of cancer called mesothelioma which is<br>what people get who are exposed to high<br>levels of<br>asbestos um and so when we map mutations<br>and Bap one onto the structure that we'd<br>solved um so basically if it gets a<br>color or gets fat the the protein<br>structure there that's mapping on to um<br>that's mapping hotpots of mutations that<br>have been seen in actual patients tumors<br>um what we can see in that they are all<br>basically mapped around the ubiquit and<br>binding site so we could see how the<br>function of Bap one is disrupted um in<br>patients that makes them more<br>susceptible um to uh disease and it's<br>because it's basically controlling the<br>packaging of<br>DNA the third example um which I'm going<br>to touch on is um it's probably the<br>longest running uh project in the lab um<br>and it's just because it's got the best<br>name which is the tribles proteins um so<br>tribles were named after um these small<br>Fury creatures which are seen on the on<br>the left um there they've got kind of a<br>cult following you can just about um<br>find any type of tribles paraphernalia<br>online because Star Trek people like<br>those sort of things um but what tribles<br>proteins are they are A protein that<br>looks like a kise so they look like A<br>protein that will trans transer that<br>phosphate modification but they've got<br>special changes in their active site<br>which mean that they um they can't<br>transfer phosphate anymore instead what<br>they do is they help the transfer of<br>ubiqutin onto substrate so it's<br>something these are our two favorite<br>modifications in the lab um and it it<br>looks like something that should<br>transfer phosphate but it's helping to<br>transfer um ubiquit so it's really<br>masquerading as something else U much<br>like um our friend Suki is over there um<br>so this um is very relevant to disease<br>and so there's lots of these things<br>called pseudokinases which it's it's<br>quite an active area of research um we<br>collaborate a lot with James Murphy at<br>the Welter and elizer Hall Institute in<br>Melbourne um looking at how these<br>pseudokinase proteins these things that<br>look like Pudo kinases but aren't quite<br>um might be able to be targeted um in<br>disease so how trebles function is they<br>have an extra kind of tail on them as<br>well as their pseudokinase domain which<br>binds to a ubiquit and transferring<br>protein and so it brings together this<br>ubiquit and transferring protein um with<br>substrates and so tribl spine to the<br>substrates um it brings along the<br>ubiquit and transferring protein which<br>has a ring domain that we talked about<br>earlier um that builds chains and causes<br>degradation of those substrates so it's<br>really a scaffold protein that brings<br>together um those two types of proteins<br>what those substrates are uh<br>transcription factors which control<br>expression of a whole lot of genes and<br>so particularly genes that are involved<br>in immune cell differentiation so our<br>immune cells and also regulation of<br>metabolism um what that means um<br>practically is if you have two higher<br>levels of Tribbles proteins that causes<br>too much degradation of these<br>transcription factors and that can<br>actually lead to acute myoid glucemia<br>and so this was a discovery that was<br>made quite a while ago um by people who<br>we Kenan who we now collaborate with um<br>in<br>Glasgow so as I said we've been working<br>on tribles for quite some time so what<br>it means is we've solved quite a few<br>different structures of a protein called<br>Tri one um and the main thing that's<br>shown shown us is it has lots of<br>different confirmations um which it can<br>um change between and that depends on<br>whether it's binding to a substrate or<br>not binding to a substrate um that's<br>linked to its ability to bind to this<br>ubiqutin transferring<br>protein um the details of that don't<br>really matter um although it's been so<br>quite a lot of effort from Sam to those<br>different structures the details will<br>matter in the end um but what find<br>solving those structures mean is that we<br>know changes in that big pocket in the<br>middle of the protein if we can block up<br>the changes between those different<br>confirmations we might be able to<br>inhibit um tribles protein function and<br>so ultimately what what we're doing now<br>is working with um both researchers<br>atago um and collaborators overseas to<br>drone develop small molecules that will<br>sit in the middle of that protein and be<br>able to affect its function change the<br>cycle of um um confirmations that<br>tribles can actually<br>obtain so that's the the taste of the<br>type of research that we've had going on<br>in the lab what I want to spend the last<br>five minutes doing is just touching on<br>um what where we're looking forward and<br>I swear I didn't know the third<br>Terminator movie was called rise of the<br>Machines when I made the title I found<br>that out afterwards um so thinking about<br>how things have changed massively in the<br>last kind of five years or so so our<br>pipeline um the first major change has<br>been there's been massive technological<br>advances in electr microscopes which<br>mean um many many more proteins can be<br>basically directly visualized with an<br>electr microscope rather than having to<br>go through this process of growing<br>crystals and so we're pretty actively<br>trying to uh get into this area so we've<br>solved some um structures by C now um<br>the difficulty here is we don't really<br>have a microscope well we don't have a<br>microscope in New Zealand that can solve<br>these type of structures that we need to<br>so we're working a whole lot with<br>collaborators in Australia but there's<br>all sorts of logistical um difficulties<br>that that raises but not All Is Lost um<br>because the other major advancement<br>that's happened even more recently than<br>um cryo em advances um is AI has um<br>really massively changed how we can look<br>at protein structures and so all of this<br>is actually built on the fact that when<br>you solve a protein structure you have<br>to publicly deposit it in a database<br>where there's 200,000 PhD students who<br>have solved the structure they're not<br>all PhD students but that's goes into<br>the public domain um and then Deep Mind<br>a company which is owned by Google um<br>what they've developed is a um AI called<br>Alpha fold which is really really<br>amazing at predicting threedimensional<br>structures of proteins and so um Peter<br>Deon my head of Department likes to joke<br>about how we're all going to be<br>redundant um our structural biologists<br>um but I think it's fair to say that we<br>are structural biologists are running a<br>lot more Alpha fold that anyone else um<br>we are all over this because it's just<br>amazing and it's massively changing the<br>questions we can ask um so out of our<br>latest paper we're interrogating this<br>protein complex which has got about 12<br>different components because we can now<br>do that um and to loop back to the start<br>of my talk and so this is the growth<br>factor complex bound to two different<br>receptors from<br>um from the Sheep ovary which is<br>actually those proteins are exactly the<br>same in humans so they're the same as<br>human growth factors so this protein<br>structure it's a high confidence model<br>um Alpha fold took 5 minutes to Output<br>that um I took three years to solve the<br>structure of that green protein but that<br>means we can then take that knowledge<br>and work with those if we can make those<br>proteins we still need we still need to<br>be able to make those proteins to be<br>able to change their function and study<br>how Pro other molecules might um work<br>with that<br>so I think this headline might be more<br>accurate<br>Peter AI may not steal many jobs after<br>all it may just make workers more<br>efficient um and then what I think is<br>the next Frontier is not just working on<br>proteins that a are existing in nature<br>but we're um actively looking at trying<br>to develop synthetic proteins that can<br>change protein function um and so we've<br>worked uh we're on making these proteins<br>called nanobodies which uh they actually<br>designed based on um antibodies from<br>llamas and camels um but the next<br>Frontier is going to be completely novel<br>proteins um that we can use um programs<br>like Alpha fold to dream up these<br>proteins to change um protein function<br>so this's going to be a really exciting<br>new area of development so basically<br>everything's changing all the time super<br>fast in structural biology at the<br>moment so that brings me to thank um all<br>the people who helped me to get here um<br>I have had really supportive HDs<br>including Peter but all of all of the<br>HDs since I've come back um I've had<br>four different HDs and they've all been<br>super supportive in different ways but I<br>really want to acknowledge these people<br>who are examples of why I think Oto is<br>an amazing place to be um it's so

have around the world and around<br>New Zealand um which have made it really<br>fun and of course um the people who have<br>paid the bills um and then most<br>importantly um so thanking my family so<br>my parents who have been so supportive<br>over the years um always being<br>interested in how Grant rounds are going<br>even when I don't want to talk about<br>them um but my um siblings who uh don't<br>make me talk about Grant rounds but are<br>also supportive um and of course uh my<br>family um Gabrielle and the girls and<br>Margaret um for putting up with me um<br>being away or away away physically or<br>away um in the fa in the fairies with my<br>mind um but your support has been um<br>really integral to getting here so thank<br>you very much all for listening<br>the<br>Co Peter D T so my name is Peter D I am<br>the head of Department of biochemistry<br>which is the department that is<br>privileged to host Peter mace um thank<br>you all for coming these occasions are<br>really important to us that's why we<br>dress up in these frankly stupid outfits<br>um but uh particularly great to see so<br>many of my colleagues from biochemistry<br>and some of my ex-colleagues from<br>biochemistry um uh people from the<br>University and of course uh Peter's fun<br>out it is delightful to see you here and<br>it's one of these rare occasions where<br>we get to to reach into people's<br>families and say look actually we value<br>this person and that's an important<br>thing um The W you just heard for which<br>I thank my colleagues hugely I think<br>they've been working really hard in<br>secret uh for that wer um it talks about<br>stitching together weaving together and<br>bringing together and it's a perfect<br>reflection of the talk that we've just<br>heard cells signaling uh which Peter was<br>talking about weaves together together<br>organisms turning them from single cells<br>into multicellular<br>communities Peter's research touches<br>this key aspect of biology um it's how<br>cells communicate how they pass<br>information and how they react to their<br>environment and um my my discipline is<br>developmental biology and I think that<br>cells signaling the way that cells talk<br>to each other is the most fascinating<br>and most important way in in which uh we<br>can understand uh<br>biology Peter shows us uh how these<br>proteins uh act to keep our<br>multicellular communities healthy and<br>how they might be manipulated to change<br>biology to improve health and well-being<br>and I think those are quite remarkable<br>things this stitching together of<br>biology has Peter showed us from the<br>molecular to the personal all the way<br>from the tiniest atoms on these proteins<br>to cancers uh and and diseases that that<br>need to be uh treated um that's<br>remarkable the scale of this is dizzying<br>It's hard to sit in this room and not be<br>impressed by somebody who can point to<br>an atom on a molecule and say that's the<br>problem that's what we need to stop<br>that's what we need to change and I<br>think we all should to and an amazing<br>Act of scientific bravery and<br>Imagination to be able to say from this<br>diagram we can understand better how to<br>treat people the shape of the molecular<br>components affecting cells tissues and<br>organisms our environment are so crucial<br>that they affect everything about us<br>They affect the way we work the way we<br>look the way we are the way we interact<br>with our communities I think it's best<br>put by William Blake who says to see the<br>world in a grain of sand though in this<br>case to see the world in a protein<br>Crystal the the variation of the shapes<br>of these tiny proteins can can affect so<br>much the world is astonishing more than<br>this to be a little controversial<br>Peter's work tells us of what goes wrong<br>when Communications fail when messages<br>aren't listened to when the smaller<br>signals are not responded to and I think<br>this is a lesson we should all take not<br>just in understanding cells but in our<br>Communications and in our society the<br>university otago I dare say could do<br>components Peter mace now Professor<br>Peter mace manages to weave together an<br>outstanding uh being an outstanding<br>world-class researcher an aspiring<br>teacher and frankly a damn good<br>colleague Peter I am honored<br>uh to be able to work alongside you I<br>thank you for your work in our<br>department for your work in science<br>which I think is changing the frontiers<br>of biology and of course for tonight's<br>lecture thank you so<br>much oh H korot Megan G toena I am the<br>pro Vice Chancellor of Health Sciences<br>and I get to have the final work tonight<br>and at this time of the year it's really<br>important that we think about uh the<br>university as a whole so glad that Peter<br>did and raised that but um Peter mace I<br>am glad to hear that you're<br>collaborating around electrom microscope<br>because we can't afford one um and uh<br>like your parents I'm interested in how<br>the grant is going as well so um we will<br>keep tabs on that um but honestly<br>congratulations on an amazing career so<br>far and we look forward to seeing what<br>the next steps are as well<br>um some pretty impressive science there<br>um it brought back memories of my time<br>at University and having to remember all<br>those different names um so I apologies<br>to the bakim students there is a lot to<br>learn and remember um and my final word<br>tonight is to invite you all to join us<br>at the staff Club so that we can<br>celebrate uh the inaugural professorial<br>lecture of Professor Peter mice</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
