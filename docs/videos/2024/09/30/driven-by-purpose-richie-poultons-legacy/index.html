My primary<br>purpose is to do insightful research<br>about the human condition and then to<br>translate or transfer those insights<br>into initiatives that act upon people's<br>lives to make them better, so anything<br>short of that total package is only half<br>the<br>deal. Kia ora, I'm Richie Poulton, the director<br>of the Dunedin Longitudinal Study, I've<br>been involved in the project since<br>1985 when I first interviewed at age 13,<br>or the age 13 assessment of the study<br>members, I became deputy director in 1995<br>and took over from Phil Silva in the year<br>2000, so I've been in this role for<br>the last 23, 24 years. Dad was always<br>asking me, what do you want to do when<br>you grow up, from childhood to being a<br>young adult he was determined to start<br>me thinking about living a purposeful<br>life and he imparted in me his innate<br>quality of being curious. I was always<br>curious, I was always wondering about stuff as<br>a child and I was quite<br>thoughtful<br>and asked annoying questions often<br>of adults as to the whys and <br>wherefores of life and adults were a foreign<br>country to me as a child, they did things<br>that made me question, their motives<br>my own friendships,<br>it's garden variety stuff, some that<br>went wrong made me question, my<br>growing awareness of inequity and<br>prejudice at secondary school made me<br>question, I was I suppose I was a bit<br>of a bore really, I was very questioning<br>and kept on wanting to know the answers,<br>so it was inevitable I suppose I would<br>end up studying human beings<br>somehow and I just got a plum job as it<br>turned<br>out. Besides his desire to make a<br>positive difference, Dad also had a big<br>love for sport, it wasn't uncommon for<br>his secondary school teacher former All<br>Blacks coach Sir Graham Henry to pop<br>around and watch the<br>footy. Oh Richie was a very good sportsman<br>like he was an outstanding cricketer, I<br>personally think it was a better<br>cricketer than rugby player, he thought<br>it the<br>opposite, he played with Martin Crowe<br>and Mark Greatbatch in the first 11 at<br>Auckland Grammar school, was Captain in<br>1980, technically superb you know. I was<br>a notable Sportsman I believe, I<br>I've got all the achievements to show<br>for it at least. I was first 11 first 15<br>at Auckland Grammar and I was probably<br>headed for a sports career but I<br>decided by the time university began<br>that that wasn't of<br>interest, it wasn't because I decided<br>that academic work was of interest, I<br>decided that having a good time was of<br>primary interest and then halfway<br>through my university career at the year<br>three stage I suppose, I matured a bit<br>and decided to settle down and focus on<br>work. First of all it led me to clinical<br>psych, I realised two or 3 years into<br>doing that, that I wasn't cut out to do<br>that forever,<br>uh was just too emotionally<br>taxing, so I reverted to academia and<br>um did a PhD. In academia, how good you<br>are is measured by something called an H<br>Index and Dad had a high H Index an H<br>Index is measured by two things, firstly<br>the number of publications put out and<br>secondly, the number of times those<br>publications have been cited.<br>If someone has a H Index of 10 it means<br>they've published at least 10 papers and<br>each of those papers have been cited at<br>least 10 times, Dad's PhD supervisor<br>professor Gavin Andrews highlights Dad's<br>academic prowess and his exceptional H<br>Index. Richie's position in the world of<br>academia, oh look it is high. His H Index<br>is 139 this morning, which is really very<br>very high, uh it ranks well, 139 H Index if<br>you're 90 is not bad, it's still very<br>good, but he was only 60 and that is just<br>phenomenal, what's most surprising is his<br>M index where you control for the number<br>of years he's been publishing, his M<br>Index is four at two you can get a job<br>at said anywhere in the world is an<br>academic with a one or four he could get<br>a job at Harvard. And then with good luck and a<br>confluence of influences and events led<br>me to The Dunedin Study or came<br>back to The Dunedin Study and that's<br>really been the luckiest break I've<br>had. The Study began in the early<br>1970s and it was particularly interested<br>in understanding whether baby's born in<br>adverse circumstances, who in the past would<br>have died quite frankly, but we're now<br>living because of the increased<br>sophistication of birth technologies in<br>the 60s, whether they were faring as<br>well as their counterparts who weren't<br>born in adverse circumstances. Two<br>assessments were planned, we had<br>perinatal data on this general<br>population sample, so was<br>unselected, at age three we did a<br>follow-up and at age five the school<br>starting age we assessed them again.<br>Phil Silva and his group of researchers<br>discovered a lot of hitherto<br>unrecognised problems at that time and<br>it created a sort of a child health<br>shock, I remember the banners, we've<br>got tucked away from the Evening Post<br>and the like and that was parlayed I think<br>at the time until a further six years<br>of funding, they wanted to understand<br>whether these children who weren't<br>starting from the start line they were way<br>behind, were fairing as well uh as their<br>counterparts through the school years. By<br>age 13 The Study had established its<br>reputation in New Zealand as a very<br>good study of human development or child<br>development as it was, through the adolescent <br>years the focus of assessments<br>broadened, from just school or just<br>behaviour or just emotional<br>development to include a whole lot of<br>other disciplines and areas of focus,<br>talking oral health, respiratory health,<br>cardiovascular health,<br>psychosocial well-being which is a very<br>broad area, employment outcomes or<br>educational outcomes, moving through to<br>employment in the later adolescent years,<br>whether you parenting, what your intimate<br>relationships were, whether you're<br>antisocial, the list goes on and on and<br>on, at our most recent assessment, at age<br>45 we were able to conduct an<br>assessment of 18 biomarkers and with<br>that data we were able to<br>characterise our study members who are<br>chronologically all the same age, they<br>were born in one single year, general<br>population<br>sample and characterise them in terms of<br>their biological aging, so we hypothesise<br>that you start aging, very much from the<br>get-go and the rate at which you<br>experience interrelated, across multiple<br>organ systems deterioration, that's your<br>biological age, we hypothesise that there will be<br>individual differences in that, so we<br>came up with an algorithm that said this<br>is your pace of aging, some people were<br>on time, so they chronologically had<br>lived 45 years and biologically they<br>look<br>45, but then the extremes on both<br>sides of 45 were quite stark and some<br>people<br>were the equivalent of 28 or 29 and<br>at the other end some people were in the<br>early 70s biologically, um that's<br>important because those people who are<br>aging rapidly or faster than you<br>would expect are the people who are most<br>at risk of developing a whole bunch<br>of non-communicable diseases such as<br>heart disease, cancer, diabetes and<br>so forth. Dad wanted to compliment the work<br>done on human development in the Dunedin<br>Study by adding to that a number of<br>intervention studies, these studies are<br>informed by the findings that have<br>originated from half a century of<br>research, the aim is for these studies to<br>be harnessed by government and NGOs to<br>better the lives of all New Zealanders.<br>So we're got 50 years of gold<br>standard longitude research, mapping<br>people's trajectory through life, sorting<br>out the reasons and the causes for<br>ending up on the wrong side of the<br>odds in all sorts of ways, up until now<br>we've not taken it seriously in terms of<br>focusing on what interventions can work.<br>So we are doing one study of Māori early<br>childhood education, it's immersion Te Reo<br>completely speaking Māori in the<br>centre and we identified in pilot<br>studies four new constructs, there's never<br>been work like this before and we're<br>hypothesising that this will give Māori<br>students a better start at<br>life, simple as<br>that, it's about equity it's about<br>fairness about just bloody doing the<br>right thing. Richie and I met and<br>identified four strength-based Māori<br>constructs that if we put those together<br>That would amount to the<br>self-control that Richie was talking<br>about. The first<br>construct is tuakiri, tuakiri is a<br>secure local Māori<br>identity, that is language<br>culture,<br>confidence in oneself and one's culture<br>and who they are, the next construct<br>is whānauranga, whānauranga is about the construct of<br>whānau which is the roles and<br>responsibilities in being part of a whānau and<br>I'm talking about children and their<br>parents, if they have that in place<br>that's so rich and so strong, so solid<br>for a child to have that, to know who<br>they are, what their role is, what they<br>need to do and be. The third one is<br>manawaroa, manawaroa would be the most similar to<br>the western construct of self-control, so<br>manawaroa is about persevering about<br>determination and also a positive<br>outlook, it's about problem<br>solving, understanding that there are<br>ways of resolving issues, of problem<br>solving and persevering despite<br>difficulty and adversity, which from a<br>Māori perspective adversity historically<br>the loss has been great, so a child that<br>displays<br>manawaroa is a wonderful thing, and the last<br>one is piripono<br>piripono is<br>integrity,<br>commitment and<br>responsibility, we believe that if those<br>four constructs are in place, tamariki who<br>graduate<br>from Te Kōpae Piripono, have their<br>kete full of<br>richness that then what we describe is<br>as<br>hākoakoa which is confidence, that quiet<br>strength, sometimes loud strength, um that<br>carries them and is the foundation for<br>tamariki throughout their lives, the<br>outcomes of the feasibility study found<br>significant change across all of the<br>constructs, Māori constructs and<br>self-control, the tamariki grew in all of<br>those constructs<br>over time, which is unbelievably exciting<br>to know that it's making a<br>difference. The second project, Kia Tīmata Pai,<br>there's 400 controls, business as<br>usual, 400 getting a condition called the<br>Engage program or intervention which is<br>about strengthening<br>self-control, 400 that will get language<br>acquisitions and then finally, we're<br>going to be doing work with a group that<br>receives both self-control<br>and language acquisition intervention.<br>So Engage takes this very simple<br>very accessible approach to developing<br>these skills in the preschool years, we<br>get this amazing developmental window<br>where our brains are really malleable,<br>where positive practice at these skills<br>is really transformational, some of the<br>great activities are things like yoga<br>and there's a game called animal speeds,<br>and if a teacher yells out turtle you've<br>got to go about in a turtlish way, you've got<br>be slow, you've got to be deliberate, and<br>then if the teacher yells out cheetah<br>we're going bang, we're going to run<br>around quickly and the game or the<br>activity, is just, it's a fun simple<br>activity where you're switching between<br>fast medium and slow and you're<br>learning that skill of being able to<br>regulate your emotions but also how to<br>behave and move safely around others and<br>so, it's targeting some emotional<br>regulation skills, it's targeting some<br>behavioural regulation skills, you're also<br>having to listen and remember what the<br>instruction was, so the some attention<br>and memory skills in there too. We want<br>to show really clearly what's changed<br>since before they did Engage and<br>what's after, so what we know we need to<br>see, is we need to see improvements in<br>those emotional regulation skills, can<br>you manage those strong feelings can you<br>can you be more comfortable with what's<br>happening emotionally, can we see<br>improvement in those cognitive skills, so<br>your attention your memory, the air traffic<br>control centre in your brain, are we<br>seeing some improvements there, and<br>then behaviourally, are we seeing those<br>social improvements, the ability to<br>resist temptations and delay<br>gratification and all of those<br>skills, as we measure that very clearly<br>we use we use rating scales, we use a<br>whole lot of different assessment<br>techniques, to be able to really pinpoint<br>what was the change and what was it that<br>helped cause that change, so which games<br>which techniques which new skills that<br>parents or teachers have now acquired<br>because of this program. One of the<br>engaged activities that we did is the<br>think or say it game, if I gave them a<br>prompt and if it was something they<br>thought they should think, they went to<br>one side of the room and something they<br>thought they should say, they went to the<br>other side of the room and so we've<br>worked on that a way bit in our<br>classroom and I have actually heard the<br>children use it during their play,<br>somebody will say something to their<br>friends and they're like that's<br>something you should think, which is<br>really cool so it's amazing how<br>quickly they soak up all that learning<br>and use it themselves. Realistically we<br>only get one shot of this, we only get<br>one shot in our life course of having<br>this really big transformational change,<br>so, you know we take that really<br>seriously and and what's exciting now, is<br>you know our government is taking that<br>seriously by funding this type of work<br>and all of that again traces back to the<br>fact that you've got people like<br>Richie and The Dunedin Study that are<br>getting serious about evidence and<br>getting it into the world.<br>[Children talking]<br>So the oral language program is<br>called Enrich and in helping children's<br>oral language, it's helping them<br>to communicate their needs and wants and<br>desires to other people and that's going<br>to help them to manage their behaviour,<br>which is a very important aspect of<br>self-regulation. The children's teachers<br>we're teaching them techniques to engage<br>in more of what we call serve and<br>return interactions with the children,<br>the child might be looking at an object<br>or pointing at a ball and the teacher<br>responds by saying "ball you're looking<br>at a purple ball, do you want the ball?"<br>and these everyday interactions with<br>children are incredibly helpful for<br>their communication and their<br>development. The difference that I've<br>seen in one of the children that I care<br>for is the language that's taken off.<br>I've noticed in the last couple of<br>months, is that he's just saying lots and<br>lots of words, he's just doing so much<br>more and he's joining in things, whereas<br>before he would be hesitant and he'd<br>just want to watch and look, he wants to<br>come and join in and he's talking a lot<br>more and I think the Enrich and Engage<br>has definitely helped and provided a lot<br>of extension for him in that respect.<br>Reading fiction<br>specifically, is helping all of us, not<br>just children in adolescence but as<br>adults, it helps us to feel more empathy<br>for other people and even to engage<br>in more pro-social<br>behaviour, so we're hoping to instil a<br>love of read fiction from a a very<br>early age in these<br>children. And finally, I'm on the board of<br>a major NGO called the Wise Group and I<br>persuaded the board to invest in a<br>digital mental health initiative, it was<br>rolled out during covid for free, to the<br>population, mental health is a major<br>issue in this country, as you know. The<br>Wise Group is one of the largest NGOs<br>in Aotearoa New Zealand and we provide<br>services in the community around mental<br>health addiction and well-being. So one<br>of the things people might not know<br>about Richie and the Wise Group is just<br>how broad his influence has been on the<br>group, he's been you know, a key leader<br>and player in online CBT therapy with<br>Just A Thought. Just A Thought started<br>because Richie Poulton had a vision, he knew<br>that CBT was really effective but that<br>it was difficult to reach people and he<br>knew that online CBT was just as<br>effective as face to face therapy and so<br>with that vision, then created Just A<br>Thought. The Dunedin Study has identified<br>the amount of challenges that all human<br>beings experience at some stage or<br>another over our lifespan and the need<br>for us to really get ahead of that to<br>try and support people and and families<br>and communities<br>to uh live a better quality of life and<br>have access to better levels of<br>well-being. CBT or Cognitive Behavioural<br>Therapy is a psychological approach that<br>teaches us how to understand the<br>importance of our thoughts and how we<br>perceive things and the impact that has<br>on how we feel, the emotional responses<br>and the physiological responses that we<br>have and what in turn we do in<br>situations and of course that then<br>allows us to explore whether or not our<br>thoughts are accurate and helpful and<br>our behaviours are helpful or whether or<br>not there are other ways that we can<br>look at things and respond that may get<br>us closer to where we want to be in life.<br>The courses are designed in a beautiful<br>way and it's through engagement in a<br>story, so the content is taught initially<br>through almost like a lived experience<br>story of people that have had the<br>challenges and it follows their journey<br>through exploring what's happening with<br>them and uncovering the knowledge and<br>the skills with a therapist of what they<br>need to know to to improve where<br>they're at, after the stories are<br>lessons and they help our users to dig<br>in and to really uncover their own<br>changes that they need to make<br>and how it resonates with their own life<br>and challenges. We've been lucky enough<br>with obviously Richie being one of the<br>key people that really helped to bring<br>Just A Thought into being to work<br>with him later down the line and<br>the team at The Dunedin Study to explore<br>our first efficacy study looking at<br>our first 20,000 users through Just A Thought.<br>What we were able to find is<br>that it's incredibly effective, we found<br>that as people work through the<br>different lessons and each course and<br>there's approximately six lessons, they<br>get better and that is a significant<br>building effect or improvement that<br>we see over time, we know that just like<br>face to face CBT people don't need<br>necessarily to engage in a full package<br>of care or a succession course to<br>get the benefits and they use what they<br>need until they reach a point where<br>things are better. So<br>three insights or appetisers to the<br>future, I hope we continue down this vein<br>but before that, I hope we continue the<br>superb work that's got us to where we<br>are at 50 years,<br>we're all committed to it, the<br>next<br>phase<br>and there I leave<br>you, by saying thank you for coming,<br>everyone, every single person here, kia ora.<br>Tena koutou, ah ko Moana Theodor toku ingoa, my name is Moana Theodor and I'm the<br>new director of the Dunedin<br>Multidisciplinary Health and Development<br>Study known as The Dunedin Study. Working<br>with Richie has been one of the<br>highlights of my academic career, my work<br>life, I met him when I was 23 years old,<br>so I knew him for a period of about 25<br>years and so we had a long-term<br>relationship that changed and developed<br>over time but he was an<br>incredible academic an incredible<br>scientist as we know, you know world<br>leading, in terms of um his research and<br>his work, he was also a humanist, he<br>was deeply compassionate and caring<br>about people, caring about the people he<br>worked with, so his staff and his<br>colleagues and also incredibly caring<br>and compassionate when it came to<br>working with The Dunedin Study members, so<br>that was something he brought naturally<br>with him, but into that role around<br>having that compassion and care as a<br>scientist as a researcher when<br>working with each and every single study<br>member, each and every individual and<br>really valuing the<br>contributions and the gifts that they<br>would give to support the work<br>of The Study. The first thing I want to<br>show you is some work we've done on<br>something we call self-control and its<br>long-term impact. A key way<br>to remember Richie and his work, is to<br>ensure that the research that we do and<br>the work that we do here at The Dunedin<br>Study, is used to make a positive<br>difference to the lives of others out<br>there in society, to address those really<br>meaty complex issues around poverty<br>which Richie was so passionate about.<br>I will warn you now that if Mum doesn't<br>know where you are, I will breach you.<br>I get asked, how will I<br>continue Richie's legacy, but also<br>importantly how can I build upon and<br>extend that legacy as Richie would have<br>wanted, when him and I talked about me<br>taking the role as director of The<br>Dunedin Study, he talked first and<br>foremost about<br>values, and those values around<br>putting the needs of The Study members<br>first, and putting The Study first and<br>foremost as well. The Study is always<br>changing as we change and get older and<br>so for the<br>last couple of phases at age 38 and age<br>45 and now age 52, it's becoming a study<br>more and more focused on aging, so how do<br>people age and what helps to<br>support positive aging and what gets in<br>the way of positive aging and that's<br>the areas that we are more and more<br>focusing on and that's really important<br>in terms of thinking about for the next<br>generation, what can help provide support<br>so that others can, you know live those<br>long and healthy and fulfilling lives<br>into their old age, and how can we ensure<br>that that's done<br>equitably and how can we ensure that<br>we intervene or we look at prevention<br>as early as possible to make sure that<br>everyone has a chance, to age positively<br>and live those long fulfilling lives.<br>I truly look forward to seeing where The<br>Study goes, it's clearly a national<br>treasure, however for it to remain so, it<br>needs consistent international and<br>domestic<br>funding, thank you to the study members<br>who have and continue to give so much of<br>themselves to this taonga and thank you<br>to my dear Dad, what an amazing legacy<br>you have, you made people feel good and<br>you'll continue to do so as we hold on<br>to the words that you left us. Being<br>slightly philosophical and I tend not to be<br>too philosophical as a person, I tend<br>to just try and live for now than rather<br>than to philosophise, but I think my<br>philosophy of life, is to leave the world<br>a better place, if you can,<br>have fun along the way, don't hurt anyone,<br>is my philosophy of life<br>and  I'm pretty<br>satisfied, with how it's turned out.<br>The<br>hounds are<br>warring, the blood of love is<br>flowing, there's that sound<br>again, it's the sound of nothing but<br>pain. There's no such<br>thing, as a world without<br>you. Cause I will hold you up till the<br>end, way beyond your wildest dreams. So lay<br>down your<br>darkness, step into the<br>light. Lay down your<br>darkness, let that river go<br>Let that river go.<br>Hey you, you're running rings around the<br>world, it will run rings around us all.<br>It conspires to steal our soul,<br>just to watch us take a fall, so<br>lay down your<br>darkness, watch your dread explode,<br>lay down your<br>darkness, let that river go.<br>Let that river go<br>Hey, there's no such thing as a world without you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
