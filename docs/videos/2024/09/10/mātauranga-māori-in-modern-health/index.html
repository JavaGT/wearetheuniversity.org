The project called Te unaunahi i whakapiripiri ki te ika nui a Maui, explores the transformative power of community-led hauora wānanga using Te Tai Tokerau frames of reference including concepts like hohou te rongo, te unaunahi, te pou eke, te kauae runga and te kauae raro.<br> <br>Te unaunahi i whakapiripiri ki te ika nui a Maui will be based in the Hihiaua Cultural Centre in Whangārei Te Rerenga Paraoa.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the<br>uh<br>is uh conceptualized as the the kind of<br>M practices that enable us to practice<br>our own cultural ways of being um here<br>uh on Papu so it is things like the<br>practice of uh ra the practice of K way<br>uh wh<br>fansing and we're really interested in<br>in um but it also how those practices<br>and the learning of those practices can<br>elevate a person's sense of themselves<br>their identity their connection to Tay<br>more broadly and Beyond of course<br>inoa so we're looking at how the<br>learning of practical cultural ways of<br>being um enhance a person's sense of<br>ident<br>their sense of connectedness to<br>community and the ways those practices<br>actually help<br>to help to heal people help to heal<br>their farno their community and in this<br>project we plan to investigate a how<br>those learning practi how those learning<br>progressions happen uh what instigates<br>them what sustains that learning beyond<br>the one itself and two the impacts of<br>what is learned<br>the um on the ways they choose to live<br>beyond beyond the W in their Faro in<br>their community and perhaps importantly<br>the passing on of that M to um other<br>members of their family there's a need<br>for This research because much of the<br>work done in both the health and<br>education system are predicated on<br>Western knowledge Western ways of doing<br>Western ways of healing and what we know<br>through our engagement with he cultural<br>center and many of the mang from tto too<br>is that we actually hold many of the<br>solutions in our<br>help we heal themselves um so this<br>project is not only focused on what<br>happens in the W but also utilizing some<br>of our TI learning Frameworks things<br>that emerge from<br>Al um that teach us how people learn I'm<br>not sure I navigate the and the<br>purposefully intentionally in my every<br>day life but one of the things we're<br>learning about in our engagement with<br>manga from too is that um the Practical<br>things we learn here in the co that help<br>us to function in everyday life that<br>help us to work alongside others um in<br>our own cultural ways TI informed kind<br>of cultural practices actually do other<br>kinds of work unbeknownst to us most of<br>the time um in the KOA realm it's really<br>significant to um receive an HRC Grant<br>as a member of a cable faculty so<br>education and social work don't usually<br>receive HRC grants but I think and I'm<br>deeply grateful that the HRC um granting<br>panel<br>recognized the Way's educational<br>knowledge and what happens in the<br>education realm can be of use in health<br>education spaces as well because that's<br>what this project is doing and it's is<br>it's taking what we know about pedagogy<br>and about what works for young<br>people and we're thinking about how can<br>those learnings apply to the teaching of<br>School nurses and counselors and medical<br>professionals um how can the distinctive<br>ways that Mali learn about her be useful<br>for non-mi and or other upcoming Mali</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
