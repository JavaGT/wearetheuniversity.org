celebrate<br>the promotion of Mark lochman to<br>professor at the University of<br>atago these lectures are a wonderful<br>opportunity for us to come together and<br>listen to our new professors talk talk<br>about their personal Journeys their<br>research platform and the impact their<br>research has had on<br>others i' like to welcome colleagues<br>students and friends from across the<br>university and Beyond including those<br>joining us tonight by live<br>stream I would like to give a special<br>welcome to Mark's mother and siblings<br>who are joining us by Zoom all the way<br>from Canada and the Netherlands this<br>evening and to Mark's non-biological<br>mother noene gold who is with us tonight<br>in<br>person I'd also like to give a warm<br>welcome to mark PhD supervisor Prof<br>Professor Graham Young from the<br>University of Washington in the United<br>States of America who was also formerly<br>uh from the zoology program at atago<br>University finally I'd like to<br>acknowledge all of Mark's friends from<br>leth Valley Presbyterian church thank<br>you all for coming this<br>evening it's not easy to become a<br>professor at the University of<br>atago in order to be promoted to that<br>level candidates need to show that they<br>are outstanding in each of three areas<br>teaching research and<br>service Professor lochman has clearly<br>met these<br>criteria it's an honor and a privilege<br>to congratulate him tonight for that<br>outstanding achievement and I hope<br>you'll join me right now in doing the<br>same and I would be clapping very hard<br>if didn't have this microphone in my<br>together I hope you'll take every<br>opportunity to do much more of that this<br>evening Mark is a prolific researcher<br>having published hundreds of articles on<br>on Fish with a focus on the<br>eel tonight Mark will share a little bit<br>about his research into the mic<br>migration and spawning behavior of the<br>eel he will tell us about the role Liv<br>keto testosterone a testosterone like<br>hormone plays as a key contributor to<br>the eel's migration and<br>reproduction but Mark is not just a keen<br>researcher he has a keen interest in the<br>curriculum and how it serves our<br>students<br>Mark I cannot tell you how much I've<br>enjoyed hearing from you periodically<br>about the opportunities you have seen to<br>improve the way we teach and deliver our<br>courses your passion your student focus<br>and your willingness to question<br>long-established Traditions have been<br>both refreshing and helpful to me so<br>thank you very much uh for that<br>tonight Mark will not only discuss his<br>research he will also reflect on his<br>academic career to tell us a little bit<br>about his own personal<br>journey and about the impact his<br>research has had on the profession on<br>his teaching and most importantly on his<br>students but before he does that I'll<br>hand over to Professor Richard Blakey<br>Pro Vice Chancellor from the division of<br>Sciences to introduce professor lochman<br>and give you a little bit more detail<br>about his academic<br>background thank you<br>Richard Professor Brock ten Professor<br>lochman ten Professor Spencer ten<br>friends and colleagues ten aoto ten aoto<br>ten aoto<br>K it is my great pleasure to introduce<br>our speaker tonight Professor mark<br>lochman from the Department of zoology<br>to give his inaugural professorial<br>lecture here at the University of otago<br>as indicated by Professor Brock Mark was<br>promoted to Professor in February of<br>this year and tonight we celebrate this<br>significant achievement born in the<br>Netherlands Mark didn't share any place<br>names which I usually get and I think<br>that was to spare me the embarrassment<br>of pronouncing those Dutch names but<br>born in the Netherlands Mark was always<br>interested in animals his teenage<br>ambition was to be a vet until somebody<br>pointed out to him that half the job or<br>even more was dealing with cattle and<br>pigs and being armed deep in places you<br>don't want to<br>contemplate so he turned his interest to<br>fish which led to aquaculture studies at<br>venan University in the<br>Netherlands in 1990 and at two years<br>after graduating Mark made his way way<br>to New Zealand as a new immigrant one of<br>the last of the postwar diaspora that<br>bought so many from the Netherlands to<br>New Zealand this was a one-way ticket<br>paid for by the Dutch government along<br>with an offer of suspension of sub<br>conscription into the army so I'm left<br>concluding that the Dutch don't<br>development newly arrived to New Zealand<br>Mark found employment as a farmand at<br>New Zealand King Sam<br>which after a few what am I doing here<br>moments led to enrollment as a PhD<br>student in our department of zoology<br>here at<br>otago after completing his PhD Mark<br>spent two years as a post-doctoral<br>fellow at the University of Hokkaido in<br>Japan before returning to our zoology<br>Department as a foundation of research<br>science and technology postdoctoral<br>fellow for two years and then a further<br>year as a technology and Industry fellow<br>to consider eel farming potential<br>Professor lochan's first academic<br>appointment was in our department of<br>Marine Science in 2002 before he<br>migrated back to the zoology Department<br>halfway through th uh 2003 where he has<br>been ever since and now just two decades<br>on we celebrate his rise through the<br>ranks from lecturer to full<br>professor as Professor Brock has<br>indicated promotion to professor at the<br>University of otago is far from Easy and<br>one must excel in each of the three<br>academic domains of research teaching<br>and<br>service I'll begin with research<br>Professor lochman is an internationally<br>renowned or recognized researcher in the<br>area of animal phys physiology<br>particularly fish and he has made<br>outstanding contributions in both<br>fundamental and applied research he is<br>productive and his list of significant<br>career Publications currently stands at<br>115 almost all his first or second<br>author and he has an H index of 31 many<br>of his papers have been published with<br>postgraduate students and post-doctoral<br>fellows that have been mentored in his<br>laboratory he is a member of the<br>editorial advisory boards for<br>aquaculture and for the journal fishes<br>and development and reproduction all of<br>which are leading international journals<br>in their respective<br>Fields his International recognition and<br>also includes as a member of the<br>international advisory committee for the<br>the 10th International Symposium on<br>reproductive physiology of fish held in<br>Portugal in<br>2014 he's been twice a recipient of<br>seven-month invitation fellowships from<br>the Japan Society for the promotion of<br>Science and he was a recipient of the<br>sharing prize from the New Zealand<br>endocrine<br>Society Professor lochman is also an<br>outstanding teacher and has been<br>recognized as such from early in his<br>career having been nominated for an<br>otago teaching award back in in 2009 he<br>has consistently led new teaching<br>initiatives in his area of expertise<br>focusing on self-led learning and skills<br>development and has played a key role in<br>developing new curricular particularly<br>in the area of animal<br>physiology one of Mark's passions when<br>it comes to teaching has been not in in<br>AO New Zealand but in Myanmar where he<br>led internationally funded initiatives<br>to develop teaching in Yang gon and<br>unfortunately the continued development<br>of this program has been suspended by<br>the political instability in<br>Myanmar this brings me to the final<br>domain in which our professor much must<br>Excel which is service to the university<br>in the broader discipline externally and<br>in addition to the editorial<br>responsibilities that I've just<br>mentioned he is a council member of the<br>New Zealand Society of endocrinology and<br>is one of our leading fish physiologists<br>is sought after for his expertise to<br>evaluate grants both domestically for<br>organizations such as the ministry of<br>business in Innovation and employment as<br>well as tarangi the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand but also internationally for the<br>Netherlands and cuw governments and for<br>the European<br>commission at the University level he<br>has served as the associate Dean<br>International for the division of<br>Sciences a position he held from 2014 to<br>2018 he is a vocal member of the<br>and he has served on the genetics and<br>ecology Board of studies he's been a<br>convenor Steering group to establish the<br>Strategic framework for students for<br>whom English is an additional language<br>he has served on the leaders of the<br>future scholarships committee and he's<br>also spent time on the animal Ethics<br>Committee one of our more demanding<br>committees at the University but the<br>last role that I want to mention is Mark<br>service's head of Department of zoology<br>Mark is one of a long line of Highly<br>affected and respected leaders of this<br>important department and I can say that<br>in this role he is a tiess champion for<br>the department and he always has a<br>respectful eye out for ways in which the<br>university can better serve its academic<br>engine room and can I offer my personal<br>thanks for this<br>work I think that's enough for me and so<br>now it is time to hear from Professor<br>lochman himself please join me in<br>M just checking that the microphone's<br>working yep great um thank you Professor<br>Brock thank you Professor<br>Spencer<br>for<br>for and last but not least of course um<br>over to uh to English<br>um thank you all for coming<br>whether you are here or in the live<br>stream um it is a it is a fantastic<br>opportunity and a real honor for me to<br>be able to present present um and and<br>actually it is incredibly humbling um to<br>to be here and to be given the stage um<br>in the next well the microphone went for<br>eight hours right so so I hope you<br>brought dinner um we might be here for a<br>while um thank you to<br>um the academic party thank you to my<br>colleagues um in Zoology the students<br>from zoology um people from um my church<br>family of course my blood family here um<br>just um absolutely fantastic you are<br>here<br>um and of course those of you here are<br>who are here as just members of the<br>general public thank you all for coming<br>um I um take real pride and pleasure in<br>taking you through my academic journey<br>and of course going through that Journey<br>um I will also be reflecting on some of<br>my personal walk so let's see if all the<br>equipment is going to work um I should<br>have probably P pressed the button a<br>little bit earlier but if you hadn't<br>gotten it um there is a um Mari flag<br>there's a Netherlands flag there's a<br>flag so let me we start in 1966 which is<br>the year that I was born would didn't<br>have color photos in those days so black<br>and white it is um and yes it is that oh<br>yes it is that little kind of Red Dot<br>the size of otago and um Southland which<br>is um the country in which I was born in<br>keeping with really um Mari Papa<br>and um the way that Mari relate back to<br>the the place where they're from I think<br>the Asel river is probably the closest<br>thing to my River um I was born in a<br>place called deepen fan which is<br>probably you would have been able to<br>pronounce that Richard it would have<br>been no problem um it's a it's a a place<br>about 5,000 or so maybe 10,000 people<br>these days and it and it um is situated<br>along the river<br>Asel I don't have particularly close<br>links to the asil myself but both my<br>parents do um my mother was born in the<br>same house as I was born believe it or<br>not and my father um grew up a little<br>bit south from there and he died last<br>year and his ases we returned early this<br>year to the river asil so I think I<br>could call that my River just to<br>introduce my family this is my mom um my<br>brother Yos my two sisters um Ena and<br>Susanna and all of them with their<br>families live in the Netherlands um this<br>is obviously my dad who is watching from<br>high up and this is my brother case who<br>family as a child I have always been<br>interested in fish the colors the shapes<br>the movement<br>um I think that's my understanding that<br>it started when I was two turs High my<br>parents gave me a bucket in a net we<br>were on holiday in France somewhere and<br>that was one of those kids sorted and<br>they had one less one less to worry<br>about um and that continued my dad had a<br>fish tank for a while I don't know how<br>many hours I sat in front of that and in<br>my teenage years I spent quite a bit of<br>time um along the water side trying to<br>catch whatever I could it never was very<br>much but that's a different story for<br>another<br>day when I was 18 um having finished<br>high school of course the question is<br>what do you do next and I think those<br>who knew me would not have been<br>surprised that I opted to go to Ving<br>University here in the center of the<br>country to undertake a study in animal<br>production with a specific focus on fish<br>aquaculture which was a new industry<br>really that started in the N late 1970s<br>early 80s so it's a it's a it's an<br>industry that um from a maybe academic<br>angle at least I've seen develop over<br>the last 40 or so<br>years um and this is one of the<br>facilities belonging to vening<br>University<br>and then I came to New Zealand in 1990<br>it took a while before I um met the love<br>of my life but it happened in 2003 we<br>married in 2004 and we've been really<br>blessed um with these three wonderful<br>people<br>Yohan Lisa and Emily and of course this<br>is kanako over here and this is a<br>picture that we um took while on holiday<br>in the cor mandal earlier this year<br>point to note though is this cartoon<br>here at the top um you see some old guy<br>kind of with a shovel my mom's surname<br>has the word clay in it um we kind of<br>take that to mean that my ancestry is<br>somewhere digging clay or Pete somewhere<br>in the kind of far east of the<br>Netherlands my wife on the other hand<br>has a samurai background word has it so<br>well fun blue blood in the<br>samurai why eels might you say and<br>that's of course getting me to the topic<br>of my talk um I want to um say a little<br>bit about my my background and why I'm<br>so interested in these fish and I'll<br>provide a little bit of eels 101 which<br>is a paper that we don't yet offer at<br>the University of otago but I'm sure<br>that after today's presentation it'll be<br>high up on the<br>agenda um it would have been 1974 when I<br>was given a book for Christmas um this<br>book here wondering on the the water<br>spel which sort of translates um as<br>Mysteries beneath the water surface um<br>and initially as an 8-year-old um and<br>there might be some 8year olds here<br>maybe not older than 8y old so that's<br>fine um I would have looked at the<br>images um I would have looked at the<br>colors the shapes and everything else<br>but by the time I got to be 10 or 11 I<br>got to read the story and the book has<br>sentimental value I still have it I<br>should have brought it as a prop maybe<br>but I left it at home um but somewhere<br>in that book is a story about the<br>freshwater eel and that story in many<br>ways has shaped um certainly my academic<br>life which gets us to eels<br>101 just to give you a little bit of<br>background about these fish because it's<br>relevant for the remainder of the<br>story um the story in some ways starts<br>here in the Mediterranean in the mid<br>1800 S I wasn't around in those days I'm<br>old but not quite that old um it starts<br>in the middle of the<br>Mediterranean um Mid mid 1800s when um a<br>group of people caught some leaf leaf<br>shaped fishes and they put them in a<br>specific kind of classified them in<br>their own<br>species by the late 1800s somebody had<br>the smart idea to take some of these<br>little critters and put them in a fish<br>tank and to their surprise saw these<br>animals transform from a leaf<br>leaf-shaped larva to a little eel shaped<br>larvae so by the late 1800s the connect<br>between that new species by the mid<br>1800s and the eel was made in the early<br>1900s a Danish biologist Johan Schmidt<br>um undertook a number of cruises and<br>initially because they had they found<br>the larva in the Mediterranean initially<br>his the idea was well maybe that's where<br>the larv are and maybe that's where the<br>spawning ground of the European eel<br>could be found but he found that the<br>further he traveled away from Denmark<br>towards the um Western Atlantic he found<br>baby eels that were progressively<br>smaller and smaller and so he concluded<br>at the end um in this paper from around<br>1923 that the eels spawned in the saraso<br>se you might have heard some of you have<br>probably heard that story<br>back to this book um the book pictured<br>that story um explained that story and<br>um it highlighted the the many the many<br>things that we didn't know about the<br>animals um to a 10-year-old an<br>11-year-old that was imagination run<br>wild um it was certainly a dream to be<br>on a boat and to be the explorer that<br>found found these eels at their spawning<br>ground so that's just a little bit of<br>just looking at the time and it says 55<br>minutes I think I started it a bit<br>earlier um I came to New Zealand in 1990<br>um as was mentioned um<br>and um in my early days working for New<br>Zealand King sammon I had been told that<br>nearby there was an eel fishing and<br>processing place so my ears kind of went<br>like this e fishing that's me I got to<br>be there and so so I paid them a visit<br>and I ended up um meeting nolene and<br>Trevor gold um who have since<br>essentially adopted me as their um Dutch<br>son um having four girls of roughly my<br>age themselves um Trevor to passed away<br>a number of years ago so he too will be<br>um undoubtedly up there um be watching<br>this talk um but we keep good contact<br>with<br>noene they looked after me in many ways<br>um I told my story my interest in eel<br>and Trevor said well if that's what you<br>do and that's your interest I'll have to<br>find you a job and offer you a job won't<br>I which he did um so we looked at the<br>feasibilities of eel farming in the<br>Summers of um 91 and<br>'92 at that point um I had organized for<br>my studies at the University of otago to<br>start and it was going to be on<br>reproduction of eel um and I'll um I I<br>guess I get constantly reminded when I'm<br>at the golds meeting the golds family<br>I've kind of given myself the the prompt<br>to turn that g into a red color because<br>my nickname very soon became Dr gonet<br>um and 40 years on 30 years on that<br>hasn't<br>changed um I arrived at oo um in the end<br>of January um 1992 and was very<br>fortunate<br>to um be taken under his wing by<br>Professor grahe young who's now at the<br>University of Washington um grahe was a<br>very much a a salmon person um he his<br>his history and I'll saf you're talking<br>about his history but his history was um<br>in a place where they' done some eel<br>work I think it would be fair to say and<br>Graeme is probably online so Graeme if<br>I've got this wrong you can you can hit<br>me later um but but Graeme um probably<br>wasn't overly interested in eels yes as<br>a as a as a biological sort of problem<br>but not as an animal but anyway he he<br>took me under his wing and I think it<br>would be fair to say that without Trevor<br>noene and grahe young I'm not sure that<br>I would have stood here today so um<br>between the three of that um between the<br>three of them um yes you've been<br>Lifesavers and this is a perfect time I<br>think to say thank you for all your<br>go back to eels 101 um I want to keep<br>this um reasonably short now that we are<br>okay with the idea that eels undertake a<br>longdistance spawning migration in the<br>case of New Zealand eels that spawning<br>migration leads these fish somewhere in<br>the kind of vicinity of Tonga Fiji um<br>vanua to maybe new calonia somewhere in<br>that generic space the animals spawn<br>there um all going to plan the eggs will<br>hatch and they develop in this Leaf<br>shaped larv that I talked to you about<br>before these Leaf shaped ly are carried<br>on the Southeast equatorial current that<br>roughly runs from there in between<br>Australia and New Zealand and delivers<br>these baby eels to New Zealand and upon<br>arriving at the continental shelf these<br>fish undergo a transformation become<br>these glass eels that you can then also<br>clearly um in the 18 late 1800s has been<br>observed in the fish tank and these<br>um white bed like Critter move upstream<br>and as they do they acquire<br>pigmentation for five 10 20 50 pick a<br>number between n and infinity so it<br>would seem these eels will um grow and<br>at some point having reached adult size<br>um they will then under undergo a<br>transformation and they become a migrant<br>ill<br>um good point to make here that eels are<br>also of cultural value to Mari so tuna<br>is the Mari name for eel and the<br>different forms of eel come with<br>different um um suffixes and prefixes<br>these eels leave New Zealand and<br>obviously swim back over there to<br>complete their business and then they<br>presumably die after<br>spawning come back to the 10 or 11 year<br>old who me um who read the book um and<br>this quote from Johan Schmidt um is<br>often used by eel researchers altogether<br>the whole story of the eel and its<br>spawning has come to read almost like a<br>romance where in reality has far<br>exceeded the dreams of fantasy and I<br>think even now we can um still maintain<br>that particular statement nothing much<br>has changed despite all the new<br>information that we've gained in the<br>last<br>century the remainder of the research<br>part of my talk is simply or simply<br>mainly focusing on comparing the<br>freshwater stage of the eel to the<br>animal that is ready to migrate we call<br>this freshwater face often the yellow<br>eel so I'm using a yellow cartoon this<br>is going to come back throughout the<br>presentation and the eel once it has<br>transformed tends to take on a bit of a<br>silvery Livery and um these eels look<br>dramatically different as I'll show you<br>in the next image and in the remainder<br>of my presentation these will be<br>eels um point to note here is that my<br>enthusiasm for um for eels was clearly<br>um carried over across to my family um<br>my oldest was 5year old when in kindy he<br>was given the opportunity to draw<br>something that his old man might might<br>like<br>presumably and to my absolute<br>astonishment he didn't just draw an eel<br>he drew one of these lepto spilus larve<br>which most of us have never even heard<br>of absolutely<br>fantastic now these yellow and silver<br>stages as mentioned actually look quite<br>different and it would take me 5 Seconds<br>To Train all of you to have a 100%<br>success rate in separating a feeding<br>yellow eel from a migrant silver eel so<br>we can see the yellow eel here at the<br>top um depends on the species a little<br>bit but they tend to have a little bit<br>of a yellow brownish Sheen the silver<br>eel um almost exclusively comes with<br>these pitch black Bal fins increases in<br>eye size and typically a sharpening of<br>the head shape which conceivably could<br>help with their longdistance migration<br>right so notable notably different life<br>history stages of phenotypes that are<br>readily<br>distinguishable done with eels 101 I can<br>now come um to I I guess try and explain<br>and hopefully I've done that to some<br>extent um what I'm going to be talking<br>about um so I don't know if you saw this<br>eel but there's an eel in my pocket over<br>here so I'll pop that in there right got<br>to look after these guys and um no it<br>doesn't want to um and as you will hear<br>in the in my talk as we go Japan has<br>been an absolutely important um part of<br>my life this will come back in my talk<br>so this says unagi or e in Japanese and<br>it seemed appropriate that I should put<br>that on my on my poster but obviously we<br>are going to talking be talking about<br>the preparation what is it that happens<br>from a yellow heel as it transforms into<br>eel my study in<br>1992 um was principally based at Lake<br>elisir or at least that's where the<br>animals were caught<br>T and we used um help from fishermen or<br>at times um I would have gone out<br>myself we collected a whole bunch of<br>tissues and um one of the things I was<br>really interested in in my early days<br>was to really kind of get a feel for the<br>reproductive status how did these yellow<br>wheels compare to these silver<br>eels when we look at the row the future<br>eggs kind the technical term is uos<br>sites but I'm just going to use them<br>call them eggs if we look at the future<br>eggs in the yellow wheels we see these<br>little blobs that are less than 0.1 mm<br>in<br>diameter if you look at Silver those<br>animals ready to migrate we see much<br>larger blobs that are about a quarter in<br>quarter of a millimeter in diameter and<br>they contain all that white stuff and<br>that's all lipid that's being washed out<br>during processing so the eggs increase<br>about threefold in diameter<br>at the by the time the animal is ready<br>to<br>migrate I was also interested in looking<br>at hormones in the bloodstream so we<br>measured estrogens which we tend to<br>associate with female reproductive<br>function I should highlight that um<br>everything I present is on females and<br>um it comes as no surprise I think that<br>in migrants that are ready to migrate<br>and in which the eggs are larger than in<br>these yellow feeding non-migrating eels<br>we see higher level of<br>estrogen um so that was very much<br>confirming what we already knew um the<br>excitement really and may be no<br>excitement to you but it was a lot of<br>excitement for me um pertains to this<br>thing here 11 keto testosterone which um<br>that thing has it's a steroid hormone<br>that in many ways has defined my<br>academic life um I don't quite sleep<br>with it but short from um it has been<br>Central to um<br>many of my my academic Endeavors my<br>research Endeavors I've got a<br>logarithmic scale here if you don't know<br>what that means it doesn't matter the<br>key thing is that in these migratory<br>silver there's a heck a lot more heck of<br>a lot more of that stuff than we can see<br>in these yellow<br>wheels what do that got to do with the<br>price of fish ha um well 11 key to<br>testosterone is C<br>as a male specific fish steroid hormone<br>and the samples that I collected were<br>from females so that's that's pretty<br>exciting right at least you kind of got<br>something that you don't expect um and<br>um of course there's a whole bunch of<br>questions well where does it come from<br>what does it do and so on well the first<br>thing to do for me was to make sure that<br>what we had measured using immunological<br>techniques using an antibody um could<br>actually be<br>confirmed using um analytical chemistry<br>and I had the opportunity my parents um<br>after 3 years away from the Netherlands<br>decided they wanted to see me hard to<br>imagine but but they did um so I went<br>back to the Netherlands and had the<br>opportunity to spend a few weeks at the<br>University of utre and I brought a whole<br>bunch of samples with me on dry ice and<br>um processed these samples using a<br>technique technique known as gas<br>chromatography and mass<br>spectrometry long story short if we take<br>the steroid 11 K to testosterone by<br>itself and we put it on that machine<br>then we get a couple of peaks in that<br>particular<br>position if we take a blood sample of<br>these fish that have 11 keto<br>testosterone in their bloodstream we get<br>these same Peaks and they're not so<br>noticeable um for these smaller<br>fragments but this major fragment is<br>clearly f um visible and um that<br>basically confirmed that that 11 K of<br>testosterone that was so unexpected I<br>could actually analytically detect with<br>chemical<br>methods this thing looks like that um<br>never mind what it looks like too much<br>but the question is um was this<br>something that was found in other fish<br>as well and we just didn't look so who<br>produces it<br>um where is it made and 30 years on I<br>regret to say that I cannot answer that<br>question in response to which factors is<br>it made and 30 is on I regret to say<br>that I can't really answer that question<br>and and what does it do and I reckon I<br>can answer that question so that's what<br>we're going to have a look<br>at the first thing I did was to try<br>answer the question did we Overlook it<br>is I mean it was a little bit of a<br>chance finding the steroid this<br>particular steroid in female<br>eel maybe is actually something that old<br>fish female fish make and we simply<br>didn't look for it so um I had the<br>opportunity um managed to get some money<br>through Fellowship I had the opportunity<br>to go fishing and Mark shellenberg there<br>he is you were on that trip um and I<br>think you'd agree that that was a good<br>trip that was amazing we spend a week in<br>doubtful sound um kind of chased by<br>Dolphins trying to catch a bunch of fish<br>of different species and I also imported<br>some blood samples from across the world<br>so in the end I had a bag of samples<br>representing 30 different<br>species and um this is perhaps a<br>somewhat busy slide um and it doesn't<br>represent 30 species I kind of top<br>sliced the top the top part of them but<br>the main kind of take-home message is if<br>we he look at the bottom are two bars<br>for each of these different fish species<br>a testosterone bar and in black is the<br>11 keto testosterone bar and the<br>testosterone bar is representative of<br>what we find in female fishes in general<br>so finding testosterone in a female fish<br>is nothing<br>unusual finding 11 keto testosterone in<br>a female fish is not so common and<br>really only in Sturgeon and in eel can<br>levels of 11 keto testosterone equate or<br>fire exceed those found for testosterone<br>so 11 keto testosterone is in terms of<br>quantities in the bloodstream important<br>in eels and in sturon now sturon are not<br>even closely related to eels so I will<br>leave the sturgeon on the side but focus<br>on what it might be that 11 keto<br>eels one of the approaches that we can<br>use is to use live eels to provide these<br>eels with 11 keto testosterone and then<br>see how they respond to the<br>drug um to do so we made some<br>do-it-yourself um tablets slow to<br>release implants we put these implants<br>in the body cavity of the fish and<br>basically watched and see what happened<br>for a couple of weeks comparing fish<br>that received implants that did contain<br>11 K to testosterone with a control<br>group that got the tablet but without<br>one of the first things we did was to<br>ensure that the tablet was capable to<br>release 11 K to testosterone and<br>maintain levels of that hormone in the<br>bloodstream at a reasonably constant<br>level for a prolonged period of time and<br>we can see that that is indeed the case<br>over um about one month 720 odd hours<br>levels of 11 KET to testosterone<br>essentially remained unchanged here in<br>blue compared to the control group here<br>in the um white bars so pretty happy<br>with the quality of the DIY job and<br>appreciating that that is probably going<br>questions comparing the control group in<br>a group that had been treated with 11<br>keto testosterone for two weeks resulted<br>in some dramatic differences in the<br>appearance of the fish so got the<br>control group at the top here we have<br>the fish treated with 11 keto<br>testosterone<br>that just looked like that 2 weeks<br>earlier in the bottom IM image note the<br>pitch black back pectral fin the more<br>sharpening of the head shape and not so<br>evident from this image but there is<br>also an increase in eye size and I take<br>you back to eels<br>101 where um the comment was made that<br>by the time eels reached the Silver<br>Stage they have pitch black backr fence<br>a sharpened head and an increased eye<br>size and obviously the question that we<br>could ask is is 11 keto testosterone the<br>hormone that transforms a yellow eel<br>eel certainly on the basis of the<br>external Anatomy that seem to be the<br>case if we look at the internal anatomy<br>then actually we get a similar sort of<br>generic picture so we have the yellow<br>wheel here in the center this thing here<br>is the liver it is increased in a<br>natural silver<br>it is increased in a yellow wheel<br>treated with 11 keto testosterone here<br>in cream we have the future row<br>containing the eggs it is increased in<br>size in the silver eel is barely visible<br>in the yellow eel and is greatly<br>increased in size in fish treated with<br>11 keto<br>testosterone um and maybe not so evident<br>from this image but here we have the<br>digestive tract the intestine it tends<br>to reduce in the silver eel and again<br>that was a um observation that was<br>mimicked by 11 keto testosterone so<br>we're on the right track would certainly<br>seem that not only externally but also<br>internally some of the effects of 11<br>keto testosterone seem to resemble those<br>of the fish that would naturally undergo<br>this<br>transformation I had Georgia Thompson<br>Lang Georgia you might be on the live<br>stream um saying hi um Georgia compared<br>yellow eels and silver eels and focused<br>on the pigments in the eye eels in<br>freshwater are particularly well adapted<br>to um picking up light at 520 nanometers<br>that's in the green Spectrum we can see<br>that here and eels in the silver the<br>Silver Stage um Express a different type<br>of pigment in their eyes that is<br>particularly suitable at picking up blue<br>light we measured that and that was<br>indeed the case that had already been<br>published but where it gets the story<br>gets really interesting is that Georgia<br>retrieved eyes from yellow wheels and<br>she placed them in a fluid that's a<br>little bit like drip fluid when you go<br>to the hospital they put that line in<br>your arm it's a it's a fluid that kind<br>of keeps tissues in good shape we call<br>it ringer in biology but it's kind of<br>drip fluid in many ways she took the<br>eyes and Cho chopped up the retina into<br>small pieces and Supply different<br>quantities of 11 keto testosterone and<br>lo and behold in the presence of 11 keto<br>testosterone there was a trend for a<br>reduction in the green opsin that we<br>would see in freshwater um yellow wheels<br>and there was an increase in the<br>expression of the opsin associated with<br>the migratory phenotype so even in a<br>tissue culture dish it would seem that<br>11 KET to testosterone can mimic what we<br>can see<br>in Wild eels as it transform from the<br>yellow to the Silver Silver<br>Stage Dr Elvin saan um was a postdoc<br>working with me for a while particularly<br>interested in the interface or the<br>interaction between hormones and<br>behavior and using the same Paradigm<br>again in the presence of 11 KY to<br>testosterone there is increased activity<br>there is increased movement again<br>representing what we would normally<br>encounter during the natural<br>transformation between the two life<br>history<br>stages and Dr Aon damste looked at a<br>variety of endpoints this is a slightly<br>diff busy slide but really she looked at<br>the intestine the ovary and the liver<br>comparing yellow and silver eels there<br>are changes between those life history<br>stages and at least some of these<br>changes can be mimicked by treatment<br>with 11 Keto testost<br>tone so it would certainly seem that 11<br>keto testosterone has the ability to at<br>least in part mimic the changes or<br>induce the changes that we would<br>normally see as an eel prepares for its<br>migration that's kind of one part of the<br>bit of data I wanted to show you I want<br>to come back to this slide that I showed<br>you earlier which compared um eggs of<br>these yellow eels small eggs less than<br>0.1 of a millimeter where silver eels<br>that have eggs of about a quar of a<br>millimeter um and reiterating that I set<br>out as a student in 1992 to try and<br>understand aspects of the reproductive<br>biology um I come back to the effect of<br>11 keto testosterone on the developing<br>eggs themselves and I recall that um in<br>in response to treatment with 11 keto<br>testost on the ovary that cream colored<br>tissue that I showed you before<br>increased in size presumably and that<br>was the hypothesis presumably reflecting<br>an increase in the diameter of the eggs<br>in that<br>ovary and that's where my Japan story<br>sort of starts um in<br>1974 professors Yami and Yamamoto<br>published a paper in nature in which<br>they reported on having succeeded making<br>baby Fs in captivity and when I started<br>my PhD in 1992 that was certainly<br>something to Aspire to and I was<br>fortunate that my supervisor Professor<br>Graeme young had worked with colleagues<br>in Japan and had basically set me up for<br>a visit there in<br>1994<br>um in hakodate here at the southern end<br>of the um Hokkaido Island this is the<br>Japan's main island Tokyo over here and<br>Nagasaki at the Far Western end um so I<br>had numerous trips to that um lab I<br>spend two years there as a postdoc um<br>and professor yamochi and Professor<br>adachi were my hosts and I learned many<br>techniques molecular techniques tissue<br>culture techniques um I Lear learned um<br>a bit of Japanese just a little bit and<br>I learned to have a good time when going<br>out with friends in a nomia it's a very<br>good<br>place um I also got the opportunity<br>while I was there to<br>um um to realize my childhood dream to<br>be that Explorer on the boat um to find<br>the spawning ground of the eel and I was<br>invited by professor katsumi tuamoto in<br>1998 to join the hakaru um their<br>research vessel um for a cruise to the<br>Mariana Trench of Guam on that boat was<br>also this um submarine that could see<br>two people and it was as I said a<br>childhood dream come through um it was<br>good while it lasted I'm happy to have<br>soil so can 11 keto testosterone affect<br>the size of the eel egg during<br>development and to get to that question<br>we harvested the row or the immature<br>ovary chopped it into small pieces and<br>put it in that drip fluid with or<br>without different quantities of 11 keto<br>testosterone and these were the sort of<br>outcomes that we had on the left we have<br>a control group on the right we have a<br>group treated with El keto testosterone<br>and these are pieces of tissue from the<br>exact same fish that's the beauty of<br>some of these experiments when you use a<br>tissue culture dish you can use material<br>from the same animal and distribute it<br>between different<br>treatments and these blobs the future<br>eggs here um what I I hope that to you<br>they might seem a little bit bigger in<br>the 11 keto testosterone group than in<br>the control group if you're not<br>convinced um of course they got measured<br>diligently and there is a clear um<br>effect of 11 K to testosterone and with<br>an increasing dose the relative increase<br>or the relative size of these immature<br>egg um increases and that effect was not<br>estrogen one of the observations when<br>treating animals with um testosterone 11<br>K testosterone implants in the live<br>animal was also that there was<br>indication of increased amounts of lipid<br>so we decided we'd add some lipid to<br>these<br>incubations um and this is the kind of<br>basic lipid molec a triy glyceride and<br>we bought some radio Radioactive stuff<br>um the beauty of using<br>radioactive fat is that when you add it<br>to a culture and you then was the<br>culture you can actually see whether<br>that radioactivity has been taken up<br>into the tissue right so um after one<br>day in the presence of 11 keto<br>testosterone again in blue we see an<br>increase in the amount of<br>radioactivity and that again is<br>reiterated by day four so clearly in the<br>presence of fats um there was evidence<br>for increased incorporation of lipids in<br>these developing<br>eggs my Japanese colleagues continued<br>that work um and then in some ways kind<br>of we piggybacked on it using what is<br>known as very low density lipo protein<br>something that we all have we don't just<br>have lipids in our bloodstream because<br>lipids float on water right and we've<br>got all the lipids in our heads and<br>we've got nothing down there so these<br>lipids need to be packaged and that<br>packaged in a ball that we call A<br>lipoprotein the shell on the out side<br>being the protein and the stuff on the<br>inside being the fat so if you purify<br>those lip lipoproteins and you add them<br>to the culture then in the presence of<br>11 keto testosterone over here we can<br>see that in the presence of vldl that<br>lipoprotein and 11 keto testosterone we<br>get an increase here in the size of the<br>developing egg<br>also we get an increase in the amount of<br>these white lipid inclusions in the egg<br>right so I think one of the key strands<br>of my work on eel is that um it would<br>seem that 11 keto testosterone is indeed<br>capable of transforming a yellow eel<br>into a silver eel at least in part and<br>while it is doing so it also can affect<br>the development of the egg and we get an<br>increase egg size and an increase in the<br>amount of lipid that is accumulated into<br>that egg what drives the production of<br>11 keto testosterone at this point<br>remains a question<br>mark regardless up comes our quote I<br>think that the whole story of the eel<br>and its spawning continues to be read<br>almost like a romance where in reality<br>we've not only done ear work in my lab<br>group we've worked on other species um<br>salmon um zebra fish not only on egg<br>formation but also stress and metabolism<br>and we increasingly interested in the<br>environment but as I was already um<br>alerted to or mentioned um at the<br>introduction<br>um not only is an academic role<br>associated with research uh with<br>research an important part is teaching<br>and<br>service and um I think for me this is a<br>good time to briefly reflect on<br>that I go back to my appointment between<br>2014 and 2018 as associate Dean<br>International for Sciences when in 2016<br>I got a message from the den director Mr<br>Simon Chu saying ah be Keen to have a<br>chat to you please come to my office so<br>dutifully I<br>did and Simon asked well I've got this<br>thing going on in Myanmar um and I saw<br>tin walk in before um Dr tinlin Who is a<br>research fellow in um microbiology and<br>Immunology um he is himself burmes is a<br>graduate from the University of otago<br>and he felt it would be a wonderful<br>thing to give back to his own people but<br>also to the university by setting up a<br>promotional drive in<br>mymar and here we have a map of myar<br>Yangon the biggest city kind of crudely<br>in the middle of that of that country um<br>and Simon asked well would you like to<br>go there and contribute um to a<br>promotional presentation for the<br>University of otago and after talking to<br>the boss um I got the green lights so<br>off I went and it was just for a couple<br>of days and that was the interesting bin<br>it was for a 4 five day trip during<br>presentation and I can almost remember<br>Simon saying well you're going to be<br>there for 45 minutes while be while on a<br>5-day trip it would be nice if you did<br>something useful with the remainder of<br>your time over and Beyond being um being<br>a tourist so<br>I mean other than 10 there's probably no<br>one in the audience who's got any<br>experience having been in myama but I<br>can tell you in 2016 there was very<br>little that I could find about<br>aquaculture in myamar and I tried and I<br>tried and I tried and in the end I found<br>a trade magazine that mentioned um a<br>professor's name Professor Caleb in tun<br>and Kate um I understand that you may be<br>um on Zoom as well with your students so<br>if you are there um<br>MinGa um I found out that Professor K<br>had um given this interview for this<br>trade magazine aquaculture trade<br>magazine but no way for me to get a hold<br>of K so I I tried and tried and in the<br>end I found that she had um done a PhD<br>study at the University of Tokyo and I<br>found the professor's name so with the<br>best Japanese that I could must I asked<br>if I could get a professor K's email<br>address and I got it in no time and<br>suddenly I had a contact at the<br>University of Yangon so I visited there<br>um and she she wasn't there at the time<br>actually but her staff took me through<br>the labs and the labs were actually um<br>beautifully set up um key here is US a<br>that is widely advertised on the<br>material inside the labbs<br>um and usaid had been working alongside<br>k to um work towards um curriculum um<br>capacity capacity development growing<br>capacity and<br>improving um the um technical<br>capabilities of her<br>Labs Professor Kay and I stayed in touch<br>um after my visit and I have since been<br>another four times during which time I<br>have either been employed by usaid<br>or by the German corporation for<br>international collaboration and I can<br>only but say that none of this would<br>have been possible without the blessings<br>of Professor Helen Nicholson and I'm<br>sure that she's pulled a few strings for<br>me behind the scene so um grateful to<br>Helen who sends her apologies today but<br>um grateful to Helen for all the work<br>that she's done in supporting me making<br>those trips to myma<br>possible I'm nearing the end of my<br>presentation just a quick few words<br>about aquaculture in myanma um that's<br>relevant because that's what I quote did<br>while I was there it's a significant<br>industry um this figure is depicting the<br>largest producers worldwide and myamar<br>is the world's ninth largest producer of<br>aquaculture um fish and aquaculture and<br>most of that is in freshwater<br>systems undertook a domestic flight and<br>this is just an image from I don't know<br>high high taking a picture through the<br>um window of the plane and sure enough<br>there's plenty of earn ponds<br>there and when in a rural setting and<br>visiting these places there are<br>typically small ponds and in many cases<br>there were um simple housing was<br>associated with these ponds people<br>living upstairs and pigs or cattle<br>living downstairs and the droppings<br>would get washed out into the pond the<br>same here this is a chicken shed that is<br>built on top of a fish pond and of<br>course the drip the droppings are there<br>to fertilize the pond to stimulate ELO<br>production and um Zoo Plankton and fish<br>that as part of the appointment by GIS<br>and I had a um actually had a distant<br>appointment um in New Zealand um jolen<br>was helping me kindly with that um my<br>job there was very much around<br>curriculum development um and to help<br>realize the overall kind of aim of the<br>program a higher education curriculum to<br>be developed to support aquaculture<br>ideally at the Master's level but they<br>didn't have a bachelor's program either<br>so that's where we obviously started and<br>um probably all all up I've probably<br>spent the best part of three to four<br>four months of my life trying to<br>program to do so I was um supported by<br>Dr o Schultz who basically signed on the<br>dotted line Henrik schaltz who um was a<br>can do everything sort of um really<br>driven person in getting aquaculture<br>development in myma happening and of<br>course I worked with local academics um<br>and ran a couple of work jobs um ran a<br>couple of lab<br>classes so here are the academic staff I<br>worked with and I think what stands out<br>well did to me and probably stands out<br>to you is that they're all women and um<br>Academia in mymar is so poorly rewarded<br>in terms of finance that it pays for a<br>family to run a taxi rather than to be<br>to be employed in Academia so it is a<br>completely different level of doing<br>science and higher education than what<br>we are used to here in New<br>Zealand but the Japanese thread<br>continued while I was in myanma I had um<br>come to meet this chap over here this<br>gentleman over here Mr Sakamoto at the<br>back of the lab where we were working<br>and the office um he was tased with<br>looking at the feasibility of eel<br>aquaculture in myma and one day he<br>decided he'd make make some grilled<br>deal and I had tried in New Zealand many<br>many many times and it never was<br>particularly good it required me to go<br>to Japan to to myamar to be taught by a<br>Japanese chap in Myanmar how to how to<br>make kabayaki this says kabayaki party<br>how to make kabayaki a grill<br>deal I brought some but it is not<br>Ed but you probably don't want to try it<br>um and not only that one day I was<br>working in the office<br>there um and someone<br>goes<br>Mark and I look up and to my absolute<br>surprise it was Professor um Koshi Naga<br>Professor Koshi soyano from Nagasaki<br>University who might been uh a sabatical<br>leave guest with um a few years earlier<br>um the Mind spins and how that Japanese<br>thread continues in my life um is<br>absolutely amazing um of course I did<br>end up doing a bit of sightseeing um I<br>point out all the health the latest in<br>safety um and we also try to contribute<br>a little bit to um the dire economic<br>situation there um I was delighted that<br>the University was happy for me to send<br>a whole bunch of microscopes across to<br>Yangon in<br>2018 um and I managed to get full<br>sponsorship from Air New Zealand this is<br>no advertising but they paid for all the<br>shipment from Christ Church by plane to<br>um to Young gone which was<br>awesome we also have done a number of um<br>fundraisers um in thieves alley um with<br>my family with my church family<br>typically being great fun and um a good<br>way to generate a bit of<br>funds and while we're on Advertising um<br>of course um I don't have a a bag to get<br>you get you to put your money into but<br>of course at the end of the session<br>today you're all going online to World<br>Vision and sponsor a burmes child um and<br>living I have been privileged privileged<br>to work with Keen young people for over<br>30 years or 30 years over 20<br>years on these photos you can see the um<br>students whom I was the principal<br>supervisor of quite a few of whom are in<br>this room thank you for coming several<br>of whom are on um the live stream thank<br>you for dialing<br>in my journey would have been impossible<br>without the early help by Professor<br>grahe Young and the golds my connect to<br>Japan would not have happened if it<br>wasn't for um professors adachi nagahama<br>and um Yamauchi to host me my rsls<br>wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for<br>professor soyano ieri and palstra in the<br>Netherlands um I have been blessed by<br>two wonderful postdocs choosing to do<br>their postc work in my lab in the early<br>2010<br>oaki and um Elvin<br>setian Myanmar has changed my life I<br>could truly say that it has um hit a<br>note and um I think it is um a privilege<br>that we have to um get our young people<br>to get higher education believe you me<br>not everyone has that privilege so to<br>the young people in the audience<br>treasure that privilege it really is<br>that<br>privilege um yes um I have been head of<br>department for a while and I can but say<br>that that has been a really interesting<br>journey to those of my colleagues who<br>are in the audience think<br>not me I can only but say you missed an<br>opportunity because it is a really<br>amazing job yes it's got its up and<br>downs it's a really amazing job um I<br>want to acknowledge Nicki McHugh and um<br>Jacqueline Fraser for their day-to-day<br>support Professor Jerry CLA for passing<br>on the Baton and in many ways just<br>leaving me to it rather than um kind of<br>you know pushing your wisdom on me<br>perhaps um and the wisdom was there when<br>I needed it so thank you um a a big<br>really big welcome to Prof thank you to<br>Professor Ellison cre<br>um yes to have that soundboard that<br>me an equally big thank you to Professor<br>heish Spencer um heh you've probably<br>realized if I think I'm in the Poo<br>you're the first person I go<br>to um and I can but say thank you so<br>much for your wisdom for your ears for<br>everything that you've done you probably<br>um didn't sign up to become a mentor<br>but you just became it naturally so<br>thank you um to Professor Richard Barker<br>I'm sure I've been trying to tell you<br>what you should be doing for<br>zoology um and you will have and and I'm<br>sure you will have equally hard thought<br>mate you can say whatever you want but<br>we'll do it my way I I really I really<br>value um your willingness to provide a<br>safe space to talk to let me rent um to<br>take from it what you think is relevant<br>and to close the rest of that book and<br>move on um I I really couldn't have<br>you to all students and staff from<br>zoology we have a special place and I<br>think many of us realized that um so<br>past and current staff and students<br>you oh I should just read it out should<br>I what is the most important thing in<br>the world it is people it is people it<br>is<br>people<br>mfano thank you<br>Papa<br>pap<br>Papa<br>oh it's working tenot<br>Tena keep Professor Brock Professor B<br>ten Professor lman<br>Ina tenot Teno<br>tenoa greetings to you all professors<br>Brock and Barker to professor lochman<br>and your<br>family here and on live stream to<br>zoology colleagues both students and<br>staff and to all guests my name is heish<br>Spencer and is a professor in the<br>department of zoology I have the honor<br>and privilege to say a word of two of<br>thanks in response to Professor lochan's<br>inaugural professorial<br>lecture first of course wasn't that<br>wonderful an IPL is an opportunity to<br>show off why what you do is so exciting<br>so engrossing so entrancing it should<br>convey why you have dedicated a lifetime<br>to your research topic M IPL this<br>evening exemplify that goal so thank you<br>Mark<br>Nam as we have already heard Mark came<br>first to zoology as a PhD student back<br>in 1992 it was an exciting time in the<br>department with many new lecturing staff<br>including me that's how long he's been<br>around and a vibrant group of students<br>undergraduate and<br>postgraduate it was immediately apparent<br>that Mark was one of the very best of<br>the post graduate students he showed<br>genuine leadership in among the students<br>for example and what was a novelty at<br>the time publishing his research results<br>while still a PhD student he was also<br>very inventive in quite surprising ways<br>for example in devising methods to raise<br>money to support conference<br>participation and there's a good story<br>there but it's probably better for a<br>little bit later<br>on we have heard from Professor Barker<br>about Mark's illust ious research career<br>today but just let me add a few details<br>Mark has published over 110 referee<br>Journal articles and the range of topics<br>is really quite astounding reproduction<br>in harer giant Cockapoo rock cod<br>Kingfish catfish sturgeon salmon trout<br>perch seahorses sea stars and blue<br>muscles the physiology of power yellowy<br>penguins and freshwater crayfish sex<br>change in a fish and of course quite a<br>lot about eel but not just their<br>hormones and their reproduction but also<br>about things like their viruses and of<br>course about New Zealand and Japanese<br>species and<br>more this impressive range is Testament<br>to two of Mark's most notable and<br>admirable<br>characteristics aspects of his research<br>work that have led directly to his<br>scientific<br>success first he has this intense sense<br>of curiosity his desire to understand<br>just what is going on and second there<br>is his talent for connecting with other<br>scientists we saw a lot of that tonight<br>including many who are not<br>physiologists we hear a lot about the<br>need today for interdisciplinary and<br>transdisciplinary research well Mark has<br>been a practitioner for over 20<br>years I'd like to just focus briefly on<br>a separate aspect of Mark's career and<br>that is his academic leadership um which<br>is an important Criterion in the<br>promotion process we've heard that that<br>Mark has been the head of Department of<br>zoology for the past two years and being<br>head of department is demanding enough<br>at the best of times but Mark has been<br>head during rather difficult times as<br>the university has endured great<br>financial and other stresses so some<br>having someone of Marx ability as head<br>of department has served zoology<br>extremely well and I know my<br>departmental colleagues would join me in<br>acknowledging our debt to Mark here in<br>addition of course as Professor Baka has<br>already commented I know that math<br>qualities also strengthen the division<br>as a<br>whole so to sum up KARK for your<br>wonderful Kuro this evening and your<br>contributions to the university for many<br>years please uh accept this gift which<br>I'm pleased to see really is where it's<br>meant to<br>be as a token for this<br>so in closing I have one very important<br>request and that is that I invite you<br>all to the um join the academic party<br>for Refreshments in the staff Club thank<br>you again for joining in this evening's</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
