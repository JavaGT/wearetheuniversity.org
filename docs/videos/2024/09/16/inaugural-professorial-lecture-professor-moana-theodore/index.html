fore<br>for<br>for<br>fore<br>for<br>glor for<br>St<br>Reuben so I am judu Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor Marty here at the University<br>of otago and so on behalf of the senior<br>leadership team I welcome you all here<br>this evening for this very special event<br>to Mark and celebrate the promotion of<br>Professor Moana Theodore to our highest<br>academic<br>position so I acknowledge all our<br>colleagues and visitors here in person<br>and those online who are gathered<br>together to celebrate All Professor<br>Moana Theodor has achieved in her<br>remarkable career to this point and this<br>really is such a special occasion for<br>you Moana and for your Faro Hau and E<br>and many colleagues and collaborators<br>around the nation and I especially<br>acknowledge your dear Faro here this<br>evening including your husband Reuben<br>and your children and there are many<br>dignatories here in the room including<br>our local Member of Parliament Rachel<br>Brooking and Emeritus Professor um<br>Richard Bedford who's past president of<br>the the Royal Society<br>Tangi so this occasion this evening<br>represents years and years of<br>award-winning research and as a NAU<br>multi-disciplinary scholar Professor<br>Theodore has contributed enormously to<br>new knowledge in this country and<br>internationally and one of the roles of<br>a university is to help positively<br>transform society and your work on<br>investigating life course epidemiology<br>the development of chronic disease and<br>Marty health is exemplary your<br>indigenous Mari health research is at<br>the interface of Western and Indigenous<br>science methods and knowledge systems<br>it's critical work for this country as<br>an and as an Exemplar for anyone in the<br>world looking for what is possible when<br>we value indigenous knowledge alongside<br>Western systems of knowledge I also wish<br>to acknowledge your years of national<br>leadership and governance expertise and<br>I know many in this room have directly<br>benefited from your thoughtful and<br>careful decision making to make our<br>nation an even even better place to work<br>and live in and I know I personally have<br>too Professor Theodor you're breaking<br>new ground and revealing new insights<br>and knowledge about who we are as a<br>country and as your colleague and dear<br>friend it is my greatest Delight to<br>stand here with you this evening to Mark<br>the substantial occasion in your Stellar<br>career and I'm now going to hand hand<br>over to Professor Richard Barker our Pro<br>Vice Chancellor Sciences to more fully<br>introduce you so our warm welcome to you<br>noroot Professor Ruru T Professor<br>Theodore tqu professors Blakey and<br>Abraham t<br>friends and colleagues Teno Teno<br>ten it is my pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight Professor Rea Moana<br>Theodore from the Department of<br>psychology to give her in augural<br>professorial lecture here at the<br>University of<br>otago as indicated by Professor Ruru<br>Moana was promoted to Professor in<br>February this year and tonight we get to<br>celebrate this significant<br>achievement born at middlemore hospital<br>in Tamaki Makoto Professor Theodore<br>commenced her education at Mayfield<br>Primary School in East Tamaki before<br>progressing to Pap toytoy intermediate<br>and then Pap toytoy High School on<br>leaving High School Moana studied for a<br>Bachelor of Arts and psychology from the<br>Oakland before making her way to the<br>Deep South and studying for her<br>postgraduate diploma in Psychology here<br>at<br>otago this led to Career defining jobs<br>first as research assistant on the early<br>early learning project at the University<br>of otago and then as a research<br>assistant in the department of<br>psychology and then on to Junior<br>research fellow in the denen<br>multidisciplinary health and development<br>Research Unit better known as the denan<br>study where she worked as an<br>interviewer by now captured by her<br>interest in longitudinal studies Moana<br>headed off for her OE to London to do<br>what<br>to spend the final two years of the 20th<br>century as a research worker on the<br>e-risk study at King in King's College<br>in the London Institute of Psychiatry<br>the e-risk study follows a sample of<br>twins born in the UK between 1994 and<br>1995 with an initial focus on children's<br>disruptive behavior and the various risk<br>factors associated with this so I could<br>see why you wanted to take that one<br>on returning from London Moana undertook<br>her PhD<br>again at the University of Oakland which<br>she completed in 2006 before returning<br>to what is now her denan home where she<br>settled into a sequence of research<br>fellow roles with the denan study and<br>the national Center for life course<br>research this included a period as the<br>prestigious health research council at a<br>hapu merchie postdoctoral fellow which<br>she held in the National Center for life<br>course research from 2013 to 2015<br>Moana then resumed her position as a<br>research fellow in the National Center<br>for life course research becoming its<br>co-director in 2016 and then director in<br>2022 in the period from 2016 to 2022<br>Professor Theodore was the deputy<br>director of the Aging well National<br>Science challenge she was promoted to<br>senior re research fellow and then to<br>research associate professor while also<br>holding a health research Council<br>multihealth search emerging leader<br>fellowship and I've deliberately laid<br>all of this out because it tells a<br>remarkable tale of Rapid success in<br>spite of the precarity of these roles<br>and what I haven't yet mentioned is that<br>she also took three significant periods<br>of Parental<br>leave while studying too and to Mali<br>te despite all of that tonight we<br>celebrate this remarkable progress from<br>research fellow to full professor in a<br>little over a<br>decade Professor Theodore's research is<br>multi-disciplinary in nature and she has<br>expertise in life course epidemiology<br>the development of chronic disease and<br>moldy Health she is productive she has<br>55 papers and two chapters published and<br>nearly $5 million in research<br>grants this grant success includes as a<br>co-leader of naai maramatanga the n a<br>national Center of research<br>Excellence she's been able to secure an<br>MB smart ideas Grant along the way as<br>well as the two fellowships that I've<br>already<br>mentioned Moana has received recognition<br>for the Excellence of this work both<br>personally she received a national MDI<br>academic Excellence award in 2019 and<br>was a finalist for the international<br>Society for hypertension new<br>investigator award in<br>2012 but also as part of a award-winning<br>team that won the 2022 Rutherford medal<br>that was the denan study team following<br>on from their success in<br>2016 when they won the Prime Minister<br>Sciences<br>prize as is evident Moana is a natural<br>leader and she has now assumed the role<br>of the as director of the denan study<br>and in this role she has the<br>responsibility to continue the<br>remarkable work of her predecessors and<br>to nurture a research Tonga that is the<br>Fulfillment of the intersecting lifelong<br>visions of three Extraordinary People<br>Phil silver the late Richie Pon and now<br>Moana<br>Theodore her willingness to take on<br>these significant leadership rle speaks<br>to moana's exceptional service ethic<br>which is also reflected in the various<br>roles in governance and strategic<br>leadership in maldi and Indigenous<br>health and well-being research and mangi<br>and Science in 2019 Moana was appointed<br>by the minister of Health to the<br>Southern District Health Board between<br>2019 and 2022 she chaired the board's<br>disability support advisory committee<br>launching the first disability strategy<br>for the southern region and was a member<br>of the hospital advisory committee she<br>also held roles as Deputy chair of the<br>community and public health advisory<br>committee and was a member of the<br>covid-19 and demic governance group<br>overseeing the board's co9 response<br>between May<br>and October 2022 Moana joined the<br>university senior leadership team as kou<br>Moka and representative of the office of<br>maldi development and in this role she<br>provided critical advice on TIA Mali and<br>aspects of to moldi and Advising the<br>vice Chancellor and the senior<br>leadership team she contributed to high<br>level projects including our vision 2040<br>and in particular the T or wangi section<br>and also the TU Kitty taka rebranding<br>project and the implementation of the<br>MTI strategic framework there is so much<br>more I could continue on with but you're<br>not here to listen to me so I will<br>finish on Vision 2040 by noting that<br>Professor Theodore and her work is the<br>very embodiment of this Vision our<br>people and knowledge transforming lives<br>connecting communities and nurturing the<br>environment in oo<br>teamu the Pacific and the world it's now<br>time to hear from from Professor<br>Theodore herself one of our Stella<br>wahini in science here at the University<br>of otago please join me in welcoming<br>well it's a privilege to be here today<br>um and I never thought I would be here<br>um firstly I didn't know where ha was<br>when I was growing up uh and then once I<br>got here I didn't actually understand<br>what he had did um and then when I did<br>understand more and when I did get a PhD<br>I never thought I'd make it to Professor<br>my husband Ruben did um I did not um and<br>even after I applied for professor and<br>was promoted I wasn't sure I'd make it<br>to the inaugural<br>professorial um such has been the nature<br>of my work that Richard that Richard<br>mentioned um a colleague said to me that<br>the nature of these lectures is to talk<br>about the gravitas of one's career and<br>research um and the Pinnacle that is to<br>be professor and I take their point um<br>as traditionally that's what these<br>lectures have have been known to do but<br>for me today actually I just really want<br>to give thanks to the people that got me<br>here and the people that have kept me<br>here um<br>because um and I particularly want to<br>speak to those that were never destined<br>really to be here or weren't supposed to<br>be here um because when people like<br>myself enter into these spaces we bring<br>our communities with us and we try to<br>create space for more people like us and<br>the working class woman Marty um and<br>especially if there's a young man out<br>there tonight who thinks this all looks<br>a bit flash then my my story and my<br>journey is for you um and here we<br>are but I'm talking about this moment<br>right here I've gotten ahead of myself<br>because any life course of longitudinal<br>researcher will tell you that in order<br>to understand what's happening right now<br>you have to understand the past so in<br>order to predict the future we have to<br>understand the history<br>and as a Mari researcher that of course<br>fits really well with my own Marty World<br>Views um which are long-term in nature<br>from before birth to old age and<br>intergenerationally kamua kamudi we walk<br>backwards into the future we look to the<br>past to inform what lies ahead and so<br>I'm going to start my lecture by going<br>back in<br>time so in order to understand my career<br>and my research we go back to two small<br>vill<br>nearly a century ago at opposite ends of<br>Alor the first Village of w North taii<br>and the Bay of islands and the location<br>of the first Inland Mission Station in<br>the site of tahu ahu War my rotor lake<br>or Mari feeds my uh my hour or river<br>whitei which flows to the site where TTI<br>was signed in 1840 and it was on those<br>river banks nearly 19 years ago that my<br>n 18-year-old n was struggling in labor<br>for the first time the first twin baby<br>boy was born in the evening but a second<br>more sickly baby boy was born in the<br>early morning and that second baby my<br>dad was named tamata matanga by the<br>katua Tommy ARA my dad would also become<br>known as Tom or Tommy as well um and the<br>comat quoted from a a text at the time<br>which talked about a time of change for<br>Marty this was back in the 1930s and 40s<br>said a person should play side by side<br>the inside of the mighty expert with the<br>knowledge of the new world of the parha<br>and so despite leaving school at the age<br>of 14 my dad um was a firm believer in<br>the power of Education to change lives a<br>belief that would inform my later<br>research on higher education<br>and Ruben mentioned a faki from the<br>north<br>kak which is said at a time of<br>Celebration or joyful time that the P<br>trees of tyi are laughing and I know<br>that if my dad was here he would<br>definitely be celebrating tonight at the<br>same time that my dad was born a baby<br>girl was born in cobon in Greymouth<br>similar to my dad my mom was born into<br>very humble beginnings a little girl who<br>would lose her father who came from<br>edinara and whose middle name I share at<br>the age of three and also her beloved<br>mother at the age of six my mom would<br>later study at to become a primary<br>school teacher um and would work in the<br>native schools and then later in South<br>Oakland my mom on the<br>left and it was there that I was born in<br>South Oakland As Richard mentioned<br>middlemore Hospital partly because the<br>impacts of colonization and the need to<br>find work had affected so many like my<br>own my nana and pop akan and um Peter<br>tior who are the uh third and fourth<br>from the from the left on right up the<br>top there actually I've been told to use<br>this so people at home can follow along<br>these two sorry these two um so pop and<br>Nana um and my Faro moved to utter in<br>the late 1960s and 70s a part of the<br>Great Urban migration my grandparents<br>were establishing members of the<br>marai and my nana started the otata<br>branch of the mighty woman's Welfare<br>League and was a founding member of The<br>League she was awarded a qsm and an MBE<br>for her work with young people and their<br>farno um and in addition to having 14<br>kids um and so from a young age I saw<br>through my grandparents and my parents<br>my aunties and uncles the importance of<br>Community Based work of Faro order<br>models of health and well-being and the<br>importance of working with young people<br>in their f<br>things that would of course guide my<br>career choice I would spend my childhood<br>growing up in a and puppet toy toy and<br>although I've proudly lived in denan for<br>nearly 20 years now my research and my<br>work has been informed by those<br>communities that rais me academics would<br>say that I take a social determinance<br>approach uh to health and well-being<br>social determinance being the conditions<br>and environments where people are born<br>they live they learn they work and they<br>play<br>but how could I not looking back I would<br>come to understand that social and<br>economic policies and practices<br>practices would unfairly affect our<br>communities including our health and<br>well-being neoliberal economic reforms<br>in the 80s and 90s that left workers who<br>had flopped to South Oakland for<br>manufacturing jobs suddenly<br>unemployed resulting in high and<br>inequitable rates of unemployment for<br>the working class and in particular<br>Maran Pacifica<br>and then this was followed by social<br>welfare cuts of those newly<br>unemployed would entrench<br>intergenerational poverty and a number<br>of the health and health and social<br>issues that a number of us here are<br>working on<br>today and then of course the<br>interpersonal structural racisms that<br>went through those communities including<br>the dawn raids within our<br>neighborhoods and to counter that the<br>powerful Community responses like the<br>that would change positively change the<br>shape of Al<br>forever it's fair to say that South<br>Oakland is in the house tonight and it's<br>also<br>online c um because of a number of<br>people that have traveled here and are<br>watching um it's also fair to say that<br>University study was University was not<br>a straight path for me uh and for those<br>who I grow up with I wouldn't have gone<br>to University I'm trying to look for my<br>sister I wouldn't have gone for<br>University if it had have been for my<br>sister um Eda uh and my brother-in-law<br>Adam's footsteps she was the first in<br>Alano to go to university and I would<br>enroll there in the early<br>1990s but I would begin my research<br>career here uh as a research assistant<br>as Richard said in the psychology<br>department at Oto uni use the use the<br>mouse Warner um in the mid 90s at the<br>early learning project under a young<br>researcher a young lecturer called Dr<br>harleen Hayne um the role would ignite<br>my passion and and the understanding of<br>the importance of um childhood<br>development for later life and then in<br>late 1997 I applied for an interview job<br>at the age 26 assessments of the Denine<br>study for those who don't know much<br>about this study it's the country's<br>longest running longitudal study and<br>considered to be the world's most<br>detailed study of human health and<br>development following the lives of a<br>1037 babies that were born between the<br>1st of April 1972 and the 31st of March<br>1973 in dened and still there at age<br>three truly half a century in<br>counting back in the late but back in<br>late 1997 I clearly remember walking<br>into the old bingh and building um to be<br>interviewed by uh Dr Phil Sila the<br>studies founder and a young Dr Richie<br>pton I was 23 years old and that moment<br>would Chang my life<br>forever here's a photo of the age 26<br>assessment team uh I'm I'm here if you<br>can see that I'm uh it's it's quite a<br>strong back row actually there's Barry<br>mil that's there s rroa who's our<br>current research Dr s rroa who's our<br>current and well for a long time<br>research manager at the Denine study I<br>think Shell's in here as well you're not<br>at the back with a naughty kid Shelly<br>but there you are here and and a number<br>of others but this was us back in uh<br>1998 and at this multidisiplinary<br>leading study I learn to examine Health<br>from a multidisciplinary perspective and<br>I was fascinated because not only was I<br>learning about psychology more about<br>psychology and social science which I<br>which I had studied but also other areas<br>like cardiovascular health oral health<br>and respiratory<br>Health the first academic paper I<br>co-authored was about the long-term<br>stability of personality from age three<br>um to age 26 um that was led by<br>professors abshalom caspy and Terry<br>Moffett I mentioned my mom earlier<br>because we were cleaning out her book<br>shelf uh recently just tidying up and I<br>found this book of hers from her teacher<br>training days which reminded me of my<br>talk looking backwards to look forwards<br>um the study would find that um actually<br>children's temperament predicted uh<br>adult personality more than 20 years<br>later so for example children that were<br>um seen to be confident when they were<br>three would describe themselves as<br>unconventional um and more extroverted<br>at 26 and reserved children would grow<br>up to be more introverted and people as<br>people and people would describe them as<br>such um after the age 26 assessments as<br>Richard said I worked in the e-risk<br>study in the UK before myself and my<br>husband Ruben would return home in<br>2001 the same year that my daughter Lea<br>was born at middlemore prematurely at<br>middlemore hospital um and so I would<br>quickly learn firsthand about infant and<br>childhood development um thankfully Rea<br>developed well and she's a fourth year<br>student here at Oto so um but I<br>undertook study my PhD study in the<br>early to mid 2000s at the Oakland<br>birthweight collaborative study all of<br>the children in that particular study<br>were born at tomb but half were born<br>small for gestational<br>age in some ways mirroring my early<br>parenting experience my PhD would focus<br>on the seven-year follow-up phase when<br>the children were seven my supervisors<br>were<br>professors Ed Mitchell John Thompson and<br>Karen waly who's here today I stole this<br>off Facebook I hope that's okay your<br>Facebook I'm asking now um so yeah and<br>so uh and what did we find well to um<br>cut a long story short my work would<br>find that the development of babies that<br>were born small but at terms so 37 weeks<br>and up and particularly their cognitive<br>development was no different from the<br>children that were born uh appropriate<br>for gational age um so it was good<br>news okay having finished my PhD and<br>pregnant with my second child rupin we<br>would return to my husband's Hometown in<br>dened in 2007 and shortly after arriving<br>I would I caught up with um Richie and<br>sandre out at their home I remember I<br>had slippers on and a growing belly<br>and Richie asked me Mo what are you up<br>to now and I pointed at my belly and<br>unperturbed he said would you like a job<br>so five months pregnant I began a postto<br>that was funded by the um oo house<br>Sciences Fellowship that looked at how<br>blood pressure checked from childhood to<br>adulthood and it was a chance for me to<br>learn longitudinal trajectory modeling<br>um shout out to I don't know if jonno's<br>here shout out to jonno who had to<br>painfully sit through that with me and<br>teach me jono Jonathan Broadband um but<br>what we did is we uh we what we found<br>and I'll use the mouse again is um that<br>we were able to track from Seven all the<br>way through to 38 um people's uh blood<br>pressure and we were identified four<br>distinct developmental blood pressure<br>groups uh the were those that were in<br>the normal which was about a fifth of<br>the<br>population those in the high normal<br>which was about 44% of the population<br>uh prehypertensive about a third of the<br>population and this hypertensive group<br>and you can see it starts high and<br>continues to track high of about<br>4% what predicted being in those higher<br>risk groups having a family history of<br>high blood pressure being a male being<br>born first and low blood uh low low<br>birth weight were associated with being<br>in those high risk groups cigarette<br>smoking and having a higher body mass<br>was actually um<br>increase blood pressure for everyone but<br>particularly for those in the higher<br>risk<br>groups and the higher risk groups within<br>associated with worst cardiovascular<br>outcomes when they reach<br>38 what does all this suggest well it<br>suggest the need for prevention and<br>early intervention much earlier in the<br>life course for what are often<br>considered adult chronic<br>diseases and to follow that up I would<br>apply my newly found trajectory skills<br>to other denan study papers that I<br>co-authored that had similar findings<br>and I'm just uh led by other uh denan<br>study researchers this one here looks at<br>a body mass index from age three all the<br>way through to 38 and we were able to<br>identify four distinct development<br>groups as well and what we found is for<br>those in the higher risk groups the<br>black and the<br>blue that they were more likely they had<br>elevated risk of endo eal dysfunction uh<br>what's that it's a risk factor for<br>cardiovascular health so that's just one<br>example the second one is looking at<br>kidney function<br>trajectories um and this is the highrisk<br>group actually at the bottom which if<br>you can see it is about 6% of<br>people and they were more likely to so<br>in terms of risk factors to come from<br>lower socioeconomic backgrounds and had<br>other risk factors such as high blood<br>pressure the take-home message um that<br>what happens to you when you're young<br>your experiences in the environment you<br>grow up in has a long-term impact later<br>in life and that it also actually gets<br>under your skin in terms of your<br>physical<br>health I would have my third child in<br>2009 tour and in addition to the<br>credible support that I've always had<br>for my denan study colleagues I sought<br>out support and encouragement as an<br>early career Marty researcher leading me<br>to toot Mari the university Mari<br>academic staff caucus founded by jenta<br>and Janine Kaa an incredible group and I<br>would meet many wonderful colleagues<br>spending time together and inevitably I<br>ended up working with some for example<br>Professor Lisa timer on issues of<br>obesity for Mari at toot we also talked<br>a lot about issues of being a Marty<br>academic and how few of us there were<br>why were there so few Marty<br>shortly in 2013 as mentioned I was<br>awarded the U mer postdoctoral<br>Fellowship that I titled tamata matanga<br>how education positively affects Mary<br>health over time named after my late<br>father my postl was undertaken in two<br>larger studies one following Marty<br>University graduates within the graduate<br>longitudinal study at The Graduate study<br>in my first paper I say my these are<br>always collaborations our first paper we<br>would write about the history of<br>postcompulsory<br>education for Mar from the early 1800s<br>to<br>2010 and the policies and practices that<br>resulted in the near exclusion of Marty<br>from postcompulsory education until the<br>60s and 70s resulting in that Marty<br>working class that I talked about<br>earlier in South Oakland including in<br>South Oakland then using a<br>representative sample of University<br>graduates from<br>2011 the paper highlighted key<br>differences between Mari and non-mar<br>University graduates we found that<br>nearly half of Marty graduates were the<br>first in their family to attend<br>University as opposed to a third of<br>non-m graduates half of Marty graduates<br>would study Humanities 70% were<br>female onethird had children of the<br>Marty graduates compared to % of non-<br>Marty who who were parents and overall<br>we found that Marty were under<br>represented at that time as graduates at<br>7% and particularly as postgraduates at<br>5.8% given that Marty made up 15% of the<br>population in a follow-up survey we then<br>looked at graduate outcomes 2 years<br>postgraduation we found that the<br>employment outcomes for<br>Mii<br>Pacifica and non-adi nonp Pacifica were<br>comparable they were the same in terms<br>of employment rates and in terms of<br>incomes we did however find that Marty<br>and also Pacific graduates had<br>significantly higher student debt and<br>more financial strain postgraduation<br>which was a carry-on effect from their<br>financial situation pre- study and<br>during their<br>studies and yet conversely on the graph<br>on the left the graph on on no it's on<br>the right here um what this shows is um<br>actually what they did out in the<br>community and what we found<br>was that Maria Pacifica graduates<br>actually<br>reported um higher levels of um help and<br>higher levels of volunteerism um than<br>their non-m Mighty non-pacific<br>counterparts so you can see here that<br>they actually that's Marty they that<br>specific actually lent more money than<br>their non-pacific counterparts even<br>though they had less uh we're more<br>likely to help with official matters and<br>obviously looking after dependence as<br>well so what does this me research mean<br>overall well what we said was that<br>boosting higher education participation<br>and success for Marty and Pacifica could<br>help to reduce those labor market<br>inequalities that I talked about earlier<br>um and also private and would result in<br>private benefits for the graduates such<br>as better employment and higher income<br>but it would also result in Greater<br>societal benefits in terms of<br>volunteerism and terms of their<br>participation and in terms of the<br>support that they give that Marty and<br>back the second part of my postar was<br>working with toot turer AI Community<br>organization and the national Center for<br>life course research that was directed<br>by Richie a long-term program of<br>research<br>called we have some of the team here<br>today Gareth and others watching online<br>Ena Rose Mii and will um and this is a<br>picture of the team I did not make it<br>into the tanaki sporting Hall of Fame I<br>just I want to be honest about that it's<br>a great is a great place to take a photo<br>though um yeah so um and so this is the<br>this is the awesome team here toot our<br>partner at the governance group for Tor<br>P poro armari um early childhood<br>education center in talaki the research<br>collaboration began in 2010 and at the<br>time the Tano had completed their<br>successful research as a Ministry of<br>Education Center of innovation exploring<br>leadership and Pho development and the<br>Denine study had just completed their<br>work on<br>self-regulation in early childhood and<br>that's importance self-regulation is<br>things like having persistence delaying<br>gratification and what the study would<br>find that that was really important even<br>for health uh Health outcomes in<br>adulthood with a number of shared goals<br>we embarked on an incredible journey and<br>there have been many findings from the<br>takura my team over the years<br>jenta talked about this a little bit um<br>before in terms of the methodological<br>approaches our team has used so an<br>important part of the methodological<br>approach that we take is using an<br>interface approach what does that mean<br>our research takes place at the<br>interface between<br>mangi and Western science and we accept<br>that there's going to be some<br>differences there at the philosophical<br>level but we relocate the tension and<br>some of that to the cop upo or the<br>methodological<br>level echoing the words of that comara<br>more than 90 years ago that a person<br>should Place side by side the in inside<br>of the mighty expert with the knowledge<br>of the new world of the P kamua<br>Kami doctors ad ad TTI and Edan fille<br>have led numerous studies in this<br>project resulting in groundbreaking phds<br>that you see here um on the screen use<br>that for the people watching at home um<br>and they've kindly allowed me to present<br>on some of that research that we did<br>today for Ad 's work heura we examin the<br>positive impacts that copaa Marty early<br>life programs can have on<br>Tami what were those positive things<br>that We examined through Wanga there was<br>four constructs of interest that were<br>identified to a<br>kitty probably can't see that oh no it's<br>not too bad up there to a kitty having<br>having a secure local Marti identity<br>Faro feeling and acting as a member of<br>the Foo Community manua having<br>persistence encourage and adversity and<br>P Pono having Integrity commitment and<br>responsibility to a shared purpose or<br>co-a there is a serious lack of mar<br>specific research and Child Development<br>so not only did the team and UT UT lead<br>it have to um had to come up with the<br>identify the<br>constructs also had to create the<br>measurement tools to then measure them<br>uh and then look at whether or not cop<br>up ATI programs we're having a positive<br>impact on them<br>longitudinally and i' I think we've had<br>this discussion before we hate to reduce<br>all of that work to one graph that I<br>have<br>sorry and what you can see in this is<br>one of the measures is that you can see<br>significant positive change in all of<br>those constructs over time when we<br>measured it in preschool children over<br>five data points in a one-ear period<br>showing positive change even for a short<br>period of time and that work is now<br>being extended out across the across the<br>country supported by the HRC and MB so<br>watch this space um and of course copopa<br>Early Childhood programs don't just<br>affect the tamari that are enrolled they<br>impact on the whole far now and so 's<br>PhD t t are exam examine what impacted<br>Faro from wanting to engage in programs<br>that clearly were having this type of<br>success and she found that Faro engaged<br>because they wanted their children to<br>gain fluency<br>in and a secure Mar identity there were<br>factors that impacted positively and<br>negative negatively whether or not Foo<br>wish to engage colonization emotional<br>responses far no connection<br>institutional features cultural identity<br>and socioeconomic<br>status and she found much more and<br>unfortunately I can't go into to it<br>today but both of these phds seeing I<br>can spot a number of psychology people<br>in the audience and their related<br>Journal articles are M reads in the<br>research<br>photos in 2016 Richie would asked me to<br>become co-director of the national<br>Center of life course research it's a<br>center that partner with longitudinal<br>researches and studies across the<br>country with a focus of impacting on<br>policy and<br>practice some questioned why he would<br>put an early career<br>researcher uh into into a position of<br>leadership but he was Resolute and so<br>became my formal academic leadership<br>training and I'll give a shout out to<br>the academic leadership development<br>program to and Allison Stewart who<br>helped me with<br>that my first co- directorship task oh<br>sorry was to reapply for Center status<br>and funding and it involved me traveling<br>around the country to meet with<br>colleagues including those at the Christ<br>CH health and development study and<br>James and and Joe are here today in the<br>Pacific Islands family study there is<br>this misconception out there that we're<br>competitors these longitudinal studies<br>but I have only ever found incredible<br>support from other longitudinal<br>researchers um given that we're also<br>passionate about these studies being the<br>best kind of studies there<br>are um and alongside growing up in New<br>Zealand we're actually hugely proud that<br>New Zealand are world leaders in this<br>area um and I'm particularly excited<br>about the future work that the Denine<br>and Christ Church studies are going to<br>be doing together under the banner of<br>Oto longitudinal<br>research another part of the co-<br>directorship role that would change me<br>personally and my career forever was<br>establishing the center's Advisory Group<br>a group chaired by the wonderful<br>Emeritus Professor Richard Bedford the<br>group included Her Excellency the<br>Cindy kill a Jimmy um and Professor<br>Cliff Abraham and I couldn't have asked<br>for better advisers and mentors mentors<br>that would gently but firmly force me to<br>often face the hard questions and not<br>always take the easy road but take the<br>road in um the best Road in order to do<br>what we could and ensure that the<br>research that we were doing were going<br>to have an impact on people in<br>particular those most<br>need it was a crash course in leadership<br>um and all three remain mentors of mine<br>to this day and obviously alongside<br>Richie who is my first and longest<br>academic Mentor they've fundamentally<br>shaped<br>me uh in<br>2017 Professor David Baxter um asked me<br>to become deputy director of the Aging<br>well National Science challenge at a<br>time when the challenge was<br>strategically planning its second five<br>years and how to invench invest TR two<br>of its<br>funding working with the Aging well team<br>and alongside two of my wonderful<br>long-term colleagues Dr will Edwards and<br>associate professor Andrew SPO we would<br>undertake consultation around the<br>country with Marty to identify Marty<br>aging priorities I'm incredibly proud<br>that the Aging well challenge would then<br>support by using approximately half of<br>the contestable funding from trench 2<br>Marty aging projects and Marty<br>researchers but in 2018 I was awarded an<br>inaugural HRC Marty health research<br>emerging leader Fellowship it's quite<br>the mouthful um and I would lead the<br>deputy directorship to an incredible wah<br>and friend Professor Louise P brownley<br>who would inevitably become the Aging<br>well<br>director and I would begin my HS<br>Fellowship which continued on the work<br>that I've already talked about in that<br>research but it wasn't too long<br>afterwards that I put my name forward<br>for a role as a counselor on the Royal<br>Society tarangi a role that I held for<br>three years working alongside my fellow<br>counselors and my fellow counselor and<br>mate Professor Melinda Weber who I<br>think's watching this from the far north<br>and other wonderful counselors and<br>incredible Royal Society staff including<br>Tara Nik and Kahu we pushed within the<br>society for greater recognition of<br>marang Mari and more diverse forms of<br>research excellent<br>there's no way to solve the wicked world<br>problems that we face or truly support<br>flourishing Futures in Alor if we as<br>academics take narrow discipline and<br>eurocentric Views and I am most proud of<br>the time of from that time as an<br>initiative that we all undertook that<br>resulted in 12 Marty fellows being<br>appointed in the year 2020 um we had the<br>celebration in 2021 resulting in the<br>near doubling of<br>the number of living Marty fellows in<br>the society a team effort working<br>alongside naay to matanga and I want to<br>particularly mention Professor Angus<br>McFarland who defitely um actually drove<br>that initiative through the<br>implementation within the society's<br>academic um<br>executive okay furthering my governance<br>career I take a role as a minister at<br>appointed member of the Southern<br>District Health Board our first meeting<br>and I thought I'm going to give myself a<br>few months to learn people's name some<br>of the acronyms work<br>out where things were the meeting rooms<br>um but it was at that month's Finance<br>audit in in Risk meeting we would hear<br>about more about a Corona virus called<br>covid-19 and the far-reaching impacts<br>that it might and then inevitably had<br>earlier I spoke about the community ini<br>the Ives that I saw growing up and it<br>was again in that role that I saw<br>Community strength resilience KN how and<br>can do with wonderful leaders like<br>Gilbert toor toor who got resource out<br>to communities and worked on the ground<br>to support Grassroots<br>Solutions my fellow board member and and<br>mate tuar pori would also volun told me<br>to take a role chairing the board's<br>statutary disability support advisory<br>committee and inevitably deput in the<br>community Public Health advisory<br>committee there I would see the<br>incredible work of disability leaders<br>and experts in the launching of the<br>first disability strategy of the region<br>their work supported by the Donald<br>basley<br>Institute and I'm forever grateful to<br>have served under the late great David<br>Cole who prioritized manaen<br>relationships here in OT and also to<br>take a crash course in getting things<br>done by his successful success the<br>successor The Honorable Pete<br>Hodson to would also ask me in 2022 to<br>take a short-term position at the office<br>of MTI development working with the<br>incredible team there my role was to Lea<br>with the vice Chancellor professor at<br>the time Professor David Murdoch and the<br>senior leadership team which involved in<br>attending uh leadership team meetings<br>and advocating on behalf of OMD I saw<br>the incredible work that was being done<br>on the Tua Kitty taka project in Vision<br>2040 a document that would Place t treti<br>as a strategic priority of the highest<br>order in this<br>University Research did remain a<br>priority I promise as well um and an<br>incredible collaboration with wah and<br>formidable and passionate Professor<br>Joanna Kidman um doors Tara mallister<br>and Serana naipi alongside my<br>longsuffering Longs suffering that is<br>suffering from working with me and<br>wonderful colleague the genius that is<br>Jessy<br>kcoa um despite years of challenging<br>leaders within our universities things<br>were not changing in terms of Marty<br>staff numbers I talked about that a bit<br>earlier and our work helped to provide<br>quantitative evidence to show severe<br>underrepresentation and inqu and<br>inequities that would support other<br>people's long-term work in this area the<br>why isn't my professor Marty and Siana<br>Le the wi isn't my professor Pacifica<br>paper showed that between in a 5year per<br>period between 2012 and<br>2017 Marty made up less than 5% of the<br>total academic Workforce and less than<br>4% of professors and that had not<br>changed over<br>time then the glass ceilings paper where<br>we use data from more than 177,000<br>academics shout out again to Jesse and<br>found that Marty and Pacific men and<br>also women academics when compared to<br>non-mar non-pacific male academics had<br>sign significantly lower odds of being a<br>associate professor or professor of<br>being promoted to the professorate<br>associate professor and professor and<br>had lower earnings and importantly that<br>these differences were not explained by<br>their research performance their age or<br>field and our modeling showed that these<br>inequities would either persist or<br>increase over time unless something<br>changed Marty and Pacific um woman<br>earned nearly $18,000 less per year than<br>non-m non-pacific men and had a 65%<br>lower odds of being promoted to the<br>proph over a 15year<br>period<br>so but um it was last year that which<br>she would ask me to direct the denan<br>study the cancer that he had been living<br>with had progressed and this was to be<br>his last act as my<br>mentor supported by the study's<br>governance group led by the incomparable<br>Laura black which included Cliff<br>professors Richard Blakey Jamon howart<br>and Richard Barker who was relentless in<br>supporting me to take this role um and<br>it's a role that I feel deeply<br>privileged and honored to have directing<br>this world leading and very proudly also<br>denan based study I couldn't have asked<br>for a better team and here they are up<br>on screen of Highly committed long-term<br>star who despite suffering a tremendous<br>loss when we lost Richie in September<br>last year were determined to push<br>forward with the age 52 assessments that<br>we started in April I remember many<br>meetings last year with Sandra and sha<br>kirst and Ashley David Hannah cliff<br>amarissa and then Cody and Tony joining<br>and others like Linda here's the team<br>photo including a number of research<br>investigators some I see here tonight<br>and other folk who do so much to help us<br>and support us and in the background<br>people like Kate barard and J Taylor<br>there are too many to name but thank you<br>all in terms of the science now that I'm<br>Director people often ask me what do I<br>consider to be the most important<br>findings from the study and that's a<br>really tough call there's been 1,400<br>reports in a wide range of areas with<br>findings that have impacted on policy<br>and practice worldwide in areas like<br>Early Child education reducing childhood<br>poverty oral health it goes on and<br>on there's two findings that stand out<br>for me one on the long-term impacts of<br>of child poverty finding that children<br>that are born in socioeconomic dis<br>socioeconomically disadvantaged families<br>suffer from poor health when they reach<br>adulthood so into midlife even if their<br>situation improves as they get older so<br>even if we see that upward Mobility<br>a finding that resonates with the<br>experiences that I described earlier in<br>the neighborhoods that I grew up in<br>there's a second<br>finding and I think it speaks most uh it<br>speaks a lot to what it is to be humans<br>and that is our findings on Mental<br>Health in particular that by the time<br>the study members have reached had<br>reached the age of 45 years of age 86%<br>of them reported having had had at least<br>one diagnosable mental health condition<br>that doesn't mean that they were treated<br>but that means that they reported it and<br>you can see the high rates<br>here of Lifetime prevalence and just to<br>um show comparability those are the<br>chist JS rates as well why so high well<br>because we ask over time so people don't<br>have to remember and we've asked since<br>11 and those men mental health<br>conditions this is a busy graph but I'll<br>slowly walk us through it it's cool<br>though it looks good it's called a sanky<br>graph um these mental health conditions<br>include internalizing conditions like<br>anxiety and depression externalizing<br>like alcohol and drug dependence and<br>thought<br>disorders it conveys three things that I<br>can get them across one is that just<br>because a person has a condition at one<br>stage in their life saying eating<br>disorder when they're an adolescent that<br>they won't necessarily have it<br>throughout life and then if they do<br>suffer from another mental health<br>condition later in life it might be<br>something completely<br>different you can see the waves those<br>are the waves coming in and out the<br>second though is that people that have<br>mental health conditions early in life<br>are more likely to have them for longer<br>and more likely to have more and that<br>speaks back to that point about the need<br>for prevention and early intervention<br>and the need for youth Mental Health<br>Services as well the third thing if you<br>look at the top of the graph you can see<br>that that darker green area gets smaller<br>and smaller and smaller till it's only<br>one in 10 people that haven't reported a<br>diagnosable mental health condition in<br>their<br>mean okay I won't get you to raise your<br>hand if you're the one in 10 that has<br>I don't want to make this awkward but<br>what does it mean it means that no one<br>gets through this life<br>unscathed and it should beget compassion<br>for our fellow human beings life's not<br>easy and we know from the science that<br>we do at the Denine study we know it's<br>World leading but the team knows as well<br>it's a deeply human<br>study Sean our cohort manager has<br>described the study as seeing through<br>the lens of a thousand lives as did<br>Richie<br>the tragedies and the triumphs the highs<br>and the lows I meet with study members<br>and I now and I ask them why they<br>participate these exchanges can be<br>light-hearted and hum and humorous they<br>can also be deeply profound a study<br>member said to me that a life worth<br>living is a life worth<br>recording as others have called this<br>work their legacy their contribution to<br>humanity that they want to make a<br>difference and they want to make it<br>better for their children and their<br>grandchildren children that they want to<br>help solve the questions our big<br>questions on health and aging many will<br>say I've just always done it and I'll<br>just keep on doing it as long as you'll<br>have me they selflessly participate<br>without reward describing themselves as<br>anonymously famous or the famous baby<br>Society what I also love about the study<br>is that each and every study member is<br>important as the person sitting next to<br>them regardless of what their perceived<br>status is out in society and how Society<br>treats them as they walk back out those<br>doors we see more than 90% of study<br>members which we see which means we see<br>people from all walks of<br>life and I also love that the denum<br>community has held and uplifted the<br>study for half a<br>century thank you very similar to those<br>Community initiatives I saw growing<br>up there's a saying that you cannot bad<br>relationship your way to good data it is<br>only through good relationships that you<br>get good data and that's why our study<br>values are so<br>important we treat people as we would<br>want to be treated so the study members<br>are the true heroes of this study<br>secondly in order to understand human<br>lives we must take a multidisciplinary<br>and Equity based<br>approach we strive for research<br>excellence and all we do and that is we<br>take a very broad definition of what<br>that means in terms of excellence and<br>finally and importantly that the gift<br>that these study members have given for<br>half a century has to make a difference<br>in the lives of others that's what they<br>ask us to do and that's what we work to<br>do okay I'm going to end my speech in<br>two ways after I've adjusted my quar wi<br>um firstly I want to say some more thank<br>yous I've already given a few shoutouts<br>but I'm going to say some more again I'd<br>like to thank the team and the<br>researchers and the non-researchers that<br>I've worked with past and<br>present U I would not be the person that<br>I am today he looked<br>up he sat to he sat to attention<br>then good work um I would not be the<br>person that I am today nor would I be<br>encouragement my smart strong eldest<br>child Ren in my smart fascinating middle<br>child and tore my smart and passionate<br>youngest child child adanu Koto this<br>work is for you I've already mentioned a<br>number of people there's still more to<br>mention the theor and torano watching<br>online the Kent family Heather and the<br>kids watching at home C to the yanis and<br>Flores funo I've spotted you there my<br>in-laws here in denan we say Mama and<br>Nana s but Glenda Skipper and N Sally<br>Parker and glender made this beautiful<br>cway that I'm wearing today and my late<br>father-in Jeb<br>Skipper who is here and the skipper we<br>are poano at up<br>north I have friends um online and those<br>here today including henah and Andrea<br>thank you for uplifting me and holding<br>me<br>down someone advised me that if I was<br>going to say something that would make<br>me cry to leave it till the end wise<br>advice so I'd like to dedicate this<br>lecture<br>to someone who had planned to attend<br>today but could no longer<br>travel my best friend<br>Tina who I've known since I was<br>11 Tina we've walked through many fires<br>together and now we walk through this<br>fire you know all parts of me so you<br>know that I like a good Meme and I saw<br>one recently that reminded me of you it<br>said you clapped so loudly for my<br>accomplishments that I didn't notice<br>that others weren't clapping<br>I want to send love today to to you to<br>Bruce Bailey Jude and the family<br>watching<br>online I love you thank you thank you<br>thank God for you you've been The Wind<br>Beneath My<br>Wings finally to the<br>Future it goes without saying that the<br>Denine cud is committed to keeping this<br>study going for as long as the study<br>members keep coming in and they've told<br>us they want to participate until they<br>die at age 52 we are focusing more and<br>more on Aging in order to understand and<br>better support everyone to age well<br>including reducing inequities in age<br>related<br>conditions as for the future more<br>generally I look towards the year<br>2040 200 years since the signing of<br>tetti and I think about the type of<br>country that I want for my children and<br>grandchildren and those still to come<br>and then I look to the past my sisters<br>who signed on the day in 1840 and my dad<br>who I talked about earlier who was a<br>5-year-old at the 100e celebrations at<br>White hangi in<br>1940 and I reflect on the words of the<br>late kingu ha here who said we need to<br>focus on getting in the Walker and<br>working together growing together is<br>crucial we've come a long way as a<br>country and we can go either even<br>further let's not give up now the treaty<br>provides a foundation for us all to work<br>work together there is much work still<br>to be done taking learnings from the<br>car today<br>f<br>just going to switch off my mic so I'm<br>not the loudest sing<br>now if I can find<br>it I just switch off my mic I'm just GNA<br>my<br>May oh<br>k<br>oh<br>King<br>more<br>speee<br>foree<br>my name is AR and I want I'm very<br>privileged to be able to say something<br>small something to add to the quarter of<br>moas in terms of the Mari<br>Community Western science M Mari<br>interface approach that I can add to<br>that little bit but in doing so I<br>believe it honors all that Moana has<br>done and is going to do because we're<br>working<br>together um I first met Moana in<br>2011 through<br>Richie um and a year earlier Richie and<br>I had been um appointed to the<br>ministerial review of early<br>childhood and uh at that time Mo rightly<br>recalled that that major finding around<br>self-control self-regulation had just<br>come<br>out um a key question that Richie and<br>others were pondering at the time was<br>Could you teach<br>self-control and so in the time that I<br>was working with Richie on the<br>ministerial review he found out a little<br>about a little bit about our community<br>organization which is a cop early years<br>education<br>setting um what I didn't realize is that<br>um you know how fast his brain would<br>work um he fast forwarded to basically<br>one comment to me which is we've got to<br>work together we've got to do some<br>research together and I was going yeah<br>sure that's cool so um fast forward<br>about I'm going to say a few months and<br>all of us sudden we were uh presenting<br>at the intervention Symposium in<br>Wellington in 2011<br>and that was where I met MOA for the<br>first<br>time um however<br>um the interesting thing is that um even<br>though I just met her I actually knew<br>her very well because Richie talked<br>about her so much and actually it was<br>more than talked about her it was he had<br>such such a high regard for you Moana<br>and so when I actually met Moana I was<br>in a of her because and she was this<br>very high person in my books and I<br>hadn't even embarked on any um PhD study<br>or anything at that time so um you know<br>I was thinking scary<br>awesome um yeah and a scholar focused on<br>excellence and also um<br>uh in that um what do you call it<br>quantitative research research space<br>that we've all in this collaboration of<br>TTI um been exposed to thank you Jesse<br>um<br>so we started our research together and<br>what emerged<br>was the key thing about the interface<br>approach which we actually learned as we<br>went along is that um we just got on<br>with it it wasn't anyone was better or<br>higher than anybody else it was that we<br>had work to do and let's do it um it was<br>actually a dynamic collaborative<br>effort uh it was you know we never<br>operated as two different organizations<br>working together on a research project<br>we operated sort of like a farno it was<br>a powerful collaboration it was high<br>trust it was respect and it was utoh<br>high rolled into one every colleague<br>brought together their knowledge skill<br>and expertise but there was humility we<br>had challenging<br>conversations but what happened out of<br>that and is still happening because<br>we're in at the end point of our data<br>collection of our full study which<br>involves as Mona said centers around the<br>country um you know it's creating<br>importantly there was a negotiation and<br>navigation of power in that<br>conversation um that has been the<br>Bedrock of our research and I would say<br>interface research that's the Bedrock of<br>interface research between Western<br>science and mamari but MOA can I<br>say the esteem that we hold you in our<br>Little Mighty Community organization<br>ourselves I'm so proud and humbled to be<br>able to stand and say something to you<br>and be able to Mii to you<br>tonight our relationship goes far beyond<br>um um trust and Beyond academic um<br>Endeavor research Endeavor um you know<br>like what we we actually have an<br>extended vano in the room we've got<br>Sandia we've got prianka<br>um<br>Reuben rupini TOA we got Sam<br>Gareth um you know like we've visited<br>each other's homes we've spent time<br>we've shared Kai we've had conversation<br>and lots of<br>laughter I'm just appreciated of the all<br>of the work that and the guidance that<br>you've given me personally on my journey<br>so I want to M to you so it has been a<br>privilege and an honor to be able to<br>stand here to and to know you and long<br>TOA hello everyone my name is Cliff<br>Abram I'm here to represent the<br>department of<br>psychology<br>tarakam hinar uh in this wonderful<br>proceedings<br>uh it's actually been uh I'm here on<br>behalf of Jamon halat uh who's head of<br>Department unfortunately he can't be<br>here but he sends his best wishes and um<br>for this wonderful event uh he's sorry<br>he can't be here um but he's he's proud<br>to be um the head of Department of the<br>best department of psychology in the<br>molu just saying completely unbiased<br>observation that Moana makes such a<br>great uh contribution to and that's part<br>of the reason uh now it's been about 20<br>years since I was head of department so<br>um I haven't done this for a while so<br>I'm going to get out my cheat sheet um<br>thank you so much for your words very<br>beautiful um thoughts there and of<br>course thank you<br>Moana for your excellent and deeply<br>inspiring uh<br>lecture I'll come back to that more in a<br>moment but I just want to I just want to<br>recap some of the things that you've<br>heard already uh maybe add a little bit<br>little bit more um because I'm I am<br>speaking with the lens of the Department<br>of psychology so we can go back to to<br>your doing a a diploma postgrad diploma<br>of Arts quite some time ago um but also<br>um she was cutting her teeth um there<br>shortly after at the denan study as a<br>researcher Junior<br>researcher you had no idea what you what<br>that was going to mean um but um since<br>then and after completing your PhD and<br>coming back from the UK she's played an<br>increasingly important role in the life<br>of the department<br>um as you've heard as a co-investigator<br>of the Denine study both before and<br>after it transferred to the<br>department um as a collaborator of many<br>staff in the<br>department um as a mentor of many early<br>career<br>researchers um bringing her deep<br>knowledge of T Mari and matanga Mari uh<br>to the department as a promoter of<br>equity for Mali and as a supporter of<br>longitudinal research efforts um right<br>across M through her role as co-director<br>of the national Center of life course<br>research I I I will say that that work<br>is not<br>done we uh we we need more of that still<br>going<br>forward and how how youve also found<br>time to undertake governance roles at<br>the sdhb the<br>APPA aari um aging well other entities<br>actually is a mystery to me<br>but this speaks not just to her<br>mysterious ways but to her energy her<br>Devotion to Excellence and her drive to<br>make a difference for aloa uh through<br>research and<br>policy now Professor promotion Professor<br>is not just about<br>Excellence according to the rule book<br>it's about sustained outstanding<br>leadership and competence in across<br>teaching research and service so that's<br>the bar for this<br>promotion and I think you would agree<br>that this has well been well<br>encapsulated by her presentation<br>today and thank you Mona for sharing<br>with us your journey with such Clarity<br>and<br>passion all of us here have no doubt<br>that you have soared above that bar in<br>Academia personally I've known Mona for<br>quite a long time but very much<br>increasingly so the last few years<br>actually in recent years since I now<br>consider her a great friend and first of<br>all through my own connection with the<br>national Center of life course<br>research and then my increasing<br>connection with the nine<br>study taking on the directorship of the<br>denan study is no small step I can tell<br>you and not one to be taken lightly and<br>not just by<br>anyone so speaking for myself but more<br>importantly on behalf<br>of all her National International<br>colleagues of the department oh by the<br>way hello everybody zooming in National<br>colleagues International colleagues I<br>know you're there um for the<br>department and um particularly on behalf<br>of the wonderful study<br>participants we are in equal parts<br>thrilled<br>honored and indebted to you for taking<br>role it's hard to think of anyone else<br>so well qualified and able to do the job<br>and that's a<br>fact I should note that taking this step<br>gave Moana about six weeks to write two<br>not one but two HRC Grant<br>applications uh to gain funding for the<br>phase as is currently running and<br>Beyond and watching this unfold took me<br>back about 40<br>years to when I decided to take six<br>I I finished just just about limping<br>across the line Moana on the other hand<br>you've been winning and what a huge<br>achievement that is in such a short<br>space c CA CI walking backwards into the<br>future it's an appropriate perspective<br>given moano fakap Papa and her<br>investment in and Leadership of a<br>longitudinal study that's been 50 years<br>in the making<br>but don't be<br>fooled like any good mom she has eyes in<br>the back of her<br>head so while she's looking backwards<br>she's looking equally well forward into<br>the<br>future and she's envisioning and now<br>implementing how the study can evolve to<br>increase its ability to address equity<br>T Good Will towards others is a precious<br>treasure this is something that I know<br>is ingrained in how Moana approaches her<br>roles so to our own<br>treasure thank you for your address<br>today and congratulations on your<br>so I'll just wait forone to come down so<br>join them if you know it um to uh<br>and<br>it<br>I hope you see how much your department<br>loves<br>you so the to finish off we have a small<br>achievements so that just leaves me to<br>um invite you to the afterm match uh<br>which is going to be held at the staff<br>Club just a acoss the road for some Kai<br>Mayo so hope to see you there and can<br>carry on conversations and continue<br>congratul</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
