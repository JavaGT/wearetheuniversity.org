cover<br>the four key areas listed on the screen<br>so we'll talk about what Enterprise risk<br>management is the difference between<br>risk and an issue the risk context for a<br>Targo University and how we manage risk<br>within aargo<br>University risk management is something<br>we intuitively do every day um an<br>example would be just drying the laundry<br>after we've done the washing there are<br>objectives there are risks and there are<br>controls Enterprise risk management<br>takes this Common Sense approach and<br>makes it more formal and implements it<br>in a systemic and systematic way to<br>ensure that outcomes are more<br>consistent Enterprise risk management<br>can be scaled up so it can represent the<br>risks that an organization faces as a<br>whole or it can be scaled down to<br>divisions or departments or even<br>responsibilities there's a direct<br>relationship between risks and issues a<br>risk is something that may happen in the<br>future and organizations seek to avoid<br>that risk by implementing<br>controls an issue is the outcome of a<br>risk that has already eventuated so it's<br>a risk that hasn't been managed as well<br>as we'd like it to and therefore a<br>negative consequence has happened and<br>that's the issue and that requires a<br>reactive<br>response Enterprise risk management is<br>interested in the cause and the context<br>of the issue rather than managing the<br>issue the issue has already happened and<br>that should be managed locally but from<br>a risk management perspective we need to<br>find out why that issue came about and<br>what can we do to stop it happening in<br>the future and indeed what can what<br>controls can we Implement to stop it<br>getting worse now if we go back to the<br>uh the the task of drying the laundry if<br>all those controls that we had listed<br>failed repeatedly we'd have to consider<br>a new control and perhaps we would buy a<br>tumble dryer and only ever dry the<br>washing in a tumble dryer therefore<br>outside when we talk about the context<br>of risk for a taro University as I said<br>in earlier slides the first thing we<br>have to do is consider the objectives of<br>the university and then what we can do<br>is we can identify the areas that<br>University Works in and the things that<br>it has to manage and the things it has<br>to deliver and then we can help to<br>identify what could possibly go wrong in<br>those areas and the one to eight<br>examples that I've listed just give an<br>indication of some of the Strategic<br>risks that at TGO university has to<br>basis a Targo University manages risks<br>in a similar way to most other<br>organizations that follow follow uh ASN<br>Z standard 31,000 2018 so it's a<br>structured format not surprisingly it<br>begins with identification of the risk<br>but this isn't as simple as it might<br>sound it requires collaboration with<br>wider stakeholders and it requires an<br>in-depth understanding of the Strategic<br>objectives and the the key performance<br>indicators that we have to achieve but<br>also the environment that we work<br>in risk assessment is the process of<br>scoring the risk and the first thing we<br>need to consider is what's the worst<br>realistic outcome what's the consequence<br>if if this risk actually happens and<br>then we consider the likelihood what's<br>the probability of that particular worst<br>outcome eventuating and that gives us a<br>score which we can you we can measure in<br>the risk<br>Matrix the first score that we get is<br>what we call an an initial an initial<br>risk score this imagines that there are<br>no controls in place to prevent the risk<br>from from<br>happening once we've done that we repeat<br>the exercise but this time we do<br>consider the controls that we have in<br>place what do we currently have in place<br>to stop that worst realistic outcome<br>from taking place it's important that we<br>use the same worst realistic outcome so<br>that we're comparing apples with apples<br>and the the score that we get this time<br>is the residual risk score and this is<br>the important score for the organization<br>it represents the actual score that<br>we're currently exposed<br>to once we've assessed the risk score we<br>can then decide what we're going to do<br>about it we could do nothing we can<br>apply further controls we could transfer<br>the risk through insurance or<br>Contracting the task out quite often<br>those transfer um controls are only<br>effective for financial risks and if we<br>can avoid the task completely then<br>perhaps we can eliminate the risk but<br>that's rarely the<br>case once the risks are recorded and the<br>controls and the treatments are are in<br>place we need to review and monitor<br>those risks in an ongoing basis so that<br>we can identify any changes that may<br>have taken place and we can amend our<br>plan accordingly and we can also test<br>our control to make sure they're working<br>effectively so this presentation has<br>been a really high level and quick<br>introduction to Enterprise risk<br>management what have we looked at well<br>we know what an Enterprise risk<br>management initiative is now and it's<br>simply an extension of the intuitive<br>risk management that we all do every<br>day it's important that we work and<br>collaborate with our wider stakeholders<br>and we give people a voice and input<br>into the risk management exercise<br>because their information is vital so<br>that we can identify risk and also<br>measure the<br>risk if we Implement risk management<br>effectively we'll find that we meet our<br>obis and Targets in a much more linear<br>format uh we won't be zigzagging from<br>problem to problem and therefore we'll<br>save time and<br>money the resources of an organization<br>need to be focused on the highest risks<br>first<br>most risks can't be avoided we have a<br>job to do we've got to do it in a<br>certain way um and we've got certain<br>locations and certain activities that<br>can't be changed so with that in mind we<br>have to consider what controls we can<br>put in place to reduce the level of risk<br>that we<br>Face a control is something that's<br>actually implemented today it's<br>happening it's it's it's something we've<br>done already it's not something that's<br>planned to be done whilst plans future<br>plans are incredibly important and<br>should be recorded so that we can<br>progress track the um the development of<br>those plans and the<br>implementation those plans will not<br>reduce a risk today the only things that<br>can reduce risk right now are the<br>controls that are in place so it's<br>important that we distinguish between<br>the<br>two I hope this has been informative<br>thank you for taking the time to uh work<br>through the presentation if you have any<br>questions concerns suggestions I'd love<br>to hear from you uh so please me and I<br>hope to see you and speak to you in the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
