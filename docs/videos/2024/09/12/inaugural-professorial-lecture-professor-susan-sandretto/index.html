the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor academic and it's<br>a great pleasure to welcome you to this<br>very special occasion to celebrate the<br>promotion of Susan sandretto to<br>professor at the University of<br>atago these lectures are a highlight of<br>my week as I'm sure they are of many of<br>yours too they're a wonderful<br>opportunity for us to come together and<br>listen to our new professors talk about<br>their personal Journeys their research<br>platform and the impact their research<br>has had on<br>others I'd like to welcome colleagues<br>students and friends from across the<br>university and Beyond including those<br>joining us tonight via live<br>stream I'd like to give special welcome<br>to Su Susan's family who are with us<br>here in person this evening to Scot her<br>husband to Tess her daughter to Marshall<br>her boner<br>son to Gary her father-in-law to Kay her<br>mother-in-law and to Caleb her<br>son-in-law I'd also like to welcome<br>those members of her family who are<br>joining us via live stream to Susan's<br>parents rod and Bev to her sister Carol<br>who'll be watching uh from<br>California to Susan's son jack and her<br>partner Josie who'll be tuning in from<br>Wellington<br>to Susan's bonus daughter Jordan along<br>with Freddy Susan's grandson and star of<br>her IPL<br>poster Susan's sister-in-law Tracy and<br>her partner Scott Susan's sister-in-law<br>Michelle and her husband Paul watching<br>all the way from Canterbury and Susan's<br>well it's not easy to become a professor<br>at the University of atago in order to<br>be promoted to that level candidates<br>need to show that they're outstanding in<br>EV every one of three categories<br>teaching research and service Professor<br>sandretto has clearly met these th these<br>three<br>criteria it's an honor and a privilege<br>to congratulate her tonight for that<br>outstanding achievement and I hope<br>you'll join me in doing the same now and<br>if I didn't have a microphone in my hand<br>I'd be clapping hard so please if I<br>together and and I hope you'll take<br>every opportunity this evening to do do<br>more of<br>that uh in her lecture tonight Professor<br>sandretto argues for a broad<br>conceptualization of literacy one that<br>will prepare our young children for the<br>texts of today as well as the texts of<br>tomorrow she draws on evidence from<br>projects with teachers and students in<br>primary and secondary schools looking at<br>critical literacy critical<br>multiliteracies and<br>misinformation in making her case she<br>argues that on their own the traditional<br>practices of reading and writing are no<br>longer efficient to ensure successful<br>meaning making and communication across<br>the wide range of context students are<br>facing today and are likely to encounter<br>in the<br>future in the process Professor<br>sandretto will also reflect on her<br>academic career to tell us a little bit<br>about her own personal Journey she'll<br>tell us about the impact of her research<br>on the profession and her teaching and<br>most importantly on her<br>students but before Professor sandretto<br>does that I'll hand over to Professor<br>Jessica Palmer Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>external Eng engagement and until very<br>recently the provice cha Chancellor from<br>the division of humanities to formally<br>introduce professor sandretto and give<br>you a little more detail about her<br>academic<br>background thank you Jessica<br>Kato it's lovely to be here with you all<br>this evening I have the great pleasure<br>of actually passing the Bon onto the<br>dean of Education who's going to be<br>providing tonight's introduction so<br>please welcome Aang Eva<br>promoted you can have<br>mine<br>in a very warm welcome it's really<br>lovely to see you here um tonight family<br>members colleagues and Friends of<br>Professor s Susan sandri<br>and those who are online um some from<br>far away so it's really wonderful to<br>have you here to celebrate Susan's<br>promotion to<br>Professor my name is lvan Anderson I'm<br>the dean of T AKO TAA the College of<br>Education so it's such a privilege to<br>provide a very brief introduction to<br>Professor Susan sano's inaugural<br>professorial lecture it's quite a<br>mouthful Susan began her professional<br>life as an elementary school teacher in<br>a Spanish Immersion program in Northern<br>California and she has a really rich and<br>eclectic CV which I expect we'll hear a<br>little bit more about tonight she's<br>worked as a tutor in the former denan<br>College of Ed uh faculty of Education<br>mathematics sorry denan College of<br>Education mathematics Department an<br>assistant lecturer in the former faculty<br>of Education a research assistant for<br>aangi Russell Bishop who many of us know<br>well um and Junior research fellow in<br>the higher education development center<br>before finding an academic home at<br>and<br>faka so Susan CV demonstrates amazing<br>versatility as a researcher and an<br>education scholar and her capacity to<br>collaborate with a really wide range of<br>people Susan has partnered with national<br>and international colleagues in areas<br>spanning Health policy education initial<br>teacher education and more recently<br>journalism Susan will tell us more about<br>her research but I'd just like to<br>acknowledge her as a person and as a<br>colleague Susan is a wonderful academic<br>citizen she's someone who's generous<br>with her time and expertise she's<br>willing to do hard things when they need<br>to be done and she's brilliant at<br>mentoring others Susan is an exceptional<br>teacher and a gifted postgraduate and<br>doctoral supervisor and her CV includes<br>an eye-watering range of service roles<br>and contributions to National and<br>international scholarly associations<br>scholarly journals educational<br>associations and schools from 2022 to<br>2023 Susan was<br>anumang or teamw writer in the English<br>learning area for the Ministry of<br>Education as part of the previous<br>government's curriculum refresh work she<br>was nominated for this role by the New<br>Zealand literacy Association it's a<br>really prestigious thing to be asked to<br>do I have been really looking forward to<br>this IPL so Susan's work on the place of<br>future focused critical literacies in<br>education is increasingly important in<br>an era of Miss and disinformation where<br>national leaders cherry-pick and ignore<br>evidence to suit their own agendas and<br>denigrate those who call them to account<br>as I went on leave in May this year a<br>report was released um in Alo New<br>Zealand claiming that new teachers were<br>unprepared to teach and that initial<br>teacher education programs such as our<br>own are failing the education system<br>fortunately I'd asked Susan to be acting<br>Dean<br>and I couldn't have had a better person<br>to step up for that particular moment<br>Susan swung into action with her<br>characteristic calm putting her critical<br>literacy hat on uh to engage with the<br>media and to calm staff and counter the<br>misuse of very poor quality data at our<br>expense she also demonstrated her<br>exceptional qualities as a leader and<br>this has continued and in response to<br>the Coalition government's changes to<br>literacy teaching which have been very<br>quickly push through Susan set up a<br>reading club a College of Education<br>reading group where colleagues can<br>explore research evidence on literacy<br>teaching and learning together and share<br>questions and ideas and this club is<br>also leading external Outreach work in<br>the literacy space its next meeting will<br>be used to prepare a collective response<br>to the current Ministry of education's<br>recently released draft English<br>curriculum for years 0 to six so Susan<br>thank you for being who you are in our<br>space and for all of the wonderful work<br>you do we're really thrilled to<br>celebrate this promotion with you<br>tonight which is super well-deserved and<br>we look forward to hearing what you have<br>Rodney sand to Papa Beverly sand to Mama<br>Co Carol sand singer<br>toik KES Wing R Co Jack Wing Co Jordan<br>slipper Co Marshall cler akar<br>Freddy slipper<br>msan sand<br>tooto tenot<br>ten thank you all for<br>coming so much this evening so<br>professors and esteemed guests thank you<br>very much thank you to the family and<br>friends and guests who are took the time<br>to attend here in person this evening<br>thank you to the friends and family who<br>are watching live online and to those<br>who might tune in later to watch the<br>recording at a more suitable time I've<br>structured this evening's talk into two<br>parts firstly who am I and how did I get<br>here as mentioned in my Micki I'm<br>originally from Northern California I've<br>been in OT poti for 27 years now I<br>explained when I introduced myself that<br>I moved 7,000 miles or 11,500 km to live<br>in a place that looks just like home<br>think Rocky coasts macra carpa Roda<br>Summers I come from a family of teachers<br>great-grandmother grandmother Auntie and<br>Uncle here I am going to school with my<br>grandmother um for the day but I didn't<br>want to become a teacher despite what my<br>mother told me um it seems however that<br>I couldn't escape my DNA I loved books<br>and I enjoyed school and apologies to my<br>longsuffering younger sister sister<br>Carol for Endless rounds of playing<br>school I began my studies at humble<br>State University as an Undeclared major<br>I wasn't really certain I what I wanted<br>to do hanging on to the I'm not going<br>teaching fun fact amongst the list of<br>Pros when deciding to transfer from<br>Humble State University now Kyle Paulie<br>Hult to the University of California<br>Davis was I wouldn't have to take a<br>speech class then I decided to become a<br>as I prepared to complete my double<br>degree at the University of Davis in<br>Psychology and Spanish I thought I would<br>study to become a high school Spanish<br>teacher to apply for my teacher<br>education program I needed some<br>experience so I went to Joan wink the<br>mother of one of my flatmates and now<br>professor emeritus who is the bilingual<br>education coordinator for the Davis<br>Joint Unified School District she gently<br>suggested that my Spanish proficiency at<br>the time wasn't quite ready for high<br>school Spanish<br>she placed me as a volunteer with a<br>first grade bilingual teacher Judy<br>howerin I think she steered me in that<br>direction on purpose and I'm ever<br>grateful for it bilingual education in<br>California was and always will be a<br>political undertaking a contest for<br>social justice Joan remains a fierce<br>advocate for ad additive bilingualism<br>that's where you add a second language<br>to your first rather than asking you to<br>erase your first first language in order<br>to add it and she is also a fierce<br>justice during my time with Judy's first<br>grade class I got hooked I got hooked in<br>by the gorgeous first graders navigating<br>two tongues and the teachers who would<br>not subtract what these children were<br>bringing with them to school and Judy<br>would later become a colleague I applied<br>to the bilingual bicultural teacher<br>education program at California State<br>University Sacramento but before I went<br>I spent the summer in Costa Rica with<br>Amigos deas Americas a powerful<br>immersion in espanol balanced with<br>important lessons and<br>privilege during my teacher education<br>program my visiting lecturer Professor<br>Jose syron planted a seed when you do<br>your<br>Masters I didn't know anyone with a<br>master's degree but I did love school<br>and I loved learning after I'd been<br>teaching for a couple of years I<br>returned to California State University<br>Sacramento to complete my Master's<br>Degree and Professor synthon was my<br>supervisor Jose just retired recently<br>after many years of teaching the<br>critical Multicultural education course<br>at CSU Sacramento he is another tireless<br>advocate for additive bilingual programs<br>justice my first foray into research<br>came from my wonderings<br>I was teaching in the Central Valley of<br>California in Davis in a dual Spanish<br>English immersion program in my third<br>grade class 80% of the school year was<br>in Spanish and 20% in English following<br>a Canadian French immersion model I had<br>students whose first language was<br>Spanish and students whose first<br>language was English it was an additive<br>program but I wondered why weren't there<br>more native uh Spanish speakers in my<br>class so I roped in some bilingual<br>friends to help me conduct a telephone<br>survey to find out we spoke with 90% of<br>the Spanish-speaking families in the<br>district only 30% had their children<br>enrolled in the Spanish Immersion<br>program the majority of the families<br>felt strongly about having their<br>children become bilingual but only 20%<br>of the families had the Spanish<br>Immersion program in their neighborhood<br>so recommendations included no cost or<br>lowcost busing increasing the<br>proportions of English instruction to<br>address parental concerns around<br>students English proficiency when they<br>went on to middle school and increased<br>attention to community involvement and<br>student<br>recruitment I never published or<br>presented the results from that study I<br>think that's their first<br>outing I didn't really understand<br>academic po publishing or know where to<br>start but I wasn't finished with school<br>or with research i' had been telling my<br>students for years that when I grow up<br>teachers we moved to Alo in New Zealand<br>when my daughter Tess was 2 months old<br>after two years as a spectacularly<br>unsuccessful stay-at-home mother Tess<br>went to daycare and I went to work at<br>the University of aago as a research<br>assistant working with Professor Ruth<br>Kaine who is now at the University of<br>Ottawa and Professor Chris Heath who's<br>joined us here tonight I loved the work<br>I loved all the new learning endnote<br>power Point stimulated recall interviews<br>fantastic but after a couple of years I<br>knew I needed to stop doing research for<br>other people and start doing my own Ruth<br>agreed to be my supervisor along with<br>Professor Keith<br>Ballard my social justice read thread or<br>theme continued a group of teacher<br>Educators at the University of atago and<br>at the University of w agreed to<br>participate in a collaborative self<br>study where we worked alongside each<br>other to explore for our beliefs and<br>practices around teaching for social<br>justice as Viv mentioned in my<br>introduction Professor Russell bishop<br>and his family would host me during my<br>trips to Hamilton and I also did some ra<br>work for him learning so much about<br>conducting research in the AO and New<br>Zealand context like nearly all PhD<br>Journeys it was not entirely smooth I<br>wisely decided to begin the month my son<br>jack was born I figured well it's not<br>going to get any easier you might as<br>well just get on with it and I did I<br>graduated in 2004 gaining a lecturing<br>position at the faculty of Education the<br>are I am immensely grateful to all of<br>these mentors who guided me on my path<br>to be here in front of you all today<br>it's been a long and Winding Road many<br>of my New Zealand Foo have joined me<br>this evening here and online as seen in<br>the photos to the right and my to my<br>friends and family online or W watching<br>later on thank you for your support you<br>can see my California Foo on the left I<br>am grateful every day to work with<br>teachers students and amazing<br>colleagues supported by my family<br>My Success is not mine it comes from the<br>collective I might be standing up here<br>on my lome in front of you all tonight<br>but there is a cast of thousands that<br>possible part<br>two which brings us to part two now I'm<br>going to draw on my resch search post<br>PhD to present a case for future facing<br>literacies the training that I completed<br>during my doctorate particularly in<br>collaborative ways of conducting<br>research prepared me well for the next<br>phase I also brought along my red thread<br>of social justice I would be remiss if I<br>didn't acknowledge the role the teaching<br>and learning research initiative has<br>played in supporting my research into<br>critical literacy and critical<br>multiliteracies over the years there are<br>few sources of funding for educational<br>researchers in altero New Zealand and<br>the t is vital particularly important in<br>my view is the way in which they value<br>teacher practical knowledge as<br>contributing to<br>research and I would be remiss if I<br>didn't acknowledge my dear colleague and<br>friend Jane Tilson this is where we get<br>the tissues out Jane and I won our first<br>tlri in 2005 working with four teachers<br>teachers from two schools to explore<br>understandings and pedagogies for<br>critical literacy I expanded the project<br>to work with more schools and more<br>teachers and after a sojourn in England<br>thanks Phillip Jane and I collaborated<br>again on another two-year T TL r i<br>examining critical<br>multiliteracies but first we need to<br>context of this evening's lecture the<br>latest incarnation of the reading Wars<br>unlike what the split ends claim in<br>their song history does<br>repeat many of you listening are<br>probably aware that currently here in<br>Alo New Zealand there is a great deal of<br>a debate about how best to teach<br>children how to read it is playing out<br>in the news social media and within the<br>Ministry of Education the debate is a<br>global one playing out all around the<br>world it's constructed as a binary<br>debate phonics in the guise of<br>structured approaches to teaching<br>reading versus whole language when<br>something is constructed as a binary it<br>is a black or white Choice there are<br>losers but I will argue this evening<br>that literacy is much more complicated<br>than it's being portrayed in the media<br>and the current discussions favoring<br>particular pedagogies or approaches to<br>teaching reading but first I want to<br>unpack a few characters I've said that<br>tonight's lecture is about making a case<br>for future facing literacy so let's<br>start with thinking about the<br>future when we talk about education we<br>frequently invoke visions of the future<br>in response to students questions why<br>are we doing this the response often<br>goes something like you'll need it in<br>the<br>future but do we really know what this<br>future is is the future inevitable or do<br>we have a hand in it is it a problem to<br>be solved or can we be involved involved<br>in constructing it I suggest that what<br>we do right now is actively building the<br>future it is an active Dynamic and<br>ongoing process but it is a constrained<br>process we Face unprecedented challenges<br>on a global scale that is the global<br>connected with the<br>local these challenges come in the form<br>of economic environmental health and<br>fragile democracies<br>educational policy has taken various<br>approaches to this future<br>conundrum in the current New Zealand<br>curriculum one of the principles for<br>curriculum design is future<br>focused and this suggests that schools<br>will Design curriculum in order that<br>students can explore this an errow<br>report the education Review Office five<br>years after implementing the current New<br>Zealand curriculum suggested we didn't<br>seem to have realized it very well it is<br>unclear if the refresh of the refreshed<br>curriculum will explicitly address<br>curriculum design for the future one<br>thing the draft English learning area<br>years 0 to6 curriculum circulating for<br>consultation currently emphasizes is<br>knowledge and the importance of a<br>knowledge Rich curriculum using the term<br>knowledge 151<br>times Rachel bolad along with her<br>colleagues Jane Gilbert Sue McDow Ali<br>bull Sally boydd and rosemary hip<br>Hipkins from the New Zealand Council of<br>educational research suggest we can<br>think about knowledge as a noun or a<br>verb I suggest that knowledge in the<br>draft learning English learning area for<br>the most part is positioned as a<br>noun for instance students will build<br>knowledge acquire knowledge apply<br>knowledge however understanding<br>knowledge as a verb as a thing is<br>limiting because we are then educating<br>students to learn what is already known<br>suggesting to students that they will be<br>armed for of unknown future by<br>reproducing the knowledge of the past<br>will not be sufficient to address the<br>challenges we are facing given the free<br>access we have to knowledge these days<br>thanks to the internet would it be more<br>productive to conceptualize knowledge as<br>a verb in our preparation for the future<br>what if we prepared students to create<br>use new knowledge to work with knowledge<br>and to develop knowledge in creative and<br>inventive ways the ways that knowledge<br>will need to be harnessed to solve the<br>wicked problems that we are<br>facing of course part of this you'll<br>need it for the future discourse is<br>about work you'll need these skills to<br>get a job to be a responsible productive<br>member of society so which skills will<br>you need a number of researchers future<br>forecasters business people have been<br>thinking about<br>this last year the ministry of business<br>Innovation and employment M commissioned<br>survey research with employers on the<br>future of work I want to focus on the<br>core skills section and I appreciate<br>that's difficult to read so I'm just<br>going to highlight the top five clusters<br>of skills that New Zealand businesses<br>are prioritizing as they res skill and<br>upskill their Workforce<br>number one leadership and social<br>influence analytical thinking problem<br>solving and Innovation emotional<br>intelligence Active Learning and<br>teaching strategies coordination and<br>time management at number 18 in the list<br>we have what I'll shortly refer to as<br>traditional reading and writing keep<br>this in mind as we carry<br>on according in to advice for chief<br>executive officers on how to prepare for<br>the future from Hayes traditional forms<br>of Education are failing to keep Pace<br>with the skills needed this suggests<br>that the status quo is not going to<br>future the United Nations educational<br>scientific and cultural organization<br>UNESCO has been working on Futures<br>literacy explaining skills to develop<br>today are unlikely to align with those<br>demanded by the jobs of tomorrow and<br>many will become<br>obsolete we know that artificial<br>intelligence will take over some jobs<br>and perhaps create some new<br>ones so we must ask<br>ourselves will a literacy curriculum<br>focusing on the basics prepare today's<br>students for the challenges of<br>tomorrow what should literacy education<br>for the future entail what should be the<br>role of Education in a world infused<br>with uncertainty and<br>complexity I agree that education has a<br>role to play in preparing young people<br>for the workplace in my view that is but<br>one aspect of Education I view education<br>as a public good as a society we invest<br>in education with the optimistic Vision<br>that ultimately the interest from that<br>investment will benefit everyone not<br>individual my colleague Jane Tilson and<br>I have been doing a bit of work in this<br>space thinking about how teachers and<br>students can stretch what counts as<br>literacy keeping in mind that what we do<br>future at its heart literacy is about<br>communication and meaning making I think<br>literacy is broader than reading and<br>writing<br>alone so I'm talking about supporting<br>students to develop an array of<br>practices and don't worry we're going to<br>on we have approached a broader vision<br>of literacy before in 2007 I was a<br>member of the task force examining the<br>synergies between weight e-learning and<br>literacy sounds so very long ago in that<br>work we highlighted the need to attend<br>to multiliteracies thinking broadly<br>about what C's literacy and how to<br>support students to develop the<br>literacies they need in all aspects of<br>their lives and those ideas are are<br>captured in this<br>graphic and it still holds true today<br>we're still facing the same challenges<br>on a global scale changes in the<br>knowledge economy globalization<br>increasing diversity and so forth we<br>still need to prepare students not only<br>for the classroom but the bridge into<br>all the different aspects of their lives<br>and all the different ways that they<br>meaning and we also came closer to a<br>stretched version of literacy in the<br>refreshed learning English learning area<br>and the common practice model that were<br>released last year I was honored as Viv<br>mentioned to be nominated by the New<br>Zealand literacy Association and to be<br>in the room with a diverse group of<br>principles teachers researchers<br>including tangena and Pacifica experts<br>to develop the English curriculum the<br>research that Jane and I have<br>contributed on critical literacy and<br>critical multiliteracies directly<br>informed the development of the common<br>practice model the pedagogies or methods<br>to teach literacy I was very positive<br>about the<br>2023 English learning area draft in PM I<br>thought it was picking up on where the<br>multiliteracies group had left off and<br>curriculum<br>however this work has disappeared to be<br>cabus so earlier I referred to<br>traditional literacy I want to be clear<br>I'm not invoking a new binary my case is<br>about expanding or stretching literacy<br>in order to future facing this version<br>of literacy includes what Mary colis and<br>Basics if you've been following the<br>education news like many of us do<br>probably too closely uh you will know<br>that the minister for Education<br>appointed a ministerial Advisory Group<br>the mag to review the English and maths<br>curriculum at the end of 2023 their<br>report and subsequent work resulted in a<br>refresh of the refresh that is now out<br>for consultation let me be clear I was<br>not involved in that<br>work so I'm not breaching any<br>non-disclosure agreements everything I<br>have been sharing is in the public<br>domain the draft English learning area<br>years 0 to six is currently out for<br>consultation and this is how they Define<br>literacy so perhaps we should be<br>augmenting what counts as literacy with<br>what colis and cope refer to as the new<br>Basics multiple literacies for<br>multimodal communication people who can<br>innovate take risks negotiate diversity<br>navigate uncertainty and use and create<br>a wide range of texts we've seen these<br>elements before in our discussion about<br>work and back to UNESCO in their work on<br>Futures literacy they argue for a<br>literacy and I just just want to draw<br>your attention to storytelling and the<br>Arts missing from the draft curriculum's<br>literacy I promised you we'd come back<br>to the vocab work we use explicit acts<br>of teaching to support students to break<br>the code and make meaning with<br>particular modes of meaning typically<br>we' focused on oral and written language<br>as in the old Basics but the other most<br>are also important for literacy and<br>communication when I talk about<br>curriculum literacies I'm talking about<br>how different learning areas privilege<br>the different modes for instance<br>gestural spatial and visual modes in<br>drama as sophisticated communicators and<br>meaning makers we make use of all of<br>combinations an important aspect of<br>expanding what counts as literacy is<br>working with a range of texts what do I<br>mean by the term text I use the term<br>surprise surprise in the broadest sense<br>a text can be constructed using multiple<br>modes of meaning oral language or<br>written language as well as audio<br>gestural spatial or visual modes the<br>term text has a Latin faka papa for my<br>grammar Geeks um coming from the term<br>texus meaning tissue and texed meaning<br>weave so the term text captures the<br>notion of weave leaving a tissue of<br>meaning let's take a look at a rich<br>text in this archival F photo from the<br>Alexander turull library we see the<br>kofifi or the rafter patterns the tukutu<br>the woven Lattis panels including the<br>ancestor toy and popo the wooden carved<br>slabs inside Fida meeting house at fanga<br>near gizon we see spatial Visual and<br>gestural modes here<br>contributing meaning for the reader to<br>meaning we're going to take a break for<br>a moment I want you to just take a<br>moment to reflect on your own literacy<br>practices so far today which literacy<br>practices have you used what was the<br>purpose which modes did you use which<br>texts did you work with did you read the<br>newspaper did you watch a video tutorial<br>on how to fix something did you listen<br>to music did you take photos and send<br>them to the family messenger chat did<br>you go on Instagram or Tik<br>okay<br>thank you why shout over the students<br>when you can just quietly raise your<br>hand uh it's fascinating when you use<br>that signal in in a um Auditorium full<br>of initial teacher education students<br>and the first years go what is she doing<br>someone says sh so what's my point you<br>probably used multimodal texts to<br>a vital aspect of future facing literacy<br>is critical literacy let's take a moment<br>to read the visual I selected for this<br>slide what does her body language tell<br>out how do you<br>think at its heart critical literacy<br>involves a critical stance towards texts<br>the text constructed by others and the<br>texts we construct ourselves remember<br>our broad definition of text critical<br>literacy involves understanding that<br>texts are rarely neutral the term<br>neutral invokes images of beige Bland or<br>inoffensive texts some might even say<br>anti-woke but if we understand texts as<br>typically constructed by someone to<br>convey something we know that the<br>author's worldview is woven into the<br>fabric of that text when teaching about<br>critical literacy I often set a homework<br>task that asks students to bring in a<br>neutral text for analysis they find it<br>very difficult and we have really rich<br>discussions authors construct texts for<br>many different purposes according to the<br>author George Orwell the purpose could<br>be encompassed by sheer egoism aesthetic<br>enthusiasm historical impulse or<br>political<br>purpose authors construct texts at<br>particular cultural historical political<br>and social moments some texts that may<br>have been somewhat acceptable at<br>particular moments in time can be<br>critically analyzed and<br>reconstructed so rather than focus on<br>the author's motivations which we cannot<br>always know we can focus on the text's<br>powers or effects so importantly we<br>so the purpose of critical literacy is<br>agency it's about developing the skills<br>and equipping students to affirm or<br>critical literacy is about power<br>critical literacy involves interrogating<br>texts when working with teachers they<br>often worry I think about the critical<br>literacy work work that it means that<br>students are going to have to March<br>through Main Street but taking action<br>operates on a Continuum from changing<br>Street when I present or teach about<br>critical literacy I often run into the<br>misconception that students can't engage<br>with this practice until they're fluent<br>readers after the completion of the<br>critical multiliteracies project Jane<br>and I created a resource for teachers<br>and we're about to watch an excerpt of a<br>critical literacy lesson with a year one<br>two so these students are ages five and<br>six group the teacher used a newspaper<br>article about a local event a fire on<br>Saddle Hill near East Ty to initiate the<br>unit to think about being text analysts<br>so we're going to dig a little bit<br>deeper okay we've got the facts now but<br>we need to think about the author and<br>what the author was wanting us to think<br>about<br>so we know who the article's written for<br>what do they want you to think<br>about why would the author write this<br>what do they want you to think about how<br>do they want you to feel when you read<br>it yeah the fire so they want you to<br>think about the fire so they want you to<br>know<br>people so when we're reading those<br>stories in our journals those factual<br>ones those articles they're non-fiction<br>aren't they why do we read the<br>non-fiction stories do we read them to<br>laugh and be entertained what are they<br>for why do we I'm learning stuff that<br>are true things okay because then you<br>can get better at knowing stuff that are<br>real okay so we're learning about real<br>things real facts aren't we<br>okay I want you to think about now<br>what things does the author not talk<br>about what important stuff would you<br>have wanted to know that wasn't in the<br>article animals animals animal animals<br>yeah and they couldn't get away because<br>they were chained up and they and they<br>were running around I'm going to<br>underline animals cuz I feel like this<br>is an important one to you guys so cows<br>sheep deer dogs pets so some were<br>injured and some actually died didn't<br>they which was really sad and the author<br>doesn't mention that at all not even<br>once from the heat yes put a we arrow<br>down here not even a word not even just<br>animals no doesn't say anything it<br>doesn't even say animals in it so yeah<br>is there anything else that the author<br>doesn't really talk about or doesn't<br>really go into any detail about that you<br>would want to know it's it<br>does of there was heaps of Ash there was<br>cuz actually even though the fire didn't<br>get to everyone's house some people have<br>still got a massive amount of cleaning<br>up to do from all the ash that got and<br>smoke damage that got into their houses<br>what else didn't what you think about<br>the people in the story what else did<br>the author not tell us do we know what<br>happened to those firefighters do we<br>know if they're okay did it tell us no<br>didn't it tell us tell what they went to<br>it didn't we don't know if they were<br>really badly injured and they were flown<br>to another hospital we don't know if it<br>was just a little<br>injury ambulance or<br>a a helicopter we don't know that but<br>that's all it sees isn't it I wonder why<br>they didn't tell us<br>anymore what do you think maybe it's<br>because um they were the sad story like<br>possibly toed that that um the the<br>hospital people couldn't do anything<br>about it possibly maybe and maybe maybe<br>the family didn't want all the public to<br>know what happened there's lots of<br>reasons why it might want to be so sad<br>since they actually have to ask for<br>family they probably do cuz it's a very<br>private thing when somebody in your<br>family gets injured or goes to hospital<br>you might not want everyone to know<br>about it what might not want everyone to<br>know that they're really really sad so<br>we just saw Haley skillfully scaffold<br>her students from the known what did the<br>author want you to know about to the<br>critical literacy question what was<br>missing and they had a lot to say they<br>also engage in some deeply ethical work<br>considering the article from the<br>family's point of view this work cannot<br>be scripted because there is no right<br>answer it involves teachers and students<br>critically interrogating texts together<br>their critical multiliteracies unit<br>culminated with creating a class<br>newscast to speak back to what was<br>missing my take-home message students do<br>not need to be fluent readers to develop<br>their text analyst skills this is a<br>vital literacy practice for a lifetime<br>young people deserve to start learning<br>away in an age of Miss dis and Mal<br>information critical literacy practices<br>are more important than<br>ever it's probably not surprising that<br>work in critical literacy led me to<br>misinformation or fake news I first met<br>Steven Davis at the launch of his book<br>when I asked him to sign it I said I did<br>research on critical literacy and we<br>needed to talk we did two projects<br>together an online survey with 140<br>teachers and 446 secondary students and<br>a university of aago research Grant<br>funded study working with teachers<br>Librarians and their students I'm going<br>to just highlight a couple of those<br>findings for you this evening in the<br>student focus group interviews we asked<br>them where we could integrate teaching<br>and learning using a critical literacy<br>approach to misinformation the teachers<br>had integrated across a variety of<br>learning areas and the students agreed<br>that it could go right across all the<br>different learning areas wherever you<br>were using surprise surprise<br>information um they also wanted all<br>students to engage in teaching and<br>learning around<br>misinformation and revisit it regularly<br>not just a one-off unit for the new the<br>year new the New Year nines to engage<br>with every time you did a research<br>project we should have a refresher and<br>every year we should do it with more<br>complex content it needed to be a<br>regular practice and then we said well<br>how old should you be to engage with<br>this work and some of the students<br>stents thought intermediate because<br>that's when many of them got their<br>smartphones and so that's when you<br>should start doing the teaching and<br>learning around it and others said no no<br>it needs to start before then before<br>they're on social media before they've<br>phones a common critical literacy<br>question is to ask what's missing in a<br>text as we just saw in Haley's video I<br>argue that sometimes what's been left<br>out can speak more loudly than what's<br>been included returning to the draft<br>English learning area currently out for<br>uh consultation let's take our critical<br>literacy lens to<br>it are you<br>ready I could draw out a number of<br>points but it'll be time for a coup soon<br>so I'll just make two points this<br>evening according to a recently<br>published NZ blog on mauy perspectives<br>of<br>literacy uh the authors Jane fernus Moi<br>Rua Bridget Masters<br>Gemma piery Cameron and Bill Cochran<br>argue that Mai literacy perspectives<br>align with a multi- literacy view of<br>literacy while they're addressing adult<br>literacy policy I think their work<br>applies here remember unesco's call to<br>include storytelling and the<br>Arts it's not clear how the draft<br>English learning area is a taking<br>account of their advice for policy<br>let's take our skeptical stance to this<br>text again another important aspect of<br>critical literacy is multiple readings<br>the cognitive scientist guy kleon who's<br>been based at Oxford and other UK<br>universities recently articulated a<br>range of concerns around using the<br>science of learning I'll share a few of<br>his key points that are germine to my<br>case this evening firstly there is no<br>single agreed science of learning the<br>learning Sciences plural are informed by<br>a wide range of disciplines including<br>experimental psychology social and<br>affective Neuroscience cognitive<br>anthropology developmental psychology<br>robotics AI neurology systems theory<br>sociocultural studies embodied cognition<br>and school-based<br>research multiple avenues for evidence<br>and information processing is on its way<br>out as a field of academic study Claxton<br>writes this subfield of cognitive<br>science drawing on this root metaphor of<br>the Mind as a computer is flawed and<br>misleading because it takes no account<br>of the neurodynamic attitudinal social<br>emotional embodied and cultural factors<br>that play a major if often unvisible and<br>unsung role in every moment in every<br>classroom I could elaborate more but I<br>want to draw your attention to something<br>else that's<br>missing<br>citations in Academia we place trust in<br>an argument based on its evidence yet<br>the draft curriculum provides two<br>citations one from 2002 and one from<br>2005 I don't know so many academics that<br>can get published with such a brief and<br>outdated reference list teachers need to<br>see the evidence to critically engage<br>with it and debate its merits for their<br>students and for themselves we can't<br>value so back to my case I said I'd make<br>a case for future facing literacies and<br>I hope you come away with thinking that<br>literacy is pretty complicated business<br>and the future is unknown we need a way<br>of thinking about literacy that<br>approximates its complexity this word<br>cloud captures some of the key ideas<br>we've been exploring I've argued that in<br>order to face the future we need to view<br>literacy as a multimodal embodied<br>situated repertoire of social practices<br>in the words of Paulo frie we need to be<br>world so where do we go from here we<br>need critically literate o teachers Foo<br>families and AKA students who are<br>prepared to discuss debate and<br>critically interrogate curriculum<br>pedagogy and texts we need folks who<br>will step up and step back who will<br>listen and who will ask are we preparing<br>our students to be agentic and Savvy<br>texts I encourage you to have a look<br>don't take my word for it<br>consultation closes on the 20th of<br>September only 25 days in total to<br>engage and respond teachers are expected<br>to implement the new curriculum in term<br>1<br>now few take-home messages literacy is<br>varied and complex the future of work<br>demands literacy that Embraces<br>complexity critique and diversity and<br>literacy must be stretched to be future<br>facing this is the version of literacy<br>that we want for<br>Freddy the traditional practices of<br>reading and writing alone are<br>insufficient to ensure successful<br>communication and meaning making to meet<br>the demands of an unknown future I rest<br>my<br>case<br>no I<br>with your food basket and my food basket<br>the people will Thrive this fatoki<br>speaks of community of collaboration and<br>a strength based approach it<br>acknowledges that everyone has something<br>to offer and by working together we can<br>all flourish it was not possible to<br>include all of my work and all of my<br>amazing co-researchers and co-authors in<br>tonight's presentation but I just want<br>to reiterate I did not do this work on<br>my own I would not be here tonight<br>without about the generous support of<br>colleagues teachers and students who<br>embarked on this journey with me nautu<br>taku<br>keep<br>all take<br>not he<br>keep their<br>time Campbell tooa I'm the proce<br>chancellor of<br>humanities uh greetings everyone uh I<br>get to speak last on behalf of the<br>university and of the<br>professorate I'm delighted to offer this<br>brief response to Professor sandr's<br>lecture an inaugural professorial<br>lecture can go in a lot of directions it<br>can be in an affecting life story of one<br>person's academic Journey it could be a<br>celebration of a community of academic<br>family and wider people who have played<br>a vital role on that Journey it can be a<br>moment of insight into the kinds of<br>excellent new academic knowledge being<br>generated at our<br>University sometimes it's even an<br>elegant and well articulated critique of<br>current political moments and<br>crisis it's rare however for one IPL to<br>be able to fulfill all these<br>expectations at<br>once tonight is one of those rare<br>exceptions and so as both Pro Vice<br>Chancellor and as a professor at the<br>University I offer my heartiest<br>congratulations to professor sreo she<br>has more than demonstrated why she was<br>invited to join the ranks of the<br>professorate at the<br>University tonight's talk however is<br>happening at a particular moment<br>academically institutionally and<br>nationally and I want to very briefly<br>reflect on her work in light of those<br>three areas first academic<br>Professor sandr's lecture was has taken<br>us into some of the key issues in the<br>disciplinary study of Education the<br>question of language learning is core to<br>how we understand education and also to<br>how we professionally train generations<br>of<br>teachers I've learned a great deal from<br>her talk I've learned that understanding<br>knowledge as a verb not a noun is<br>fundamental to how we might move forward<br>to prepare students who can work with<br>knowledge and potentially help solve<br>huge societal and environmental problems<br>I've learned that we need to understand<br>classroom processes as more than just<br>equipping individuals for jobs with the<br>basics but as a pathway to benefiting<br>all of society in a world infused with<br>uncertainty and complexity and I<br>listened with interest about the<br>powerful work of Scholars and<br>communities of action to develop a whole<br>new curriculum a whole new learning<br>process um that was designed<br>specifically to meet these critical<br>goals and it's just a Pity about what's<br>happened since<br>Professor sandretto has demonstrated<br>tonight why deeply considered<br>scholarship and the development of<br>complex ideas and relationships are so<br>important in understanding how teaching<br>might Poss positively shape The Wider<br>World second<br>institutionally Professor sandero has<br>reminded us that our professional<br>programs are sites of both excellent<br>applied professional teaching and<br>learning but also that they ground these<br>activities upon deeply considered and<br>important insight ites from the academic<br>study of Education we've seen tonight<br>how our College of Education continues<br>to be a place that does some of the most<br>vital Mahi we do as a university I<br>acknowledge that work I acknowledge it<br>in Professor sano's work and I<br>acknowledge the work of all your<br>professional Community who have turned<br>out to support you tonight thank you for<br>what you do as Scholars and Educators<br>you help position this University as a<br>Force for good in the<br>world finally finally the<br>political the work of universities is to<br>act as the con the role of universities<br>is to act as the conscience and critic<br>of Society tonight we've seen why it is<br>so vital that our bravest academics do<br>exactly this we've seen that political<br>and policy decisions will go better if<br>our best Scholars are Partners in their<br>development and on behalf of the<br>university in the professorate I urge<br>you to keep doing exactly this for our<br>future we need everyone to keep doing<br>exactly<br>this in my part of the scholarly world<br>we talk of the two Pathways towards<br>sustainability one is the straight line<br>that runs through considered thoughtful<br>adaptive management the other is what we<br>call the back Loop to<br>sustainability where progress occurs<br>through crisis setbacks and long<br>detours in the area of curriculum and<br>language learning we definitely to be<br>appear to be at a bit of a back Loop<br>towards a better future at the moment so<br>I Ur you all urge you all to remember<br>what Professor sandrea has told us<br>tonight and always keep our eyes on the<br>important future destinations we're<br>heading towards no matter how rocky the<br>immediate Road looks directly in front<br>of us so thank you Susan you're are a<br>role model for a 21st century academic<br>an inspiration for your colleagues and a<br>true friend and supporter to your many<br>communities of action please join me and<br>once again congratulating Professor</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
