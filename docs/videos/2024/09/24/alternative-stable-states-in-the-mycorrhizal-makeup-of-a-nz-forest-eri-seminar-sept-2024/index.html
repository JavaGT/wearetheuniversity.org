We hypothesized that, within certain environmental parameters, Nothofagus stands in New Zealand sometimes act as an analogue of monodominant tropical stands, forming a stable alternative to more species-rich conifer-broadleaf forests, with both phases stabilized by positive feedbacks. Suppression of nitrogen mineralization by ectomycorrhizal fungi may limit invasion of Nothofagus stands by arbuscular mycorrhizal species, which are largely dependent on mineral nitrogen. In contrast, the high light requirements of Nothofagus seedlings may prevent them invading the more deeply shaded understories of neighbouring conifer-broadleaf stands. We tested these hypotheses in a mosaic of Nothofagus and conifer-broadleaf stands, by planting seedlings of six tree species across a wide range of light environments in both forest types, and by measuring mineral nutrient availability. Our first hypothesis was well supported. Depending on season, average nitrate levels were 16–20 times higher beneath conifer-broadleaf stands than beneath Nothofagus. When light levels were held constant, three of five species from the conifer-broadleaf forest grew more slowly in Nothofagus stands than in conifer-broadleaf stands, whereas Nothofagus growth rates did not differ between the two forest types. Support for our second hypothesis was less conclusive: the whole-plant light compensation point of Nothofagus seedlings was the highest of the six species, but was nevertheless below the average light levels in conifer-broadleaf stand understories. Results suggest ectomycorrhizal suppression of nitrogen mineralization is responsible for perpetuating Nothofagus dominance, but shed less light on the local failure of Nothofagus to invade conifer-broadleaf stands. <br><br>Biography: Chris Lusk is a forest ecologist who has worked in Chile, Australia and New Zealand.

Chris FL um he<br>is a uh Forest ecologist and a<br>associate associate professor on here at<br>the<br>University be talking about um<br>alternative stable States in<br>New<br>Forest<br>everybody today I'm going to tell you<br>about an experiment that makes up one of<br>four strands in my Martin project that's<br>just<br>coming looks at at landscape partition<br>between different micro risal<br>associations in the South temperate zone<br>uh and that that's really North fagus<br>versus the rest because at least in<br>Chile and New Zealand Nora fagus is a is<br>an Ecto micro Rizal outlier in loner in<br>tree Flo that are dominated almost<br>completely<br>by I'm going to start this story by<br>taking you briefly away from the south<br>we<br>are<br>so tropical moist Forest are of course a<br>i word for<br>diversity as you can see quite well here<br>in this<br>photo you can easily find 1503 species<br>per hectare in moist trop tropical moist<br>Forest so imagine imagine what a shock<br>you'd get if you suddenly you're walking<br>through a tropical forest and suddenly<br>you walk into a stand and one tree is<br>completely dominant because that's<br>happen here is a monodominant stand of<br>um this tree in the Walnut family in<br>in this species or mexic dominates all<br>tear of the for the the story<br>sub canopy and the canopy which suggests<br>that it's a stable compositionally<br>stable stand it's not an early<br>successional stand that's going to be<br>invaded by other species it seems to<br>have a pretty stable hold on on these<br>sites but another example from tropical<br>Africa this this is a true equator<br>rainforest right on the equator in Congo<br>and this is an even more overwhelming<br>example of monodominance I'm not even<br>going to try and pronounce that name but<br>but it's in the P family<br>and from the seedlings right up to to<br>the forest canopy the species is<br>overwhelmingly<br>dominant so monodominant is is commonly<br>it's kind of a convention<br>to rule of thumb that greater than 60%<br>dominance well that dominance that but<br>that last example we just saw is much<br>higher than 60% more like<br>% and most of these tropical<br>monodominant stands appear stable not<br>all of them but most of them appear<br>stable and the boundaries are not easily<br>explained by topography or soil type so<br>if this white patch here represent a<br>monodominant stand here it's not like<br>the soil is it's different under here<br>from or inherently different from over<br>here it's not like these are on ridges<br>topographically<br>differentiated so we seem to be dealing<br>with alternative stable states with<br>these monoton<br>stands what's going on here this has<br>been this is first noted I think in the<br>90s people started commenting on this<br>and there's been several theories about<br>what's going on it's driving these these<br>monodominant<br>stands well what these two trees that<br>I've just shown you have in common is<br>that they're both<br>ector now this is true of this turns out<br>to be true most but not all of the trees<br>that form these monodominant<br>forests so why is this important I have<br>to do some uh brief refresh here I think<br>about micro risal associations I'll only<br>talk about two types here the two most<br>widespread types most terrestrial plant<br>species that fig is probably a bit too<br>high but most<br>formulars with those fungal groups and<br>then includes most tropical moist forest<br>trees the main benefit of our vascular<br>micro rism infection seems to be<br>enhanced access to to greatly increases<br>the absorptive surface of the plant<br>so there's enhanced uptake of of<br>nutrients mineral nutrients like<br>phosphate that don't diffuse very far in<br>the<br>soil the other well-known type is is<br>Ecto micro<br>risers these These are common in North<br>temperate zone and in the Boreal forest<br>most trees are e to mic risal different<br>fungal<br>groups from icular micro risers and uh<br>there there's a small minority of<br>e now some EXA micral<br>fungi they have a superpower that I'm<br>I'm going to some of you may know about<br>but I'm about to<br>to explain they<br>can Short Circuit the local nitrogen<br>cycle in a way<br>that gives their host trees privileged<br>access to nitrogen at the expense of<br>everybody<br>else here is a couple of um slides<br>contrasting local nutrients local<br>nitrogen cycling in our vascular versus<br>Ecto micral vitation so what you can see<br>here is is what you'll see in most<br>textbooks before well until very<br>recently as normal local ntion Cy right<br>so you've got the<br>um<br>decomposers breaking down the organic<br>matter and that decomposition process<br>eventually results in the liberation of<br>ammonium and nitrate soil solution so<br>you've got mineralization there and that<br>mineral nitrogen is taken up by tree<br>roots by our vascular<br>mic so the the decomposers and the<br>vascular micral fungi are doing quite<br>different things quite different things<br>things get a bit blurred in Ecto micro<br>risal vegetation where you can get an<br>organic nitrogen economy as it's been<br>some of these Ecto mical fungi they<br>retain part of the enzymatic repertoire<br>of their decomposer ancestors<br>so they can extract organic nitrogen<br>from dead organic matter cutting out the<br>middle man so to speak that's theosis so<br>um I've attempted to attach some some<br>eicr razal hyp there that are going into<br>that de organic matter<br>and preempting the decomposers or at<br>least competing with the<br>decomposers so um<br>this well funny enough the decomposers<br>are not Terribly Happy about this<br>they've got competition for nitrogen<br>they have to deal with a a substrate<br>that's been impoverished in nitrogen and<br>so decomposition slows down and you get<br>less<br>mineralization so this is how this short<br>circuit<br>works and you get a you can get at least<br>some circumstances a positive feedback<br>set up that perpetuates Ecto arisal<br>dominance on the site<br>um abundant Ecto micro risal trees<br>abundant fungi and symbiosis with them<br>fungi compete with the decomposers for<br>nitrogen which slows down decomposition<br>and mineralization so our vascular micis<br>plants that that um don't have this<br>privileged access to<br>nitrogen can be starved nit the supply<br>of nitr is greatly reduced so their<br>survival is reduced so most<br>opportunities are captured by by um<br>seedlings of<br>eicr that's the positive feedback that's<br>been demonstrated um uh pretty<br>comprehensively in this tropical forest<br>with um the Oro mon Mexican the all no<br>family<br>tree so it's quite likely that nor fagus<br>which is also M RIS is doing this sort<br>of thing in New Zealand sometimes if you<br>go into a beach Forest like this one you<br>can see now the under story is is um<br>quite sparse Forest is quite that's not<br>just the deer the<br>deer the P hero speak but but the end<br>story is is the forest is quite open uh<br>it's quite a simple structure and<br>there's just a a kind of narrow range of<br>understory<br>so briefly I'll talk about noras<br>distribution New Zealand and how<br>Landscapes are partition between norus<br>and and uh other tree species so norus<br>of course is as as some of you at least<br>will know it's mainly in colder parts of<br>the country at most abundant down south<br>and P<br>elevations in the Lan North Island it's<br>interesting pattern that it's uh there a<br>topographic often a topographic<br>segregation so uh it's often on ridges<br>and Spurs I've got a slide here to this<br>is a satellite photo of Hill Country in<br>theang wui area and these dark smudges<br>that you can see here these dark streaks<br>that's those are North Fus candra stands<br>black Beach stands on Spurs and ridges<br>and the brighter green is Conor for<br>broadleaf Forest which is occupying most<br>of faces most of the Val so there's a<br>there's a topographic sorting or<br>segregation<br>here but even though there is this<br>definitely sorting and segregation<br>across Landscapes at different scales<br>there's a lot of overlap between the<br>environmental tolerances of North veg<br>species and and uh our vascular micro<br>risal<br>trees and um so you can get you can get<br>situations where of course where where<br>you get mixtures<br>and what's more you can get in some<br>places these occasionally these<br>monodominant norus stands within a<br>mosaic of more diversifi anybody been is<br>Corner been there so it's um I'd seen a<br>paper about this stand and and um it's<br>fascinating read and and I was walking<br>across this huge clearing and I looked<br>up and oh there it is you can just see<br>the pattern quite quite obviously there<br>as should approach the these dark<br>patches here are monodominant not candry<br>stands they're almost p candry in a<br>matrix of more diverse of a broadly<br>Forest the the biggest trees<br>are<br>liadis Kaka and pine<br>5 this looks kind of um eily<br>familiar we think of that tropical<br>example of Po dominance here's another<br>parent example which I've been I've me<br>this is where the experiment I'm going<br>to show you was done in the Eastern wi<br>and upper so this is a this is actually<br>a covenant in Forest on private<br>land and it's mostly kind of a broadly<br>Forest but there<br>are these nor fagus stands here these<br>darker patches once again which are nor<br>fagus<br>stands now at this site there is a<br>degree of of sorting so the norus tends<br>to be on poorer soils than the con ofly<br>stand but is over there so um here are<br>some I went around and and drove lot of<br>holes in the ground sent lot of s the<br>samples off to the Laboratories to try<br>and find stands that were on of North<br>Vegas and con BR on very similar soils<br>and eventually<br>after after spending quite a lot of<br>money I eventually found found these<br>stands so um uh this there's actually a<br>lot of overlap in in in total nitrogen<br>you look on here on this left hand graph<br>so there's um it's pretty easy to find<br>stands that have that have uh same nitr<br>concentration not quite so easy with<br>phosphorus um but you can compare stands<br>that are very similar in terms of total<br>phosphorus<br>so I found these three Beach stands here<br>identified those three Beach stands and<br>and<br>three cont Le stands<br>with very similar total soil phosphorus<br>and nitrogen and simil toogy they're all<br>on North facing slopes or ridges um I<br>should just mention that these two um<br>these two fine texture patches car<br>stands post fire stands that kind of a<br>third element in the landscape here<br>stands it been burnt<br>perhaps 50 years<br>ago so we use these six stands for our<br>exper<br>so quick look at these two Forest types<br>the the kind of a broadly Forest at<br>Rocky Hill is um it's very different<br>from what you're used to seeing around<br>here in the wo District it's it's cooler<br>and it's dryer and um it's also I think<br>the composition has also probably been<br>altered<br>by by logging and fire to some extent<br>but this these stand as you can see here<br>haven't certainly haven't been loged or<br>burnt for at least 150 years maybe 200<br>years and<br>um uh heno is a dominant canopy tree<br>which is pretty<br>unusual uh pigeonwood is also very<br>common a lot of silver<br>Fern po carps are actually quite scarce<br>they're scattered at low<br>densities that might reflect history but<br>the beach Forest is as you can see is<br>looks very different<br>uh over 90% of the basil area is nor F<br>candra the under story is is more<br>diverse but very interestingly you've<br>got as well as the nor fagas samplings<br>that are indicative of of S replacement<br>in situ there there is a lot of Eric<br>casy in the industry now the Eric is<br>there are another group of plants that<br>have a a third type of Micro Riser the<br>ericoid micro risers that<br>also give access to organic nitrogen<br>they have they can do a similar trick to<br>the exic fun so they're quite at home in<br>this they can they can prosper in this<br>environment in a way that most our<br>vascular microbiz plants can't can you<br>see a tree bur in in the state here<br>there's almost no Tree f in the beach<br>for now there's there's um an obvious<br>difference<br>in in the structure these Forest is the<br>canopy structure the canopy is is um<br>much leafier and denser in the coner<br>Broad Leaf stands so the underst stories<br>are much darker there's only about half<br>as much light stories on average as in<br>the beach and this is something you can<br>see when you go trans and I know I've<br>heard people say people who are kind<br>of don't normally don't study forest for<br>example say oh Beach Forest is so bright<br>and and I feel more cheerful cheerful<br>Beach Forest because there's more<br>light and that's because of differences<br>in leaf areer index it's at least one<br>unit of difference there so this is the<br>average numbers average number of leaves<br>that a imaginary beam would have to pass<br>so we hypothesized that we have um<br>positive feedback stabilizing both these<br>familiar on the left there in the beach<br>Forest we've got that same kind of H<br>same kind of organic nitrogen economy<br>that we that we saw in that tropical<br>monodon forest and the beach Forest what<br>we're thinking is that um the end story<br>is simply too dark sorry the story is<br>simply too dark for Beach SE because<br>the fosas spora group norus species are<br>probably the most light demanding tall<br>trees in the country and this this is<br>by low light survival data that have<br>been<br>published by the land care people<br>they've um supported that support the<br>impression these beaches are the most<br>light demanding trees new<br>Ze late successional tree Flora so uh<br>yeah just beaches just shut out by lack<br>of life so we we set out to test both<br>hypotheses um<br>so yeah this is this is here I'm showing<br>how I think shade keeps n Fus at kind of<br>a broadly stance so we would expect then<br>the beach species to have a higher light<br>compensation point of growth than any of<br>the species from the con Forest so this<br>is light availability here on a log<br>scale and here above ground relative<br>growth<br>rate so the compensation point is where<br>net growth is zero so it should be<br>higher in Beach than in any of the<br>species from<br>the and if we've got an organic nitrogen<br>economy hurting the um the vascular<br>micro risal species in in Beach stands<br>and we should have something like this<br>going that the the growth of the am<br>species that's the Bradly species should<br>be depressed right across all light<br>environments because they're just<br>struggling to get enough nitrogen so<br>they're probably have to allocate more<br>whereas Beach should be kind of<br>indifferent it shouldn't really mind<br>which Forest type it's<br>growing we grew five species from the<br>con broadly Forest um some of these were<br>good choices and some of them weren't<br>quite so<br>good so four of these are a vascular<br>micro risal the one in the<br>middle is it's like most protac it's<br>non and that means then like the<br>arbuscular micro species it should not<br>have access to organic<br>M so it should behave much like we<br>expected to behave like thetic<br>species so let's see the beach seedlings<br>there they are black Beach seedlings<br>planted now as some of you may know you<br>can't grow you can't just go and plant<br>seedlings in the forest in New Zealand<br>and and expect them to be still there<br>when you come back your quarterly visits<br>unless you protect them from the<br>introduced managerie so um this is a<br>technology this is of call this a<br>technology we've used before on my<br>previous margin and it works well whack<br>in these um these 2.4 meter high poost<br>whack them and then WRA this<br>tough thoughts Pig proof<br>um polypropylene mesh around these and<br>you but that's not enough you got to put<br>pest bikes around the top to keep posy<br>out because if POS can get anywhere near<br>your experiment they will<br>mess and this this works<br>well this set up works well was it only<br>failed once we had a a pig busted its<br>way into one of these plots wasn't clear<br>why because it once it got in it didn't<br>seem to do much but it it determined<br>made a determined if it forced its way<br>under mes here snap the cable ties<br>fly um and then it sort of just sort of<br>du the ground bit and then just<br>disappeared Unfortunately they let POS<br>the<br>top we lost we lost some data point<br>there so we measured we use this<br>wonderful instrument the uh the like<br>plant canopy analyzer to to measure<br>light environments above each seedling<br>this is this is a um terrific<br>instrument that gives you high quality<br>data<br>so just showing you roughly the<br>distribution of the plots we we cited<br>the plots now these are not randomly<br>cited that wouldn't be much pointed that<br>they're cited to maximize the range of<br>light environments grow species across<br>the W so some beneath pre gaps some<br>beneath the darkest parts of the stance<br>some an intermediate environments<br>there's six plots in each of the beach<br>stands I Haven mentioned these now these<br>um Ian dicki my collaborator Ian dicki<br>suggested these and um uh we've got<br>mixed results with these but they seem<br>to have worked they seem to have given<br>us um very believable and very<br>conclusive data in this experiment these<br>um PL Ro simulat probes they have an<br>iron exchange membrane there that um um<br>absorbs ions from from the solil<br>solution one c one for anion and uh we<br>did two two rounds of Buri we buried in<br>the spring when thought that<br>mineralization might be limited by<br>temperature and in the Autumn when we<br>thought it might be limited by soil<br>moisture I'll show you those results I<br>think they're the first results actually<br>and um yeah they they the most<br>conclusive<br>results there is no nitrate under the<br>beach there is no nitrate under the<br>beach St<br>practically you don't you don't really<br>need<br>St unusual in ecology to get a result<br>that's conclusive<br>like yeah<br>um so pretty clear evidence that the<br>exomic risal Fung are crashing<br>mineralization L shi's listing is he is<br>you know he had something to say about<br>this as well might mention shortly um so<br>um ammonium now the ammonium pattern is<br>a bit different we found no<br>difference there's less ammonium than<br>nitrate but U no difference between the<br>two for types in either<br>season um the complete the almost<br>complete lack of nitrate means that<br>ammonium is the dominant form under the<br>beach<br>STS and um Lou Sher said that wondered<br>if there was either the trees or the<br>Fung also um inhibiting<br>nitrication interesting idea that we<br>might look<br>into so as well as short circuiting the<br>nitr cycle maybe there's some<br>nitrification inhibition going on no<br>effect on on<br>phosphate so<br>um it doesn't seem to be evidence of an<br>organic phosphorus it's really just a<br>nitrogen similar concentrations beneath<br>the two for types I'm going to show you<br>one more<br>iron might be a surprise that's um<br>manganese why am i showing you manganese<br>because<br>um ex micr Rizal fungies some of them at<br>least produce manganese peroxidase which<br>is one of the enzymes that's involved a<br>key enzyme involved in in breaking down<br>the organic matter and and getting<br>getting the nitrogen out so so sometimes<br>you find elevated concentrations of<br>Manganese ions under Ecto micro<br>vegetation and we we seem to have it<br>here particularly in the Autumn we've<br>got evidence<br>of quite a lot of manganese in Sol<br>solution so this is this is further<br>evidence of an organic ntion economy we<br>n<br>so that the the soil nutrient data now<br>I'm going to show you some some data on<br>how the seedlings responded to the<br>different growth environments and so<br>there's a graph showing the growth of<br>each species in relation to light okay<br>note that the light is shown on a log<br>scale because plant<br>growth doesn't respond linearly to light<br>log on an arithmetic scope so each each<br>point on the graphs is the mean of the<br>two plants on the plot in cases where<br>the two plants surviv because in a lot<br>like but some plants just died for<br>reasons unknown so that each point each<br>dot sometimes represents one plant<br>sometimes two but the two plants are on<br>the<br>same now that's a more ecological sort<br>of result I'm afraid to<br>say more eological result<br>so um yeah I'm not going I'm too<br>embarrassed to show you the ass we you<br>know um pretty close to round<br>now I've got a comment about the lines<br>on the graph what I'm showing you there<br>those lines are not ordinary Le s<br>regression major AIS now I'm showing you<br>major AIS because we're not interested<br>here so much in predicting y from X<br>we're interested in comparing the slope<br>and elevation of the two lines do that<br>you need major AIS which is it is the<br>first AIS of PCA that's exactly what it<br>is and so we're we're asking if in each<br>case if the species in question grows<br>slower in the beach forest and and if<br>there's an interaction there so if<br>there's an interaction the we um<br>difference is significant difference in<br>the<br>slope so I'll show you the stats he know<br>a well species that didn't behave well<br>this a species that it<br>didn't my impression is that perhaps<br>it's it's a not a great species for<br>transplanting that some individuals grew<br>well but but look at this plant down<br>here we gave it<br>everything it just it just sat there and<br>soed it's got like 7%<br>light um so some of them took off and<br>some of them just soled so but um we<br>don't really have a lot of statistical<br>power say to DET take different is there<br>but but we just can't we have no<br>evidence of of a difference between<br>two between the two for environments<br>which goes against the hes P water is a<br>better behaved species we do have a<br>difference in elevation um on average it<br>grows more slowly in the beach<br>Forest so that that's consistent<br>hypothesis it's anular risal species<br>yeah this is another poorly behaved<br>species um so we've got we've got a hint<br>of a almost significant difference in<br>slope<br>there what's going on there um as it's a<br>non-micro risal species we expected it<br>to grow slow Beach Forest but we we<br>don't have any evidence of<br>that doesn't supp hypothesis Lemonwood<br>now here at last is Lemonwood is a model<br>species um so it it was very unhappy in<br>the beach Forest as you can<br>see a big difference in the growth rate<br>types and look at look at the tight<br>grouping of the plants in of of the<br>points in the in the vascular micro<br>risal forest and the con Wy Forest great<br>species that transplants well I can I<br>can recommend it<br>torta another species that I can<br>recommend is a good one to work with um<br>so that's another nice ask word for at<br>least in the in the con Broadley Forest<br>we've got again a significant difference<br>in elevation which means that t grows<br>more slowly in the beach<br>Forest<br>hypothesis finally black Beach which is<br>another badly behaved species I'm afraid<br>it's um so um<br>it's problem here is we got we got<br>seedlings from two proven part of the<br>problem at least we got seedlings from<br>two providences we raised some ourself<br>and from Rocky Hill Road I bought some<br>from a nursery and the nursery seedings<br>weren't good they um some of them just<br>sort of so started dropping leaf with<br>the grounds we actually had to replace<br>some of them so the the beach data<br>are not great<br>anyway we've we again we've got a hint<br>of a difference in slow but it's not<br>quite significant and a hint of a<br>difference in<br>elevation I don't know why Beach would<br>be unhappier growing in the beach Forest<br>than in the conver Bley<br>Forest but we did notice that they got<br>more defoliated in the beach Forest that<br>there were um there was damage from<br>chewing insects on the seedlings in both<br>forests but Le miners uh were present on<br>almost every seedling in the beach<br>Forest so maybe there an effect there<br>natural enemies that they escape to some<br>extent if they're planted<br>coming now compensation Point<br>data here we're trying to find out if<br>Beach is the most light demanding tree<br>and if its compensation point is<br>basically too high for it to grow in the<br>stories now unfortunately these some of<br>these data are<br>well you can see the competence<br>intervals there's there only two species<br>that have sort of useful confidence<br>intervals lemon wood and torur right so<br>we can have some confidence in those<br>estimates of the compensations the<br>others because the the relationships<br>weak I don't think we can say much at<br>allation points and there are no<br>significant differences here ination<br>Point even if has got the highest<br>doesn't differ significantly from I<br>don't think from any of them and um<br>what's more um what's<br>more it's compensation point there<br>according to this is about 1% light<br>but it's the average understory light<br>environment in the con brly stands is<br>about 2%<br>so it's not clear why it's not<br>establishing in<br>evading so to sum up we have we do have<br>evidence quite good evidence to support<br>one of our hypothesis about feedback<br>mechanisms we've got evidence of that<br>that short circuiting of the NIT cycle<br>stabilizes nor fous dominance at Rocky<br>Hill so we've got nutrient availability<br>data showing an organic Nation economy<br>and we've got suppression of growth of<br>some but not all our vascular mical<br>species seedlings in the nor F<br>stands the other hypothesis um yeah<br>that's not not so well<br>supported we've got we do have evidence<br>that the conflict stands are much darker<br>than the beach stands but they're<br>possibly not too dark for nor Fus<br>seedings<br>and our compensation Point data are cly<br>incens I'm not sure what we're going to<br>it and that is<br>that so um acknowledgement of course to<br>the Royal Society of New Zealand and to<br>Ian<br>Dicky my main collaborator on this<br>project and Forest Enterprises are right<br>firm to work with they own this coveted<br>Forest it's a whole lot easier than<br>working on dockland as some of you will<br>know you had parallel experiences um and<br>Legion of helpers' helped various ways<br>in the field<br>or<br>seedlings being Field contact people<br>that kind of thing so yes thank you and<br>we' got a few a few minutes for<br>good question um these STS how are the<br>what's your hypothesis on how they get<br>St started um you think your priority<br>effects that they establish and then<br>these mechanisms keep them within that<br>stable State perpetuate the sort of pure<br>stand of Beach versus the mixed aard<br>Forest yeah presumably some kind of<br>disturbance event that flips that and<br>you get a disturbance event and then um<br>that coincides with a set of<br>circumstances that favor one type of<br>forest or the other<br>so and it coincides with a a beach<br>Master year and Beach seedlings<br>everywhere and um with strike of beach<br>seedlings you'll get of course it won't<br>be pure Beach initially but if if uh if<br>it's kind of within the environmental<br>envelope where you get a NR organic NR<br>economy then Beach eventually takes over<br>completely and conversely um uh if<br>perhaps a beach stand Burns or<br>or it's destroyed by some other kind of<br>disturbance or maybe you know a die back<br>something like that and attack a pinle<br>war or something like that and if that<br>lines up with<br>um Mass seeding BYO whatever then get<br>disturbance I think of some kind would<br>be what flips the<br>switch so I think about some wind throw<br>stands around Cass Beach froster and<br>density of seedlings coming through a<br>beach you know just incredibly thick a<br>so really probably out competing<br>anything else to get established so yeah<br>I mean yeah I don't think that's<br>exclusive to the mechanisms you're<br>proposing amount of SE bank so what<br>elevation are we talking about at C here<br>well that's<br>probably about 700 M sea Lev around 800<br>that's probably within see there's a<br>bunch of other other n trees that could<br>grow there beach has got got hold of<br>area but you could there's no reason why<br>I imagine say thin to wouldn't grow<br>out Char his hand at theot who's<br>actually doing the question<br>you question<br>question is um do you know what nitrogen<br>species organic nitrogen species are<br>being transported by<br>the from the so which organic compounds<br>do they you don't know because to me if<br>they go for the obvious option which is<br>toate um that explains why you don't<br>have metri right because the<br>decomposition of<br>umate leads to nitr and G is also the<br>primary thing the primary organic met<br>species that's transported within the<br>planet so if if and and I think there<br>must be literature on what the um micro<br>rizon do okay y I'll talk to end about<br>that yeah right thank you yeah so the so<br>Lou's<br>um nitrification in inovation hypothesis<br>sub um internationally what's the<br>explanation<br>for dominance of a species so is it Ecto<br>always EO species always seen as tending<br>to be more light demanding some other<br>explanation so that's just a New Zealand<br>yeah it's New Zealand is I mean the<br>South T Zone we've got this it's very<br>different Z of course you have a whole<br>bunch of different ecomic arisal gener<br>including beade to General like<br>don't huge rang yeah no um my uh pair of<br>hypotheses doesn't work for eor mizon in<br>general suggested it works here this<br>situation because we've got that face me<br>so I'm just wondering why so why is it<br>that you have these vast in Forest that<br>or you know what's what's for the stable<br>state of the<br>aops okay<br>so so a vascular micral fungi are<br>believed to cost the plant<br>less<br>so the cheapest<br>option<br>so in environments where where nitrogen<br>is is not too limiting then they're<br>probably the more cost effective option<br>well that that would raise the compation<br>if you've got a more expensive<br>Association you're going need more<br>energy to ex mic yes yes although um<br>that doesn't stop to<br>result so I mean you're saying it's a<br>byproduct metrification process<br>something that well be detected in your<br>probes a byproduct of the um of<br>the extraction of organic notion from<br>organic meod by the eiz fund wonder if<br>mang<br>isail yeah I mean guess it's how the<br>probe works and what form of manganes is<br>that's detected on the<br>probe you wouldn't want to have a<br>situation where the site actually<br>fundamentally is different right mag<br>prevalent that you know it's it is<br>routed through some biotic process so<br>just we should get total manganese from<br>the soil yeah wondered about that do I<br>was thinking you know if these are like<br>Disturbed sites or<br>something something different about the<br>SW yeah chemistry chemistry I'll talk to<br>about<br>so I should put just a bit further about<br>that question not all Ecto funy do this<br>pcking of the of the nation C all of<br>them um that they the plant partners<br>with them when nitrogen is hard to get<br>is hard to C they're presumably more<br>expensive than the um more basic Ecto<br>don't that's been demonstrated quite<br>recy look nit gradient and they've got<br>composition of the um EIC fungal<br>Community changes lot of turnover and<br>it's the the the genes for um organic<br>nitrogen extraction are are concentrated<br>like the plant<br>can choose yeah I'll have you thanks<br>face thanks Chris um yeah guess I just<br>got a couple of specific questions<br>around the um growth rate light<br>availability um graphs you're showing so<br>on one of them I think was for real you<br>yeah that one so um for the so blue<br>is uh one the broadly forest forest it<br>looks to me like that is a rather<br>nonlinear relationship I mean<br>potentially yeah I'm just wondering if<br>using a like a peace wise regression or<br>something like that would actually show<br>that it just looks like a threshold<br>response there where you know below the<br>light levels that you get in Beach<br>Forest it's very minimal growth rate and<br>then it just takes off I mean with<br>pretty messy data but just seems to take<br>off in the same form that you get in the<br>beach Forest where light availability is<br>higher just wondering if did you notice<br>this point up here well yeah I'm kind of<br>ignoring<br>point yeah I'm just wondering if the<br>there's yeah perhaps just a bit of a<br>threshold response there that<br>um I'm not sure I've ever seen a PL<br>respond that way<br>to which um you say you got these from<br>um a nursery some of some of the SE we<br>grew some of them ourselves yeah um and<br>we got so some we got I think four of<br>the species we we went down and we got<br>little seedlings and and<br>um put them in in um put them under the<br>Mist Mist for a while and then put them<br>in um they called those root trainers<br>right and they grew nicely um then we<br>got damping off some of them and so um<br>it affected two the speci I think he<br>know and um we had to buy two of the<br>species from nurseries because we<br>couldn't find any to around them Inwood<br>um and then um I ordered a beach too<br>because I wasn't confident we'd have<br>enough Beach seedlings and I wish I just<br>got to my beach are good because the<br>nursery theing the nursery so us C in<br>contast to<br>them and I should have just I should<br>just thr out I mean it's great doing<br>experiments I think<br>results are pretty good considered<br>knowing how experiments can<br>go I just wanted like I know Ste Hubble<br>in neutral theory has monograph he<br>talked about Panamanian forests of<br>certain species where shade tolerance<br>across well within a species the in<br>specific variation was you know really<br>wide as wide as what they s the specific<br>variation so I just wonder how much<br>phenotypic variation there might be<br>and that that potentially adds a bit of<br>noise to what you're hoping to achieve<br>here yeah I you're probably aware of<br>this<br>already point out obvious I was probably<br>trying not to think about<br>okay yeah I don't know if there's some<br>way you can quantify that not at this St<br>no the seedings not come with their own<br>like arisal<br>the ones we pull out we pluck out for<br>proper and and um those three ones are<br>usually infected<br>withes well whatever they did in isue<br>they did a good job with<br>li but<br>not you know like like take the LI with<br>the to in the ground<br>leaves you you have um a lot of<br>species some sort of surval analysis<br>use<br>STS<br>s sample size kind<br>of I mean they're not even ideal<br>for but we um<br>mortality basically we got mortality and<br>or one more question about the um same<br>one but for Beach um you had the strange<br>and but I mean would that just be<br>because they're they're competing as AMF<br>species right and you know if you block<br>them into<br>a forest there they get the advantage of<br>um shortcutting the you know nitr cycle<br>but otherwise they competing against<br>other other beachs that're doing exactly<br>the same thing and competition is just<br>is I mean if that's signicant result<br>even just<br>invade usually I mean I don't know like<br>it might take a really long time but are<br>these<br>patches growing out or Beach they're<br>pretty remarkably sort of sharp most<br>these<br>PES I mean when they're like when<br>they're regenerating and um you know<br>like H land or something they just<br>basically grow out like one row at a<br>time would they do a similar thing I<br>think written about this that expansion<br>in of beach in Tusk is much faster than<br>in<br>the old explanation they just don't have<br>Theo species present in the<br>soils they would if they hatch right<br>margins but if they disperse into a<br>stand that explanation still used that<br>you know Beach can't dispers they don't<br>have but but surely um you know they<br>have they have above ground fru<br>but do you know if these have you looked<br>into whether or not these patches seem<br>to be like just continuously expanding<br>and eventually St might knock back or<br>something it's probably might looking at<br>the eot maybe there a little this top<br>project I was thinking of doing that<br>actually at um I'm going in shortly to a<br>couple of months to um the other site I<br>showed you Rini corner and initially I<br>thought about trying to measure um kind<br>of use are photos actually to to measure<br>the rate of expansion but then I decided<br>it probably wasn't wasn't feasible<br>because what we'll see mostly is just<br>the growth of the crown tree crowns on<br>ER votage you'd have to do it on the<br>guess to do that I mean presumably it<br>would be that right take a few years to<br>see well these the stands at at um at<br>Rini Corner they all seem to be um it<br>look like they're relatively young um<br>and I think<br>um somebody got some age data stand and<br>none of the trees none of the beach<br>trees are very old they all look like<br>they're about the same age so um there's<br>no huge beach trees in St so so um you<br>would probably would see if you saw any<br>expansion of those patches they just<br>little patches on a sequence of aerial<br>photos or satellite photos you'd<br>probably be see Crow expansion there's<br>no monster trees in there there's<br>nothing bigger than a b except this how<br>there<br>black black Beach here it's a mountain<br>Beach at R is it okay this red Beach you<br>go<br>further west is red Beach coming from<br>so it was um Jeff Rogers who did some<br>walking got one last<br>question out there but I've always<br>wondered about the beach Gap in the<br>South Island I'm wondering if<br>uh I think it just<br>ended<br>but I<br>wonder figure explain well you know<br>there's obviously other hypotheses<br>appears to be slowly invading on both<br>ends of the<br>West<br>very so that con bradle Forest is pretty<br>resilient<br>a in the case of tanaki it's just no<br>beach for the so I don't know how Beach<br>com<br>is another B EV but have to beach to<br>Str but we I mean we know surpr to find<br>Beach growing<br>climate it's just it's pres it's been<br>wiped out by the ice and it just doesn't<br>didn't disperse fast enough to get in<br>other<br>yes<br>yes I'd like to welcome any additional<br>questions to kind of come along with us<br>um there are some people waiting</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
