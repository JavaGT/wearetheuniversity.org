is the concept of combining<br>both Agriculture and solar farming using<br>the same piece of land so the idea is<br>that a solar farm takes up a fair amount<br>of land but there is both a lot of<br>unused land on a solar farm Agri<br>voltaics tries to maximize the land use<br>of Any Given piece of land by utilizing<br>the spare space between rows and<br>underneath the panels for growing<br>agriculture or for grazing animals while<br>also generating energy from that land so<br>effectively you get more than 100% land<br>use whereas the agriculture or the solar<br>farming alone would give you less than<br>that I was reading newspapers and seeing<br>some articles come through around New<br>Zealand's gold moved to be 100%<br>renewable energy by 2030 articles around<br>solar Farms coming to New Zealand<br>basically I got involved with the Agro<br>voles project from a place of concern<br>about what that meant for high quality<br>food producing land which is probably<br>where some of the solar Farms are best<br>suited to and just that competition for<br>land use I just thought well surely<br>there's got to be a way we can do both<br>perhaps tweak both systems to find a<br>optimal system we we can still farm and<br>carry out that food production while<br>also generating a renewable energy<br>source on the same<br>side we do research on a variety of<br>renewable energies uh one of those<br>aspects is is micro grids and looking at<br>making communities more resilient and<br>we've also been working in the Solar<br>photovoltaic space looking at the<br>performance of PV systems and<br>appropriateness of those PV systems and<br>integrated with micr grids this led us<br>into to looking at farming communities<br>and making farming communities more<br>resilient Agro voltaics is quite new to<br>New Zealand it's still being explored<br>they might be some small trials around<br>at the moment but has not been done on<br>any sort of larger scale infr as well as<br>Tambo and Victoria University have been<br>working to see how best this could be<br>used in the New Zealand context we did a<br>GIS analysis across the country which<br>showed that we have vast amount of<br>agricultural land that's entirely<br>suitable for for Agri volic systems it's<br>not going to be possible in all cases to<br>build really big solar Farms so working<br>with Farmers to look at those panics<br>that are<br>suitable and sizing of systems that are<br>appropriate for our Distribution Systems<br>where we need to feed that electricity<br>in is a key aspect that we're now<br>currently investigating with a number of<br>of different Farmers around the<br>country yeah I think everyone's looking<br>to to diversify a you know like we're<br>looking for other options that we can do<br>within our farm gate a so like anything<br>like this I think it's probably you know<br>it you'd be remiss not to look into it<br>at least or at least give it an<br>opportunity to see if it could work<br>within where you are but if it doesn't<br>impact your day today farming or<br>business then go for gold I reckon yeah<br>livestock because of their mobile<br>grazing nature potentially a good fit<br>with solar panels because they won't<br>leave anything to waste<br>in the talara district we've got a<br>number of communities that are at the<br>end of single electricity cables and<br>those communities are developing all the<br>time more lifestyl is moving into some<br>of those communities you start adding<br>EVS into the equation and the Lions<br>companies got some real problems they<br>recognize those problems and that's some<br>of the conversations that we' been<br>having with<br>them Agri voltaics you need a really<br>good level of planning and planning<br>around how to fix the environment how to<br>affix the farming activities and also<br>how to affix The Wider community and<br>that's both the visual look of it but<br>also the impact it can have in terms of<br>bringing additional and alternative<br>Revenue to<br>Farmers I think Agri volic has huge<br>potential in New Zealand New Zealand is<br>a country where a lot of the flat land<br>that's really well suited for solar is<br>currently used for agriculture so<br>there's a natural conflict there between<br>what do we want to use the land for<br>voltaic sort of avoids that conflict<br>entirely by saying let's do both so I<br>think there's massive potential I think<br>we'll likely first see this taking off<br>on smaller Farms with small scale Trails<br>before it's moved to larger Farms I<br>think it'll depend very much upon the<br>farmer and what their priorities are on<br>whether they want AGR voltaics on their<br>Farm there's a bit of a conflict between<br>the optimum commercial Returns versus<br>Optimum land use and whether they value<br>A diversity of different income streams<br>and different Revenue models on their<br>solar farm or Agri volic Farm or whether<br>they're just looking to optimize<br>financially and so that sort of leads<br>you down different Technical Solutions<br>as<br>well I think Farmers recognize that<br>there is going to be this movement to<br>renewable energy and there's a lot of<br>farmers who are open to exploring the<br>opportunities that might bring for<br>themselves and their communities<br>obviously there are questions and<br>concerns that need to be addressed but<br>the overall openness to the concept has<br>been really<br>positive we see AG voltages as being a<br>real opportunity for the farming<br>Community as we know our agricultural<br>sector accounts for nearly 50% of our<br>carbon emissions and so there's been<br>quite a lot of focus on our farming<br>community in terms of how they can<br>reduce the carbon footprint Agri volts<br>offers the farmers the opportunity to<br>actually be part of the solution to<br>generate green electricity carbon- free<br>electricity that actually means a<br>reduction in the carbon emissions of the<br>economy as a whole this potentially<br>offsets any carbon<br>that's associated with normal operating<br>practices of of of farmers and so this<br>is why we are quite excited to be<br>working with Farmers to be part of the<br>solution for this just transition that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
