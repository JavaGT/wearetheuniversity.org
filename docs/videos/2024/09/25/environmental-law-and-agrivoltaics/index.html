project<br>um to their land then you have to go<br>through the RMA at the moment most<br>people know all about the RMA and it's<br>both the planning framework which<br>Regional local councils have to make<br>plans for and a lot of people's input<br>into but it's also the other side the<br>consenting framework under those plans<br>that you're going to know what's a<br>permitted activity and what you need to<br>get a resource consent for far in<br>particular are very well aware of that<br>range of um activities that need you<br>know permits um what you can do with<br>your water what you can do with your<br>land what you can do with your trees<br>that kind of thing any Agro voltaic<br>project at present is going to need a<br>resource consent there are no plans<br>around the country that have already got<br>them as permitted activities for example<br>you're going to need some kind of<br>resource consent and there are going to<br>be probably more than one one type of<br>consent to go through both at the<br>Regional Council level and at the local<br>Council level so you know that you're<br>going to need to put poles in the ground<br>you need to cover a large area it's<br>going to look very different with shiny<br>big solar panels covering um a large<br>amount of ground that reflects the sun<br>you might have to have Earthworks to<br>build roads you might be building<br>shelter belts there's a huge number of<br>activities that might affect the soil<br>the water and the view and then maybe<br>any indigenous plants and animals flora<br>and FAA you're going to need resource<br>consense from your Regional Council in<br>relation to maybe the water runoff<br>panels are you going to need to dig<br>drains then the soil and the sediment<br>control that's a significant concern the<br>Regional Council want to make sure<br>that's been thought about but the polls<br>for the Earthworks um is another one are<br>you going to build roads your local<br>Council you might need a consent for<br>earthw works all of those will be bu<br>often bundled together for uh at least<br>the local Council and the regional and<br>sometimes you can bundle them all<br>together in one application um and they<br>can be treated sometimes together in one<br>application say one hearing um one set<br>of decision makers for the whole lot you<br>can see from the scale of the<br>developments that um and all those<br>possible um consents and the different<br>types of effects that it might have um<br>so in or in any consent you have to<br>provide the councils with all the<br>information that they will need to<br>assess those effects they want to make<br>sure that the benefits of your AGR<br>voltaic project don't come at too many<br>costs and that everything's been<br>considered all of those effects need to<br>be studied and provided to the council<br>in advance so you're going to actually<br>need to engage with someone um who can<br>assess those sometimes you might go to a<br>One-Stop resource consenting person um<br>there could be a outfit that will have<br>access to for example the planners who<br>can tell you what the rules are in your<br>local plan every Council around the<br>country has got different rules right<br>that's the whole point of the RMA at the<br>moment it's um a designed to let<br>communities set their own rules right um<br>within an overarching National policy um<br>framework but communities choose your<br>rules so it means they're different all<br>around the country that's one key point<br>you can't say just because say S one<br>District Council got one through doesn't<br>mean w is going to right so uh you got<br>rules and then of course everyone even<br>within the same district you've got<br>different land different effects some<br>are on Hills some some might be near<br>wapu um that know that's not going to be<br>affected now with you maybe sheep and<br>normal farming but would be affected<br>with construction so you still need to<br>get all of those effects<br>assessed uh and so you get a planner<br>typically to tell you what the rules in<br>the plan are that you need I mean lawyer<br>will do the same thing um but you then<br>they're going to advise you on the<br>people you'll need to assess those<br>effects you might need an ecologist to<br>tell you are there any endangered<br>species in your area that your<br>construction is going to affect um you<br>might need a landscape visual artist a<br>landscape assessment to say what is that<br>going to look like are you right next to<br>I mean what say you did it on the planes<br>beneath tato Peak that's going to<br>completely change the view from tato<br>Peak right um would would that be a<br>consideration that everyone would object<br>to you're saying you're ruining the<br>Aesthetics from somewhere else by having<br>to look at your ugly ugra voltaic array<br>right uh that is a concern you might<br>need a landscape assessment for that<br>kind of thing yeah there's a whole range<br>of possible effects you might need a<br>cultural um assessment report um for any<br>effects on say uh cultural heritage uh<br>in the area you you'll need a<br>geotechnical report to make sure the<br>land is stable enough to have the polls<br>and um there have been there's one uh<br>consent that was applied for where the<br>site was over an old landfill so they<br>needed a soil contamination expert to<br>see to make sure the poles weren't going<br>to dig down too far right and get into<br>the old landfill material and release<br>contaminants from underneath so it<br>really what you need depends on your<br>site but you have to be able to assure a<br>consenting decision maker that you've<br>considered all of the possible um<br>effects and that also includes the<br>benefits remember not just the negative<br>effects but also the positive effects<br>you might have an economist or someone<br>who can talk about the jobs if you talk<br>to your solar developer they'll be able<br>to provide the financial assessment<br>about and the energy inputs your what<br>you can produce what you can uh give the<br>grid you know and then what benefit that<br>could make to the community um as well<br>as the individual so yeah there's<br>individual benefits but also community<br>and maybe National benefits that can be<br>assessed all of that needs to be in an<br>application and of course so there you<br>can imagine on some of these big ones<br>some of those applications to run to<br>hundreds of pages you need a lot of<br>different reports from experts to be<br>able to persuade a decision maker that<br>you've thought of everything and<br>nothing's going to go wrong because of<br>those considerations every single<br>project is completely site specific you<br>can get some guidance um I really pays<br>so all of the planners and the lawyers<br>will be looking at all of the other<br>projects that have been either approved<br>or denied so all the planners and the<br>lawyers who work in this area will be<br>looking at all the previous decisions<br>the ones that were approved the ones<br>that were denied and to look at exactly<br>what it was so to give you an example<br>just recently in the same month the one<br>project was approved down in the South<br>iseland and another one was denied<br>completely different sites right<br>completely different um consenting<br>bodies as well but one of them was on<br>Crown pastoral land with a lot of<br>threatened indigenous<br>biodiversity um that one and but they<br>hadn't given the information about what<br>the effects would be on their<br>biodiversity they hadn't done the right<br>assessments and it was actually denied<br>on lack of information um and and the<br>risk of damaging that biodiversity if<br>they'd had the information and shown<br>there wasn't the risk they might have<br>got through but you uh the one that was<br>approved um even though it was over a<br>possible contaminated site they had the<br>all the information um otherwise it was<br>a normal Farm uh been used for<br>agriculture there wasn't a threat of<br>biodiversity loss um and the benefits uh<br>were clear so they just every single<br>one's got completely different<br>circumstances different rules they play<br>by and different assessments so the<br>pastal lease one didn't need a geot<br>technical soil contamination assessment<br>whereas um some of the landscape um some<br>of the same landscape considerations<br>weren't needed um on the the other<br>agricultural list if you've got a<br>wetland you're definitely going to need<br>um an ecolog just assessing what you<br>need to do for the Wetland you might<br>need to be doing some fencing that if<br>you haven't already and another aspect<br>of the site<br>specificity right is every Community is<br>different and where how they get their<br>energy right um we have a lot of<br>communities with a lot of solar or solar<br>just starting um but the grid is also<br>different all right what it can handle<br>and so you that's an assessment that<br>your solar developer will make and um<br>this may be an unfortunate aspect of the<br>grid as it is at present but if you've<br>already got a number of solar rays you<br>might find it more difficult to add your<br>one to the mix and so in some respect at<br>the moment because of the grid and the<br>way it's set up it's a little bit like<br>first and first served in your local<br>community to connect to that grid so<br>another aspect you're going to have to<br>consider or maybe not you but your solar<br>developer and will again will have to<br>provide um a report on this to the<br>benefits is your local grid every local<br>grid has a different capacity so you<br>going to have to get an assessment of<br>what it can handle and how big your<br>project can be what is economic in your<br>particular situation so remember what<br>we're talking about here is the large<br>solar arrays energy provision that goes<br>back to the grid we're not talking about<br>the small not necessarily talking about<br>the small ones that a farmer might use<br>for their own purposes everything is<br>going to depend on the plan obviously<br>what's permitted and what's uh needs a<br>consent but we're generally only needing<br>a cons consent for the large ones and<br>remember of course because all the plans<br>differ in different areas um every city<br>district and region uh might have<br>different rules so obviously you have to<br>check on what you're allowed to do as of<br>right but generally then all the rest of<br>the things that I'm talking about<br>needing a consent those are for the the<br>very large ones that we're talking about<br>feeding energy into the grid so it's an<br>industrial type activity or certainly a<br>commercial one but it's an industrial<br>size of producing energy to feed back<br>people so one of the really important<br>parts of the consenting process um and<br>most people are concerned about is when<br>the public can get involved um or the<br>notification of your consent uh and what<br>that means for the people around you one<br>of the first things you might might want<br>to do after you've got an initial<br>description of the project and maybe<br>some of the assessments you know from<br>your solar developer and perhaps some of<br>the um the other experts that have been<br>contracted to write about it you have to<br>have some kind of idea of the project<br>the scale what it's going to look like<br>have some drawings right one of the<br>early things you should do is consider<br>talking to neighbors and other members<br>of the community to get some feedback<br>back one of the sticking points you'll<br>often find in the process is what we<br>call the notification process um so<br>because any consent now the council has<br>to decide whether a consent is going to<br>be notified just to the neighbors or to<br>the whole public right and at the moment<br>because Agro voltaic arrays are quite<br>new communities aren't used to having<br>them uh most people don't like new<br>things<br>so one of the considerations for a<br>council in deciding whether to make<br>something um to notify it publicly is<br>the novelty and whether people will<br>object or not and in the Wier upper for<br>example that novelty and the visual<br>effects being very different was the<br>reason for notifying to the Public<br>Public notification slows your process<br>of consenting down and it makes it more<br>expensive Ive so it's really good to<br>early on have once you've got an idea of<br>your project you might want to Workshop<br>it you know around informally if you<br>have a small community um just to see if<br>you can maybe get some tweaks that<br>people will like your experts will also<br>be able to advise for example on what's<br>the best Landscaping so you don't ruin<br>people's views you you might need um an<br>expert to consider the light reflection<br>right because these do bounce light off<br>if you're an area with hills and roads<br>are you going to be ruining the vision<br>of drivers with light reflecting and<br>bouncing the rise as they're driving<br>especially on a major highway on a hill<br>nearby you know that can also be um a<br>matter<br>for um say reserves uh significant<br>natural areas significant natural<br>landscape areas you might need to assess<br>the light reflection so that's why you<br>need to get the assessment from the<br>experts first um to be able to say well<br>these things are things to think about<br>and these are what might be the<br>effects and then ask them what are the<br>ways to mitigate them uh and your but<br>your neighbors might also have<br>suggestions for what will mitigate it<br>for them and if the neighbors are all<br>happy with it uh you can actually get<br>their sign off to say they're happy with<br>the conditions and that will make your<br>so the time frame is going to vary<br>completely as to what the council<br>decides it needs if you've got all of<br>the information which might include um<br>all the assessment of the effects you<br>might include permission from the<br>neighbors then that could go through<br>really quickly if it gets decided in<br>house and Council and doesn't go to an<br>independent consenting panel and if it<br>doesn't require public notification you<br>can actually get them through quite<br>quickly but if it's going to go to<br>notification<br>uh especially public notification and if<br>it goes to a panel um then that can take<br>an extra few months a panel might make a<br>decision have a hearing once it's had a<br>hearing it's got to make a decision<br>really quickly it's it's what you don't<br>know in advance and so that's where a<br>consenting team can help you um tell you<br>what you need to do to satisfy all the<br>requirements in the RMA and if you get<br>those in and you try and do it properly<br>you can often get it through quite<br>quickly um where a lot of them have<br>fallen down and being denied as well as<br>being delayed is when you don't have<br>enough information especially about<br>environmental<br>effects the renewable energy generation<br>National policy statement that was<br>introduced in<br>201 and it didn't have AGR voltaic solar<br>arrays so we already currently have a<br>national policy statement framework that<br>tells councils they should be<br>prioritizing renewable energy<br>development but um AGR voltaic arrays<br>don't fit neatly into the requirements<br>and the words so there's a review<br>underway at the moment for the whole<br>National policy framework to make Agro<br>volic arrays um easier to<br>approve so there are lots of changes<br>that happen in the RMA regularly uh and<br>especially in response to um renewable<br>energy development because we know that<br>for climate change purposes we need to<br>be completely renewable as as soon as<br>possible Net Zero by 2050 is like the<br>minimum okay so and in order to get Net<br>Zero we have to have our renewable<br>energy component ramped up um I think<br>we've got a goal of 100% renewable<br>electricity by<br>2030 um and 50% renewable of all of our<br>energy requirements in New Zealand<br>including like say fuel for transport<br>things like that so that's going to<br>require a lot more shifting to the grid<br>and it's going to require more changes<br>to the r to get these projects through<br>more quickly and more easily I should<br>say it doesn't necessarily mean quickly<br>but it means to prioritize them over say<br>objections on The View one big issue is<br>going to be is what um what other<br>matters and effects would they be<br>prioritized over for example what about<br>those environmental effects the<br>endangered species and and the crown<br>Past release is renewable energy really<br>important to put there as well or should<br>we be prior prioritizing it elsewhere so<br>we don't know exactly what the framework<br>will be for the new um proposals and<br>where it's going to go forward but we<br>are certainly going to see even more<br>changes to the RMA to prioritize AGR<br>volic arrays the RMA of course has<br>changed in relation to different<br>political priorities and different<br>factual situations um social priorities<br>that we find ourselves um in um one<br>example um that has actually enabled<br>fast tracking of large projects which<br>could include AGR voltaic arrays is the<br>covid-19 FasTrack process that was one<br>designed to facilitate um energy and<br>other infrastructure<br>projects uh and to make them to get<br>through more easily it was also a jobs<br>and an economic benefit um underlying<br>that as a reason for doing it this<br>covid-19 fast trck process enabled<br>infrastructure and very large<br>development projects to go through a<br>little bit or a lot more quickly than if<br>they'd gone through the RMA process that<br>had a completely separate set of rules<br>and decision makers um had its own panel<br>retired environment Court Judge chairing<br>it but it had a panel of decision makers<br>and um a much faster process fewer<br>considerations um probably less<br>paperwork overall uh they still had a<br>hearing and you still had to have a lot<br>of information about the effects but<br>they were able to get through projects<br>more quickly the new coalition<br>government has proposed an even faster<br>track including renewable energy<br>projects and one that will replace even<br>that covid-19 process so we may find<br>that these renewable energy projects<br>could get through even more quickly so<br>in one sense it's bypassing the RMA<br>we've yet to see what information<br>they're going to require they're<br>probably still going to require all of<br>that information about effects and<br>assessments it's just a much FASTT track</p></main><footer
