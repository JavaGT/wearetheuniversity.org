interesting<br>exploration of place name signs in New<br>Zealand sign<br>language so whatever language people use<br>in whatever country culture or place<br>they need to refer to local places in<br>their language and so today we're going<br>to explore just a little bit about how<br>this works in New Zealand sign language<br>Zealand in early New Zealand sign<br>language when I say early I mean um<br>perhaps from before about<br>1980 or so there was a very small set of<br>ways of naming places and there was in<br>fact a sign that generically referred to<br>many towns and cities and this sign<br>remains today as the sign for Oakland<br>which is interesting it remains for<br>Oakland and it remains for inago so I'm<br>sign<br>Oakland also the same sign form this is<br>the um sign from the dictionary drawing<br>for in Carle so that was a sign that<br>older def people would have used for<br>many place names in New Zealand and it<br>relied of course on also lip reading the<br>name of the<br>place so moving<br>on in 19 2014 the online dictionary of<br>nzsl recorded 39 New Zealand place names<br>which is not really a lot and the<br>geographic Board of New Zealand<br>suggested to us that it would be good to<br>document more place names signs um and<br>I'm speaking to you in my role as<br>somebody who is an editor of the New<br>Zealand sign language dictionary so when<br>I say us I mean my research team so they<br>suggested that it would be good to<br>record more place name signs because<br>it's important in a practical sense for<br>for example you've probably Seen On TV<br>whenever there's a civil emergency such<br>as an earthquake or a flood or um uh<br>landslides and so on that there will be<br>interpreters interpreting safety<br>briefings or providing information about<br>what suburbs have been affected what<br>roads are closed where to go for water<br>where to go for help and so that entails<br>a lot of uh location information and it<br>would be helpful for interpreters and<br>people associated with the de Community<br>to have a place where they could go and<br>find out what other relevant signs for<br>those place<br>names also deaf children in schools who<br>are studying Alo geography history Etc<br>um important for them to have a<br>reference source for place names and now<br>of course there are many many people<br>learning New Zealand sign language as<br>adults and they want to be able to<br>locate themselves and say where they<br>come from whether they're Mali wanting<br>to do a Pepa or par just talking about<br>where they live and locations it's<br>important to have access to place name<br>science and so we undertook a project to<br>to document more signs resulting in now<br>a collection of<br>495 New Zealand plac Nam signs in the<br>online<br>dictionary and these signs were<br>collected from De people all around the<br>country in 13 different places we went<br>to um over a 100 De people contributed<br>and the the aim was to document the<br>place names that de people in<br>communities in different places were<br>actually using it was not a matter of<br>creating signs it was documenting what<br>de people actually use amongst<br>themselves so one thing that's a little<br>bit different about researching place<br>names in a sign language compared to a<br>spoken language is that there is no real<br>historical record there are no books or<br>Maps or um sources that you can refer to<br>so you're relying on people's living<br>people's memory maybe older Generations<br>current Generations so um it's a<br>different sort of Enterprise to be<br>documenting um what is just TR names<br>that are used face to face amongst<br>time so today I'm not my aim is not to<br>teach you a list of Nam signs for places<br>but you are going to learn some along<br>the way but um I want to give you a<br>little bit of background understanding<br>about how place names come to be and the<br>different types of ways that diff people<br>create place names so the first thing<br>that's important to be aware of is that<br>when diff people who are deaf from<br>childhood um are growing up their<br>experience of language and general<br>knowledge about their country is very<br>different because they do not overhear<br>conversations or media um people uh<br>things that are going on perhaps at<br>school so there's just a lot less<br>exposure to people talking about places<br>and names and so it's a different<br>process of um understanding how you<br>refer to places in the<br>world also for many deaf people who are<br>deaf from childhood literacy is a big<br>barrier it's not um as accessible to De<br>children and so that's also not<br>necessarily an easy way for de people to<br>identify place names through literacy<br>so for sign language users people who<br>are deaf their experience of the world<br>and the languages around them is<br>primarily<br>visual so what we see in face name signs<br>is contact between these experiences<br>between New Zealand sign language which<br>exists in a visual modality and using<br>the hands and body but also of course<br>overlapping with in contact with Mari<br>place names both spoken in written and<br>English place names spoken and written<br>so it's kind of a zone of language<br>contact and yet the actual place names<br>that def people use are not a direct<br>equivalent necessarily of either of<br>those<br>languages so when we look at the large<br>collection of place name signs that we<br>have we identified patterns or<br>categories for the ways that these place<br>names are created and these are five<br>quite typical ways that that place names<br>come about and these are all based on um<br>visual strategies for naming and for<br>referring to<br>places that term toponym is just a more<br>technical term for place<br>names so the first category of way of<br>creating name signs is to base a name<br>sign on a visual Landmark something that<br>people can see that's quite iconic and<br>obvious in a<br>place um secondly signs that might be<br>based on something that's very well<br>known about the place an activity that<br>typically happens there maybe something<br>in its history or um the way that people<br>see uh a place in terms of the people or<br>um a reputation of a<br>place<br>thirdly sometimes um place name signs do<br>draw on the written<br>um form of a name and they might<br>translate part of that or the whole the<br>whole of that word fourthly there's a<br>category which is kind of interesting<br>which is like word play where a sign<br>will be based on what the lip pattern of<br>part of that name looks like in speech<br>and I'll give you some<br>examples and also fifthly of course sign<br>languages do have systems for bingus<br>spell letters and so that's quite a<br>useful strategy for referring to written<br>um place names and these might be used<br>on their own or sometimes combined with<br>an extra bit like a movement or an extra<br>sign so now I'm going to run through and<br>these so there are quite a few place<br>name signs that are based on a very<br>obvious or iconic landmark<br>such as the sign for taranaki which is<br>references both the the mountain and the<br>that please feel free to copy the signs<br>as we watch them that might help you<br>take some away so this sign which<br>obviously references mountain or Monga<br>um is also used to refer to other uh<br>mountains such as rangit too and others<br>it's not necessarily unique to<br>tanaki but remember that when people<br>talk about places they're always in a<br>local context so if you use a sign for<br>Monga and you're in maybe the bottom<br>half of the North Island then you know<br>it will be understood that you're<br>talking about tanaki as opposed to if<br>you're an Oakland it might it would be<br>understood that perhaps you're referring<br>to Lang<br>Toral so other examples of landmark<br>inspired place names uh pretty famous<br>One Rua you can see from the picture<br>to very<br>descriptive um and some of the towns<br>around New Zealand have you know<br>sculptured or physical icons in them and<br>Tha happppy is one example of that which<br>de people now refer to by by the sign<br>Gumboot some places are named or an<br>activity that is known to be typically<br>associated with the place so we have a<br>sign that represents drag racing which<br>is something that happens in Med medy<br>it's most probably famous<br>let play m m<br>again or this sign for Moa which is um<br>well known to be the site of a large<br>freezing works and presumably a lot of<br>people work<br>there so the sign representing mua<br>butchering because that is the<br>association that death people have with<br>another interesting um variation on this<br>is that there might be a set of places<br>where there's a similar activity<br>occurring and the local de people will<br>create signs that reflect that but maybe<br>with slight variations so for example<br>there are a number of suburbs which have<br>a race course which are all referred to<br>whether it's um Ally in Oakland or<br>reton um no sorry Addington in Christ<br>Church which may have the same sign<br>referring to horse<br>racing in this case you will recognize<br>immediately that these four places are<br>all Air Force bases and um the signs<br>that are created for them reflect<br>something to do with planes or and<br>there's an odd one out you can spot that<br>wigram and you can imagine how that came<br>about using the handshape of a<br>plane<br>Wilson okay a little bit less<br>stayed the noie at the<br>bottom plane<br>landing and then this is the the<br>outlier but as you can see it's still<br>visually inspired by the cap of an Air<br>Force um<br>Personnel so although the the motivation<br>for those signs is the same it's all to<br>do with Air Force the way that the sign<br>is actually formed varies according to<br>use some name signs reflect s people's<br>perception of a place or perhaps wider<br>societies you know knowledge of what a<br>place is is known for so this first sign<br>for these suburb names which all are in<br>different cities of Oakland Christ<br>Church and<br>Wellington what they have in common is<br>that they're all perceived as quite<br>affluent suburbs or areas expensive<br>areas and remembering that most if<br>people can't afford to live in such<br>suburbs so their perception from outside<br>is that these areas are rather um Elite<br>or Posh you could say and so there's a<br>sign that touches the nose to indicate<br>that m in the Nelson area is uh known<br>for uh being a place where people can<br>sunbathe without clothes on the beach<br>and so the sign that references that is<br>a sign which means literally to take<br>clothes<br>off some name signs of places um<br>reference an historical event something<br>that's happened or an historical<br>Association of the place which would be<br>known of course to De people but to<br>wider Society so a good example of this<br>Tangi and the reference there is to the<br>scroll and denan of course most famously<br>historically associated with the Scots<br>so we<br>get bag pipes which is an indirect<br>reference to<br>Scots so that kind of um naming or<br>reference to a thing which reference is<br>a bigger set of meaning is called in<br>linguistics called momy where you get a<br>whole place name signs can change over<br>the time and generations as well so<br>depending on perhaps a change in<br>something about the character or<br>activity of a place it the sign might<br>change to reflect that so a good example<br>is for Mora where the slightly older<br>sign reference is tobacco which was the<br>main crop there until the cigarette<br>industry declined um and this is I'll<br>show you the sign on the left for<br>that you can see the link to Tobacco<br>there I'm<br>sure and a slightly more current sign is<br>picking you can see the reference to<br>pulling apples or round fruit off a tree<br>so we do see change natural change<br>within the de<br>Community okay so I mentioned that um<br>finger spelling is also a strategy where<br>you can simply reflect something about<br>the spelling of a name and we see this<br>in signs like Christ Church in paliston<br>North I'll show you Christ Church I<br>okay so there we get<br>PN so there are many many name signs<br>strategy some signs which involve finger<br>spelling also add a movement so it's not<br>just a straight p and an N for example<br>but it's in the case of Wellington a w<br>hand shape which is actually from an<br>American finger spelling system<br>movement some people say it's to do with<br>the wind but don't know that might just<br>be folk law and gizon is formed by a g<br>but with the addition of Sunrise because<br>it giz been as famous as the first place<br>in New Zealand where the sunrises I'll<br>some place name signs do actually<br>translate an element or a part of the<br>written or spoken name usually not the<br>whole name but a part of it that has a<br>recognizable meaning so for the suburb<br>of Mornington for example that is<br>referred to by a sign that means morning<br>you can see the drawing here probably<br>see the interpreted sign signing<br>it and on place on Wy<br>Island again although this word has two<br>parts in Mai just one part the most sort<br>of salient or interesting part I suppose<br>um is translated the cry part the tongy<br>part so it's represented by the signed<br>cry which references meaning in the same<br>I mentioned that there are um there's a<br>category of place name signs which are<br>like word play where the the sign name<br>is based on a meaning that looks like<br>the word on the lips<br>so Katty catty is often pronounced in<br>general New Zealand as caty caty and de<br>people will have seen that on people's<br>lips a lot and so comes to be kn by the<br>cat so absolutely nothing to do with the<br>meaning just simply based on visual<br>observation of how this word looks on<br>people's<br>lips and it doesn't matter whether the<br>name the name is in English or in Mai de<br>people will use the same strategy to um<br>refer to that place so here's an example<br>for<br>Silverdale which has two parts sign<br>silver and then the sign tail because<br>lips so it's kind of just a fun these<br>are fun little word plays based on I<br>guess lip reading<br>Rhymes but they are the regular names<br>for these<br>places so to wrap<br>up I hope you've got the um you've just<br>had a little bit of understanding today<br>that place name signs are signs that<br>develop among de people as they interact<br>together and communicate with each other<br>about places that they need to refer<br>to so place name signs are not a set of<br>signs that are a onetoone equivalent<br>that translate spoken names or<br>necessarily have any relationship to the<br>origin of spoken names um that it's a<br>parallel system where de people will<br>create their own names according to<br>their own knowledge or perception of<br>places so the system of names is is<br>independent in a way but of course also<br>overlaps with spoken language names in<br>some<br>ways so nzsl place names really are<br>based in De people's visual experience<br>of the world because it's a language<br>that exists in a visual modality and it<br>incorporates these elements of reference<br>using creatively elements from indl from<br>English and from<br>Mai but always they're created out of<br>the cultural knowledge of De people sort<br>of in local local communities but also<br>in the National community and based on<br>visual cues and what's what they see and<br>what they know about places and of<br>course there's that lovely element of<br>humor which often goes into place name<br>signs and we see this sometimes in<br>well so thank you very much for taking<br>the time to join us today just like to<br>acknowledge that um a good part of the<br>research that allowed us to document a<br>lot of place name signs and ndsl was<br>supported by the ndsl fund which is MSD<br>funding through a grant back in 2015 and<br>um our work on the online dictionary<br>continues to be supported from fund so<br>if you would like to find out a place<br>name for your locality or your<br>destination do go to the online<br>dictionary of nzsl and check it out I<br>believe that the link has been put into<br>the chat for you if you want to find<br>that thanks for being here today and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
