Nuclear annihilation? The next pandemic? Professor Priestley’s career as a science writer has seen her engage with the Covid-19 pandemic, nuclear histories of New Zealand and Antarctica, climate change, and sea level rise. Through the disciplines of science communication, history of science, and creative non-fiction, her books, essays and academic articles respond to the big questions that keep her up at night. <br><br>In this inaugural lecture, Professor Priestley, from the School of Science in Society, talks about these issues and shares how writing has given her a way to explore and respond to her anxieties about the future.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>noooot C so my name is Nick Smith for<br>those who don't know me and I'm the vice<br>Chancellor here at Victoria University<br>to heading awako and it's my enormous<br>pleasure this evening uh to welcome you<br>all to the university and particularly<br>to the inaugural lecture of Professor<br>Rebecca Presley who is the professor of<br>Science and<br>society and these are always wonderful<br>events for our university community and<br>I always look forward to them but I've<br>been particularly looking forward to<br>this event uh because uh I think you<br>know Rebecca is the embodiment of uh<br>what I think of as the Renaissance<br>academic uh she started at this<br>University with a Bachelor of Science<br>and geology in the very early 90s which<br>was followed by an honors<br>degree uh and then almost three decades<br>later book ended that with a master of<br>arts and creative writing with<br>distinction in<br>2018 in<br>between she really did something quite<br>extraordinary for anyone who's ever done<br>a PhD was that she did a PhD while also<br>having three children and writing two<br>books um I can only imagine what that<br>would have been like uh I have only<br>two-thirds of those children and none of<br>those<br>books um but she did that with uh<br>part-time um she suspended it period but<br>finished and then I think again in an<br>extraordinary way accelerated her career<br>so that air uh 12 years later here she<br>is as a full Professor the highest<br>academic honor of this<br>institution uh her teaching and writing<br>have influenced both in the academic uh<br>and scholarly realm and also in uh the<br>public where I think increasingly it's<br>incredibly important for both the social<br>license of our academics and the social<br>license of her University uh her primary<br>academic discipline is the history of<br>science with a focus on science in New<br>Zealand and<br>Antarctica but she also aims to educate<br>the public in the climate emerc<br>the realities and challenges of sea<br>level rise in RTR and the way that<br>scientists work and contribute on<br>problems trained in Earth sciences and<br>the history of Sciences and creative<br>writing that is a very powerful Trilogy<br>to bring to what I think we all would<br>think we would all understand is a very<br>much an existential problem for<br>ourselves for the next Generations for<br>the country and for the planet as a<br>whole um as an interdisciplinary scholar<br>and creative non-fiction writer she<br>works at the boundaries between science<br>science and Humanities collaborating<br>with Scientists social scientists<br>science communicators and<br>artists this is a career which has been<br>built on two those two different spheres<br>before her academic career she had more<br>than 20 years in science Communication<br>in<br>rra uh and following that she co-founded<br>with Ryan smon science and society and<br>science communication program here which<br>as of last year is now a full School of<br>Science and Society in addition to the<br>two books she wrote while doing her PhD<br>she has written five more she's<br>contributed multi she's contributed<br>multi-million dollars of uh of research<br>funding through six different projects<br>uh she's an investigator in how our<br>changing Coast research program and she<br>also co-leads tuno matini funded science<br>and statistics and media project with<br>uh she's been Antarctica three times uh<br>on media and education Outreach programs<br>and has filled a wide array of<br>leadership roles in this University and<br>as she has just told me she has also<br>done the most important role in this<br>whole university which was uh as the<br>years there was an equally long list of<br>awards and I am going to read them<br>because I am concerned that um Rebecca<br>will be too modest to highlight them<br>herself she has received the science<br>ministers science Comm sorry the prime<br>minister's science communication prize<br>in<br>2016 uh she's a companion of the Royal<br>Society she's a member of the melting<br>ice Rising Seas team that won the prime<br>minister's science prize in 2020 she has<br>the New Zealand science book prize in<br>2008 and her books end times last year<br>and 15 million years on Antarctica were<br>long listed for the New Zealand book<br>awards in tonight's lecture I'm told<br>there will be humor I'm told there will<br>be profanity and that will be interlaced<br>with big questions questions that<br>apparently keep Rebecca up at night<br>through the disciplines of science<br>communication History Science and<br>creative<br>non-fiction questions of how we have<br>engaged with covid-19 pandemic what the<br>nuclear histories of New Zealand and<br>Antarctica are climate change and sea<br>level rise the way that writing has<br>given her a way to explore and respond<br>to her anxieties for the future it is my<br>great pleasure to introduce Professor<br>Vice<br>Chancellor thank you all for coming um I<br>feel quite exhausted after that<br>introduction um in particular thanks to<br>my family um my colleagues from the<br>School of Science and Society my writer<br>friends um and the people who over the<br>years have helped me by giving me a job<br>or a place to work um and just thinking<br>about the people from this University<br>that would be professors Mike croia<br>Charles doy David bbby David Harper as<br>well as the late Paul Callahan and Lydia<br>wavers in this lecture I'm going to talk<br>a bit about my academic journey I guess<br>but also hopefully share some<br>interesting things about our history and<br>the world we live in<br>today my preferred mode of communication<br>is writing um but after more than 10<br>years as an academic I've got used to<br>speaking in front of a crowd um and<br>perhaps it's in my blood I do come from<br>a long line of Educators mostly School<br>teachers um many of whom wore robes like<br>this to teaching in the classroom every<br>day um and there are also many uh<br>thespians in my family there's<br>definitely um a performance aspect to<br>this event um with dress ups and<br>all um so I don't take it for granted<br>that I have got to this position of<br>being a professor um when I studied here<br>in the late 1980s as an undergr graduate<br>in the research School of Earth Sciences<br>um not only were there no women<br>professors there were no women academics<br>in the school at all um and I think in<br>the five years I spent getting a BSC<br>honors I only ever had two female<br>lecturers and they were U Jillian Turner<br>in physics and Kath Wallace in<br>environmental economics um so I<br>appreciate that times have changed um<br>but there's still a way to go until the<br>propor represents the society we live in<br>um I want to start by talking about what<br>shaped me and my research<br>Direction so I was born in 1967 and the<br>post-war period that Marxist historian<br>Eric Hobs borne called the Golden Age<br>but by the time I was five we were out<br>of the golden age and into the crisis<br>decades and that's the world that I grew<br>up<br>in um so who remembers the<br>1980s yeah pretty much everyone here so<br>I started school in 1980 High School um<br>and while some of the music was good I<br>remember the 1980s as being pretty Grim<br>there was a global economic recession we<br>had Rising unemployment rates Rising<br>inflation mortgage rates reached 20% or<br>more and the backdrop to all of this was<br>the Cold War and this pervasive fear of<br>nuclear war most of the tension was in<br>the northern hemisphere but American<br>nuclear warships were visiting a harbors<br>and France was testing nuclear weapons<br>in the South Pacific in<br>1984 the bulletin of the atomic<br>scientists moved their Doomsday Clock<br>forward to 3 Minutes to Midnight the<br>closest it had been since<br>1953 then in 1985 French agents bombed<br>the Rainbow Warrior in<br>Oakland it was also an unashamedly<br>racist world uh South Africa was living<br>under apartheid and the springb tour of<br>1981 divided our nation<br>as part of her protest my Aunt Dina<br>who's here today founded an organization<br>called war or woman against rugby with a<br>Manifesto that included telling women<br>not to wash their sons and husbands<br>rugby<br>jerseys I marched with friends and<br>family and protest at the tour but my<br>grandmother went one step further and<br>was arrested for running onto the tarmac<br>at Wellington airport to disrupt a plane<br>that was carrying the springb plane<br>the next day's newspaper headline read<br>cell so as a teenager I was anxious and<br>confused and often angry while the<br>people around me were speaking out<br>against the things that were wrong about<br>the world it was clear that the people<br>in charge some of them on the screen<br>here were doing a crappy job of running<br>things and it was hard to have a<br>positive vision of the future I wonder<br>now so through the 1980s most of us<br>thought that nuclear war was a matter of<br>when rather than if at first we thought<br>that here and Al are far away from any<br>Northern Hemisphere conflict we would<br>survive but after our whole senior year<br>at high school got busted to the movies<br>to see the film the day after we<br>realized we wouldn't be okay we the<br>planet would fall into a nuclear winter<br>and if the radiation didn't get us we'd<br>be unable to grow food and we would all<br>starve I hope the young people are<br>feeling okay<br>here and and that was just one of the<br>movies or TV shows that had a real<br>impression on me there was also Sleeping<br>Dogs which my mother took me to see at<br>the movies when I was just 10 years old<br>thanks Mom and survivors a 1970s British<br>show which my mother watched on TV at<br>about the same time anyone else have the<br>urge to rewatch that during the First Co<br>lockdown so thanks to my husband<br>DVD so the way that my friend MZ and I<br>responded to the fears and anxieties of<br>the 1980s and our very liberal<br>Progressive upbringings was first of all<br>to listen to noisy punk music and stomp<br>around wearing boots and Army Surplus<br>Gear but then we completely pivoted to<br>become Born Again Christians which is<br>something I've written WR about in my<br>most recent book which like my lecture<br>is called end<br>times and retrospect it was a safe<br>refuge for us a way of adopting a<br>narrative that seemed to have the<br>answers to everything and it gave us a<br>community to belong to for a short time<br>anyway we lasted two years before we<br>recognized the anti-gay anti-woman<br>left so at University I did a BSC in<br>geology and then an honors year in<br>physical geography I loved learning to<br>read the rocks and the landscape and to<br>make a story out of it to explain how<br>things got to be the way they were um<br>but look how miserable I was that's me<br>trying to operate a mean aeter in a<br>field somewhere out in the W upper I was<br>interested interested in learning what<br>science told us about the world but not<br>really doing the science myself so I<br>left uni with a BC honors<br>and then maybe there was another Factor<br>at play my father was a professor one of<br>those old school professors with a te<br>tweet jacket with leather elbow Patches<br>he was a seismic engineer and he worked<br>in New Zealand Italy and the US and he<br>had started calling me Dr Priestley when<br>I was about 3 years<br>old and I think it's perhaps my<br>Rebellion against that parental<br>expectation that meant I took a long<br>time to come back to<br>Academia I had written for Salient as a<br>student had always wanted to be a writer<br>but I then spent a decade working in the<br>field now known as science communication<br>before I went to a career counselor who<br>talk me through a card sorting exercise<br>at the end of which there was one clear<br>career path academic this reminded me<br>that I had always intended to go back to<br>University to do a PhD I'd just never<br>been sure what<br>in so after lots of Googling I<br>discovered there was a discipline called<br>History of Science and after a chance<br>meeting with Rob goldblat who was a<br>family friend I learned that a postgrad<br>history and philosophy of science<br>program was starting up at the<br>University of<br>Canterbury so I started my history of<br>science PhD in 2001 looking at New<br>Zealand's nuclear history which I did<br>remotely and part-time while having<br>three children in the picture here two<br>of which are here tonight and writing<br>two books uh then got that academic<br>position here um initially fixed term in<br>2013 um so now as an interdisciplinary<br>researcher and writer with four degrees<br>in four different disciplines and half a<br>ba and another<br>discipline and they might seem desperate<br>but I I think they're all strongly<br>narrative<br>disciplines I do sometimes struggle to<br>Define what discipline I'm in or what<br>has informed the path that I've taken<br>but when I look back at at my academic<br>career from the start of my PhD to now<br>and the sorts of things that I've been<br>interested in studying it's pretty clear<br>to me that what I've been doing is<br>research so I'm going to break this talk<br>up to cover some of the things that over<br>the years have caused me a lot of<br>anxiety and have dictated my research<br>and writing<br>Focus um and I'm going to start by<br>talking about nuclear history<br>histories so what my generation knew<br>about New Zealand's nuclear history was<br>that we were nuclear free I'd marched<br>against visits from American nuclear<br>warships grown up with the threesh of<br>nuclear war was outraged at the bombing<br>of the Rainbow Warrior but after my<br>geology degree I did some contract work<br>for gns Science and part of this Crown<br>Research Institute was the former<br>Institute of nuclear Sciences an<br>organization set up in 19 58 as a branch<br>of the Department of scientific and<br>Industrial Research or<br>dsir it was on the hill above the<br>gracefield science campus and when I had<br>to get a taxi there from patony railway<br>station I learned that the taxi drivers<br>called it the bomb<br>Factory and this was weird and<br>fascinating and I learned that there was<br>a longer and not very well-known history<br>about New Zealand's nuclear past and<br>that's the story that my PhD thesis in<br>the subsequent book Maron radium told<br>this topic was super interesting to me<br>and it allowed me to delve into<br>something that I used to find really<br>scary so now I'll share a bit about New<br>history so New Zealand's early<br>involvement with the nuclear age came<br>because of what Ross Goldrath has called<br>The ruford<br>Connection so Ernest ruford had died in<br>1937 but come the start of the second<br>world war he was still a hugely<br>respected Nobel prize winning scientist<br>for his work on radiation and the atom<br>the head of New Zealand's DSR Ernest<br>masden had been a student of rutherfords<br>in the UK where he was involved in the<br>famous experiment from which Rutherford<br>deduced the structure of the<br>atom so come the second world war and<br>the very secret British and US plans to<br>build an atomic bomb maen was well<br>connected enough to find out what was<br>going on he organized a team of DSi<br>physicists to start making Gea Cs and in<br>late 1944 two teams of geologists and<br>physicists each with a portable Gea<br>counter began a secret exploration of<br>promising parts of the South Island from<br>fwell to Stuart Island they were looking<br>for Uranium which was suddenly a very<br>useful mineral and this was the first of<br>a series of uranium surveys including a<br>ship-based exploration of the West Coast<br>beaches and<br>fand mden also got a group of young New<br>Zealand physicists and Engineers<br>involved on the Manhattan Project to<br>build an atomic bomb and a parallel<br>project in Montreal Canada to build the<br>first nuclear power<br>plant in August 1945 following the<br>dropping of nuclear weapons on hoshima<br>and Nagasaki New Zealand newspaper<br>editorials expressed how proud they were<br>of the work our boys had done and the UK<br>congratulated New Zealand acknowledging<br>the foundations of this great<br>achievement came from Rutherford's own<br>work<br>a few months later New Zealand's atomic<br>energy Act was passed to give the state<br>full control over uranium and other<br>radioactive elements so there was a<br>general very positive attitude towards<br>both nuclear weapons they had ended the<br>war and nuclear power which promised a<br>cheap and bountiful supply of<br>populations the 1950s were marked by<br>excitement about the possibilities of<br>nuclear energy but also the beginning of<br>the nuclear arms race with the US Soviet<br>Union and the UK developing fishing<br>bombs and then the much more powerful<br>Fusion or hydrogen<br>bombs in New Zealand the UK atomic<br>energy Authority partnered with our<br>government on a project to harness the<br>energy of the Waki geothermal field to<br>produce electricity for local<br>consumption and heavy water for use in<br>the British nuclear program though the<br>heavy water P project was eventually<br>abandoned<br>the 1950s also saw the beginning of<br>civil defense in New Zealand and<br>preparedness for a nuclear attack was<br>top<br>priority a 1959 booklet civil defense in<br>New Zealand declared the most likely<br>targets to be Oakland Christ Church<br>denan and Wellington which you can see<br>in this map showing Fallout zones after<br>a bomb dropped on parli and we're not in<br>a very good spot right here yeah so<br>while EV ation of potential targets was<br>considered the civil defense priority<br>and a nuclear attack the booklet also<br>mentioned the need for Fallout shelters<br>of relatively simple types such as slit<br>trenches and Anderson type<br>frames which just reminds me of the<br>Raymond Brigg's book where the wind when<br>the wind blows where Jim blogs prepares<br>for a nuclear attack by making an<br>Anderson shelter in the living room out<br>of a door and some heavy cushions and I<br>think a generation of children were just<br>terrorized by this book when the wind<br>blows as a comic by the same author as<br>fungus the bogeyman it was very<br>appealing to pick up and open but it had<br>a very dark<br>story but on a more positive note kind<br>of in 1954 the New Zealand government<br>published a guide to prospecting for<br>radioactive<br>minerals hundreds of eager Prospectors b<br>or made their own Gea counters and began<br>exploring then one Sunday afternoon in<br>November 1955 these two veteran<br>Prospectors uh Fred kassen and Charles<br>Jacobson were returning home after a day<br>prospecting in the Hills above the B<br>Gorge as their Story Goes they had<br>finished the day with a few drinks in<br>the Berlin hotel and needing to relieve<br>themselves on the drive home pulled the<br>truck over to the side of the road next<br>to Betty<br>Creek Jacobson put his Geer counter on<br>the rock face and the counter ticked<br>wildly the needing needle going off the<br>scale he said the excited pair returned<br>to the hotel to spend the night<br>returning the next morning to gather<br>Rock<br>samples when they arrived in Wellington<br>armed with samples of the radioactive<br>Rock there was great excitement<br>especially when the Geological Survey<br>confirmed the rock contained twice as<br>much uranium as The Rock in The Rum<br>Jungle uranium mine in<br>Australia so for a brief time the West<br>Coast swelled in the grip of a uranium<br>Rush the hills and river valleys filled<br>with Prospectors eager for a find of the<br>a to fuel the developing United Kingdom<br>and United States nuclear program a<br>uranium strike was also a really<br>exciting prospect for New Zealand<br>because a local uranium Source would<br>make nuclear power all the more<br>affordable soon there were six reported<br>uranium finds and a new air of Hope and<br>prosperity on the west coast hotels made<br>presence of radioactive rock fragments<br>to passing guests and some entrepreneur<br>began selling uranium iced cream which<br>which did not contain any uranium um and<br>the Berlin Hotel had its busiest<br>afternoon trade since the Gold Rush<br>prospection continued through the 50s<br>but a enough highly concentrated uranium<br>and one place to make commercial<br>extraction of it viable was never<br>found 1958 saw the establishment of the<br>DSi Institute of nuclear sciences and<br>the start of a long but ultimately<br>unsuccessful campaign to set up a<br>nuclear reactor at the institute's site<br>at Grace field the place that<br>Factory the 1960s began with a Goodwill<br>visit of a nuclear submarine the USS hot<br>which Drew crowds not in protest but to<br>Marvel at the sleek and sophisticated<br>manifestation of the nuclear<br>age there had been excitement about the<br>possibility of nuclear power since it<br>began being used to generate electricity<br>in the UK and the 19 50s and by 1964 it<br>had made it on to New Zealand's nuclear<br>sorry New Zealand's power plan a local<br>Manpower committee sent Engineers to the<br>UK to train and nuclear engineering and<br>a sighting committee selected a site on<br>the Kyra Harbor is the best location to<br>serve the demand for electricity from<br>the growing population of<br>Oakland with renewed pressure on the<br>need for Uranium as fuel for the nuclear<br>power plant government funded uranium<br>prospecting Rec commenced<br>meanwhile atmospheric testing of nuclear<br>weapons was pumping radioactive elements<br>into the stratosphere from where they<br>were distributed around the world<br>eventually falling out to the<br>ground The Fallout products strontium 90<br>and cesm 137 for example each with a<br>halflife of about 30 years got into the<br>air to the soil from the soil to the<br>grass and the cows who ate the grass and<br>from the cow's milk into the bones of<br>the babies and children who drank the<br>milk strontium and cesium levels were<br>highest in<br>born the public moood turned in the<br>1970s with growing protests against<br>French nuclear testing um see there's<br>that classic line on one of the banners<br>there um we don't pee in the Atlantic so<br>don't shut up our Pacific and against<br>American nuclear warship visits when the<br>usss truckton visited Wellington in 1976<br>it was not only the protesters who got<br>into action following the civil defense<br>plan and preparation for an accident or<br>even a nuclear strike the national<br>radiation laboratory installed radiation<br>monitoring devices at 20 sites around<br>Wellington<br>Harbor the day before the ship arrived<br>the National civil defense nerve center<br>was activated under Parliament<br>buildings part of the requirement for<br>relaxed readiness<br>was having a stock of protective<br>clothing individual dosimeters<br>respirators and potassium iodine tablets<br>which could protect the thyroid gland<br>from radioactive iodine to administer in<br>case of a nuclear<br>incident 1978 marked the report of the<br>royal Commission of inquiry into nuclear<br>power generation in New Zealand there<br>was an urgent need for new electricity<br>generating options and the purpose of<br>the inquiry was to weigh up nuclear<br>power against different power generation<br>options but by the time they came to<br>report the Maui gas field had been<br>discovered and huntley's coal reserves<br>had been found to be bigger than<br>previously known there was now no need<br>for nuclear power and in the<br>commission's report they describe the<br>history of nuclear power in New Zealand<br>as one of official enthusiasm early<br>public acceptance or apathy and then of<br>rising opposition They concluded that<br>nuclear power is not justified for New<br>Zealand until about the tune of the<br>later meanwhile another threat was<br>looming atmospheric chemists first<br>suggested in 1982 that there was a<br>possibility of climate change induced by<br>nuclear war they calculated that the<br>fires that would burn for weeks after a<br>nuclear war would produce a thick layer<br>of smoke that would reduce the amount of<br>sunlight that would reach the Earth's<br>surface and totally eliminate<br>agricultural production in the northern<br>hemisphere a subsequent study the first<br>to use the phrase nuclear winter found<br>that a global nuclear war could lead to<br>subfreezing land temperatures in<br>Continental areas down to minus 25° C<br>for many months and as it would affect<br>the southern hemisphere as well as the<br>Northern Hemisphere this matter really<br>caught the attention of the New Zealand<br>media um there were also these fun books<br>to read New Zealand after nuclear war U<br>published in 1987 was a national case<br>study of the effects on new Ze land of a<br>large scale nuclear war in the S<br>Northern Hemisphere and this nuclear<br>survival manual um was grm really an<br>every man for himself kind of<br>survivalist Guide to Life after nuclear<br>war but what the 1980s are most well<br>known for is our nuclear free policy so<br>in 1985 the labor government's nuclear<br>free policy was put into action when<br>David Long's labor government refused<br>entry to a US warship that could neither<br>confirm or deny if it was carrying<br>nuclear weapons the US retaliated by<br>kicking New Zealand out of the ansis<br>agreement the Australia New Zealand and<br>US military<br>Alliance then French agents bombed the<br>Rainbow Warrior later that year labor<br>won the general election on a nuclear<br>free platform and in 1987 the New<br>Zealand nuclear free zone disarmament<br>passed so this this is a research<br>interest that started with my<br>PhD and and has continued on um with a<br>co-edited book about the impact of the<br>Fukushima nuclear disaster on attitudes<br>to nuclear power around the world and<br>then some um work I'm doing at the<br>moment for the white Tangi tribunal on<br>Mighty veterans exposure to radiation um<br>and this exposure came um from three<br>places um from operation Gra<br>where New Zealand sent two Navy ships to<br>provide weather information for the<br>British hbomb tests in 1957 and<br>58 um in Antarctica where the US<br>operated a nuclear power station at<br>McMurdo from 1962 to<br>1972 and on operation Pista which was<br>the 1973 protest Voyage of the hmnzs<br>otago and Canterbury who sailed to Moro<br>but at some time in my 20s the thing<br>that began eclipsing nuclear war as my<br>number one anxiety was climate change it<br>was in the third year of my Earth<br>Sciences degree when the<br>intergovernmental panel on climate<br>change or ipcc first met in<br>1988 I graduated in 1990 the same year<br>the ipcc released its first report<br>identifying climate CL change as one of<br>the most important long-term threats to<br>humanity in my geology classes I had<br>gained an understanding of the ways the<br>earth's climate had changed in response<br>to Natural phenomena in the past I'd<br>learned about contemporary climate<br>change in physical geography classes<br>with mik croia and in my honors here in<br>a course with Jim Salinger on<br>climatology and for a while climate<br>change felt like something that might<br>happen in the future<br>but we were going to do something to<br>stop it in 2010 when I finished my PhD I<br>started writing a regular science column<br>for The Listener magazine and I wrote a<br>lot about climate change and Antarctic<br>ice melt and the scientists who studied<br>these things many of them from our<br>Antarctic Research Center here and for a<br>while we really believed that if only<br>people understood what we knew about<br>climate change and what we needed to do<br>to turn things around then everything<br>I started my academic career here in<br>2013 and with ran sammon started a<br>teaching program we initially called<br>science in<br>context my PhD was in history of Science<br>and I started a history of science<br>course but there was a lot of interest<br>in my science communication background<br>and Brianne and I found ourselves<br>invited encouraged coer St into writing<br>papers about science communication<br>teaching a new course in science<br>communication<br>and working with Scientists on large<br>projects that wanted a science<br>communication or public engagement<br>component I went to a lot of conferences<br>that first year I guess trying to find<br>out where I fitted in with my strong<br>Science Background I didn't really fit<br>in history uh with my history background<br>I didn't really fit in science<br>communication and finally I went to an<br>SDS or science and technology studies<br>conference in<br>Singapore and a way they felt like my<br>people they were certainly concerned<br>about the same issues but a paper after<br>paper people were talking about Dera and<br>Fuko and things like Lial spaces and<br>Boundary objects in a way that made it<br>really clear that everyone should be<br>familiar with these Scholars and these<br>terms and I realized I had a completely<br>different<br>vocabulary the language of science where<br>spaces and objects were actual things in<br>the physical world and I felt more<br>comfortable with disciplines where<br>understanding the world started with<br>getting right out in the midst of things<br>usually in a pair of shorts and some<br>tramping boots I enjoy the laughs from<br>my colleagues there yeah so what I did<br>find over time is that to me the<br>discipline or methods that I use to<br>approach a topic is not what connects me<br>or interests me with others it's the<br>topic itself I'm much more interested in<br>meeting with people from other<br>disciplines who are all investigating<br>the same problem so for me that's<br>Antarctica or climate change or sea<br>level rise or mistrust in science the<br>conferences I get the most out of are<br>when I meet with Scientists social<br>scientists other Humanity Scholars<br>indigenous study Scholars artists<br>communicators all bringing our different<br>perspectives and tools and practices and<br>ideas to some nly<br>problems so I started presenting at<br>interdisciplinary conferences and<br>collaborating with colleagues from the<br>natural and social sciences on Journal<br>articles many of them with a focus on<br>climate change communication and some of<br>this work here is from the New Zealand<br>crise program that I was involved in for<br>5<br>years but what really attracted me to<br>the idea of being an academic was that<br>it would give me time to write<br>books I had been to antactica twice on a<br>media program in 2011 and with Cliff<br>Atkins to film lect for a new online<br>course about Antarctica in 2014 and I'd<br>written many magazine articles and blogs<br>about it but I had a lot more to say and<br>a much more personal story to tell so<br>during my first sabatical I enrolled in<br>a masters of creative writing at The<br>International Institute of modern<br>letters here at T hiding aaka and truly<br>that was the best educational experience<br>of my life and while my writing was very<br>personal I also followed the work of a<br>group of scientists who I spent time<br>with in Antarctica Nick gge Tim n and<br>Richard Levy I went to Antarctica again<br>with cliff in 2018 so the book 15<br>million years in Antarctica which has<br>been called an Ecom Memoir which I quite<br>liked uh covers these Street traps and<br>sometimes in<br>between and it was in this book that I<br>got honest about the anxiety that has<br>permeated much of my life that was<br>sometimes about something specific like<br>climate change or flying in a helicopter<br>to a remote Antarctic field camp but was<br>really just there much of the<br>time um and so I'm I'm going to just<br>read a little passage from end times oh<br>sorry from 15 millenni in<br>Antarctica um and this reading is from a<br>chapter focused on the 2014 trip and<br>we're in a remote field camp in a place<br>called free Hills and the trans antartic<br>mountains<br>the guys are still planning the next<br>day's field work but I need to be on my<br>own so I say my good nights and head for<br>my tent through the bright white of the<br>blowing<br>snow the surface beneath the snow is<br>Dusty and brown and every time I go into<br>my tent I track in a bit of 14 million<br>year old dirt mixed with fresh snow<br>getting in and out of the tent which has<br>a fly sheet over the top is a mission<br>because of the cold I'm I'm wearing my<br>ECW boots and I need to take them off<br>before crawling<br>inside it's a oneperson tent and inside<br>is my three layer sleeping bag a down<br>bag inside a synthetic bag inside a<br>canvas bag on top of my foam and sheep<br>skin sleeping mats beside the bed my<br>clothes and books are spilling out of a<br>large stuffed bag my pea bottle is on<br>one corner of the tent and my drink<br>bottle is in another not to sou do not<br>mix them up I'm a messy traveler and my<br>tendency to to fling things from one end<br>of the tent to the other is not good<br>here it's the mixture of dust from<br>outside and moisture from melting snow<br>is making things Mucky I wasn't<br>expecting dirt in<br>Antarctica I strip off everything except<br>my thermals socks hat and neck Gator and<br>get as deep into my bags as I can<br>despite the time it's after 9:00 p.m.<br>and the falling snow it's light The Sun<br>Won't Set here for another 3 months and<br>there's a gentle orange glow inside my<br>tent it's cozy and I usually cherish<br>alone time but I'm having trouble<br>breathing and I'm starting to<br>panic on my own in the tent without any<br>chatter around me I acknowledge to<br>myself that I really don't feel good my<br>head is buzzing my chest feels tight and<br>breathe so the covid-19 pandemic made a<br>lot of people very anxious but while the<br>pandemic itself was a source of anxiety<br>for me I felt very calm during our<br>lockdowns I was in the privileged<br>position of having a salary and a house<br>with a Garden close to the beach in the<br>bush and a dog to walk so enough space<br>for our family of five to feel<br>comfortable in a genuine crisis people<br>with chronic anxiety can sometimes<br>perform quite<br>well in some way I felt that at last the<br>bad thing had happened<br>and I was prepared of course I had been<br>hypervigilant early in 2020 I was<br>tracking the international news reading<br>what colleagues who worked on modeling<br>epidemiology microbiology were saying on<br>social media and<br>preparing I slowly and quietly started<br>stocking up on food that is not toilet<br>paper and our team already did a lot of<br>online teaching so we had a relatively<br>easy pivot to working from home and<br>teaching online when jenda Ur announced<br>the lockdown I felt a surge of relief it<br>was the right thing to do and it showed<br>that we could make massive changes at<br>speed if needed and so I wrote about the<br>pandemic and climate change and our<br>responses to both in an essay for<br>granter um for an EP for an addition<br>called um second<br>nature and as part of my intense focus<br>on the pandemic I watched the daily 1pm<br>briefings during lockdown and later<br>works with a colleague Alex Bey as part<br>of a wider Taha mattini project to<br>analyze the language used in the<br>briefings which we described as<br>featuring open honest and<br>straightforward<br>communication distinctive and<br>motivational language with military<br>analogies and references and sporting<br>analogies and references and expressions<br>of care and even though it's only three<br>years old this is now my most cited<br>paper thank you<br>Alex in 68 citations in three years<br>that's a good number for the Humanities<br>to the scientists out there who might<br>not be so<br>impressed um and I also collaborated on<br>this paper with Susie ws and Toby Morris<br>to document and contextualize their work<br>making cartoons for the spin-off during<br>the<br>pandemic but the pandemic brought new<br>anxieties in 2017 at<br>a Richard Arnold and I had proposed a<br>research project which started with the<br>question how did things get so bad and<br>led to a project with the Bland title of<br>science statistics and the media in<br>which we would look quite broadly at<br>trust and Science in Alo with a focus on<br>science communicated through news and<br>social<br>media things got worse and by the time<br>the funding came through and we were<br>ready to start the<br>project it was it was 2021 we decided<br>not not focus on the pandemic and the<br>associated infodemic because things had<br>got so heated and there were so many<br>other people working on this by now but<br>it was relevant context to what we were<br>doing during the first years of the<br>pandemic While most of us were happy to<br>follow our prime minister's advice to be<br>kind and get vaccinated there were<br>others who didn't just oppose vaccine<br>mandates and mask mandates they doubted<br>the reality of the co pandemic itself<br>there were some wild conspiracy theories<br>around including claims that the vaccine<br>caused programmed cell death and was<br>associated with nefarious Plans by<br>global Elite for a new world order or<br>the One World Government which instead<br>of sounding cooky sounded strangely<br>familiar to me and I started thinking<br>about the 1980s and the two years that I<br>spent as a born- again Christian and I<br>realized I still had my teenage diaries<br>from that period And I wondered if I<br>might be brave enough to read them to<br>see of what I've been thinking and<br>writing about and using it as the basis<br>for a piece of writing might help me<br>make sense of the way that things were<br>now and maybe empathized with people<br>saying things that as someone trained in<br>science and who' spent years as a<br>science writer made no sense to<br>me then from my next sabatical I took a<br>road trip down the West Coast with my<br>best friend M with whom i' shared this<br>Christian<br>experience along the way I talked to<br>locals I've been writing about science<br>for more than two decades I talked to<br>scientists about climate change<br>biodiversity loss natural hazards and<br>shared what they said with<br>readers on this West Coast trip I was<br>reading Rebecca sonnet's Book Men<br>explain things to me which is a<br>collection of essays and I was thinking<br>about my work as a science writer and<br>thought that title mean explain things<br>to me pretty much summed up my career so<br>far and so I wanted to do something<br>different rather than listen to<br>authoritative accounts I wanted to hear<br>from people who weren't scientists who<br>weren't the acknowledged experts about<br>the things that worried me climate<br>change the pandemic earthquakes and I<br>would listen to them respectfully and<br>write it<br>down and behind all this I was thinking<br>about how polarized things said God in<br>our society and how important it is that<br>we step outside our usual circles reach<br>out to other people and be prepared to<br>listen to each other and more often than<br>not underneath what what might sometimes<br>feel like irreconcilable differences<br>will'll find some common values or<br>concerns a bit of sheared<br>humanity so I took a tour of the Stockon<br>coal mine I interviewed the climate<br>change Deni M of Westland I talked to<br>people who worried about climate change<br>but did not trust the covid vaccine and<br>I wrote about<br>it when I told my children I was writing<br>another book they asked me if I was<br>going to write a real book this time<br>that would be a novel but no know this<br>was another work of creative<br>non-fiction so in this book end times I<br>alternated chapters of the teenage story<br>with the West Coast story and made<br>connections between the two narratives<br>and beneath both narratives the books<br>about friendship and belonging and PAB<br>family history and community and trying<br>to tease out why people believe what<br>they believe why some people might<br>accept the scientific consensus on<br>things like climate change or the<br>covid-19 te pandemic and some people<br>frame these things in a totally<br>different way and want to rely only on<br>their own personal experience and<br>observation and tend not to trust<br>anything a scientist or a science writer<br>might tell<br>them Richard and I have also been<br>supervising two students uh Zoe Brown<br>has completed a masters looking at<br>attitudes to climate change in a<br>Canterbury farming community and April<br>Boland is doing a PhD focused on Flat<br>so I'm genuine when I say that anxiety<br>has shaped my research it's not just a<br>gimmick to hold this lecture together um<br>today the Doomsday Clock is at 90<br>Seconds To Midnight we're in a time of<br>deep instability and uncertainty about<br>the<br>future you could say that with a career<br>focused on<br>thinking and writing about nuclear war<br>climate change pandemics and other<br>Horrors it's no wonder that I I have had<br>issues with<br>anxiety but my anxiety has been there<br>since I was a child I've always had this<br>sort of quiet hyper vigilance that makes<br>it very hard to<br>relax um but now despite all this my<br>day-to-day anxiety has reduced or it's<br>more under control and I just wanted to<br>say a little bit about why that is um<br>it's not because things are better in<br>the world but a year or so ago I was<br>diagnosed with autism what used to be<br>called Asperger syndrome and ADHD an<br>attentive um subtype not the um sort of<br>hyperactive impulsive subtype that you<br>might be more familiar with and I don't<br>want to make a huge deal of this but I<br>do want to share it to do what I do do<br>what I can to destigmatize these neurod<br>diversities um to help challenge<br>stereotypes about what these conditions<br>mean or look like um like many women in<br>my age I learned about neurodiversity<br>from doing lots of online quizzes that<br>told me I was probably neurodiverse<br>and from having children go through<br>diagnosis and recognizing that I had a<br>lot of the same symptoms or<br>challenges um getting these diagnosis<br>gave me a new framing um for my<br>responses to a lot of things that I<br>found difficult and blamed on what I<br>called my shyness introversion<br>anxiety and with this diagnosis my base<br>level of anxiety just halfed<br>overnight rather than thinking I needed<br>to take medication or to work on myself<br>to deal with my anxiety I recognized my<br>limits and understood that in some ways<br>my brain was just a bit different to<br>most people and um some social<br>situations or interactions were always<br>just going to be a bit harder for me um<br>I've also chosen to take stimulant<br>medication for my ADHD and that's<br>further reduced my anxiety and while<br>I've always been very productive in my<br>work life um maybe trying to<br>overcompensate for worrying that I<br>wasn't doing it right um I think that<br>made ation has helped me be more present<br>and calm in my home and personal life<br>and a bit tidier and less inclined to<br>lose things which is good um so just<br>while I have this platform I'll expose a<br>few myths about<br>autism um only autistic people are on<br>the autism spectrum um it's not true<br>that if you have autism you lack empathy<br>uh some of us us have a sort of<br>hyperempathy um including for animals<br>and objects which can be quite<br>exhausting um autistic children grow up<br>to be autistic<br>adults um and yeah unfortunately I'm not<br>a mathematical genius um but autistic<br>people and and those with ADHD can have<br>an ability to hyperfocus on things they<br>are really interested in and for me<br>that's not maths though I do like maths<br>um it's researching and writing books<br>essays articles about things that I want<br>to know more about and if there are no<br>other demands on me I'm happy to work at<br>16 our day I'm something I<br>enjoy so if my anxiety has driven my<br>research and my neurodiversity has<br>driven my anxiety it's really my<br>neurodiversity that is responsible for<br>the direction that my research has taken<br>and I tried to visualize how writing has<br>been so important to me writing has<br>always made me calm it really feels like<br>it's something I need to do to get<br>things out of my brain by putting my<br>thoughts feelings experience aners<br>learnings on the page and then shaping<br>it into a narrative it feels as though<br>that is done and there is now space in<br>my brain for other<br>things um and I'll just add that I've<br>put a lot of preparation into this talk<br>but it's easier for me to stand up here<br>and talk a situation where I know the<br>parameters and the rules and the format<br>um than it will be for me to be part of<br>the social function afterwards but but<br>I'm really pleased to see you all here<br>and I know most of you I think and yeah<br>please join us for Refreshments after<br>the<br>lecture um so where are we today I<br>wonder what Eric hogbo would call the<br>current age the one that probably began<br>about<br>2016 because we are very much not on the<br>right track if we want a fair peaceful<br>and sustainable future for our planet<br>and the species that live on and in<br>it my next book will be about the<br>Antarctic I sheet but I wonder if<br>there's something more useful for me to<br>do I'm 56 I think um so perhaps in the<br>next decade or so of Academia rather<br>than just letting my anxieties drive me<br>I'd like to think about what can I do to<br>be most useful not just to the<br>university but to the society that I'm<br>part of and more importantly to the<br>Future um but instead of ending on a<br>reflective Downer I want to end with<br>something a bit more peaceful and common<br>um and being in nature and spending time<br>with other people is something that we<br>know is good for all of us so I'm just<br>going to do a short reading to end uh<br>from end times um and this is from the<br>2021 narrative um it's about 10:00 at<br>night MZ and I have been staying in a<br>hostel in hka at the location of what<br>used to be called the cew insane asylum<br>it's pitch dark and Ma I've accepted an<br>locals we start walking Upstream<br>stepping carefully on rocks to avoid<br>immersing our boots in the water and<br>dodging low hanging branches of mar and<br>ponga when Zeus starts barking and<br>running in circles I ask what he's found<br>it's the fresh what a cray he thinks he<br>can catch them don't your boy says Aiden<br>hold on he says and bends down and<br>Fishes around in the water he lifts his<br>arm his sleeve dripping wet and holds<br>his hand out to us M shines her torch on<br>a Crawley it's like a tiny crayfish<br>maybe 10 cm long a murky greeny brown<br>color it's squirming in Aiden's grip put<br>it back I say feeling concerned for the<br>Crawley Aiden slides it back into the<br>river then points to a movement in the<br>water a cave weter he says they can trap<br>a bubble of air and take it with them<br>underwater sounds like you've been doing<br>some research says Jason<br>I wonder about his inflection of the<br>word research like it's a bad thing<br>something to be embarrassed or ashamed<br>of I'm pleased don't introduce myself as<br>a writer rather than a researcher or an<br>academic not research observation says<br>Aiden I've seen it I hold back on saying<br>that observation rather than reading<br>things on the Internet is the basis of<br>most scientific research now doesn't<br>seem the time for a philosophical<br>discussion on the nature of science it's<br>dark and it's cold I have no idea where<br>the we<br>are while Jason stops to roll a durry MZ<br>and I carry on up the stream following<br>the torch light and the sweet smell of<br>Aiden's caramel flavored<br>Vape M just ahead of me flicks past a<br>branch that swings back and hits me<br>across the bridge of my nose ow<br> she says sorry there's a bit of<br>blood but I'm okay I hold my hand over<br>my nose and look around on the banks<br>either side of us are remnants of the<br>old dump an Institutional chair a bottle<br>perched on a metal lawn mower God knows<br>what's buried beneath the dirt and the<br>leaf<br>litter Jason who has caught up with us<br>starts talking about overburden rounded<br>rocks gold mining he now works as a moss<br>cutter Gathering spum Moss but did a<br>stunt with an uial gold mining operation<br>he seems to know what he's talking about<br>Mez used to be a mining engineer at<br>offer wondering if she's going to join<br>the conversation but no one<br>responds perhaps they don't believe me<br>where are we going we continue up the<br>Stony stream but now the cliffs either<br>side of us are vertical covered with<br>dripping Ferns and mosses at the top of<br>the cliffs May before Mees High trees<br>reach out over the stream covering most<br>of the sky through the gaps we can see<br>stars we're commenting on what an<br>amazing place this is and asking Aiden<br>how he found it but we're thinking when<br>will this ever end are we just walking<br>or are we going somewhere a sub Anan<br>cabin padded<br>cell Jason who is now walking ahead of<br>me holds a branch back for me and I<br>decide that St close to him might be our<br>best chance of survival he seems capable<br>and trustworthy chainsaw in one hand<br>beer in the<br>other we're here says Aiden finally<br>we're at the end of the stream ahead of<br>us is an ancient looking stone wall<br>where water falls from a pipe and pulls<br>in a pond just a few meters across we<br>turn off our torches and on the moss<br>covered vertical walls around us<br>thousands of pin Pricks of light emerge<br>constellations of<br>stars we are surrounded by gloworms more<br>than I've ever seen 10 times more than<br>I've ever seen like we're floating<br>through<br>space We Stand head steped back turning<br>in slow circles exclaiming while Aiden<br>Vapes I fill my lungs with the earthy<br>damp hair the chuckle of the water and<br>the bright white stars against the Black<br>Knight transporting me into a world<br>where once deeply grounded and floating<br>in<br>space I feel a connection with the river<br>the people I'm with the planet I'm on<br>and give thanks for this moment this<br>place that's why I do this kind of<br>I remind myself it's almost always worth<br>following a trail saying yes to an<br>adventure for what you might find at the<br>end and people are mostly good and kind<br>and fun I'm starting to miss this<br>feeling even before it's<br>gone Jason took on his torch and We<br>Gather close to the cliff to look at the<br>sticky silk threads hanging from the<br>walls the gloworms attract insects prey<br>with their lights then trap them in<br>their snares when an insect lands on<br>them they pull the snare up and eat the<br>insect they thrive in caves grottos and<br>deep gys protected from the wind where<br>their snares can hang without getting<br>blown about and<br>Tangled you know they're not actually<br>worms don't you says Jason we do know<br>but it feels less special when you know<br>they're maggots<br>the laa of a fungus snatch the Latin<br>name is arachnocampa<br>luminosa the mai name is titty meaning<br>lights reflected in<br>water Koto thank you for coming<br>this is an enormous privilege for me so<br>thank<br>you I'm Professor Niki Nelson and the<br>dean of the faculty of Science and I am<br>just delighted to be able to do this<br>thank you this vote of thanks to<br>Professor Rebecca Presley for her<br>wonderful inaugural lecture doesn't seem<br>quite the words to to cover it Rebecca<br>I'd like to acknowledge the vice<br>Chancellor the university leadership at<br>this event I'd like to welcome Rebecca's<br>family and friends it's a pleasure to<br>have you joining us today I know it's<br>one of the really uh unique things about<br>these inor lectures that make them so<br>special um we all know how valuable it<br>is to have this enormous support network<br>that we have as academics and I<br>especially want to acknowledge Rebecca's<br>husband Jonathan and her children all of<br>them not just the ones that are here<br>puppy Hazel and Huck and as for the rest<br>of the audience thank you so much for<br>coming out to support your colleague<br>friend or person you're super interested<br>in your<br>work and tonight we've been honored to<br>hear Rebecca examine issues such as New<br>Zealand's nuclear history climate change<br>communication and trust and<br>science we live in a time where while<br>the public have engaged strongly in<br>science scientific research trust in<br>science has been eroded calling us to<br>question and reflect how we have<br>communicated how we'll continue to<br>communicate about scientific<br>issues as researchers the topics we're<br>passionate about can keep us up at night<br>but Rebecca's lecture highlights the<br>importance of facing these issues hit on<br>personally learning about them and<br>educating others and response to times<br>of Crisis and anxiety and I would<br>suggest perhaps even a solution to<br>anxiety as the vice Chancellor noted in<br>his introduction Rebecca is a valued<br>colleague of ours in the faculty of<br>Science and in the foundation of the<br>School of Science and<br>Society she's an enthusiastic and<br>generous researcher and<br>teacher she's excelled and creating a<br>really supportive and inclusive learning<br>community her passion for science The<br>History of<br>Science it's evident not only in her<br>widely published books but essays<br>articles blogs her<br>leadership and notably as a driver for<br>the evolution of this new school that we<br>Society Rebecca's ability to think<br>creatively and strategically when<br>solving problems and facing new ideas is<br>truly inspiring<br>we're really lucky to have you as a<br>member of our staff<br>here so before you clap I would like us<br>to say congratulations to Rebecca on a<br>fantastic inaugural lecture we're really<br>proud of you and I want to welcome you<br>all to join us in uh um little something<br>outside which you've already indicated<br>you'll be really happy to talk to us at<br>um we're really proud of you and all the<br>extent outstanding work you've done so<br>far and we look forward to what the next</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
