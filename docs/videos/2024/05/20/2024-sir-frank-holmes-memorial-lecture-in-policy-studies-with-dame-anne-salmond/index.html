guess I ought to feel at<br>home here in the shadow of parliament<br>because as they say in politics it's<br>Doggy Dog whereas an Academia it's<br>precisely the<br>reverse but anyway it's a good recipe<br>for humility and in this lecture in<br>honor of Sir Frank with his exceptional<br>contributions both Academia and<br>politics I'd like to offer some thoughts<br>which are well researched I<br>hope it's not a matter of laying down<br>the law but exploring ideas about some<br>matters of national<br>importance so in 1992 during the Moody<br>Fen land claim the white Tangy tribunal<br>asked me to give evidence of mar<br>understandings of Tangi when it was<br>signed in<br>1840 I trained as a historical Ling<br>and had recently published Two Worlds uh<br>the first meetings between Mari and<br>Europeans a book that explored the<br>beginnings of our shared history in<br>altero New<br>Zealand of course I didn't want to<br>tackle that task on my own so I worked<br>very<br>closely with um M by penfold who you can<br>see here um on the far right I guess as<br>you're looking and CLE bow just behind<br>her friends and colleagues in my studies<br>at the University of<br>Oakland cleave was a fluent native<br>speaker of Northern<br>Marty and he had just written a book on<br>TI and M medy was also a fluent native<br>speaker from T to ta too but she had she<br>was also a brilliant translator of<br>Terell into<br>English so many b c and I worked through<br>the text of t word by<br>word drawing on their deep<br>understandings of TI and<br>Cave's database of early Marty<br>manuscripts and my own work on the<br>historical records including the debates<br>at each of the sites where tetti was<br>signed in the<br>north one of the first things that we<br>noticed was the use of the term tuku to<br>give or to<br>release uh throughout the text of TTI<br>and you'll see it in Blue on the screen<br>as I put up the text a term that was<br>used in chiefly gift exchange<br>so in the debates over<br>TTI each spoke for their own<br>Hau weighing up the risks and benefits<br>of forging a closer relationship with<br>Queen<br>Victoria Governor Hobson and the<br>British some Drew on Direct experience<br>of visits by themselves or the<br>predecessors to British colonies or to<br>Britain where they'd met Governors and<br>monarchs While others had studied the<br>Bible and learned about Governors or car<br>in that<br>context so for the Queen's<br>part T begins with a statement of<br>care in her<br>Mahar her caring concern for the r and<br>the Hau of New Zealand it says the queen<br>has decided to tuu or<br>give as<br>a a literally somebody that makes things<br>balanced even a mediator may be to<br>preserve their ra Tong and their land to<br>bring peace and tranquil living and to<br>avoid the evils arising from indigenous<br>persons ler case and seters living<br>without<br>law and in the debates over TTI at<br>whitei and elsewhere the argued over<br>whether or not to accept Governor hson<br>as a governor and what that might mean<br>for their people and their m is<br>R since the first arrival of Europeans<br>in ta too the in Hau fighting had<br>accelerated through uneven musket access<br>to muskets the missionaries were<br>challenging tapu and other tikanga<br>unruly settlers from Britain and<br>elsewhere were very difficult to control<br>and pressure from land speculators was<br>accelerating life in 1840 in ta too was<br>changing at a furious pace and for Thea<br>leadership was increasingly<br>fraud from their speeches they weren't<br>certain about what signing TTI might<br>mean eventually however almost all were<br>persuaded by the missionaries by Hobson<br>and by various<br>fellow fellow to put their trust in the<br>Queen's promises that they and Hobson<br>footing that their mner their lands and<br>their Tia would be protected and that it<br>was in their best interest to sign<br>TTI pivotal to these debates was the<br>balance between K in T1 or first article<br>in after a forensic analysis of these<br>terms in many different early documents<br>of Mari including the Bible to K tapu<br>andap the Declaration of dependence like<br>many scholars before us many m c and I<br>concluded that in their one banga took<br>or gave to Queen Victoria absolutely and<br>forever the right to have a governor in<br>New Zealand and to<br>govern this was a substantive gift but<br>less than the session of sovereignty in<br>the sense of an indivisible overarching<br>power claimed in the English draft of<br>the<br>treaty Henry Williams<br>the British missionary who translated<br>the English draft into Tel had<br>translated heut five years earlier the<br>Declaration of<br>Independence and in<br>he he used the words Kinga and Mana to<br>translate Sovereign power and authority<br>so King King kingship literally the the<br>powers of a king or a monarch and Mona<br>to translate Sovereign power and<br>authority while k was used to describe a<br>function of government it was used as a<br>translation equivalent for that a lesser<br>power it said that the might decide to<br>seed to somebody a person of their own<br>choosing the word r was used as a<br>Independence so Williams had lived in<br>the north by then 17 years and he knew<br>it was pointless to ask local R to seed<br>the r t<br>and he just come back from Port<br>Nicholson from here where he' seen the<br>Tory arrive and it was buying land all<br>over the place moving<br>around and talked to the L about how<br>they felt about what was going on there<br>was a war that had broken out partly<br>because of those<br>transactions and he was fearful about<br>what this might mean for local King<br>groups I think for that reason perhaps<br>he softened his translation of the<br>English draft of the treaty to make<br>acceptable to<br>the instead of using man and K to<br>translate sovereignty as he' done in<br>he he used K or governance instead which<br>had been spe specifically spelled out as<br>a lesser power in<br>Heap so in 1992 when we gave this<br>evidence to the tribunal that<br>in and the hu had not seeded sovereignty<br>in that sense of overarching invisible<br>power to the British the timing was<br>awkward and our report was quietly<br>sheld it wasn't until<br>2009 uh when the papari claim from the<br>north uh was mounted that the tribunal<br>finally tackled this very thorny issue<br>of sovereignty and its relationship with<br>TTI and<br>tin and I was asked for that tribunal to<br>revisit the earlier<br>evidence by that time CLE died and midy<br>medy wasn't well so with guidance from<br>close colleagues and friends including H<br>Sadler<br>Manuka um I carried out further research<br>and together uh that upheld those<br>earlier<br>findings we went through a lot more<br>evidence and and this time too there was<br>evidence that was given by Hau experts<br>greatly enriched our understandings of<br>that original text of per<br>perang and the context in which it was<br>signed in its stage one report the<br>tribunal itself concluded in an 800 page<br>magnum opus that when they signed TTI<br>the r did not seed sovereignty to the<br>queen but they did give her absolutely<br>and forever the right to govern in their<br>lands the interesting thing is that in<br>both of these hearings there wasn't much<br>attention given to today 3 The Third<br>Article which was assumed to be a fairly<br>accurate translation of the English<br>draft which reads Her Majesty the Queen<br>of England extends to the natives of New<br>Zealand her royal protection and imparts<br>to them all the rights and privileges of<br>British<br>subjects but when we came to look at<br>that a bit more closely 23 actually puts<br>it a bit<br>differently if you read it<br>Mar here in exchange for the agreement<br>to K so this gift exchange is happening<br>in this third Clause the queen promises<br>to care<br>for so it's<br>UMI lower case that meant in those years<br>it wasn't a description for a group of<br>people so much as normal everyday<br>indigenous local<br>maybe and<br>them exactly equivalent that term again<br>the<br>governor to his subjects exactly<br>subjects the inhabitants of England so<br>this was her return gift for the gift of<br>K and that's sort of How It's phrased in<br>the text<br>there are a couple of other things to<br>notice about t<br>3 while in the English there's just one<br>definite article the in Mari and there's<br>two and singular and<br>plural so when the queen promised to<br>give the indigenous inhabitants of New<br>Zealand TI or right ways of doing things<br>exactly equivalent to those of his<br>subjects the inhabitants of England that<br>gift was made to them as persons in the<br>plural although that<br>phrase has often been read as the Marti<br>people or the Marti race in the land's<br>case of<br>1987 uh that's a translation error that<br>comes out of this odd grammatical<br>difference this insensible slip from PL<br>plural to singular has contributed to<br>the interpretation of t as a binary<br>partnership between races or between the<br>Mari race and the crown or Mari and paga<br>in the land's case<br>judgments so the small grammatical<br>difference between Terell and English<br>has contributed I think to some<br>constitutional<br>confusion so when you read tari<br>throughout the text the parties of the<br>agreement are listed from the first line<br>of the Preamble onwards as Queen<br>Victoria Victoria the Queen of England<br>the carer or the governor as a someone<br>who makes things equivalent the<br>themselves<br>theu andang in the plural whether<br>they're talking about Nang Mari the<br>indigenous persons or Eng the people<br>from<br>England and Hau are the largest<br>collectivities<br>mentioned in 2 three furthermore when<br>the queen gives to Mario the indigenous<br>persons that absolutely equivalent to<br>those of her subjects<br>not the inhabitants of England this<br>isn't a relationship of equality and<br>equivalence not one of<br>same with the governor sends a clay<br>fakar one who creates this kind of<br>relationships so it's really important<br>to understand the and today three<br>means equivalent not the same not the<br>same as some people argue these<br>days equality and<br>difference as Toman said in one of the<br>last speeches of white tongy in 1840s<br>speaking in favor of the governor you<br>must be our father our Mata actually is<br>not really father it's senior<br>relative you must not allow us to become<br>slaves you must preserve our customs our<br>TI it must have been and never permit<br>our lands to be rested from<br>us and then<br>when n's elder brother pan spoke at<br>White Tony he was the last of the maniri<br>to speak on that occasion Bishop pomalo<br>reported that he spoke quote at length<br>in favor of Mr Hobson and explained by<br>bringing his two index bers side by side<br>that they would be perfectly equal and<br>that each Chief would be similarly equal<br>with Mr<br>Hobson so according to this reading of<br>tetti when each R signed the parchment<br>they forged their own alliance with<br>Queen<br>Victoria and in the northern Wars that<br>followed 5 years later when the treaty<br>promises were broken song and hapu<br>fought with the crown and others fought<br>against them in effect they each had the<br>right to set their own foreign po y you<br>might<br>say and the same thing happened in the<br>land wars in the 1860s as I guess we all<br>know so rather than a bilateral<br>partnership between the Mari race and<br>the crown FTI is a multilateral set of<br>alliances in which each and gave K the<br>right to govern her to Queen Victoria<br>while retaining<br>their their independent right to manage<br>their lands their ancestral measures and<br>relationships with the<br>crown at the same time the indigenous<br>inhabitants of New Zealand with their te<br>were placed on an equal footing as<br>persons with the inhabitants of England<br>and in this<br>respected is this compatible with<br>democracy I would say so absolutely for<br>a number of reasons so let me just kind<br>of share these thoughts with you<br>because in 1840 life in diadi was in<br>many ways more democratic than it was at<br>the same time for example in<br>Britain as Frederick Manning an early<br>settler in the HW observed quot the<br>natives are self so self-possessed<br>opinionated and Republican that the<br>Chiefs have at ordinary times but little<br>control over them except in very rare<br>cases where the chief happens to possess<br>a singular Vigor of character to enable<br>him to keep them under or<br>a distinguished judge of the land Court<br>Francis Dart Penton no system of<br>government that the world ever saw can<br>be more democratic than that of the<br>Marty the chief alone has no power the<br>whole tribe deliberate on every subject<br>not only politically on such as are of<br>public interest but even judicially they<br>hold their committees on every private<br>FAL no individual enjoys influence or<br>exercises power unless it originates<br>with the mass and is ly or t tacitly<br>conferred by them and this surprised a<br>lot of early Europeans who had come from<br>Britain so at a time when European<br>married women did not enjoy property<br>rights or the vote Mighty women<br>inherited land from their parents and<br>grandparents and FAL and TOA exercise<br>considerable<br>influence contrary to contemporary once<br>were warriors myths to European<br>eyewitnesses universally reported that<br>family life in Marty communities was<br>generally<br>cherished oh Samuel Mar's vanished what<br>happened to him<br>okay I quote Samuel maren Samuel maren<br>of course visited New Zealand for the<br>first time in 1814 and came back many<br>times and he wrote I saw no quarreling<br>while I was there they're kind to their<br>women and children I never observed<br>either with a mark of violence upon them<br>nor did I ever see a child strick and<br>anyone that knows about Samuel MDA no<br>one would describe him as a bleeding<br>heart and in 1840 the Traer Joel poac<br>wrote It's not uncommon this is amazing<br>to you know having spent a lot of time<br>on what I it's not uncommon to see young<br>children of Tender Years sitting next to<br>their parents and the councils<br>Apparently listening with the greatest<br>ofn attention they asked questions and<br>the Chiefs answered them with an air of<br>respect as if they were a corresponding<br>age to themselves I do not remember a<br>request of an infant being treated with<br>neglect or a demand from one of them<br>being<br>slighted and at the same time in the<br>United Kingdom if you read the social<br>histories as I've done at Great length<br>in in that same period discipline<br>through the criminal code as we all know<br>but also in everyday life was harsh and<br>often<br>violent under the doctrine of cover<br>coverture in which women and children<br>were legally covered um by their<br>husbands and<br>fathers<br>uh those the husbands and fathers were<br>entitled and indeed in many ways sort of<br>expected to use corporal punishment as a<br>form of discipline and married women had<br>no independent property<br>rights the king or queen was the head of<br>state and governance was shared between<br>the House of Lords or the upper house<br>and the House of Commons so it was<br>hierarchical in that sense as well at<br>that time the franchise was limited to<br>men and only men with a certain amount<br>of property so in 1833 in England and<br>Wales for example only about 17 men who<br>lived in cities and<br>towns um and4 men in rural areas had the<br>vote while in Ireland it was about 1 126<br>Urban men and only about one in 114<br>rural dwellers who were men had the<br>vote and in Ireland and Highland<br>Scotland I've been studying the history<br>of the Highlands quite intensively<br>recently Imperial rule was<br>brutal so in the islands and Highlands<br>the Western islands and Highlands the<br>GIC language and culture was prohibited<br>as one of the quot chief and principal<br>cause causes of barbarity and<br>incivility and resist were smashed in<br>battles such as<br>padin all days of<br>discipline after which lands were<br>confiscated and unbelievably actually<br>their leaders were hung drawn and<br>caughted this all surprised me when I<br>Learned was studying and this was<br>followed by the Highland clearances as<br>many of us will know the stories of our<br>own ancestors and my own fourbears who<br>were formerly Shaak were keepers of<br>traditional law for the kings of<br>Scotland and the Lords of the Isles were<br>driven from their ancestral lands into<br>Exile so for all of these reasons<br>article 3 T article three in the English<br>draft of the treaty in which the Queen<br>of England gave the indigenous<br>inhabitants all the rights and<br>privileges of British<br>subjects it wasn't it wasn't entirely a<br>gift because under English rule like the<br>Highland Scots my own ancestors and the<br>Irish H Mari especially women lost many<br>of their ancestral<br>freedoms and any idea that the treaty<br>introduced modern democracy to New<br>mistaken so when the first election was<br>held in New Zealand in 18453 for example<br>only men of course as we know had the<br>right to vote they had to be British<br>citizens 21 years old or more and as in<br>Britain they had to own property over a<br>certain value so that excluded most Mari<br>as many of you will know whose land was<br>communally<br>held the right to vote was extended to<br>all Mari men in<br>1867 but it was limited to electing four<br>Mighty<br>MPS and to All European men in<br>1879 in<br>1893 all women including Marty women<br>finally won the right to vote in<br>national elections but this world<br>leading shift came in part because women<br>enjoyed property rights and Leadership<br>rights at a time when these were denied<br>women at first New Zealand citizens<br>voted for individual MPS based on their<br>character their values and the policies<br>they<br>supported but around the end of the 19th<br>century as groups of MP started to Rally<br>around particular policies political<br>parties began to form I was kind of<br>surprised by this I didn't realize it<br>was you know a relatively recent phen<br>phenomenon under the first pass the post<br>system or fpp the candidate and<br>electorate with the most votes won the<br>seat as we know and the party with most<br>seats won the election uh the election<br>and this soon evolved into a two-party<br>system that often polarized decision-<br>making and the party that won the most<br>votes did not always win the<br>election and as we all know too in 1993<br>this was changed to an MMP system mixed<br>member proportional system in an attempt<br>to achieve more representative<br>governments under this system citizens<br>and again this is call for Newcastle<br>have two votes one for a party and one<br>for their local<br>MP parties are elected if they win at<br>least 5% of the party vote and at least<br>one electorate or at least one<br>electorate and under MMP one assumes<br>parties are parties are intended to<br>command influence roughly proportional<br>to their share their electoral support<br>and when that ceases to become the case<br>then MMP becomes<br>problematic so given this historic<br>background there are many ironies in<br>current debates around democracy and<br>t under the Queen's promises in white<br>Tangy a democracy might have emerged in<br>New Zealand at that time that was<br>actually Freer and more accountable and<br>more just than it was in Britain at the<br>same<br>time but instead of peace and tranquil<br>living as we all know there was war<br>followed by large scale confiscations of<br>land and harsh cultural<br>repression from that time till now that<br>promise of<br>equality being on an equal<br>footing for indigenous persons in New<br>Zealand has not been delivered as<br>so my thought is that in and I think<br>this thought is probably shared by the<br>royal families so the honor of Queen<br>Victoria and her descendants is at stake<br>along with the mner of the r who signed<br>descendants in 1975 when the white Hy<br>tribunal was established to try and make<br>mens for this history of broken<br>promises and uphold the Queen's honor<br>that was democracy and action supported<br>by the wider<br>electorate so throughout our history<br>there have been these intermittent<br>struggles between those who try to<br>uphold<br>tetti and the honor of the crown and of<br>the royal<br>family and those who wish to disregard<br>its<br>promises when Hau have United to uphold<br>their man for example in the K in<br>the this is almost variably been in<br>response to radical breaches of TTI for<br>example in the times of the northern<br>Wars and the land<br>Wars till<br>now and I think it's very important to<br>try and understand this<br>Dynamic while TTI itself may be a<br>multilateral agreement between the<br>various and their Hau and Queen<br>Victoria the crowns always found it more<br>convenient to try and deal with hu and<br>larger groupings whether it's ewi ewi<br>groupings Mighty race or the mighty<br>people but at the same time when treaty<br>promises are broken Hau leaders join<br>together to defend their people the<br>greater the threat The Wider the net is<br>cast in for forging these alliances and<br>I think this process is also very<br>visible in New Zealand at the<br>moment so given these given these<br>converging Dynamics<br>it's not really surprising that in<br>recent times T has often been recast as<br>this binary pack between the crown and<br>the Mari race or Mar and<br>parar rather than this multical<br>multilateral set of alliances between<br>Queen Victoria and Theo the various<br>tap but this kind of biracial framing<br>does have its<br>dangers Global Studies of a process<br>called pernicious<br>polarization have examined how<br>self-interested parties May play upon<br>these sorts of Divisions by quote<br>stoking fears anxieties and resentments<br>that then become expressed as hostility<br>bias even<br>enmity by choosing the cleavage or the<br>grievance to highlight they drive the<br>polarization to amplify their power it's<br>a<br>quote in this sort of process identities<br>whether these are political ethnic or<br>Rel religious may be reduced to simple<br>binaries left versus right<br>Democrats versus<br>Republicans black versus white Catholic<br>versus Protestant ewi versus<br>kiwi in this polarizing process quote<br>again from the scholarship identity can<br>become all encompassing as people view<br>those in the other camp with distrust<br>suspicion or fear and cease to interact<br>with them even segregating themselves in<br>their neighborhoods social relationships<br>people the middle ground becomes a<br>Battleground sometimes literally<br>moderate voices are<br>silenced and those with cross cross<br>cancelled in the case of politics this<br>can undermine good governance by making<br>parties much less likely to compromise<br>and to<br>strike um reach a consensus on matters<br>of national significance<br>and if left unchecked and this is what<br>the scholarship will tell you around the<br>world this kind of polarization could<br>split societies devastate nation states<br>wreck their economies and destroy the<br>lives of their<br>people this is happened in many many<br>countries serbs and croats in Bosnia<br>Catholics and Protestants in Ireland<br>Israel and Palestine and Gaza put and<br>tootsi and Rwanda and many other African<br>States and many analyses of are being<br>written about bitious polarization in<br>present and as for the political parties<br>involved in these kinds of processes and<br>I quote again incumbent polarizing<br>parties typically attempt to govern on<br>their own and isue norms for bipartisan<br>or multi-partisan decision<br>making that may include governing with<br>an absolute majority without consulting<br>the opposition or The Wider electorate<br>forging alliances with smaller more<br>extreme parties or governing by<br>repression the thing that is sobering as<br>I reflect on these on This Global<br>scholarship is that no country appears<br>to be immune from this kind of<br>politics even here after the 2020<br>election in New Zealand when labor won<br>an absolute majority the government did<br>engage in unilateral decision making on<br>some matters that or on existing social<br>cleavages Central versus local<br>government rural versus urban<br>communities Marty versus other new<br>zealanders in some<br>respects in their turn other political<br>agents then play upon these divisions<br>while in the past genuine Grievances and<br>structural disparities have been<br>addressed with bipartisan support<br>through the Whitey tribunal equal<br>opportunities programs creation of<br>Ministries to meet the needs of women<br>specific Islanders Mary the disabled<br>some politicians now depict these as<br>resentment I think what the scholarship<br>around the world would tell us that at<br>times of rising tensions strong<br>Democratic checks and balances are<br>vital in our country those inside<br>Parliament include the scrupulous<br>avoidance of conflicts of interests<br>opportunities for public input and<br>informed ADV advice select<br>committees and cross party cooperation<br>importance outside par they include a<br>politically neutral Public<br>Service independent bodies such as the<br>ombudsman the auditor general the<br>whiteny tribunal and the climate change<br>commission a free independent press an<br>independent Judiciary and un ities with<br>their statutory duty to serve as critics<br>society in recent times though almost<br>all of these checks and balances have<br>been<br>weakened inside Parliament urgencies<br>being used to avoid public input and<br>rigorous<br>debate ministers are awarding themselves<br>powers to make unilateral<br>decisions cross party cooperation on M<br>matters of national importance is<br>uncommon outside Parliament the<br>investigative role of the press is being<br>undermined by the rise of social media<br>which have robbed it of income and where<br>misinformation freely<br>circulates the impartiality of the<br>public service has been compromised by<br>political control the statutary role of<br>the universities as critics and<br>conscience of<br>society is challenged and pol<br>politicians are criticizing the<br>Judiciary and independent bodies<br>including the Whitey tribunal and the<br>commission and at the same time<br>increased inequality and power and<br>wealth along with lobbying and the<br>private funding of election campaigns<br>undermines Democratic checks and<br>balances as well if wealthy citizens<br>corporates and think tanks can gain<br>disproportionate influence through media<br>campaigns loving and campaign donations<br>and policies can be purchased as part of<br>the electoral<br>process that undermines public trust and<br>good<br>governance a combination of these risks<br>and failures is leading to a<br>catastrophic cats of faith and<br>democracy in many countries around the<br>world with authoritarian regimes a<br>as Benjamin Franklin another of the<br>founding fathers of democracy once<br>observed democratic government is not<br>established merely by<br>power there must be maintained a general<br>opinion of its wisdom and it's Justice<br>to make it firm and<br>durable so here's some final Thoughts<br>From Me while getting towards there<br>about what would a wise and just<br>government look like in alter or New<br>Zealand<br>I think in the beginning a wise and just<br>government would seek a balance between<br>Collective<br>freedoms rather than setting these up as<br>ideological<br>opposites both are fundamental to a<br>thriving<br>democracy polarization around ethnicity<br>dangerous unilateral decision- making<br>whatever Direction Sparks the resentment<br>that can ignite pernicious<br>polarization discussions that exclude<br>the descendants of the various andu<br>sign or the descendants of the incoming<br>settlers are cases in<br>point T is a relational<br>PCT and all parties involved in its<br>promises must be<br>respected once again it's a question of<br>balance<br>friendship a wise just government would<br>also I think pursue long-term policies<br>aimed at delivering thriving Landscapes<br>and communities across<br>Alor in the wake of cyclone Gabrielle<br>and tid Alti where I live a lot of the<br>time we have seen how an Unholy alliance<br>between lobbyists politicians and<br>extractive industries can play out<br>when forestry wastes sweep down river<br>destroying roads Bridges fences paddocks<br>Orchards Vineyards homes livelihoods and<br>even<br>lives industrial forestry having lobbied<br>hard and long to avoid environmental<br>controls inflicted crippling long-term<br>costs on the local community and the<br>regional<br>economy these sorts of policies are also<br>self-defeating<br>and this is something to ponder on right<br>now with forestry companies and TI Al<br>now losing their their International<br>accreditation for sustainability and<br>access to key<br>markets the same could happen to<br>Agriculture and Horticulture in New<br>careful I think wise and just government<br>would also conduct its business out in<br>the<br>open like many others I think the links<br>between politicians lobbyists and<br>funders in New Zealand is tooo opaque at<br>the<br>present it would be good to know for<br>example where the funding for a multi-<br>stranded and very costly campaign to<br>rewrite the Whitey is coming from and<br>this seems to be channeled through<br>groups that don't are not required to<br>report on their sources of<br>income the same applies to campaign to<br>weaken anti-smoking policies and<br>Environmental<br>Protections with well-designed processes<br>democracy can work at<br>speed this is not democracy at fault<br>it's the fault of regulatory<br>design furthermore as we've seen in<br>tarity destroying the environment for<br>short-term profit is economically as<br>well as ecologically<br>self-destructive it's also the opposite<br>of localized democracy where local<br>people have a real say in decision<br>making under such a regime the one that<br>we've been looking at in the fast track<br>hill where three Ministers of all the<br>people in New<br>Zealand make final decisions about major<br>projects the likelihood of conflicts of<br>interests<br>and H battle Barrel politics is obvious<br>and I just don't think that any<br>government should be trusted with that<br>power and under<br>mmp2 the link between the votes that are<br>cast for particular parties and policy<br>outcomes can become<br>tenuous small parties hitch their wagons<br>to larger ones and forc through policies<br>policies that at the time of the<br>election attracted very little support<br>from the<br>electorate this kind of disproportionate<br>empowerment perod trust in Parliament<br>and the and the Democratic process as<br>well so we have to recognize that this<br>is not an issue just for altero New<br>Zealand is happening across the globe at<br>present democracy is under siege and the<br>strategies being deployed are well<br>documented in much of the scholarship<br>I'm referring<br>to although the authors of the studies<br>of pernicious polarization offer no<br>Silver Bullet for combating its threats<br>to democratic checks and balances they<br>warn that responding in kind with v<br>vilification threats and reprisals only<br>speeds up the process<br>rather they suggest casting light on<br>these sorts of devices and those who<br>deploy them greater transparency and<br>oversight of links between funders and<br>politicians as the audit General has<br>just suggested and the deliberate<br>strengthening of the middle<br>ground through b bipartisan policymaking<br>with wide Civic engagement that reaches<br>across these boundaries and these<br>divisions well moderated inclusive<br>conversations about and matters whether<br>in citizens assemblies or or wherever we<br>can come up with our<br>Forum because here in Alon New Zealand<br>our ancestors nearly all of them I guess<br>came to create Better Lives for<br>themselves and their<br>children including<br>mine this led to a robust independence<br>of mind coupl with a sense of social<br>responsibility and the idea of a fair go<br>a powerful<br>combination as Citizens we have the<br>right and the duty to demand honest wise<br>and feir governance from our leaders and<br>to help devise solutions to the<br>us as Peter T has said white recently AR<br>is a person who weaves people<br>together the must listen to the<br>people if they do not listen<br>they will be cast<br>aside that I think is the true promise<br>of<br>tet instead of trying to divide us we<br>need leaders who will look far into the<br>future listen to the people take the<br>best strands of our ancestral leg<br>Together what would this look like I<br>think a lot of it's happening on the<br>I think of the multitude of Charities<br>across the country that care for those<br>in need restore local Landscapes support<br>the Arts and Sport and strengthen<br>Community networks that go across all of<br>these<br>boundaries the M that in times of Crisis<br>where the floods or earthquakes open<br>their doors to The Wider community so<br>people have food to eat and a place to<br>sleep or the catchment groups where<br>people from different backgrounds<br>ethnicities religions come together to<br>waterways this is democracy at the flax<br>roots in the Grassroots led by people<br>trusted by their peers who know how to<br>make a positive<br>difference it's the opposite of top-<br>down divisive politics with<br>self-interest rules and power and wealth<br>are highly<br>concentrated I listen to the maiden<br>speeches many of them after the election<br>and I can tell that right across the<br>political Spectrum there are many of<br>these kinds of leaders have made their<br>way into<br>Parliament I hope they will stand<br>tall and fight for wise just government<br>in our country the kind that cares for<br>chant listen listen listen to The Cry of<br>one bind above bind below bind Within<br>bind without tie the
