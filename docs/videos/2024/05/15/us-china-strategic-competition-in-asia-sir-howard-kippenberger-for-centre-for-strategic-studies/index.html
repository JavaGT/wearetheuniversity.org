the director of the<br>center for strategic studies here at<br>taring aaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington and it's my pleasure to<br>welcome you all this evening to this<br>public lecture by our 2024 sir Howard<br>kienberger visiting chair in strategic<br>studies Professor Michael Green from uh<br>the head of the United States studies<br>Center at the University uh of Sydney<br>now um people say that technology is<br>going to steal jobs but I have to say<br>the fact that that video has just<br>relieved me of my one only important job<br>to tell you that health and safety<br>instructions I think is uh is delightful<br>I'm very pleased about that and instead<br>I'll use the time to put in a short plug<br>for the center for strategic studies CSS<br>was established 31 years ago as New<br>Zealand's focal point for research on uh<br>research and engagement on Strategic<br>Defense and foreign policy issues<br>1993 uh was a time in which the region<br>appeared to be increasingly integrating<br>it was a time in which the United States<br>and China were entering a new era of<br>Engagement and it was a time in which<br>conditions in the region and globally<br>seemed really favorable for small open<br>trading<br>democracies fast forward 31 years and<br>things look much more troubling<br>strategic competition between the great<br>Powers has become the theme of our time<br>decoupling and drisking have replaced<br>the drive of integration and whether or<br>not we think whether we think about<br>Ukraine or the wars in the Middle East<br>uh or coercion in East Asia the security<br>picture looks much more much more<br>challenging the most challenging it has<br>for decades in these trouble times the<br>center for strategic studies tries to<br>make a contribution to public debates<br>about New Zealand's place in the world<br>we do it through our research through<br>the work of my excellent colleagues<br>through media commentary in<br>participating in public discussions and<br>in track to diplomacy and in doing that<br>we're grateful always for the support of<br>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and<br>trade of the New Zealand Defense Force<br>uh and the New Zealand Ministry of<br>defense and I'd like to acknowledge from<br>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs uh<br>deputy secretary debah gills and former<br>Secretary of Foreign Affairs and trade<br>Chris CED who are both with us this<br>evening one of the highlights of our<br>year is uh and the highlight of the of<br>the year I think is welcoming the S<br>Howard kienberger visiting chair in<br>strategic studies and hosting their<br>lecture so without any further Ado from<br>me it's now my pleasure to ask the<br>University's Vice Chancellor Professor<br>Nick Smith to introduce tonight's<br>distinguished speaker please welcome<br>Vice Chancellor Nick Smith<br>Teno tenot so I'd like to add my welcome<br>to David's um this is a wonderful<br>evening for the University each year uh<br>it's wonderful to Welcome Friends of the<br>institution uh citizens of Wellington uh<br>staff students and alumni to what I<br>think is a fantastic event I<br>particularly like to extend my welcome<br>to Jill and Sarah kappenberger Jill is<br>the Widow of Sir Howard's son Jeremy and<br>Sarah is Sir Howard's granddaughter as<br>David has alluded to the sir Howard<br>kienberger V visiting chair in strategic<br>studies honors Major General Sir Howard<br>kienberger he was one of New Zealand's<br>most distinguished soldiers he was an<br>eminent scholar and strategist and he<br>also served as president of New Zealand<br>return Services Association in that<br>career he produced 23 volumes of New<br>Zealand's official War<br>histories from that Legacy the S Howard<br>kienberger visiting chair and strategic<br>studies and the kienberger lecture are<br>enormous assets for this University<br>there's nothing else quite like it in<br>austral Asia and we've had some of the<br>very best scholars in international<br>Affairs come and give us their knowledge<br>expertise and perspectives and tonight<br>is certainly no exception uh Professor<br>Michael Green well Mike as I've learned<br>he prefers to be known is a professor at<br>Georgetown and also is now affiliated<br>with the University of Sydney he the<br>Henry Kissinger chair in strategy at the<br>center of strategic and international<br>studies in Washington and we were just<br>talking about uh Sir Henry uh who has<br>been quoted in many contexts my favorite<br>Kissinger quote is that one of the great<br>things he found out being famous was<br>that he could bore people at dinner<br>parties and they thought it was their<br>fault Mike may not be quite as famous as<br>Sir Henry but I have no doubt that<br>tonight we will not be bored he is one<br>of the leading scholars in the United<br>States policy and engagement in the<br>indopacific region and his book more<br>than Providence provides a wonderful<br>account of America's engagement in our<br>region from the late 1700s to the end of<br>the Obama Administration it won the<br>Council on Foreign Relations Arthur Ross<br>medal for the best book in international<br>Affairs he is also an international<br>expert in Japan's foreign and defense<br>relations and for those who remember the<br>sir Howard kienberger lecture from last<br>year which brought a Chinese perspective<br>to the uh China America conflict tonight<br>we're going to hear from a Japanese<br>and American perspective and it'll be<br>very interesting to see if we come to a<br>similar set of conclusions tonight's<br>lecture Mike Will explore the long-term<br>strategic competition between the US and<br>China what drove the things to the<br>current point that we have uh got to and<br>importantly I think for all our futures<br>do Washington and Beijing have the guard<br>rails in place to prevent conflict<br>what's the space for ouro in New Zealand<br>and other us allies and partners to to<br>shape the Dynamics uh as constructively<br>as possible going<br>forward I'd like to finish by once again<br>thanking the kienberger family and the<br>principal sponsor the Garfield Watson<br>foundation for their ongoing support<br>which makes this possible uh their uh<br>very generous donation most recently in<br>2023 has meant they were able to<br>continue to invite World leading<br>Scholars to take up the chair here at<br>Victoria for many years to<br>come I'll finish Now by uh asking you<br>all to put your hands together to<br>welcome Professor Michael Green<br>uh thank you Professor Smith thank you<br>David it's wonderful to be here this is<br>a really amazing room um I've admired uh<br>Professor Cap's work and followed the<br>center for strategic studies some of my<br>closest friends from the US Canada Japan<br>and China have spoken in this uh<br>kienberger Series so I'm very proud to<br>join them and delighted to meet um Jill<br>and Sarah um General kienberger was a um<br>scholar practitioner which I have<br>aspired to be throughout my whole career<br>it's also wonderful for me to be back in<br>New Zealand because my wife and I<br>honeymooned here um and um now we're<br>here with our teenage kids um we spent a<br>week around Queenstown I gave a talk in<br>Queenstown we um we chased uh rainbow<br>trout on the tongo river um after about<br>three or four days we live in Sydney now<br>my son said you know Dad the um the New<br>Zealand trout are a lot smarter than the<br>Australian trout um and L you think I'm<br>cating favor I reminded him that the New<br>Zealand trout came from<br>California um but I'm from the East<br>Coast so that's a painful admission to<br>make um I'm going to talk about uh uh us<br>uh engagement in the region us strategy<br>um the nature of the US China strategic<br>competition um what it means for New<br>Zealand and other friends in the region<br>um but traveling around the North and<br>South Island I sort of collected<br>Impressions um uh I fancy myself a bit<br>like Mark Twain um who famously traveled<br>here in 1895 until I read that Twain was<br>broke um had writer's block and was<br>cranky throughout the whole visit so<br>David can tell you during the reception<br>whether that's accurate or not but I<br>don't think I've been broke cranky or<br>had writer block um but I I I I was very<br>interested in my son's a history buff<br>and we were just looking um for little<br>bits and pieces of evidence of how<br>America America impacted New Zealand<br>I've written about this but not in great<br>detail because my books are mostly about<br>Japan and North Asia or about the whole<br>region and some of the Impressions I had<br>were were were really fascinating um in<br>the North Island we we we we we went to<br>PA to Maui uh fortresses read about the<br>the wars um and read about the USS St<br>Louis the Sloop of war that in 1845<br>evacuated citizens um at the attle of<br>kaka um save them together with other us<br>whaling<br>ships um and then read about uh<br>suspicions um that the American Council<br>General had been encouraging resistance<br>to British rule because the Whalers had<br>been happier um when um New Zealand was<br>not a colony um we read about the Great<br>White Fleet Theodore Roosevelt's Great<br>White Fleet arriving in Auckland in 1908<br>um apparently the population of Auckland<br>at the time was 40 or 50,000 and 100,000<br>kiwis came out to greet the sailors and<br>Marines um prime minister gave a rousing<br>speech praising America's concept of<br>Liberty and the role America would play<br>in stabilizing the Pacific um meanwhile<br>on board the flagship a US Marine major<br>was sketching pictures of the harbor to<br>plan attack uh should we ever go to war<br>with Britain um yeah if it's any<br>constellation at the same time the US<br>Army was touring Toronto and Montreal<br>and planning their attack ATT um uh<br>because in 1908 war with Britain was<br>conceivable and terrifying for the US<br>Navy because it would have been a two<br>ocean war couldn't attack London we<br>might be able to attack Auckland um we<br>toured just north of here the famous<br>encampment of the first and second<br>Marine Division um my wife's grandfather<br>would have been there he was a marine<br>pilot in the Pacific um and again the<br>the the enormous relief uh when the<br>first Marine Division landed before<br>going to guad Canal<br>because New Zealand was almost<br>completely undefended uh against an<br>expanding Japan but then when you read<br>the history of the uh experience<br>historians say it transformed New<br>Zealand Society um not always for the<br>for the good um fuses famously wrote uh<br>in the pelian wars and international<br>relations Theory students will probably<br>study this but in international<br>relations the smaller partner always has<br>a real dilemma with the bigger partner<br>um on the one hand if you grow Too Close<br>you risk entament in conflicts Wars that<br>the bigger power gets you in that you<br>don't want the other hand if you try too<br>hard to emphasize sovereignty and<br>distance you end up risking<br>abandonment and you can see little<br>traces of entrapment and abandonment<br>throughout this sort of uh<br>impressionistic Mark Twain type tour I<br>was taking um of course 1985 and the bre<br>break of anas Iraq war there are lots of<br>examples and now today um I was<br>interviewed on NZ TV today the big<br>question is what will us China strategic<br>competition do to New Zealand um so I<br>want to try to shed some light on that<br>um uh all too often um the US is<br>presented like the<br>weather um there are no exogenous<br>factors there's not much you can do um<br>so just get an umbrella or get your<br>sunblock and prepare for it comes but of<br>course the US is an extremely<br>complicated country as many of you would<br>know and US<br>strategy throughout the history of the<br>Republic and engagement with China today<br>has multiple facets multiple things<br>shaping it um and I'll end the talk by<br>trying to convince you that even New<br>Zealand has some agency uh in shaping<br>how the US approaches China and the<br>region<br>um and that's because the American<br>system learns um<br>the uh quote is attributed to Winston<br>Churchill it wasn't actually Churchill<br>um but we'll say for now was Churchill<br>who said you can always count on the<br>Americans to do all the wrong thing<br>before they eventually do the right<br>thing um the US is um as mine AR put it<br>still the indispensable power for all<br>the flaws and living in Sydney and<br>traveling throughout Asia you see that<br>as an American clearly and the reason is<br>pretty clear and my favorite anecdote to<br>capture it it's from the<br>1980s um uh in the Reagan<br>Administration um and um the longi<br>government had trouble with the Reagan<br>Administration but so did many Western<br>European governments because of um INF<br>intermediate nuclear forces and uh<br>competition with the Soviet Union and in<br>one uh meeting before the NATO foreign<br>ministers Summit um the Europeans all<br>met to get ready to meet with um<br>secretary George Schultz I think it was<br>and they were all winging about the<br>Americans and all complaining about<br>Reagan and all complaining about<br>unilateralism and all the rest of it and<br>then the British foreign secretary<br>reportedly stood up and said yes yes yes<br>the Americans are all the things you say<br>they are they're also the only Americans<br>we<br>have um and so um it's worth<br>understanding<br>um the why where um uh of American<br>engagement with Asia and uh with China<br>so the first thing is what does United<br>States want in the Indo<br>Pacific um obviously trade and all the<br>things any country<br>wants um it's not Primacy in my view you<br>will often uh see Scholars um I find<br>this particularly in Australia who argue<br>that the root of Sino American<br>competition and geopolitical troubles<br>today is that the Americans insist on<br>Primacy um Scholars will point to one<br>document um the Trump administration's<br>National Security strategy which<br>referenced primac<br>um I know the authors<br>um they did not mean priming the sense<br>of um dominance um but that's about the<br>only reference people come back to it<br>again and again I think a more accurate<br>description of the American objective uh<br>in the indo-pacific<br>is that um from the beginning of the<br>Republic the United States um could not<br>um tolerate a rival hegemonic power<br>trying to push the us out of the region<br>um and that goes pretty far back um and<br>the answer was balance of power not<br>Primacy not domination but balance a<br>favorable balance of power I think<br>people often forget how cheap the<br>American voters are privacy is<br>incredibly<br>expensive um taxpayers want security um<br>at a good rate which is why balance of<br>power has been the consistent preference<br>in American foreign policy and as I said<br>it goes back quite far um when I was<br>working on my book by more than<br>Providence um I started the book in<br>1783 um the Treaty of Paris was 1784<br>America was still fighting for<br>Independence in 1783 so why 1783 because<br>in that year um and what one of the<br>wonderful things about diplomatic<br>history in the digital age is you can<br>find things online and you can search<br>archives digitally and and and uh find<br>things that when you pour through<br>documents which I also did for my book<br>you might not come across so I<br>discovered a letter from Thomas<br>Jefferson to um Colonel Clark on the<br>frontier which in 1783 would have been<br>what is today Western<br>Pennsylvania um fighting the British<br>fighting their Native American Allies um<br>that was the Wild West in 1783 and uh<br>Jefferson wrote to him to warn him that<br>American spies in London um had<br>discovered that the British were raising<br>funds to send an expedition across<br>Canada um after America became<br>independent to ensure that Britain<br>secured access to the Pacific Northwest<br>first and Jefferson in 1783 said that<br>must be us and um famously the<br>expedition of Lewis and Clark when he<br>was president had that as part of its<br>Mission and there are numerous examples<br>afterwards the um uh the Tyler Doctrine<br>um uh which uh sort of paralleled the<br>Monroe Doctrine um in the 1840s when<br>President Tyler declared that Hawaii The<br>Sandwich Islands must never fall under<br>the domination of another country<br>specifically Britain France um if the US<br>Navy had tried to fight the Royal Navy<br>in 1841 we would have probably lost um<br>uh but what Tyler understood was he<br>could play the British and French<br>against each other<br>um the Russia Japanese war inspired<br>theodo Roosevelt um in part because he<br>saw Japan as a counterbalance to Russia<br>uh at the turn of the century in the<br>early early 20th century um the San<br>Francisco treaty system that created<br>anas and the US Japan Alliance and later<br>Korea Taiwan and so forth uh was<br>designed to have a forward um set of<br>alliances to maintain a favorable<br>balance of power to Leverage The Power<br>of other countries Nixon's opening to<br>China was not really about um uh I mean<br>Nixon romanticized it a bit but it<br>wasn't really about um uh exploring uh<br>us China relations it was about<br>countering the Soviets and allowing the<br>US to get out of the Vietnam War by<br>resetting the Strategic table um I<br>worked in the Pentagon in the mid 90s I<br>was did my PhD on Japan's<br>post-war um uh foreign and defense<br>policies and was brought out of<br>University into the Pentagon to help uh<br>in the Clinton Administration to um uh<br>rejuvenate the US Japan Alliance after<br>the Cold War um because um of concern<br>about how China was using its Growing<br>Power around<br>Taiwan um I was hired into the bush<br>white house but offered the same job by<br>Al Gore's campaign um uh to manage<br>alliances with the same intent ended up<br>working on India the bush<br>administration's opening to India was<br>about setting that uh balance of power<br>so that's been the preferred approach<br>but since Nixon um always predic at on<br>what Harvard Professor Joseph NY calls a<br>strategy of engage in Balance engage<br>China explore um improved relations but<br>maintain um a favorable balance of power<br>with allies and with Rising powers like<br>India to secure a more stable Indo<br>Pacific when I was in the white<br>house um relations with China were much<br>better of course than they are today um<br>the uh President Bush his father was the<br>first US Representative to the PRC and<br>he had bicycled around Beijing as a as a<br>kid and um his father would frequently<br>call him in the Oval Office to talk<br>about China policy and China<br>strategy um Bush hired me to work on<br>alliances because he thought we would<br>need them um but he worked hard on China<br>relations um after the ep3 incident in<br>April 2001 when a Chinese fighter jet<br>collided with an American Patrol plane<br>and the US plane crash landed in hyan<br>island and was was kept by the Chinese<br>government um President Bush tried to<br>call Jang Zaman um 11<br>times and the foreign Ministry would not<br>put Jung on the phone um and President<br>Bush realized that the management of us<br>China relations required um more than<br>any other relationship in the world uh<br>presidential initiative and Leadership<br>because the Chinese system could not<br>produce strategic decisions you had to<br>go to the top and he invested a great<br>amount of time in his relationship with<br>Jang Zin um and with hentau he invited<br>Jang Zim into the ranch his Ranch in<br>Crawford Texas which when John Howard<br>went was a great privilege when kisi<br>went to the ranch it was a great<br>privilege actually Ki wanted to go to<br>graceand to uh Japanese prime minister<br>to to to look at his Idol um Elvis<br>Presley's birthplace and Homeland or<br>whatever<br>um but but President Bush did this as a<br>special gesture and the Chinese forign<br>Ministry explained to Jang that this<br>rundown Dusty Ranch in Texas is actually<br>a sign of great respect for you um and<br>President Bush was able to talk to Jang<br>Zan about almost anything um he told<br>Jang that um as China grew it would find<br>that Marxism leninism was uh<br>insufficient to the Social Challenges<br>China would face and that Jang should<br>consider greater religious freedom for<br>the people JN Zan listened came back to<br>the next Summit he was an engineer of<br>course and he said to President Bush you<br>know I studied the Bible after we talked<br>and I just don't think it's plausible um<br>but he did at least engage in the<br>conversation when President Bush got<br>reelected um he um he sent me to Beijing<br>with a letter uh to president<br>hinau um the letter listed issues that<br>he wanted to work on with China<br>regarding North Korea for example in<br>particular North Korea but also said in<br>his second term he wanted to work with<br>hentau to bring us China relations to<br>the next level it was a positive vision<br>and huin taau had a positive Vision um I<br>delivered the letter to the foreign<br>minister um because as many of you would<br>know the Chinese Farm industry is<br>particularly um inflexible about<br>protocol um and I but but um the farm<br>Minister asked to see me at the Hall of<br>the people which was unusual and I went<br>in and CCTV had cameras and he came up<br>and he grabbed my hand and he said I<br>have someone special I want you to meet<br>if you've been to the Great Hall of<br>people it's massive and so for what was<br>probably about 200 meters I walked in<br>front of the Chinese cameras holding<br>hands with the Chinese foreign minister<br>which is awkward but in diplomacy you do<br>have to do and he took me in for a<br>15minute audience with hinau um who<br>conveyed his um wishes to President Bush<br>that was the level at which China its<br>leaders thought they needed a good<br>relationship with the American president<br>hentau went out of his way to avoid um<br>uh provocative statements uh the theory<br>at the time Advanced um by some Chinese<br>Scholars was about China's peaceful rise<br>hentau changed that to China's peaceful<br>development he um in his Summits with<br>President Bush always open by all the<br>challenges he faced at home uh 25<br>million people moving to the city<br>from the country every year looking for<br>work<br>and he wanted to um uh convince and<br>reassure uh the president of the United<br>States that while we had problems North<br>Korea Taiwan human rights religious<br>freedom uh China was not in the business<br>of challenging the International System<br>um on the specifics disagreeing but not<br>challenging that changed of course<br>significantly with um with xiin Bing um<br>and uh it's a long list I'll spare you<br>um you'd be much more aware of it if you<br>were in Tokyo or Delhi or Taipei or<br>Manila um But it includes uh I think for<br>many of us uh the sort of Clarion call<br>was chin Ping's April 2014 speech<br>calling for um the end of foreign blocks<br>in Asia was a direct assault on the<br>American alliance system and there's<br>more to that story but um it was at a<br>summit in Shanghai and the Chinese<br>government was pushing Korea and other<br>us um countries to sign on to a joint<br>statement saying no more blocks which<br>the Koreans and others refus to do the<br>building of artificial Islands in 20145<br>President Obama asked to told president<br>shei that that um the US would consider<br>it a threat if um the pla armed the<br>islands um president shei promised he<br>wouldn't today those islands are um uh<br>10 times the size of a US aircraft<br>carrier as large as Dallas airport<br>bigger and bristling with missiles and<br>able to take the entire inventory of the<br>pla Air Force bombers Fighters and<br>basically a dominant um air air position<br>over the South China<br>Sea um the dlan the Himalayan<br>confrontation with Indians which had<br>been non-lethal for decades but uh but<br>the pl pla went at the Indian troops<br>with with with with weapons um<br>circumnavigating Japan regularly um and<br>um breaking the traditional uh division<br>between Taiwan and China this line<br>across which neither sides Air Force<br>would cross and now regularly Crossing<br>it with large flights of bombers um the<br>US the Obama Administration clung to um<br>an earlier vision which had<br>continued with only occasional<br>Interruption from Nixon through Obama of<br>building towards the next level in us<br>China relations but the administration<br>was<br>divided<br>um uh some in the Obama Administration<br>saw an opportunity in what shiin pink<br>offered in the shinjin dagi I'm a<br>Japanese and Kore speaker my shin TA in<br>Japanese a new model of great power<br>relations um Shin is new great<br>power um some people in the and the<br>Obama Administration said this might be<br>a way to stabilize things after all of<br>this turmoil others strongly opposed<br>osed it because the the great power<br>uh included the US China Russia but not<br>Japan or India or other us allies and<br>partners President Obama himself never<br>embraced the concept um but the American<br>public was also somewhat divided in 2013<br>the Chicago Council on global Affairs<br>asked the American public is our future<br>in Asia um better served by um focusing<br>on China or focusing on Japan Australia<br>and traditional democracies<br>and it was a very close and divided<br>American public uh the allies and<br>partners had 40 some percent um China<br>had slightly less um so the American<br>public was also quite divided about<br>whether the future in Asia was was was<br>really about um a new condominium with a<br>rising China um Xi Jinping has largely<br>killed that in poll's now 80 to 90% of<br>Americans say it's about our allies and<br>partners um support for alliances in the<br>US has not been this high in many many<br>decades interestingly when Americans are<br>asked in polls we do at my Center why do<br>you support the alliance uh Network we<br>have um one of the leading answers now<br>for the first time is because our allies<br>make us more secure there's a there's a<br>sense in the American public that the US<br>is actually dependent on our allies um<br>I'm sure we'll talk about Aus the um<br>agreement among the US Australia and the<br>UK on submarine and advanced<br>technology to me as a historian of<br>American foreign policy the most<br>remarkable part of that is that the US<br>and the US Congress agreed to<br>transfer um one of the most sensitive US<br>military Technologies we've only ever<br>transferred nuclear propulsion before<br>once and that was to the Royal Navy in<br>1957 but by very wide margins in the<br>Congress they passed this legislation<br>allowing um allowing not only the<br>transfer of nuclear propulsion<br>technology but um but waving itar and<br>other restrictions on Australia um and<br>that's because of the politics people in<br>the US sense we really need our allies<br>um the Biden Administration has um<br>chocked up some big wins on allies Aus<br>um which uh would not have happened four<br>or five years ago um the US Japan<br>Australia trilateral uh relationship<br>which when prime minister kashir was in<br>Washington um went to an entirely new<br>level with agreements on cooperating on<br>missile defense and Japan being the<br>first um uh country beyond the US<br>Australia and the UK to be associated<br>with and participated in AUST pillar two<br>um the US Japan Philippines trilateral<br>Summit um us Japan Korea uh I've worked<br>on that since I was in the Pentagon in<br>the 90s very hard because of Japan Korea<br>relations um but the Summit held by<br>President y prime minister kishida and<br>uh President Biden at Camp David<br>was very<br>significant um the quad and the quad<br>Summits um very significant the Biden<br>Administration is doing things with<br>allies and partners that the bush or<br>Obama administrations did maybe once a<br>year the Biden Administration is doing<br>them once a month<br>um why well I think President Biden gets<br>some credit but I often say the gold<br>medal for this goes to xiin<br>Ping um uh I do not think and I'm told<br>by my Australian colleagues that um the<br>Australian political system would not<br>have um uh accepted nuclear powered<br>submarines five or 10 years ago just as<br>the American system would not have<br>accepted transferring that<br>technology they do now but if the gold<br>medal goes to Xi Jinping um the silver<br>medal at least has to go to Japan and ab<br>Shinzo because it's AB who constructed a<br>framework for competing with China<br>without catastrophe<br>um I've also written a book on ab's<br>Grand strategy called line of Advantage<br>but AB um introduced into the<br>Lexicon many in fact most of the key<br>pillars of not only Biden's foreign<br>policy towards Asia but also trumps and<br>one thing I hope you'll take away from<br>this is how much agency Japan has in<br>Washington how influential Japan in<br>particular is on American<br>strategy the free and open indopacific<br>strategy which is obious construct for<br>working with New Zealand with Australia<br>with India investing in infrastructure<br>and financing um helping Asian countries<br>become more resilient um this freen open<br>Indo Pacific was an a uh construct um<br>early in the Trump<br>Administration um a classmate of mine<br>from Johns Hopkins um who was the policy<br>planning Chief in the Japanese fign<br>Ministry came to Washington and he met<br>with his new counterpart in the new<br>Trump administ ation um and um this um<br>American said you know Secretary of<br>State Rex Tillerson has to give a speech<br>at csis next month about our Asia<br>strategy and Donald Trump doesn't have<br>one and so Suzuki San from the guu show<br>The Farm Ministry said well actually I'm<br>here to brief you on ours it's called a<br>free and open Indo Pacific strategy<br>we're going to invest in diplomatic<br>relations across Asia we're gonna<br>Network and cooperate on infrastructure<br>financing and development and make Asia<br>more<br>resilient three weeks at csis csis<br>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson gave<br>the inaugural Trump Administration<br>speech on Asia and the Trump<br>Administration strategy for a free and<br>open Indo<br>Pacific uh you know in in diplomacy<br>plagiarism you get an A plagiarisms good<br>my colleague from the farm Ministry was<br>thrilled um the interesting thing is<br>when Biden came into office some of his<br>advisers said well we can't keep calling<br>our strategy in Asia free and open into<br>Pacific because that's Trump and then<br>someone pointed out no it's Japan and<br>Biden said well then we're going to keep<br>it first person you met was uh then<br>prime minister sugga it's the quad as<br>well um and so the the Japanese uh<br>impact is really important and it<br>reminds us once again this is not a us<br>China bilateral or bipolar game it's a<br>multiplayer multipolar game with<br>significant agency from Japan from India<br>from Korea uh from Indonesia and<br>Australia and from New Zealand um should<br>um countries choose to exercise it<br>um now um how is it going how is the US<br>strategy going<br>well and they're building up Allies and<br>partners pretty well actually as I was<br>suggesting but there are five challenges<br>that the us is going to face five<br>variables as social scientists would say<br>that are worth<br>watching the first one is how does this<br>end um the US is now in uh broadly<br>acknowledge across across the US<br>political Spectrum strategic competition<br>with<br>China also the language used in Brussels<br>Tokyo um canura<br>Canada um but how does it end if you're<br>in a<br>competition is there a winner is there a<br>loser the Japanese um diet um the ruling<br>ldp um issued a major strategy report uh<br>a few years ago that set up the increase<br>in the Japanese defense budget to 2% of<br>GDP P the introduction of um longrange<br>Strike weapons and all sorts of things<br>that in pacifist Japan as Sheila Smith<br>would have told you would have been<br>Unthinkable a few years ago but the<br>whole strategic document began with a<br>paragraph that said our strategic<br>objective is a more productive<br>relationship with<br>China Penny Wong the Australian foreign<br>minister has um labor government fully<br>invested in Aus she has said Australia's<br>objective is stabilization with China uh<br>the Korean Farm has used similar<br>language um the US National Security<br>strategy um produced by the White House<br>under President Biden says about this um<br>the<br>following peaceful coexistence with<br>China is not necessarily<br>impossible um I know the guy who wrote<br>it I tease him all the time I said you<br>sound like Dr Spock from Star Trek who<br>talks like that and he said who talks<br>like that bureaucrats who don't have a<br>consensus um there's no consensus in the<br>US about how this ends where this goes<br>and if you have<br>a strategy for managing uh competition<br>with China that is heavily dependent on<br>and involves lots of investments in<br>allies and partners you'd better bloody<br>well listen to them and you can already<br>start to see um in the Biden<br>administration's approach um adjustments<br>since President Biden met um xiin ping<br>in San Francisco and the reopening of<br>some dialogue the second uncertainty is<br>implementation these are very very big<br>things<br>um Aus was big many of the hard parts<br>are done um kishida in Washington said<br>he wanted the US to upgrade the US<br>command in Japan it's a three- Star<br>General now they want a four-star like<br>NATO um Biden agreed um that's<br>technically<br>complicated um uh so actually really um<br>making these alliances Partnerships work<br>is is tough um third challenge is trade<br>policy us basically doesn't have one<br>right now uh my first job in government<br>was in the US trade Representatives<br>Office negotiating with the Japanese<br>over the garbage disposal market so I<br>was young there was a powerful Senator<br>named Pete Wilson from California whose<br>best friend owned the uh biggest US<br>garbage disposal company and the<br>Japanese trade Ministry had said that<br>Japanese garbage is different and<br>therefore it won't work in American<br>machines so I um in my 20s negotiated<br>that one um<br>and uh and now the Japanese can enjoy<br>good garbage disposing um the US um as<br>you know in the Constitution Congress<br>has the power to authorize trade<br>agreements um and so the president has<br>had to go to Congress for trade<br>promotion Authority uh to<br>negotiate um<br>uh almost always passed there's only one<br>exception uh through the Bush<br>Administration where a trade agreement<br>didn't pass hard work we had to get the<br>Cattlemen and the farmers to go door too<br>in Congress to support we had to get um<br>a strategic argument one of my jobs in<br>the White House was making the Strategic<br>argument for the US Korea us Australia<br>us Singapore<br>ftas um the consensus although it was<br>contested was that um trade<br>liberalization is an absolutely<br>indispensable part of an American<br>strategy for stabilizing the world<br>um after the experiences of smooth Holly<br>the 1930s protectionism and war that<br>consensus is basically broken in<br>Washington and in the US a majority of<br>of the public and especially younger<br>Americans are very prot<br>trade um the problem is that in<br>2016 um Hillary Clinton lost Michigan uh<br>Western Pennsylvania Ohio because Trade<br>union voters who normally vote Democrat<br>voted for Donald Trump because he<br>campaigned against trade against the<br>transpacific partnership against<br>NAFTA and this election again uh will<br>come down to probably 1 or2 200,000<br>votes in the key swing States um which<br>will include Wisconsin and again<br>Pennsylvania and Michigan so um The<br>Electoral politics of trade make it very<br>hard um the US has a bit of an advantage<br>because the US economy is strong um the<br>chips act the inflation reduction act<br>subsidies are drawing huge investments<br>into the US every major chip<br>manufacturer in the world is building a<br>plant in the US right now so in some<br>ways American economic statecraft is<br>working but in other ways it's offering<br>very little uh to the region that's a<br>problem fourth problem is the global<br>South uh which I think is a term we can<br>use the Indians prefer the global South<br>um and that's a very complicated picture<br>The Institute for Southeast Asian<br>studies survey that came out recently in<br>Singapore um showed a marked decline in<br>um favorability towards the US<br>um probably because of Gaza um perhaps<br>also Ukraine um it's going to be<br>extremely challenging um to um compete<br>um in the global South<br>um the disinformation environment um<br>corruption and Elite capture<br>postcolonial um resentments all these<br>things make it a tough operating<br>environment for oecd countries um on the<br>other hand in surveys um across South<br>and Southeast Asia um democracy is by<br>far the preferred form of government and<br>Democratic Norms are by far the<br>preferred um<br>philosophy um and this is not<br>competition that's just involving the us<br>or Australia involves India and Japan<br>and the Philippines but that's a<br>challenge and people in Washington were<br>a lot about that and then finally the<br>the big one and I'll end with this to<br>ruin your evening uh the election in<br>2024 and Donald<br>Trump<br>um Donald Trump<br>is the most divisive president in my<br>memory probably in<br>history um he's more enamored of<br>dictators than any president in American<br>history uh particularly Putin um he's<br>not someone you would want at the podium<br>in a crisis because you don't know what<br>he'll say<br>but when a German politician after the<br>Munich security s Summit recently told<br>the press that Europe will now face two<br>authoritarian States and Rivals Russia<br>and the US that was that was<br>ridiculous um Mark Twain who um uh after<br>hearing the music of Rickard Vagner was<br>asked what he thought said it's not as<br>bad as it<br>sounds um looking at the first Trump<br>Administration I think a second Trump<br>Administration should have happen will<br>sound bad but it will not be as bad as<br>it sounds there's a lot of<br>catastrophizing um about this around the<br>world there are a couple reasons why<br>um first the American federal system has<br>checks and balances that for people<br>coming up in a Westminster unitary<br>system seem odd but the system was<br>designed by the founding fathers to<br>prevent a king from ever coming back and<br>that's coming in very handy um for<br>example When Donald Trump in 2018 mused<br>in a press conference next to Kim<br>Jong-un about pulling all US troops out<br>of Korea perennial for him um<br>republicans in Congress uh quietly<br>passed legislation saying the president<br>of the United States cannot remove any<br>troops without Congressional approval<br>passed by very very broad um support was<br>introduced by<br>Republicans um uh who were publicly<br>supporting Trump um the Congress<br>controls the P strings the Senate<br>controls confirmation so the checks and<br>balances will be significant um<br>and support for engagement in this part<br>of the world is very broad um you'll<br>hear a lot about the America first<br>movement which is the Trump uh circles<br>um<br>isolationist uh framing it it it's taken<br>from the America first movement uh<br>before World War to when um Lindberg and<br>others argued the US should not be um<br>supporting Britain and France in the war<br>against Germany there were a lot of<br>reasons for it the Great Depression<br>Irish Americans German Americans um some<br>soft support for fascism as<br>conservatives opposed Franklin Delona<br>Roosevelt's new Society but the<br>interesting thing many people Miss is<br>that the America first movement was also<br>an Asia first movement um in Galla<br>polling in 1940 Americans were asked<br>should we go into the war to help<br>Britain and France survive<br>um and two-thirds of Americans said no<br>but further down Gallup asked should we<br>confront Japan in China even if it risks<br>war with Japan and two-thirds of<br>Americans said yes when um NATO was<br>being deaded and the America first<br>movement um post-war variation was<br>opposing NATO um they were arguing that<br>we needed to go hard against communist<br>China and Asia when JD Vance the senator<br>from Ohio who's one of the most magga<br>trumpy senators went to the Munich<br>security conference and told the<br>Europeans you might be on your own we we<br>don't we shouldn't be supporting Ukraine<br>he said it's because we need to Pivot to<br>Asia now as a student of strategy you<br>would know that that's ridiculous you<br>can't pull out of Europe and expect you<br>know as lecoin you said Americans think<br>that foreign policy is like watching a<br>video you can just pause one video take<br>it out put another one in and then<br>resume the earlier like like you'd never<br>stopped um it's ridiculous to think that<br>um pulling support from Ukraine would<br>somehow help uh with strategic<br>objectives in Asia it's cultural but the<br>point I'm trying to make is the support<br>for this part of the world and for<br>engaging in this part of the world is<br>actually quite broad so it's not that<br>the Situation's going to be pleasant if<br>Donald Trump wins it's not that it's<br>going to be calm it's going to be<br>chaotic it's going to be difficult and<br>painful for Americans um as it was last<br>time but there's a lot more continuity<br>in American engagement particularly with<br>the Indo Pacific a lot more continuity<br>than meets the eye um so I'll end with<br>that what should New Zealand do I would<br>say you know when Mark Twain traveled in<br>1895 he um he was asked everywhere what<br>do you think of New Zealand and he kept<br>telling people well I'm I I think it's<br>foolish for a visitor only here for a<br>few weeks to app Pine on a country and<br>then finally he did and if you know the<br>history he commented on two statues from<br>the Maui war and pretty much pissed off<br>everyone in New Zealand so um so I'm<br>going to completely forget that lesson<br>and um Channel my in Mark train but just<br>a few thoughts to leave you with first<br>remember it is a multi-polar Asia uh the<br>agency for Australia or New Zealand is<br>not just through Washington and and<br>Beijing it's through Delhi it's through<br>Tokyo through the Pacific<br>Islands um second um as trosky said you<br>may not be interested in war but war is<br>interested in you um New Zealand's<br>toolkit for statecraft will be very<br>different from Australia's or Amer Amer<br>or Japans or indias but every toolkit's<br>going to have to have some combination<br>of trade diplomacy development and<br>deterrence and resolve um there is not<br>um uh the geographic benefits New<br>Zealand has enjoyed are<br>evaporating um and the toolkits have to<br>be rethought in my view<br>um and democracy matters particularly in<br>the Pacific investing in good governance<br>women's empowerment resilience which New<br>Zealand does well my wife's in the<br>development World long history of Enz at<br>Aid um pays off in the long run um so<br>New Zealand brings tools to this and<br>influence that's there for the U for the<br>using so thank you David look forward to<br>the questions um and very much<br>appreciate the chance to speak to<br>you thanks very much Mike for uh<br>tremendous stimulating and uh time<br>sobering and and perhaps in your<br>analysis of a would be second Trump<br>Administration slightly slightly more<br>comforting uh analysis it's the best I<br>can do the best you can do um I we've<br>got time for a few questions um but<br>before I um so I'll try and catch catch<br>my eye if you've got a question please<br>um but before I do maybe I can just<br>start by one to um to get the the ball<br>rolling and that is um Mike you you P<br>you painted a picture of intense<br>strategic comp comption between the US<br>and China and our our mutual friend<br>Brendan Taylor wrote a book called the<br>four flash points where he worried about<br>the future of war in Asia and he talked<br>about the Sino Indian Border South China<br>Sea the Taiwan Straits and the Korean<br>Peninsula when you think about those<br>four flash points or maybe some other<br>nightmare that hasn't crossed my mind<br>what's the one that keeps you up at<br>night and what do you think can be done<br>to try and manage those those crisis<br>potential crises well it's a it's a<br>smorgasborg of potential crisis in this<br>region right now um uh I worry a lot<br>about North Korea which is developing<br>nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles<br>right now with impunity the the Ukraine<br>war the strategic competition with China<br>has has opened up um freedom of action<br>for Pyongyang I was involved in the<br>six-party talks uh the US uh Japan uh<br>Korea Russia China and North Korea um<br>more often than not um Russia and China<br>were on side they didn't agree with our<br>tactics but they agreed with the<br>nuclearization and keeping some pressure<br>on pongyang that's gone so I worry about<br>an unhindered Kim Jong-un um uh I worry<br>about um to me the Taiwan South China SE<br>senkakus are all part of the same first<br>island chain um mix Wich is Brew which<br>is more dangerous than it has been<br>um in my professional career<br>um um and I worry in particular about um<br>uh I think deterrence still works I<br>think it would be it' be Madness to take<br>on the US Navy um and frankly in a<br>Taiwan contingency one of the big<br>changes in Japan is happening because<br>geographically now um Japan is in a<br>Taiwan<br>contingency um the Japanese islands are<br>70 kilometers from Taiwan and the<br>Chinese military exercises completely<br>enveloped Japan and it's broadly<br>understood in Tokyo so it would be<br>Madness for um for Beijing to take on uh<br>the US uh and Japanese and potentially<br>others um so deterrence works but over<br>the 5 10e Horizon the worrying thing<br>worrying thing to me uh about this is um<br>is that wisdom may not Prevail um the<br>central military commission which makes<br>key decisions of War and Peace and<br>strategy in China has no representative<br>from the foreign Ministry no<br>representative from the economic<br>Ministries no representative from the<br>business community so the decisions in a<br>crisis will be made by people who aren't<br>thinking about economic<br>interdependence and as a student of<br>History I have to be careful to remember<br>that history doesn't repeat it Rhymes<br>but if you're if you read Margaret<br>McMillan's book or the Sleep Walkers or<br>other books about the years leading into<br>World War<br>I the German general staff took over<br>German foreign policy and so German<br>foreign policy was designed to deliver<br>um what the general staff needed to<br>execute the slay plan um and so as a<br>matter of grand strategy it was crazy to<br>attack Belgium because that would bring<br>in Britain and and eventually America<br>but for the general staff which was<br>thinking about Railroad schedules and<br>defeating France before Russia Russia um<br>it made sense so the military logic was<br>dominating foreign policy and I I fear<br>that's happening in China right now<br>um an earlier Chinese<br>government Chinese system that was<br>listening to Scholars like Wang jisa ju<br>Fong um would not be pursuing this Grand<br>strategy um because the strategy is<br>creating the quad creating OAS creating<br>even the Japanese and Koreans are<br>getting along um that's not smart Grand<br>strategy um it's useful frankly for us<br>diplomacy it makes the job easier um but<br>it is worrisome about the lack of<br>feedback and consideration of the<br>consequences um but that's also an<br>opportunity for diplomacy that's why<br>dialogue is important that's why um uh<br>what you do 1.5 track is is incredibly<br>important thanks up<br>there thank you manjit pesi I'm one of<br>David's colleagues here at the center uh<br>thank you for wonderful and very<br>comprehensive historically in-depth talk<br>I guess I my question uh to you is um to<br>do with the broad framing that you had<br>and you mentioned that America's<br>strategy is not about Primacy but about<br>balance and I was wondering if you could<br>explain that uh a little bit because uh<br>China's power is China may not<br>be but I I guess the power Target is a<br>constantly moving one so in such a<br>dynamic configuration how does one<br>actually create and maintain balance so<br>if you could share your thoughts on that<br>thank you one of the I mean it's a<br>really interesting question and uh would<br>make a great um exam question by the<br>way because I certainly don't have the<br>answer but maybe some second year<br>student in your class will um how you<br>measure power is incredibly incredibly<br>difficult um<br>uh Beijing is measuring power<br>differently than how the US measures<br>power right now in many respects so the<br>US is measuring power in terms of um<br>what Scholars call external balancing<br>alignment and the US is doing extremely<br>well on alignment right now um I didn't<br>mention Europe but the um the European<br>position is changing<br>Beijing is not measuring that in the<br>same way it's pretty clear that what<br>Beijing is measuring is when wangi has a<br>meeting and a strategic partnership is<br>announced that that's the that's the<br>stuff that goes into the calculation and<br>is reported to xiin Ping so we're<br>measuring these things differently um<br>the US Australia the UK and Japan and<br>India for that matter although you know<br>thing about OAS is in in Tokyo and Delhi<br>in it has enormous support because the<br>US um submarine capability undee Warfare<br>capability is probably 15 to 20 years<br>ahead of the PLA and so if you want to<br>make it too complicated to think about<br>attacking Taiwan or Japan you maintain<br>that edge that's a lot of what arus is<br>is about um so the US puts a very high<br>emphasis on<br>undersea um but the pla may be putting<br>emphasis on what they call netri Network<br>Centric Warfare attacking nodes<br>satellites and things like that um<br>attacking satellites is a norm that the<br>US or Australia or Japan in particular<br>would not break easily but it's pretty<br>clear from Chinese tests um that there<br>is active consideration of going after<br>satellites so the fact that we measure<br>power differently think about deter<br>differently is really really important<br>um there's a concept called strategic<br>empathy which means you need to really<br>understand how your adversaries are<br>thinking about power and think about<br>what deterrence is because we may think<br>we're brilliant and it may not affect<br>the other side's action so it's a really<br>good question I hope if you ask it let<br>me know what your students come up with<br>it will be better than<br>just yeah thanks so much Mike for that<br>superb um set of remarks thank you so<br>much my question is about India um and<br>whether the partnership that the US is<br>developing with India is an enduring one<br>or whether it's an interest based<br>Alliance that is suiting the here and<br>now and US calculation is such that that<br>here and now is sufficient while India<br>is still developing economic and<br>Military might and so very much still in<br>US favor<br>but India's public polling and<br>perceptions um has pretty mixed view of<br>the US um ja shank's rhetoric to the<br>global South actually has a kind of neoc<br>colonial anti-west sort of message about<br>actually India rising and being um the<br>leader of the global South Sans us I<br>would argue um what's your sort of is is<br>is there a time stamp to this<br>relationship thank you so I I went into<br>the White House having worked mostly on<br>Japan Korea anas um and was eventually<br>put in charge of the wholeo Pacific and<br>suddenly was in charge of a major push<br>to um create a new strategic partnership<br>with India um it was one of the most<br>important things for the new<br>Administration uh Al Gore would have<br>done the same thing because Clinton had<br>tried but the 1998 nuclear test uh<br>interrupted it um so at early on when we<br>were thinking about this new strategic<br>partnership and the US made major<br>legislative changes um including um I<br>was very involved in these negotiations<br>with J Shanker who was my counterpart in<br>the Nea<br>the US you know uh got a peaceful one<br>123 peaceful nuclear agreement with<br>India without India joining the npt that<br>was not easy so the did big things um<br>and we sat around the table once saying<br>are we are we sort of doing this with<br>India the way we did this with China and<br>we may regret it someday and we all kind<br>of looked at each other and we went<br>nah um<br>that's who knows um probably not I would<br>say almost certainly I'm not not um for<br>a couple reasons um yeah there's always<br>the enemy of my enemy is my friend that<br>propelled us China relationships in the<br>Cold War the China Challenge is clearly<br>propelling India's relationship with the<br>US and Japan and Australia and the quad<br>and others that that's true um but I<br>think there's a more fundamental<br>decision that's been made um<br>since vajpai manmon Singh that uh in<br>order to compete with China economically<br>um India needs to um uh be more closely<br>aligned with the leading economic<br>democracies um for quite self-interested<br>reasons um and there's also this um<br>incredible connection you know when Modi<br>goes to the US he does these howdy Modi<br>rallies in Texas and gets there a lot of<br>gujaratis in Texas and the the diaspora<br>is incredibly powerful I when we were<br>trying to get the legislation through<br>Congress for peaceful nuclear<br>cooperation um<br>there was a an India caucus set up and<br>interestingly the America Israel<br>political action caucus helped the<br>Indians set it up because they had<br>decided it's good for Israel if India<br>has good relations with the US um and so<br>they helped them set up what became<br>after APAC the second largest um<br>diaspora you know political caucus in<br>the US Congress very bipartisan and<br>members of Congress wanted to do it<br>because of the diaspora which is very<br>very powerful in the US in Australia you<br>know Modi goes to Australia and it's K<br>Modi I don't know about New Zealand<br>maybe Modi hasn't been New Zealand I<br>don't know so um you got to work on that<br>you need a Gade is taken you need<br>something the Kiora Modi or something um<br>so that diaspora that that connection is<br>very very important um you talked about<br>polling but in uh polling that's not<br>usually published<br>um among Hindus in isia in India because<br>they only only don't put religion when<br>they produce the polls but the times of<br>India and the Hindustan times usually<br>know the US has almost 90%<br>favorability um so I think there's a lot<br>more to it but I remember I used to not<br>tell the story but I think it's okay now<br>uh we had a meeting with a very senior<br>Chinese official uh in 2005 um after we<br>begun this new strategic partnership<br>with India um and uh this Chinese<br>official said we've studied the US India<br>relationship and we've concluded that no<br>matter what China does the forces of<br>History will push India in the United<br>States closer and closer and then he<br>hesitated and he said but it's India so<br>you will be very frustrated and the most<br>recent example is the Washington Post<br>headline today detailing the research<br>and Analysis when the Intel Services<br>plots to assassinate American citizens<br>of seek descent the way they killed a<br>Canadian that is not good as they say in<br>political science um and yet I think the<br>relationship the relationship is going<br>to keep moving forward yeah I think it<br>is all right we're pushing our luck with<br>time but I no no no I'm so no uh we have<br>certainly have one more time for this<br>Simon you need to ask the gentleman next<br>to<br>you um but<br>uh gosh I mean it my own view is um that<br>if um Lea Chong had become leader of<br>China you would not be seeing the same<br>thing thing my own view is it's very<br>particular to xiin Ping and she's um uh<br>own uh lived experience in the cultural<br>revolution um most of his generation<br>came out of the cultural<br>revolution um despising Mau ISM and and<br>mass you know Revolution and<br>Chaos she came out of it<br>despising ever losing power um I don't<br>think most China Scholars caught that<br>including scholars in China and so his<br>worldview is very aligned with on a<br>personal level with Putin's I think and<br>um uh and so I I'm I'm I don't uh this<br>is not uh a No Limits this not the<br>special relationship between the US and<br>UK it's not the US toan Alliance this is<br>not it's not it's not bounded by the<br>same common values and interests it's<br>it's in my view very particular to she<br>and to Putin but they will be around for<br>probably 5 10 15 who knows how many<br>years<br>so we I do not think there is an easy<br>wedge between Beijing and Moscow but I<br>also don't think we need to assume that<br>this is a relationship that lasts a<br>Generation Um and we need to exploit<br>opportunities when they<br>come I'll check with in later to see if<br>I got that<br>right well look um ladies and gentlemen<br>I'm afraid uh time has raced by as they<br>say and I'm afraid
