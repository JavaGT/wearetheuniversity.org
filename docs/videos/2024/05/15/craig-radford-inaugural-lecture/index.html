He also discusses how anthrophony interferes with the natural biology and ecology of marine animals that rely on sound, which is a pressing issue worldwide and analogous to climate change and plastic pollution.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Koto I'm John hosking Dean of science<br>here at the University of ockland by<br>Papa Tomo and it's a great pleasure to<br>welcome you to the inaugural lecture of<br>Professor Craig<br>Redford<br>Craig Craig was born in taranaki and<br>spent many holidays as a kid in on or<br>near the the ocean mainly with<br>grandfather on the tanaki coast knows<br>his Fascination and love the ocean to<br>him he started his university studies<br>with a BSC in biology from W Masters in<br>Zoology from Canterbury worked as a<br>technician at Massie before doing a PhD<br>here at Oakland in Marine Science he was<br>clearly looking for the right Super<br>follow after a couple of posts here he<br>became a senior lecturer and associate<br>professor and now a professor which<br>we're celebrating<br>tonight Craig works in Marine Science in<br>particular he is a sensory ecologist who<br>specializes in how marine animals hear<br>and utilize sound and how those animals<br>are affected by human generated sound<br>many marine animals such as mammals fish<br>and Crustaceans rely on sound for<br>successful life history strategies from<br>mate selection and finding food to sound<br>providing a queue for selecting a place<br>to<br>live Craig uses a multi-disciplinary<br>approach including physics physiology<br>and behavior to tackle some of his<br>important research questions tonight he<br>will describe some of the highlights of<br>his academic journey to date Craig the<br>yours it's uh kind of funny I can stand<br>up here and give a lecture and not be<br>nervous but<br>um I'm shaking tonight uh so this is a<br>motto that I've used um many a time for<br>many a funding um application and uh I<br>think it's a classic one that uh<br>everyone can relate to and um tonight<br>I'm going to dispel that so straight to<br>the punch line<br>so in between my breath here diving um<br>you can hear the clicks of these little<br>fish and these are not the only animals<br>that um make sound in our oceans but<br>it's clearly a noisy place and uh Jac<br>CAU famous explorer got this um wrong so<br>I thought I'd get to the punch line<br>first um before I bore you with a whole<br>lot of um other<br>stuff so where did it all start well um<br>in High School uh I watched the Top Gun<br>movie and all I wanted to be was<br>Maverick and five fighter<br>jets so uh I applied to the Air Force<br>and I'll get to that but in the reality<br>I went from the sky to underwater and um<br>that's kind of where I spend a lot of my<br>time um now well not so much now but I<br>did when I was able to get out<br>there uh so growing up<br>I as as John mentioned I spent a lot of<br>time on the coast down in taranaki this<br>is one of our uh family camping trips my<br>mom's here uh that's me um trying to get<br>a suntan and all my cousins and my uncle<br>uh my grandfather's not in this picture<br>but um spent a lot of time fishing I'm<br>not I'm not too proud of this now that<br>I've um embarked on the career that I<br>have uh but uh these these blue sharks<br>were eating out of our Burly pot and<br>eating the Snapper that we're pulling up<br>and uh we hooked them and they got their<br>Comm commutant unfortunately so uh<br>that's something I'm not too proud of<br>and again not not too much has changed I<br>still spend a lot of time out on the<br>water um and I still work on sharks and<br>I still have um sharks but Le Leist they<br>gone to the good of science these ones<br>actually come from the tuna long L<br>fishery so I'm making use to the by<br>catch of of animals that have already<br>sacrificed so uh as John mentioned my<br>grandfather so this is this is him in<br>the middle here uh that's me very young<br>young dad that's four four<br>generations uh my dad here on on on the<br>on my left uh grandfather in the middle<br>uh me and my son n who's here<br>today um and<br>uh it it's it's strange things happen<br>cuz cuz of the trajectory I had when I<br>was at high school and wanting to be in<br>the Air Force I actually applied I got<br>in and for some reason I never went and<br>uh it wasn't at all my grandfather<br>passed away probably 8 years ago now<br>that um I was it was a nice I got the<br>phone call from my parents and it was a<br>nice day and I went went and sat out on<br>the deck at Lee and I I just kind of<br>contemplated things and that's when it<br>suddenly hit me with with with thinking<br>about him and the times I had with him<br>and being being you know on the banks of<br>the urui river down in taranaki um white<br>baiting the oniro river Mo aino all<br>those Rivers trying to catch white bait<br>um out on the boat catching fish and<br>it's and it's in those moments that you<br>realize how much a person kind of<br>inflicts on your life and and kind of<br>what you get um out of that so um yeah<br>so I owe a lot of my love for the ocean<br>to to Granddad um and um I thank him for<br>that so um as I mentioned um Noah he's<br>he's he's only about six no two months<br>old there he's now turned into<br>this<br>uh he he thinks and my good friend Sean<br>and Maria I think they were there that<br>night he he thinks he can keep keep up<br>um this is six months later when he when<br>he thought he thought he thought he'd<br>got a bit better and could do it<br>again uh in terms of my career I I owe a<br>huge amount to um these three gentlemen<br>here um and specifically um Andrew and<br>John<br>um I was doing my masters at canbury and<br>that's where I first met Andrew was<br>supplying me with lobsters I was doing a<br>bit of physiology respiration physiology<br>on them and I'd started at U Messi<br>university and I was working at the vet<br>school Under John's predecessor actually<br>um Grant Guilford and I was doing a lot<br>of horrible things to large animals um<br>you can imagine what what goes on down<br>down at the vet school and I I was kind<br>of sick of it and I wanted to get get<br>back to my love um of marine animals and<br>I just emailed Andrew out of the blue to<br>to see what he had on offer and he had<br>this underwater sound project which a<br>student had just bailed on them so I was<br>like underwat sound knew nothing about<br>it didn't let them know anything about<br>that but I was like yeah keen and<br>um and they took a huge gamble right I<br>just had I had a little baby um and uh<br>embarked on this journey um on a PhD<br>with them and I owe them a huge amount<br>and they've been a great support uh<br>throughout my<br>career and um we I'd like to think while<br>I know we're we're good friends today<br>and it's great to have you you both here<br>and this other person here is Chris<br>Tindle um he was h of physics at the<br>time so he had the pleasure of teaching<br>a biologist<br>physics um and he was a very patient man<br>I he I actually I learned a huge amount<br>of him and um he was a huge huge reason<br>why the project that we embarked on um<br>with this was a was a success these<br>actually a couple of pictures um this<br>one was um at a raw soci side event um I<br>I won an award so we got to dress up in<br>um penguin suits and um go to this fancy<br>dinner um for which we all received our<br>Awards and this is a an image from<br>Lizard Island where um Andrew and Jenny<br>and I spent a bit of<br>time and um Andrew I think Jenny took<br>this photo she sent it to me today so I<br>surprised um so how do you know you've<br>made it so I don't know where I received<br>this picture from I'm not sure if you<br>sent it to me John or whether it was<br>Dave bodnik but um might have been not<br>popular even but um I had it on my<br>computer and I was like and when I was<br>when I was thinking about about uh the<br>presentation and and what to um present<br>today so this is this is an image was it<br>moat or was it scripts do you<br>remember go<br>back but uh um this was the who's who<br>basically of um the hearing world and<br>Century ecology and um fish uh there's a<br>there's a young strapping um John<br>Montgomery I think this is 19 must have<br>been 1988 that<br>there was a book I think you guys part<br>of and um there's a whole lot of other<br>people so when you start to be invited<br>to retirement events as kind of young<br>well not John's not so young there but<br>um young upand cominging scientists<br>instead of um I think that's when you<br>know you made it and there's a whole<br>bunch of these people who who are a lot<br>older um in this picture here um<br>including this gentleman here um bill I<br>think he was about 92 and um he was this<br>wasn't a retirement event for art popper<br>who's had three more retirement events<br>since since this one and I was in a<br>meeting with him the other day and he<br>actually said this is his last year but<br>year so My collaborators they're a huge<br>part of where where're where I'm at and<br>what what we've accomplished together I<br>say we because it's a collective it's<br>not it's just not me um working alone um<br>I'm I I first met<br>Dennis uh back in 2009 so Dennis is I'm<br>this guy here this was actually taken<br>recently so we're still working together<br>um out out on the gulf<br>and my my track to where I where I got<br>was a little bit unusual in that my<br>personal life kind of dictated that I<br>needed to stay in New Zealand and not<br>embark on the big you know postto<br>Adventure that most people did so I was<br>lucky enough that I I could I won a few<br>fellowships that allowed me to go um<br>overseas to work with some um very cool<br>people who are um good mates of mine now<br>and um we still do a lot of work<br>together so Dennis and I met 2009 he and<br>Al I met and so Dennis is from the<br>middle of Canada strange to have a<br>marine scientist in the middle of Canada<br>but there you go and Al who's um he's in<br>the middle of America but um he does a<br>lot of work in wood so so I've spent a<br>lot of time up there um with our and<br>they've basically taught me all all I<br>need to know about the physiology um<br>work that we do<br>now and then Cara who um actually we did<br>our phds together under John's chage and<br>um we were lucky enough to um to secure<br>a Marsden together a few years ago which<br>allowed us to embark on a sh heing<br>project which was um a great success<br>which I'll present some um stuff from<br>that a little bit further on and then<br>more locally um I work with these<br>wonderful women um Michelle I was<br>thinking about this today when I was<br>kind of preparing I I think it's about<br>10 years now we've been wherever she is<br>we've been um working together and um I<br>actually my first PhD student as a as<br>the primary supervisor with was with<br>relle as as the co-supervisor and we've<br>done a lot of cool stuff and more<br>recently um with Fred and Jamie again uh<br>lucky enough to secure masden and we're<br>doing some pretty cool stuff at the<br>moment on crustation hearing and then<br>there's Rachel who's<br>um trying to while we're trying to<br>embark on combining Acoustics and<br>statistics which is um no easy feat but<br>it's going to lead to some pretty cool<br>going and then I I don't think the the<br>the technicians and stuff get enough<br>credit for um the amount of work that<br>they put in and help us with and<br>particularly with with our students and<br>what we actually do at Lee and I don't<br>have pictures of many of them but I do<br>have this picture recently John John<br>Atkins who's who's no longer with us but<br>meant I meant no longer at Lee<br>Willis but<br>um uh and Jimmy um you know Brady um the<br>workshop guys U Murray uh I'm sure Jimmy<br>always rolls his eyes when I walk into<br>his office because um I come up with<br>some crazy ideas and these guys always<br>come up with ways in which we can um can<br>do those crazy ideas so um without their<br>help is um I wouldn't be able to do half<br>the things I do and particularly John<br>right John John has kind of Revel well<br>he he hasn't kind of he has he's he's<br>reev revolutionalized um how we record<br>sound underwater and you know this is an<br>example of what I did my PhD with these<br>old homemade jobs where we kind of put<br>an acoustic recorder and what we thought<br>was a waterproof container and um you<br>know electronics and water don't go hand<br>inand so uh John has been has is a real<br>um genius and we've gone from these<br>types of devices to really nice uh<br>affordable um very capable instruments<br>it's just another example here's Brady<br>this is the old um Hoy you know we we've<br>got these monstrous devices um that I<br>was do my PhD with we actually had this<br>was a computer that we waterproofed and<br>some canisters and we we recording and<br>this is the type of system that was<br>doing the same job now so without<br>without this expert capabilities we<br>wouldn't I wouldn't be able to do half<br>the stuff that um I've actually been<br>do and then just getting to the last of<br>my thanks and then I'll get into a bit<br>of the<br>science goes to the many students that<br>have been working with us<br>um Jenny was I'd actually just got back<br>from the UK I'd this was back when we<br>got about $6,000 to hand in thesis on<br>time which I thought was very generous<br>of the University so it funded me a a<br>4mon trip to um Europe and um so I I<br>then got a got an email from John saying<br>that we' we' got some money and I then<br>had a<br>postto and um so I come back and Andrew<br>had organized um Jenny for us um unknown<br>to me so Jenny was the first student<br>that I um co-supervised with Andrew and<br>this man here sha um was the first one I<br>co-supervised with John and then Ros<br>here was U my first as a primary um<br>supervisor uh with relle as the<br>co-supervisor and then um we all had the<br>dread dreaded um co co Zoom meetings um<br>these are a few of the student St that<br>suffered through that who have all gone<br>on to um graduate or nearly graduate and<br>um they they they coped and we um they<br>did a wonderful job with um what they<br>did and then all of a sudden you you get<br>a bit older and you start meeting them<br>at meetings and uh this is one that I<br>don't know what happened to my hair<br>and but um uh this was in in the<br>Netherlands and um mat was another<br>student like co-supervised with Andrew<br>but um it's good to see when you start<br>and then all of a sudden your students<br>evolve and and they also embark on their<br>own<br>careers so the science so our world is<br>getting noisier um we know that um soon<br>as we step outside here we hear the um<br>traffic outside um we go to the airport<br>you hear planes fling flying around you<br>go near factories um rush hour it it's a<br>welln fact that the world is getting<br>noisier and this is the same thing<br>underwater we're starting to explore the<br>ocean more trying to take advantage of<br>it to harness its energy but all all the<br>all the all our man-made advances um in<br>the ocean are actually creating noise<br>which can have tremendous effects on the<br>animals that live there and it's only<br>really recently um and I say recently<br>the last kind of 40 years that um we've<br>begun to understand how important sound<br>is to um animals outside the marine<br>mammals I'm talking about the fish and<br>the um little crustations and the<br>invertebrates and that becomes a problem<br>when you understand the biology of the<br>animal and the ecology when it comes to<br>sound and if we put noise in into their<br>world all of a sudden they've got to<br>find ways to do with it where um they<br>that so one of the my my key question um<br>that I we what my group does is to<br>understand the effects of noise on<br>Aquatic Life um I work I got dragged<br>into the Marine Mammal world with<br>relle um so we do do some I do some<br>stuff on that but my main animals are<br>the fish and the crustation<br>and um I take a three-prong approach<br>with that I try and understand the<br>physics and before we can even<br>understand<br>um what the animals use to sound for we<br>need to understand what the acoustic<br>environment um sounds like that the<br>animals are living in so so to do that<br>we we understand the soundscapes by<br>soundscape I mean um just the ambient<br>noise around the animals that they<br>they're focusing on every day we want to<br>understand who makes those sounds and<br>then we also want to understand how that<br>sound propagates because that's going to<br>be<br>different um depending on a lot of<br>different um<br>things and then we need to understand<br>the the physiology and morphology what<br>what are the sound um detection<br>structures in these animals um how<br>sensitive are they and then lastly we're<br>interested in the behav behavior in the<br>ecology so what types of behaviors are<br>Med mediated by these sounds what are<br>they using these sounds um<br>for so now I've just got a a few<br>examples<br>of uh different aspects of this um these<br>questions and that we've been<br>tackling so starting with the Acoustics<br>I've been lucky enough to um record from<br>many many different locations around the<br>world and these are just just this is<br>just an example of uh where I have um<br>recordings from so obviously I've got a<br>bunch around around here from New<br>Zealand um basically from the kermc<br>islands right down to um Campbell Island<br>not so many around Australia but um up<br>on the gbr on the great be Reef I was<br>lucky enough to go to Malaysia with with<br>sha so we did a bunch there and then<br>just through through my collaborations<br>around the rest of the world so we have<br>a pretty good<br>of a pretty good record of you know many<br>aspects of um what the underwater<br>environment um sounds like even up in um<br>Canada so this is I spend a lot of time<br>well I used to now it's with my students<br>but we spend a lot of time just<br>listening to the Ambi environment and<br>trying to figure out what is um this is<br>so low does it pop up<br>um so this is a a recording that um Lucy<br>actually put together vanram um of of uh<br>rangit tahua the kmex uh these are just<br>some examples of an example of what the<br>ambient environment um sounds like up<br>so we actually know that those fish<br>produce those sounds<br>so you could understand that um that was<br>just a whole lot of recordings um put<br>together that wasn't just one recording<br>that we had all these sounds in so you<br>can spend a lot of time just listening<br>to to the ambient crackle um of what's<br>happening and a lot of the time we don't<br>actually know what is producing um those<br>sounds we here in here in um temperate<br>environments we only know a small<br>fraction of the animals that could<br>potentially produce those sounds and a<br>lot of the stuff that we hear like in<br>those examples there there was only one<br>particular fish that we think produced<br>that sound and that was because it was<br>similar to a species that we know of<br>here the big eye there's a um species<br>that are very similar up there so we're<br>just making an assumption that it's that<br>but without without the proof of<br>recording The Sounds in a<br>tank um it's very hard to attribute<br>specific sounds to um specific um<br>animals without without that<br>proof so we do a lot of guess play um<br>guess that animal sound<br>so I've got a few recordings here um<br>Andrew and John and Jenny might might<br>know these SN but um see if see you can<br>Gard I think I heard it John Dory<br>one where Ashley<br>it's um our native petal crab so these<br>guys<br>are this was a pretty this is a pretty<br>cool story actually so we had a bunch of<br>these I think Tony hickey used to run a<br>lab with them and um I think we we had a<br>there were a bunch in a tank at Lee and<br>Ashley was actually down there one day<br>and she heard this heard this sound she<br>wasn't actually going to work on this<br>but um we're like she was like hey these<br>crabs are making these crazy sounds so<br>we're like let's and we jumped on it um<br>so they make this sound as an<br>aggressive um an aggressive movement<br>towards a mating pier and it's it's made<br>by a male crab trying to trying to get<br>uh a receptive female off off another<br>male that's already um claimed<br>so you probably don't know this one this<br>is a toad fish so this is a a fish that<br>I work on um in the US and there's<br>several different species um around<br>there but um there was a a famous story<br>in the San Francisco times where these<br>guys were actually keeping um house<br>booat owners up during the summer months<br>because they can they can produce this<br>sound for hours on end um we've had one<br>in a tank go for an hour and a half just<br>and it's uh it's a um and what they're<br>doing with the sound is they're trying<br>to attract um a female into into the<br>nest um to lay EDS so they can um<br>fertilize<br>them so this is another probably not<br>many of know this this two spot deazel<br>so um we're not sure why they produce<br>this sound but um it's it's quite a<br>G so um that's that's SP Lobster um<br>we're pretty sure that that's produced<br>by the gastric teeth in the<br>here so that's the sea<br>urchin so these guys are responsible for<br>um the huge Dawn and dust chorus that we<br>hear um on our temperate<br>reefs so you can imagine a lot of what<br>what happens is there's a lot of guest<br>work and we hear lots of funky sounds<br>and it's quite ser lip us about how we<br>figure out what animals are actually<br>producing those<br>sounds how does how do boats influence<br>um the soundscape so this this is some<br>work by Louise Wilson and um what we<br>were trying to do is it's it's really<br>it's it's a lot easier to understand how<br>large ships produce sounds they have<br>tracking systems in them and we can<br>track where they go and we know um where<br>we record and what time they come past<br>but what we don't know is about small<br>recreational boats and this becomes<br>important for for places like the Hier<br>golf who um we you know pretty much one<br>in I'd guess one and 10 people in<br>Oakland own a boat they're always out on<br>the gulf and all of a sudden you've got<br>uh rush hour traffic on a nice sunny day<br>um<br>underwater and what we were trying to do<br>is what she was trying to do is<br>understand what that contribution and<br>noise was um by these boats so these<br>figures here<br>this is just frequency on the x-axis um<br>intensity level on the y- AIS the um my<br>right hand side is um spectr profiles of<br>um locations with boats and this is the<br>same location without the boats and you<br>can just visually see what the boats do<br>to that soundscape this the low<br>frequency kind of below 1,000 Herz is<br>where all that where the large majority<br>of the fish and crustations make sound<br>from what you just heard and and you can<br>see that the the the frequency that the<br>boats produce are in that same band and<br>increase that um part of the<br>soundscape and that becomes um important<br>in terms of masking these boats are<br>producing sound in the same frequency<br>band therefore it's going to make the<br>animals uh a lot harder for the animals<br>to Comm to communicate you can think of<br>it more as as the cocktail party effect<br>if you like if you're at a at a at a<br>good party and it's loud you have to be<br>closer together in order to talk to each<br>other compared to if say you're at a<br>boring party and it's not so fun then<br>you can kind of yell at each other from<br>room um moving into the physiology um<br>aspect of of this uh a lot of the work<br>that we've done is looking at at the<br>hearing structures and looking at the<br>variation that we um have Within<br>different um animal<br>groups and a lot of this um requires um<br>collecting um dead animals and that's<br>where where the um Fisheries becomes<br>really uh quite quite a good source for<br>us because we can go there and we can<br>collect um lots of B catch animals as<br>long as they um know we need them<br>they're they're very good at keeping and<br>keeping them on ice so we can um<br>actually use them so this is some work<br>that Derek s did<br>uh and this is was with the coll<br>collaboration with Cara we were looking<br>at um the ears of um sharks so here<br>we've got six different<br>species uh we got skull shark uh smooth<br>hound or rig so this is the typical one<br>you get in fish and chips uh that's moo<br>uh Hammerhead a carpet shark and then a<br>thresher Shar and you can just see by<br>just looking at those structures there<br>is a markable amount of variation in<br>this the um shape of these um structures<br>which might then relate back to um their<br>ability to<br>hear um these are just gross<br>dissections um when you pull these<br>things out of the head you don't really<br>know the the orientation of of them um<br>in the head and that's where we took<br>advantage of um medical um Imaging here<br>we have on on my left we've got some MRI<br>imaging so mag magnetic resonant Imaging<br>of four species and and this this<br>technology allows us to put the the<br>entire head into the scanner and we can<br>um image the air in situ and then we can<br>make reconstructions so we actually know<br>the actual orientation um inside the<br>animals<br>head and something that we're working on<br>um now um with with Lil and anara is<br>using<br>microct um Imaging where it provides a<br>much higher resolution and we can get<br>some um pretty cool images uh this is a<br>a recent one that Lil did of a<br>hammerhead uh you can see uh the brain<br>here the big optic nerve going out to<br>the eye and this is the air um here so<br>by doing this we can then um co-register<br>so we can combine the MRI and the<br>microct images and we can get a much<br>more detailed image of uh what how the<br>ears are situation in the head and what<br>they actually look like and then we can<br>start doing some modeling on this to see<br>Fields we're also doing similar things<br>with um crustations uh this is a um<br>snapping shrimp brain and you can see<br>that we can get some quite good detail<br>um out so this is off the press this is<br>just recently done we've just recently<br>submitted the paper and um we can<br>reconstruct the different structures and<br>work out what they look like and what<br>that might influence with their um<br>sensory<br>systems then we're also looking at how<br>how well they can actually hear we know<br>they have the sensory<br>structures um we know that they can um<br>detect sound because there's a lot of an<br>toal evidence that um different species<br>respond to um<br>sound and so we set up these um what we<br>call auditory voke potentials so this is<br>a technique that was used is still used<br>on infants so it's a technique that was<br>used in uh Medical Science where<br>basically just put little electrodes on<br>the head play the sounds and then you<br>can measure what the brain is responding<br>to so this is a setup that um Carolyn<br>made<br>um for looking at um sharks and just<br>have a speaker you have the animal um<br>Tethered to some device you have the<br>electrodes um on their head and you can<br>play different sounds and you can<br>measure the brain so where you start to<br>see what we term uh an auditory<br>threshold is the first time you start to<br>see a response in the brain wave so here<br>we're going from um down the bottom here<br>we're going from low frequency to high<br>frequency and you can see as the sound<br>gets louder you start to see response um<br>from the brain and where you first start<br>to see this is what we term our auditory<br>threshold so we've been able to do this<br>for a range of<br>animals um these are some<br>audiograms um from from sharks we got<br>sound pressure level on the y axis here<br>just frequency across the X and three<br>different species don't worry about the<br>different lines but what what this is<br>showing is that the different species<br>they have the same similar shape in<br>terms of this classic um U shape um but<br>the bandwidth that which they hear over<br>is um different and this could be<br>related back to um the morphology of the<br>um hair structures we have some other<br>information associated with this that I<br>haven't presented um in terms of hair<br>cells so there's lots of coret that we<br>can kind of figure out to why we're<br>starting to see why we see these big<br>variations in um hearing structures<br>within um within just these three groups<br>of um<br>sharks we've also been able to record<br>from um crabs again this is just uh an<br>information slide don't worry too much<br>about the lines but that you can just<br>see from the shapes and the bandwidth<br>that just between these four different<br>species of crabs that there's a huge<br>amount of variability in there and and<br>what they can actually hear and how<br>sensitive they are to um sound<br>so moving into the the the<br>behavior we know that um you know we<br>know we know a bit about the underwater<br>soundscape we know um how well and the<br>Machinery that the animals use to hear<br>but what what does that mean for the<br>behavior and the Ecology of the animal<br>so this is um some work uh Lucy vanram<br>did for MSC looking at big eyes so this<br>is kind of my model organism here we<br>know a lot about the big eye we know how<br>well they hear we know about the sounds<br>that they produce but um Lucy come on<br>board and she wanted to find out what<br>that sound is used for these particular<br>fish plantor they live in caves during<br>the day as I showed in that first um<br>image and then they come out on top of<br>the reef at night um to feed so we were<br>thinking that uh maybe this is used as a<br>contact call so a contact call is<br>something that animals use to maintain<br>um group cohesion you know monkeys use<br>them when they're scrambling around in<br>the trees elephants use them um Dolphins<br>um some species of whales and it it's a<br>behavior that's um quite often<br>associated with um high order<br>vertebrates and and mammals so we we<br>were thinking maybe this is something<br>that evolved early on in in the fish and<br>and it had been proposed before and and<br>we were like well let's give a crack so<br>we went out got a bunch of fish put them<br>in tanks and uh you can see we have a<br>little speaker down here here's our um<br>sound trap hydrophone and what we were<br>doing is the the fish were behavor<br>behaving as naturally as they could in<br>the tanks they were producing sound and<br>all we did was we made that environment<br>louder and we watched what happened to<br>the school of<br>fish um if if our um hypothesis was<br>right and that they are using it as a<br>contact call soon as we turn the sound<br>on you would see that the scho of fish<br>would get smaller um they would be<br>closer together because it's noisier<br>they need to be closer together in order<br>to be<br>heard and here are a couple of the<br>photos that we took and you can see that<br>when the sound is off I've just put a<br>polygon around this and you can see that<br>the school is quite spread apart you<br>turn the sound on and all of a sudden<br>they become tighter<br>together so so um what we did there was<br>we basically provided the first first<br>evidence um that the contact calls were<br>used um in in early uh vertebrate um<br>animals this is some more recent work<br>that um Sophie's currently doing for um<br>her MSC is we're interested in this<br>black angel fish um I've been interested<br>in for a while we know that they produce<br>sound um they have this very cool<br>Behavior where this is this is a nest<br>this is a male fish uh these are a bunch<br>of eggs so the female comes in lays lays<br>the eggs in this nest and the male then<br>fertiliz fertilizes them and we wanted<br>to I was interested in what what they're<br>using the sound for cuz quite often when<br>you go diving you swim up to these guys<br>and they'll swim at you and they make<br>make their sound so we it's some type of<br>anti- um scare tactic well some type of<br>scare tactic to shoe fish and if You<br>observe them they chase a lot of fish<br>away from their nest to stop them eating<br>the eggs and we thought maybe it's also<br>used in um reproductive<br>contexts can't find the play button here<br>here we<br>go so here's a female coming in they do<br>a little dance and then in this<br>particular example he chases her off so<br>um there are other examples that that we<br>have where um the female though do that<br>little dance thing side by side that<br>little wiggle the male will produce the<br>sound and then the female will start to<br>um lay eggs on the<br>nest so that's the third part of part of<br>the story so then how does um noise<br>affect um<br>animals it can affect animals in<br>different<br>ways um and in this cartoon here um if<br>it's very loud so so we've got two<br>variables we got decreasing Source level<br>so the um sound gets quieter and then we<br>got an increasing distance from the um<br>source so effectively the sound gets<br>quieter cuz you move further away if the<br>fish is really close to the source and<br>it's really loud it it can have<br>potential um injury and and some<br>sometimes that injury is um death and<br>then there's potential effects on their<br>hearing as you get further away as the<br>sound gets less<br>where you can have um permanent<br>threshold shifts pts or you can have<br>temporary threshold shifts temporary<br>threshold shifts means you're hearing<br>returns and this is kind of this outside<br>area is where I'm more interested in how<br>does this affect um the behavior of the<br>animal and how does this disrupt um<br>their communication um by<br>masking so by understanding um what what<br>the soundscape sounds sounds like<br>understanding their hearing abilities<br>and then understanding their behavior we<br>can start to um combine these three<br>things and make some inferences and do<br>some modeling to figure out how that<br>might affect their<br>um their their active listening space if<br>you like so this is this is an example<br>from Ros where she's working with the<br>large ships um don't worry too much<br>about this I got a summary cartoon in a<br>sec but this is basically as the the<br>ship approaches are these lines at the<br>top and this is what the sound profile<br>of the ambient environment does so as<br>the ship approaches gets to its closest<br>point and it gets<br>loud so what we do with with the<br>modeling um through we can model the<br>propagation of that sound um and we can<br>include in in our model the Heering<br>ability and then we can work out how<br>that sound might affect um these<br>particular animals as the ship<br>approaches<br>we're using two examples uh we got a wi<br>uh a Marine Mammal example in the form<br>of a Brutus well and then we've got our<br>big eye fish example here so we<br>obviously don't have hearing um data<br>from the Brutus Welles but there is some<br>modeled data about how well um what<br>their potential hearing um could be you<br>add in the well you add in the ship<br>information and what we have up here is<br>um what their um communication space or<br>listening space is without any um ship<br>sound and you can see the size of the<br>circle is represented of the distance<br>that they could um detect that sound<br>over you add the ship in and you can see<br>that um the communication space shrinks<br>down to a really small difference and<br>our modeling of of of this scenario<br>suggests that the um 99% of the<br>communication space can be lost as this<br>significant uh more recently we've been<br>interested in in the small boats uh this<br>is um going back to Louisa's stuff uh<br>what we have here is um Goat Island we<br>got two different scenarios we got<br>daytime and we got<br>nighttime uh so what we um did here we<br>did similar situation where we model<br>modeled the sound field we um we using<br>the big eye fish here as our model<br>organism we know about the um their<br>Heering ability and we know about the<br>soundscape uh uh in this environment<br>during the day um Goat Island has has<br>gotten really um noisy and that's<br>because of the fish making the sound and<br>there's lots of biological activity<br>during the day as as accompanied by um<br>the boats at night time the boats tend<br>to<br>disappear and our ambient environment<br>gets quieter so what you're seeing here<br>is um that the effect on the listening<br>space because our because our ambient<br>environment is louder during the day we<br>don't have such a decrease in the active<br>listening space of these animals during<br>the day because the environment's<br>already loud what we're seeing here is a<br>big effect during the night because the<br>ambient environment is quieter any<br>particular noise that comes in there is<br>going to have a greater effect at reduc<br>in the um ambient space of these animals<br>um during this time and that's<br>particularly important for the big ey<br>right because as I mentioned these guys<br>are uh plank devores they come out and<br>they and they feed at night and they're<br>most active at night and the their<br>communication space is going to be<br>significantly affected at Night by um<br>boats coming into um this particular<br>habitat as opposed to um during the day<br>when they're in the caves and they're<br>not um particularly interested in um<br>outside so when we combine all the all<br>this information and and I think that's<br>the beauty of um this multidisciplinary<br>approach is that when you combine them<br>all you can get a really good<br>overarching story about the potential<br>effects we're not just looking at one<br>isolated instance or one isolated effect<br>on a particular variable we're combining<br>difference so enough of the science so<br>the things I've learned um I as I just<br>mentioned this multidisciplinary<br>approach is um what I think is critical<br>because you're combining different<br>Frameworks you're not just getting<br>isolated in in a particular aspect and<br>you're getting more of uh holistic<br>um understanding of what's actually<br>happening to these animal and um teamw<br>work Teamwork Makes for DreamWork um<br>without my<br>collaborators and um and and the various<br>people that I work with n as I said at<br>the start none of this would have been<br>possible something that I've learned<br>more recently is that talking to<br>different people who um see things<br>differently to what um you do so more<br>recently I've taken advantage of of the<br>friendships I've made with with some of<br>the local Fishers and talking to them<br>about what they what they see when<br>they're out on the water every day um<br>these guys and and ladies have a real<br>understanding because they're out there<br>every day they have a real understanding<br>of what actually could be potentially<br>happening and they're seeing Real World<br>um<br>problems and more importantly it's about<br>it's not about us and it's about the<br>environment and the animals quite often<br>we get caught up thinking about how how<br>is this going to affect us when really<br>it's not what's how it's going to affect<br>us it's how it's going to affect the<br>animals and the environment in which um<br>they live<br>in and lastly um to wrap it up I just<br>want to thanks um say thanks to the<br>amazing many amazing people that um I've<br>had the chance to work with the cool<br>animals that um I've had the opportunity<br>to work with and<br>um to the people that I still am working</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
