Business<br>Leaders business New Zealand chief<br>executive Kirk hope has gone from<br>strength to strength with a career and<br>business advocacy since a start in life<br>as a rural atago boy from tidy<br>mouth in 1995 he graduated from the<br>University of atago with a Bachelor of<br>Arts in political science<br>after which he went on to achieve a law<br>degree and an honors degree in political<br>science at Victoria<br>University we'd like to think he took a<br>little bit of the ataro spirit with him<br>when he managed to link one of his<br>papers at Victoria to his love of<br>Surfing by writing a paper on the<br>international political economy of<br>surfing while completing his studies<br>Kirk's career took off with 5 years<br>working in senior positions at westek<br>which which led to a role is executive<br>director of the financial services<br>Association the industry body<br>representing the non-bank sector from<br>there Kirk became chief executive of the<br>New Zealand Bankers Association before<br>taking on his current role as leader of<br>New Zealand's largest business advocacy<br>group working to ensure New Zealand's<br>Success Through sustainable economic<br>growth no<br>Kirk k please join me in welcoming Kirk<br>ration K thanks uh Stephen always<br>entertaining when your former papers are<br>thrown back at you the

loose and cheer whistle<br>and clap for these guys right let's go<br>right that's taking up a minute I've<br>only got eight so right we better get on<br>with it um I think when I was sitting<br>down there in in 1995 the first thing I<br>said to my mom after I got up uh uh<br>getting my cap I said Mom mom I've made<br>it 29 years later mom I've made<br>it Teno Teno<br>otoa uh it's my great pleasure to be<br>with you at this graduation ceremony uh<br>where the finest of gradu are receiving<br>their degrees and diplomas from this<br>most celebrated<br>University uh I as I said I I received<br>my bachelor's degree a very long time<br>ago from atago University my first Elma<br>Mata uh which I remember fondly and it's<br>uh great to be back here today<br>um Kimo K TOA Nu anaho it's good to be<br>home especially it's especially good to<br>be in the company of gradu receiving<br>degrees and diplomas in Commerce<br>Commerce and science Arts and Commerce<br>and surveying these are all sub subjects<br>that are tethered in the real world with<br>many skills that have application to<br>business I've got a particular passion<br>uh for business in New Zealand it's<br>business that grows incomes creates jobs<br>and helps create a better standard of<br>living for everyone I know not everyone<br>agrees right I believe business is a<br>Force for good and it's my hope that<br>many of you graduating today will work<br>in business or start one and become the<br>Business Leaders of the<br>future regardless of where you intend to<br>do your work and make your mark I'd like<br>to wish you great success in your chosen<br>field and I'm sure that the grounding<br>that you've received at the University<br>of tago will prepare you well for this<br>certainly uh my many days of surfing at<br>St cair prepared me well for many things<br>you have learned learned many lessons<br>along your way over the time of your<br>studies here at atago and if I may I'd<br>like to suggest that you keep uh the<br>practice of learning lessons as it's the<br>only way you will continue to learn and<br>grow throughout life uh fire fear TI<br>manga fill the basket of knowledge it's<br>also I'd also like to suggest that you<br>make mistakes and continue to make<br>mistakes not to repeat them but to make<br>new ones and most importantly to learn<br>from them from a business perspective<br>especially learning from mistakes and<br>taking risks are things that are<br>essential for growth I've found the<br>thing that sets apart exceptional<br>business people is being comfortable<br>with assessing and taking risks and I<br>would say whether you're involved in<br>business or not what makes a difference<br>regarding taking risks is whether the<br>goal is worthwhile or not our K katoa<br>tell us make your goals big follow the<br>treasure you value the most dearly uh<br>fire<br>kah qu me Hima TI seek the treasure that<br>you value most dearly if you if you bow<br>your head let it be to a lofty Mountain<br>I would counsel you to think<br>independently as you know the motto of<br>aaga university is dare to be wise it's<br>true that wisdom requires daring daring<br>to consider more than one side of the<br>story daring to think outside of the box<br>even daring to think logically aaga<br>university has a great reputation of the<br>in the areas of analysis analysis and<br>logical thought based on fact and<br>reality and the departments represented<br>here today are great examples of that<br>alongside other outstanding departments<br>at the<br>University these are Living testament to<br>the Council of Superior and independent<br>thought and they part of the reason why<br>I'm proud to be a graduate of atago at a<br>time when group think is a safe haven<br>and at a time when descent or even<br>academic inquiry can be seen as<br>threatening daring to think<br>independently May well be the finest<br>asset in your pity as an aside I would<br>say that independent thought can get you<br>into trouble in today's rather divided<br>world the spirit of our time seems to be<br>about divisiveness and rival C camps<br>shouting at each<br>other in my role as an advocate for<br>business in New Zealand uh looking for<br>success for all businesses all over New<br>Zealand over the last decade I've<br>witnessed quite a bit of the spirit of<br>divisiveness taking hold as a result an<br>important part of what we do at business<br>New Zealand<br>uh is is seeking to build consensus on<br>some of the big issues that will face us<br>all by 2050 things like ensuring our our<br>education system M maintains its<br>outstanding reputation and works for<br>everyone ensuring that the economy is<br>strong so there are a lot of good jobs<br>and opportunities for anyone entering<br>the workforce ensuring we have enough<br>investment so we can afford to build<br>great infrastructure have a great Health<br>Service and social services and and so<br>on it's a bit sad that we currently<br>don't have a consensus on the way to<br>realize these rather fundamental<br>Ambitions but it is a totally worthwhile<br>Mission because without it we don't have<br>much much chance of fulfilling many of<br>our Ambitions and I'd like to suggest to<br>you as you contemplate your life outside<br>the university that you consider whether<br>your role will be to focus on your<br>differences from others or build<br>consensus with others on the things that<br>are important to us all finally I would<br>like to say that all all of the things<br>that I'm exalting you to do live in the<br>real world take worthwhile risks make<br>mistakes dare to think try for consensus<br>all have to be seen within the context<br>of the<br>community<br>K because none of those things matter in<br>the absence of community you are here<br>today because of a whole Community your<br>family your friends your e or your wider<br>family your<br>ancestors your whole kotak kahang that<br>have all played a part in develop and<br>nurturing the person you are now having<br>passed through the Milestones uh of<br>early life and growing up having<br>achieved success in your studies and now<br>ready to start your journey in the<br>outside real<br>world your success in your chosen field<br>uh in your life ahead needs to be seen<br>in
