to<br>introduce us today's graduation speaker<br>andag lus who is now one of the<br>country's most preeminent<br>economists Cameron beg who served as<br>Chief Economist at thez for 12 years is<br>known for his forthright analysis and<br>public commentary on the state of the<br>New Zealand<br>economy originally from Central atago<br>Cameron studied towards a Comm degree at<br>at the University of atago in the early<br>1990s but initially didn't have a clear<br>idea of what the career path he wanted<br>to<br>take after contemplating War<br>architecture and accountancy camon<br>settled on economics graduated with B<br>common economics in<br>1992 after completing his Masters at<br>Kenbury he moved to Wellington where he<br>worked as an economist at the National<br>Bank Treasury and statistics New<br>Zealand there was an aan Z and became<br>familiar face to the public as a regular<br>commentator in the media forecasting the<br>future while under no small amount of<br>pressure to get it right Cameron has<br>previously described the task of<br>economic forecasting as a mix of really<br>good analytical groundwork and natural<br>intuition after more than a decade in<br>the role camon decided it was time for a<br>change and he's now managing director of<br>begy Economics a boutique research firm<br>and he sits on boards including New<br>Zealand Police welfare fund and Life<br>Zealand the please join me in welcoming<br>Cameron<br>b uh thank you<br>Kiora good afternoon the master<br>Chancellor Vice Chancellor m members of<br>the University council facory members<br>families friends and of course esteem<br>graduates uh to great pleasure to be<br>amongst you all particularly the<br>graduates it's your special day make the<br>most of I do not underestimate your<br>achievements uh particularly give the<br>backdrop of Co that little bug that<br>didn't go away uh cost the living<br>pressures and of course the Highlanders<br>rugby team dra<br>against other New Zealand teams was<br>finally broken last<br>weekend and I wish I was in town for<br>that<br>one a special acknowledgement to those<br>that have shaped your journey but cannot<br>be here<br>today um I'm a simple Economist so we<br>have to contend with the old sort of JS<br>for every Economist there will be an<br>opposing<br>Economist and they will both be wrong<br>um nonetheless I'm going to put on my<br>Economist hat because I've got a few<br>areas I want to touch on and anybody<br>that knows me knows that I'm a straight<br>shooter that's a Calo pra that comes out<br>and I'm not going to sugar coat what's<br>going<br>on education outcomes and achievement of<br>today what we seeing amongst this group<br>of F individuals is going Define these<br>young 30 years down the<br>track and I command what you have<br>achieved however if you to look at a<br>recent oecd report that was released two<br>weeks ago it did not paint an optimistic<br>picture on where he young is going to be<br>in 30 years despite success in some<br>marinas you we've got a lot of problem<br>and others and new ze's<br>achievement attendance particularly<br>across primary secondary schools has<br>been on a declining trend for a long<br>time and the oecd has now put some<br>economic estimates over 12 years of<br>declining achievement<br>within Primary in second education they<br>think it's going to knock New Zealand's<br>productivity growth by about 4%<br>now that's just 12 years of what we're<br>seeing within the education<br>system and I give you just some some<br>stats 20% of Mar Pacific island kids<br>attend school less than seven days in<br>10 10% of New Zealand kids attend school<br>less than 7 days and 10 so I commend<br>what you've all achieved<br>unfortunately there is a a whole lot of<br>other broad-based issues uh my daughter<br>she got four NCA points there week for<br>crawling through some<br>mud now I know resilience is<br>important but I shake my head over how<br>far we have<br>gone you are entering an economy that is<br>facing tough<br>times you I love to say there's going to<br>be an abundance of jobs over the next 12<br>to 24 months<br>but unfortunately we're in the payback<br>stage of the economic cycle and the<br>economic Outlook and about as upbeat as<br>a cor's retirement<br>speech the words of War Buffett you know<br>when the tide goes out you find out<br>who's been fing naked come to mind and<br>there's a song by bman Turner overdrive<br>You Ain't Seen Nothing<br>Yet things are got to toughen up in the<br>back up<br>2024 and<br>2025 you the good news is that night<br>follows day just as day follows night<br>and we go through the cycle so we will<br>have a tough 12 to 24 months and then<br>things will come right but of course<br>tough times require difficult decisions<br>and real leaks and the institution here<br>at tar University is no different in<br>regard that they are facing tough<br>decisions over the coming few years the<br>good news is that and he got a huge<br>capability to achieve if we can bold and<br>unite and I want to talk about that idea<br>of unity because it got to issue a<br>challenge at the end<br>here we Face a massive reset and this is<br>not just about fixing the economy this<br>is about getting a bit of balance<br>between the economic the social and the<br>environmental<br>equations that are all<br>part of where we stand the problem we've<br>got at the moment is that we lurge to<br>the<br>extremes and somehow we got to get some<br>balance back into the<br>equation and one of the stats that I use<br>just to highlight How Far We've gone off<br>con there is now 25 million sh in New<br>Zealand and I've got a sing suspicion<br>we reside in a world is set by populism<br>lots of self-interest I'd encourage you<br>to focus on the long game not the short<br>game your short timism is a pl we need<br>to stamp it<br>out if we're going to get that balance<br>right between those those equations the<br>environment the economy and social<br>metrics that we need to be focusing on<br>10 to 20 years out not the next 12 24 36<br>months you're now entering the world<br>faing message change 1 + 1 now equals 11<br>it does not equal<br>2 what happen to the world are<br>exponential change which presents<br>opportunities when I left the<br>university there was a whole lot of<br>companies listed on theuse stock<br>exchange of the top 10<br>there are two still<br>around one is Spar which is an offshoot<br>of Telecom and Spark is nothing like the<br>old Telecom and yeah we all know what<br>Telecom was like in the 1980s and the<br>1990s uh the second fir that's still<br>around iser<br>doing and based on how they're going I<br>suspect they're not going to be in the<br>top 10 for too much<br>longer if you look around the globe<br>Apple Microsoft Amazon Nvidia are now<br>the Giants in the S&amp;P<br>500 the linear world has become<br>exponential in my day we were talking<br>about Exile Coca-Cola Walmart Proctor<br>and Gamble General Electric and M and do<br>not underestimate what you can do as we<br>Embrace AI the fourth Industrial<br>Revolution that Fusion of the digital<br>the biological and the physical<br>but if we accept the basic principles<br>and education outcomes and achievements<br>today will to Fall New Zealand in 30<br>years then a big Chu of that economic<br>future rests with people that are<br>audience around 30 years ago I was<br>sitting in your shoes I'll give your<br>heads up bons change and my generation<br>is going to be transferring the beon to<br>you hopefully make good choices but I'll<br>give your heads up life is not perfect<br>feir or the pl feel Del so expect a few<br>bubs bruises and<br>scratches now you're going to face many<br>questions and decisions I don't have all<br>the answers no one does everybody's<br>unique their PS different but here's<br>some<br>suggestions some things to think about<br>find your why<br>what is the reason that you do something<br>what drives you and this is not just<br>about regeneration making money there's<br>reasons you do anything in life my wife<br>has been defined by my parents losing<br>everything when I was a teenager so we<br>went from a comfortable life to an<br>uncomfortable life and so I've seen what<br>it's like to go without and that's<br>driven me like help of 30 years to<br>rebuild the financial base of my family<br>so my kids and my grandkids do not have<br>to go through what me and my brothers<br>experienced number two this is an<br>environment where I think you're going<br>to learn in the next two years than what<br>you'd learn in five years of good<br>times your reality SS in and you learn<br>more when the G gets tough align<br>yourself with someone who will teach you<br>who will take the time to invest in<br>these early years of your career it was<br>one of the best things I did when I<br>joined the New Zealand treasure in the<br>late 1990s there was a gentleman there<br>who took an interest to me and he put me<br>on the right track and I become A's<br>Chief Economist after I left treasury at<br>a very young age number three find a<br>reset<br>varable there's going to be some days<br>out there where it's not all joyous and<br>happy I jump on a h a machine once in a<br>while and I do 60 to 75 minutes which is<br>what I call Mad man's<br>yoga because it hurts and it's supposed<br>to hurt but that's part of resetting me<br>mentally it could be swimming it could<br>be walking it could be reading it could<br>be listening to music to find that reset<br>variable that's going to help you get<br>through those tough times one of the<br>most important things that I learned in<br>life is<br>time time is spend with people that you<br>care about and do the things that you<br>enjoy if you don't look out your<br>physical or your mental health time<br>ain't worth much so find that variable<br>to get you back into the Zone fourth<br>give<br>back yeah your credentials should give<br>you above average incomes that's why<br>you've invested in your education<br>you're going to end up with the better<br>off end of the<br>spectrum unfortunately across new we've<br>got 370,000 people on a benefit of<br>working age that's one person in<br>nine now child poverty is rampant around<br>New Zealand we do not live in a world<br>where Equity or equality of opportunity<br>exists all kids do not get the same<br>start on<br>life and we've an obligation to take<br>every kid to the start<br>line and I'm sure there's some people in<br>this audience or some of the students<br>over there will there be some individual<br>a mentor a group or someone who just<br>took a bit of an interest to get you on<br>the track to which youve ended up<br>today and I salute those people because<br>they absolute<br>Champions Be A<br>Champion number five<br>chumba<br>wber you all know tub<br>fumin now there's that song you get<br>knocked down you get back up again yeah<br>don't stay knocked down I'll give you a<br>personal experience when I was a<br>teenager I lost my left<br>eye playing first of rugby a year later<br>I just met a guy outside that door that<br>I played uh rugby lead for a Targo when<br>I was down here and then I Shi it up to<br>PR<br>and I became Chief Economist of am and<br>I'll tell you what the Jesus on me<br>sometimes because I knew the was<br>noticeable but you get down you get back<br>up and you just do the goddamn job you<br>don't let anybody tell you you can't do<br>anything number six celebrate<br>success the winds no matter how big or<br>small our last night when I was thinking<br>about what to say the words of s Winston<br>Churchill somebody keep on rolling into<br>my head and the words were united we<br>stand divided we<br>fall the context to that is<br>simple I've never seen you so<br>divided now it's young versus old it's<br>whether the young can afford a house let<br>alone rent a<br>house it's rural versus Urban it's Mari<br>versus<br>nonari yeah<br>device of this is corrosive did anybody<br>notice that the head of rotal Ro boys a<br>student on ANC Day called New Zealand<br>out for<br>divisiveness this is a high school<br>student calling us out for the division<br>that we've got within New<br>Zealand a divided society and economy<br>it's<br>corrosive and one of the challenges I<br>think we've got far forward is that<br>we've got to heal<br>we got to find some common<br>ground it's one of our biggest<br>challenges you are tomorrow's<br>leaders it will take time to get into<br>the positions of<br>influence that help you heal and bring<br>youan together
