to the university but to the<br>inaugural lecture of Professor je Jeff<br>wilmart Jeff has worked in areas that<br>span the boundaries between physics and<br>chemistry and Fields such as shock<br>physics micro and nanofluidics and fluid<br>physics his work has often had an<br>applied Focus contributing to the<br>understanding of areas such as soil eyes<br>food production mining rainfall<br>Acoustics Mass spectrometry organic<br>solar cells and even invasive pathogens<br>not a bad list much of his work has been<br>commercially focused including 5 years<br>as deputy director for<br>commercialization and indust Industry<br>engagement in The mcdad<br>Institute kuringen who is a professor<br>here in the business school did a long<br>attitudinal study of people's careers<br>and found that the single biggest<br>determin it was<br>Serendipity followed by a lot of<br>post-rational<br>I suspect a lot of serendipity was at<br>play as Jeff has developed his career<br>Jeff Pros to say that his career<br>resembles that of the proverbial<br>headless Chu tonight I suspect he's<br>going to supply us with the post-<br>racialization of the Headless Chu as he<br>discusses not just what he's done but<br>what M motivated him to do<br>so Jeff grew up in ockland a girl G<br>scholarship took him to Cambridge where<br>he did undergraduate master's degree<br>degrees in experimental and theoretical<br>physics and then a PhD in shock physics<br>I'll leave Jeff to explain what that is<br>a brief stint as a man Management<br>Consultant can't quite see you as a<br>Management Consultant<br>you was followed by a relocation to IRL<br>in lower Hut working in the Nano and<br>microfluidics team before he relocated<br>here to Oakland on the back of a rather<br>Fellowship in<br>2013 Jeff is currently co-deputy head<br>research of the physics<br>department tonight Jeff's talk will be<br>titled from diamonds to droplets Jeff<br>yours uh thanks John and um before I get<br>started I need to thank uh make sure I<br>thank Sue and the events team for making<br>this happen thanks Diana<br>um or else we wouldn't have been here<br>tonight<br>so when you're a research academic and<br>you get a grant right so you apply for a<br>grant try and get some money for your<br>research and uh you do this and you're<br>grumpy for a couple weeks and you're you<br>know spending your nights and your<br>weekends doing this and then you don't<br>get that Grant because if it's the M fun<br>nine times out of 10 you don't and so<br>you go back to the drawing board and<br>come back again and so on and so forth<br>and you know one time out of 10 you get<br>the Grant and you go whoa I got a<br>million doll go and talk to people about<br>this I got a million dollar and they say<br>awesome sweet how much of that do you<br>get that's the academics laughing<br>um okay so you don't get any of it so<br>when do you get a pay<br>rise ah so you have to apply for a pay<br>rise at the end of the okay so when you<br>become a professor you get a pay rise<br>and that's an excellent thing and and<br>it's you know I think of coming here<br>tonight I think what on Earth are we<br>doing here at an inaugural lecture and<br>and one of the things is that um it's<br>one of the perspectives is that it's<br>just another step on a ladder of<br>academic progression right and and that<br>you you you know you have these<br>applications you go for some come<br>through some don't and you just try and<br>focus on the next thing um you know at<br>one time in an Aug lecture might have<br>been some kind of Coronation or transfer<br>of power um but but that's a bit<br>ridiculous so I've been kind of trying<br>to think about you know what is a no<br>lecture and and and what should we<br>include in<br>it and when you think about that of<br>course you think of our greatest living<br>New<br>Zealander and um you know what would<br>Kane<br>do uh so Kan gets 100 like he does and<br>he goes from 99 to 100 and that's a run<br>and uh that's nothing special right for<br>a game the 98th of 99 through 100<br>through 101st run doesn't matter but<br>that 100th run is something special and<br>he the Bat gets raised he's got 100<br>that's great so the sports psychologist<br>goes you know this is how you should be<br>uh you're in the zone it's next job you<br>hear the rugby players go next job they<br>get up next job next job um you know<br>each step is just another rung on the<br>ladder and that's actually quite a<br>healthy way to be when you're you're<br>faced with this hyper competitive<br>environment and you're getting turned<br>down and rejected for things all the<br>time<br>right so far so good no motivation for<br>an inaugural<br>lecture now um the other thing he's<br>doing of course he raising the bat so<br>there's another bit of sports psychology<br>which says you know we need to celebrate<br>our successes and uh this is important<br>uh especially for academics we're not<br>very good at it sometimes some of us uh<br>a lot of us so we do need to make sure<br>that we celebrate when we reach<br>milestones and for me uh different<br>stages of my life when I was a kid I<br>might have thought well being a<br>professor would be cool when I was you<br>know a bit older I might have thought<br>that's possible and you know last by the<br>last couple years it's kind of a goal<br>and so it was there it was a milestone<br>I've got to admit that and say we've got<br>there great let's raise the bat so<br>that's a reason to be here and who is he<br>raising it to cuz this isn't David<br>Warner<br>right that's not for him that he's<br>raising the<br>bat um he it's the people around him<br>it's the supporters it's his teammates<br>and so this is number one for me being<br>here tonight and the in fact the only<br>thing I really wanted to say tonight is<br>uh inside the room lots of people<br>outside the room as well there's been a<br>heck loads of support and sacrifice that<br>has gone into putting me where I am here<br>and I want to acknowledge that say thank<br>you to you all some people that means<br>you've given up a Tuesday night to come<br>to a lecture other people it's literally<br>half a life time of that sacrifice and<br>support so if there's nothing else to<br>say tonight it's thank you for all of<br>that<br>okay um John can we go the pub now is it<br>am we're<br>done yeah he's<br>off no no we better we better<br>um we better not take the Mickey uh so<br>what are we going to put in the Le show<br>got another um uh a bit of time to<br>fill and um<br>I thought about the audience and it's<br>really nice uh to see everyone here<br>tonight those of you who are by the way<br>who are here for Jeff waterhouse's<br>lecture there was uh 3 months<br>ago um by the by the way I get all his<br>emails that's probably about half of you<br>um we're pretty similar actually except<br>for the the H andex<br>um I want or two laugh at<br>that uh yeah so the audience and I know<br>when I'm an academic and I come to these<br>you know actually want to find out about<br>the person cuz you know you can go and<br>Google someone's research that's all<br>fine uh you you want to know what makes<br>people tick and where they come from and<br>and that kind of thing and I'm going to<br>start with kind of an origin story um uh<br>you You' call it um Papa but<br>that's that's not my C cultural heritage<br>but that concept is is I think extremely<br>valuable you know I've got colleagues<br>here who I'll be talking I'll talk about<br>my origin story and I've been working<br>with you for more than 10 years and you<br>don't know where I come from right uh<br>and that's ridiculous um so we'll do<br>that and uh for those of you from<br>outside the university you probably yeah<br>I put on a tagline on the LinkedIn post<br>um what I've been up to for the last 20<br>years so we will get through the<br>research um and as much um we'll scoot<br>through that quickly put it that way um<br>and I'll have a rant uh which is what I<br>want to do uh and I kind of like to do<br>this sometimes one of the the thing I've<br>decided to talk about tonight is really<br>draw on my motivating threads of why<br>I've done things I've done it's exactly<br>what you're talking about John um post-<br>rationalization of of the Headless Chu<br>um and and talk about uh yeah well we're<br>in the middle of a consultation phase<br>for how the science system in New<br>Zealand should work and when I respond<br>to that I think of what my own<br>motivations and and and uh pathway have<br>been all right<br>so Origins and again not trying to like<br>um you know from a um Tanga point of<br>view lay lay claim to Mount Eden but I<br>did grow up in Mount Eden and I do like<br>this view this my photo beautiful um<br>view uh looking out over both any<br>direction you want to look from mounten<br>and we'll see we'll see my links to<br>mounted in a minute so I'm going to<br>start with uh at level my grandparents<br>why do I do that I think if you go to<br>great grandparents you've got eight<br>people and unless you're from Canterbury<br>or something all those stories are quite<br>different<br>and um oh Alex Smith would have got he<br>would have got that wouldn't he yeah uh<br>you know and and it's it's too much to<br>talk about um and it's it's it's just<br>too much information and it starts to<br>get all blurred I think at about the<br>grandparent level you've actually got<br>quite a lot of influence on yourself but<br>one great grandparent this is uh J Mills<br>who was Mir of Mount Eden back in the<br>time of Mount Eden<br>Bar I mention him as one great-<br>grandparent because his son my<br>grandfather was also m so these two were<br>both M of Mount Eden Bar um uh pop seams<br>uh and Gran shown this photo so Gran was<br>the grandparent that I knew best and she<br>used to take me uh on the bus from Mount<br>Edon down to uh along Mount Road down to<br>the fury building watched the faires go<br>in and out of the fury building when I<br>was a young lad so the MS they owned a<br>Mill's money saving store which was<br>situated halfway down Dominion Road<br>there's a song in that somewhere<br>um so it turns out a general store<br>halfway down to minion Road must be by<br>empirical evidence a pretty good<br>electioneering base I think campaigning<br>base um so this is Mom's side and she<br>had two uncles one on each side who went<br>away to World War II um uncle sell Uncle<br>George and one came back Uncle George's<br>grave is in Elam they both served in in<br>North Africa here's uh Uncle s on his<br>OE uh I like that photo he's he's drawn<br>the arrow himself by the way on the when<br>he's<br>other sides um marjerie uh Wilmot uh<br>died relatively young left dad as the<br>eldest of five children when he was<br>about 20 years old so uh that was quite<br>a profound effect on their family and<br>itchy or Robert wlmart on the right<br>let's read from this clipping he's<br>retiring after 37 years as a mag's u<br>master of English he has hammered<br>English Latin French and history into<br>boys during the years he has been at the<br>school his nickname was<br>itchy um so my family cuz wilmot's not<br>that common a name you come across men<br>of a certain age and there's a lot of<br>them that will go hang on um among those<br>he taught apart from my own dad and his<br>classmate Peter Snell um he taught um<br>Jeff Talon who will figure in this story<br>quite a lot in a minute uh Mike frell<br>who is our Latin and uh for master at<br>school and at our school he taught um my<br>father-in-law Bruce Bond uh as it turns<br>out that was an interesting day at the<br>out uh and this is Dad on his OE uh in<br>Athens in the 60s he was a teacher went<br>taught him in uh London for his Zoe uh<br>so dead passed away 2017 um and you know<br>he would have love this because he he<br>had some affinity for the University of<br>ockland he was a school principal he's<br>not involved in tertiary education but<br>he had trained here done a ba here in<br>the old Coral Hall they had their<br>lectures holiday job scrubbing toilets<br>in um Albert Park um for he's got a<br>plaque in St Andrews on Simon Street he<br>was the church organist there for 25<br>plus years and what was the other thing<br>oh he came and he used to invigilate<br>exams he's one of those old Buffy had<br>coming and uh and uh after when he was<br>retired and and you know he did that for<br>like 15 years and I'd have you ever<br>caught anyone no no no no what's the<br>point if you're not going to catch<br>someone dad would have been proud I got<br>I I rang rang mom of course I rang mom<br>when I find out okay I've got a got this<br>promotion mama got this promotion first<br>thing mom says oh your dad and your two<br>about 5 minutes later I get it out of<br>her that she also is<br>proud uh this was us in 1980 love the<br>color schemes that's me I'm the little<br>one um so Mom and Dad both School<br>teachers and we both benefited from you<br>know that focus on we all sorry<br>benefited on that focus on education and<br>I don't know what it was but um Craig<br>and Megan are both<br>um and myself all did first Science<br>degrees um we weren't particularly<br>science focused but there was uh<br>background of um I guess of logical and<br>analytical thinking<br>and skepticism cynicism about things<br>they're both looking at me skeptically<br>now uh yeah so and both at Oakland so me<br>did um bio biological sciences and Craig<br>did um computer science both uh both<br>here<br>okay that's the environment for the<br>family environment here's the<br>geographical environment so that there's<br>Mount Eden and this was kind of my<br>neighborhood uh that's the Mercy<br>Hospital previously known as the mar<br>hospital and I was born in the mara<br>Hospital uh my first house was actually<br>in three kings uh next to the other end<br>of St Andrew's road but when I was about<br>six we moved to rangy Road here just on<br>the slopes of Mount Eden and then I<br>attended Mount Eden<br>primary all Intermediate School and<br>wanded around the mountain to Orland<br>grammar school for um for my high<br>school um also on the map featuring<br>prominently over there is Eden Park and<br>Mom would give us our $5 on the Saturday<br>afternoon to wander down there 15 minute<br>walk or so uh get into the ramly shield<br>challenge what a thump whoever they<br>thumping and uh that was uh gave me this<br>kind of lifelong tragic hook into rugby<br>and Cricket um<br>following and uh on that note this this<br>combination of schools M primary normal<br>or grammar same as the Yani Brothers<br>Aira and<br>Rico uh something that that that I'm<br>sure they're proud of as well um Orland<br>grammar uh clear you know we were lucky<br>it's a clearly a good school education<br>and you know I think I'd say to it to<br>the people there's some in here who I<br>kind of worked along side academically<br>in those years at or grammar is that<br>that is still the best I mean it's an<br>artificial constructed environment in<br>high school but it's still the best<br>learning environment that I've been in<br>in terms of kind of constructive<br>positivity and and and and um learning<br>alongside other people um and I got into<br>it I loved it and there was lots of<br>stuff on offer and I was playing rugby<br>and cricket and Tony in the school<br>orchestra<br>and uh a lot of fun and then I was<br>Deputy head<br>prefect Deputy here<br>prefect and I was like do I need to be<br>bit taller what's going on here yeah so<br>there's a head<br>prefect uh here Douglas he scored 49<br>test tries for the All<br>Blacks nice guy yeah so that was fair<br>enough um but what happened uh is I got<br>and it was mentioning the intro this<br>thing called a good scholarship to<br>Cambridge and this was it's awarded to a<br>school leaving New Zealander who has all<br>round abilities and there was one a year<br>the goodless company is a livery company<br>based in London they fund they've got<br>connections to New Zealand and they fund<br>scholarships so the goodless scholarship<br>is uh you know awarded with a kind of<br>philanthropic aim of people um coming<br>back to New Zealand and or or doing<br>things that would would benefit New<br>Zealand and so I went there um straight<br>out of school as an undergraduate did an<br>undergraduate degree stayed for a PhD so<br>hence was Affiliated to Corpus Christie<br>for a number of years here um and what<br>can you say other than this is in<br>retrospect of Bolt out of the blue like<br>I've been involved now as you are when<br>you're an academic in numerous processes<br>of selection and applying for things and<br>you know that when things are<br>competitive it comes down to a to coin<br>toss or twist of fate or whatever and um<br>just in this case first place was um<br>going to Cambridge when you're 18 and<br>that was me so that's that's the major<br>thing that happened um fry reads here<br>tonight good to see fry was another<br>goodless<br>scholar um I won't r r it on about<br>undergraduate years but I will show this<br>is our um photo of our cohort of physics<br>students after our final exam um at the<br>end of fourth year and I have this photo<br>and I have to profusely apologize to Jan<br>aldrid who was in the photo uh because<br>we were classmates and uh I have on a<br>number of occasions prior to today<br>vetoed the use of this photo<br>because it's I I don't I it's too<br>embarrassing or something I don't know<br>you might get an idea why uh and then<br>now my in augural lectures coming up I<br>said to I wandered down the hall and<br>said to Jan Oh can I borrow the photo to<br>show so that is massively hypocritical<br>and I apologize but it's getting an<br>earring so here we are that's our that's<br>our hundreds of lectures with these<br>people right let's have a look down the<br>end here zoom in there um people here<br>there's our there's our class rip uh JJ<br>Elizabeth stanway um longtime<br>collaborator we see around the<br>department quite a lot this here is<br>Chris Greenwood he is my mate he studied<br>chemistry he doesn't belong in this<br>photo but but like a good mate he'<br>popped along to the last exam with a<br>bottle of bubbly so he got on the<br>photo<br>um I actually think this is a fair<br>reflection of of me in in terms of my<br>social engagement with this group<br>like I'm on the end of my Rugby Jersey<br>and baggy jeans and more interested in<br>this than what's going on there and I I<br>wasn't engaged with physics or socially<br>with that group very well at all I had<br>my friends I had my things I did but it<br>wasn't part of this partly that was my<br>fault partly I think it does reflect you<br>know I think of it now in terms of a a<br>working culture and um places you want<br>to be and people you want to work with<br>and it wasn't great um to be honest at<br>at Cambridge the academic side excellent<br>um but the kind of social uh cultural<br>environment for learning slightly<br>different<br>story um so you know I was looking I'll<br>go get a job somewhere this isn't I'm<br>not going to be an<br>academic this guy I don't think I've re<br>ever really talked to anyone about this<br>um Darren Redford's probably the reason<br>I'm doing research so this is uh people<br>in chemistry um chemical Sciences might<br>um take note of I was looking for a<br>master's<br>project uh or well part three project<br>say there's a list of projects so we're<br>talking about this in chemistry how to<br>list projects for students to pick and I<br>got there late and I was unenthusiastic<br>and there was like a couple left down<br>the bottom and I chose one with this guy<br>Redford looking at shock shock impact<br>tailor impact of glass rods and when I<br>went to go see him we just clicked he<br>was<br>a you know professional standard and<br>play professional professional standard<br>ice hockey player and um a nice normal<br>person uh and he worked hard and wanted<br>to do good work good experimental work<br>but he had come from outside the<br>Cambridge system different attitude and<br>showed me I could do research and be a<br>normal person that sounds rude to<br>Cambridge colleagues but it was a little<br>bit like<br>that anyway so the part three project<br>this is tailor impact of glass rods this<br>is time in milliseconds it goes like<br>this there's glass rods hitting a<br>surface whack at does it say 370 m/s and<br>it breaks um kinetica the defense<br>research establishment for the um<br>British and they were interested in<br>these types of materials for for armors<br>and so<br>on now Darren was part of the group led<br>by um John Field John had a<br>long-standing connection with the beers<br>the diamond company and he had a PhD<br>project going and again I wasn't<br>massively um enamored by the idea of<br>being an academic or anything but I<br>thought well it's a project it's an<br>interesting project I quite like this<br>lab and and um you know PhD at Cambridge<br>at the end of your name that's going to<br>be good it's worth 3 years uh so jumped<br>into that bill helped a lot with the<br>day-to-day supervision of my PhD this is<br>a diamond um it's diamonds to droplets<br>by the way I heard um Janet my wife<br>preferred it would be the other way<br>around you know Dres of<br>Dimes so that you know anyway<br>well this is a slice of diamond and it's<br>got a you know it comes out of the<br>ground it's natural diamond so it's got<br>a um a floor here and so in gemology you<br>know you've got this big diamond and<br>you've got to cut that floor off and you<br>you end up with these kind of flat<br>slices uh this is that same bit of<br>diamond kaber we know the four seas of<br>diamonds we cut them we crack them we<br>crush them up and we collect the bits<br>yeah um now this is the movie uh this<br>crack here there there there moving at<br>faster than the ra wave speed um is the<br>fast I think as far as I know the<br>fastest crack ever recorded in a solid<br>um<br>and<br>yeah I mean there's like 180 pages in<br>this thing but<br>yeah so you graduated and this was in<br>the era where kind of distractedly<br>talking on your cell phones while a<br>picture was taking was was seen as a<br>okay I came back to New Zealand uh the<br>connection Mark Warner was a sadly<br>passed away a couple years ago he's a he<br>was a kiwi professor of physics at at<br>cin in Cambridge and had this had<br>connections home and and then Jeff<br>Talon uh was is uh Professor Bas in<br>Wellington attached to IRL as it was in<br>the time who had collaborated at the cam<br>and one day Mark arranged me to sit down<br>with uh Jeff uh just to have a chat and<br>I said something like like I'm<br>interested in coming to New Zealand to<br>do science and I remember distinctly<br>Jeff kind of looking at me going<br>repeating what I'd said back at him go<br>you're interested in coming to New<br>Zealand to do science like is this guy<br>crazy or what and uh<br>anyway I came back on the long lamented<br>long lost lamented forced uh<br>scholarships there's lots of people who<br>have uh propping up our science system<br>now who did that they got scrapped by<br>Steven Joyce um the other thing I'd say<br>about Warner he lectured me in uh third<br>year physics uh third year flu mechanics<br>and I'm currently teaching 332 9:00<br>tomorrow morning two or three people<br>here see you<br>there uh yeah so here's my fluid<br>mechanics<br>lecture all right um so when I came back<br>to New Zealand uh have to get up the<br>paast to get some of this research in um<br>came to Industrial Research limited<br>which turned into Kahan innovation in<br>2013 so was their for S8 years and the<br>project I came back was looking at slip<br>and we wanted to look at whether fluid<br>immediately adjacent to a surface would<br>move relative to that surface and these<br>Chaps in the 19th century had written<br>down that well maybe it could maybe it<br>didn't in general um it could be nonzero<br>but the kind of engineering approach or<br>the the approach that everybody took in<br>practice is that no we have this<br>non-slip boundary condition that the<br>fluid immediately adjacent to a wall<br>doesn't move you know this if you look<br>at flow through any kind of Channel or a<br>river as you go towards the edge um the<br>fluid flow slows down and slows down at<br>zero at the<br>edge so there's exceptions uh that we<br>were interested in is when you get down<br>to small scale flows adjacent to<br>chemically repellent surfaces<br>hydrophobic super hydrophobic surfaces<br>can we get slip and can we measure that<br>we used a torsional oscillator um and so<br>the idea here was um using different<br>crystals p Electric crystals bit like a<br>qcm I can see jny over there but in a<br>torsional mode and then you damp the um<br>specimen Rod um using the fluid and the<br>sheer stress at the boundary um tells<br>you about about the interaction there so<br>got into that and the long-term effect<br>of that is that I at one point sat in<br>the library for a couple of weeks and<br>said what happens if you have a slip<br>boundary condition on the surface of a<br>sphere and particularly a asymmetric<br>sphere and so I have a couple of kind of<br>single author mathematical physics<br>papers saying what's the um you know the<br>corrections to the Stokes fluid flow<br>when you have a uh these types of slip<br>boundary condition on the surface of<br>spheres um and these spheres they have<br>this 50/50 these are called Jos spheres<br>here's a from later a molecular whoops<br>molecular Dynamic simulation showing<br>that they do actually rotate depending<br>on the<br>so the pink side is grippy it's the<br>hydrophilic side and it rotates<br>according to the flow so we show this<br>later with with<br>simulations right these are Janus<br>particles so I've been kind of playing<br>with them ever since this is a Janus<br>Roman god of doorways January is named<br>after Janus so the New Year comes in the<br>old year goes out um Jael and Hyde two<br>face in Batman you know that type of<br>popular culture in College Science um<br>it's a particle with different physical<br>and chemical properties on on on<br>different<br>sides more about them later uh about<br>this time also Ison they were initially<br>called AO then they became they<br>rebranded to Ison came along to IRL and<br>said oh can we get a bit of help with<br>what we're doing so this is a startup<br>nanotech company and they were using<br>tunable nanopores I never got to the<br>bottom of whether we should include the<br>e or<br>not um some people Mike Arnold was my<br>longsuffering manager at IRL and and I<br>owe quite a bit to him just in terms of<br>mentorship and these are my first three<br>PhD students Al Peter and Eva who all<br>worked on this resistance pulse sensing<br>stuff this slide I've shown more than<br>any other slide why not one more time um<br>tenable resistant pul sensing uh happens<br>when you have a membrane po polymer<br>polymeric membrane filled in surrounded<br>with aqu electrolyte through this pole<br>here you apply a voltage across the<br>membrane and that drives ions through<br>the PO so positive and negative<br>depending on which way the electric<br>Field's going and so it's like electrons<br>and holes in a wire it creates a current<br>um versus time plot and the difference<br>with an electrolyte when you have<br>particles in there is that when those<br>particles go through they can block the<br>current these things are called<br>resistive pulses the idea is that you<br>can tell things about the particles<br>which may be very small based on the<br>properties of these resistive pulses so<br>it's kind of an analysis or measurement<br>technique the other thing about these<br>particular this particular technology is<br>you could stretch the membrane on large<br>scales and it would acurate the size of<br>the pore on small scales so they made<br>the using the um uh using the technology<br>relatively easy so Ison the company had<br>developed um the kind of platform so the<br>pore just goes in the middle of a little<br>hole here and um you stretch out the<br>arms and legs of this cross-shaped thing<br>to make the PO bigger and smaller using<br>that uh rotating handle you're loading<br>the the fluid cell around the the pore<br>up here um this is what the pore looks<br>like under microscopy can focal and sem<br>microscopy this is what it looks like um<br>to<br>scale uh and our real our major<br>contribution over the years and the<br>thing that's produced a bunch of cited<br>papers I think probably created the most<br>impact for the company as well was just<br>establishing the measurement protocols<br>so you know this is now real<br>experimental data current versus time<br>and these Peaks here tell you the size<br>of them tells you about the volume of<br>the particles how often they occur tells<br>you about the concentration and then<br>down the bottom here the shape if you<br>expand out these um pulses the shape of<br>them tells you something about the<br>charge and shape of the particles um and<br>so you know this weren't this my wasn't<br>my best science but it gets the most<br>highly cited papers because Downstream<br>all the users of this equipment then go<br>oh we' got to use this measurement<br>method so that was a nice careerwise and<br>I think also set the company up pretty<br>well you know now they're um UK based<br>but they have a manufacturing facility<br>which recently got upsized in Christ<br>Church there's a bunch of people work<br>there the latest Capital raise they got<br>20 million in there um uh a couple of<br>years<br>ago okay uh and the other major thing at<br>IRL was capillary uptake a droplets and<br>these are two quite strong mentals for<br>me uh sha who was in the applied maths<br>group just down the corridor and Kiara<br>Sydney who was a physical chemist and<br>taught me a lot about taking care in<br>physical chemistry experiments um so I<br>work with them on this project and<br>interestingly now they're both hitting<br>up um startup<br>companies uh we were interested in<br>capillary uptake of droplets so it's<br>actually an a a problem driven by<br>nanoscale issues so when you create<br>carbon nanot tubes you were getting<br>cataly lodged in the in the nanotube and<br>that shouldn't happen according to the<br>understanding at the time of how wetting<br>worked so we did these experiments um<br>and it backed up with mikica Dynamics<br>modeling from Sha's team um showing how<br>the lass pressure of a finite sized<br>droplet on the outside of a capillary<br>tube Alters the speed at which you can<br>take um uh capillary at which capillary<br>outtake occurs and it can also mean that<br>fluid which doesn't even wet the<br>capillary tube will um wet<br>it uh this work got me my first cover on<br>a um Journal uh and what this goes to<br>show is you don't have to have a very<br>good picture to get on the cover of a<br>journal okay so 2012 was a bit of a red<br>letter year really careerwise uh this<br>quote this is what someone said to me<br>once<br>um in 2012 after a few years of of um<br>chipping away uh um f up mden uh and a<br>Rutherford Discovery fellowship and you<br>don't get these unless you've kind of<br>established an independent research<br>profile um so I'd kind of built up this<br>idea that we were doing the nanofluidic<br>plumber right so you're you're doing<br>these bits and pieces on small scale<br>fluid mechanics and you need the tools<br>to be able to do that and that was my<br>raford Discovery pitch yeah there was 13<br>something like that years of rather for<br>Discovery fellow it's about 130 fellow<br>and I think I'm one of uh there might be<br>two or three that came out of Cris so<br>I'm quite proud of that like building<br>that profile of research up from being<br>in a<br>c but the timing was perfect<br>because IRL was going through a<br>restructure to Kahan Innovation and<br>because people are idiots they're<br>cutting scientists and uh so it wasn't a<br>great place to to be looking at to for<br>for for your future for a career and at<br>the same time there was a bit of<br>Rejuvenation happening in the physics<br>department at Oakland and Jim had his<br>eye out and approached me and said oh<br>would you interested in coming to talk<br>um and so I ended up talking first with<br>Jim but then pretty quick with Richard<br>when I said Richard Easter when I said<br>well actually I I trained as a physicist<br>I'm not going to teach you first year<br>chemistry for you I'll do you first year<br>physics uh something along those lines<br>I've ended up at a joint appointment so<br>7030 um physics and<br>chemistry um yeah so the timing this is<br>lucky in a way uh the grants came in at<br>the same time that there that it was rip<br>there was opportunity to to change where<br>I was and so this is where I've been<br>since and on that same note as well as<br>Richard who is since uh been uh a<br>consistent and wise if sometimes a loud<br>Mentor uh I need to thank Richard and<br>the other HDs that have been quite um<br>important all influential in quite<br>different ways so Gordon mcell um Jance<br>here and Duncan had to apologize for<br>tonight um<br>right uh what have we got yeah we'll do<br>this for about 10 minutes then we'll get<br>to the end um so I'll talk about work<br>we've done here for uh in terms of<br>assembly in terms of soft microparticles<br>and droplets okay let's get going uh<br>Steven Chong is working on the self<br>assembly project we just got a review<br>paper out if you want to read all about<br>it um and this is about the idea that<br>once you get these JIS particles these<br>asymmetric particles and start<br>assembling them they can form<br>interesting higher order structures and<br>you can control how they Assemble on<br>Large Scale based on the details of the<br>interaction at small scales so there<br>something like an analogy to molecular<br>um you know to to atoms binding and<br>forming molecules except you can kind of<br>control how these how these colloids are<br>are are set up<br>um and when you look at Pathways for uh<br>things assembling you always need to add<br>one and one to get two as the first step<br>so we were particularly interested in<br>the fundamental um interactions between<br>two Jus particles because of the<br>importance that has on the assembly<br>process um so we did some molecular<br>Dynamics modeling along these lines this<br>is ca saay he was a did a<br>PhD co-supervised with sha and Canon's<br>been working on this more<br>recently um yeah I love this so this was<br>a CO era of course and some of you will<br>recognize this kind of thing so<br>supervision via<br>zoom and specifically via Microsoft<br>Paint<br>so this is me trying to describe to Cena<br>you know you should do this thing with<br>your results so Cena Julie went and Drew<br>the a nice picture<br>good and uh these these charts in the<br>middle here he also Drew yeah so we use<br>molecular Dynamics and numerical<br>integration two different methods to<br>figure out how should two JIS particles<br>sit next to each other when they come<br>into a contact in a in a weekly binding<br>regime and they sit like this um so<br>you'd think they might sit into n but<br>it's configurational entropy there's<br>only one way of doing that but they<br>other um and seen it a whole lot of cool<br>simulations like this kind of coar grain<br>protein type thing where you could<br>include the amphilic interactions with<br>with the surrounding solvent um so it's<br>grained um we tried to make Jan well we<br>have made Janes particles and got better<br>at it so<br>it was just like this kaisa Latif was a<br>PhD student on this Anu started it off<br>briefly uh and we got better at it and<br>we get these nice smooth um Coatings of<br>gold on a glass bead for example and<br>this is the type of thing we're trying<br>to do now use microrex make these things<br>interact and then experimentally study<br>their orientation relative to each other<br>so applying image analysis to this we<br>can get the statistics of how these<br>things are oriented relative to each<br>other and understand the the fundamental<br>interaction<br>there um very briefly but it's been a<br>great project um two very good students<br>Nicola leanda and K gangotra uh worked<br>on something that's come to be known as<br>iron pet aspiration it's a method for<br>measuring the mechanical properties of<br>small squishy particles which in<br>healthcare and and things like um<br>liposome Technologies is becoming more<br>and more important um some nice<br>reasonably high impact biologically<br>facing uh work involved and how it works<br>is just like this uh you this is very<br>similar to resistor pulse sensing that's<br>kind of part of the inspiration in that<br>you're measuring the current going<br>through the current blockage and you are<br>also looking at a what's called an<br>aspiration experiment so you looking at<br>this thing getting squeezed and you're<br>combining U physical models with these<br>data in order to determine the<br>mechanical properties and doing through<br>so on a high throughput basis so got a<br>project funded by um smart ideas by um<br>MB that's just starting up pretty much<br>um Chim Min is here who's a student one<br>of the students working on it who landed<br>in the country two days ago so welcome<br>you've done very well done very well to<br>get<br>here uh and droplets so bunch of people<br>have worked on droplets and there's been<br>a lot of work so just kind of scoot<br>through some give you a picture is<br>Matthew he's here somewhere um iub<br>Miguel Steve and Santos in the in the<br>picture uh this was this is a animation<br>based on a series of sketches made by<br>Worthington in the late 1900s was a<br>droping back so what Worthington did is<br>Turned the Lights Out dropped some<br>Mercury on the<br>desk and then uh open his eyes so he's<br>got the lights out his eyes are open<br>drops the Mercury and then sets off a<br>Flash and then whatever's imprinted on<br>his eyeballs he drew he did that like<br>hundreds of times<br>drew it down drew it in a book whoops<br>can't get it to play again there it goes<br>drew it in a book and we can animate it<br>now so I mean this whole talk I used to<br>give which I love but you don't get to<br>do it too much anymore about history of<br>high speeded photography which kind of<br>starts there um but here's Matthew<br>working in and he basically set up our<br>lab um working in our lab during his PhD<br>with a um Commercial High speeded camera<br>and this is to light his experiment<br>where he's going to do drop impact on<br>the stage<br>there um a Ser of people have worked on<br>drop landing on micropillar arrays or<br>structured surfaces so we understand<br>kind of what happens and we can in<br>theory describe what happens when a drop<br>lands on a perfect surface but most<br>surfaces aren't perfect they're rough<br>and furthermore you can control the<br>roughness so if you um uh you do microf<br>fics you can U microfabrication you can<br>make arrays of pillars with certain<br>symmetries and so on so um uh Matthew<br>worked with pictures like this and so so<br>you zoom in on there and you've got um<br>pillars with spacing and size that you<br>can control and that are regular and<br>spreads and these little fingers that<br>come out at the edge um are determined<br>partly by the micro<br>structure so uh on the poster for this<br>talk you would have seen images like<br>this right so you get these quite<br>striking symmetries depending on on on<br>the on how you arrange the drop impact<br>um I just flagged Sam's here tonight and<br>he's been doing some nice work on um<br>spreading drops and getting some more<br>analysis of the Symmetry at the edge<br>here um and trying to figure out uh<br>what's going on<br>there Further Adventures in highp Speed<br>photography I'm going to literally flick<br>through this because it kind of gives<br>you the flavor of a range of things so<br>we've looked at drop imp Packs near a<br>ridge so that it jumps up uh on a<br>gradient so the drop jumps sideways<br>that's collaborating with her taro<br>ferrofluids so you have a magnet<br>underneath this drop it elongates it<br>doesn't reach stability and it forms<br>Frozen's vague instabilities upon<br>impact lovely to<br>film uh soils and Sands important for<br>um SS and Sands important for<br>agriculture irrigation right so when the<br>drop lands on the soil it doesn't get<br>absorbed um and it kind of the outcome<br>dep depends on things like the granular<br>um poly dispersity how how similar all<br>the sizes of the grains are and the<br>sizes of the grains but one of the<br>interesting things here is you can use a<br>a a scaling method from um planetary<br>cratering to describe how big these<br>craters are relative to the to the<br>impact so that was really nice reading<br>this cratering paper going hey we' got<br>got the same scaling<br>here uh pigs yep so these were drop<br>impacts on Pig Corners this is about<br>this about trying to understand how ey<br>drops spread on your eyeball and the<br>different solvents you use and how well<br>they they they spread so IL renthal up<br>at U mid school was looking into that uh<br>leaves uh so we're working now with Lisa<br>and and the past you know there's<br>actually a whole lot of questions here<br>about how<br>evolutionarily the leaves came to um<br>direct water in different directions and<br>why they did that and so we studied and<br>both these studies actually the historic<br>one of the most one we focused on New<br>Zealand native plants um to figure out<br>if there's anything distinctive about<br>how our um you know leaves in New<br>Zealand um control droplet<br>imps uh nice collaboration with across<br>the road uh Lily pantam was a postop for<br>six months and she looked at rainfall<br>noise so some of you might remember and<br>when you're in a<br>classroom uh and you're young and<br>there's rain like there has been<br>yesterday and last night and you can't<br>hear the teacher that was the issue that<br>they were looking into so the type of<br>roof cladding that you can put on that<br>dampens that rainfall noise um and so<br>the the real difference here in terms of<br>what the experiment was doing is that it<br>had a pressure sensor under the drop<br>impact and you could this is the force<br>applied by that drop it leaps up and<br>comes down and you can model that so<br>Michael kingan LED that team um and that<br>was a nice collaboration over with<br>engineering uh Electra spray for Mass<br>spectrometry so when you have a the so<br>you try to mix two things and spray it<br>in into a mass spectrometer for uh<br>analysis when you do that you get a<br>tailor cone and you want to know how the<br>mixing is happening um I particularly<br>this was a project done by Anna radian<br>NOA and and these two weren't actually<br>my students but they're the graduates<br>that I'm actually particularly proud of<br>because I took over from Peter Derek who<br>passed away while they were still um<br>studying and they spent like the last<br>year two year or two of their PHD<br>dealing with me who's non-s specialist<br>in in their in their field Nick demor<br>our mpect trist um and both did really<br>well in their thesis so kind of proud of<br>picking that up and and getting it<br>yes so when the Bales light up<br>right you is this plane no is that plane<br>plane what time did the Bales light up<br>relative to the spigot coming out of the<br>thing because when you look on TV and it<br>lights up you go oh that's out but is it<br>out at the right time it's a very<br>important question so pop down to theen<br>park head a look that um we been doing a<br>bunch with uh of milk stuff as well so I<br>got into milk looking at spray drying<br>and um you know to cut to the chase<br>we've looked at a bunch of um heated<br>droplets Landing which may fail the<br>sides of our spray dryer it's a complex<br>problem because the way droplets dry um<br>and we have an ongoing collaboration<br>that Cynthia andreani is working on not<br>so much about droplets more about rology<br>um with Fon on the basis of<br>that okay good got to the end of that<br>and I can well we got about maybe 10<br>minutes of of of rant so the wbit is uh<br>not why are we doing this research but<br>what's been driving me I guess and um<br>there's this it's kind of a corny and<br>naive answer really and it's about what<br>you're trying to do is contribute to to<br>your community right so this is like the<br>type of thing that gets drummed into you<br>from an early age and uh when you're a<br>naive small child people say to you you<br>know you got to give back and um<br>essentially I never got away from that<br>and I was able to never get away from<br>that um and what you<br>know there's this particular choice that<br>this was from the abstract at one point<br>I was working I had a you know<br>management consultancy job in middle of<br>London well paid good prospects<br>interesting work I could easily have<br>stayed there that would have been fine<br>uh and chose to come back to um IRL and<br>you know it's 50% pay cut or whatever<br>and um and work in lower<br>Hut uh and yeah it's it's the cheesy<br>answer it's and so you think of you know<br>the gir's scholarship when they gave you<br>that money they said we would like the<br>scholar to<br>um do things use their education ways<br>that will benefit New Zealand<br>um is things like the the Orland grammar<br>school prayer every morning uh we will<br>learn to use our time and talents for<br>the good of our nation as things like<br>three kings school where my little<br>nephews go now uh my first school act<br>well your part you're part in something<br>so there's this idea that we have that<br>we um you know you're given something by<br>the community and you're going to give<br>back and I was able to I had been able<br>to through my career stick to that so<br>part of that is about being lucky and<br>privileged enough to do so so let's talk<br>about<br>that um and clearly you know in New<br>Zealand and the time I've been living as<br>a white male I've got there's been<br>structural Privileges and and we all<br>know about those and the um you know if<br>I talk about the origin stories at the<br>start uh all of the the pakha people in<br>New Zealand at those times benefited<br>either directly or indirectly from from<br>treaty breaches for example so so let's<br>acknowledge that<br>um and then you think of the privilege<br>of my education which is not necessarily<br>an accident I mean this is sacrifice and<br>choices made by parents so it's partly<br>inheritance um so but but definitely it<br>was a privilege the education I got and<br>particularly I've already talked about a<br>few twists of Fate that were pretty<br>lucky in in the way I came through<br>getting a scholarship raford Discovery<br>fellowship at the right time Etc and you<br>know as I say you be on both sides of<br>that you'll know that that that can be<br>just lucky so so I've been lucky that<br>I've been able to kind of be that<br>ideological person and say right I'm<br>going to um contribute to my<br>community and you know not everyone can<br>do that you got to be pragmatic you got<br>to earn money and and support people and<br>so<br>on but this led me to this kind of<br>reflection this around 2015 I gave a<br>couple of talks it's basically about<br>Survivor guilt so I managed to navigate<br>the system and get a job um other people<br>didn't why why me it's and and so you go<br>and talk to people about how should the<br>system work so it's better so that more<br>people are incentivized to be working on<br>behalf of New Zealand actually rather<br>than what I call cockroaches which are<br>academics who are just doing the the<br>thing that keeps them their job and you<br>understand their point of view they want<br>a job they'll do whatever it takes to<br>keep it so I have this idea about<br>circles and and you have who are you<br>working for so the blue bit is your you<br>and your ambitious and your immediate<br>family and then you know you have your<br>research group perhaps and your<br>institution and the country and maybe<br>you've got some kind of global impact to<br>your research and all of these might be<br>asking you to do different things that's<br>kind of the point and so you got to ask<br>yourself and people got to ask where do<br>you lie what are your motivations what<br>stakeholders and um<br>this is where I am I mean you know you<br>got to you got to admit to a healthy<br>dose of kind of looking after your own<br>your own um ambition and those of your<br>family and I emphasize you know benefits<br>New Zealand and and I'm I'm sorry<br>University of ockland but I couldn't<br>really give a toss about strategic<br>planning you<br>know uh so but that's that's me other<br>people be different but you want these<br>things to be aligned and I think you<br>know in other professions people<br>understand we've got to work as a team<br>and we've got to align motivations and<br>incentives and we just don't do that and<br>that's that's where I'd take the science<br>system if I got to R run it which I<br>don't um but I've been part of the McD<br>Institute um and they're very much along<br>the same uh line of thought in terms of<br>um you know doing doing things right by<br>the community um and I'd been involved<br>in a bunch of Industrial Research and<br>worked in the an internship with BCG<br>worked at ocn these are the management<br>consultancies um and so when when I came<br>through MCD Institute into leadership<br>positions I became deputy director for<br>commercial and Industry engagement this<br>is I did this for 5 years up to last<br>year and this is um you know I think we<br>did some really nice work as a<br>leadership team so this is uh Justin and<br>Nicola were the um directors and Paul<br>Krueger there're the other deputy<br>director for most of that time um and<br>then down the bottom I got a couple<br>pictures Gavin Clark on the far left and<br>uh Kevin shei here who's um winning the<br>the kwiet research commercialization<br>award last year um both Tau me a lot<br>about research commercialization and I<br>think together the these are the<br>research uh the commercialization<br>managers for the McD Institute I think<br>together set up a good kind of um<br>support network for the ecosystem that<br>is MCD Institute research so these are<br>startup companies coming out of the McD<br>Institute you can see a explosion<br>activity around 2010 a lot more started<br>happening and these are all startup<br>companies in New Zealand young<br>scientists a bunch of them have students<br>who have graduated and gone to run the<br>company another bunch of them are<br>directly involved in sustainability<br>plays they're capturing carbon they're<br>doing battery recycling they're making<br>amonia for Less carbon Etc so this is<br>cool this is the kind of thing I like to<br>like to promote and have done more and<br>more often you're advocating things in<br>the Press you're trying to get get<br>across the stuff in this box that the<br>characteristics of deep Tech research<br>are aligned strongly with the values we<br>have as a country that we want to be<br>doing things<br>sustainably while having economic<br>benefits looking after guardianship<br>being rich having an equal Society deep<br>Tech can deliver all of those things<br>better<br>than<br>tourism mcdom<br>Institute uh also through Jen Fitz James<br>many of you all know did a good check of<br>its um alumni and you know looked at 527<br>destinations we find about you know 10%<br>of these people now go and work in<br>startup companies and another uh 15 in<br>in larger industry and Technical roles<br>and this is the you know historically we<br>would train phds to be um working in<br>universities and now we train them to do<br>whatever and one of the things I was<br>involved in doing was setting up within<br>the Institute this career and relevant<br>industry skills program it's a modular<br>program for getting Advanced Materials<br>PhD students and giving them the skills<br>to um work in all kinds of environments<br>outside of the uh<br>University so leadership on the right<br>hand side of some<br>organizations uh and on the left hand<br>side are some positions I've<br>held am I not tall enough what's going<br>on no I mean I wanted to point this out<br>because I I mean I think a lot of my<br>best work in leadership and I see a lot<br>I see people who do the same thing is<br>support we have a lot of peacocks in<br>Academia and people need to follow<br>through and make things happen and<br>that's what I rate I can takes just as<br>much creativity that's what I've been<br>doing in these roles and so I support<br>all of you who I can see doing<br>that um something I was lucky to do was<br>be on the onboard program which was for<br>startup governance um a couple years ago<br>so learning a bit about how to um be on<br>a board for a startup company um and<br>I've taken that forward actually in a<br>slightly odd way I'm I'm a trust for<br>good baking which is a large<br>charity in New Zealand they something<br>like 2.5 million of of social good<br>delivered to the economy each year 3,000<br>people who um deliver baked goods to<br>people in need as a charitable um active<br>kindness um Nick and Maria the founders<br>so I played Cricket with Nick's husband<br>that's how I got into this<br>um if you like baking go and do this or<br>if you don't like baking take it<br>up<br>um yeah<br>okay so uh to to finish if I uh think of<br>um when I was kind of younger what I<br>wanted in a career one of the key things<br>was variety I didn't really want to be<br>stuck in a in one lane and I've had I've<br>given four I've got four talks this is<br>the third of four talks over a couple of<br>weeks um and fatan at a Toho careers<br>expo at The Writers Festival in a Sci-Fi<br>session I was a panel chair this talk<br>and then next week at a industry event<br>and so you get that variety I'm getting<br>that variety and and so I'm I'm really<br>kind of happy with the challenge the<br>extension and the and and the variety I<br>get in my career and and so I'm I'm in a<br>happy place in that sense in terms of<br>where I might have wanted to be when I<br>was a kid and and now I'm there<br>um I uh you know the future I think uh<br>more of the same and that sounds like<br>it's not creative um that wouldn't get<br>you funded but particularly when I you<br>know that what I described about being<br>Thomas the Tank Engine being a really<br>useful engine in a community um that's<br>what I hope to keep the same whatever<br>role I'm in um and and where I need to<br>to where where where I feel like I can<br>contribute in<br>future um I've done a lot of travel uh<br>and one thing you learn where you travel<br>is that it's a lot more fun when you're<br>not on your own um so a lot of people<br>haven't mentioned and I just you know<br>particularly people who don't crop up<br>when you're talking about what you've<br>done but have been there to help you out<br>so it's friends inside and outside of<br>the department many of whom are here I<br>can't talk about everyone sorry um of<br>course I'm going to finish with uh this<br>lot<br>um this was another raising the Bat
