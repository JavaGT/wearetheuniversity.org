is the executive and residents and<br>I'm excited to ask him a few questions<br>about himself and his career my first<br>question for you Mark is You' have held<br>a number of roles on Boards of directors<br>what motivated you to take up governance<br>roles early on in your career instead of<br>pursuing management positions within a<br>singular company it was probably more<br>luck than management which means most<br>inovation didn't really come into it I<br>started my career and registered my<br>first company really uh a couple of<br>years after leaving University so I had<br>a history of working for myself ended up<br>in banking again kind of fell into it<br>and then exited at a time when I decided<br>probably the time was right for me to go<br>back and work for myself and that<br>afforded me the opportunity to consider<br>governance because I've been offer at a<br>few roles on some quite large boards it<br>was kind of a um more good luck than<br>good management to be fair um and it<br>grew from there because I was still sort<br>of self-employed but working on these<br>boards as well and um I found it really<br>interesting and I was really happy doing<br>it my second question infertil has had a<br>lot of successes with you as chair on<br>reflection what are some of your<br>proudest moments and do you have any<br>regrets when a board and management are<br>aligned as we were then with every dire<br>director<br>contributing 100% and where the board<br>had complete trust in each other and we<br>had trust in management as well it meant<br>that um our our decision making was a<br>lot better as a consequence we could<br>make decisions really really quickly um<br>because of this kind of secret source<br>and and we got to a position where you<br>know truly the whole was greater than<br>the sum of the parts it was an exciting<br>place to be my only regret it's probably<br>a regret in respect of a deal was was<br>that um we sold Oakland International<br>Airport when we did the shell deal but<br>we we kind of had to because we needed<br>the cash we were in the middle of the<br>GFC but we left a lot of value on the<br>table that one in hindsight that's<br>probably one of my biggest regrets ESG<br>considerations are now very important to<br>investors and firms as someone with<br>experience in governance positions have<br>you observed attitudes towards<br>sustainability change over the years<br>I've had the really good fortune to work<br>with long-term investors and when you in<br>a long term uh investment Horizon game<br>ESG is always a factor but I think<br>what's changed is that this has become<br>recording that has become far more<br>structured the Frameworks for thinking<br>about ESG are far more formal uh there<br>are more and more benchmarks available<br>as well and our shareholders have<br>demanded more transparent reporting on<br>that um and highlighting where they<br>might see performance issues I think<br>that's been the big change<br>my fourth question given your current<br>role as chair of tiawa e Holdings and<br>past involvement in multi commercial<br>Ventures could you elaborate on some of<br>the unique aspects of these roles<br>compared to traditional corporate<br>environments it's this view that you're<br>not necessarily an owner but you're a<br>guardian that by its very nature means<br>you have an intergenerational view on<br>the assets and on the investment program<br>and there's a deep Ed cultural desire to<br>exercise kakang um over particularly<br>taonga assets and a large group of that<br>is actually um natural resources this<br>results in a a sort of a natural<br>position where it gives you this<br>wonderful opportunity to ride through<br>short-term cycles and short-term uh<br>shocks to the system probably the second<br>unique endowment is a unique<br>relationship with the crown as a as a<br>treaty partner and that's an incredibly<br>powerful thing it's it's going to be<br>enduring because of these two things you<br>can Bank on one is that the crown will<br>be here in 100 years and definitely M's<br>tongue of the F will also be here in 100<br>years and so that relationship has a<br>really inuring nature to it and I think<br>the last thing is the shareholders of M<br>entities are more than happy to circle<br>the wagons when things get really tough<br>we're quite happy to um hold dividends<br>to to keep the um keep the money within<br>the within the entity and that enabled<br>us to ride through that and actually uh<br>be in a position to buy assets when<br>maybe other people were having<br>difficulties with liquidity and and<br>wanted to sell now for my last question<br>what advice would you offer soon to be<br>graduates as they leave University and<br>enter the corporate world and sort of an<br>interesting quote from Warren Buffett<br>when he was asked about his ideal CEO<br>and he said they must be<br>hardworking they have to be smart and<br>they have to have integrity and when he<br>was asked what was the most important of<br>those three it was Integrity so always<br>act with integrity you're in a whole<br>world of pain if you've got someone<br>that's smart that's hardworking but has<br>no integrity and probably the final<br>thing is um better to be lucky than good<br>what do I mean by that never<br>overestimate your own ability or own<br>impact on on things um try and be as<br>humble as<br>possible awesome well that concludes the<br>interview thank you so much for joining<br>me Mark it was great to hear about your<br>career and experiences thank you Hannah</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
