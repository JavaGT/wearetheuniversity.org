have<br>you with us today we're going to talk to<br>you about the educational Network we<br>designed the network to harness the<br>power of our teaching staff and our<br>professional staff to over time<br>transform the learning experience of our<br>students<br>Kara means to move forward as a<br>collective so this is about not a few<br>doing the work but all of us gathering<br>together to do this collectively and to<br>find our voice collectively and enhance<br>the learning for<br>students the network is led by six kery<br>these are people who gather us together<br>to do that work together and I have them<br>with me here in the studio today and I'm<br>about to introduce them to you but first<br>I just want to say to you whether you're<br>in the studio here today or you're<br>watching this on Zoom or online that<br>you're a really important part of this<br>and so at the least today if you have a<br>question for us there'll be time for<br>questions at the end please do ask those<br>questions if you're watching on Zoom<br>simply type your question into the chat<br>feature and we'll be able to answer it<br>here in the studio you're a really<br>important part thank you for giving us<br>your time today for a really interesting<br>discussion one of the highlights for me<br>over the last few months has been to<br>have these lovely energizing inspiring<br>conversations with magnificent people<br>sitting here with me these six<br>ker it's a privilege now just to bring<br>you into those conversations and here a<br>little bit about how we've been talking<br>but more to the point just for us now to<br>think about what we're seeing at the<br>moment in these early stages of the<br>network actually taking shape we have<br>six ker unfortunately two of them are<br>unwell today so we can't have with us<br>Nicola beatson from the division of<br>Commerce nor Sheena Townsen from the<br>division of Sciences but we do have four<br>and we're in for a really good<br>discussion I'd like to begin by<br>introducing them to you I'm going to<br>start with Joe welcome Joe would you<br>like to tell us just a little bit about<br>yourself thank you T I'm Koto Joe Bor<br>too so my name is Joe Boren and I'm a<br>lecturer in the Department of Nursing<br>and based in Christ Church so I'm the<br>kai corle for the division of Health<br>Sciences on the Christ Church campus and<br>it's a pleasure to be here today to<br>discuss the network with you thanks Tim<br>thank you<br>Joe<br>Rebecca Kiko Kiko uh my name is Rebecca<br>bird I'm a senior teaching fellow in the<br>department of anatomy and um I'm very<br>honored to be the denan campus rep for<br>the um division of Health Sciences<br>working alongside Joe and Chen in the<br>division thank you<br>Rebecca Koto Ben caros TOA my name is<br>benv caros and I'm a senior teaching<br>fellow in the school of geography uh<br>geography finds itself in the division<br>of humanity so I have the privilege uh<br>of being the the the uh the network<br>coordinator there for the division as we<br>work our way through the beginnings of<br>this you know terrific opportunity for<br>which we're all embarking on together<br>thank you<br>bean um<br>k um tooo um know Bing China how I'm a<br>senior professional practice fellow<br>e-learning and based in Wellington<br>campus I'm also one of the um High<br>science Division and K uh representing<br>Wellington<br>campus very good thank you Chan thank<br>you so as I said we've we've been having<br>some lovely conversations um those<br>conversations were looking ahead to the<br>network as it took shape and and now<br>we're we're the network I would say is<br>building building nicely building slowly<br>but nicely and we're starting to see it<br>with our own eyes uh I just wonder what<br>you're seeing what are you noticing<br>about the network at the moment and what<br>does that say about what the network<br>will do for our University and maybe<br>I'll go in the same order for this one<br>and just start with you Joe what what<br>what are you noticing what are you<br>seeing what does that mean well what I'm<br>seeing what I'm really noticing is that<br>um in my beginning conversations with<br>people around the network and um the<br>rationale for establishing the network<br>the um response has just been<br>overwhelmingly positive from the um<br>other uh teaching staff and academic<br>staff that I've been connecting with in<br>Christ Church and obviously um outside<br>of Christ Church and into denan uh<br>there's been real excitement about the<br>opportunity that this network will<br>present people to be able to share and<br>um connect with other people in the<br>teaching and learning space in a way<br>that perhaps they haven't um felt there<br>been an opportunity to do<br>previously thank you John how about you<br>Rebecca what are you seeing I think the<br>components of the network already exists<br>they existed for a while we have people<br>doing amazing things um amazing<br>Educators amazing professional staff<br>being so supportive as well<br>and um just getting to talk to people<br>it's been very informal chat so far but<br>a lot of enthusiasm excitement of a<br>really positive future so really some<br>experiences with Jo yeah yeah I'd agree<br>with that I've I've been talking about<br>uh joining things up and making things<br>visible like we have wealth hidden in<br>plain sight already Yes uh we just don't<br>quite see it or bring it together or<br>make the most of it so that's starting<br>to happen you're you're both seeing that<br>that's great<br>what are you noticing I think further to<br>to those comments there's there's<br>terrific people on campus and lots of<br>different places who are uh who are are<br>ready and willing to help support you<br>know dynamic and and effective teaching<br>and learning for our students and across<br>my time as a senior teaching fellow<br>making my own connections with those<br>people has been fantastic the AV team<br>e-learning a number of groups on campus<br>and now the Network's able to maybe or<br>will bring those people into into the<br>this the discussions and the<br>conversations to make sure that people<br>know where they are who they are what<br>they can do and what they're able to<br>help us obtain which I think is a great<br>outcome good thanks P yeah thank you<br>team uh I think as I mentioned I'm the<br>learning facilitator so like my daily<br>work is to engage uh teaching staff with<br>the technology enhance learning I think<br>I already witness sort of the<br>conversation um like center learning and<br>teaching unfold and I I say like there<br>is a very strong desire uh people<br>wanting to be connected and also want to<br>share uh resources and the ideas<br>practice so I say this network I also<br>like from our valton campus we receive<br>like lots and very positive feedback and<br>there is lots of response and also the<br>um people have the ideas they want to<br>use the network as a dynamic platform to<br>connect and also um sort of have a<br>culture of like social learning peer<br>support mhm yeah yeah good that's great<br>thank you for sort of Illuminating what<br>you're noticing at the moment I'm going<br>to put you on the spot a little bit I<br>mean I I I offered a sort of one<br>sentence description of what the network<br>is designed to do I wonder what your one<br>sentence would be I talked about<br>harnessing the power of our teaching<br>staff and professional staff and and<br>based on what you are observing at the<br>moment how would you characterize that<br>quickly uh I guess for me it would be<br>thinking about the network has um like<br>we've talked about previously um<br>together um developing a community of<br>practice for Learning and teaching for<br>the benefit ultimately of our student<br>body um to uh enhance teaching<br>Effectiveness to enhance their<br>experience uh at our University that's<br>good job so you use the the idea of a<br>community practice that really does fit<br>for what this<br>is we could think of it as a large<br>community practice but we could also<br>think think of it as distinct<br>communities of practice joining up yes<br>exct together and as Rebecca was saying<br>previously um these communities there<br>are communities already um in place<br>within the university with the focus a<br>great focus on learning and teaching so<br>we're looking at um providing a forum<br>where people can connect together so um<br>to share information as chin was saying<br>to help and support each other to be<br>Innovative about our teaching and um<br>learning practice uh and uh just to be<br>able to connect yeah thank you John how<br>would you say it in a sentence or two<br>shining a light on the amazing work<br>that's already happening um cuz there<br>was there was so much and shine ey on<br>the ability to connect and collaborate<br>as well Ben mentioned people being ready<br>and willing and I think that summarizes<br>so many of the conversations I've had of<br>people going I'd love to share this and<br>I'd love to talk to other people and I'd<br>love to troubleshoot with others who've<br>already been doing stuff in the space<br>and they haven't had that connection<br>before so the fact that we can help<br>connect them through has been really<br>wonderful um and I think as well um yeah<br>just just uplifting people and giving<br>them the recognition for the things that<br>they've been doing I've had<br>conversations with people about this<br>they say I'm not doing anything special<br>and you start talking and they have such<br>great ideas they're doing things that<br>are special or they have ideas with a<br>little bit of support they could<br>Implement and that's what we can bring<br>to it I love that thought of uplifting<br>people that's that's exactly what it's<br>about<br>and I think also I was thinking as you<br>were talking rebecca the great thing<br>about this network is we don't want this<br>to be an extra for people or a burden<br>for people if they're already feeling<br>sort of time poor this is something that<br>we're creating for people if they're<br>willing and wanting to connect um so<br>it's not being forced upon anybody um<br>it's something that's an opportunity for<br>people if they would like to I've heard<br>from people that they see it as a chance<br>to save time so rather than having to go<br>out and learn something on their own and<br>struggle through it they can say hey<br>this is what I'm interested in and we<br>can help connect them to people already<br>doing that so already sers way of Saving<br>Time yes yeah it would be great if<br>Sheena were here she was telling me last<br>week that she'd be had a couple of<br>conversations with people where um you<br>you discover that there's something you<br>want to do and it's happening over the<br>fence over there or over there and and<br>you you then go to those places find out<br>what they're doing Discover it works<br>really well do it for yourself and that<br>that that sharing of ideas and practice<br>and Innovation even also just being<br>Innovative with the ideas this was<br>something that I was thinking about like<br>you're saying Tim I'm not sure how to<br>implement it but or potentially I've<br>never thought about that but actually<br>that would work really well in my<br>classroom or with my group of students<br>and how can I make that happen in my<br>space and so we want to help support<br>that I think we've already seen that<br>amongst the six of us KY you know just<br>us chatting and we we talk about<br>different things and already I think<br>we've got some great relationships<br>building there and new ideas that are<br>being formed just from us talking and<br>before bringing other people in and<br>that's been really wonderful we do have<br>a great team I mean let me say this uh<br>I'm I'm just so pleased with the the kai<br>cery and the quality of leadership we<br>have um super pleased and I hope you're<br>getting the sense of that as we're<br>talking bean I wonder uh for you how<br>You' sort of crystallized this in a few<br>words I think similar uh there's there's<br>nuggets of gold sort of scattered across<br>the campus and maybe it's more than<br>being scattered they actually well<br>dispersed across campus and there's an<br>opportunity here for greater utilization<br>of some of those things that people have<br>put time effort and energy into you know<br>and it comes back to this notion that<br>It's tricky sometimes as a singular<br>teacher to find time and to be a little<br>isolated and trying to make change and<br>and understand whether that change or<br>that point of difference is is working<br>for you but when you open that up and<br>you see what others are doing and some<br>have tested the water and tried before<br>you and have some feedback and some<br>ideas it's ultimately so much more<br>straightforward if you have this common<br>place to to connect with and then find<br>those people who are your people and<br>then work together to ultimately make<br>that student experience just that way<br>bit better as we try and you know<br>incrementally do this together and and<br>yeah get really good outcomes for our<br>students yeah nice being thank you how<br>about you chin um I probably have a long<br>sentence I have three pair of C so I<br>used to introduce the network to others<br>so I think firstly um conversation and<br>connection I think that's really lies in<br>the heart of the network and<br>conversation and of teaching uh learning<br>and teaching and also as and our K as<br>the facilitators to make the<br>conversation happen or like more visible<br>to reach um a Wilder audience and<br>secondly that's collaboration and the<br>confidence so I think that's um Network<br>can serve as a platform so people can<br>easily find um likely mind peers and<br>also I see network as a could be a safe<br>place for people sharing experience and<br>sort of build up a science of confidence<br>in our community and finally that's uh<br>community and culture so I really say<br>that Network can join people together<br>bring us together and for community of<br>learning and practice and uh ultimat to<br>um like Foster um a culture um inclusive<br>culture um for towards the learner<br>success yeah great chin I love those<br>three C that's the first time of well<br>done that's great that that's a nice way<br>of putting it thank you all for building<br>a kind of collective vision of what<br>we're about um I'm I'm going to begin<br>with you on this question Rebecca uh<br>what what motivated you to be a kery<br>what why are you here that's a really<br>good question um I I've been at the<br>University for 13 years now and the<br>thing I love doing most is getting to<br>learn what other people are doing and<br>hearing them share ideas and talk and I<br>love as well getting to tell other<br>people what someone I've met is doing<br>and going Ben you'll never guess what<br>Joe's doing this is so cool um so I love<br>doing that and I've always thought it's<br>a bit crazy I go say like a teaching<br>conference and I will meet someone there<br>who's from Oto<br>and they will tell me what they're doing<br>and we're in Oakland or we're in Sydney<br>you know and it's just it happens here<br>so the idea of being able to be part of<br>sharing that and lifting people up here<br>I think was just it was too big of a<br>thing to pass up I had to throw my hat<br>in the ring for it and um it's one of<br>those things I think we're all time poor<br>but it's one of those things that it<br>fills your cup when you're when you're<br>taking part of it so I knew it was going<br>to um I think I'm getting more out of<br>this already than than the people I'm<br>working with I feel so I feel uplifted<br>by it as well man what a great answer<br>thanks Rea how about you been what what<br>motivated you I think across the time of<br>being a teaching fellow to senior<br>teaching fellow I'd engaged with some<br>magnificent people on our staff from you<br>know all corners of the campus from all<br>facets of the campus and and felt like I<br>had something to offer in helping others<br>find those terrific people from you know<br>academic units to student support units<br>to Administration it all ties together<br>into that student experience which<br>ultimately you know is around that<br>teaching and learning but we all have<br>such a big part to play and so having<br>fostered some some great relationships<br>for my particular group of students I'm<br>really keen and excited to spread that<br>to others who might be have been me 10<br>years ago wondering where I solved this<br>problem and where do I go and if I can<br>help you know uh assist in that space<br>then then that's pretty cool yeah that's<br>great so that's it's about expanding<br>your influence in a way and bringing the<br>same kind of work that you've been doing<br>yeah in your own location more broadly<br>yeah and and I think that that's an<br>opportunity for all six of us in terms<br>of our past experiences will really help<br>those that are coming behind and and<br>catching up and being you know terrific<br>you know teaching ambassadors across the<br>campus yeah great what a great word<br>teaching<br>ambassadors great word J um I think when<br>I first saw the email U my inspiration<br>to become uh a part of the net work to<br>become a k as I mentioned um like my<br>daily work is to support teaching staff<br>I really enjoy the conversations and<br>also the engagements and also sort of<br>like my privilege to already say the<br>conversation happens and I already say<br>I'm sort of doing the the like the RO um<br>like Foster the conversation and also<br>probably other part from for the network<br>and I say this network is very inclusive<br>open to all stuff and also the scope<br>like go beyond um across all the<br>divisions I think that's very exciting<br>I'm just really looking forward to the<br>new ideas and sharing resources um like<br>across the divisions um coming from this<br>uh multiple uh disciplinaries yeah good<br>morning Chim that's a great motivation<br>thank you how about you Joe why are you<br>here why am I here um well I'm very<br>pleased to be here excited to be here um<br>and feel very fortunate to be here<br>actually uh so my motivation when I saw<br>the expression of Interest come up I was<br>really excited because this is a area<br>that I'm very passionate about in terms<br>of working in education learning and<br>teaching um my research is education<br>focused uh and here's something where I<br>can um engage in an applied way like<br>chin was saying um in a sort of<br>multidisciplinary way not just within my<br>own department but within the wider<br>University uh so I'm based in Christ<br>Church um obviously as I said earlier in<br>the Department of Nursing and I saw this<br>network as a great way um of bringing<br>lots of different departments within our<br>city Christ Church um and being a<br>conduit between them and the um<br>university based here in denen so I was<br>very excited to be um part of the<br>network and the development of that yeah<br>good well thank you all for some can can<br>I add something yeah you sure<br>can so so getting to work with with<br>these three who I hadn't had a chance to<br>to get to know very well before but I<br>I've known in Shea for a while and work<br>with them on things and the thing I've<br>learned is that all of us were doing<br>something like this on a very small<br>informal scale already in our in our<br>department or school you know and very<br>very informally so I think for all of us<br>it's something we were passionate about<br>anyway and it came at the right time I<br>think for everyone and um just sort of<br>formalizes something that that we've<br>loved doing anyway yeah that we love<br>doing anyway isn't it and and like you<br>said the opportunity to meet lots of<br>people even just since we've begun this<br>year um the opportunities that we've had<br>and now um being able to share that to<br>the to the wider Network I think yeah<br>I'm really looking forward to doing<br>that that's great thank you for uh<br>telling us a bit about yourselves um as<br>I've explained the network is building I<br>I just think beautifully I'm so pleased<br>I'm just so pleased with what I'm seeing<br>they're like the green shoots um<br>building really well so I'm about to ask<br>you what you've been doing to help build<br>it up um but let me just just explain um<br>to those in the studio those online that<br>there's an element that will be<br>appearing soon it's a digital platform<br>it will it will really be the glue that<br>that helps to hold this thing together<br>and what what impresses me I think is<br>that we've been able to get this level<br>of activity without the platform when we<br>build in the platform and as we build up<br>layers of activity I think this is<br>really going to grow and have huge<br>potential that's what I I think I'm<br>seeing at the moment and I just want to<br>pay a particular acknowledgement he's<br>not a on the stage with us but Russell<br>butson has been uh crucial in designing<br>uh the network uh and and he is working<br>so hard with it and other staff who<br>themselves are working so hard to bring<br>us a digital platform so just this is a<br>shout out to you Russell uh for the work<br>that you're doing and helping to design<br>uh the network and that platform thank<br>you very much uh but let's think about<br>what you've been up to and how how<br>you've been building activity and to<br>start with youin what what have you been<br>doing up there in inton to try and get<br>the network up and running in practice<br>um yeah first I want to say so currently<br>uh three of us the he science division<br>uh kores work as a very cohesive team so<br>we like meet for nightly and we already<br>organize um the divisional discussion<br>about the uh the role of generative AI<br>in teaching practice and research and<br>also we planning a series of the<br>showcases and also the workshop to bring<br>more people together I think that's um<br>also forer a culture of like social<br>learning like they learn from each other<br>and sort of like approach ground up and<br>also like align with the personal<br>understanding and also the um the<br>meaning making I think that's real like<br>in enhance the outcome like more<br>effective and also um um substantial and<br>the other um thing like probably um<br>especially uh particularly for our<br>valton campus we recently experience um<br>like a few building changes um like<br>including our working and also the<br>teaching space but this year like for<br>majority of us um we can transition back<br>to a share space we really cherish this<br>moment I think also for the network and<br>we can use this um opportunity to like<br>reassemble our community and bring<br>people like just enhance the connection<br>and also um from the um our Wellington<br>staff from the um like our conversation<br>people really want to um use the network<br>as a platform to uh introduce their<br>service and support and also like the<br>Innovation and also like what they are<br>currently doing in the teaching practice<br>they want to exchange ideas yeah good so<br>you've been help all of that happen<br>thank you CH that's great how about you<br>joh great thanks Tim so in Christ Church<br>um I've been connecting with people who<br>currently sit in the education advisor<br>roles um meeting them um having some<br>introductory conversations around how we<br>can support each other what's currently<br>happening in that space what could be<br>more widely distributed um for the<br>network um to be involved with as well<br>also some key support people as been um<br>was talking about earlier but on the<br>Christ Church campus um such as Rebecca<br>fibs and the library who is very keen to<br>be part of this network as well uh so<br>that's great and then like with Chen and<br>Rebecca we've been focusing on<br>generative AI uh and education and so<br>we've set up um obviously an initial um<br>conversation around that but I'm looking<br>to also be doing our showcases so look<br>out for those we' love to have lots of<br>involvement and the great thing is um<br>when we're showcasing it's showcasing<br>what people are doing currently in their<br>teaching in relation to um generative AI<br>uh so people sharing what's happening in<br>that space for them and then we're going<br>to follow that up with a workshop um to<br>provide more information because that's<br>what we heard from um teaching staff<br>that they'd like more information about<br>how that can they are able to utilize<br>the generative AI in their teaching<br>practice so that's what we're working on<br>currently in that space uh in Christ<br>Church we also have the education<br>committee so I've met with Michael ma<br>who's the um chair of that committee and<br>the kri role in Christ Church is now<br>standing position on that committee too<br>so um I'll be uh part of that and um<br>excited to be looking at what the<br>opportunities are for the network um<br>collaborating with people in in that<br>committee on the Christ CH campus thanks<br>Joe that sounds great good work Rebecca<br>um so as well as working with with with<br>chin and Joe on um the J of AI thing<br>which um has been uh really eye opening<br>for me we the three of us are not<br>experts in this area um so we are very<br>much facilitators for it and bringing<br>people together I think was was really<br>wonderful we just had a discussions and<br>people started saying that oh I'm using<br>a little bit of this but not in any<br>amazing way and then they'd tell us<br>about it and it was amazing and um so<br>sharing of those ideas and then giving<br>the chance you to to Showcase that<br>that's something we're we're really<br>excited for um and I would say as well<br>um if that's something you're interested<br>in doing please do contact us um and and<br>we can facilitate that um because this<br>is obviously a great form to be able to<br>share that message I think um and but<br>and saying that um the showcases that we<br>are um have got planned coming up uh we<br>haven't had any trouble have we with<br>people who have been very kind to share<br>in terms of what they've been involved<br>with so we're really fortunate in that<br>regard a few people who said oh surely<br>this isn't anything revolutionary but it<br>actually is and it's you know it's<br>amazing to hear their perspectives I<br>think not just uh here's how you do<br>something but their Reflections as well<br>so I think that's what's going to be<br>really beneficial for us so we have all<br>that planned uh everything else<br>informally uh has been happening<br>informally uh lots of chats um with<br>people around the need in campus um<br>looking forward to to doing some more<br>formal um chats with some of the the the<br>heads of um different departments within<br>um the division as well so that's<br>planned to come up and um I hope it's<br>okay it's kind of separate but we also<br>have a teaching focused academic Network<br>which sets separate to koua but but<br>alongside it in tandem with it that um<br>coincidentally we launch very much at<br>the same sort of time and it's for<br>teaching fellows professional practice<br>fellows and people and um Ben Sheena and<br>I are part of the group that's steering<br>this as a way to um really again uplift<br>people provide a way to connect and um<br>professional development opportunities<br>and we've been having I think quite<br>informal conversations in some ways with<br>this very large network of people and um<br>so those sort of of talks as well across<br>diversity of the divisions has been<br>really wonderful yeah yeah no I want to<br>acknowledge the teaching focused<br>academic Network um I I think of the<br>educational Network as a network of<br>networks so it's it's just joining up<br>what's already there and this is a new<br>one but it's already there and it's and<br>it's such an important one because a lot<br>of the teaching teaching fellows do<br>other professional practice Fells do a<br>lot of teaching really really important<br>connection and I I just before I move on<br>to Ben I just want to acknowledge the<br>the the work on AI because I think that<br>really does help to illustrate what<br>we're trying to do with the network um<br>we<br>it's such a challenge generative AI how<br>are we going to respond to that as a<br>university and we're looking around for<br>answers but this is about respecting our<br>teaching staff and their capabilities<br>and giving them the confidence I think<br>this is what you were saying Rebecca<br>confidence that actually we can work<br>this out actually we we're what we're<br>doing is actually better than we think<br>and and we're going to work that out<br>together it's not like the experts are<br>going to come in or it's going to come<br>in from the top down uh but collectively<br>in our in our distinctive divisions but<br>collectively we'll respond to that<br>challenge and and that's where we've<br>chosen to start really in in our in our<br>activity in the divisions is to have<br>that conversation and that conversation<br>will get up and running and then we'll<br>move on to other conversations and other<br>challenges and and together build a<br>response the response part I think is is<br>really important I was talking to some<br>of the people who came to the session<br>that we held on Zoom um within our<br>division about G of AI and after it<br>wasn't what I was expecting I thought<br>you were just going to tell me what to<br>do and I was going to walk and go oh I<br>don't have time for this and as talking<br>said well no we're playing these<br>showcases now that we'll have a workshop<br>in the end and they the fact that we<br>were going to close that that Loop and<br>come back to them they shared ideas with<br>us and we were going to bring it back<br>around in ways that would be practical<br>and useful for them um they said they<br>hadn't had things like that very often<br>before and I said well that's what we're<br>going to do we're always we're going to<br>listen and we're going to respond to<br>that and bring something back and that<br>was um a really nice conversation to<br>have cuz they were so pleased so pleased<br>that their voice what they' said was<br>going to um because they said something<br>like I'd love to talk about this more<br>and we said absolutely so they were<br>being heard I think was a big part of it<br>yeah yeah and like you were saying Tim<br>in terms of the focus currently um being<br>generative AI but we would like this to<br>be driven by the people who are in the<br>classrooms you know by the lecturers and<br>the professional practice um you know<br>colleagues and uh so if there's any kind<br>of um topic or subject that I guess any<br>um of you would like to discuss then<br>please do let us know and we will help<br>to facilitate that yeah good one thank<br>you Ben um what have you been up to so<br>we're in the midst of um organizing and<br>pulling together a panel discussion<br>across generative Ai and the division of<br>humanities which will seeks to call on I<br>guess the diverse breadth of How It's<br>been utilized within the division but<br>also with a student component too in<br>terms of how they're using it within in<br>their space and in their uh and how they<br>see it so you know it seeks to capture a<br>series of different views and offer the<br>opportunity for people to ask some<br>questions and to hear things that are<br>happening in different places<br>departments that have worked through uh<br>some uh material for students in terms<br>of how they ought to or could be<br>thinking about utilizing it in a in a<br>way that's that's practicable and useful<br>as well as staff who using it at an<br>individual scale as well as some of the<br>I guess the ups and downs that have<br>occurred over the last sort of 24 months<br>that it's really become become one of of<br>these um interesting topics for us to to<br>delve into so that so hum that's coming<br>coming real soon in terms of pulling<br>people together to be a part of that<br>panel I think the really interesting<br>element was early on in the network uh<br>Ryan Walker out of Av sort of heard s<br>about this and connected with me Ryan<br>being the AV uh lead and had a wonderful<br>sort of exchange and conversation with<br>Ryan as an example of one of these<br>groups that sits on campus that's ready<br>and waiting in terms of how he and his<br>team could add value and he's got great<br>goals in how our teaching spaces the<br>physical spaces are set up how they're<br>consistently organized how staff can<br>interact with them in a great way so<br>that those students who are in the room<br>and even online can make sure they get a<br>good experience across those moments<br>that we're teaching and we're learning<br>and so spending uh some some time with<br>him hearing his ideas um being you know<br>I guess a um a sounding board for his<br>goals and his aspirations was was really<br>exciting you know there are it's a great<br>example of a team of people on campus<br>who are doing great things and we're<br>able to to connect with them and help<br>them connect with others on campus and<br>that's going to be a really interesting<br>um project component of this and uh he's<br>got ideas around helping staff<br>understand the basics through to making<br>the most of the room through to ensuring<br>that you feel comfortable when you<br>arrive to the room whether you be new<br>whether you be experienced or whether<br>you come from another place where maybe<br>the what you see in the room is<br>different I think he's got some some<br>great thoughts and uh yeah it was real<br>it was a really nice occasion just to go<br>and see him speak with him for some time<br>and really get to the bottom of his<br>plans and see immediately that the<br>connection with the network was just<br>it's just beautiful just it's organic<br>and it'll be something that um that we<br>can really work together on as he<br>further develops his plans and we<br>further develop our way of making sure<br>those plans get across the campus yeah<br>good I I really appreciate that work<br>you've been doing um because it gets it<br>something else that that we really want<br>and that is to to break down barriers uh<br>remove silos and also find the support<br>that we need for teaching uh our<br>university has so much support out there<br>uh from professional staff but sometimes<br>it's hard to know who to ask or where to<br>get it or even that it exists uh so this<br>you know building a relationship with<br>Ryan is is a great way illustration of<br>how we might go about that um sorry can<br>I say something I would really love to<br>connect with Ryan um so he I I think he<br>is U like focusing on the physical<br>learning environment and um um we are<br>like one of the um digital learning team<br>um support he science division but we<br>sort of like focusing on the digital<br>learning environment I think we can like<br>learn from each other like provide um um<br>much better like learning experience for<br>students like there's probably can go um<br>integrate from physical learning<br>environment and like how to um connect<br>with the digital learning and provide<br>like simless learning experience um yeah<br>to students yeah I would like to discuss<br>forther thanks I think the other the<br>other element that comes to us that<br>comes to mind as well is there's<br>problems and some conundrums out there<br>as well that different groups around the<br>teaching spaces and and how we interact<br>together are are battling with and<br>thinking through and the more people<br>that can be brought in I guess to to<br>listen to ideas and and to see where the<br>you know goals and solutions are in<br>heading in a good direction gives those<br>people who are doing some great work<br>some real confidence that their work is<br>is going to and and will uh really I<br>guess you know solve some of these you<br>know these conundrums that these<br>individual groups are faced with and if<br>they are solved and we find better ways<br>of doing things and we can assist in<br>that way of of being a sounding board<br>and and just thinking of their own<br>experience over lay on to maybe what<br>they're thinking about is what's is to<br>come then you can also see them walk<br>away go right we're on the right track<br>here let's keep going with this and this<br>will be valued and I'm confident that in<br>that example I explained before there'll<br>be some real value yeah good Ben thank<br>you so let let me ask you um start with<br>you on this one Ben um what we've been<br>trying to convey I guess is that this is<br>for the benefit of Staff right um Joe<br>you said it it's not just one more thing<br>to do that's not what it's about um but<br>how can staff make the most of this like<br>here's an opportunity what what what<br>what does it do you think being for for<br>for our teaching and professional staff<br>to be you know a part of the<br>network I think that if they it's a<br>choice in terms of people wanting to<br>utilize some of the outputs and outcomes<br>of what we're seeking to do and so for<br>those who are are looking for something<br>it could be just a little element that<br>they're looking for that they've been<br>you know annoyed about or frustrated<br>about for a while and maybe it it pops<br>up in the network and our in our wider<br>workings and our offerings and that<br>might just be something that someone's<br>been really really looking for and if we<br>can assist with that then terrific if<br>someone out there is looking maybe as a<br>as a a new staff member and it's It's<br>Tricky and trying to understand the<br>machine that is the University and the<br>way in which we teach and we organize<br>ourselves then of course there's lots in<br>the space for people in in that uh<br>particular um area to to to to gain from<br>us and so I think it's it's about the<br>individual and what they need and what<br>they're looking for and there will be<br>things that will pop up pop along the<br>way that will capture anybody's<br>attention and there will be lots of<br>things that some people might also be<br>looking for depending upon where they're<br>at and and kind of where they're<br>progressing in their own minds around<br>their teaching and their and their time<br>on the campus and I think that's a<br>really exciting thing is particularly in<br>those people who are new I think we can<br>really lift them up earlier than maybe<br>we've ever done before to make<br>connections and therefore feel confident<br>and good to go rather than having to do<br>it themselves over a long period of time<br>and getting there but how about we get<br>them there a little quicker yeah it<br>reminds me of one of the values I think<br>of the digital platform um is that that<br>staff will be able to tailor it to our<br>interests uh we'll be able to just pick<br>what the conversations we want to follow<br>the activities that really um take our<br>imaginations uh find the help that we<br>need so I think that's that's going to<br>be brilliant when it arrives here so<br>chin what do you think uh is there for<br>staff to respond to um I think probably<br>as we discussed earlier um I see this<br>network um like we offering<br>opportunities but not imposing<br>requirements on people like um you<br>decide like on which level you want to<br>engage with this network I think<br>probably for us we decide to um<br>contribute more as the um K and and also<br>I think this network um this probably<br>ground up approach um has the<br>Transformer part probably can um like<br>like uh teaching staff feel um they can<br>make the learning their own like we can<br>tellor so let's say the the experience<br>or the Showcase we learn and from this<br>network from this platform and tell her<br>that um to meet like our specific needs<br>and also the context I think that's<br>like something like for me is very<br>important and also very exciting like<br>yeah just um to take the ownership of<br>our own learning and also the<br>professional development and use that as<br>a opportunity to learn from each other<br>and also we can support each other yeah<br>good thank you chin I appreciate that Jo<br>what would you say I would say I really<br>agree in terms of what bean and Chen<br>have been talking about in relation to<br>um staff can connect in as much or as<br>little as they'd like to in terms of<br>what they would like to get out of the<br>network or if they're even unsure of<br>what they could get out of theet Network<br>just to make the initial connection with<br>us so that we can help share what the<br>network is about and continue as we're<br>building it to be able to um share that<br>with you I think um for me and I'm sure<br>everybody else in their teaching roles<br>at the University of atago one of the<br>key things um that we're really mindful<br>of of is thinking about um Equity of<br>experience for our Learners in the<br>classroom and so this network helps to<br>provide a support to um engage with key<br>people at the University we've got M<br>here um as well who's part of the<br>network and it's been really great<br>meeting with you m as part of this uh in<br>terms of thinking about also our<br>obligations under<br>Tangi and um equity for our multi<br>students in the classroom and how we as<br>a network are ensuring that we're<br>meeting those obligations as well so I<br>think if staff are wondering we' got<br>questions around that too you know they<br>can connect with us and we can help be<br>conduits with people within the<br>university who um are supporting that<br>for our teaching yeah thank you Jo thank<br>you for acknowledging that that's great<br>Rebecca I think that connecting part is<br>is really for me the heart of it all um<br>so if if people want to know something<br>want to know of someone else is doing<br>something they want to learn about they<br>can get in touch and if I don't know I<br>can talk to Chen and Joe and say do you<br>know anyone else in our division if they<br>don't know I can say hey B is someone<br>doing this there so it's a way of using<br>us as a conduit through things um but I<br>also think as well it doesn't have to be<br>quite as as formal as that I think I can<br>speak for all of us when I say that get<br>in touch and have a chat with us um I<br>had um lunch with some some colleagues<br>from Health Sciences and Sciences and we<br>just chatted and came with some cool<br>ideas and realized that people were<br>doing things that we wanted to do and<br>that was just you know a nice casual<br>thing everyone has to have lunch so you<br>know actually having you know a break<br>and and talking and um another colle<br>colag said to me I like having teaching<br>friends they they're quite isolated<br>where they are L of people um around<br>them doing something similar and just<br>the fact that we could catch up for a<br>coffee and a chat and both be passionate<br>about the sort of thing I think it um it<br>was really positive both of us and I<br>think we' we'd all welcome that from<br>from anyone so um I think just encourage<br>people to to get in touch with us yes<br>definitely and I'm I'm really hearing<br>what you're saying in relation to<br>creating that supportive um culture<br>within the network and thinking<br>specifically around we've had a new<br>lecturing staff in our department um<br>start and what Bim was saying in<br>relation to people who perhaps have had<br>less experience with teaching how can<br>they lean into this network how can we<br>help support um them in that space uh<br>and you know sharing stories we all<br>remember what it was like when we first<br>started lecturing and what potentially<br>our first lecture was like I got stuck<br>in the back of my denim jacket couldn't<br>get off jumping around the lecture<br>theater with the microphone on um so<br>we've all got sort of stories like that<br>that we can share make us more human you<br>know more relatable more able to support<br>each other in our teaching um and and so<br>that we all enjoy our jobs more you know<br>and and get a lot out of it and in<br>saying that and and not just around new<br>teaching staff either we would like to<br>encourage people who have been you know<br>teaching for many many years as well to<br>come and share their expertise with us<br>to come and um be part of this network<br>yeah I think I think it's important<br>everyone has expertise you know no<br>matter where you are and the hierarchy<br>and experience everyone has experience<br>and expertise and things they've learned<br>and that is worth sharing we want to we<br>want to hear your stories we want to<br>hear from you we want to hear what what<br>you love doing what you want to<br>celebrate and also what the challenges<br>are because if we hear the same<br>challenges then maybe we can do<br>something about that yeah that's great<br>thank you and look I just want to<br>acknowledge too some um other support<br>that we haven't mentioned yet and that's<br>from HDC yes uh so we have dedicated<br>support staff from HDC who are able to<br>bring us into the world of higher<br>education research and provide quality<br>assurance and just good ideas and sound<br>ideas and best practice so um shout out<br>to them for the work they they they're<br>doing great work for the network and<br>we're all grateful for that what a great<br>discussion I want to widen our Co<br>uh to bring in some questions uh might<br>be questions from the audience in the<br>studio or online if you're online use<br>the chat function and uh let's let's see<br>what thoughts are out there uh that was<br>a really I think Illuminating glimpse<br>into the network as it is right now in<br>the studio online any questions for<br>us Cur Sarah Stein from distance<br>learning<br>um I'd like you to paint a picture for<br>me it's 2030<br>what's the University teaching and<br>learning environment like now due to the<br>work that the CER has done could you ask<br>a bigger question Sarah<br>like can you ask a who who wants to take<br>that one first oh I'll I'll go good um I<br>I would like my dream is that everyone<br>loves coming to work and and loves<br>everything that they're doing and sees<br>challenges as an opportunity need to<br>learn rather than uh what we sometimes<br>feel which is just barriers in place<br>that you feel a little bit isolated I'd<br>love that we're going to have much more<br>diversity in our students in 2030 and<br>I'm so excited for that and so being<br>responsive to that over you know the<br>next five or six years so that we can<br>create an environment that welcomes so<br>many diverse students and staff that's<br>that's my dream I think also um to build<br>on there as well diversity in terms of<br>teaching modality so um SAR now<br>obviously with um your<br>vast experience in distance um learning<br>and teaching around breaking down the<br>barriers of um I guess extending our<br>teaching so it's not sort of limited<br>necessarily to being within the four<br>walls of the classroom I think I see<br>more scope for that as we head um into<br>the future and thinking about how we as<br>a network can help facilitate that yeah<br>I think so just by having this<br>generative Ali conversation we' had over<br>the past month or so um people have gone<br>from going this is scary and I don't<br>want to know anything about it cuz I<br>don't see any relevance to going there<br>could be something really cool here and<br>I think people taking that on with<br>technology because who knows what<br>technology is going to be in 2030 and<br>being able to be prepared for that I<br>think is is very exciting yeah yeah<br>great um we we we we are in for big<br>changes in technology uh and and Sarah<br>at the least will'll be really making<br>the most of those opportunities to<br>really enhance the learning experience<br>of our students and there's more to say<br>hasn't there been I think so um I think<br>thinking about that time frame not only<br>what the campus necessarily looks like<br>in in terms of the teaching space but<br>the learner changing across that time<br>and there's been rapid change in our<br>Learners in you know sort of pre through<br>pandemic and post-pandemic type<br>situations and that's going to continue<br>to evolve and maybe instead of being<br>behind the change we want to be in front<br>of the change and really understand<br>these Learners better than we do at the<br>moment what they're looking for what we<br>can offer that makes them you know<br>excited and uh and motivated to be a<br>part of that learning space that could<br>be created in partnership with them<br>rather than for them and just making<br>sure that by the time we get to 2030<br>we've gone from behind and being<br>reactive to being really proactive in<br>the way in which we engage with our<br>students yeah and and can I be bold and<br>add that I think we can we can move to<br>be a leader in lots of these fields<br>steering The Walker rather than being<br>the tide yeah dri absolutely that was a<br>good thought thank you Ben<br>Jean um yeah I think that's a big<br>question uh I'm thinking about 2030 is<br>probably only six year away but<br>personally I probably want to say in six<br>year there will be um like a strong uh<br>Network and very like feel every day we<br>come to work and feel like very<br>connected and supported and I would love<br>to have more like teaching friends and<br>also probably imagine of the teaching um<br>I think I really want to say and<br>probably also this network and for<br>probably the next step we can hear more<br>from students and this is not just the<br>network um among teachers but also the<br>um Educators and the Learners yeah and<br>more<br>conversations yeah no that's exactly<br>right J thank you I mean in the end all<br>that we're talking about is for the<br>students the students of 2030 yes that's<br>right absolutely Joe do you want to add<br>anything uh I guess what I would add on<br>on the back of that as well as um an<br>acknowledgement for our Learners in<br>terms of how the context of the<br>environment that they're learning and<br>has changed so much in in recent years<br>and um in terms of the cost of living<br>being able to juggle you know um jobs as<br>well as study so thinking about as a<br>network into you know leading into 2030<br>and Beyond how we can help support that<br>um and I think that takes um support for<br>each other in terms of being more<br>flexible around how we think about how<br>we deliver our teaching yeah good one<br>thank you John I think we've got time<br>for one more<br>you k um it's Kate nox I'm a subject<br>librarian here on the denan campus um<br>you all sort of got a bit star eyed at<br>one point or another when you were<br>talking about ideas that you've heard of<br>your colleagues doing um across the<br>country in terms of effective teaching<br>strategies and I just wondered if you<br>could share a couple of examples so that<br>we can have a bit of a taste of the<br>types of things you discuss um in this<br>network good thank you a couple of<br>examples sure so just so um in terms of<br>the discussions that I've had with<br>colleagues in the chre campus um there's<br>a lot happening and developing in the<br>space with teaching around simulation uh<br>and lots that's really Progressive in<br>terms of thinking about it in an<br>interdisciplinary way so bringing<br>together um students from lots of the<br>different departments working um<br>medicine nursing physio seeing how we<br>can all come together there something<br>being developed currently which is<br>really exciting looking at an oncore<br>Ward simulation project that's taking um<br>teaching staff Educators um and students<br>actually uh from different disciplines<br>and bringing them together so that's<br>just in the development stages at the<br>moment but we've been having<br>conversations around what that's going<br>to look like and how that's going to<br>evolve so that's really exciting in that<br>space and I think uh in relation to some<br>of the conversations that we've been<br>having around the generative AI um some<br>of the and I'm not an expert in this<br>area at all but some of the things that<br>the um teaching staff are talking about<br>that they're using it for um in in terms<br>of one of the conversations I have with<br>someone um was around students actually<br>engaging in Ai and this particular<br>person said um oh well I actually expect<br>my students to engage in Ai and that was<br>a real shift for me because um I think<br>there's been a bit of a culture of the<br>unknown the fear is that allowed are we<br>even able to do that um so really just<br>um enhancing those sorts of um<br>conversations working out what's<br>happening in that space people are doing<br>such different things might pass on to<br>my colleagues in terms of more specific<br>examples about potentially what they're<br>doing um but it does allow for those<br>culture ships in terms of thinking about<br>how we can enhance our teaching in that<br>space<br>yeah don't know if I'm allowed to answer<br>but I was in a conversation last week uh<br>from with staff on the Christ Church<br>campus about uh virtual Escape rooms so<br>so these students were learning their<br>way around an emergency Department yes<br>online in a virtual environment but they<br>had to solve certain puzzles on the way<br>through I what a great idea right and<br>I'm thinking where could that translate<br>yeah you know out of a medical context<br>into different contexts and I think that<br>illustrates the power of this so so<br>there's there's a couple of examples and<br>there'll be more and I think the<br>exciting thing for me is that if we've<br>if we're seeing this level of enthusiasm<br>activity right now just you know really<br>a couple of months on from really<br>beginning to launch this thing imagine<br>the potential uh of these conversations<br>as they proliferate across other topics<br>and build on themselves over time and<br>build up those communities of Interest<br>so to come back to your question S I<br>just see huge potential uh for us to<br>really respond in a in a in a confident<br>agile way to developments over the next<br>years until 2030 and 2040 we're going to<br>be well placed with this network to<br>respond to all of those<br>challenges I just think that was a<br>fantastic discussion ordinarily i' I'd<br>thank the panel um but on behalf of the<br>panel I just want to thank uh you I want<br>to thank you uh if you're online or<br>watching the recording or in the studio<br>thank you for your time we're very<br>grateful aren we to Media production for<br>hosting us and looking after us so well<br>in engineering things thank you for that<br>it has been a really good discussion<br>look out for the next C carero but for<br>w</p></main><footer
