international students Kiora<br>my name is Megan Smith and Kiora I'm<br>Victoria mcari and we are delighted to<br>have you here today thanks very much for<br>joining us wherever you are in the world<br>uh and just a reminder that today our<br>webinar is indeed focused specifically<br>on Bachelor Degree studies uh so in case<br>you were hoping we'd talk about Master<br>degrees or other this is probably not<br>the webinar for you but you're very<br>welcome to hang with us and listen in in<br>any case uh we'd also like to thank all<br>of you who have submitted questions<br>already when you registered for the<br>webinar we'll be uh answering almost all<br>of those during our presentation content<br>and most of you probably if you have got<br>a question up your sleeve we're probably<br>going to have that covered in the slides<br>today too so do hang off uh asking any<br>live questions till maybe a bit later<br>when we do the live Q&amp;A and then we'll<br>be very happy to uh help you through the<br>live uh Q&amp;A chat function but today I am<br>we're very excited because it's not only<br>Victoria and I we are going to be joined<br>a little bit later by colleagues uh<br>including Ash Palin from our admissions<br>office uh and two of our current<br>fantastic International students Pamela<br>and Sid and they'll be here to join and<br>share with you uh some uh some of their<br>experiences about being an international<br>student at otago<br>now Victoria today's been an exciting<br>day today the University of itago very<br>proudly launched its new brand and what<br>that means is whilst our official name<br>stays the same the University of otago<br>we're really thrilled to introduce to<br>you our new Mai name Oto faku Waka which<br>has a metaphorical meaning of a place of<br>many firsts this is a special name<br>that's been gifted to us by our local<br>Mana fena or people indigenous people of<br>the land and it's a really special<br>moment for the University's history this<br>is the first significant change to our<br>brand in 155 years so having a beautiful<br>new M name is very exciting for us and<br>in addition you'll see we have a new<br>symbol uh in within the logo uh this is<br>called a tou and uh the symbol here is<br>reflective and inspired from our otago<br>Harbor and the two-way current that<br>flows in and out which reflects the<br>exchange and the uh the kind of uh in<br>and out of life and education and<br>sharing of knowledge uh that our<br>Province or region has always been<br>involved in uh and for which we welcome<br>you as an international student to join<br>in as well you'll also see in the<br>currents there are three lines they<br>represent the past the present and the<br>future and then there's a macron just on<br>top of the um on top of symbol and<br>that's a walker which we call it's a<br>canoe and uh that symbolizes that uh the<br>majority of students that come to otago<br>are traveling from um around New Zealand<br>and around the world and then they leave<br>otago as well just like you would on a<br>walker leaving the harbor so we're<br>really delighted to celebrate and<br>welcome you to the University of too's<br>New Brand which was launched<br>today okay moving on with got quite the<br>large agenda so we're going to jump in<br>and crack into it directly so we'll kick<br>start with an introduction to New<br>Zealand uh Al uh we are a beautiful<br>country of five million people we have<br>three official languages English Tero<br>Mai our indigenous language and in fact<br>New Zealand sign language globally we're<br>ranked very highly in the world across a<br>number of important indicators we are<br>the third least corrupt country in the<br>world the fourth safest country in the<br>world good one for your parents to know<br>we're the fourth most gender equal in<br>the world we're considered one of the<br>most prosperous countries in the world<br>uh 11th happiest it's always a good one<br>I think they should be higher I think it<br>should too we're having a good time here<br>and uh also we rate well in the<br>sustainability competitive index uh as<br>well now uh we are also known for our uh<br>beautiful indigenous culture our Mali<br>people and many of the uh values that<br>are shared through that culture culture<br>is are something that you will<br>experience as an international student<br>too and in particular we like to refer<br>to manaki Tanga which is a value or<br>principle of kindness and Hospitality<br>generosity and support and those are<br>really important to us as a country and<br>particularly as a university in<br>welcoming you as an international<br>student it's handy to know that when you<br>consider New Zealand as a study<br>destination that in fact all eight<br>universities are very highly ranked in<br>the world we're also the number one<br>english- speaking country in the world<br>and in fact the third in the world uh<br>overall for preparing students for the<br>future uh we have a world-class<br>education and we focus on attributes<br>such as critical thinking Hands-On<br>learning working collaboratively problem<br>solving and being creative in fact uh<br>New Zealand is known as being the second<br>best in the world at producing graduates<br>with problem solving skills which is<br>really what uh the world needs so uh<br>it's great also to know that<br>research-wise New Zealand universities<br>offer very good excellent research uh um<br>uh opportunities and collaboration with<br>universities around the world and of a<br>special note New Zealand was the first<br>country of all to introduce a strict<br>code of practice to ensure the welfare<br>and looking after International students<br>our education too is recognized around<br>the world too so even coming and doing<br>your Bachelor is a great stepping stone<br>if you want to go and do postgraduate<br>overseas afterwards that's yeah so where<br>are we we are in the most beautiful city<br>of denan in the South<br>Island uh the two main International<br>gateways in New Zealand uh our<br>international airports in Oakland and<br>Christ church and then we're just a<br>flight just just under an hour's flight<br>from Oakland I big pound under two hours<br>from Oakland and 1 hour from Christ<br>church so denan is a UNESCO city of art<br>and literature but we're also a student<br>city and what we mean by student City<br>means we've got a very strong Town gown<br>relationship where the when the<br>university is open and over you know 25<br>students arrive to study here New<br>Zealand statistics says we have the<br>highest number of students between or<br>people between the ages of 18 and 23 in<br>one area so it's very<br>condensed um as you can see 84% of<br>people when um surveyed say that they<br>rate their quality of life of good or<br>extremely good and being a University<br>City we attract New Zealand's highest<br>con concentration of post-graduate<br>qualifications that's 36% of people have<br>an postgraduate education all our<br>academic staff must have at least a PhD<br>basically if you live in denan you<br>either work at the University or you<br>know someone that works at the<br>University but also living out of a big<br>city from away from a big city means<br>there are the lower costs of living here<br>there's a real sort of 15 minute City<br>you can walk everywhere from the campus<br>into the city um and the flats and<br>living uh it's very you know more<br>affordable but it's a great lifestyle<br>being a UNESCO city of art and<br>literature we've got wonderful art<br>festivals Fringe festivals fashion ID we<br>we attract International sporting<br>festivals and concerts because of this<br>High concentration of young<br>people so we're a very temperate climate<br>you're going to see Four Seasons<br>beautiful spring those are the Japanese<br>blossom trees that um come here um<br>summertime uh you've got to try an ice<br>cream New Zealand ice cream is the best<br>ice cream in the world and over 20<br>beaches very close by to us so lots to<br>choose from for that uh Beach experience<br>definitely right now we're just<br>finishing Autumn that's my favorite<br>season it's just beautiful with the<br>golds and the Reds and the oranges of<br>the trees changing and then we'll be<br>heading into um winter of course<br>southern hemisphere is different to the<br>Northern Hemisphere and you might get to<br>see the wonderful Aurora<br>Australis uh you'll get to see wonderful<br>Wildlife like the little penguins as<br>well as seals and Albatross and you<br>might even get a little sprinkling of<br>snow just to be clear that snow doesn't<br>hang around if we do get snow it's very<br>exciting it typically makes national<br>news uh and it's all gone later in that<br>day so uh the snow we reserve for our<br>mountains where we like to go skiing<br>yeah so we're a coastal town um<br>absolutely beautiful compact as you can<br>see the university is what we call in<br>north deden and goes right into the City<br>and the city has mus Museums Art<br>Galleries shops restaurants cafes and<br>there's something for<br>everyone um wonderful big selection of<br>different food Outlets um you can see<br>those two women are coming through from<br>our our um airport there which is about<br>30 minutes away from the center of the<br>city and a variety of international<br>restaurants and cafes as well to very<br>much to soup the international students<br>who join us at the University and<br>academic as well that's right and<br>remember the University of Oto is called<br>after the region of Oto and we call<br>Central otaro is 3 and 1 half to 4 hours<br>driveway um there you can see that's uh<br>wanica um that's actually one of our<br>colleagues on Roy's Peak is it you could<br>be doing that so you could be say skiing<br>in the morning uh King in the afternoon<br>for example and you can experience some<br>of the best famous world famous hikes um<br>in the south island so there's a lot<br>that you can do that's right on our<br>doorstep we are the Gateway denan is the<br>Gateway in the central Oto but we're<br>here to talk actually about the<br>University of Oto yes it's time to get<br>serious everyone so let's talk a little<br>bit more about the University of atago<br>and why you might consider studying with<br>us so first off we are New Zealand's<br>first University we are uh we were<br>established in 1869 we have a very proud<br>history and as of today a very proud uh<br>and evolved new uh brand as well uh at<br>otago you uh will be taught by some of<br>our um absolutely incredible academics<br>who are uh nationally recognized and<br>internationally recognized the<br>university uh is indeed ranked among the<br>world's top 1% of universities uh and<br>well respected uh around the world<br>globally New Zealand uh we are also New<br>Zealand's top University for Education<br>performance we have around 21,000<br>students and over 2 and a half thousand<br>are international coming from over 90<br>countries uh we offer a large number of<br>study options a very very expansive<br>range of courses that you can take with<br>us and a lot of flexibility to create<br>the degree degree that suits you what's<br>really important of course are outcomes<br>and 95% of our graduates go directly<br>into work or on graduate or further<br>study uh so you can be confident uh of<br>good results and we have the Five Star<br>Plus International Quality rating from<br>Qs other reasons to consider a Targo are<br>that we are New Zealand's only true<br>residential University 86% of our<br>students come from outside of our city<br>denan that means they're all moving down<br>like you would be from overseas coming<br>together on a campus with accommodation<br>is all in one place all together across<br>the one campus and this creates a<br>fantastic and very unique residential<br>campus environment for uh for you to<br>study to socialize and to connect and<br>establish your network there are over<br>150 student Le clubs and societies we<br>have very high student satisfaction uh<br>in our student surveys across all uh<br>indicators and we have a fantastic uh<br>it's friendly campus watch team who are<br>there to just keep an eye and make sure<br>the campus is thriving that our staff<br>and our students are feeling safe and<br>happy uh in a in a pleasant environment<br>now my favorite ranking of course is<br>that we have a really beautiful campus<br>in fact it's ranked among uh well it's<br>been considered the fifth most beautiful<br>uh according to the Times Higher<br>Education student voice uh 22 survey but<br>truly there is no other campus like it<br>in New Zealand or even really within<br>Australia either this is a stunning<br>campus and it's a very easy place to<br>come and live and study as a<br>student now rankings are very important<br>to many uh and they are a useful<br>indicator of quality and that is<br>something that ataro offers you we are<br>currently ranked 206th best in the world<br>uh out of a field of I think there's<br>something like 15,000 internationally<br>recognized<br>institutes we are ranked in the top 50<br>in a number of subjects but really great<br>to highlight Sports Sciences we are 12th<br>best in the world Anatomy 30th the MBA<br>online 37th best Dentistry which by the<br>way we're the only Dentistry School in<br>New Zealand we're ranked 40th best in<br>the world uh and tourism 44th best but<br>the point here is you'll see a range of<br>subject areas uh ranked within the top<br>200 in the world and what a diversity of<br>subject areas that reflects the breadth<br>and depth of research and academic<br>Excellence that is offered by our uh<br>fantastic academic colleagues in terms<br>of teaching and taught by experts that's<br>for<br>sure all right so what can you study at<br>aago okay so our Bachelor degrees are<br>based on like the British system of the<br>majority of our Bachelor degrees are<br>three years we uh do have the double<br>degree options as well which we'll talk<br>about a little bit later and basically<br>under if you're doing a three-year<br>Bachelor then usually students will have<br>at least one major subject<br>and you also take a minor subject so<br>that just sort of um basically allows<br>you to um take subjects from across<br>different divisions with your major<br>subject uh the academic divisions that<br>we have here are Health Sciences science<br>business Humanities and then we've got a<br>pathway in English Language Center and<br>we're going to Deep dive into these a<br>little bit more and talk about the<br>different sort of major subjects so<br>first off the block Health Sciences<br>so we have a range of um wonderful<br>professional programs um under our<br>Health Sciences bachelor's degree so<br>listed here are the degrees the<br>professional programs that lead to<br>registration Bachelor of medical<br>laboratory science is a 4-year degree<br>Pharmacy four Years Physiotherapy four<br>years Dentistry is 5 years and we have<br>the oldest and largest medical um<br>surgery program which is six years now<br>there is no direct entry from high<br>schools but I'm going to explain<br>basically how this<br>works yeah and a couple more slides so<br>also we have the Bachelor of oral health<br>three years and Bachelor of dental<br>technology these are both professional<br>programs that lead to registration and<br>you can come in straight from high<br>school into these two programs please<br>note the applications for these two<br>programs will open on the 1st of August<br>and close on the 15th of September and<br>you apply under the health science<br>profession um and then you choose either<br>oral health and dental technology but<br>please you know email us we'll have our<br>contact details at the end and we can<br>give you more information on these if<br>you need more information um we also<br>have our um three-year direct entry<br>Health Science Bachelor degrees um for<br>under Health Sciences public health is a<br>very popular program we have biomed<br>Sciences with quite a few different<br>endorsements and we're the only<br>University in New Zealand to offer The<br>Bachelor of pharmaceutical sciences and<br>there's a real graduate opportunities<br>and and bit of a shortage there in the<br>market for that certainly a strong<br>International um internationally<br>recognized and sought after degree we do<br>under our Bachelor of Science also have<br>health rated Majors such as genetics<br>Anatomy human nutrition and microbiology<br>so let's go back first of all to um if<br>you're wanting to go into one of those<br>professional programs what is your first<br>step and we call it at Oto Health<br>Sciences first year think of it as<br>one-year Premed pre- Dentistry pre-<br>Pharmacy physiotherapy medical<br>laboratory okay and basically so from<br>high school you will apply for Health<br>Sciences first year and we are going to<br>uh you get seven compulsory papers<br>subjects that all students will then<br>compete with one another to get into<br>these uh professional programs look<br>we're not going to spend much time of<br>that because on the 18th of June we've<br>got a webinar dedicated to undergraduate<br>health science programs um Health<br>Science first year we'll have academics<br>talking as well as students Etc so um<br>lock lock that one in okay when it comes<br>to the science es uh Victoria alluded to<br>uh of course Sciences relating very much<br>to the health industry uh as well as a<br>range of other Sciences across the<br>Spectrum and really there's just so much<br>choice in science and certainly atago is<br>a great place to study science we have<br>both fabulous uh and excellent<br>Laboratories and Facilities but we also<br>have a very natural laboratory right on<br>our doorstep covering glaciers and<br>mountains and harbors and uh and all<br>sorts of things so if Marine Sciences of<br>Interest goodness this is a terrific<br>place to come and study among many other<br>topics geography and geology<br>Etc what's terrific about our science<br>academics is that many of them are<br>actually World leading in their<br>particular discipline and we also have<br>access to some rather unique field sites<br>for our environmental Sciences we have a<br>lot of flexibility in the science<br>degrees to combine with other subjects<br>uh and also in terms of your first year<br>to explore and and find exactly where<br>you want to land and where you want to<br>develop and deepen your<br>knowledge uh you get a chance as a<br>student studying science to participate<br>and learn in a really strong environment<br>of cuttingedge research projects uh and<br>indeed it's possible to start a science<br>degree both in our February intake and<br>our July intake it's possible to<br>complete a science degree within 3 years<br>the entry requirements for our Science<br>degrees are very straightforward<br>completed upper Secondary High School<br>that allows University entrance plus<br>English language uh with a minimum uh<br>iots overall band overall score of<br>6.0 uh we're going to come back to<br>scholarships and deadlines a little bit<br>later but it's worth noting that in<br>addition to the Bachelor of Science<br>degree and under which there are many<br>many specializations or Majors that you<br>can take we also have the specialist<br>degree of a bachelor of surveying yes<br>which is a four-year program and indeed<br>tago is the only uh University providing<br>uh such a program that's actually<br>recognized for the professional surveys<br>uh working as a professional server in<br>New Zealand yeah we we don't have a<br>College of Engineering but we do have<br>surveying and surveyors must work with<br>Engineers when they're developing those<br>those those bridges um forming tunnels<br>Etc um so there's very very good<br>graduate opportunities<br>there let's get down to business let's<br>get down to business<br>we've got a wonderful Oto School of<br>Business um you can see there some of<br>the majors um we uh our School of<br>Business is ranked number one for<br>research in New Zealand um these are the<br>majors that you can see on the left and<br>we also have some miners that you can<br>take as well there's a really handsome<br>uh person in the photo that I see on<br>that screen is that I feel like we might<br>come to meet that student it would be<br>really nice maybe they could join us on<br>this webinar<br>letter well spotted so a a typical<br>Bachelor of Commerce is 3 years now what<br>we haven't mentioned is honors and I<br>know a lot of you in your own countries<br>do have degrees with um a bachelor<br>degree with honors and at otago yes we<br>do but honors is we see that as postgrad<br>so you don't apply for a bachelor of<br>Commerce in honors until your final year<br>of your degree for example um I also<br>want to point out we've got Phil opy<br>politics and economics PPE a triple<br>Major we're the only University to have<br>this as a major and there's not many<br>universities in the world only very you<br>know top universities that do have this<br>major within Commerce and we also have<br>it within arts and don't forget tourism<br>we are extremely highly red in tourism<br>we are sure we certainly are we've also<br>we the only University to offer a<br>three-year Bachelor of<br>Entrepreneurship now this is a fabulous<br>qualification I'm always um when I'm<br>overseas<br>I meet um students and their parents and<br>uh dad says I want to send my son and<br>daughter overseas to learn business but<br>we've got our own company our own<br>business and I want my child to take<br>over the business in the future perfect<br>for this type of<br>scenario um it is a business that has<br>focuses on strong links in Industry<br>community and global economy um and we<br>have startup spaces Innovation<br>organizations nonprofit social and<br>environmental um<br>Enterprises right let's jump under the<br>humanities and arts and social sciences<br>again a real spread of subject offerings<br>whether it's peace and conflict or<br>languages or teaching or indigenous<br>studies or the likes of history and so<br>forth there are over 40 majes that you<br>can choose from and again it's a<br>flexible degree where you can uh kind of<br>combine subjects uh we have two intakes<br>a year February and July uh uh and um<br>certainly Arts graduates do important<br>things I must say and they really<br>contribute to society and the skills<br>that you get from an arts degree are so<br>applicable across many many sectors in<br>addition to the Bachelor of Arts The<br>threeyear Bachelor we also have the<br>specialist degree a bachelor of teaching<br>and uh at the University of atago our<br>College of Education has a very long and<br>proud history of producing New Zealand's<br>teachers uh and we specializ in early<br>childhood uh primary school and<br>secondary school uh in terms of<br>international student interests for um<br>those tracks uh now it's worth noting<br>that there is a higher English language<br>requirement to get into The Bachelor of<br>teaching uh and also this has a<br>selective limited Place uh um admission<br>process so you will be competing to<br>secure a place in that particular<br>program and again a special deadline uh<br>that program has a earlier deadline of<br>30th of<br>August now we also have the Bachelor of<br>laws uh we have a very um prestigious<br>law school here atago the laws degree is<br>four years and again um this program is<br>interesting because anyone can have a go<br>at the first year of the laws program<br>and then you compete to move on to the<br>uh into the formal second year third and<br>fourth year of the degree<br>program now what's nice about at Taro is<br>we also offer you the opportunity to do<br>a combined degree so you may be very<br>interested in Majors from our Arts and<br>Commerce well you can take a combined<br>degree and Achieve that in four years<br>with a major from the Arts and a major<br>from Commerce or a Bachelor of Arts and<br>Science or a bachelor of Commerce and<br>science so this is a great way for those<br>of you with uh kind of broad interests<br>and you want to combine two degrees<br>quickly uh to achieve that with two<br>majors across a combined<br>degree the other lovely thing about a t<br>is we are partners with many many<br>universities around the world giving you<br>as an international student here at<br>atago the opportunity to further<br>globalize your degree by studying a<br>semester or two at one of our partner<br>universities and a global exchange a<br>student exchange is a very enriching<br>opportunity uh so you can have a degree<br>from the University of atago but perhaps<br>with one semester from University of<br>Copenhagen or a un one semester at<br>University Toronto in Canada for<br>instance so that's a handy tip for you<br>to further globalize your bachelor<br>degree that applies to most of our<br>programs<br>yes right so we get a lot of um<br>questions asking what's it like to study<br>at the University it's very different to<br>high school so this is a good example of<br>the lectures in your first year they<br>could be quite large lectures but by<br>your second and third as you're starting<br>to specialize they do come down in size<br>so you usually have maybe two lectures a<br>week and then you have tutorials as part<br>of that paper that unit module so these<br>tutorials allow you to have smaller<br>group sessions to discuss the lectures<br>that have taken place with either a<br>tutor which could be your lecturer or<br>senior<br>students also as um Megan also pointed<br>out with Sciences or social sciences um<br>you do get the exper experience to go<br>out in the field uh we've got amazing<br>facilities from our own ship from Marine<br>Science um surveying wonderful archology<br>sites<br>Etc uh we might have beautiful old<br>buildings but we've got state-of-the-art<br>facilities as well this is the Mellow<br>Labs that you can see you can see<br>students are all learning with iPads um<br>basically this is the most modern sort<br>of uh Laboratories that you can<br>get right scholarship many of you are<br>joining us today to learn about those<br>opportunities and we're going to jump<br>right in so International students who<br>are offshore we offer a new and enhanced<br>Suite of scholarships for 2025 first off<br>we have the vice Chancellor

be considered<br>for international scholarships yes yes<br>would be your answer and that's all it<br>takes for that one now please note it is<br>not possible to have both a vice<br>Chancellor International Scholarship and<br>uh a global scholarship so if you're<br>from one of the countries listed in this<br>slide this would be the scholarship you<br>would be uh seeking to<br>receive we are also very excited to<br>introduce the new University of itago<br>international academic Excellence<br>scholarship this is for high achieving<br>International students who have studied<br>offshore and who will be joining us for<br>a full bachelor degree again starting in<br>25 or 26 now the value of this<br>scholarship is approximately $ 35,000<br>New Zealand Dollars which comprises of<br>covering your first year of<br>accommodation uh and then in your second<br>year $7,000 scholarship of tuition and<br>in your third year a further $7,000 off<br>your tuition subject to you completing a<br>certain GPA level to maintain that now<br>this of course is a competitive<br>selection scholarship uh and it requires<br>you uh to complete additional<br>application questions and that will be<br>assessed by a panel um what is exciting<br>is that it is possible to hold both a<br>global scholarship and the international<br>academic excellence<br>or a vice Chancellor and the<br>international academic Excellence<br>scholarships which means that<br>potentially if you are a high achieving<br>academic student you could potentially<br>receive a total combined scholarship uh<br>two scholarships of a total combin value<br>reaching up to 50,000 New Zealand<br>Dollars wow so you can double dip as<br>they say you can double dip if you are a<br>high achieving international student uh<br>if you are selected uh into this one<br>here so that's pretty exciting and<br>encouraging so the big question is well<br>what's a high achiever typically this<br>refers to the top 1 to 5% of achievers<br>uh of of the applicants um and more<br>broadly we would probably typically be<br>expecting at least to see a gpa<br>equivalent of 80% or an A minus at least<br>but there may be other circumstances<br>that contribute to uh the overall<br>picture so how do you apply for this one<br>well you'll recall the earlier steps uh<br>of of ticking yes when asked if you'd<br>like to be considered for a scholarship<br>so what happens is a little bit after<br>that once you receive an admission offer<br>and you'll either be offered a vice<br>Chancellor scholarship or a global<br>scholarship if you are eligible uh you<br>will then be asked to accept that<br>scholarship and the answer there would<br>be I accept and then you will be<br>prompted and invited would you like to<br>apply for the international academic<br>Excellence scholarship at which point if<br>you can consider yourself a high<br>achiever you would you would say yes and<br>that will prompt you and take you<br>through to a series of three key<br>questions asking for a little bit more<br>information about your academic<br>leadership Community involvement and the<br>opportunity to uh add any additional<br>relevant information and that will be<br>considered by a panel the panel will be<br>meeting on a regular basis and uh those<br>results will come out a little later so<br>hopefully that makes sense but gosh what<br>an opportunity uh in terms of uh<br>scholarship at that level now we're also<br>excited to share that we have another<br>new scholarship which is the<br>international partner scholarships and<br>this is uh applicable to International<br>students who are applying to aaro<br>through one of our established uh<br>articulation agreements uh that is<br>whereby you're studying your degree at<br>another University and there is an<br>agreement for you to transfer into our<br>degree program to complete the degree uh<br>and uh in that case you need to complete<br>at least four semesters with us and if<br>so you are able to be considered for<br>this scholarship worth $10,000 off your<br>first year of the T of tuition at<br>otago again answer yes if asked would<br>you like to be considered for an<br>International<br>Scholarship oky doie in case we've got<br>any new uh students who are already here<br>in New Zealand and a New Zealand high<br>school or New Zealand Foundation program<br>you also have access to a range of<br>scholarships through our OT<br>undergraduate entrance scholarships you<br>must actively apply in a specific<br>application period 1st of July to 15th<br>of August this is the same process as<br>your domestic students in your class<br>it's one single application and you'll<br>be considered for a range of<br>scholarships and they value anywhere<br>from 10K to 35,000 as well that's just<br>for the New Zealand students in a New<br>Zealand high school or New Zealand uh<br>Foundation program fantastic<br>now lastly uh there is the there are the<br>manari New Zealand scholarships and<br>these are government funded full<br>scholarships often uh they are largely<br>focused on postgraduate study but there<br>are some countries that are eligible to<br>apply for bachelor degrees and<br>potentially be considered for a full<br>scholarship so it's worth having a look<br>at the monari scholarship web page but<br>please note they only have one<br>application each year and that's in<br>February for the following Academic Year<br>so you've just missed uh for 25 but you<br>could start planning for<br>26 last of all in case we have any us<br>students on the line uh the University<br>of atago is an approved Institute for<br>the US government uh loans or ffsa uh<br>and so uh that's something worth<br>considering as<br>well now tuition fees uh tuition fees<br>very very much depending on the program<br>that you are looking to apply for our<br>foundation and diploma programs that we<br>haven't talked about in this particular<br>webinar but that just gives you a an<br>indication there but the main point was<br>our undergraduate Bachelor degrees so<br>for most of our degrees the range of<br>tuition uh is anywhere from around $<br>35,000 New Zealand dollars per year up<br>to about $43,000 New Zealand dollars per<br>year typically the<br>humanities uh are and business are kind<br>of in that uh 35 37,000 bracket and the<br>sciences and Health Sciences more toward<br>that 40 kind of, 43 depending on the<br>particular major and indeed the<br>particular modules or courses that you<br>take within your degree the professional<br>programs like medicine Dentistry<br>Pharmacy physiotherapy midlab s are more<br>than 43,000 that is<br>true oky dokie how do we apply very easy<br>Okay so we've got the four steps there<br>and we've also got that QR code too<br>first of all I want to let you know no<br>application fee woohoo so what you're<br>going to do is go onto our website our<br>brand new website um of the logos um and<br>you're going to check your entrance<br>requirements under future students and<br>international you're going to select<br>your program that you would like to<br>study and then you'll see an apply now<br>big yellow button click on that and<br>that's going to take you through to what<br>we call evision or your student portal<br>basically you log in uh you create your<br>own account and that's going to be your<br>student portal you then complete the<br>application you just follow the steps um<br>and the questions as they come up you're<br>going to upload your documents your ID<br>passport Etc as well as your transcripts<br>uh if you're going to use an education<br>consultant get them certified or make<br>sure they're from your high school<br>letterhead and then basically you submit<br>um there are some programs that might<br>ask for extra documents um but that will<br>uh lead you through the application<br>process now in case you're an education<br>consultant on the line with us this<br>afternoon just a reminder uh to uh that<br>you would log into your agent portal uh<br>to start a new application uh and that<br>you will need to create an evision<br>account for your student always use the<br>students email address please always<br>that really helps everyone and<br>everything and at all points in the<br>process and again complete and submit<br>the<br>application yes I think that's it uh<br>that's that right so the New Zealand<br>Academic Year um semester 1 kicks off in<br>25 now we're in New Zealand so we start<br>in our summer which is in February so uh<br>the key date really is that the 16th of<br>February is when you want to be here<br>ready for the orientation week and start<br>of studies uh in late February the 24th<br>of February<br>uh whereas semester 2 has a start in<br>July which is our winter and you finish<br>up in November for that semester there<br>is a summer school there but that's<br>largely intended for our current<br>students who are looking to catch up or<br>take an extra paper in the<br>summer so here is the big takeaway when<br>should you apply you should apply<br>starting now today the 1 of May uh we<br>have opened applications for 2025 today<br>uh and in the main most program have a<br>deadline of 15th of November for studies<br>starting in February next year however<br>there are a handful of programs with an<br>earlier deadline or special application<br>date so please remember if you're<br>interested in applying for The Bachelor<br>of teaching you need to do that before<br>the end of August and if you're<br>interested in applying for The Bachelor<br>of oral health or dental technology you<br>need to do that before 15th of September<br>so plenty of time to get your official<br>transcripts um before you apply oh<br>applying early is always fantastic you<br>get your offer you can start planning<br>for all of your costs and uh Logistics<br>and just make the whole process<br>smother righty ho undergraduate academic<br>entry requirements uh in order to get<br>into the University of atago and a<br>bachelor degree in the main this will<br>depend a little bit on which education<br>system and country and which you have<br>studied but effectively we need<br>completed upper secondary school studies<br>that would allow you into University<br>level uh uh and we also accept the<br>following International qualifications<br>which is the I diploma you'll note that<br>it's a relatively low score so um 24 is<br>a minimum uh and the A Levels uh with<br>your top three subjects with at least a<br>total combined uh number of eight uh or<br>indeed An approved Foundation studies<br>certificate now sometimes we get the<br>question why only 24 for the IB or that<br>seems low but that reflects the<br>philosophy of New Zealand's education<br>and indeed um the university which is<br>education is for everybody and everyone<br>should have the opportunity to prove<br>themselves so we do like to have the<br>door open to allow everyone to to prove<br>themselves and access education that's<br>right for those programs that are<br>competitive uh we would expect um higher<br>scores but we' talk with about that more<br>detail especially in the Health Sciences<br>webinar when it comes to English most<br>bachelor degree programs require an I's<br>overall score of 6.0 with no band under<br>5.5 uh however two of our programs do<br>have a higher level requirement as<br>listed there social work and teaching<br>requiring a<br>seven and in case you don't meet these<br>entry requirements it's okay we have<br>options for you one you can join our<br>University of atago foundation studies<br>certificate in order to boost your<br>academic qualification which will allow<br>entrance into the University<br>uh or in case you just missed University<br>entrance just off you can access our new<br>atago University diplomas these are a<br>level five New Zealand qualification we<br>have a diploma in arts a diploma in<br>Commerce and a diploma in science and<br>these are for sort of near Miss<br>University entrance students where you<br>have an intense one year to cover some<br>Preparatory and first year papers and a<br>successful completion allows you to<br>directly enter the second year of the<br>bachelor so don't lose any time we also<br>have English language studies available<br>to help boost your English language uh<br>proficiency and get you access into the<br>university and there are scholarships<br>for these studies as<br>well okay it's time to bring in our<br>guest and a warm welcome<br>Ash Ash is from our admissions office<br>and we are very happy to have you join<br>us today we get a lot of questions about<br>admission and we are going to address<br>some of those together with you so thank<br>you for joining<br>so first question Ash um we we're<br>looking to address some common<br>application questions and the first one<br>is what are some top tips for my<br>application um the first thing would be<br>to apply early um the sooner you submit<br>an application to us the sooner that we<br>can start processing and make sure that<br>you have all the documents that we need<br>in order to to get you your offer um<br>that's sort of the central thing um yeah<br>yeah early start people and you can<br>already apply today so that's a great<br>first tip this is another common<br>question we receive I haven't got my I<br>outs test uh can I still apply or do I<br>have to wait before I apply um you can<br>apply without um English language<br>proficiency scores already um we'll<br>request them from you after you apply<br>but um as long as you get them to us<br>prior to the deadline um it isn't a<br>problem um it's more important to have<br>your identity<br>documentation and um hopefully your high<br>school results and people can receive a<br>conditional offer until such time as<br>they get their a is that right yes um we<br>issue a condition conditional offer<br>which means that um once we receive your<br>final results we'll be able to issue<br>with the um final offer that allows you<br>entry immediately Perfect all right the<br>favorite question of our education<br>consultants and our students how long<br>should I have to wait for an admission<br>offer what's the turnaround time okay so<br>um it depends on whether you've applied<br>with all of your documents if you have<br>then it should be pretty much<br>immediately um within a week um when it<br>comes to if you haven't supplied your I<br>scores or have other documentation that<br>you still need to supply then we won't<br>be able to issue your final offer until<br>after you've already given that to us um<br>which we will request through your<br>evision portal um and once you supply<br>that documentation once again it would<br>be um at most a week before you should<br>expect an offer fantastic okay now what<br>happens after I've submitted an<br>application what's happening at your end<br>what's going on um so we receive it we<br>uh look over all of the information that<br>you've put into um the required fields<br>and we request any information that you<br>haven't haven't already supplied if you<br>have tertiary study um you need need to<br>uh you need to input those details um<br>into that section otherwise it will hold<br>up the process um then we look at your<br>qualification firstly and we want to<br>make sure that it is up to the standards<br>um that we have it meets requirements um<br>then your ID identity documentation<br>matches um with your with whatever your<br>high your high school or tertiary<br>documents are and then your English<br>proficiency and once we've seen that you<br>meet all those requirements you're ready<br>for an offer great so this is another<br>good question because atago offers so<br>many uh different programs uh how many<br>programs can people apply for in one<br>application um you can apply for up to<br>three different bachelor's programs um<br>but each of those programs would have to<br>so you can't apply for a Bachelor of<br>Science in with one set of majors and<br>then also another Bachelor of Science<br>with a different set of Majors it would<br>have to be different programs okay so<br>you could apply for a Bachelor of<br>Science with microbiology as a major if<br>you wanted to also apply for a Bachelor<br>of Science with genetics as a major can<br>you do that um no not that stage unless<br>you want to double major at the same<br>time so it comes down to the degree<br>program you can apply for up to three<br>different degree programs but just<br>choose one major in that application but<br>you change the major later on right yes<br>absolutely<br>perfect okay what about if you do choose<br>say a Bachelor of Science and a bachelor<br>of Commerce do you have to prioritize<br>and let like indicate I prefer this one<br>or um because the entry requirements for<br>um those programs are the same we<br>wouldn't uh we would be able to issue<br>with an you with an offer for both and<br>at that point you would decide which one<br>you want to continue with great so you<br>can receive several offers back yes mhm<br>good now this is a favorite one you<br>mentioned identification document before<br>and sometimes we do get asked why do I<br>have to certify my passport what's this<br>about why can't I just scan it upload it<br>and be done with it um well when you<br>apply you can um essentially but in<br>order for you to be en enrolled<br>officially as a student um you have to<br>be uh ticked off on a system which is<br>called uh the national student index<br>which includes every student studying in<br>New Zealand um and we our admissions<br>team has to put your name forward for<br>that and to do that we have to certify<br>officially that you are who you say you<br>are um and it's a government reg<br>regulation so we're not following our<br>own rules it's um something that the<br>government has set up for us so is it<br>the case that you can get an offer by<br>simply scanning and uploading your<br>passport cuz you want that information<br>and I think it's important so that the<br>offer letter name matches exactly with<br>the passport that's first step but it's<br>helpful if you already certify it when<br>you upload it is that right it saves us<br>a bit of time like that yes so you can<br>um you can have a complete offer without<br>having certified identity documents um<br>but that means that you aren't fully<br>enrolled yet um you can enroll once you<br>arrive on campus it's something that<br>happens during International orientation<br>week so if you aren't able to certify<br>your identity documents prior to<br>entering New Zealand you have that<br>option to do it once you get here great<br>all right do I need to apply for a<br>scholarship can I apply for more than<br>one well I can take that one because yes<br>you do need to actively apply for a<br>scholarship for 25 and onward but for<br>some of those scholarships it's as<br>simple as going click yes to the<br>question would you like to be considered<br>for an International Scholarship and<br>that's it that's all that's needed for<br>vice Chancellor scholarship the global<br>scholarship and the path a partner<br>scholarship um there is an additional<br>application for the uh High achieving<br>scholarships uh but again it's all<br>pretty straightforward can I apply for<br>more than one well by saying yes you<br>will be considered for all relevant<br>scholarships uh and then invited to<br>apply for something else as necessary in<br>terms of receiving or holding more than<br>one scholarship it is possible with the<br>high achiever plus the global or the<br>high achiever plus the vice<br>Chancellor right now we've been we're<br>running a little bit tight on time here<br>so we're going to really just summarize<br>accommodation very briefly the<br>University of atago has one of the best<br>accommodation offerings in the country<br>we have 15 residential colleges this is<br>more than just a dormatory this is an<br>experience our residential colleges are<br>are very much run by the university and<br>this is where you will find your people<br>uh it's almost it's you're sort of<br>become an Alum an alumni of of a<br>residential college but they've got<br>character and atmosphere and a proud<br>tradition in history uh and each college<br>has an amazing set of facilities so it's<br>a private bedroom usually a shared<br>bathroom facility on your floor but<br>private<br>cubicles um we do have rooms with their<br>own bathroom there we go free laundry<br>your room's clean for you once a week<br>three cooked meals a day seven days a<br>week female only floors if you need uh<br>often a a college animal pet friendly<br>animal in a stack of events and<br>tutorials we're the only University in<br>New Zealand that our residential<br>colleges have tutorials where senior<br>students or academics come in in the<br>evenings and teach the large first year<br>papers so if you're coming to a taro for<br>a bachelor applying for a residential<br>college is simply a must<br>that's just a small taste test but<br>there's plenty more to see on another<br>opportunity so um we're going to skip<br>over applying for accommodation it's a<br>little bit early for that today at the<br>second but we do want to touch on cost<br>of living because it's important to be<br>upfront and think about your costs and<br>effectively uh in New Zealand Dollars<br>you should be planning for around about<br>26 ,000 New Zealand dollars to budget<br>your uh accommodation and a residential<br>College plus your additional uh costs um<br>and of course um there are of course<br>opportunities to find private<br>accommodation separately if you wish uh<br>but we really do recommend the college<br>experience as an international student<br>uh studying in New Zealand you also have<br>uh work rights allowing you to work<br>parttime and if you're in a full degree<br>uh situation 20 hours a week and<br>fulltime in the holidays and on the<br>completion of your degree as it stands<br>you have access to up to three years<br>poststudy work rights to stay on and<br>work and get New Zealand work experience<br>too there's a lot we could say on campus<br>and student support and we just going to<br>show you imagery to give you a feeling<br>of the old and the new feeling of the<br>beautiful campus such a range of<br>students Support Services across<br>academic health and well-being uh in<br>general kind of support<br>uh huge number of clubs and

naturally I chose the<br>University of Vago one of the best<br>universities here and yeah um the one of<br>the best things about studying here at<br>the University of otago would definitely<br>be the

what have you got yeah<br>so some of the top tips that I put on<br>here to definitely be to get organized<br>time management is a key component when<br>you're studying at University cuz there<br>are times when you can fall behind on<br>lectures and tutorials so definitely<br>manage your time well and keep your<br>studies as your top priority and when<br>you first get here definitely attend as<br>many um orientation events as you can<br>those are a good way to meet new people<br>new students new international students<br>stud and make new friends basically and<br>definitely develop good study habits um<br>try and develop like a regular study<br>habit that works for you it might defer<br>for each person but try and be<br>consistent with how you study and<br>another one would be seek support early<br>um as International students sometimes<br>we struggle with our studies and that's<br>fine everyone does um the university<br>offers a lot of help so what I did last<br>year in the first year I got help um do<br>this support program called P pass where<br>it's essentially um a student from third<br>year or fourth year helping um new<br>students which um subjects they would be<br>struggling in and definitely stay active<br>and healthy go exercise go out hang out<br>with friends it's a good way to get your<br>mind off of studies and yeah just get<br>involved with all the activities that<br>otago has to offer fantastic yeah I feel<br>like uh both uh Pamela and said you<br>shared important tips uh and I always<br>think the most important is always ask<br>for help yeah people are very willing to<br>help uh at the University of atago and<br>if you want to kind of get a glimpse of<br>other parts of student life here you're<br>welcome to follow our Instagram<br>International account you might see Sid<br>or Pam and many other students uh on<br>there nothing's Photoshop and it's made<br>by the students so that's all good uh<br>and now we move into our live Q&amp;A we're<br>running a little bit late uh today but<br>that's okay we have got some questions<br>and we are going to address those as<br>best we can<br>so we are should we take the first<br>one<br>um okay is foundation year a must for<br>international students before a<br>bachelor's program uh no indeed most or<br>many International students can enter<br>directly from their uh completed upper<br>secondary high school studies straight<br>into our bachelor degree programs from a<br>large number of countries that's<br>completely fine and normal however there<br>are some countries where we don't<br>recognize the um uh the the secondary<br>school qualification as meeting as being<br>on par with the New Zealand system and<br>that would be an example where we would<br>encourage you to join our foundation<br>studies program and there are also<br>circumstances where a student might feel<br>that yep they got the university<br>entrance but would like a year to adjust<br>or just get a bit more confident being<br>taught in English if that's a new<br>opportunity for them uh and then that's<br>that can be another scenario where a<br>foundation studies program might be<br>suitable but for a large number of<br>students from many of our main markets<br>you can come straight into a bachelor<br>someone's asked is there an age limit to<br>study at<br>otaro um no there's not we don't<br>discriminate against age no however if<br>you are under the age of 18 when you<br>start at Oto there are some additional<br>um sort of support services and kind of<br>like um accommodation requirements to<br>make sure that you are uh well looked<br>after and that falls Within our New<br>Zealand Education Code of practice so we<br>have special additional things to<br>support you in those early phases got a<br>student that's actually studying in New<br>Zealand and wants to know when should<br>they or when are they able to apply for<br>any program at otago University while<br>they're studying doing their NCA in New<br>Zealand that's great and Ash can bet me<br>up on this but they could already apply<br>today yeah as of today you can apply for<br>2025 study so as soon as you want and<br>they'll be able to get get a conditional<br>offer because of course they won't have<br>their uh final NCA results until mid mid<br>January but they can get a conditional<br>offer yeah you'll get a conditional<br>offer if you submit your application and<br>then when NCA results are released in<br>next next January um we'll be able to<br>issue you with your final offer it's<br>also helpful for that particular student<br>to know that um please feel welcome to<br>go ahead and apply today but what's<br>really important is that you apply for<br>accommodation and for the New Zealand<br>University of tago entrance scholarships<br>uh in the very specific application<br>periods and that happens kick starts<br>around 1st of July to Mid August for<br>scholarships and in 1st of August to<br>mid-september for the residential<br>colleges it's vital that you apply in<br>those time Cycles as a New Zealand based<br>student as a native speaking English<br>speaker is it necessary to take an<br>English proficiency test no um if you<br>declare on your application that English<br>is your first language we will take that<br>um as proof of English language<br>proficiency so you won't need to provide<br>further results righty ho uh do we yeah<br>uh We're Just landing on the questions<br>uh now this is a good one for for for<br>Sid and Pamela to join into what are the<br>challenges faced by International<br>students and how they're asking how<br>quick do we the university attend to<br>problems so maybe you've got had some<br>experience or you know of friends who<br>have maybe had some challenges and<br>they've been able to reach out to<br>services or would you have any comment<br>on that I'm not<br>sure um for the most part the university<br>attends to like our problems pretty<br>quickly it's just um an email away<br>basically you just emailed the at askot<br>tago or or USA support and they pretty<br>much reply to you within the day or the<br>next couple of days yeah<br>yeah I think it's the same as said like<br>that's like Al University will always<br>like emphasize on our feelings because<br>we're like the international students we<br>we might need more support and did we<br>talk about how like what what kind of<br>challenge we had oh would have be<br>helpful to um I feel like one thing is<br>that I might feel a little bit excluded<br>but actually I feel that people here are<br>really friendly most of them I would say<br>so just really sa up your comfort zone<br>talk to them approach to them they were<br>always like do not has do not feel like<br>scared that your English is not good<br>enough or you have accent like we're on<br>native English speaker we will have<br>accent like they won't care about it so<br>just you know just approach to them and<br>talk to them yeah I think from a<br>university perspective it's important to<br>understand that there really is both a<br>range um and varying levels of service<br>available to you so whether that's<br>within your accommodation there is<br>academic and pastoral care support uh<br>whether it's talking to your department<br>for academic support or reaching out to<br>the student peer-to-peer support<br>services that offer tutoring like the<br>writing skills one or the math skills<br>one um or the library services or if<br>you're just frankly homesick or<br>Something's Happened back home we have a<br>specialist international student support<br>team those advisors are very well placed<br>to take confidential conversations and<br>help support you through those moments<br>as well and indeed a Visa specialist<br>Service as well so there's a variety of<br>services across no matter whether it's<br>your studies omation or day-to-day life<br>and levels uh that that can support<br>you okay so we've got one more question<br>I think which is what is the success<br>rate of applications for a bachelor's<br>program well Ash that's pretty high in<br>the main as long as you me University<br>entrance you should be able to get a<br>place here at ataro we'd like to welcome<br>you here there's just a handful of<br>Bachelor programs that have a limited<br>entry uh such as the bachelor teaching<br>well done Pamela uh The Bachelor of oral<br>health The Bachelor of dental technology<br>uh and then um there are some programs<br>later on where you have to compete for a<br>place but in the main we're very open<br>and Keen to welcome you to join us and<br>to start your tertiary education Journey<br>at the University of<br>atago okay so we have come to an end and<br>we thank you very much for sitting with<br>us for the duration or watching this as<br>a recording uh we very much welcome you<br>here to the
