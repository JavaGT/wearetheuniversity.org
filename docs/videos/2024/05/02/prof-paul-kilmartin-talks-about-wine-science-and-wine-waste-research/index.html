font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>well we're here actually at the<br>Goldwater wine Science Center uh and<br>that's been our home for the last 10<br>years we've been going as a program for<br>20 years we used to be at our Tamaki<br>campus and in that time we we teach a<br>postgraduate course and then many of<br>those students go on to do wine science<br>projects so we've worked closely with<br>the wine industry in that time on some M<br>quite major programs so nearly all of<br>our masters and PhD students are<br>partnering with the wine company they<br>can do some of that here on the gold<br>water estate uh the goldie Winery uh but<br>often they'll be going to the hawk spay<br>or malra to actually do their research<br>as well getting underway with the wine<br>waste program well it's been a busy few<br>months as we get people employed we've<br>got new PhD students to bring on new<br>research fellows to really help uh move<br>things forward plus we're gearing up for<br>the Harvest that's about to happen to be<br>able to supply a lot of great Mark to<br>our researchers throughout the country<br>gra Mark is what's left over after the<br>wine making process so for red grapes<br>you uh keep the keep the grape skins and<br>seeds on throughout the wine making and<br>often press it off at the end so all the<br>sugars have been fermented to alcohol<br>with white grapes you tend to press them<br>off before you ferment so they will<br>include further things like sugars but<br>it's really those extra skins and seeds<br>that are left over about 20% of the<br>weight of the original grapes can be<br>left over Mark yeah well here here we<br>know that there are some things that you<br>can already take from great Mark uh that<br>are well established you can get alcohol<br>from the sugars you can get tartaric<br>acid the wine acid and you can squeeze<br>the grape seeds to get uh grape seed oil<br>which you can buy on the supermarket<br>we're not touching those so we're after<br>new things which some of the unwanted<br>parts so what type of protein can you<br>get out of the great Mark what are the<br>fibrous materials that you can turn into<br>paper what are some of the uh so-called<br>polyphenols that can be used as<br>antioxidants and antimicrobial agents so<br>they're just some of of the additional<br>we would like to turn into high value<br>products so we group them into three<br>groups one is high value chemicals so<br>that might be proteins phosphorus uh and<br>and surfactants now phosphorus is an<br>interesting one because phosphorus<br>compounds we use a lot of rock phosphate<br>for our fertilizer we need to recycle<br>some of that back uh into into industry<br>and to Fine Chemicals and surfactants uh<br>taking some of the cellulose and other<br>materials and making again value added<br>chemicals another scam uses what's<br>called lignan and polyphenols and one of<br>our engineering chemists can can turn<br>lignin into into into fats into lipid<br>molecules uh other other ones my<br>particular project is to take some of<br>the uh antioxidant tannins and put them<br>into food packaging to try to lengthen<br>the shelf life of foods the final stream<br>is about paper making and that's where<br>we functionalize paper using some of the<br>residual material the other aim is to<br>get some of these products to be<br>commercialized so we'll find out which<br>ones are again the most economically and<br>environmentally viable and if we can<br>have companies that are spin out or<br>existing companies buy and use these<br>aim</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
