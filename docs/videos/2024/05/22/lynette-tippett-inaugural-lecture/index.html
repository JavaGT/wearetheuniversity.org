to<br>welcome you here I'm John hosking Dean<br>of science here at way Papa matal<br>University of Oakland it's my very great<br>pleasure not only to welcome you to the<br>university but to the inaugural lecture<br>of Professor Lynette<br>tippet what goes on inside our brains is<br>the question which we humans have<br>puzzled over since time of Memorial<br>today that question is particularly<br>pertinent as the increasing prevalence<br>of many neurological conditions ranging<br>from traumatic brain injury to neurogen<br>degenerative diseases is accompanied by<br>growing concern about the impacts on<br>individuals and their<br>final lyette is at the Forefront of<br>multidisciplinary research attempting to<br>bridge between biology and cognition<br>particularly to provide crucial insights<br>into what goes wrong when Euro<br>degenerative diseases such as Huntington<br>huntingtons and Alzheimer's occur<br>she leads a network of dementia<br>prevention research clinics that<br>illustrates both that multidisciplinary<br>research and additionally strives to com<br>combine scientific rer with manari<br>Tanga Lynette was born and raised in<br>taranaki seems like a good breeding<br>ground she studied zoology and<br>psychology here at the University of<br>Oakland developing a fascination with<br>the brain and what goes wrong with it<br>this led to an MSC and PhD and so<br>psychology and a diploma in Clinical<br>Psychology followed by posts at carnegi<br>melon and the University of<br>Pennsylvania before she was lured back<br>to Oakland Lynette has taught<br>neuropsychology for more than 30 years<br>and is supervised more than just 30 just<br>30 just 30<br>bio and she said Vis more than 80<br>graduate students identifying the<br>complex interactions between brain<br>dysfunction and changes in memory and<br>other cognitive abilities remains at the<br>heart of her work Lynette is associate<br>director of the center for brain<br>research and it's great to see some of<br>his CBR people here tonight and was<br>awarded an o nzm in 2023 for her<br>contributions to neuropsychology and<br>dementia tonight Lynette's going to talk<br>about her research and dementia<br>L OT thank you everyone for coming out<br>uh this evening uh to come and hear me<br>talk um I've done a lot of thinking<br>about the talk but I'm still not sure<br>I've got it quite right but I'll I'll<br>uh I began my life as John said in<br>tanaki and how to be precise a small<br>town in South taranaki and taranaki<br>definitely punches above its weight for<br>most things um I in our small town I was<br>the youngest in a family of three um cuz<br>I was little I was shorter than my<br>sister at that point but that<br>changed as we grew up um was a pretty<br>happy childhood with all the freedoms of<br>a small town where you could basically<br>do anything as a kid um we had a lot of<br>aunties and uncles and cousins about and<br>family was always pretty uh special for<br>us I think we were a workingclass family<br>our dad uh owned a small car painting<br>business that he worked in but it just<br>seemed to be the way it was then um and<br>uh yeah it was a happy was a happy<br>upbringing uh like most people in our uh<br>Community I went to the local high<br>school harer high school which is no<br>more actually but at the time it had<br>1100<br>students and most people went there<br>um I was lucky that my sister Gail had<br>gone to University before me she was the<br>first member of our family to attend<br>University but it kind of smoothed way<br>for me I didn't have to do any<br>arguing and and I just want to<br>acknowledge that my my family has<br>remained a very special part of my<br>life uh but at the end of school I uh<br>came up to Oakland to uh study as John<br>said biology and psychology at the end<br>of that undergraduate degree I didn't<br>really know what I wanted to do I<br>enjoyed both of them and I didn't know<br>what direction to go in so I took a very<br>sensible path and left it all behind and<br>went overseas um and traveled and uh had<br>a lot of Adventures and made uh friends<br>for life and in amongst that time I did<br>some thinking and what came to me was<br>that what had really stayed with me from<br>my undergraduate years was what I'd<br>learned about the brain and in<br>particular about what happened to people<br>when they had disorders of the brain so<br>it was like okay that's it that's what I<br>want that's the path I want to pursue um<br>it was kind of the perfect union for me<br>of biology and and uh psychology kind of<br>putting together the complex biology of<br>the brain with the complex functioning<br>of people and with people right in the<br>center of that and so it was it was uh a<br>pathway that I haven't regretted so I<br>came back to Oakland University did my<br>Master's my PhD and a training in<br>Clinical Psychology diploma in Clinical<br>Psychology what I which I think has also<br>impacted the kind of pathway that my uh<br>research career has taken and after that<br>uh I went to the states and did my post<br>dos at carnegi melon and the University<br>of Pennsylvania and that was a really uh<br>great time um once I got over a little<br>problem that I had when I first arrived<br>which was that nobody could understand<br>my<br>accent so I would go to a restaurant or<br>a bar and the drinks person would come<br>up and ask what I wanted and I might say<br>cuz it was very hot I'd like some water<br>please and there was a very high chance<br>Booker when I would introduce myself as<br>lyette most people said oh Denise nice<br>to meet<br>you but once I figured out that if I<br>wanted water I I had to ask for water<br>and I had to reply to the name Denise<br>after that uh it it all went swimmingly<br>know it was a really um it was really<br>enjoyable and extending time in my life<br>but I was fortunate then to um be able<br>to apply for a post that became<br>available back here in the school or<br>what was in the department of psychology<br>and I returned to New Zealand and that<br>began my career what did happen to be<br>almost 30 years ago almost<br>um now I'm going to do what um I was<br>instructed to definitely not do um and<br>that is to um acknowledge my partner<br>Michael and my daughter<br>Georgia uh for their support and<br>encouragement over the years and for<br>keeping me grounded and making me laugh<br>when things get a bit tough so uh some<br>of you will know Georgia from the<br>earliest Christmas parties when she was<br>just a baby in the department um but<br>she's quite a lot older<br>now<br>um no<br>thank you that was so I didn't talk for<br>too<br>long okay now I also um it wouldn't be<br>right not to acknowledge the kind of<br>academic um influences I've had from my<br>mentors and supervisors and the first<br>person who really um had a big impact on<br>me was Dr Dorothy gromo who uh lectured<br>me at undergraduate and later at at<br>Master's level and Dorothy uh spoke to<br>us about her work with mild traumatic<br>brain injury and uh the effects of a<br>concussion and how providing people with<br>appropriate re Rehabilitation could<br>really make a difference to their<br>outcome and I was really uh struck by<br>that work at the time she faced a lot<br>she and her uh collaborator neurosurgeon<br>Mr Philip britson placed they faced a<br>huge amount of skepticism because people<br>didn't really believe concussion was<br>anything more than a psychological<br>phenomena but it's now accepted that uh<br>following a mild TBI it is common for<br>people to have concussion symptoms and<br>they will usually with appropriate<br>management um<br>recover so uh Dorothy really pointed me<br>in the direction of this work um during<br>my PhD I was co-supervised by associate<br>professor Jenny Ogden and Professor Mike<br>cblas and uh for those of you who know<br>Jenny she's uh she's a very passionate<br>noisy clinical neuropsychologist<br>and she really um kind of encouraged the<br>development of that um side of me both<br>professionally and in the research world<br>she was very talented at working with<br>people with uh brain disorders and Mike<br>most of us will know Mike he was a<br>brilliant cognitive neuroscientist who<br>studied many things including visual<br>imagery and laterality and language and<br>he of course had the gift of language<br>himself um with being able to explain<br>the most complicated concept so easily<br>and his writing was equally clear and I<br>hope I learned a little bit from him in<br>that time and finally uh Professor<br>Martha Farah was my mentor in my postdoc<br>in uh the United States and Martha was<br>also is also a brilliant cognitive<br>neuropsychologist quite quirky actually<br>but she really challenged me to think<br>differently about how the brain worked<br>and how cognition worked and<br>uh in that time especially carnegi melon<br>she actually got me and for those of you<br>who know me now this will seem a little<br>unusual she actually had me doing<br>computational modeling of how the brain<br>works so technically I haven't kept up<br>with that uh but it it was a really<br>interesting time and it really shifted<br>the way I thought about uh cognition and<br>uh how cognitive functions were<br>organized in the brain and that stayed<br>with me through my teaching of clinical<br>neur psychology and uh my<br>research okay<br>so now I'd like to kind of spend the<br>evening taking you on a bit of a journey<br>through my research career it's a bit of<br>a jerky Journey not a smooth line and<br>there's not going to be as many stops as<br>I would have liked because I was told I<br>was only allowed an hour and not two so<br>um so there's a few jumps here um uh but<br>but the journey really is is about<br>research focused on that interaction<br>between the brain and how people<br>function their cognition their emotional<br>functioning uh how they function in<br>social interactions in their family and<br>how they function uh spiritually as well<br>and my work has benefited enormously<br>from being multidisciplinary from my<br>collaborations with other colleagues in<br>Psychology and also the center for brain<br>research because that's what enables<br>converging methods to be applied to a<br>question and there's just so much more<br>that can be learned when you pull those<br>different levels<br>together okay so back in New Zealand for<br>the first time I was sitting in my empty<br>office and yes I once had an empty<br>office uh and i' I'd not long been back<br>and I had a phone call from this person<br>called Richard fall who I didn't know um<br>and he said oh hello good good I've been<br>waiting for you to arrive why we need<br>your help I was like okay okay and that<br>was actually the beginning of um a long<br>Association of working in the area of<br>Huntington's disease and there were have<br>been many people I have collaborated and<br>worked with over the years in this field<br>uh but at that oh and I do want to<br>acknowledge I do want to acknowledge um<br>distinguished Professor Richard V<br>because he's had a pretty profound<br>impact on on various directions that my<br>career have taken and also because he<br>epitomizes that passion for the brain at<br>the same time as keeping people in the<br>person right in the center of the<br>piction and our responsibilities to the<br>people that we're working with with<br>brain diseases so um thank you for that<br>Richard at the time that he called me uh<br>he and his colleague uh Henry W vogo<br>were working on uh working with brains<br>that have been donated to the<br>neurological Foundation human brain Bank<br>um of people who died with Huntington's<br>disease so they were looking at the<br>brains of these people who died and what<br>they discovered was that um there were<br>changes in neurotransmitter receptor uh<br>areas or neurochemical we'll call them<br>neurochemical compartments of a a<br>structure in the brain that was known to<br>be important for honey disease Statum<br>but they were the changes were patchy<br>some people lost one neurochemical<br>compartment other people lost a<br>different one some people lost both but<br>it wasn't just to do with the severity<br>of the disease and they asked the<br>question and what they wanted us to or<br>me to help with was to look at whether<br>this patchy finding had anything to do<br>with the symptomatology that people<br>experienced during the course of the<br>disease and this was a pretty<br>far out question actually because you<br>know Huntington's caused Huntington's<br>disease is caused by an autosomal<br>dominant gene so you need one copy of<br>this Gene and if you have it you will<br>almost certainly with a few exceptions<br>develop clinical symptoms of the disease<br>so it's a it's one gene inherited uh<br>from a<br>parent uh in terms of what happens<br>clinically to people with Huntington's<br>disease is the Triad of symptoms that<br>are are associated with this Condition<br>it's most um characterized by the motor<br>disorder that develops as people develop<br>symptoms particularly an involuntary<br>motor disorder that involves kind of<br>carea irregular unpredictable movements<br>um but also there are problems with<br>cognition and thinking that develop to<br>different extents in different people<br>and for some people there is also a mood<br>or psychiatric component that is not<br>just a reaction to having the disease it<br>seems to be part of the disease process<br>for some people so there was the Triad<br>and if you looked at the literature then<br>what you would read is that it's a<br>pretty standard uh development of<br>symptoms that people experience but<br>people on the ground working with people<br>with Huntington's disease they knew all<br>along that there's a lot of variability<br>between different individuals and some<br>of that is accounted for by uh<br>characteristics of the gene but some of<br>it is not so clearly Associated uh with<br>the gene so you can have for example<br>symptoms uh you can have siblings in the<br>same family who who inherit the gene<br>from the same parent grow up and present<br>very differently at different ages uh<br>with different symptoms predominant<br>during the disease course and we have<br>written several times about a pair of<br>brothers who really epitomized this that<br>uh Virginia hog and I uh worked with<br>while they were alive and they had a<br>different they had the same identical<br>characteristics of the gene they had a<br>difference in symptom onset of 12 Years<br>one of them who developed symptoms<br>younger had really marked new<br>development of mood and psychiatric<br>symptoms a lot of cognitive problems and<br>later motor symptoms<br>the other brother he developed it when<br>he was 12 years older than that brother<br>it was a very mild course there was no<br>mood there was nothing to explain the<br>difference in these two men their<br>environments were almost identical they<br>grew up on the farm they married Like a<br>Woman They both Farm they uh there was<br>so much they had in common and even in<br>monotic Twin pears you can see variable<br>uh clinical symptoms so we have here<br>this clinical variability and Richard<br>and Henry seeing that difference in the<br>brain and the question was did they um<br>you know could they explain each other<br>or were they related now this was um<br>quite challenging for a psychologist<br>actually because I'm trained to<br>interview and assess people while<br>they're alive um and we were being asked<br>to generate these uh symptom profiles<br>from people who had already died from<br>Huntington's disease so I didn't want to<br>say to Richard that this was a problem<br>so we just said about uh we just said<br>about um we just said about doing<br>this um so we developed a methodology<br>where we could<br>reliably uh extract uh clinical history<br>of each individual we tested this on<br>people who were alive the methodology<br>and we were getting um reliable results<br>and uh we were able to estimate the age<br>of onset but importantly the patterns of<br>clinical change that each individual<br>experienced while they were alive and<br>particularly the nature and severity of<br>motor and mood symptoms we've never been<br>able to<br>retrospectively get reliable data on<br>cognition um so people are not very good<br>at being able to report cognition<br>basically um so but the motor mood<br>components were um quite clear and<br>reliable and um these are the sorts of<br>things that Richard Ana's group would<br>generate you don't have to understand<br>these but they're es through the<br>striatum and they're stained in a way<br>that shows these two compartments and um<br>so there's a compartment called The<br>Matrix in this area and it's sort of a<br>large compartment and in this uh one up<br>here on the top right um a lot of that<br>is gone and what you're left with are<br>these dark patches called the striosomes<br>and this case those stries have all gone<br>and you've got the white patches uh but<br>the Matrix is in good shape and some<br>people lose both and um we worked in a<br>double blind fashion of course and we'<br>made predictions about what which<br>compartment would be associated with<br>which symptom and what we found was that<br>the stome compartment uh that had<br>connections with uh regions of uh<br>frontal cortex and uh Li limic<br>areas uh the people who had lost or had<br>damage or poor stroke omes were the<br>people who had severe mood problems both<br>at onset of the disease and at the end<br>stages of the disease and so what we<br>were able to show was a like a<br>phenomenal it was the first<br>demonstration actually of the<br>functional inh humans of the functional<br>properties of this little uh<br>neurochemical um subsystem in the<br>brain uh We've continued that work and<br>been able to also show that um<br>Huntington's disease also affects the<br>cortex and that there's a lot of uh<br>variation in terms of where in the<br>cortex cells are lost and that this<br>again uh relates to uh the clinical uh<br>variation between people so that's been<br>a really uh rewarding uh<br>collaboration<br>um yeah um there's a lot else went on<br>I'd love to have talked about my work on<br>TBI actually um but my partner told me<br>last night no you've got to chop<br>something so um I did and uh so I'm<br>going to LEAP to this chapter which<br>actually began about 10 years ago and it<br>was um began in the cor Lounge at<br>Oakland domesa Airport there were some<br>people here who were also present that<br>day we were on a trip down to denan and<br>and it was about the it was about the<br>application to uh for a center for<br>research Excellence which was to become<br>brnz but I was kind of thinking why am I<br>on this trip I wasn't really part of<br>that development and so I was kind of<br>thinking this a bit OD I well and then<br>while we were in this CaRu Lounge<br>Richard turned to me and Alan Barber<br>who's here right now had a bit of a<br>smoke on his face actually at the time<br>um and Richard turned to me and said<br>Anette how would you like to set up a<br>dementia research<br>Clinic<br>um well what do you say what do you say<br>okay<br>um so that was 10 years ago and um this<br>is now um so we began um with the help<br>of uh some funding from the outs New<br>Zealand charitable trust and the Angus<br>trust a small group of us began<br>developing a prototype for a dementia<br>research clinic and um the the people<br>who were really Central to this are Gary<br>Chong who's here who's an older age<br>psychiatrist neurologist Dr K Brickle<br>neuropsychologist Chris Dr Christina<br>ilsa and geriatrician uh Dr Phil Wood<br>and Karen Smith was our research nurse<br>and Erin Kon our human blood uh<br>researcher and we spent a long time uh<br>looking at International protocols<br>looking at what we would need to do to<br>have a clinic that would be capable of<br>answering questions and uh we were uh<br>supported by brain research New Zealand<br>um and with support from Peter Thorne<br>and Cliff Abraham to develop these<br>clinics in Christ Church and denen as<br>well and um uh right now uh because<br>Baron z l was not refunded we are<br>supported by the New Zealand dementia<br>uh prevention trust New Zealand dementia<br>prevention trust and the Hugh green<br>foundation and we also had some funding<br>from the a brain project and that photo<br>was taken at a clinic meeting of the<br>three clinics um down a crossr last year<br>and um there are some amazing clinicians<br>and some amazing researchers who are<br>still keeping um this week going so<br>what's it all about well uh we were F we<br>have focused on primarily on um<br>Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's<br>dementia and we are definitely<br>interested in looking at uh factors that<br>might prevent or slow down the<br>development of dementia so with normal<br>aging you get get a bit of a drop off in<br>cognition uh but not too much people<br>function well um even in their later<br>years um but for a percentage of people<br>and uh who are aging their cognition uh<br>deteriorates and as well as age uh for<br>many of this these people there will be<br>an underlying accumulation of brain<br>pathology and when that drop off in<br>cognition reaches this point here this<br>is the point at which you can no longer<br>compensate for that those changes in<br>your memory and your language and your<br>phal spatial processing and it starts to<br>impact your functioning and daily life<br>and at that point it's called<br>dementia um now we've you know we're all<br>hear and we've got a bit of tsunami<br>coming in the dementia area and that's<br>not because dementia is you know kind of<br>more common and more people are catching<br>it or what whatever mechanism by which<br>people get dementia it's because there<br>are more and more people people living<br>into the older age bracket and older age<br>is the biggest risk um for dementia um<br>but what we know uh is that along this<br>sort of trajectory here we have people<br>who are reporting problems usually with<br>their memory um and we can test and see<br>that those problems are there they're<br>not performing as well as they should<br>for their age and education matched uh<br>peers and and this is a a a a condition<br>if you like that's called mild cognitive<br>impairment so it means there is<br>impairment on testing but in everyday<br>life they're functioning fine they can<br>compensate for those memory uh<br>difficulties and they're managing to<br>maintain normal functioning now if we<br>were able to uh oh and I should say that<br>not everybody who's on that line not<br>everybody with mild con impairment<br>progresses to dementia some people kind<br>of stay stable um and some people<br>actually improve and uh kind of become<br>cognitively like their PE again um so<br>it's not inevitable uh that that will<br>progress to dementia um but if we could<br>first identify those people who are<br>going to progress and second do<br>something that delays or prevents that<br>progression uh we would have a uh we<br>would make a big impact so even if we<br>delay made the development of Dementia<br>by 2 years by 2050 we will have a 20%<br>reduction on dementia prevalence if we<br>were able to delay by 5 years by 2050<br>there'll be a 50% reduction so it will<br>make a difference to the challenge to<br>our for health systems and far now uh if<br>we're able to slow it<br>down so our um clinics we would actually<br>we were the dementia research Clinic we<br>were we had to put prevention on there<br>or we wouldn't get anyone coming along<br>um so we added that um into the name and<br>um we've really are looking to identify<br>factors that affect the likelihood of<br>progression from memory problems to<br>outsider's disease and demure and we're<br>doing this in a large cohort of new<br>zealanders and we want this cohort to be<br>reflective of the New Zealand community<br>and the New Zealand makeup of our<br>community um and we're particularly<br>targeting people with mild cognitive<br>impairment but also older adults with<br>normal cognition we've also got people<br>there who we call subjective cognitive<br>decline so they are worried they think<br>they notice problems but we can't see it<br>on testing and we include people with<br>dementia and we're trying to identify a<br>patent or B arit that signature that<br>predicts progression so we're doing this<br>in a very um Rich way it could be even<br>richer probably but we're looking at a<br>whole range of functions um we also<br>really want to want to understand the<br>experiences of individuals in their far<br>now who are living with mild cognitive<br>impairment and dementia and we have a<br>lot of work going on trying to identify<br>mechanisms underlying uh the development<br>of these conditions so you will hear<br>really that we know all that we need to<br>know about Alzheimer's disease but it's<br>not actually true there are some<br>Pathways that are direct into the<br>development of AR uh Alzheimer's disease<br>but there are many mechanisms uh that<br>might lead to the you know trajectory of<br>developing the pathology and it's those<br>mechanisms and opportunities to<br>intervene that we're interested in<br>finding and we are hoping for our<br>participants who in the clinics to be<br>able to be in a position to test a range<br>of interventions when they uh become<br>available so at the moment we have um<br>assessed<br>491 uh participants we've had 410 people<br>who've enrolled in the clinics um and<br>done a full uh Baseline assessment and<br>they range as I said from um healthy or<br>or cognitively unimpaired controls and<br>through the trajectory to of mild<br>cognitive impairment to early<br>dementia the three Clinic<br>as a said are in Oakland Christ Church<br>indoned so we've got almost 300 who have<br>enrolled in Oakland um and the two South<br>Island clinics are smaller but you know<br>but they bring um more variation more<br>variety and uh uh more involvement for<br>the whole country um so far uh we've had<br>around we've had 2 uh 55 I think people<br>complete their second year followup and<br>we've got uh close to<br>10050 at the 4year followup and about 60<br>who've done a six-year followup and<br>we've got a handful of people who've<br>been with us uh for eight years and our<br>um we have about an 84% retention rate<br>of participants and that's pretty good<br>because these people are older they're<br>55 years plus but there's quite a few<br>who are older and they develop a lot of<br>other health conditions or their<br>families develop health conditions and<br>because what we're asking them to do is<br>quite a lot we're very pleased that we<br>have got the commitment from such a<br>large uh number of<br>people so when each participant comes to<br>our clinic and they come every two years<br>on average they go through a really<br>thorough assessment they have clinical<br>medical uh lifestyle neuropsychological<br>some mood uh uh assessments they undergo<br>uh a very detailed MRI scan that<br>includes research and clinical scans and<br>most of them have an amalo pet scan<br>which enables us to see whether they<br>have any of the amalo plaques that are<br>one of the uh characteristics of<br>Alzheimer's disease um and we also uh<br>are fortunate to be uh given take uh<br>blood from our participants they<br>generously generously allow us to take<br>quite a lot of blood and uh our blood<br>team<br>um collect the blood in five different<br>tubes and from that they derive a lot of<br>different uh blood products which are<br>then um stored in very small ampules and<br>at in the cry store atus 190° so that<br>that's uh storage and handling of uh our<br>Bloods which will enable the testing for<br>blood biomarkers uh for years to come<br>now there are two things uh oh so they<br>and they do this every two years so<br>there are there are two things that leap<br>out to me from this um one is that we<br>have a huge amount of data like a huge<br>amount of very rich data uh what most of<br>which is now captured in um a red cap<br>database um our scans are elsewhere<br>obviously in our Bloods are elsewhere<br>but there are links to those in this<br>database uh and it's managed by Leon gr<br>grer very effectively um but the other<br>thing that strikes me and might strike<br>you as well is that the participants in<br>our Clinic are doing a huge amount for<br>us um it's you<br>know three visits sometimes four to<br>complete each assessment the assessments<br>are delivered with skill and kindness<br>but they are quite demanding um on our<br>people they're older and as we do have<br>people progressing to diens<br>it is a lot that we are asking for and<br>getting uh from people and that's um why<br>I wanted to talk a little bit about<br>combining science with uh manari Tanga<br>uh because uh the care of um or the<br>responsibility we have for our<br>participants is is um is enormous um<br>we've always placed a high value on<br>excellent clinical assessment and we<br>have the highest caliber clinicians<br>working in our Clinic we give very<br>detailed feedback to our participants we<br>provide them with lots of information we<br>have annual events um so we've always<br>felt like we have we have looked after<br>our participants but at this point I<br>want to acknowledge um Dr<br>vorort um Vora is an esteemed uh career<br>and uh doctor and yora has very gently<br>and very patiently walked beside me for<br>many years in my research both in<br>Huntington's disease and with these<br>clinics and she's just quietly in her<br>quiet way been kind of encouraging me<br>and and guiding me and sort of trying to<br>support me<br>in and realizing maybe and the need<br>about bringing monar Tanga as a<br>researcher to Mai and to non-mi members<br>of our research community and she<br>additionally walks beside all of our Mar<br>participants who uh come to the clinic<br>so I I want to acknowledge the guidance<br>and and the kind of years of unpaid<br>input that why Vora has given and I also<br>want to acknowledge Dr Macarena Dudley<br>who um many of you will know has been<br>leading a group of my researchers in uh<br>the development of a theory of dementia<br>M worry from uh from within the Mali<br>world and also in developing a<br>assessment tool for dementia that is<br>valid and appropriate for Mai now I'm<br>not Mai so I wasn't part of the research<br>group but I was lucky to be a part of<br>The Advisory Group and what that meant<br>for me actually what it meant was I<br>often had to shut up I often had to sit<br>in the room and shut up because I wasn't<br>the research leader but it gave me like<br>incredible opportunity to listen and<br>experience and absorb how these<br>researchers were working with kamat<br>katoa all over the country and how they<br>were showing um care and generosity and<br>uh reciprocity with their participants<br>um it showed me that there's more than<br>one model of dementia um and that for m<br>uh it's w that actually changes first um<br>and it also showed me in terms of the<br>cognitive tool because I work closely<br>closely with makarena on developing the<br>uh cognitive assessment Tool uh for this<br>and it showed me in the kind of<br>iterative feedback we had from our<br>participants just how important it was<br>when you are assessing someone's<br>cognition that they can see their world<br>and those materials now now I thought I<br>knew that I actually thought I knew that<br>but there was something about seeing and<br>hearing the words of those people that<br>just really um hit home and it also has<br>made me reflect on our clinic and as our<br>um participants have um stayed with us<br>for a long time we've all become a<br>little bit aware of the need for us to<br>do more for them uh we have to maintain<br>the Integrity of the science but there<br>is many opportunities to do more for<br>them and our clinical team I do want to<br>take my hats out off to them for their<br>Endeavors in this regard we have<br>students who some of whom are working on<br>Clinic projects some of whom are not who<br>really work with uh people when they<br>come in for an MRI people come in<br>they're pretty anxious actually it's<br>quite a big deal having an MRI and going<br>into the machine for 45 minutes and<br>having that coil and they are do a great<br>job with those so um you know our um our<br>attempts for uh taking responsibility<br>and reciprocity we are attempting to<br>improve in that way and that and I'm<br>going to show something which puts me at<br>risk of never being spoken to again um<br>because I want to acknowledge our Clinic<br>manager and research nurse Jane goer who<br>leads this drive towards uh caring for<br>and being responsible for our<br>participants she's a role model for<br>everyone and she brings her own cultural<br>values that align actually with M<br>cultural values um to the running of the<br>clinic so I think it's I don't know it's<br>been a real it has been a realization<br>for me and and in the kind of work that<br>we're doing I think it's uh really<br>important um oh but I just want to make<br>it clear that we're not perfect actually<br>and uh last year we set up a participant<br>engagement group and Gary Chong has been<br>running this as um uh for us or he's<br>part of our team and we we've had really<br>good buying from our participants<br>actually to this and they are not shy of<br>telling us what we're doing well and<br>what we are not doing well and some<br>things we thought we were doing really<br>well they were saying why aren't you<br>doing this and we were like we are but<br>obviously we weren't in a way that was<br>accessible to them so it's been a uh<br>it's an interesting journey and I guess<br>it's part of that listening and taking<br>back and listening and taking back so um<br>yeah it's it's a whole another dimension<br>to the project um but um what about uh<br>some of the research that uh we're doing<br>but there we've now reached a sort of<br>level of numbers that we can start<br>really looking at some interesting<br>questions um and I'm just going to give<br>you three brief examples of projects uh<br>that are going on before because I do<br>want to get to the sense of self because<br>it was in the title um and John<br>Montgomery wants to hear about it um so<br>um in 2020 there was a paper published<br>on modifiable risk factors for dementia<br>and there are 12 identified risk factors<br>that account for 40% of the prevalence<br>of dementia uh and these are indeed all<br>modifiable and if we were able to remove<br>them all we would reduce demential<br>prevalence by 40% and this was pretty<br>you know<br>outstanding new information because<br>there had been a feeling that we<br>couldn't do anything if we couldn't do<br>something biological we couldn't do<br>anything now uh you the risk factors<br>there that are in red um are in red<br>because they all uh align actually with<br>risk risks for heart disease they're all<br>cardiovascular risk factors but they are<br>also uh risk factors for the vascular<br>system in the brain for the blood<br>vessels in the brain the the vessels<br>that uh deliver blood which delivers<br>glucose and oxygen to our brain<br>measure and uh we know that basically<br>what's good for the heart is good for<br>the brain uh but the questions we are<br>looking at is how exactly does the<br>cerebrovascular risk increase risk for<br>dementia and in particular is it related<br>to Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's<br>dementia because there is a small amount<br>of evidence suggesting that it may<br>exacerbate the Cascades of pathology uh<br>deposition of amalo and Tow so um<br>Alzheimer's disease pathology is<br>characterized predominantly by these<br>clumps of proteins amalo plaques and<br>tail Tangles um there is neurod<br>degeneration or loss of neurons but<br>there is a question about whether<br>vascular factors may be a fourth factor<br>that contribute to the Cascade that<br>happens um so we're doing a number of<br>projects in this area and the MRI work<br>is led by Katherine Morgan who is the um<br>one of the leads on our neuroimaging<br>platform and we're looking at a number<br>of different mechanisms if you like by<br>which uh vascular Health might impact<br>Dementia in in particular<br>the development of Alzheimer's<br>disease but um I'm just going to talk<br>about uh one of these um briefly to give<br>you an example of the work going on so<br>the second one here is uh related to<br>disease of the small blood vessels and<br>to the accumulation of something called<br>white matter<br>hyperintensities so in this uh scan here<br>on the right you can see this sort of<br>white Kind of Blue<br>patches that are developing and these<br>are not holes in the brain these are<br>kind of areas of of lower density in the<br>white matter they happen uh increasingly<br>with age and they can be present in<br>cognitively normal people so they don't<br>inevitably cause uh cognitive problems<br>um but uh what we are interested in um<br>is whether these hyperintensities are<br>sort of midway between healthy tissue<br>and tissue death whether they are in any<br>way promoting the Cascade um of<br>Alzheimer's<br>disease I think the vascular before I<br>forget to say it um the<br>vascular elements of dementia are also<br>important for the New Zealand population<br>because they uh Mali and Pacifica people<br>have been shown to develop dementia<br>earlier uh than uh pakha and Asian<br>communities and they also over<br>represented in all these uh in these<br>cardiovascular risk factors so if we're<br>able to uh sort out uh the mechanisms by<br>which these uh risks are occurring and<br>uh work towards um uh treatments for<br>those we may make a real difference to<br>the New Zealand population um this<br>example I'm going to give you of work<br>going on is the work of our PhD student<br>uh Cameron hymon and he is looking uh at<br>whether the volume of white metah hypens<br>tense is related to clinical and<br>cognitive impairment in our sample and<br>uh his preliminary findings show that if<br>you look across the clinical groups that<br>we have from uh healthy control across<br>to increasingly impaired to early<br>dementia uh we have as expected a volume<br>in the control group this is a log scale<br>but there's a linear uh uh significant<br>linear Trend showing in in increasing um<br>levels of white matter hyperintensities<br>in those groups now that doesn't tell us<br>uh whether that's causing the cognitive<br>impairment or how that's interacting um<br>but the next step of his work is trying<br>to see whether the location of these is<br>associated with specific cognitive<br>problems so that will tell us if they're<br>making a difference or not in our sample<br>so uh we're doing this um by uh using<br>software we collaborating with uh Flavia<br>dequa from Kings College London he has a<br>imaging software that enables us to<br>determine the load for each white matter<br>track in the brain of white matter<br>hyperintensities and then we'll be able<br>to examine whether that the extent of<br>the load is related to the cognitive<br>problems that are associated with that<br>cognitive functions that are associated<br>uh we are also looking at uh a range of<br>uh structural MRI brain measures and uh<br>cognition and looking to see whether<br>looking at that integration can help<br>identify those at highest risk in those<br>earlier groups of developing Alzheimer's<br>disease so I'm just going to show you a<br>little bit of Tess chaffy work Tess has<br>her doctoral oral at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow<br>morning so she's not here tonight um<br>this work is co-supervised with um Dr R<br>Roberts and uh Ian Kirk and Katherine<br>involved in the structural work as well<br>um but basically the uh early what we're<br>seeing at the early stages is when we<br>look at um our people at Baseline and<br>then look at the people who have<br>converted to uh Alzheimer's probable<br>Alzheimer's dementia at uh year two<br>years later and we uh then look at that<br>the people who haven't converted were<br>able to uh use uh techniques that enable<br>us to tell what uh in this case<br>cognitive measures are the ones that are<br>reliably contributing to conversion so<br>which measures at Bas line are the ones<br>that reliably tell us who is going to uh<br>progress uh to dementia two years later<br>and uh what we found is um two memory<br>tests not surprising in one way a verbal<br>memory test and a visual memory test are<br>the things that load most highly on<br>predicting and also a measure of<br>executive function category switching<br>now what this might enable us to do is<br>to have much more refined and targeted<br>cognitive batteries that will then be<br>you know easier for clinicians uh to<br>administer because it'll take less time<br>and that we can have some confidence in<br>the accuracy of them picking up those<br>people at highest risk um when we look<br>at the um brain regions showing the<br>greatest difference uh at Baseline for<br>those who converted versus those who<br>remain stable um we find a range of<br>areas that include uh the regions<br>involved in memory the hip campal<br>regions temporal regions but also the uh<br>anterior singulate uh region of the<br>brain which is likely to be particularly<br>involved in the switch category switch<br>task that we have found<br>cognitively I've got to<br>hurry um I just want to have one quick<br>shout out to our blood biomarker work um<br>this is work being led by eron coron and<br>what's happened in the course of our<br>Clinic is that has it has become<br>possible to measure really tiny amounts<br>of protein in the blood that have come<br>from the brain so this is a a new thing<br>really the ability to detect brain<br>derived proteins in in the blood it's<br>not easy actually it requires highly<br>specialized uh equipment um Erin has<br>developed a collaboration with uh Dr<br>Hinrich Zetterberg who is a world um<br>leader in<br>investigating uh proteins that can be<br>measured in the plasma of Blood using<br>some other technology and um you you<br>probably a number of you will have seen<br>earlier this year there was like a big<br>noise about the fact that there's now<br>there's a blood test that might<br>revolutionize diagnosis of Alzheimer's<br>disease and what this related to with<br>findings that or using this technology<br>of detecting um Amid and towel in the<br>blood uh using some our technology<br>um and and one particular one the<br>phosphorated to 217 was shown to<br>differentiate ad from other conditions<br>at a very high rate and it was<br>measurable in mild cognitive impairment<br>as well but this is it was a big study<br>but still we need to know whether this<br>holds in the New Zealand population we<br>need to know uh what happens we need to<br>be able to track people over time to see<br>whether the presence of that protein<br>truly results in the uh progression to<br>Alzheimer's disease and Erin has started<br>the work on looking at the relationship<br>between this uh Tower protein uh and our<br>participants with their pet amalo scans<br>and in this preliminary data um we've<br>been able to show that the people who<br>were amalo uh positive uh for pet were<br>also showing uh the highest<br>um volumes or amounts uh of the PTW 217<br>whereas those who were negative were<br>showing very low numbers but there is<br>this intermediate range uh that is yet<br>to be sorted out now this is um a very<br>small amount of data and we're<br>continuing with that work um and we will<br>be able to look at our blood samples<br>over time to look at the trajectory of<br>these proteins now there are there's a<br>move<br>internationally um to diagnose outs of<br>disease just by the presence of a<br>protein and the United States is a real<br>push in that direction but I hope and<br>I'll be arguing against that becoming<br>practice in New Zealand because if you<br>tell someone who's cognitively healthy<br>and<br>normal uh who decides oh I want to find<br>out if I've got that protein that<br>they've got that protein you take away<br>all hope from them and uh in my uh<br>humble opinion uh Alzheimer's disease<br>and dementia is only present when the<br>condition is actually causing impairment<br>and functioning and we know there are<br>people with positive amalo scans who<br>live their lives with never developing<br>cognitive problems um so this is really<br>exciting work but I work with a high<br>degree of<br>responsibility and finally<br>dementia this is uh work that I've have<br>been uh conducting with um Professor<br>Donna Addis Donna was one of my master<br>students um some years ago and is now a<br>professor at um rman Institute and<br>University of Toronto and a lot of our<br>students have worked I don't know what<br>happened to that that was perfect when I<br>left home a lot of our students have<br>worked on this uh project with us so um<br>sense of self and<br>dementia one of the biggest fears<br>associated with having dementia is that<br>the person will lose their sense of self<br>lose their identity it's a fear that the<br>person has it's a fear that the family<br>member has um and it's a common<br>portrayal of Alzheimer's disease that is<br>a gradual um loss of self and there's<br>some research that shows family members<br>and caregivers will say things like<br>they're not the person they once were<br>they're a shell of their former self and<br>that sort of led to this feeling or<br>belief that there is a loss of self in<br>Alzheimer's disease now Alzheimer's<br>disease is a long journey I I'd like to<br>add people uh will be diagnosed in mild<br>symptoms they will live for many years<br>uh with dementia um and<br>uh things change but uh the fear that<br>this is something like really prevalent<br>and uh a part of the disease all the way<br>through is very strong but there is an<br>alternative view that actually the sense<br>of self<br>the essential sense of self and dementia<br>uh remains uh there was a wonderful uh<br>like video documentary that a woman in<br>the states uh put together and she had<br>videograph or videoed her mother on her<br>journey in dementia and had it was put<br>together like and it was very watchable<br>um and one of the things that um she<br>commented on was this that Revelation to<br>me is that my mother projects a very<br>strong sense of self with no memory<br>she's absolutely a full person without<br>it so her mother had lost her knowledge<br>she didn't know her daughter was her<br>daughter um she uh was living in care<br>but uh her sense was that she projected<br>this very strong sense of self and she<br>had made this comment of um her she had<br>her mother saying this that I did have a<br>warm feeling and that's simply H me<br>today just now and I'm happy it's here<br>and I'm not sure I remember where<br>everyone lives but there's something<br>close that's still with me and I'm<br>grateful for it so there there is a coun<br>of view that maybe self persists now<br>what do we mean actually by sense of<br>self that's a big question um most<br>commonly think when uh when you're<br>talking about sense of self that you're<br>talking about your identity and your<br>identity is um your self- knowledge your<br>knowledge about you know your attributes<br>your trads your preferences your beliefs<br>and values your social identities your<br>roles so for me um I might have for<br>example um some features like<br>that um but and the second<br>part a second a second part of my uh of<br>your identity will be made up by your<br>narratives about your life your ability<br>to kind of weave together a story that<br>uh encapsulates your life and and tells<br>you uh who you<br>are but it's not just that because um<br>now this this is difficult because it's<br>hard to study but uh there is also<br>another that's if you like the content<br>of yourself but there's another sense of<br>self which is your conscious experience<br>of being you of the person looking out<br>um Through Your Eyes what it's like to<br>be behind your eyes some people call it<br>your essence uh William James called it<br>the the Eye s and uh so there is there's<br>it's a more complex uh process than a a<br>single thing um and uh people talk about<br>self-continuity being the sense that<br>yourself is the same over time so um you<br>are in your essence the same person that<br>you were 10 20 30 years ago<br>um now one of the big questions is how<br>important are our memories to retaining<br>this sense of self-continuity like can<br>you know that you're still the same<br>person if you can't remember memories<br>from your past like if you've lost your<br>memory of episodes that occur in your<br>life so I know on me definitely because<br>I can remember I can not only remember I<br>can<br>re-experience the occasion when I stayed<br>with an American family for Thanksgiving<br>and in a moment that is too de hard to<br>explain but in a moment of I don't know<br>what I managed to turn on the self-clean<br>function of their new oven while all the<br>Thanksgiving dinner was<br>inside and the temperature goes up to I<br>don't know 500° th000 I don't know but<br>you can't open that door until it closes<br>down again and that was the formal lunch<br>inside this very large oven and I can<br>still re-experience how I<br>felt and I can re experience hearing my<br>friend's sister on the phone going you<br>will never guess what Happ and I can<br>re-experience waking up in the morning<br>cuz my stayed over night just that<br>filtering through the feeling that<br>something wasn't quite right and then<br>remember it so I know that's me cuz I<br>can feel that memory I know what that<br>feels like but do you know it's you if<br>you can't have access to uh memories<br>perhaps less F than that of uh your past<br>can you still feel like you're the same<br>person um well uh we have developed a<br>framework based on the existing<br>literature and that continuity has<br>always been thought to rely on<br>remembering your past events or<br>remembering your narratives of your life<br>and that has been the The View that's<br>been held strong ly but what happens<br>when you ask people with dementia about<br>their<br>self-continuity what happens when you<br>say Do you believe you're the same<br>person as you were in the early in your<br>early 20s what do they say and in um uh<br>an initial study that uh we did with<br>AMCI and ad uh dementia we found that<br>about 50% of the people said yes roughly<br>the same if not slightly more than our<br>but the same essentially as our control<br>participants so they say yes I do feel<br>like I'm the same person and if you ask<br>well how do you believe you've changed<br>and how do you believe you've remained<br>the same and then you look at the kind<br>of responses that they give what you<br>find that differs between the ad uh<br>participants and the uh controls is that<br>they their responses all reflect this ey<br>s this core essential sense of just<br>being you behind the eyes um they're<br>aware that they have you know their<br>attributes have changed what they can do<br>has changed the roles they have they're<br>aware that they change but they're very<br>clear that that essential essence of<br>their self has not changed and they're<br>not terribly articulate about it they'll<br>say well yes I don't know why but I just<br>feel like I'm the same they're very sure<br>that they feel the same on the<br>inside um I've looked at this uh in<br>collaboration with uh UK group who had a<br>cohort of nearly 1500 people with mild<br>to moderate dementia and when we look at<br>their response to the a yes no question<br>I feel I'm the same person I've always<br>been 79% of them say yes I do so despite<br>having dementia they say I feel on the<br>inside like I am the same person and the<br>21% who didn't actually were people who<br>were struggling with psychological<br>well-being and uh lower ratings on<br>living will they didn't differ in their<br>disease severity it wasn't about<br>characteristics of their disease um but<br>uh the Striking thing to me is that<br>about 80% are very sure uh that they<br>still feel the same so this is making us<br>think that actually like we might use<br>autobiographical memories to know that<br>we are who we are but you don't actually<br>need them that the to know that you are<br>the same person and it means there must<br>be other mechanisms um that are<br>functioning to give you that feedback<br>that you are the same person and odyssey<br>Davis PhD student in the lab is looking<br>at those other mechanisms right now but<br>we know that retaining sense of<br>continuity is good for psychological<br>well-being so um I think there's real<br>scope for interventions to assist with<br>that sense of the person uh remaining<br>themselves not too bad 57 now I I do<br>want to thank and acknowledge my um my<br>collaborators my colleagues my teaching<br>colleagues Suzanne Ian Paul reys um my<br>sounding boards in the department uh my<br>clinical colleagues my friends my heads<br>of schools for sort of enabling and<br>they've had to enable me actually in the<br>last 10 years um to be on this journey<br>and to all our professional staff for<br>everything they do which for me is<br>getting me out of sticky badges most of<br>the time um and also my students who you<br>know really drive the research that we<br>do and um I'm sorry I couldn't talk<br>about each and every one of you and and<br>the work that you do but um they really<br>make uh our academic careers uh come to<br>life so I'm very grateful for them thank<br>you<br>I<br>spe so um I just want to say a few words<br>on behalf of all the brain researchers<br>and now Center for brain research across<br>University of Oakland and in fact across<br>all of<br>it because in her humble way in which<br>she collaborates she pulls teams<br>together in the most incredible<br>way and you saw that in every aspect of<br>her work you know she puts everyone<br>first<br>and she's the most wonderful person and<br>the only person who could have developed<br>these Dimension fure research Cs and you<br>know when I first I've known you for<br>almost 30 years<br>almost so she taught me in our research<br>team that just looking at the brain was<br>not enough you had to go to the<br>community you had to go to the people<br>and then we could<br>realize why we were seeing what we were<br>seeing and that set a foundation that<br>you know linking with other researchers<br>lyette and I have collaborated ever<br>since you've come<br>back and taking me on Journeys taking<br>out all our research from the central<br>bra but she's a she's one of our<br>rocks and in fact by showing the<br>importance of collaborative<br>neuroscientists working together with<br>clinicians with a community with thano<br>with<br>e has influenced our whole research and<br>has set us up that was actually the<br>foundation for our Center for brain<br>research that was his foundation for<br>getting our core forming the clinics and<br>she's the most humble wonderful person<br>I've<br>known and um thank you thank you so much<br>and we got a special time to give it to<br>it<br>it you may you may wish to explain a<br>little bit about why you<br>chose well<br>um okay so um yeah so there was huge<br>variety of um of different Tonga that um<br>that we looked at and um I had an idea<br>before we went down what we might choose<br>but of course we ended up uh getting<br>something quite different so this<br>particular Tonga um means the meaning<br>behind it is the uh the circle or the<br>cycle of life and I was thinking to<br>myself well L you can think of all the<br>students that have gone through<br>your supervision and graduated and<br>you've got a whole another Bunch coming<br>through so it's<br>like but this this does represent
