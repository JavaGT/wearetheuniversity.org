to us<br>today thank you Chancellor geez there<br>graduation Modi and warm Bas<br>greetings um I'm not going to lie I do<br>quite a bit of public speaking but today<br>especially I feel very nervous um and so<br>everyone could just take a deep breath<br>with<br>me we'll be good we'll be good uh in my<br>preparations I asked uh my two border<br>directors my two boys ages 12 and 9 I<br>said give me some tips mom needs some<br>tips she wants to get up there and she<br>doesn't want to be boring and they both<br>turned around and said you know what Mom<br>it's not about what you say it's CU When<br>you tell your story you tend to cry and<br>your nose gets real snotty um so just to<br>set the toad if that does happen just<br>close your eyes I'll give it a wife and<br>we'll carry on to our graduat thank you<br>so much for embarking on this awesome<br>Journey um I'm really not here to tell<br>you what to do you know go and do all<br>these things like I did honestly<br>don't um if anything I'm here to just<br>say how much how excited I am to know<br>that we're going to have future you know<br>young leaders and people like yourself<br>who came came to the best university in<br>my opinion I love it that much I'm doing<br>my third degree um and you know you're<br>going to be out there in the workforce<br>and I just look forward to the<br>innovative ideas you know and you just<br>bring your authentic self into the<br>space and to your family members Can't<br>Forget You lot um to your family friends<br>Villages and communities well done give<br>yourself a pet on the back um it goes to<br>show that you're uh you being here today<br>and no doubt whatever Journey you went<br>alongside with your loved one here who's<br>graduating does not go unnoticed and um<br>it definitely sets a presidence for the<br>kind of support that it takes to ensure<br>that we get more of us graduating at<br>University and so thank you very<br>much um look coming to University ofo<br>was was never dream of mine I um didn't<br>do very well in high school despite<br>being a on a sports scholarship at a<br>private school in Christ Church I I left<br>year 13 with just only NCA level one um<br>but all good I was good at sport right<br>so uh that's got to come with something<br>and so the thought of coming to un was<br>so far reach from even being a part of<br>my plans um but I don't think it was<br>because of you know the work that I do<br>in the community the really meaningful<br>work that I love uh that inspired me to<br>come and to a degree here in<br>2018 I honestly believe it was my lived<br>experience of of growing up with my<br>beautiful mother um who was a single mom<br>is um and the role that I play in a Tong<br>and family like many of you we walk<br>multiple worlds for me there's these two<br>notable worlds one the Western world<br>society culture and influences and the<br>other the expectations of my Tong and<br>culture and the role that I play as an<br>only daughter in our<br>family and so you know as the only<br>daughter in the tongen family um my role<br>was from the age of like five I'm pretty<br>sure was the family translator now if<br>you come from a migrant home you if you<br>know you know um and so my role at the<br>age of five was to go along with Mom to<br>all her appointments uh for the purpose<br>of bridging language barri<br>gaps and so I would go along to doctor's<br>appointments um you know if we were to<br>turn up to any government or public<br>service agencies and my job was to try<br>and find uh English words that would<br>translate and show enough weight to<br>tongue and words so that she understood<br>what was going on and to some of you<br>you're probably like that's trauma and<br>it was<br>trauma but look at us<br>now um it was a little bit trtic I'm not<br>going to lie as reflect um but that was<br>our situation that was my current<br>situation and as much as um I don't want<br>to make it look like my mom was a bad<br>parent not at all uh if I didn't do<br>those things I don't think we would have<br>been able to to navigate some of the<br>western systems that we currently live<br>in or we did in before it's actually<br>still the same now<br>um but if there's anything I want to<br>encourage to our<br>graduates is to uh my bio SED pretty<br>cool but it's definitely definitely not<br>a flex there's nothing more I can<br>encourage but to make sure that you look<br>after<br>yourselves uh you know it's great that<br>you've gotten to this point now um but<br>it's even better because you're kind of<br>on your own unless you stay here and do<br>some more study good on you but if you<br>are stepping out into that you know big<br>world please make sure you look after<br>yourself if that looks like building a<br>support system creating a messenger chat<br>with all your friends where you don't<br>want anybody to read that chat if it's<br>about uh you know start doing the things<br>that you loved before now that you might<br>have a bit more time but definitely be<br>kind to yourself and make sure you you<br>know you set yourself up well before you<br>uh go out there and make the difference<br>that you hope to make um that's one<br>thing I reflect on my journey is that<br>you know it's all good that you want to<br>do all these good things and they do<br>bring impact but at the same time<br>there's something that has to give and<br>so for me the big give was as I would be<br>very tired and burnt out I would find<br>myself crying a lot um and the people<br>that I loved had to suffer a lot and so<br>I I definitely have no regrets I don't<br>live with regrets I take them as lessons<br>and I make sure that I share those<br>lessons with others so you don't learn<br>the hard way um I actually had a big<br>speech here that I wanted to talk about<br>but um once you're in this moment and<br>you get to see everybody uh the emotions<br>of of knowing what Journey what that<br>Journey feels like I kind of just wanted<br>to give you guys some Hypes and uh just<br>tell you not to be scared and I have<br>these five cool little not little<br>actually but five tips here that I think<br>um might help you along along the way um<br>if they don't help you just please stay<br>awake till the end we're nearly we're<br>nearly finished first one<br>is you are never too young or an<br>experience to create change I can't tell<br>you how many people told me that um I<br>needed to go and and do a bit more<br>before I could try and make change or<br>you know you haven't actually finished<br>studying um you don't actually have to<br>wait to be an expert or have all the<br>skills all you need is legit a willpower<br>and the right intentions to listen and<br>Lead through<br>passion second shoot your shot don't be<br>afraid of rejection apply organization<br>initiatives that you see yourself in and<br>a big one is networking networking<br>always helps and I know for a lot of<br>people it's a it's a hard thing to go<br>out there and have to meet others for me<br>obviously you can tell I love to chat<br>and so I find that quite easy um but<br>that's where you call upon your<br>extrovert friends to help you out in<br>these spaces you know uh come along with<br>you start some good chat that's how you<br>sort of try and navigate those faes when<br>it comes to networking or tell people<br>like myself to shut up you know and let<br>you have a turn to<br>speak thirdly there's not one type of<br>leader that you need to<br>be um you know you will often feel like<br>you're not cut out to be a leader and if<br>you don't want to be a leader that's all<br>good you know leader the word leader is<br>so fluid you know you can lead at home<br>with the dishes in the vacuum or you can<br>go out and lead in your local sports<br>club or you could lead in your own<br>personal life and so don't even feel<br>pressured to be a certain type of leader<br>um and I have to say it's often the S<br>silent ones behind the scenes who really<br>make the difference so if you don't feel<br>at all that you're because you're not a<br>loud person that you're not making a<br>difference you actually are and for<br>people like myself who are loud um and<br>who seem to get all the glory because<br>you're loud um you know we are grateful<br>for those of you who create space for<br>others and um yeah I really want to get<br>that one across fourth one play to your<br>strengths and use your<br>talents um a big thing to remember is<br>working towards transformational and<br>societal change can be in any space and<br>field you pursue I don't think you have<br>to be uh in community space or in the<br>public sector space to be able to make<br>change um I think it can happen<br>everywhere and any small amount of<br>action with good intention is good<br>this tissue needs to go in the bin but<br>um last one which is a big one in my<br>tongue and culture which is maintain<br>relationships we call that<br>daiva I've found the most impactful work<br>come from Shong and organic<br>relationships um it's the bringing<br>people together aspect that brings about<br>powerful outcomes and part of those<br>organic relationships is also working<br>along alongside people who don't align<br>with your values I think um the hardest<br>thing I've learned in this in the space<br>of advocacy in the space of working with<br>young people um in the different ideas<br>and energies that everybody brings is<br>that you're obviously going to come<br>across people who don't agree with what<br>you do or what you say and I think it's<br>a it's something that we shouldn't try<br>away from if there is any way that you<br>can sit in talor have a cord all try to<br>come to some sort of space of<br>understanding um I think there's too<br>much quy hering around the world happen<br>happening around the world uh to to not<br>find a way for us to be able to have<br>discussions and so this takes a lot of<br>growth for me because I us to be<br>quite you know really ruthless about<br>that and I would straight out cut out<br>any ideas that were different to mine I<br>would find ways to argue back um without<br>really doing what I encourage people to<br>do which is listen I don't necessarily<br>have to agree but I think it's important<br>to build a foundation with you can have<br>those important and courageous discuss<br>discussions and you're going to be<br>uncomfortable and sometimes courageously<br>uncomfortable in those situations but I<br>do ask you to lean into them um and uh<br>yeah uh as time is ticking and uh I<br>really know that it's important for you<br>to go back and celebrate with your loved<br>ones I just want to um give a a shout<br>out to the University of atago um and<br>especially a lot of people on the stage<br>I know we've all had a different<br>experience at the uni uh but for mine it<br>was definitely<br>lifechanging and it might be a<br>privileged thing to say because I'm now<br>graduated with two degrees um but just<br>the end I came to the University of Vago<br>with two kids under<br>five worst mental health they could be<br>and um it sounds a bit well why did you<br>do all those things but when the um um<br>the work and the purpose is bigger than<br>yourself as I said it can come very easy<br>to to be sidetracked when it's about<br>looking after you and so when I came to<br>Taro University<br>um there were a lot of times where I<br>felt like I wasn't sure if I wanted to<br>even wake up the next day and so it was<br>my safe space to be and times where I<br>wouldn't turn up to<br>class the one leure that Hardy would<br>talk to me he won on the stage now and I<br>I don't want to name him um would be the<br>one to email me and say Melissa um where<br>have you been you know you need to come<br>to class um and you know it was like<br>little little actions like that that<br>made me realize that there were people<br>out there who<br>cared and so on behalf of my family and<br>uh my kids um thank you for helping me<br>be a bit vision of myself I think I can<br>now lead uh with more knowledge and<br>appreciation for for what I have and so<br>with the new branding and the work that<br>has been done with Manoa thank you I I<br>encourage you to be to be brave going<br>forward and it's going to be tough uh<br>but we see the representation that it<br>brings for the future and so i' it's not<br>about me today but I just
