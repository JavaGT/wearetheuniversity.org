you<br>will have heard me say that promotion to<br>professor at a Targo is not easily<br>achieved it requires an academic to show<br>excellence and leadership in teaching<br>research and service and Tanya as we<br>will hear has demonstrated all of these<br>as you shortly here Tanya's research<br>expertise lies in the area of sport<br>pedagogy and the interconnections<br>between the coach and the athlete and as<br>any good academic should she's not been<br>afraid to challenge existing<br>orthodoxies Tanya has taught across a<br>range of papers in the school and<br>undertaken a significant role in<br>designing and implementing new<br>papers as well as being an excellent<br>researcher and teacher she's applied her<br>expertise to real World situations<br>providing guidance to many codes

formal<br>welcome and introduction to Professor<br>Cassidy nor<br>Teno<br>Teno Professor Nicholson<br>ten Professor Cassidy<br>ten associate professor Hargraves<br>ten Professor Jackson ten AR friends and<br>colleagues Teno Teno<br>tenot it is my great pleasure to<br>introduce our speaker T night Professor<br>Tanya Cassidy from the school of<br>physical education Sport and exercise<br>science to give her inaugural<br>professorial lecture here at the<br>University of<br>otago as indicated by Professor<br>Nicholson tan was promoted to Professor<br>in February of this year and tonight we<br>get to celebrate this significant<br>achievement Professor Cassidy is a local<br>born in denen and spending the first 10<br>days of her life in what was once Queen<br>Mary maternity hospital in now Haywood<br>college she grew up in Mill in a Ed<br>Tyree high school she must have had good<br>teachers because she began her career as<br>a teacher having gained her diploma of<br>physical education at the University of<br>otago thereby joining the esteemed ranks<br>of the feds before gaining her teaching<br>diploma from Christ Church Teachers<br>College after nearly a decade of<br>teaching Professor C Cassidy obtained<br>her master of physical education from<br>otago in 1995 and then her PhD from<br>Deacon University in<br>1991 previously a part-time teaching<br>fellow in the PE School Tanya returned<br>to the university in a permanent role of<br>lecturer in 1998 I was also in the 1998<br>intake and I recall taking part in the<br>HD session on introduction to teaching<br>at the University with tan that year and<br>I think your presence was about the only<br>thing I remember from that<br>session not that it was a bad session<br>but you know it's just a long time<br>ago having risen through all of the<br>academic ranks at the University we now<br>celebrate T's promotion to full<br>Professor a great<br>achievement as we have heard from our<br>vice Chancellor promotion to professor<br>at the University of otago is far from<br>Easy it requires excellence in all three<br>academic domains of research teaching<br>and service and each of these Professor<br>Cassidy has excelled in research<br>Professor Cassidy is an international<br>thought leader in sport<br>pedagogy this is a field that she has<br>herself gr through the interdisciplinary<br>perspectives that she brings Professor<br>Cassidy has published two books 24 book<br>chapters and 36 Journal articles and one<br>of her books understanding Sports<br>coaching the pedagogical social and<br>cultural foundations of coaching<br>practice has appeared in four editions<br>and has been translated into several<br>languages including<br>Welsh Professor Cassidy's International<br>standing is demonstrated by recent<br>invitation to the research Committee of<br>the international Council for coaching's<br>excellence first Global Think Tank to<br>discuss what is coaching one of just<br>four world-renowned coaching researchers<br>asked to be involved in this<br>debate a standout feature of her<br>research has been her work with<br>postgraduate students having supervised<br>six PhD and 15 Master students in<br>completion students who've gone on to be<br>high Achievers in their own right this<br>includes Professor Jackson joining us<br>tonight and another standout for me<br>personally as local Elite track and<br>field coach Joan mery's um another of<br>our latest PVC Edition um once upon a<br>time I took a Coach Co a coaching course<br>from Jane at and Joan and so I guess<br>that means some of that<br>um learning that was passed on to Joan<br>flew through to<br>me Professor Cassidy is an excellent<br>teacher and in supporting her promotion<br>her Dean Drew attention to the<br>significance of their contributions<br>across all levels of the school's<br>curriculum singled out for special<br>intention wor her contributions to the<br>physical education and health major<br>which is unique among New Zealand<br>universities this impact extends into<br>nationally a 2018 review of her textbook<br>commented on the specialist underpinning<br>knowledge that was contained within it<br>and that was an extremely valuable<br>teaching and Learning Resource that<br>should be core reading in any<br>undergraduate<br>program in terms of service Professor<br>Cassidy has contributed across all<br>levels of the University but I want to<br>particularly mention her service to to<br>our Sports bodies Professor Cassidy sits<br>on the governance boards for New Zealand<br>hockey New Zealand football otaro hockey<br>football South and the otago Academy of<br>sport and it is here that excellence in<br>the academic world is driving excellence<br>in the sporting World motivated to make<br>a difference Professor Cassidy indeed<br>makes a difference I think that's enough<br>from me and it's now time to hear from<br>Professor Cassidy herself one of our<br>fantastic women in science here at the<br>University of otago please join me and<br>welcoming Professor T<br>Coto cotania casao welcome to my opl and<br>to my mother's 84th birthday party<br>isn't it great to be able to kill two<br>birds with one<br>stone um happy birthday Mom I hope you<br>have a great<br>party in the next 40 minutes or so I'll<br>focus on the journey that I've taken to<br>become a professor a journey which can't<br>stereotypical I wish to begin by<br>acknowledging my and thanking my parents<br>ion and the late Dennis Cassidy for<br>providing me with a strong Foundation<br>upon which to build my life<br>they are both Servants of our community<br>and served on numerous committees for<br>over<br>decades and uh it seems to be a practice<br>that I've<br>inherited as a child if I ever had a<br>question I'd ask Mom and if she didn't<br>know the answer then she'd inevitably<br>say let's go and look it up and we<br>trapes up to the lounge and look up our<br>two sources of knowledge the junior<br>World Encyclopedia or the peer<br>encyclopedia and if we couldn't find the<br>answer into those books the next<br>protocol was the uh Public<br>Library mom encouraged my curiosity for<br>the world and she's always been my sort<br>of fir supporter even though most of the<br>time she thinks what I'm doing is nuts<br>so again I thank you for that Mom and I<br>love you to<br>bits growing up DB was the sporty parent<br>and he had a very strong sense of social<br>justice and he wasn't he was prepared to<br>call out inequities when he saw them for<br>example in the 19 1980s he raised<br>questions about why some very talented<br>rugby players from the cook Island<br>community weren't being selected for the<br>tiger Rugby<br>teams while Dad was conservative in many<br>ways he did have the capacity to out to<br>think outside the square when it came to<br>coaching I remember thinking well I<br>remember him looking at ballet<br>teachers uh to teach his Fords how to<br>become better line out jumpers that was<br>before you could lift<br>them I also want to acknowledge and<br>thank my siblings Sandra Maria Maria and<br>Alex their partners and husbands Daniel<br>Matthew and Keith as well as my niece<br>and<br>nephews Georgia Jacob Jimma Toby Kayla<br>Um Zack Annabella Lewis Greta and<br>Rosa I love you all dearly and we're a<br>formidable team thank you also for being<br>my bedrock and for my sources of<br>inspiration for 20 years I had a<br>professional studies family in the<br>school of physical<br>education and I want to acknowledge your<br>friendship your collegiality and your<br>support unfortunately this family was<br>broken apart when we were restructured<br>in 2017 and tonight is the first time<br>we've all been back together again so<br>thank you for coming thank you for<br>occasion um I also want to thank the<br>current staff of the school um for your<br>support and especially those who<br>supported me after the the uh<br>restructuring uh and I really<br>appreciated the way you made me feel<br>welcome when I was invited back over to<br>the other side of the school over side<br>the other side of the<br>road now you don't become a professor<br>without engaging students and it's<br>lovely to see that I've got students<br>here today from the the the cohort of<br>2024 I've taught thousands of students<br>over the last 26 years and they've been<br>my guinea pigs of some of for some of my<br>ideas and some of which have<br>subsequently informed the content of my<br>textbooks I've also been fortunate to<br>have quality PhD students and master<br>students who have been curious<br>reflective and willing to question the<br>status<br>quo I wish to thank all of them because<br>our Collective Journeys have been<br>enriching and in times<br>joyous and and um as you can see on the<br>this Photograph at the bottom leftand<br>Corner this was a photograph taken at<br>graduation last year and it represents<br>part of my academic fuaa beginning with<br>Professor amarie Jackson who went on to<br>provide me with academic grandchildren<br>and great-grandchildren<br>I also want to publicly thank amarie for<br>encouraging me to apply for professor<br>without her gentle persuasion I would<br>not have done so and it illustrates the<br>immense value of AK and<br>tutin finally I wish to acknowledge all<br>of you who have tuned up tonight<br>physically as well as those who are<br>online I'm honored that you can make<br>time for me to support me on this<br>occasion and it's really great to see<br>everybody here um I thank you for be an<br>integral part of my journey knowingly or<br>professor while you have supported me<br>you may not be so familiar with what I<br>do how I do it and why I do it<br>so tonight I'm going to give you a<br>glimpse a we glimpse into the world my<br>working<br>world I've organized the IPL into three<br>sections I'm going to give a brief<br>introduction to the theoretical<br>orientations of my work I'll set the<br>scene by providing you with some<br>insights into my early experiences and<br>the um Associated interruptions which<br>have undoubtedly influenced my journey<br>to become a<br>professor and the final section we'll be<br>looking at the four priorities of the<br>professorate which illustrate my<br>scholarship of teaching Discovery<br>integration and<br>application as a researcher my work is<br>squarely located in the qualitative<br>Community an example of the membership<br>of my membership of that Community was<br>the invitation I received to contribute<br>to the rutage handbook of qualitative<br>research in sport and exercise edited by<br>professors Smith and<br>Sparks both of these editors are highly<br>respected and I've been reading the work<br>of Professor Andrew Sparks since I was a<br>master's<br>student often International colleagues<br>only know your work through your writing<br>so I was flattered that the editors a<br>knew my work and B thought I had<br>something to valuable to<br>offer the topic the title of the the the<br>chapter was challenging but what I<br>really enjoy about this work is the<br>opportunity to to write and in the<br>process of writing is to be creative and<br>learn a lot so I was pleased in the end<br>of how this work came together and I was<br>especially happy when Professor Brett<br>Smith said my work was a standout<br>chapter in this<br>book in qualitative research Theory can<br>take on many roles one such role is to<br>un to assist us to make<br>meaning tonight I focus my attention on<br>how and why I use Theory to make meaning<br>context throughout the IPL I weave I<br>will we weave two concepts experience<br>and Interruption with the aim of helping<br>you and me to to make meaning of what I<br>do why I do it and how I do it in my<br>work examples of which you highlighted<br>on the slide Gary burn and I have<br>suggested that our understanding of<br>experience could be further enhanced<br>with the engaging with the concept of<br>interruption particularly when it's<br>viewed as a mechanism to facilitate<br>Learning and<br>Development another theory I want to<br>mentioned tonight is social theory of<br>learning because the components of this<br>Theory resonate with how I learn and the<br>importance I place on belonging becoming<br>caring and wanting to make a difference<br>hence the first part of of my IPL title<br>learning to become dot dot dot in this<br>professor over the last two decades<br>scholars in the areas to which I who to<br>which I work in which I work have<br>represented their inquiry using a<br>variety of narrative genres I've<br>contributed to this body of literature<br>this is the second section and the<br>stories I've chosen to tell tonight<br>illustrate how my experiences the<br>interruptions and my desire to belong to<br>something bigger than just me have<br>informed my journey to become many<br>things including a<br>professor okay here's my<br>stories okay in my um on my primary<br>school entry records it stated when I<br>was 5 years old that I had problems<br>hearing as a 5-year-old I knew I didn't<br>want to be labeled as deaf because there<br>was a kid in the school who had to wear<br>a box around his neck because he was the<br>deaf<br>child so when I was summoned by the<br>visiting DEA nurse to go for a checkup I<br>knew I had to pass this test she gave me<br>headphones to wear and I was requested<br>to put pigs in the Box every time I<br>heard a<br>sound so I worked out very early on in<br>the piece that I could also see her<br>shoulder move every time she moved the<br>dial so I assumed that I can just then<br>look at her shoulder and put a pig in<br>the Box every time I saw her shoulder<br>move and therefore I'd pass so when I<br>went home and told Mom how clever I was<br>at defeating the the de nurse she wasn't<br>impressed and said you know it was not<br>the purpose of this that exercise<br>Taria but the experience highlighted to<br>me two things one was the importance of<br>being observant and two there are many<br>different ways of skinning a cat and I<br>never got taken back to the de nurse I'm<br>but as a kid I used to like being<br>outside mucking around and playing sport<br>I gave little thought to what I would do<br>after I left school except get a job<br>staying on until the seventh form or<br>going to University wasn't even on the<br>radar however at the end of sixth form I<br>did apply to go to Teachers College and<br>got turned<br>down that Interruption made me realize<br>that maybe I could go back to the<br>seventh floor and use that opportunity<br>to do some other things in<br>school to become a little bit more<br>well-rounded funnily enough I never<br>thought about using that seventh form<br>year to improve my school<br>grades in the seventh form my academic<br>form was fair to middling but at least<br>my English teacher recognized I had<br>potential thankfully I managed to get UI<br>accredited in the previous year year so<br>on the advice of my fed teacher I<br>enrolled I applied for the FED school<br>here at atago and got accepted into a<br>three-year diploma program but not the<br>four-year<br>degree it may come as no surprise that I<br>wasn't the most sophisticated or<br>diligent undergraduate<br>student in my first year at University<br>like at school I did okay in subjects I<br>enjoyed and those subjects that I didn't<br>I didn't do so well this was reflected<br>in my grades which ranged from A's to<br>e as I was first in family to go to<br>university I didn't know the language<br>was used in the institution or how to<br>study and for the first two years I<br>lived at<br>home I also didn't know that the norm<br>upon graduating was to get your<br>photograph taken outside the clock tower<br>not on pretending to be a bat and<br>standing on your childhood roof of the<br>playhouse and jumping<br>off I didn't I didn't twist an ankle but<br>it was a bit of a worry in the early<br>1980s in the school of phys the school<br>of physical education was restructuring<br>its curriculum and those enroll those of<br>us enrolled in the diploma were<br>encouraged to transfer into the degree<br>program I did apply but I wasn't<br>accepted this seems to be a trend<br>here the reason given for my<br>non-acceptance was they didn't think I<br>could cope with the content of the<br>degree program I remember being gutted<br>and feeling that they thought I wasn't<br>bright enough to do a<br>degree when searching through photos for<br>this presentation I came across a letter<br>that I received at the end of my second<br>year inviting me to transfer into the<br>degree program because my marks had<br>improved<br>then I declined that<br>offer my rationale for doing so was if<br>they didn't want me in the first year<br>all reflecting on that experience 40<br>years ago highlights me to me the role<br>of emotions and identities have played<br>in my journey as a learner The Letter of<br>Invitation was proof that I was bright<br>enough to do a degree but the emotional<br>residue um initially of initially being<br>declined a place influenced my<br>interpretation of the subsequent offer<br>The Narrative that I told myself that I<br>wasn't bright enough to do a degree<br>was an interruption that stayed with me<br>for many many years and and was a key<br>driver for me eventually to enroll in a<br>PhD upon graduating and Bill was a<br>teacher one of my teachers so thank you<br>for coming along tonight I did go to<br>Teachers College and taught for rock at<br>roxor area school for three years<br>teaching in a school was a Monumental<br>Interruption for<br>me I cried every day in my first year<br>because I didn't know what I was<br>doing by the third year I wasn't crying<br>anymore but I realized I was only<br>copying what other people were doing oh<br>Elaine Roxbury area school they so I've<br>got one from TY college or Ty high<br>school and one from Roxbury area<br>school um um um um so I wasn't crying<br>anymore uh but I was copying what other<br>people were doing or had done and I<br>didn't know how to change this pattern<br>of<br>behavior so I went to London and picked<br>up a position at a private prepatory<br>school at that time it was thatchers<br>England and working in the school really<br>highlighted to me how education was<br>viewed by some as a<br>commodity key to my time out of New<br>Zealand with the spouse I sent spent in<br>the Middle East and an Asia I love<br>traveling in these regions because it<br>fostered my curiosity in history<br>politics and world religions as well as<br>encouraging me to be open-minded and<br>calm these experiences okay maybe not<br>the arm part have been extremely<br>influential in my journey to become a<br>professor I returned home at the end of<br>1990 in time for the rowing season there<br>were no Grand plans other than to go to<br>Nationals at the end of summer and I was<br>pretty sure I didn't want to go back<br>teaching I still had one year left of my<br>tuition to study or free tuition to<br>study at<br>University so I thought I'd go back and<br>study politics history and phenomenology<br>of religion for for a year while I<br>decided what I wanted to do with my life<br>I went to an advisor who looked at my<br>undergrad transcript and said I needed<br>to enroll in a grad dip and go back to<br>faed<br>school he never asked me what I was<br>interested in and at that time I never<br>knew I could question him so I duly<br>enrolled and in the first two weeks I<br>went to the GV section of the Central<br>Library and looked at what the PE books<br>were on the shelves that was when I saw<br>Andrew Spark's book on curriculum and<br>micropolitics as well as the edited text<br>by David Kirk and Richard tinning that<br>linked curriculum culture and talked<br>about so-called critical issues it was<br>then I thought that maybe I could um<br>draw on my interests in politics and<br>history and and draw and Link that with<br>my background in physical<br>education I also found this quote from<br>Wick which has stayed with me ever since<br>the appeal of that quote was the freedom<br>that was was that the freedom to<br>experiment could be taken<br>seriously also in the GV section I found<br>a book by Roselyn Cassidy no relation<br>entitled curriculum development in<br>physical education which was published<br>in<br>1954 while the way Cassidy described<br>curriculum didn't appeal I did a<br>photocopy the inside page seeing that<br>book with the Cassidy name on the spine<br>must have sparked something because I<br>really remember thinking that one day<br>I'm going to write a book too<br>that photocopied page has also followed<br>me around for the past 30<br>years another memorable book of the time<br>was boa's text in which he outlined the<br>priorities of the professorate which I<br>mentioned earlier and I will turn to<br>later at the completion of my masters I<br>still didn't know what I wanted to do<br>when I grew up I was still curious to<br>learn and I still had a chip on my<br>shoulder that I was still too sick to a<br>degree so I enrolled to study in a PhD<br>with Richard tinning at Deacon<br>University in<br>Australia throughout my masters I'd read<br>work by staff at the in the faculty of<br>education at Deacon and they were<br>challenging the status quo in education<br>and physical<br>education I had a vague idea that I<br>wanted to explore physical education<br>from a critical perspective but again<br>there was no grand plan when I jumped on<br>the plane Bound for<br>Australia I soon came to realize that<br>the staff in the education faculty at<br>Deacon University were actually<br>International rock stars and it was<br>incredibly vibrant<br>environment it also highlighted to me<br>that despite having been a teacher I<br>knew nothing about educational theories<br>or how to<br>learn and it wasn't until I was uh<br>presenting my PhD proposal maybe eight<br>months into the um my tenure that one of<br>the staff said I think what you're doing<br>is a study on<br>pedagogy I'd never heard the term before<br>so I definitely didn't know what he<br>meant I soon became well versed in<br>lust's definition of pedagogy which<br>provided a framework for my<br>PhD I've subsequently added a to the<br>definition by recognizing the pro uh the<br>context in which that process occurs and<br>tonight some of the examples I provide<br>one of the studies uh or one of the<br>outputs from the PHD was this paper that<br>Richard and I wrote the key finding of<br>that study was that if you're attempting<br>to challenge the status quo there is<br>limited chance of change occurring if<br>the focus is only placed on the on the<br>mental processes of the learner for<br>genuine change to occur there needs to<br>agenda as I explained earlier the third<br>section of the IPL is organized around<br>boy four priorities of the<br>professorate I use his areas of<br>scholarship of teaching Discovery<br>integration and application to frame the<br>stories I tell about how I'm learning to<br>become a professor the first area of<br>scholarship is<br>teaching it was a tough initiation for<br>me into terer Life as a staff<br>member no no surprise there I had to<br>design and teach three new people papers<br>in my first year and while I I received<br>reasonable uh student evaluations in the<br>300 and 400 level papers I got<br>absolutely caned by the students in the<br>compulsory fizzy 2011 pedagogy paper and<br>I think some of the people here might<br>have actually been in one of those early<br>people I always have to apologize for<br>those first five years I got better<br>after<br>that the L the large majority of the<br>students couldn't see why it was a<br>compulsory paper they absolutely hated<br>it this was reflected in the results for<br>the question five and the student<br>evaluation St surveys where the students<br>were asked to rate how effective I was<br>at teaching the paper in 2001 only 14%<br>of the students rated me as effective it<br>is worth noting that to be a very<br>effective teacher 100% of the students<br>have to R you as either one or two on<br>that lart<br>scale there was a slight Improvement in<br>2002 with 39% of the students rting me<br>as an Effective Teacher<br>these student evaluations were a<br>definite interruption in my journey to<br>become a<br>professor one consequence of the very<br>poor student evaluations I received in<br>20 fizzy 2011 was I failed to be<br>confirmed as a 10e member of staff at<br>the University of atago I had one more<br>year to prove myself that I indeed was<br>an effective terer level teacher<br>otherwise I'd be<br>gone nothing like a bit of<br>motivation so I need to focus<br>so in fizzy 2011 I would and I still do<br>introduce the students to jy's notion of<br>becoming a reflective practitioner Emma<br>you can remember<br>that now I had to practice what I<br>preached so I went back to the finding<br>of my PhD which Illustrated the<br>importance of the students having an<br>emotional commitment to the change<br>agenda but what did that mean to me and<br>to the students in fizzy<br>2011 I surmised that a common<br>denominator across the student body was<br>that most of would have coached at some<br>would have been coached at some stage of<br>their lives so I decided to take a<br>punt and contextualize the pedagogical<br>Concepts that I've been talking about<br>into a sports coaching context I mean<br>what did I have to lose they hated what<br>I was doing already and the student<br>worse the following year when I<br>introduced the class to jy's view of<br>reflection I also put up this quote from<br>Wayne Smith that the coach of the All<br>Blacks in which he was pretty much<br>saying the same thing as<br>JY when this quote came up on the screen<br>the change of vibe in the lecture<br>theater was almost<br>palpable it was then I knew I was on to<br>something I went looking in the<br>literature for something to support what<br>I was doing but I couldn't find anything<br>so I went and asked a colleague who<br>Robin Jones who was on staff at the time<br>and his area was sociology of sports<br>coaching and I asked him you know could<br>he point me in the direction of people<br>who are writing in the area of pedagogy<br>of sports coaching and he said well<br>there isn't anybody to which I replied<br>well there's a definite Gap in the<br>literature and uh if you'd like to would<br>you like to help me write a textbook to<br>support what I'm doing in fizzy 2011 and<br>the rest is<br>history in 2014 the book was published I<br>was writing the book primarily to save<br>my bacon here at atago but in doing so<br>we highlighted a number of gaps in the<br>literature one major Gap was that there<br>were no articles identified as focusing<br>on the learning process or the athlete<br>learner using our text in the compulsory<br>fizzy 2011 pedagogy paper was a<br>GameChanger in 2004 the numbers of<br>students saying that I was an Effective<br>Teacher jumped to<br>88% on the basis of my improved teaching<br>evalu I was finally confirmed as a<br>confirmed tenur member of staff at the<br>University of<br>atago the experience I gained and and<br>having to<br>um uh turn around the student<br>evaluations has been<br>invaluable nowadays I get 98 to 100% of<br>students saying that I um course<br>consider me to Be an Effective Teacher<br>just so just remember that when you're<br>doing the student evaluation this year<br>98 to<br>100 when Professor Li Williams he was a<br>dean that appointed me was informed that<br>I'd finally been confirmed he responded<br>by saying I'm so pleased that she's been<br>supported institutions are often blind<br>to Quality in non-obvious<br>areas this is another quote that I've<br>kept with me for the past 20 years and<br>I'll be forever grateful for Liz to Li<br>for seeing my potential even though it<br>might not have been so obvious to<br>others as rich just said the text has<br>been uh has had a number of uh additions<br>and has been translated into Korean and<br>Welsh and also as a talking book by the<br>Norwegian library of for talking books<br>in<br>brail who<br>knew<br>um the book has hid reasonable re well<br>pretty good reviews really um and so it<br>was te ranked six6 out of thousand<br>bestselling books of all time on the<br>rage sport list and it's become<br>considered to be a seminal coaching text<br>uh for um undergraduate programs I<br>actually think the fourth edition which<br>came out in 2023 is much better than the<br>Third Edition so I'm looking forward to<br>the reviews on<br>that the second uh priority for Boya is<br>scholarship scholarship of Discovery and<br>I'll now provide two examples of how my<br>work contributes to the<br>scholarship the first example begins in<br>2003 and it coincided with me uh playing<br>around with the content of phizzy 2 1<br>and writing the first edition of the<br>textbook Steve Martin the rugby manager<br>at Tiger Rugby Football Union invited me<br>Paul Po and Alex McKenzie to develop a<br>social science theory based coach<br>education program for their<br>representative<br>coaches Steve which is who is here<br>tonight I to see you Steve thank you<br>Steve now Steve haven't done this my my<br>orientation would have been so different<br>so Steve thank you Steve's rationale for<br>approaching us was that theago Rugby<br>Union was smaller and had less Financial<br>backend than its main Rivals and<br>therefore we had to work smarter to<br>develop a point of difference 20 years<br>later in the fourth edition of the text<br>we refer to this as a desire to develop<br>a pedagogical<br>Advantage we agreed to run what we<br>called the code program what became<br>known as the code Pro program on the<br>understanding that we could do two<br>things use the ideas that we were trial<br>in fizzy 2011<br>and what we're writing about in the<br>first edition of the textbook and also<br>that I could interview the participant<br>coaches one of who is here tonight thank<br>you very much uh at the completion of<br>the code program about their experiences<br>of having been involved in the<br>initiative despite the participants<br>becoming from a range of educational<br>backgrounds one of the findings of the<br>subsequent study was that the majority<br>of the coaches did not recognize the<br>athletes as<br>Learners this reflected the lack of<br>discussion on learning in the in the<br>sports coaching<br>literature some of the reasons for the<br>resultant code study was novel was<br>because we use fen's framework of<br>curriculum change to evaluate and um<br>reflect on the merits of the code<br>program at that point in the sports<br>pedagogy field no one was using uh<br>educational curriculum Theory to talk<br>about or an analyze coach education init<br>initiatives the Cod study also differed<br>from previous studies because we didn't<br>try and measure the effectiveness of a<br>behavioral approach and we Ed<br>qualitative<br>methodology the second example who is<br>also sitting in this room thank you Joe<br>is Illustrated in the next two ex uh two<br>slides my graduate students often come<br>with considerable experience in the<br>workforce and strength and sports<br>coaching prior to enrolling in<br>postgraduate study thus their research<br>questions are grounded in real world<br>situations and the students are often<br>well connected to the communities this<br>was the case with iconic local Coach Joe<br>meriles who was interested in gaining<br>insight into the experiences of three<br>women Elite Performance coaches within<br>the New Zealand track and field<br>Community the participants in her study<br>were vastly experienced coaches as<br>identified<br>here to make manying of those women's<br>experiences Joan used vanger's social<br>theory of Lear learning specifically<br>focusing on how they learned to become<br>an elite coach and how this process was<br>identities some of the challenges faced<br>by the woman in Jones studies study was<br>also documented in the nation's media<br>one woman worked as a coach for 27 years<br>which included coaching at those<br>Pinnacle events all the while being a<br>volunteer another woman had a difficult<br>time with New Zealand track field when a<br>relationship between her and a coach<br>broke<br>down a consequence of this situation was<br>that she went off and took up an offer<br>in China and subsequently coached their<br>athletes to the Olympic<br>finals it was seven years later before<br>she finally secured employment as a<br>coach within the New Zealand national<br>body I highlight these stories to<br>illustrate the importance of Jones work<br>to shed light on the complex Journey<br>Journeys women can have in the process<br>of becoming an elect<br>coach her work might help explain why<br>women are under represented in the Elite<br>Community the under representation is<br>reflected here in the figures for<br>accredited coaches split by men and<br>women in the Olympic Games between 2010<br>and<br>2021 women made up 10% of coaches in<br>Vancouver in 2010 11% in London in 2012<br>9% in SOI in in 202 uh 2014 11% in Rio<br>2021 the ioc celebrated the 2021 figures<br>as reflecting a positive<br>trend to quote the Dixie Chicks I'm not<br>ready to make nice on those figures just<br>quite<br>yet if we drill down into the figures<br>for New Zealand it's even more a serious<br>state for example in 2012 only 4% of New<br>Zealand coaches attending the Olympics<br>were women compared to the international<br>figure of<br>11% in<br>2021 only 6% of New Zealand coaches were<br>women compared to the international<br>figure of<br>133% so in New Zealand we have even less<br>to celebrate when it comes to women<br>coaching athletes at the Olympic<br>Games it'll be interesting to see the<br>breakdown of coaches by gender in the<br>upcoming par Olympics which begin in a<br>few months time especially because I<br>suspect the ioc will be crowing about<br>the number of women athletes<br>participating in the games uh reaching<br>men the third priority for Boya is a<br>scholarship of<br>integration an example of the<br>scholarship of integration is the<br>process we undertook when writing this<br>textbook understanding strength and<br>conditioning as Sports coaching Bridging<br>the biophysical pedagogical and<br>sociocultural foundations of practice<br>now doesn't that roll off the<br>tongue then I'm a lead author of a book<br>that focuses on strength and<br>conditioning continues to amaze me<br>because as some of you know I don't even<br>know the difference between my jugs and<br>my<br>guns the authorship of this on this the<br>authorship team on this book and members<br>which we've got two others tonight so<br>thank you for and<br>LTE the authorship team on this book are<br>members of multiple and potentially<br>disparate communities with only two of<br>them uh having connections to strength<br>and conditioning yet all of us could see<br>the possibilities of developing learning<br>capabilities by establishing links<br>across the boundaries of our various<br>communities to the benefit of strength<br>and conditioning<br>coaches we drew on vinger social theory<br>of learning to understand ourselves as<br>brokers<br>working in an integrated fashion<br>required us to be open-minded and become<br>comfortable working outside our comfort<br>zones the reward for doing so was what<br>that was that we provided ourselves with<br>opportunities to think and write<br>creatively and this appears to have been<br>viewed favorably at least from those in<br>the governance level of the national red<br>American strength and conditioning<br>Association as evident by the professor<br>Jeff's review of our book<br>in this text We Begin most chapters with<br>narratives with the aim of providing<br>readers the opportunity to make an<br>emotional commitment to our change<br>agenda I'd previously experimented<br>experimented using these types of<br>narratives for a similar purpose six<br>years earlier when I was working with<br>three other colleagues one of whom was<br>Amory<br>Jackson the fourth priority and the last<br>one so hang in there we're nearly done<br>the fourth priority for is a scholarship<br>of application and it's to this I now<br>turned my<br>attention my interest in leadership came<br>about post the 2017 restructure of the<br>school of physical education which for<br>me and many of the others sitting in<br>this front row was<br>life-changing one of the less dramatic<br>changes was the management structure<br>within the school I became the associate<br>dean of external engagement holding this<br>role I was encouraged to attend courses<br>offered by the academic leadership<br>development program at the<br>University an unintended consequence of<br>doing so was that I began to explore uh<br>perspective Oopsy<br>Daisy<br>okay much has been made of New Zealand<br>Rugby uh's use of leadership group and<br>the development of the OES unfortunately<br>what I found on New Zealand Rugby's<br>publicly available free coach education<br>site for coaches called the New Zealand<br>Rugby toolbox did not instill me with<br>confidence with how they understood<br>leadership it was full of contradictions<br>and use of military references so you<br>can see there's a naval command lines<br>your troops the the most finest Skippers<br>are not Gods but you need a Herculean<br>work ethic or the best Captain is one<br>who says very little but a leader that<br>says nothing isn't<br>leading and don't get me started on what<br>they think about women as Leaders I<br>don't know what a figurehead is but<br>never mind won't go<br>there I it was inferred that the this<br>description was informed by Psychology<br>by referencing the concept of<br>trays but my question is how can coaches<br>make sense of this if they wanted to<br>develop as a leader or they wanted to<br>develop their athletes As Leaders oh<br>there's<br>Phil reading the work of chin and others<br>who challenged the established way of<br>viewing leadership and seeing leadership<br>potential of athletes such as Emma R<br>canu were Catalyst for me to think about<br>leadership<br>differently being based in New<br>Zealand for my last sabatical provided<br>me with opportunities to be the critical<br>friend of the head of female engagement<br>at the New Zealand Cricket New Zealand<br>Cricket have a female leadership<br>development framework which informed an<br>initiative to support their senior and<br>aspiring female<br>leaders one outcome of my applied<br>scholarship was the production of<br>theoretically informed critical case<br>studies that new Zeal and Cricut has<br>subsequently used in their<br>workshops these case studies were formed<br>using the insights I gained from talking<br>to the participants Frankie was one such<br>participant in the aspiring leadership<br>uh leaders initiative what I found<br>interesting and very was very excited to<br>hear was why she applied for and<br>accepted the role as Wellington<br>crickets Community manager for women and<br>girls it wasn't about Cricket rather it<br>was about Equity building communities<br>and creating better and sustainable<br>work this quote from Frankie provides<br>insights into how and why she leads and<br>how and highlights how she tries to be<br>explicitly disruptive at times one<br>alternative reading of her quote here is<br>that it could be viewed as that she uses<br>Development i' like to show you a we<br>clip now of that showcases some of<br>Frankie's work yay girls was initially<br>designed by Frankie as a Wellington<br>based initiative but it was so<br>successful it's been rolled out across<br>the country now keep your fingers<br>crossed<br>he<br>now I want to ask you when was the last<br>time you saw such a vibrant Cricket<br>practice oopsie Daisy that was a<br>surprise are we proscript to this<br>word okay well I'll just leave that<br>there but don't look at<br>it my work with New Zealand Cricket<br>challenges The View that boy's four<br>priorities of the professorate operate<br>in slos New Zealand cricket was<br>interested in me applying my scholarship<br>around leadership to work to the work<br>they were doing with the aspiring<br>leaders initiative but when in 2023 I<br>gave a conference presentation in<br>Singapore on leadership and use Frankie<br>story as a case study I was subsequently<br>invited along with my co-author Gary<br>burn to contribute to a special issue<br>entitled rethinking leadership<br>development contributions from Theory<br>and research in this article which Gary<br>and I haven't finished writing yet we<br>will explore leadership as a pedagogy of<br>interruption<br>this article will reflect boer's<br>scholarship of Discovery so my work with<br>New Zealand Cricket illustrates that<br>boer's priorities can be complimentary<br>rather than siloed which I think can be<br>only a good thing if you're wanting to<br>challenge the status quo and change<br>outcomes cue that slide now there's no<br>conclusion to this presentation because<br>learning is a journey which I hope to be<br>on until I pop my clogs uh but I do have<br>to wrap it up somehow so I'll do so by<br>explaining the props I used in my IPL<br>poster and return to boer's priorities<br>for the<br>professorate my mother tells the story<br>but when she enrolled me in Primary<br>School the teacher asked what was she<br>like as a child and she said give her a<br>book a bike and a ball and she'll be<br>happy well 55 years on pretty much give<br>me a book and a bike and a ball and I'll<br>be<br>happy um so that was the reason why I<br>use those props in the IPL lecture uh<br>IPL photo the colored photographs on in<br>this slide present represent another<br>Point Boer was making when he was<br>framing up his priorities for the<br>professorate he talked about having a<br>creativity contract and the importance<br>of professors retaining<br>Vitality to illustrate his point he<br>quoted Henry David throw an American<br>philosopher who is best known for his<br>book Walden a reflection on simple<br>living and natural<br>surroundings when thow why he was<br>leaving the solitary reflective life at<br>Walen Pond he said I left the woods<br>because it seemed to me that I had<br>several more lives to<br>lead in many ways tonight's presentation<br>is like my living academic<br>wake because for those of you who do not<br>know I'm taking voluntary redundancy in<br>8 weeks time I'm often asked why am I<br>leaving particularly now that I've been<br>promoted as a professor my answer is<br>very similar to that given by thorough I<br>feel as I have several more lives to<br>lead in my Post University life books<br>balls and bikes will still play a major<br>role I'm in the process of<br>co-authoring uh co-writing a children's<br>book with Seb in the audience I'll be<br>playing with a ball as a consequence of<br>being selected in the New Zealand<br>women's 60s hockey team for the upcoming<br>World Cup and I'll be riding my<br>motorbike off into the<br>sunset well all going well<br>Falls in addition to the books balls and<br>bikes is a boat because I've recently<br>been accepted as a volunteer watch<br>officer on the spirit of New Zealand so<br>I'll be sailing around the coast uh for<br>several weeks a year and finally if I<br>sit still for too long either my nieces<br>and nephews will ask me to do something<br>or my dog ruer will look at me with<br>those big brown eyes and plead with me<br>to take her on an adventure thank you<br>excuse me uh<br>tanoto<br>Ines it's with the greatest pleasure<br>that I conclude Professor Cassidy's<br>inaugural Professor professorial lecture<br>as the dean of the school of physical<br>education Sport and exercise Sciences<br>Tanya as she told you began her career<br>studying for the diploma in physical<br>education hadn't quite and realized she<br>didn't make it into the degree program<br>but she got the diploma so it's fitting<br>that she's now recognized with this<br>professorial appointment out of that<br>same uh<br>Department the work that Professor<br>Cassidy has presented to you today<br>demonstrates the outstanding<br>contribution and Leadership she's made<br>and continues to make to the Bodi<br>process underlying coaching practice and<br>as we've seen Tanya's contributions to<br>the field stretch from the foremost<br>textbook that undergraduate students<br>across the world use their studies from<br>Little Old New Zealand um her insightful<br>research articles to the impact that our<br>work has had in changing coaching<br>practices within sport organizations for<br>the benefits of athletes but also the<br>coaches<br>themselves um affectionately known as<br>tcast by past and present students<br>you'll be hard press hard pressed to<br>find a sporting organization in New<br>Zealand that doesn't employ one of her<br>students from a personal perspective<br>when I was deciding on whether to take<br>on this Dean position Professor Cassidy<br>kindly said she never wanted the<br>position herself but I could be assured<br>that she would always have my back and<br>I've appreciated her advice and support<br>um in the leadership positions she's<br>undertaken with the within the school<br>and I can confirm that she's always had<br>her back and look forward to that for<br>the next eight weeks um as Tanya<br>mentioned she's just been selected for<br>the New Zealand Masters hockey team so<br>there's life in the old dog uh yet um<br>and given her expertise I'm not sure<br>that I would want to take on the role of<br>our hockey hockey coach so I take my hat<br>off to him or her for taking on that<br>role and let's hope that they've read<br>her<br>book um<br>I um I'm so very grateful to be able to<br>celebrate this achievement with youan um<br>and I'll end by thanking all of you for<br>coming to acknowledge Tanya's um<br>achievements um and when we lose Tanya<br>from the Department I feel like we'll o<br>lose her mother who became an honory<br>member of Staff during lockdown who was<br>either doing the quiz with us answering<br>all the questions or writing the quiz so<br>we lose another staff member uh so um<br>thank you all for coming to acknowledge<br>Tanya's achievements and for those<br>watching online elsewhere in the world<br>for showing your support um we do get we<br>would like to invite you to the staff<br>Club after the formal proceedings<br>conclude to continue the celebrations<br>and to Tanya we have a gift for you to<br>remember this occasion before I pass on<br>to oh thank you very<br>muchar AO and I'm Marie and my role in<br>tonight's proceedings is to say a few<br>words for Professor Cassidy on behalf of<br>friends and Faro has been my academic<br>Mentor come up here<br>Tass TC punch of Judy we<br>are uh Tass has yes she has been my<br>academic Mentor colleague friend and<br>family member for over 20 years I was<br>actually in her class in fizzy uh 201<br>back in 2001 she probably was one of<br>those ones that gave me in the early<br>days to get up at 5 o'clock in the<br>morning<br>to just park that to the side and you<br>know we've been close colleagues as you<br>can see for over 20 years and as TC said<br>tonight the rest is history it's been an<br>absolute Delight to listen to your<br>inaugural prophec oral lecture tonight<br>you've shared tonight from a place of<br>deep humility your experiences the go<br>I'm tearing out a little B out here the<br>interruptions your desire to belong to<br>belong to something bigger in this<br>journey the importance of disrupting the<br>status quo of the change agenda and the<br>four priorities of the professorate in<br>this journey of becoming a professor now<br>I wish to challenge you in this<br>positioning and as I'm sure that we<br>could all agree that what you've shared<br>tonight is not the Journey of becoming a<br>professor rather it is that of being a<br>professor that is a status that you have<br>held and you have been operating at for<br>many many years prior to being awarded<br>the formal title in February 24 you've<br>always embodied the town and gown<br>philosophy of an ATO era of days gone by<br>a professional studies scholar and the<br>third female professor of professional<br>studies in the world thank you for<br>giving us a positive reason today to<br>come together tonight to celebrate you<br>you've always done things your own way<br>your IPL the timing is no exception and<br>you and you absolutely have oh I'm<br>getting there

journey through life the enang aamu<br>serves as a reminder that while we may<br>depart the Comforts of home when we<br>return home we are all the Richer and<br>wiser now I wish to conclude tonight<br>with acknowledging the people who are<br>the most important to her and that's her<br>family to her mom Mrs Cassidy Ivon we<br>know how much yes but I'll get a gr if I<br>said name from my

words<br>of of tonight are from tania's Mom and I<br>can just feel she be boring into me here<br>from getting tania's Mom to say a few<br>things thanks Alex Oh Tania told me a<br>few Tanya told this is Facebook<br>Messenger Tania told me years ago the<br>main reason she returned to denan from<br>her overseas work and study was she<br>realized she needed her family around<br>her we are we are sure glad she did<br>because the family needs her there have<br>been times we have shaken our heads and<br>rolled our eyes at some of our ideas but<br>one thing we can say is that life with<br>Tania is never boring Tania is the<br>loudest cheerleader for everyone in our<br>family from our most significant<br>achievements and Milestones to our small<br>everyday successes without fail Tania is<br>there giving support and praise and is<br>constantly<br>finding ways for us to to expand upon<br>those successes in the most genuinely<br>supportive way so it's so lovely for us<br>to be able to turn the attention the<br>praise and the spotlight onto her and<br>her professional achievements Tania is<br>naturally self-deprecating but we hope<br>she Embraces the well-deserved honor of<br>becoming a professor in the years to<br>come we cannot wait to see how she will<br>control us to do things we don't think<br>is possible thank you Tania for pushing<br>us out of our out of our comfort zones<br>I'd like to ask Rosa and Anga if you<br>would like to come up and to be able to<br>family thank you<br>Darlings thank<br>ready love love you too<br>and<br>finally my our professional
