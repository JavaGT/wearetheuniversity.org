that words can barely capture<br>my journey to this Podium has been one<br>of resilient courage and the unwavering<br>support of this incredible community at<br>the University of otago thank you so<br>much University of<br>otago when I first arrived on these<br>Shores I was stepping into a world<br>utterly foreign to me the land the<br>language the slang the Customs<br>everything seems like a puzzle waiting<br>to be solved and yet what truly made my<br>heart heavy was the absence of my family<br>leaving behind my wife and children<br>navigating this new landscape alone was<br>perhaps the toughest challenge I had<br>ever<br>faced adding to this was the realization<br>that I was a person of different<br>religious and cultural background the<br>initial language barrier only heightened<br>my sense of<br>isolation and if that wasn't enough the<br>trials of lost luggage and Visa issues<br>seem to conspire against<br>me but amidst these trials a Beacon of<br>Hope emerged the people of Tagle with<br>their warmth and kindness embraced me<br>wholeheartedly from the moment I set a<br>foot here I was shouted with love and<br>care making this distant land feel like<br>home the students Academia the neighbors<br>all ried around me offering support in<br>ways I never<br>expected yet I must confess that there<br>were moments of curiosity and<br>uncertainty that crept into my heart the<br>EOS of tragic events like 911 which<br>shook the world and cast a shadow of<br>apprehension were not lost on me the<br>fears of being judged misunderstood or<br>even discriminated against lingered in<br>the back of my<br>mind but here's what sets otago apart in<br>this community fear is met with<br>understanding ignorance with education<br>and Prejudice with<br>empathy it was here in this Heaven of<br>inclusivity that I learned invaluable<br>lessons I learn to accept challenges not<br>as obstacles but as opportunities for<br>growth I learn to embrace and celebrate<br>the richness
