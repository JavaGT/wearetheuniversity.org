our<br>inaugural lectures for<br>2023 for those in the audience who are<br>new to Academia let me briefly explain a<br>little bit about this ceremonial lecture<br>and why it is so important to us as<br>academics the inauguration of a new<br>professor serves two very important<br>purposes the first is for colleagues to<br>congratulate and welcome the new<br>professor on joining the elite circle of<br>what's referred to as the university<br>professorate this is always a train a<br>traditional Mark of Distinction for<br>universities all around the world the<br>second is to showcase the subject in the<br>story of a new professor to the public<br>it is the maiden lecture of an academic<br>that has reached the highest academic<br>rank above all it's a fun<br>evening inauguration is an ancient<br>ceremony that dates back to a time when<br>universities were small Elite clubs and<br>entry into the club was a public event<br>designed to impress Rich benefactors of<br>the importance of their continued<br>patronage ensuring that members enjoyed<br>a lifestyle befitting their Elite status<br>free from outside<br>interference the term Professor was<br>first used by universities in the late<br>14th century to mean one who teaches a<br>branch of knowledge and the word<br>prophura is actually an old French word<br>rooted in the Latin<br>professor as a person who professes to<br>be an expert in some art or science a<br>teacher of highest rank the augur<br>lectures are a wonderful opportunity to<br>welcome a new colleague and to learn<br>about their Journey the mentors that<br>have helped them along the way and to<br>celebrate this academic success and the<br>future tonight is our first inaugural<br>lecture for 20123 to be to be delivered<br>by Professor Joanna Montgomery I would<br>firstly like to offer my warmest<br>congratulations to Joe and would ask<br>Emeritus Professor Bruce smil to<br>Bruce good evening it's my honor tonight<br>to introduce this inaugural lecture by<br>Professor Joanna Montgomery um we have<br>overlapping research interests nature<br>prolation and we've collaborated for<br>around six years and I want to start by<br>saying congratulations Joe and you're a<br>wonderful colleague uh Joanna completed<br>her PhD at Tiger University in 1999 she<br>then went on to six years uh at Stanford<br>University in California as a<br>post-doctoral fellow and was then<br>actively recruited uh back to the<br>Department of physiology here in 2005<br>and was a foundation member of the<br>center of brain research from<br>2009 um Joanna's academic performance<br>throughout her career has been<br>absolutely exceptional Joanna has<br>published extensively with influential<br>contributions on plasticity which I<br>guess simply means uh adaptation uh<br>memory and and setting uh in the central<br>nervous system she's also pioneered<br>recent studies on uh the way in which<br>very similar processes in the nerve<br>Network which supplies the heart<br>contribute to heart rhythm<br>disturbance her work is recognized<br>internationally and nationally Joanna<br>has received numerous invitations to to<br>present speak at about her work uh and<br>great number of awards for research<br>excellence and an enviable and uh<br>valuable portfolio of prestigious<br>research grants again from both<br>International and National<br>agencies she currently holds James G<br>Fellowship from the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand Joanna is an outstanding teacher<br>uh she's contributed extensively to<br>neurophysiology courses and also sell<br>physiology courses at undergraduate and<br>graduate levels she plays a leadership<br>role in many of these courses and also<br>contributes at a high level uh to the uh<br>to the biomedical science degree program<br>Joanna has supervised and this is really<br>amazing supervised or is supervising a<br>total of more than 39 it's probably more<br>since uh since I got this sorry not 39<br>30 PhD and Master's students uh and she<br>also has mentored 19 and again that's<br>probably the the wrong number research<br>fellows finally Joanna is an editor and<br>editorial board member of several high<br>impact International journals she uh was<br>a key member of the group which<br>established manaki Manawa the Orland<br>Center for heart research and pahi<br>Manawa the associated National Center of<br>research Excellence uh and she<br>contributes at a high level to both so<br>this is a very incomplete and uh brief<br>snapshot of what's a remarkable<br>achievement like you though I'm really<br>Keen to hear Joanna tell us uh how all<br>about her journey to this point in her<br>career and how she was able to do all<br>this Jo congratulations and<br>looking K thank you so much for coming<br>tonight I really appreciate it it's been<br>a pretty rough last 24 hours especially<br>for us wisties so uh thank you so much<br>for coming out tonight I really<br>appreciate<br>it so the title of my talk the nuts and<br>bolts of what makes you tick what's that<br>about so for a long time I've always<br>described my research as really<br>describing or investigating the nuts and<br>bolts of what how the brain works so<br>what I mean by that is all the little<br>bits and pieces that come together to<br>make it work properly and therefore the<br>bits and pieces that go wrong when it<br>doesn't go doesn't when it doesn't work<br>properly and various diseases and so for<br>a long time I worked in the brain and I<br>still work in the brain um but more<br>recently I also look at how the brain<br>controls the heart as well and so why I<br>chose this title of the nuts and bolts<br>of what makes you tick is because what<br>makes you tick upstairs but what also<br>you know how your ticker works as<br>well so when I talk about the nuts and<br>bolts what do I mean so what I mean are<br>first of all these brain cells or<br>neurons so your brain has about 10<br>billion neurons in it um and this is a<br>image a photograph of a neuron that's<br>filled with a d and I think you can<br>agree that these are pretty damn<br>beautiful cells and they're really<br>unique kinds of cells as well probably<br>in high school you learned about a cell<br>and it was either a circle or an oval or<br>a square with a little nucleus in it<br>okay neurons are way more exciting than<br>that these very elaborate extensions<br>that extend off the central cell body<br>and these extensions are really<br>important for how your brain<br>works so what happens is that these<br>extensions what they're for is to enable<br>brain cells or neurons to communicate<br>with each other and so how neurons do<br>that are through contact points called<br>synapses and this is really where a lot<br>of my research is focused and trying to<br>figure out how brain cells communicate<br>through synapses and then how that goes<br>wrong in different<br>disorders so how does a synapse work so<br>in this cartoon here we've got a blue<br>neuron which we've designated the<br>sending neuron and the yellow one which<br>is the receiving neuron and if you zoom<br>in on this area here where they contact<br>each other this is where the synapse is<br>and so what you can see are two<br>different sides of the synapse this<br>coming from the sending neuron which<br>releases little chemicals called<br>neurotransmitters<br>and then on the yellow side which we<br>call sorry this not the post synaptic<br>side or the receiving neuron we zoom in<br>on that we can see these little<br>receptors here so they bind the<br>neurotransmitter and as a result you can<br>really rapidly communicate between your<br>neurons so you have about 10 billion<br>neuron uh neurons in your brain and they<br>communicate with about via about 10<br>trillion synapses that are in your brain<br>and so through these really elaborate um<br>extensions that come from neurons that<br>form these synapses you get these really<br>highly structured networks that form<br>throughout your brain and these networks<br>are really important for forming the<br>basis of how you learn things how you<br>remember all your cognitive functions<br>how you sense things how you<br>move and we know that synapses function<br>in a really really short time frame so<br>in thousandths of a second so let's test<br>that a little bit bit so I'm going to<br>give you a little bit of homework well<br>not homework it's right now work so what<br>I want you to do is when I flash up a<br>word I want you to say it out loud with<br>good meaning and what I want you to<br>think about when you do that is notice<br>when the word pops up how long it takes<br>for you to say it out loud and it would<br>likely be a really short amount of time<br>hopefully but what's happening in that<br>time is that the information is coming<br>through your eyes it's going and then<br>the information has to go all the way<br>back to synapses in your visual cortex<br>and then it has to come all the way<br>forward to the language centers in your<br>brain and then it has to come all the<br>way into your motor cortex so that you<br>can control the muscles then the<br>information has to go down to your<br>throat to be able to control those<br>muscles and then out to your tongue to<br>be able to control your tongue for you<br>to speak and all of that happens through<br>many many synapses in that very short<br>amount of time before you see the word<br>and then you say it so hopefully that<br>helps you appreciate it okay so you<br>ready right<br>go see how fast was that so let's do it<br>again but with a different word this<br>time um and again just notice how quick<br>you see it and then how quick it comes<br>out of your<br>mouth exactly see they really are and so<br>it just tells you just how fast those<br>synapses are working through all those<br>different Pathways for those words to<br>come out of your mouth so even when<br>you're having a rough day just read<br>something out loud and know that your<br>brain is actually pretty damn<br>good okay so something that's really<br>cool about synapses and the networks in<br>your brain is that they're plastic so<br>they exhibit something called plasticity<br>so what do I mean by that so that<br>communication that happens between<br>neurons it can get stronger and it can<br>get weaker and so as a result some brain<br>cells will communicate better and some<br>will communicate in a in a less strong<br>way<br>and we know through a lot of research um<br>that ironically was first published the<br>year I was born so I was clearly<br>destined to do this research is that<br>this happens when you learn like right<br>now you are learning about how your<br>brain learns and it always make does my<br>hi in a bit to know that I'm actually<br>doing it in my head and yet I still<br>don't know how I'm doing it so it' be<br>great to have a little wander around<br>your brain to know that so but what we<br>do know what's happening is that here is<br>a synapse say in a resting state so<br>here's that sending side of the neuron<br>filled with the chemicals here's the<br>receiving side of another neuron and<br>here's these receptors sitting on the<br>surface and so what can happen is that<br>with specific kinds of stimulation you<br>can get more receptors on this receiving<br>side of the synapse and what can happen<br>is some can also come from outside the<br>synapse and then move to be inside the<br>synapse as well so there's a really well<br>studied way that we know learning of<br>memory occurs in your brain at a<br>cellular level and something that's<br>really important we'll come back a<br>little bit later on this is that these<br>receptors here in blue are called the<br>Amper receptors they're the ones that<br>are really important for a lot of just<br>basic function of your brain these nmda<br>receptors here they only wake up or are<br>activated under very specific conditions<br>and often those are conditions that<br>require learning of memory for example a<br>lot of activity and a lots of a lot of<br>what we call depolarization of neurons<br>and a lot of repetitive activity so<br>that's often why you need that kind of<br>activity when you're learning and<br>there's been a lot of research done<br>showing that these nmda reers if you<br>block them for example you block<br>learning and memory if you have more of<br>them you can make what are called doogy<br>mice uh which I think in this audience<br>you might appreciate it more than my<br>19-year-old second year students who are<br>like who's dogy house I never heard of<br>him um but yeah that's why they called<br>dogy mice because he's very smart well<br>the mice are very smart so that's how<br>your synapsis undergo<br>plasticity so where did my interest in<br>all of this start so this started back<br>when I was a PhD student um at ataga<br>University and during my PhD um my<br>supervisor Dr roelly Mills recognized<br>that I needed a bit more than what he<br>could offer and so through an<br>international colleague we heard about<br>this course um in the um Marine<br>biological laboratory in Woodle in<br>Massachusetts and so it's an<br>international course that only accepts<br>12 students worldwide each year and<br>you're there for nine weeks you have a<br>lecture in the morning from 9: till<br>12:00 and then you're in the lab from<br>1:00 p.m. till about 2: or 3: a.m. and<br>you have that for 9 weeks it's pretty<br>intense but it's an amazing experience<br>and you have all these amazing faculty<br>from around the states these leading<br>scientists there is some fun though so<br>This Is Us dressing up as a neuron in<br>the Fourth of July parade we're not<br>actually a neuron here this is just a<br>photo um here's me I'm a little chloride<br>iron here um but what is amazing about<br>this course for me is that it I say this<br>you know that literally changed my life<br>and that sounds very dramatic but it<br>actually really did and I really<br>encourage students to take up these<br>kinds of<br>opportunities because first of what was<br>really exciting for me at the time is<br>that in these 3- week sections you get<br>to work one-on-one with some really key<br>leaders in your field and so I was so<br>excited to be able to work with this guy<br>here Professor Gabriel corus who was a<br>professor or still as a professor at<br>Harvard and I got to work home so me and<br>stepan here um who was now a professor<br>at charity University in Germany um and<br>also a really good football player by<br>the way um so we had a really great<br>three weeks with him and it was just<br>after the course he continued to<br>collaborate he sent me sales it made a<br>huge difference to the impact of my<br>research for my<br>PhD the other key person that I met<br>there is Dan this is Professor Dan<br>Madison so he was one of the course<br>directors and so he was there for the<br>whole nine weeks but I spent a lot of<br>time with him in the first three weeks<br>doing uh learning electrophysiology so<br>that's why Dan's wearing a a tin foil<br>hat because he's trying to ground<br>himself from the electrical noise um<br>real character but also as a result of<br>working for him for three weeks um I was<br>offered my post-doctoral position at<br>Stanford University and there's no way<br>that would have happened if I didn't<br>hang out with him for 3 weeks at this<br>course I thought I'd written to him from<br>Janan you would you know I doubt you<br>would have even opened the email so it's<br>such a great opportunity to be able to<br>work with these people and have just a<br>really great experience learning a lot<br>but also it just makes a huge difference<br>to your<br>career so as a result when I finished my<br>PhD I went to Stanford University where<br>I was there for six years and that's<br>where I did a lot of my<br>electrophysiology work so this is the<br>beautiful Stanford campus it really<br>literally does look like that um there's<br>the Hoover Tower beautiful um scattered<br>with Roden sculptures um around the<br>campus um but I spent six years in the<br>basement so I didn't see a lot of that<br>um and so this is me at my<br>electrophysiology rig so I spent a lot<br>of time sitting here you look on the TV<br>screen here some nice little neurons<br>here so this is how I learned how to<br>measure electrical activity in neurons<br>so what do I mean by that so when I say<br>electrophysiology what that is is a<br>technique that enables you to measure<br>how neurons communicate with each other<br>so it basically measures how synapses<br>work you get the electrical signals from<br>the brain cells live and in real time as<br>it's happening which is something that<br>is really cool and very addictive um<br>when you do it because you get this live<br>feedback on what the cells are doing so<br>this is what an electrophysiology rig<br>looks like you spend about $200,000 for<br>one of those and then you hold it<br>together with masking tape and blue tack<br>cuz you see that there's a lot of that<br>but I swear to god it works any patch<br>pler here will know that um and so if<br>you zoom in on what you can see under<br>the microscope here here we can see a<br>bunch of different neurons and what you<br>can see are these little electrodes here<br>so these are called glass micro<br>electrodes so what you do is you bring<br>these microelectrodes down and you<br>literally suck onto the cell and this<br>would never have been invented with<br>health and safety rules these days so<br>this is a Nobel prize winning technique<br>and what it does is basically so it<br>attaches onto the neuron with a really<br>high resistant seal and you can measure<br>the communication that's happening<br>between those brain cells so for example<br>if you stimulate this one oopsie on the<br>left so we call this the sending neuron<br>or the speaking neuron if you stimulate<br>this cell you'll see this electrical<br>signal here so that's called an action<br>potential so that's the electrical<br>signal that's coming out of that sending<br>neuron<br>and then if they're connected to each<br>other then the other one which will be<br>the listening neuron will have this kind<br>of electrical signal which looks a bit<br>upside down but this is what we call an<br>inward current so that's the ions that<br>are coming in through those receptors<br>that I talked about earlier so you get<br>these electrical signals so you know<br>that they're connected to each other<br>because in direct response to this<br>one firing an action potential you get<br>this incoming current in the next one<br>and that happens as I said before in<br>about four or 5 milliseconds so your<br>brain really is very fast at doing<br>that and what's really cool and what<br>I'll talk more about across the course<br>of um this talk is that you can do<br>electrophysiology in a bunch of<br>different cells provided that they're<br>electrically excitable cells so some of<br>the cells in your body are a bit boring<br>and they don't do much electrically but<br>neurons for example do so this is a<br>beautiful picture here of a human neuron<br>so I'll talk a bit more about that later<br>that you can do some recordings from<br>here's a beautiful heart cell a heart<br>muscle cell so that's another way that<br>you can actually another cell type and<br>I'll talk a bit more about that later as<br>well and these here these beautiful<br>cells here are neurons that are on the<br>surface of the heart and again I'll talk<br>a bit more about that later but you can<br>use this technique to get information<br>about how neurons are communicating what<br>kind of chatter is going on and<br>therefore get information about what's<br>right what might be going wrong and<br>therefore maybe how we can fix<br>it okay so during my time at Stanford um<br>I was really proud to publish some some<br>pretty damn good papers um so this is<br>the first of two neuron papers um where<br>I discovered that neurons in the brain<br>are connected by what we call silent<br>synapses so what does that mean what<br>that means is that it looks like or it<br>can look like neurons aren't actually<br>connected to each other at all and so if<br>you were doing this experiment here in<br>part A you can see the action potential<br>of that sending neuron and it looks like<br>and if you look at the line here Flat<br>Line nothing happening on the receiving<br>neuron so it looks like they're not at<br>all connected these neurons are not<br>talking to each other at<br>all but if you stimulate them in a<br>certain way what you can suddenly<br>uncover are these currents<br>here now these are currents that come<br>through those nmda receptors that I<br>talked about before the ones that are<br>really important for learning a memory<br>so what the showed is that you can<br>actually have synapses that don't look<br>like they're talking to each other or<br>neurons that are not talking to each<br>other but they actually are in certain<br>ways and you can then wake them up and<br>so suddenly now you can have currents so<br>what this gives is almost an infinite<br>level of plasticity happening in your<br>brain or potential for plasticity so you<br>have some synapses that look like<br>they're doing nothing but if you<br>stimulate them you can wake them up and<br>then suddenly they will be contributing<br>to the circuitry of your brain<br>and that's really important and great um<br>contribution for learning a memory and<br>that's in contrast to ones that really<br>aren't connected at all so you can see<br>that here nothing in response to the<br>stimulation special stimulation still<br>nothing and then nothing you can't wake<br>them up so those ones aren't connected<br>and of course there are some brain cells<br>that aren't connected to each other but<br>what happens is that you can really<br>wake these guys up and as I said before<br>contribute a lot to neural networks and<br>change ing the strength of neural<br>networks in your<br>brain the other really cool thing that I<br>discovered while I was at Stanford um is<br>that was a second uh neuron paper is<br>that yes you can have these synapses<br>called Silent synapses but you can also<br>have a bunch of other kinds of synapses<br>as well and so we call them States so in<br>your brain not your synapses are not all<br>the same if they were all the same why<br>would you have 10 trillion of them you<br>might as well have one or the you may<br>know people who possibly seem why they<br>only have one they don't um and so it<br>turns out so all your synapses are<br>different and they work differently so<br>if they're in different states that<br>means that their ability to change<br>strength and how they do that is<br>different depending on what's happened<br>in your brain beforehand and something<br>like trauma is a really good example of<br>that and there are ways that your brain<br>will deeply ingrain trauma into it<br>because it does it does it as a<br>protetive mechanism it doesn't want you<br>to forget that and so you will always<br>have potentiation at specific synapses<br>that basically make sure that that<br>traumatic event is not forgotten so it<br>doesn't happen again is the theory of<br>your<br>brain so this is just a cartoon of some<br>of these synapse States um that we<br>discovered and the details of this are<br>not so important but what's critical is<br>that basically what made this discovery<br>possible was doing these simultaneous<br>recordings from two neurons at once and<br>what I did what I did didn't say earlier<br>is that it's really damn hard to do a<br>lot of people do it from one cell but<br>not from two at once it makes it much<br>harder but technically difficult but in<br>terms of the information that you can<br>gather it's very very precise and<br>specific so it's worth the pain to do<br>it okay we did also have a lot of fun um<br>while at Stanford we played a lot of<br>touch rugby um with a bunch of other<br>kiwis Aussies Americans as well um this<br>is us playing I think we play for about<br>3 hours in the rain um that day but it<br>was a lot of fun the other thing that we<br>did and anyone who's in health and<br>safety will probably have a heart attack<br>when they look at this is that we<br>learned how to make liquid nitrogen<br>margaritas and so this is like my backup<br>career cuz they are amazing there's no<br>ice crystals in them at all and so<br>basically you just pour you know<br>Margarita and mix and Tequila into a<br>bowl pour liquid nitrogen in and mix and<br>it's a really good way to make<br>margaritas so that was for the lab<br>warning that we did although I wasn't<br>actually as horrified by just standing<br>there mixing nitrogen with no gloves by<br>but by noticing that I still have that<br>shirt and I still wear it um that was<br>horrified me more um but yeah it was<br>that was a good way to celebrate and<br>actually uh my boss was slightly<br>concerned he was like oh maybe we should<br>check there's not any additives in this<br>that could be a bit dodgy and so he<br>contacted the company and they said oh<br>no it's fine we do all this time we have<br>a recipe book would you like<br>it turns out you can make Heats of<br>things with liquid nitrogen um yeah so<br>also got a bit busy around then as well<br>um there's Josh he's up<br>there um so yeah so Josh was born while<br>we were over in the states um at<br>Stanford University so that was pretty<br>special<br>time so while I was at Stanford I worked<br>in two different Labs um so the first<br>lab was with Dan who I introduced before<br>um the second lab that I worked in um<br>was Professor Craig gner here um who I<br>still collaborate with uh to this day<br>and when I was working in Craigs lab<br>this is when I had more of a kind of<br>molecular shift so before we learned a<br>lot about the physiology of synapses how<br>they work so this was about looking at<br>well what underpins that what proteins<br>are underpinning how synapses work<br>what's actually controlling so remember<br>me showing you those receptors work U<br>moving before what's actually<br>controlling how those receptors move<br>because basically it turns out they're<br>just doing what they're told and the<br>real controllers are the proteins inside<br>the synapse that telling those receptors<br>where to go and what to do and so while<br>I was in Craig's lab I focused on two<br>major proteins one protein I talk about<br>about first called sap 97 and then<br>another protein called shank which I'll<br>talk a lot more about because we've done<br>a lot of work in that in my<br>lab so one uh really cool uh facet of<br>work that we did with this protein set<br>97 is show that this protein is really<br>important for getting nmda receptors to<br>synapses so remember those nmda<br>receptors are the ones that are really<br>important for learning a memory you<br>can't learn or remember things if you<br>don't have any nmda receptors they're<br>critical for learning a memory and<br>they're so important to the brain that<br>your brain actually has a specific<br>unique Pathway to get those receptors to<br>synapses so remembering that neurons<br>have these really elaborate<br>extensions what happens along those<br>extensions is that they're actually like<br>motorways so if you look here at this<br>movie you can see little dots whizzing<br>up and down the neurite extensions so<br>that also is happening in your brain it<br>happens a bit this is not quite in real<br>time um but it happens very very quickly<br>up these extensions and down them and<br>it's basically the center of the um of<br>the neuron communicating with synapsis<br>because that's the thing with synapses<br>they're often quite far away from the<br>control center of the cell so you've got<br>to have really good transport Pathways<br>um to use and so your brain uses these<br>little vesicles that run up and down the<br>extensions inside your brain cells and<br>so what we showed is that nmda receptors<br>go through a really different route so<br>there's kind of a traditional route<br>where you go through What's called the<br>endoplasmic reticulum and through the GG<br>and out to the dendrites but what<br>happens with nmda receptors is that they<br>skip the Gogi and they come straight out<br>of the endoplasm reticulum and then go<br>straight out to synapses and then these<br>little things called Gogi Outpost they<br>basically have little local Gogi that um<br>change the protein and then can get<br>inserted into the synapse and so it's<br>really cool that neurons have developed<br>this way this sort of special<br>trafficking Pathway to get these very<br>important NGA receptors out to<br>synapses the other work that we did that<br>that crossed many PhD students um in the<br>lab is looking at the role of sap 97 in<br>Huntington's disease so Huntington's<br>disease is a genetic disorder um very<br>disabling disorder a movement disorder<br>and um what we're doing here here is<br>doing some what we call super resolution<br>imaging so really high resolution<br>imaging where you can look at a synapse<br>that would normally in a microscope look<br>kind of blurry like this and zoom in on<br>the synapses and so in this example we<br>have the yellow side is the Press<br>synaptic side of the synapse the side<br>that's releasing the<br>neurotransmitter and then spooning with<br>that yellow you can see is red so that's<br>some receptors and proteins on the other<br>side the receiving side of the synapse<br>so they can get really high resolution<br>images of what's happening at synapses<br>and what this work showed is in<br>Huntington's disease what happens is<br>that the nmda receptors the ones that<br>are really important in learning and<br>memory and therefore really important<br>for motor learning and movement and what<br>you find is that the nmda receptors are<br>getting put in the wrong place so<br>they're getting put outside the synapse<br>so that's what this black bar here is<br>showing there's more of them outside the<br>synapse but but if you put more sap 97<br>into these brain cells what happens is<br>that you can move these receptors back<br>so there's less of them outside the<br>synapse and then if you do some<br>physiology on this work this beautiful<br>work done by voy what you find is that<br>normally with with Huntington's disease<br>proteins you get very little normal<br>synaptic transmission happening so<br>neurons are just not talking to each<br>other properly but if you add these<br>specific forms of SE 97 you can then<br>make normal synaps sorry this keeps<br>disappearing this you can make normal<br>levels of synaptic transmission so<br>normal levels of synapse communication<br>so it provides a cellular basis of<br>what's happening in the pathology of<br>Huntington's<br>disease so then part two of getting a<br>bit busy um is this is Zach so this is<br>he was born in Oakland hospital um in<br>2008 and I always think this is the most<br>wasted view of ever cuz who wants to<br>look at that<br>that so I want to talk a little bit<br>about my sabatical now and then a little<br>bit later um which are just amazing<br>opportunities to really have time to<br>think um and I really value uh these<br>sabatical times so we took uh I took my<br>first sabatical in 2010 we're in the<br>states for six months so we spent two<br>months back in Woods Hall so it was<br>really cool to take my family back to<br>Woods Hall where I'd been as a PhD<br>student and actually showing them this<br>is at Martha's Vineyard I think on the<br>nearby um but there I worked with Bill<br>Green uh and Paul salvin and this is PhD<br>student an Kai um and this is where we<br>we're doing a lot of this work extending<br>from what I showed you about the<br>motorways of proteins that are occurring<br>in your brain we then spent a month in<br>Chicago so bill here is actually from<br>Chicago at the University of Chicago so<br>we spent a month in Chicago and his wife<br>Grace<br>and then we spent 3 months back at<br>Stanford in the Bay<br>Area so during this time this really<br>solidified um and extended my work from<br>not just sap97 but another protein<br>called shank which to this day we still<br>do a lot of work in my lab on and so<br>this protein here shank forms the<br>foundation of a<br>synapse so why did we get interested in<br>these shank proteins um first of all<br>because at the time we didn't know much<br>about them we knew that they were really<br>important if you if you didn't have any<br>shank proteins synapsis didn't work<br>properly so we knew they were really<br>important but the other thing that came<br>out around this time or a bit later was<br>that shank proteins um carry a high<br>number of genetic variants that occur in<br>autism spectrum<br>disorders and so there's a number of<br>different kinds of variants or mutations<br>that happen in this protein and this<br>happens and has a high correlation with<br>autism there's also another um syndrome<br>called felin mcdermid syndrome um which<br>is also a genetic condition and this is<br>highly associated with profound autism<br>and this results from a either a<br>complete or a partial deletion of the<br>shank 3<br>protein and we've been really fortunate<br>to have families with children with the<br>m dermat syndrome come to our lab twice<br>now and visit um and I'll talk a bit<br>later about um saar's work there we're<br>going to get off the ground for that so<br>there's three different shank proteins<br>shank one Shank 2 and shank three and we<br>focus mostly on shank 3 we've done a<br>little bit of work on the others but<br>this is the protein where the highest<br>number of genetic variants occur with<br>autism so that is why we're really<br>interested and these children are really<br>severely affected so they are completely<br>nonverbal have a lot of um gut issues<br>often are are unable to move um it's<br>really heartbreaking you know talking to<br>the parents and just them saying things<br>like I I really wish I could ever all<br>I'd want in life is to have to hear my<br>child say Mom and things like that just<br>just really break your heart so these<br>are really severely affected<br>children and so some of the initial work<br>we did showed that if you have these<br>autism variance in this shank protein<br>then brain cell communication is much<br>weaker and so we can see this using<br>electrophysiology that I've talked to<br>you about about how we do that and so we<br>have our cells that have the the what we<br>call the wild type or the control shank<br>protein and then we have cells that have<br>these different variants of the shank 3<br>protein that occur in autism and so what<br>you can immediately see is that these<br>currents are much smaller than in the<br>controls and then we can see this also<br>in what we call a failure rate so when<br>synapses communicate doesn't happen with<br>every stimulation sometimes the synapse<br>what we call fails and so nothing<br>happens and so what happens is this this<br>is pretty rare when you have the control<br>shank 3 protein but it happens a lot<br>more in neurons that Express um these<br>variants of shank 3 that happen um with<br>autism and this is beautiful work done<br>by previous postdoc shot<br>time so what we discovered and we got<br>interested in zinc um was because we<br>know that shank proteins are really<br>highly influenced by zenc so in order<br>for shank protein to form that really<br>strong Foundation across the synapse<br>they need zinc to do that and so<br>beautiful work done by Dr Kevin Lee here<br>um has shown that showed initially that<br>if you add zinc even just transiently<br>you can then make synapses communicate<br>better and you take the zinc away and it<br>gets<br>weaker and so this was really important<br>data because what this showed is that<br>shank variants that carry an Autism<br>mutation basically still respond to zinc<br>so this was really exciting like okay<br>because that means that if they still<br>respond to zinc then zinc is something<br>that we can pursue and so in order to do<br>that and to think more about that um was<br>at sabatical number two where we spent<br>six months um in Berlin at charot<br>University um with Craig who I talked<br>about earlier who I did my second postt<br>with here this is Craig and this is<br>lovely wife Abby um it was such a good<br>six months it was like those two was<br>like having family with us it was so<br>cool um and the boys had a great<br>experience um both within Germany and<br>around Europe for that six<br>months and so from that sabatical came<br>and after a lot of thinking and talking<br>came a really long program of work that<br>I think went on for five or 10 years in<br>the lab and Kevin and Y look nervous<br>about this so this is an awesome forsome<br>here such an awesome forsome um so this<br>is Kevin and ywan married couple<br>extraordinaire but they look a bit<br>nervous and it's probably because ywan<br>gave birth to twins the next<br>that was at our he te um and this is<br>Shantel and Yuki so Shantel and Yuki<br>both did um their phds with me and then<br>carried on and did posts with me and<br>then Kevin also um actually Kevin S is a<br>summer student honor student PhD student<br>research fellow he's I think we've been<br>like working together for 14 years now<br>um so yeah so this awesome foresome<br>really helped my lab take this idea of<br>what does zinc do in neuron to the next<br>level so this initial work is done in<br>animal models of autism and feeling MC<br>deran syndrome and so what the<br>experimental plan for these these<br>experiments was um in the first set we<br>were doing what we call postnatal Zinc<br>supplementation so um the pups were born<br>from mum and then when they when they<br>weaned at 3 weeks they went on a diet<br>where they had zinc supplementation so<br>increase in of their diet and then we<br>did um behavioral and electrophysiology<br>experiments the second way that we did<br>these experiments was to supplement the<br>mom and so the mom had a high zinc diet<br>the pups were born and then they just<br>had a normal diet for them so they only<br>got the high zinc when they were with<br>Mom and so what we found and I'm<br>condensing so much beautiful work into<br>just a few slides here what we found is<br>that dietary zinc can either prevent or<br>reverse a lot of autism related<br>behaviors and so here um on the left<br>hand side we're looking at uh repetitive<br>grooming so this is a repetitive<br>behaviors that often often happen um<br>with autism and this is in two different<br>kinds um of rodent models here and so<br>you can see in control mice how much uh<br>repetitive grooming is happening how<br>that's much higher in a shank knockout<br>mice but then if you give the mice a<br>high zinc diet or this in this case<br>actually if you give Mom the high zinc<br>diet what happens is that those<br>repetitive behaviors are now at control<br>levels so you can either prevent them or<br>reverse these repetitive beh behaviors<br>there's also high anxiety um behaviors<br>especially in animal models of autism<br>and this is also seen in people with<br>Autism and so this test what it does is<br>looks at how often the mice like to be<br>out in the light and if you're very if<br>mice are very anxious they will stay in<br>the dark they won't come out into the<br>light and so what we see in control mice<br>is that they will come out and spend<br>quite a bit of time in the light the<br>shank 3 knockout mice the autism mice or<br>the PMD mice will not do that if you<br>give them high dietary zinc then they<br>will come out and spend as much time is<br>the control<br>mice now social deficits are also a<br>major part of autism spectrum disorders<br>and mice are very social animals and so<br>this can be tested here and so again we<br>found if you gave postnatal zinc or if<br>you gave mum zinc you could prevent or<br>reverse this Behavior so here on the<br>left hand side you can see in a control<br>mice mice um control mice will far<br>prefer a mice a mouse they don't know to<br>one that they do CU they want to learn<br>and and socially interact more<br>but the mice that carry these shank 3<br>variants won't do that they just don't<br>really decipher between the two but<br>those that have had a high zinc diet now<br>suddenly strongly prefer the new mice<br>over the old mice and in another U Mouse<br>model what we find again same thing wild<br>type control mice enjoying interaction<br>not so much that the autism mice but<br>then this is brought back to control<br>levels with this High dietary<br>Zink and what's important is that you're<br>seeing these changes you see them at the<br>behavioral level but you also see them<br>at the synapses within the brain so this<br>is what is underpinning what you're<br>seeing in terms of behavior so what<br>you'll see for example is changes in the<br>current so this is an example of some<br>work done by Kevin where you can see<br>that the currents this is control the<br>currents are much smaller in the in the<br>autism mice but they get bigger again in<br>response to the high zinc diet and one<br>way that we know that they do that is by<br>bringing other shank proteins back to<br>the synapse and so what we see is that a<br>normal the control mice here and in the<br>autism mice there's less shank at the<br>synapses but with a high zinc diet it's<br>bringing more shank back and we think<br>this is part of the mechanism of how<br>things are reversing and how that's<br>underpinning those changes we're seeing<br>at the behavioral level so it's been a<br>real focus in that in my lab looking at<br>a zinc Link in autism and fing mcdermid<br>syndrome so to kind of bring all that<br>together what we know is that genetic<br>variants that occur with autism they<br>alter how your synapses work they alter<br>their structure and they alter how they<br>undergo<br>plasticity and what's also really<br>important is that these variants um that<br>occur with autism still respond to zinc<br>so that's really important because that<br>means that zinc is something that we can<br>use as a potential therapeutic<br>pathway and that we can reverse some of<br>these as autism Associated behaviors<br>with dietary zinc and that these<br>behavioral changes correlate with<br>changes at the structure and function of<br>synapses<br>so how do we actually translate this to<br>humans<br>so you know obviously these are mice and<br>often when I talk to people about how<br>we've done some work on autism mice they<br>was like how does that work um but these<br>Mouse models are great but obviously<br>we're not mice and we need to be able to<br>make this effective in human cells so<br>how do we do this in human cells this is<br>obviously a lot more tricky and so what<br>we've had going on going in the lab and<br>work led by Dr anakah wimbo here um is<br>looking at human cells using human stem<br>cells and so what you can do is you can<br>take for example blood cells from a<br>patient and you can turn those blood<br>cells into any type of cell in the body<br>through different ways of stimulating<br>these cells and what anakar has done in<br>this beautiful work is turn blood cells<br>into Beating Heart cells so if you look<br>at this little movie here closely you'll<br>see the cells are actually beating can<br>you see that hopefully you can so these<br>are little heart cells beating in a dish<br>and these are human cells and so it<br>gives us the opportunity to be able to<br>study human cells in the lab and so<br>anaka has a beautiful program of work in<br>which you take these blood samples from<br>patients with something called Long QT<br>syndrome which is a gen gentic um<br>arhythmia so an abnormal heart rhythm<br>that's the leading cause of sudden death<br>in young people and she's done a lot of<br>work looking at both the heart muscle<br>cells and also the neurons that are in<br>the heart and looking at how these are<br>changed with Long QT syndrome and then<br>feeding that back to aim is to feed this<br>back to patients to try and better<br>Target pharmaceutical treatments for<br>Long QT syndrome so we know so this is<br>beautiful work here looking at heart<br>cells but we know that you can also make<br>brain cells or neurons from blood<br>cells so in work that's just started in<br>the lab um by PhD student Zoe Mills is<br>um to basically try and do this with<br>autism and try and understand because we<br>have no idea what zinc does to human<br>neurons we know what it does to the mice<br>no idea if it does the same thing in<br>human neurons so this really is going to<br>be a therapeutic strategy we really need<br>to know what it does to human neurons<br>and so in this work um that Zoe's doing<br>uh we'll be generating stem cells um<br>from fing mcdermid patients turning them<br>into neurons human neurons and then<br>testing what zinc does to their cells<br>and so watch the space over the next<br>couple years as Zoe does a PhD in this<br>really cool<br>work okay so what about outside the<br>brain we know I've talked about got 10<br>billion neurons inside your head in your<br>brain but there's also a lot of neurons<br>that are outside your brain as well<br>and so for example you have nervous<br>systems that are really important for<br>controlling a lot of your organs so we<br>have What's called the parasympathetic<br>nervous system and the sympathetic<br>nervous system so the sympathetic<br>nervous system is what underpins that F<br>or flight response when you have a lot<br>of adrenaline through your body it's<br>your body's way of basically making you<br>able to for example run away from a<br>threat and and your parasympathetic<br>nervous system is your rest and digest<br>system that's really important um for<br>example for digestion and so these<br>nervous systems obviously come with a<br>lot of neurons that are outside um your<br>head and so we've been really interested<br>in plasticity in these kinds of neurons<br>as well and so my interest in what's<br>actually happening outside the brain<br>started with some beautiful work with<br>Peter who's going to talk at the end<br>here um showing how there's a lot of<br>plasticity involved in how the bra brain<br>controls hearing and so you can see this<br>here with development what happens is<br>that if you look at these red lines here<br>these are all nerves coming in to your<br>to the cckar of the ear to enable you to<br>hear but really early on in development<br>there's lots of fibers here and then<br>what happens with time is that those<br>synapses disappear and so this is a<br>really fundamental way that your brain<br>wires itself it kind of overcompensates<br>it first and forms lots of synapses and<br>then just selectively prunes back ones<br>so that you actually have S of a<br>correctly wired brain in the end so we<br>had you know so this is work that i'<br>done quite a while ago looking at<br>synapse plasticity outside the brain and<br>so we thought okay we can do some more<br>of this and through um various ways I<br>got really interested in what's<br>happening to the neurons on the surface<br>of the heart and so a lot of people<br>don't know this but you have what called<br>clusters of neurons they're called<br>ganglionated Plexi or often called<br>little brains that are on your heart<br>surface so if you look on the left hand<br>side in this cartoon here's your brain<br>obviously and you have nerves coming out<br>from the brain and on the surface of the<br>heart depicted by these little dots are<br>these little brains or these<br>ganglionated Plexi and this is what they<br>look like so these a clusters of neurons<br>here all scattered over the surface of<br>your<br>heart okay so why should we care about<br>these neurons what do they do so we know<br>they're really important in controlling<br>heart rhythm and so obviously it's<br>important for keeping and they're the<br>last port of controlling heart rhythm so<br>there signals that come from your brain<br>but these neurons are the last ones that<br>are in charge that do the control and we<br>know that they play a really important<br>role in an arhythmia called atrial<br>fibrillation or AF so AF is the most<br>serious um and most common not the most<br>serious the most common abnormal heart<br>rhythm and um it does have some very<br>serious side effects unfortunately it<br>increases your risk of having a stroke<br>five-fold um three-fold increased risk<br>of heart failure and doubling your risk<br>of dementia and so what happens in af is<br>that the Atria the top chambers of your<br>heart basically beat very erratically<br>and what happens with that is that it<br>increases coagulation or clotting of<br>your blood and that's why you have an<br>increased risk of stroke and also why<br>you have an increased risk of dementia<br>because those tiny little clots can go<br>to your brain and and form you know tiny<br>Strokes basically<br>so it's a very common disorder um as you<br>age unfortunately the the frequency of<br>this happening increases significantly<br>so if you're aged over 75 12% of the<br>population are affected by a so it's<br>pretty damn High um it actually starts<br>you know relatively common even early<br>it's really highly associated with high<br>blood pressure so 60 to 80% of people<br>who have high blood pressure also have<br>AF so it's really important that we<br>figure out what's going on here so as I<br>said before these neurons that are on<br>the surface of your heart we know<br>they're important in controlling your<br>heart rhythm but there's so much we<br>don't know about these neurons<br>especially in<br>humans um and what we wanted to know is<br>okay because when I first heard about<br>these neurons I thought okay well what's<br>going on is that these neurons that are<br>on the surface of the heart they must be<br>changing their function with AF and<br>that's what's causing AF and I'll go and<br>read about that so went to read about<br>that but turns out we didn't know that<br>at all no no one had done these<br>experiments and so I was like okay so<br>then let's do it um so then into Dr<br>Jesse Ashton here um who did a lot of<br>work helping me bring this the string to<br>life and doing recordings of these<br>neurons on the heart surface and so what<br>JC found so these here I showed you this<br>picture earlier these are the neurons on<br>the surface of your heart so this is one<br>of those glass micro electrodes that<br>enables you to do electrophysiology on<br>these neurons and as a result you can<br>read the chatter or look at the chatter<br>these currents that are happening in the<br>neurons and so if you look at that what<br>you find is in an animal model which is<br>hypertensive and has AF there's much<br>more chatter happening in these heart<br>neurons that are hypertensive and have<br>AF and also what's happening is that<br>they have a much higher number of<br>synapses than the ones that are not<br>hypertensive and don't have AO so you<br>can see they have a much higher number<br>of synapses they also have a much higher<br>number of receptors so remember I showed<br>you in the brain how those receptors<br>move into the synapse when you learn and<br>remember things and undergo plasticity<br>so what happens is that with AF and high<br>blood pressure these neurons have more<br>of these receptors as<br>well and then J Smith who was a PhD<br>student in the lab that finished up last<br>year also developed um some techniques<br>to be able to look at the excitability<br>of these heart neurons using something<br>called calcium Imaging so so here you're<br>more looking at changes in light that<br>are happening you put a Dye you inject a<br>Dye into the uh the heart neurons and<br>then they glow when they get<br>activated and so what Justin found if<br>you look at these um so then you<br>quantify this these are basically the<br>amplitude of the currents that of the<br>fluoresence that results from this dye<br>and so what she found is that these<br>heart neurons again are much more<br>excitable in neurons that are from<br>animals that have AF and are very<br>hypertensive so what we show from this<br>work is that you not only is your brain<br>plastic but also the out outside your<br>brain the neurons outside your brain<br>also have a lot of plasticity so just<br>not just in your head but also in your<br>heart and in other places as well so we<br>know that these neurons that are on the<br>surface of your heart are changed with<br>high blood pressure and with atrial<br>fibrillation and So currently um what<br>we're going to do is to try and figure<br>out okay so basically these neurons have<br>changed can we use plasticity to change<br>them back and if you change them back<br>does that then restore normal heart<br>rhythm and make it harder for your heart<br>for example to be an AF in natural<br>fibrillation so we'll watch that space<br>again we need to look at this in humans<br>though so how do we study this in living<br>human cells so quick diversion turns out<br>we could do this already but in other<br>ways um so in some beautiful work done<br>by Dr Kevin Lee and Dr Thomas Park up<br>the back there um in collaboration with<br>um with Mike we've been we've done for<br>many years some work looking in the<br>human brain and being able to actually<br>grow human neurons so these neurons are<br>obtained from surgeries often from um<br>cero blastoma surgeries or brain tumor<br>surgeries where the surgeon has to go in<br>and remove the tumor but in order to get<br>the tumor tissue out they have to take<br>out a bunch of tissue that's not got<br>tumor tissue in it and that used to just<br>not be used anymore that basically went<br>in the bin so what happens is that<br>Thomas collects this um normal non-tumor<br>tissue and then you can grow take these<br>neurons out dissociate them and then<br>grow them in an incubator for many days<br>and then Kevin did some beautiful<br>electrophysiology to show these are<br>human neurons and these are the<br>electrical signals when you stimulate<br>them<br>and so Kevin then took this to the next<br>level as well by looking at not just<br>neurons that are dissociated in a dish<br>but actually grew what we call slices of<br>tissue so when you get a a large piece<br>of the human brain tissue you can cut it<br>up into slices and then what that does<br>is keeps the architecture alive so all<br>the connections are still maintained and<br>what he did is some beautiful<br>electrophysiology work showing some<br>really lovely electrical activity<br>happening in these human neurons um both<br>in one slices that he did immediately<br>and ones that he grew for many days and<br>I won't go into the details but it was<br>really important to show that our H our<br>neurons in some ways are very similar to<br>what we see in rodent models for example<br>but also different in other ways so<br>we're not the same which is not<br>unexpected obviously um but it's really<br>important to try and figure out how<br>we're different and what that might mean<br>so thought okay we've done that in the<br>brain let's see if we can do that in the<br>heart and see if we can do some<br>physiology on these heart neurons and so<br>sort of again fast forwarding a lot of<br>work um we're able to get what we call<br>epicardial Fat samples so these neurons<br>that are on the surface of your heart<br>they live inside fat pads so you can see<br>this in the white here so there's fat<br>pads on the surface of your heart and<br>inside those fat pads are where these<br>neurons live and so you can see that<br>these so if you sort of cut one of these<br>parts of the these neurons or these CES<br>of neurons in half you can see these<br>neurons sitting inside here and there's<br>heaps and heaps importantly of synapses<br>in these<br>neurons and so what the plan is and<br>still is um is to basically look at the<br>physiology of these human GP neurons no<br>one has ever recorded from these neurons<br>before so we don't know a lot about how<br>they work in fact we don't know anything<br>about how they work at a cellular level<br>and so again Jesse did a lot of work in<br>this and trying to figure out how these<br>might differ in p patients that have<br>abnormal heart rhythms specifically in<br>now for our Focus atrial<br>fibrilation and this was a happy day in<br>the lab so this is our first electrical<br>recordings of those neurons that Jesse<br>got um and I'm when I say it's difficult<br>to record from these neurons are<br>massively um underestimating an an<br>Jesy so to put all this data together<br>and we're still have more data coming<br>obviously what you can see is beautiful<br>electrical activity happening in these<br>neurons some of the are really really<br>electrically active some less so what we<br>find is that when you look at patients<br>that do or do not have HR filation the<br>sort of basic neuron properties are very<br>similar but what's interesting is that<br>the amount of stimulation that you have<br>to give them for them to fire one of<br>those spikes is much less in people who<br>have AF to those who don't have AF which<br>suggests that similar to what we saw in<br>the rodent studies that these neurons<br>are more excitable in humans with AF<br>than those without AF another really<br>cool thing about these neurons is that<br>they're really complex so this is a<br>neuron from a rat heart it's quite what<br>we call Simple they've got a kind of a<br>couple of Stumpy projections and that's<br>about it whereas the human ones are much<br>more elaborate and much more complex so<br>again it's really important and all<br>these little dots here these are all<br>synapses on one of these neurons so<br>that's really cool to see that and know<br>there's lots of synapses on these<br>neurons and now we want to understand<br>how much plasticity is happening at<br>those<br>synapses and so some work that I've been<br>doing with Bruth that introduced me<br>earlier is doing some what we call large<br>tissue Imaging of these neurons of the<br>heart so you can actually U Bruce can<br>explain way better than I can this very<br>complicated microscope basically but<br>this is like a whole little brain here<br>this is a whole if you look really<br>closely you can see little dots each one<br>of those little dots is one neuron and<br>so you can kind of get to step back and<br>see from a sort of a very kind of you<br>almost to do flythroughs and I'll show<br>you a movie in a minute of one um of<br>what's happening in terms of the entire<br>structure of this nerve Network that's<br>on the surface of your heart and so if<br>you focus through you can see all these<br>beautiful dots all of these synapses and<br>this is work done by Master student uh<br>Ben Prince together with Greg you can<br>see there's so many synapses happening<br>in these little brains so we're really<br>excited to figure out what are they<br>doing um and so that's just a still<br>photograph there of what we're zooming<br>through here on the movie and so some<br>current work that we're doing in<br>collaboration with stos stus over in<br>Oklahoma is trying to understand we've<br>got all these<br>synapses what kind of plasticity is<br>happening in them and are they involved<br>in therapy um Pathways so stos has done<br>some work in which she has shown that if<br>you stimulate the vagus nerve the nerve<br>that comes into the heart one of the<br>major nerves that comes into the heart<br>in a certain way you can decrease um the<br>occurrence of AF but we have no idea how<br>it's working and we really need to know<br>that to be able to better Target<br>therapies so what our prediction is that<br>this this stimulation is producing<br>plasticity at these synapses and that's<br>what's actually helping with this<br>therapy so kind of bring everything<br>together I've talked a lot about a lot<br>of different things but what it all<br>comes down to is the nuts and bolts of<br>how our synapses work and it doesn't<br>matter where they are be that in your<br>brain in different regions of your brain<br>in the ccka in the heart anywhere they<br>all undergo plasticity and so what we<br>know is that in sort of under normal<br>conditions synapses are really<br>complicated we know that lots of things<br>happening on the speaking side of the<br>neuron lots of things happening on the<br>receiving side of the neuron but what<br>happens when things go wrong in<br>different diseases is that so many of<br>these processes get altered and so what<br>we need to try and figure out is how to<br>stop that and move it back to when they<br>were working properly and we really the<br>major focus of my lab is using<br>plasticity to do that basically using<br>the skills that neurons have themselves<br>to change their synapses and drive it so<br>that they can change back and hopefully<br>that then you know sort of basically<br>advances to a reversal of different<br>Behavioral or clinical<br>phenotypes and just to finish off<br>because this is something I'm incredibly<br>passionate about um is some work that<br>I've been uh leading um together with a<br>bunch of other amazing women looking at<br>the balance of wah heart health so in<br>case you weren't sober already some<br>sobering statistics is that you know<br>cardiovascular diseas is a leading cause<br>of death in woman but we don't hear<br>about it much at all it causes 35% of<br>deaths of<br>women um the problem is that in terms of<br>participation in clinical trials women<br>are really poorly and un and you know<br>under represented in clinical trials if<br>it's you're interested in I highly<br>recommend um this review in the lanet<br>and so as a result women are often<br>getting treated with drugs that were not<br>tested on women or very little women um<br>very few women um and so this talk this<br>review talks about how it's so important<br>to prioritize sex specific research<br>actually really doing research with<br>women not just on woman but with women<br>and so women are not men and I know<br>that's not surprised<br>um but you got kind of got to really<br>think about what that actually means um<br>and so what we are doing in this really<br>large integrated research module that's<br>through putahi manaa which is our Center<br>of research Excellence for heart health<br>is trying to look at what's happening<br>Across the Life Course of a woman<br>because we are not men we are very<br>different our physiology is pretty damn<br>cool but it's very varied and yet often<br>we have drugs for example or<br>Pharmaceuticals that were not tested you<br>know to basically Target women and so<br>for example an example of this is you<br>know women when they are<br>pregnant often if you or not often very<br>frequently if you have for example<br>cardiovascular issues with pregnancy um<br>such as preclampsia that significantly<br>increases your risk of cardiovascular<br>disease cardiovascular disease later in<br>life it's a huge risk factor but this is<br>only just coming to light now and so<br>it's really important to know because<br>obviously the mechanisms are there of<br>this disease very early on and are<br>basically coming out because of the<br>challenge with pregnancy and so what<br>we're doing in this integrated research<br>mod module is looking Across the Life<br>Course of a woman for example at<br>menopause as well where we have more<br>massive hormonal changes and trying to<br>understand what's actually going on and<br>what risk factors are happening and<br>importantly partnering with our<br>communities as I said before women are<br>so under represented in clinical trials<br>why is that how can we work with our<br>communities and partner with them as I<br>said before to do research with women<br>not on<br>woman and so I just want to do a few<br>acknowledgements um I don't know why I'm<br>so I promise I wouldn't lose it and now<br>I'm like<br>what I had no sleep last night it was<br>very tense night in MWI so I'll use that<br>as an excuse anyway I just want to thank<br>much oh my god um yeah my husband Tony<br>and our two boys um you really are my<br>home but also my Adventure um and I know<br>you've always got my<br>back and yeah things have been pretty<br>rough these last few months for us<br>so um I just want to say thank you so<br>much for everything you do for me um<br>also to my family here my parents my mom<br>and dad um God now going to go again our<br>dad passed away uh three years ago but<br>he would have been so proud to be here<br>tonight now I'm sitting my sister's<br>off um and yeah my beautiful sisters who<br>are all here tonight um a beautiful W<br>know you know I know why I am so<br>passionate about heart health okay let's<br>move on okay<br>so and to my beautiful lab um I've<br>worked with so many amazing people over<br>the years um and some of you will<br>probably kill me for showing these<br>photos but ywan loves to dress people<br>up um and so I had to include a<br>beautiful one of ywan but yeah some of<br>these people I've worked with for so<br>many years and it's just been such a<br>pleasure to do great science um with<br>with you all it really has been you know<br>a an honor and for supervising you know<br>many phds um and working together and<br>partnering and doing some great<br>science um also really want to thank the<br>people that I've collaborated with some<br>who I still very much so collaborate<br>with um especially Craig who I've worked<br>with for a number of years this is when<br>he was over in New Zealand and we went<br>snowboarding uh and the other the<br>beautiful way in our um integrative<br>research model module that we're working<br>together woman's heart<br>health and then finally um acknowledge<br>the funders um who have supported all my<br>research over the years um we always<br>have this at the end and thank the<br>funders but I feel like this is probably<br>the slide that reflects the most amount<br>of work it's a lot of work that goes<br>into um these grants but I'm very<br>thankful um and also proud to be have<br>been supported by so many funders over<br>the years to help my research um bring<br>my research dreams to life and so I'll<br>finish there thank you so much and I<br>now my hi<br>my peter Thor talk to no U my name is<br>Peter Thor and uh it's a real<br>pleasure uh to be here and to be invited<br>to thank you Joe for what was actually<br>has been the most wonderful presentation<br>uh an extraordinary journey I think<br>through um such a<br>diverse a diverse number different<br>different fields I mean it's<br>extraordinary what you've achieved and<br>also in a relatively short time when you<br>think of it two th no when you came here<br>what 2005 and I know there was a lot of<br>stuff before that but we actually only<br>here thank you about that<br>um I do think though that uh I just<br>noticed that U Maria's in the audience<br>so there might be a little bit of a<br>visit from health and safety to your lab<br>at some point in the future so you might<br>want to might want to check your your<br>liquid nitrogen<br>stocks so I've known Joe for uh a lot a<br>number of years since she came here in<br>2005 uh which was a was fantastic that<br>she arrived and brought so<br>many uh not just techniques um but just<br>so much enthusiasm uh for for<br>neuroscience and um came here and I had<br>the pleasure and of working with Joe uh<br>where we did some work on the cockle as<br>you pointed out and they were wonderful<br>years with uh with the work that we did<br>in the students and with Gary and um and<br>made some really fantastic um uh uh<br>discoveries from that work also enjoyed<br>working with you Joe through when we had<br>the Orland Neuroscience um uh Network<br>and that sort of became the center of<br>brain research and we worked together on<br>some committees in there and developing<br>that and then of course with brain<br>research new zal and uh those you've<br>you've made such a wonderful<br>contribution and um really appreciated<br>all that time we've we've done things<br>together so I could say that I've always<br>been rather in a of you actually Joe so<br>uh um and you're just really so capable<br>uh great at everything that you do and<br>we've seen some evidence of that tonight<br>um Joe's an outstanding<br>neurosciences who really is highly<br>regarded by her Neuroscience colleagues<br>um you really made some extraordinary<br>and very significant contributions in<br>the field of Neuroscience particularly<br>in CTIC bi biology the latest work that<br>you're talking about in the heart is uh<br>going to be another extraordinary<br>Discovery and U congratulations on all<br>that work and I want to say that uh<br>congratulating you but I know as you've<br>done tonight is just to thank all of the<br>people that you worked with and the<br>students in particular and so many<br>people who have contributed an enormous<br>amount of effort to to this work um you<br>have a very impressive National and<br>international um uh reputation as well<br>as as an Innovative scientist um a very<br>inquiring scientist you have a lot of uh<br>uh collaborators internationally we've<br>met some of them here when they've come<br>here um and uh and I know also that<br>you're so passionate about Neuroscience<br>that we saw tonight I feel a bit<br>exhausted actually just having listened<br>to it all<br>uh very supportive of early career<br>researchers as we we've seen uh<br>throughout and a wonderful Advocate uh<br>an inspiring role model for for women in<br>science um so thank you for that and<br>you're also an excellent teacher and and<br>student<br>supervisor but I thought I should just I<br>ran a little survey of our Neuroscience<br>colleagues just to find out if this was<br>all real you know I mean this is uh so<br>because I might just be a little bit<br>biased um so I just got a few comments<br>from people around the country so Joe is<br>held in high esteem by her colleagues in<br>basic and applied<br>neurosciences she has made significant<br>impact in the Continuum of basic to<br>apply to translational neuroscience and<br>we saw that beautifully tonight the<br>depth and breadth of her intellectual<br>curiosity and Endeavor points to her<br>creative and adaptive scientific<br>thinking again what we saw tonight<br>driven focused on the endold<br>enthusiastic in everything that she<br>does Joanna's leadership and drive for<br>the greater good of Neuroscience New<br>Zealand is<br>exemplary so we saw all these things<br>tonight on show and that lecture was a<br>Twitter Force I think it was<br>extraordinary to hear uh all of the the<br>extraordinary breadth of your research<br>the depth of the research um uh that you<br>don't even take a breath during during a<br>presentation like that is extraordinary<br>as well maybe you'll get into breathing<br>next time and find out what how that<br>happens um and I think the value that<br>you place on the translational aspects<br>of the science and the fundamental<br>research to solve some very important<br>clinical problems and questions uh is is<br>really important and I think the lecture<br>tonight just shows the extraordinary<br>repertoire of skills and and techniques<br>that you have and that you bring<br>together and your ability also to bring<br>teams together and hold those teams<br>together and Inspire them and encourage<br>them to do magnificent work um I think<br>too your presentation tonight just<br>highlighted durability to bring to life<br>complex Concepts and um and and ideas<br>and present them in a very simple and<br>understandable way and I think this just<br>um shows that you're not just an<br>outstanding scientist but also is these<br>are the essence of a great teacher and<br>uh and and I can see why um you're so<br>much loved by and respected by your<br>students so well<br>done I think too just a final Point um<br>you know recognize that you pointed out<br>that uh you're working comfortably<br>really across two centers of research<br>excellence<br>which don't really relate to each other<br>you know you've got was part of the<br>brain core as a leader in the brain core<br>um healthy brains now you're a leader in<br>the heartcore and uh and with healthy<br>healthy hearts and I think this points<br>to just your intellectual adaptability<br>and your diversity of of thinking and<br>skills so uh before closing I just<br>wanted to um acknowledge the challenges<br>that you and your family uh have had<br>over the last few months and um I know<br>that they've been very difficult for you<br>after cyclone and I just think we hope<br>that this event and all the support<br>that's here tonight uh just a little Ray<br>of of sunshine uh for a brief period to<br>to get you through these<br>times so uh there was an amazing lecture<br>and um I think you've left us all<br>impressed with you as a scientist a<br>teacher and as a person and we<br>congratulate you on um an well extremely<br>well-deserved promotion to professor and<br>in wishing you well for your future<br>research and academic roles we just want<br>to thank you for an inspiring<br>Joe so uh standing between you and a<br>drink is Kevin Dr Kevin Lee who's going<br>to give come down here and just a little<br>gift Joe and we have<br>a for your lecture well and um Kevin G<br>Professor uh thank you p thank you Bruce<br>and especially thank you to Joe one of<br>the criteria for reaching the state of<br>Professor uh is is uh not only<br>International Eminence but also evidence<br>of the ability to mentor and grow the<br>next future generation of academics but<br>also a reflection on your contributions<br>to teaching as well as research we heard<br>mostly about the research tonight but I<br>also want to acknowledge Joe's<br>contributions in those other areas which<br>made the decision to promote her to<br>Professor a relatively easy one so I<br>hope you've enjoyed the lecture I<br>certainly have as Peter says it was a<br>tour to force the enthusiasm that came<br>through was was very evident so I hope<br>you enjoyed the evening and please join<br>us outside for drinks and nibbles and<br>our next inaugural lecture<br>is next week same time same bat Channel<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
