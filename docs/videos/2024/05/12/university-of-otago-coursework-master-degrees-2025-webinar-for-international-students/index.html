of May we are<br>delighted to introduce you to our new<br>brand the first time uh the university<br>has um made any significant change to<br>its brand in over 155 years and as you<br>can see from our new logo here our name<br>Remains the Same University of Ito but<br>we're thrilled to have a beautiful new<br>Mali name OT<br>faku Waka which has a a metaphorical<br>meaning of a place of many firsts which<br>of course is a nod to the fact we are<br>indeed the first University of New<br>Zealand but in fact otaco or otago our<br>area of New Zealand is the first for<br>many things and you see here the<br>beautiful new gold tahu or symbol uh and<br>this icon absolutely is special to us<br>and our region it reflects the two-way<br>current of our otago or Oto Harbor which<br>has been a wonderful place of exchange<br>of knowledge two-way coming in and out<br>of our area as well as students and<br>others in and out of our part of the<br>country so we're really excited to<br>welcome you to uh otaka ihaka the<br>University of<br>otago all right we have a large agenda<br>to get through today and we're going to<br>hop straight in by kicking off with<br>welcoming you to New Zealand and a bit<br>about denan so New Zealand or Alo our<br>Mar name we are 5 million people we have<br>three official languages English of<br>course our Teri our indigenous language<br>and New Zealand sign language in terms<br>of our country and profile we're ranked<br>pretty highly among a number of global<br>indicators including the fact we're the<br>third least corrupt country in the world<br>the fourth safest country in the world<br>we're very good at gender equality we're<br>prosperous 11th happiest Sarah it's us<br>it's always good and we doing pretty<br>well in the sustainability<br>competitiveness rankings as well<br>something that's special to New Zealand<br>and you won't find it anywhere else uh<br>is indeed our M culture our indigenous<br>people and something that we really<br>Embrace are the M principles of manari<br>Tanga uh and this is referring to<br>hospitality kindness generosity and<br>support and it's something we value and<br>something we love to share with<br>International students now when you<br>consider studying in New Zealand you<br>have some great options all eight<br>universities in New Zealand are ranked<br>in the top 2% in the world we are uh<br>considered the number one<br>English-speaking Country For Preparing<br>students for the future which of course<br>is what it's all about uh we have<br>world-class education uh we certainly<br>focus on ideas of critical thinking<br>Hands-On learning working<br>collaboratively problem solving and<br>creativity and indeed problem solving is<br>something we're especially good at<br>training uh people in New Zealand is<br>considered the second best country in<br>the world for producing graduates with<br>problem solving skills there's great<br>research opportunities in our country<br>and New Zealand was the first country in<br>the world to adopt a special code of<br>practice to ensure that we look after<br>International<br>students so Sarah you want to join in<br>with where are we I would love to so we<br>are located in the beautiful Harbor and<br>also coastal city of otot Da and so<br>again you can see the reflection over<br>new too symbol this is the atako harbor<br>that sits in front of you and a very<br>special part of the world so how would<br>you get to us if you're coming from um<br>anywhere whether it's Australia or Asia<br>or Europe or the US um or Africa you<br>would probably enter through our two<br>main ports which would be Oakland or<br>Christ Church sometimes you can come<br>through Wellington through Australia um<br>and there's also Queenstown if you're<br>coming from Australia but from the two<br>main ports is a small flight down to our<br>beautiful part of the country so why<br>would you think about coming to denan<br>you may recognize from my accent not<br>originally from here migrated in 1999<br>and Incredibly proud to promote New<br>Zealand and also our beautiful city we<br>are very much a student city um we have<br>been for the<br>last5 years and it's what makes our City<br>Vibe amazing we have a population of<br>131,000 and as you can see 25,000 of<br>those are students so you are going to<br>be in a vibrant student City where<br>learning is key we love it we're all<br>proof of that this is why we're in the<br>room and we hope you would love it too<br>um as well as you are going to learn<br>from the brightest because we do have<br>the highest concentration of<br>postgraduate qualifications in ATO in<br>New Zealand um we're also being as a<br>smaller City we're more affordable than<br>the key City ities um so a great<br>selection of accommodation that you can<br>choose from and why we love it so much<br>we have a fantastic lifestyle it is so<br>easy to get around our city 10 to 15<br>minutes no big traffic jams like a lot<br>of some of the larger cities and we get<br>to visit in the world and a fantastic<br>mix of everything from nature culture<br>sport key difference of um New Zealand<br>in comparison to maybe a few of you<br>dialing in today from other parts of the<br>world as we have four real distinct<br>seasons and changeable weather so we<br>have a beautiful spring a summer an<br>Autumn and we are just about to move<br>into winter which I'm going to touch on<br>now so originally being from Scotland<br>you will see snow in that photograph it<br>only snows maybe one two three times a<br>winter um as we are coastal pause of<br>great excitement because most of our<br>students who study with us may not have<br>seen snow before so everybody gets<br>excited she usually gone by lunchtime<br>and sadly we'd love to have more<br>snowball fights and but in comparison to<br>say in North America Canada or Europe<br>where I'm from it isn't that cold so as<br>you know we're a student city um I<br>talked about us being very easy to get<br>around as you can see in this image here<br>to the right hand side is where the<br>university and campus is and it is a 15<br>to 20 minute drive to our beautiful full<br>City Beach um Peak traffic that might<br>hit 25 minutes so you can see how easy<br>it is to get around um bit of our<br>vibrant um city life because we have so<br>many students here from all over the<br>world as well as from all over New<br>Zealand and also Australia and you can<br>see chat time there for all of our Asian<br>students dialing in you'll be happy to<br>know Bubble Tea in the city and on<br>campus huge range of selection of IRAs<br>retail Etc so there's something in our<br>small City<br>but we also are on the doorstep to some<br>of the most beautiful landscapes I have<br>to say in the world Queenstown 3 and a<br>half hours away we've got a phenomenal M<br>Harbor cycopath now amazing scenery you<br>can get to explore if you enjoy the<br>outdoors or you've never seen snow try<br>some skiing or snowboarding three and a<br>half hours away get out<br>kayaking and you can also do some<br>Mountain hiking or I could introduce you<br>to her first word TR P which is hiking<br>in New Zealand um so it's three and a<br>half hour driveway to these phenomenal<br>places a great peace to rest and relax<br>and Sarah hot off the press New Zealand<br>has just been voted as the most<br>beautiful country in the world uh by one<br>of the major travel uh Rough Guide<br>happened yesterday there we go H off the<br>priest just for you okay let's now talk<br>about um a little bit more about the<br>University of atago and why you may wish<br>to consider us for studies so we are<br>indeed New Zealand's first and oldest<br>university we're ranked in the top 1% of<br>universities worldwide uh and here at<br>atago you can genuinely be taught by<br>some of the top teaching teaching<br>academics in the country uh as well as<br>experience a university that's been<br>ranked as New Zealand's top Institute<br>for educational performance we have<br>around 21,000 students uh over 2 and a<br>half th000 International students coming<br>from over 90 countries which is a great<br>diversity and we have a huge extensive<br>range of study options for you what's<br>really important are graduate outcomes<br>and ataro ranks very well here 95% of<br>graduates go directly into employment or<br>further study where ranked also have the<br>five star seal of approval from Qs<br>what's special about ataro is we're the<br>only truly residential University in the<br>country frankly across oceanana<br>86% of our students are not actually<br>from the city of denan so they move from<br>all around New Zealand uh from ockland<br>and Wellington Etc everyone's moving to<br>study at Oto as well as from across the<br>globe it's a very special campus<br>something you won't find anywhere else<br>uh with a mixture of new students no one<br>knows anyone we're all new to the city<br>and we create an environment to support<br>that we have over 150 I think it's 170<br>clubs in societies very high student<br>satisfaction and a great campus<br>environment where you feel safe secure<br>uh and supported one of my favorite<br>rankings is that we are considered the<br>fifth most beautiful campus in the whole<br>world which was quite an exciting uh uh<br>ranking um but whatever the the point is<br>this campus is stunning there is nothing<br>like it in the country you really will<br>feel uh that you're somewhere special<br>when you arrive here now speaking of<br>rankings academic rankings are important<br>for many of us in considering different<br>study uh destinations at atago we are<br>proud to have a number of subject areas<br>and ranked extremely highly in the world<br>uh and in fact we're the only New<br>Zealand University with a subject ranked<br>in the top 20 in the world that is our<br>sports related Sciences ranked 12th in<br>the world uh along with other topics<br>such as Dentistry tourism Anatomy uh MBA<br>fantastic but as you can see as we move<br>across the page there gosh what a spread<br>and diversity of subjects that reflects<br>the depth and uh breadth of teaching and<br>academic Excellence at o<br>tago okay so we're going to kick off<br>into coursework master's degrees at a<br>Tagle so we just wanted to highlight um<br>where we sit and what options are<br>available to you um and when you're<br>looking at NC<br>ncqa levels so a postgraduate diploma is<br>one year that's a level eight and just<br>um tying that in with currently what is<br>on offer is a one-year post study work<br>visa you would be eligible for when we<br>look at coursework and taught Masters um<br>our master's coursework by researcher<br>thesis or a research thesis Masters that<br>is classes in ended QA level 9 and that<br>will also mean you're eligible to apply<br>for a threeyear post study work visa we<br>aren't delving into PhD today that will<br>be a future web web inar but just so you<br>know that's also Ned QA level 8 and also<br>eligible for um a three-year post study<br>work<br>visa brilliant so let's now dig deeper<br>into the range of coursework Masters at<br>otago and we're going to kick start with<br>our business school Masters uh and you<br>can see here that at atago we are

special application processes<br>but man what a great program to consider<br>for those seeking an<br>MBA W now that was an exciting range of<br>business programs and I'd like to open<br>the floor up to Leah our um associate<br>Dean International from the business<br>school Leah something you'd like to add<br>in regards to your range of business<br>Masters sure I think the real strength<br>of the business school is our close<br>connections to the business community so<br>we really M make the most of those<br>connections to ensure that our research<br>and teaching are both really C current<br>um to the the local business environment<br>uh we also have passionate and active<br>research staff so we're actually the top<br>business school for research in New<br>Zealand uh and as Megan mentioned a<br>number of our individual programs are<br>also globally ranked our graduates are<br>also sought after by industry so 96% of<br>our graduates go directly into the<br>workforce or further study um and we<br>create lots of opportunities for<br>students and businesses to interact so<br>for example it might be through uh case<br>study competitions through<br>industry-based research projects and<br>through connections to the local startup<br>and entrepreneurial sector uh that was<br>mentioned brilliant thanks Leah okay<br>we're going to move our track into<br>Health Sciences and our uh excellent<br>coursework Masters that are offered from<br>here now the master of Public Health at<br>atago our Public Health academics are<br>are certainly World leading indeed we<br>have some superb epidemiologists very<br>involved in the covid response and<br>government advising of course from those<br>days let's just move along from there a<br>little bit but still highly active in<br>public policy and um health promotion<br>and we have a superb 2-year Public<br>Health Master what what's new for us is<br>you can now apply directly into the<br>2-year master program uh admission uh<br>requirement is uh uh any prior bachelor<br>degree um uh in the main uh and with a B<br>average now there are very good<br>employment opportunities for Public<br>Health Specialists and again you<br>couldn't um couldn't you could it it's<br>hard to find a better place in New<br>Zealand to consider studying Public<br>Health now whilst we do have campuses in<br>denan Christ Church and Wellington in<br>which we teach public health for a new<br>international student joining us we<br>strongly encourage you to join us on the<br>denan campus to gain a full spectrum of<br>support and to set you up for success<br>but certainly uh this is a strong<br>two-year public uh Health master and I<br>think one thing we um to mention onto<br>our public health is that we are one of<br>two medical schools in the country so<br>you really are getting taught by the<br>best of the best so we cover as Megan<br>mentioned um within medson from<br>Wellington Christ Church down to denan<br>and dened being the core of where our um<br>student support is absolutely now<br>another very exciting program is our<br>master of nursing science now this is<br>taught in our Christ Church campus and<br>only at our Christ Church campus what's<br>exciting about this program is it's not<br>designed for someone already in with a<br>nursing background it's actually a<br>professional opportunity for those with<br>a different type of bachelor degree from<br>any area<br>looking to move into nursing you've<br>discovered a new passion you want to<br>make an impact and this 2-year program<br>very intense clinically focused it's<br>your pathway to be a registered nurse in<br>New Zealand uh this program is also a<br>credited not only in New Zealand but in<br>the United States and it is taught from<br>one of the world's top 100 nursing<br>departments in our Christ Church campus<br>so you have a real mix of lectures<br>clinical uh skills development<br>simulation labs as well as clinical<br>placements huge demand for nursing<br>pretty much around the whole world but<br>specifically in New Zealand so this<br>program sets you up very well um now<br>there are limited places in this program<br>connected to the clinical placements and<br>this program does have an earlier<br>application deadline than some other<br>programs so please be aware of that uh<br>but a great program now for those of you<br>who already have a health uh academic<br>background may may indeed be working<br>professionally uh we do have a 2-year<br>master of Health Science in which you<br>can specialize or further enhance your<br>um particular passion uh and area of<br>expertise uh a range of specializations<br>listed below But as Sarah said atago is<br>very much home to Health Sciences for<br>the country uh so really excellent<br>opportunities<br>there okay moving into Sciences so as<br>you can see from our University two<br>amazing divisions and we're going to<br>move into two more so master of science<br>this predominantly is a 2-year program<br>this is where you would have coursework<br>in year one and then you would either do<br>a thesis or a research project in year<br>to if you've already completed an honors<br>or PG dip then there could potentially<br>be the thesis option available for you<br>as well from this you can progress into<br>either PhD research or industry so we<br>have a huge range of study options<br>available in our master of science all<br>of them again your taught by World<br>leading academic staff and I cannot<br>highlight that enough and we're lucky<br>enough to be amongst it and sometimes we<br>forget how fantastic they are and how<br>much research they do not just within<br>New Zealand but also globally so most<br>endorsements will be available in either<br>semester one which is February or a July<br>intake again into admission we're<br>looking at the equivalent of b or 70%<br>and above and qualifications or<br>experience so you will have to have a<br>related field in this in your<br>undergraduate study to continue on into<br>your Master's and for most departments<br>supervision will be required before<br>applying so please if you've seen<br>something on the screen that catches<br>your eye um go on to our departmental<br>website and they will tell you how you<br>can apply for the master of science and<br>how to go about getting that supervision<br>so check that out on our<br>website okay so now we're going to talk<br>about our master of Applied signs so<br>these are more of a top coursework<br>Masters anything between 12 to 18 months<br>in duration again dependent on subject<br>so you can see the endorsements that we<br>have and also a very strong range and a<br>lot of those programs are again in those<br>really high demand areas within New<br>Zealand at the moment so this is very<br>much looking if you're looking to<br>upskill for a better career path um if<br>you would prefer to go onto that<br>academic side and you're looking at PhD<br>then you'd be looking at a research<br>based project so again majority of these<br>um are available both semester 1 which<br>is our February start again and just a<br>reminder semester 2 is July um also B um<br>and above some of those will accept<br>alternative qualifications and<br>experience as well and um as we are<br>lucky enough to have Miranda in the room<br>with us today from food science we're<br>going to touch a little bit on that um<br>later on um because it's further down<br>the track but she is one of those<br>programs you can come from a um<br>different background so touching on<br>probably one of the questions I am<br>fortunate enough to travel to parts of<br>the world and maybe I've met with some<br>of you in Market artificial intelligence<br>and it's<br>everywhere it doesn't matter what area<br>you're wanting to move in into this<br>again is a very high demand Global one<br>you can start this um either both<br>semesters and you do not necessarily<br>have to have a background in AI if<br>you're looking for a July start you've<br>got three different outcomes on this<br>whether you want to take a project<br>commercialization you do independent<br>study or a workplace project software<br>engineering again very high demand for<br>and this globally same um sort of three<br>Pathways that you can choose on this and<br>again um it would be a b coming into<br>that one moving on into computer science<br>again lots of different topics that you<br>can focus on here um we know um students<br>coming into this you will um look at<br>preferably it's great if you do have<br>practical experience if you don't have a<br>relevant bachelor's degree so again this<br>will be assessed on your<br>application now we've touched on being<br>very strong in Health Sciences<br>bioengineering is one of the top five<br>Global in New Zealand for Innovation<br>potential in biotechnology it's our<br>biggest growth field in the tech sector<br>is Health Tech so this is where this<br>program is excellent lots of amazing<br>focus on um biomaterials nanom medicine<br>and<br>diagnostic again options for coursework<br>into supervis independent study and you<br>need a b um average to get into<br>that but not so within that sort of<br>Health size size space is our Advanced<br>Nutrition practice and looking for<br>students who wanted to develop those<br>nutrition skills you've got a compulsory<br>and practice-based project in this<br>program with the Public Health<br>Organization so you can see where a lot<br>of our degrees cross science into health<br>science or can be multi-m divisional as<br>well and that is also the beauty of a<br>Tagle because you're getting um academic<br>staff from multi-disciplines feeding<br>into so many different fantastic areas<br>again looking at a B and backgrounds<br>human nutrition sport exercise nutrition<br>or related health field Environmental<br>Management this again great career<br>opportunities in New Zealand but also<br>globally we know the world is changing<br>this is a fantastic way that you can<br>make a difference so looking at<br>Environmental Management again gives you<br>the focus areas and look and it's a b or<br>70% in De admission preferably relevant<br>practical experience can also be<br>considered if you do not have a relevant<br>bachelor degree so again excellent<br>career outcomes with this degree and now<br>we're talking about food science so the<br>master of applied science and food and<br>agriculture this is a huge and a very<br>exciting new program for us food is a<br>big part of again what the world needs<br>and how do we feed our population and<br>all the different parts that can be part<br>of that so and we also have a master of<br>science and food science so I'm going to<br>pass over to the expert now and who can<br>talk a little bit more about why that is<br>so awesome to study at a tarle yeah<br>thank you um so we've got a really<br>strong academic program and it's taught<br>by some of the real leaders in in this<br>field um it's it's quite a holistic<br>program as a name implies so we we<br>really take this sort of f to Fork<br>approach<br>uh which means it's an interdisciplinary<br>program we've got a really strong focus<br>on on future Foods on<br>sustainability uh is a relatively small<br>cohorts of students which is fantastic<br>because we can of get in and do lots of<br>practical Hands-On learning lots of<br>field trips um we use what we call a<br>flipped learning technique so we we we<br>deliver content um before class and then<br>come into class and it's really<br>interactive and it's it's quite a global<br>uh program food is global and and and<br>our uh students sort of student cohort<br>reflects that so we've got students from<br>all over the world uh studying with us<br>which which brings great<br>diversity um and there are jobs there<br>are so many jobs there is a national<br>shortage uh of food scientists and a<br>global shortage of food scientists so<br>our graduates are are snapped up um<br>often before they graduate and and our<br>staff are really sort of well connected<br>with industry and are able to help<br>facilitate uh this move into employment<br>so it's not just sort of great jobs with<br>good pay but it's you know you sort of<br>alluded to food is really important and<br>and you know a lot of the um sort of<br>issues that we're facing these big<br>Global issues of our time and climate<br>change and obesity and things like this<br>um you know coming through our programs<br>is and and going out into work in these<br>sectors is a really good way to be able<br>to make an impact to some of these these<br>big issues that we Face fantastic thank<br>you think I need to study fit science<br>yeah<br>feel okay um and coming up we also have<br>molecular<br>biotechnology again taught by world<br>class academics and this is very much<br>designed for students looking who've got<br>an interest in genetics biochim<br>microbiology how do we create new<br>treatments for diseases looking at<br>genetic traits or you could be looking<br>at solving crimes through forensic<br>techniques so again really fantastic<br>opportunity to make an impact and we<br>also have our plant biotechnology as<br>well so great and there's more<br>quantitive genetics we on so many so<br>quantitive genetics 12 to 18 month<br>program again great career opportunities<br>and due to shortage of workers and I<br>know we are seeing increasing demand in<br>our bachelor's programs moving into<br>genetics too so great to see that word<br>getting out there and another top<br>Department another top Department 12th<br>in the world and if any of you who are<br>um online today know New Zealand loves<br>Sport and we're big sporting Nation we<br>have a phenomenal master of sport and<br>development management it is the only<br>Sport and development Management program<br>in New Zealand the facilities here are<br>world class and I cannot emphasize that<br>enough and we're lucky enough to um we<br>have a flume if any of you aware what a<br>flume is if not Google it look it up on<br>our website where conditions can be<br>recreated and we have access to Great<br>sporting um companies as well as<br>organizations so again great one to<br>consider and you have a compulsory<br>practicum where you're out there in<br>Industry among those organizations<br>getting exposure to New Zealand's for<br>this is a great program for social<br>science backgrounds in particular too so<br>really extensive range gosh a couple<br>more to go s oh well you saw penguins on<br>our slides about denan personal favorite<br>of mine so I can't go past the master of<br>wildlife management um anybody who<br>enjoys the outdoors and helping nature<br>this is phenomenal as you saw we are a<br>base to get out and explore some of the<br>most beautiful parts of the world<br>whether it's from Furs to rainforests um<br>or looking at Landscapes more by our<br>agricultural for this you do need a<br>bachelor's degree in science zoology<br>biology or ecology but it is a<br>phenomenal program and then last but not<br>least I think on this one is our master<br>of surveying we are the only surveying<br>School in New Zealand again great career<br>opportunities due to a shortage of<br>workers in this um you will require a<br>bachelor's degree of surveying to go<br>into this one but again your study<br>options it's up toate it's relevant<br>you're looking at GIS you're looking at<br>IAL databases and web mapping really<br>really really good career opportunities<br>New Zealand and<br>globally well science s all that science<br>I think we're the most science intensive<br>University in the country so without<br>doubt strong academics strong facilities<br>and a beautiful place to do sciences all<br>right we now shift track into the<br>humanities and really excited to present<br>or touch on our master of arts a 2year<br>uh sorry what am I saying 12 to 18<br>months program uh and what's exciting<br>with our master of arts Sago is look at<br>the range of specializations that you<br>can pursue for 25 and onward uh and in<br>particular the fact that we uh we now<br>offer a master Arts that's purely<br>coursework 100% taught um or there is of<br>course the opport opportunity for<br>coursework with a a smaller dissertation<br>um now rather than me talking about this<br>I'm really excited to uh welcome back<br>into the panel Rosie from the humanities<br>uh Rosie would you like to share a<br>little more about this opportunity yeah<br>I'd be delighted Megan it's really great<br>uh to be here and I just want to um<br>emphasize the great thing about<br>Humanities is we offer those human<br>skills which are really needed in every<br>industry in the world this is the idea<br>of perhaps building your criticality<br>your creativity and even your<br>communication skills um to I guess add<br>that kind of nuance to many jobs and<br>careers so um the master of arts<br>Humanities as you can see there in the<br>box covers a real range of uh<br>disciplines from both the Arts or<br>Humanities as well as uh the social<br>sciences the great thing about uh the<br>master of arts coursework is its breadth<br>and<br>interdisciplinarity there's a diverse<br>and energetic intellectual environment<br>with lots of international students and<br>you can really um you can do this the<br>breadth of the degree but also you get<br>the chance to specialize particularly if<br>you pick the dissertation option so you<br>could pick to do your dissertation in<br>politics philosophy Media or coms or any<br>of those um options there we also have a<br>really Lively Humanities internship<br>program um which can lead to um uh or<br>definitely skills you up with those<br>Hands-On um experiences building<br>capacity for employment in um Industries<br>such as the creative Industries which is<br>things like advertising journalism and<br>film uh the film production industry as<br>well as gallery libraries and museums<br>and of course the public service um so<br>that's a really exciting uh thing as<br>well but I did just want to Echo that<br>we've got this new option for 2025 which<br>is the 100% taught only uh pathway as<br>well that's been a lot of a lot of<br>demand for people uh in that space so<br>really exciting and again look at that<br>range of specializations for you um<br>thanks Rosie uh okay now we also have<br>additional uh Humanities coursework<br>Master options including our very po<br>one-year master of teaching and learning<br>this is a teaching degree for those of<br>you with a bachelor degree uh you're<br>able to UPS School gain a teaching<br>degree that leads to uh registration in<br>New Zealand man our College of Education<br>is strong it is our College of Education<br>that has developed curriculum used<br>worldwide uh they really know their<br>stuff and boy do they train student uh<br>teachers very well they really take<br>great care of you uh and they welcome<br>International students into this program<br>um um there are limited places in the<br>program so it's important you apply<br>during the application period period<br>that has opened and will shut at the end<br>of July uh but gosh if you get into this<br>program there is a a need for teachers<br>uh we have a shortage particularly at<br>the secondary school level uh and I can<br>really strongly assure you that our<br>College of Education really look after<br>you as an international student uh and<br>give you a great experience that will<br>set you up for teaching in New Zealand<br>we also have a super master of social<br>and Community work it's an applied<br>program it takes about between 12 to 18<br>months um now for this you should of<br>course have a bachelor degree in a<br>relevant field um and this um indeed<br>does allow you to gain uh registration<br>to work as a social worker in New<br>Zealand as well um but please also note<br>the higher English language requirement<br>for entry into this particular program<br>we move into our masters of<br>International Development and planning<br>uh really fascinating area and open to<br>students from a range of bachelor degree<br>prior backgrounds interdisciplinary<br>program here uh in only 12 months as<br>well we also have a master of planning<br>that's a 2-year program it is accredited<br>by the New Zealand planning Institute uh<br>and um this one is due to open up for<br>applications a little later this year<br>it's not quite open at the moment and<br>there are limited spaces but just<br>comparing back to the master of<br>International Development and planning<br>um this is open to all uh prior<br>backgrounds and and a really fabulous uh<br>program for those with an interest in<br>indigenous studies we have a very well<br>recognized master program in this space<br>uh and of course increasingly not only<br>in New Zealand but globally uh there's<br>significant value and importance in<br>students with uh qualifications and<br>being able to lead in this space so um<br>another top program we have our master<br>of international studies open again to<br>all prior Bachelor degrees and actually<br>taught interdisciplinary with academics<br>from politics from economics from<br>international law um and indeed peace<br>and conflict studies too so that's a<br>cracker program um again open to all<br>prior Bachelor degrees now ataro has a<br>long and proud history of um uh peace<br>and conflict in fact we've had the<br>national peace and conflict research um<br>expertise here at ataro and and uh we're<br>delighted to um uh offer you the master<br>of peace and conflict studies for 25 uh<br>it is Jude to open up for applications a<br>little later this year what's exciting<br>about ataro program is it takes the lens<br>and perspective of both not only<br>International but indigenous um<br>approaches into addressing peace and<br>conflict issues really excellent um an<br>exciting area and some super academic<br>research um super research is doing<br>great work there<br>uh master of politics uh we have some<br>fabulous academics uh and I I now of<br>course I've just forgot on the name as I<br>look at you but often called upon to<br>comment on global<br>issues thank you very much listen to him<br>on the radio<br>often uh but a wonderful program for<br>those of you who do have um more of a<br>politics or related background to<br>progress and uh challenge yourself into<br>the Master Level really great all right<br>there a lot of programs we've covered<br>today and some of you might be feeling<br>overwhelmed and some of you might be<br>going holy moly there's so many cool<br>opportunities and it's helpful to know<br>which programs are actually open to you<br>no matter which bachelor degree you have<br>done um it's a chance for you to switch<br>career track uh or to um move your prior<br>studies into a different area or<br>expertise and and develop your career so<br>just highlighting a large number of<br>those business Masters were open to any<br>prior degree giving the opportunity to<br>upskill and move into the business World<br>also a number of other programs from<br>Health Sciences um and indeed in the uh<br>Humanities social sciences space uh and<br>actually Sports to some extent as well<br>so some some great options at atago so<br>there was a lot of content there was a<br>lot of content it I think for us it just<br>shows you the depth that we have here<br>across all of our divisions all amazing<br>Master's programs and a great choice to<br>choose but I think now we need to talk<br>to the academics who can give us some<br>more um detail of what it's actually<br>like to study here so we're going to<br>have it as an an open Panel and so let's<br>kick off with academic um<br>expectations um what would you like to<br>see and let's going to start with<br>business um what would you like to see<br>from a student coming into a tle I think<br>what we like to see is students that<br>bring their own knowledge their own<br>background so the the um classrooms at<br>Master's level are quite small so<br>between 15 and 25 students so it really<br>is very interactive it's usually a sort<br>of 2hour Workshop style um so yeah we we<br>love the international students and the<br>different perspectives that they bring<br>fantastic on to Humanities yeah um very<br>much a similar format we often have um<br>it's mostly seminar style uh learning<br>and again yes the breadth of your OPP um<br>your experience es and lives um is<br>really key here perhaps you want to I'm<br>supervising a thesis at the moment about<br>Chinese Cinema and audiences on hoop so<br>we've got uh this is really interesting<br>stuff you can bring your expertise and<br>uh specialize in and again they're very<br>small class sizes as<br>well and know you've already touched on<br>having quite a large International<br>cohort who comes into doing food science<br>what what what's the je<br>there well I think that the panelists<br>have sort of have mentioned that you<br>know we really respect and value the<br>experiences and and knowledge that you<br>bring uh to our programs and the sort of<br>the flavor that provides and um it's<br>it's a mix of both we also have<br>obviously you know domestic students in<br>our program and just just the<br>interaction and you know particularly<br>our subject area is food is is an<br>awesome way to to share uh share those<br>sort of cultural experiences and so<br>there's a lot of food involved in our<br>program food and why and bear<br>and now we're all pretty relaxed<br>together but how is it for the student<br>is it first name basis is it super<br>formal can you just rock on up and speak<br>to an academic how does it work so so<br>new zealanders or or kiwis as we're<br>often often called um are really<br>friendly and I think we we we've got<br>quite a sort of flat social structure<br>and so absolutely my students call me by<br>my first name um in fact we share a t-<br>room our staff and and our postgrad<br>students all share a t- room um with<br>with fantastic coffee machine and we we<br>sit together and and socialize uh both<br>you know in morning teas and<br>occasionally after work as well we're<br>knowing to go and have a drink with<br>students um so it is we've got a lovely<br>Dynamic um and just a really cool<br>culture yeah it's nice and what about<br>the balance of us seminars or lectures<br>and so forth versus self-study what's<br>that kind of ratio looking like uh in<br>Humanities we do expect quite a bit of<br>uh resilient independent study so that's<br>probably reading and taking notes and<br>things like that but also we have uh the<br>small seminars is the main uh way that<br>you'll be taught and of course if you if<br>you're doing a dissertation you get<br>one-on-one supervision with an expert in<br>the area who will really guide you uh<br>through putting together that uh<br>dissertation uh<br>thesis nice uh what about teaching<br>assistant jobs that often comes up uh<br>students cu to know if there's an<br>opportunity to get pick up some<br>part-time work which is uh if it's<br>permitted on their visa uh in order to<br>just support those funds a bit and<br>will'll get a bit of experience how does<br>that look for you Leah yeah for us we<br>definitely do have some of our<br>postgraduate students lecturing at the<br>undergraduate level um and that works<br>really well um it's nice to have that<br>similar age group and again bringing<br>those different cultural perspectives so<br>yes we do have that opportunity<br>fantastic yeah likewise there's<br>potential for um teaching into the<br>undergraduate programs yep great<br>particularly in tutor and demonstrator<br>type<br>roles right all right let's jump into<br>topic two there's been a lot of<br>terminology and language used today<br>regarding supervised independent study<br>or projects or dissertations or thesis<br>uh within some of the coursework Masters<br>can we get some panel members to help<br>clarify what is what and which is<br>which right maybe I can speak to<br>business so there are three options for<br>Masters you can be a fully coursework<br>master so that's taught only papers uh<br>or you can do what's called a project so<br>that is 40 points of independent<br>research and then the third option is a<br>60o dissertation so you would take this<br>option if you were thinking about the<br>potential for a PhD in the future um so<br>it's just that larger independent piece<br>of<br>research it's um in um Humanities it's<br>similar although we don't have uh we<br>we've we've just got the fully taught<br>version that's just been introduced so<br>you would do um a number of 60 point uh<br>30 point course coursework subjects in<br>your specialization but the dissertation<br>is very similar um in that uh that's a<br>60o research project of 20,000 Words<br>which you work on with a supervisor over<br>12 to 18 months and this is where you<br>really get to dig into your passion so<br>we've had um topics before such as<br>people um looking at um uh War widows<br>from uh World War II or as I said<br>Chinese film<br>industry um uh geography issues and<br>sustainability and you get to sort of do<br>perhaps a case study um where you really<br>do uh that independent research again<br>oneon-one uh Guided by your supervisor<br>as well<br>yeah and for us our projects are either<br>a a research project supervised like<br>you've just explained uh or an<br>internship with in with industry there<br>sort of the two options in you can<br>choose which you prefer depending on<br>yeah what you're interested in how you<br>degree all right okay actually we just a<br>question come through from one of our<br>webinar participants which is relevant<br>to what we're talking about so I just<br>thought we'd quickly ask so this is<br>about coursework Masters today but<br>they're thinking do they do a coursework<br>Masters or they do they do a research<br>Masters and what does that mean in terms<br>of career opportunities and potentially<br>um it for for us it it partly depends on<br>um which option you would choose would<br>depend on what you were coming in with<br>so which qualification you had so<br>because as as a our TCH master was a<br>flexible degree it's open to anyone with<br>any undergraduate degree so if you<br>didn't have an undergraduate degree in<br>food or or agriculture that would be the<br>only option available to you uh if you<br>did have an undergraduate degree in one<br>of those fields uh then the research<br>Masters would would be an option<br>um yeah and in terms of for us a a<br>taught Masters is one year uh and a<br>research Masters is uh a 2-year program<br>so it is a long as a commitment um<br>in terms of career outcomes it's quite<br>hard to comment really to comment on in<br>sort of general terms um obviously if<br>you're wanting to pursue a a career in<br>research in a you know perhaps in a<br>government agency or a research<br>institute or if you wanted to go on and<br>and stay in an Academia and a research<br>related role then the research Ro would<br>be the most um appropriate choice for<br>you uh it's also possible to to sort of<br>give both a go you can do the T Masters<br>for 12 months uh and then you can<br>progress on and do a one-year um<br>research Masters following that so<br>there's there's lots of options and in<br>fact you can it's not not our sort of<br>default route but you can go from our T<br>Masters if you do do a sry yeah from our<br>T Masters if you do do a research<br>project if you select that option and<br>you do well in that there is the um<br>opportunity to carry on and to do a PhD<br>as well so that was quite a complicated<br>answer I think the key point is if if<br>you you know you're welcome to contact<br>our department we can you know any any<br>of the Departments and we can talk you<br>through these you know through the<br>different options we've got lots of<br>flexibility to really build a program to<br>you know to to tailor what it is that<br>you're interested in fantastic brilliant<br>Now application process is always a big<br>important question for people and uh<br>that General concept of what's happening<br>at the department what requirements are<br>there from Department to get into these<br>taught Master programs and I think that<br>varies across the range of programs<br>we've talked about today um Rosie do you<br>want to comment for yeah um for the uh<br>if you choose the um ma uh master of<br>arts coursework T only pathway you you<br>can uh simply apply uh through the<br>application system and choose your<br>specialization if you're pursuing a<br>master of arts coursework where you want<br>to do the 20,000 word dis research<br>dissertation with a supervisor you need<br>to email a potential supervisor in the<br>program first so what you should do<br>there is check out the program website<br>say the sociology website and look at<br>those experts and researchers in the<br>field and find out who best would pick<br>suit your um dissertation topic I also<br>do have some alumni destinations on the<br>question of jobs I'm not sure of their<br>salary but we've um just to that last<br>point but we've um got 100% of our grad<br>have found employment and many of those<br>are in the public service either at<br>local or national level in aloa New<br>Zealand and in Canada but also in<br>journalism in uh magazines like your<br>home and garden in ITV which is a free<br>to a channel in uh the UK and also in<br>Consulting roles at places like price<br>Waterhouse Coopers as as well um so yeah<br>there's lots of um opportunities for<br>employment brilliant what about getting<br>into the program at uh business in terms<br>of requirements from the Department Leah<br>so fortunately it is quite a simple<br>process for the business school so you<br>can make an application directly uh and<br>as we said for most or for all subjects<br>that to be and usually that's open to<br>any discipline or any background with a<br>few exceptions for example finance and<br>economics uh but yes you can apply<br>directly even if you want to do either<br>the project or the dissertation you<br>don't need to approach a supervisor<br>beforehand so you can still enter the<br>program and then we work with you uh as<br>you're doing your papers to to think<br>about your topic and who that might<br>align with in terms of supervision<br>brilliant and for you Miranda uh we're<br>the same really simple just apply uh<br>once you here then we then we work out<br>the logistics of of Supervisors and so<br>forth so really simple process so more<br>broadly speaking when applying to a taro<br>for a coursework master the first step<br>is of course to double check the entry<br>requirement for the program of interest<br>uh that you have any pet special<br>application deadlines um and secondly<br>whether or not supervision is a<br>requirement for your application so it<br>applies to some particularly the some of<br>the Sciences or quite a few of the<br>coursework the two-year kind of re uh<br>Sciences um a handful of other programs<br>depending on the nature of the structure<br>of the program um but many programs<br>don't require that and that makes it<br>nice and easy then of course you'll move<br>on you want to select that program off<br>our website click apply when it's open<br>uh and uh set up your application and<br>what we call evision it's our the name<br>of our application and student<br>Administration system uh and you'll<br>upload all your official documents uh as<br>as required there and uh then you'll<br>submit that application and we always<br>highlight this part because it's easy to<br>put everything in and then just kind of<br>not ever click submit and then it's just<br>sitting there and no one's ever going to<br>see it so make sure you click submit and<br>that will fire off into the admissions<br>um Department who will then be able to<br>assess and in many cases assess and make<br>an offer directly and in some cases<br>assessed for eligibility uh and then<br>head out to the department for a final<br>approval and back<br>again now it's worth noting New<br>Zealand's Academic Year a little bit<br>different depending on where you are<br>based today so semester 1 is our main<br>academic start of the Year this is<br>February uh and you get a sense for when<br>you should be arriving to start studies<br>um we have a small midyear break around<br>early uh late June after exams and then<br>we kick on into semester 2 which is July<br>and so for New Zealand semester 1<br>February is Summer and semester 2 is<br>kind of our wintery days the snowman's a<br>bit misleading it's really not possible<br>to make a snowman in most cases we just<br>pop that one in for fun so some key<br>dates for you to make a note of the main<br>application round for all studies<br>starting in February next year is<br>actually open now for most programs and<br>in the main we close around about 15th<br>of November but as you might have picked<br>up today a few programs have different<br>application deadlines and this year a<br>few programs are opening a little bit<br>later uh so we just outline outline that<br>there so for instance we can apply for<br>masters of sustainable business today um<br>some of our other New U Master uh Master<br>business specializations like leadership<br>and management that's like we expect<br>that to open up around late June early<br>July um so the full range of business<br>programs certainly available around that<br>late June early July don't forget the<br>master of teaching and

assessed as part of<br>your general admission<br>application now some of you may be in<br>the market for a full scholarship but<br>you are un able to fund yourself for<br>living costs and and full tuition and<br>there are some options there is the very<br>prestigious New Zealand monarchi<br>scholarship um this is funded by our New<br>Zealand government and it is a full<br>scholarship clearly these are going to<br>be highly competitive and as such there<br>is a very specific application period in<br>February each year uh so that you can<br>perhaps start to plan and prepare and<br>consider an option for applying next<br>February which would be for a<br>scholarship that would apply for 26<br>studies so just flagging that one very<br>generous and prestigious and maybe there<br>are some other funding opportunities in<br>your country<br>too okay we've talked about academic<br>support but what about non-academic<br>support at a Targo we've got a huge<br>extensive range of services ranging from<br>specialized international student<br>support Visa support our fantastic<br>disability information and support team<br>uh academic um sort of Student Learning<br>and Development our

students outside of the<br>classroom as well um lots of great<br>things going on there but a really key<br>topic particularly when considering<br>postgraduate study uh careers and<br>networking opportunities we'd love to<br>talk a little bit more about<br>that yes so with career you've already<br>heard from the academic staff of where<br>Career Connections come in with<br>academics but there's a whole host of<br>other ways that you can start your<br>journey if you're looking to um continue<br>continue working in New Zealand um for<br>on your work post study work visa cannot<br>recommend a career development center<br>highly enough anybody who is considering<br>a 12month um Masters please see them<br>early in the start of your um time in<br>adago they can help you learn about New<br>Zealand how to write your resume for um<br>New Zealand employers what are New<br>Zealand employers looking for it could<br>be very different to your home country<br>so please see them early we've got a<br>fantastic team there that can help you<br>and there's a match program there's a<br>whole load of opportunities there for<br>you and as we already previously touched<br>on you can work part-time when you're<br>studying and again your most important<br>thing when you come to a Tagle is your<br>study so we always advise that you make<br>sure you balance your study before you<br>start looking for part-time work and you<br>can work full time during your holidays<br>and and then you've got the<br>eligibility there is a host of demand<br>career opportunities that'll align<br>across the spectrum of our master's<br>programs we've already touched on that<br>but this is a quick highlight bear and<br>handy Han know we've got a another<br>webinar coming up focused on internship<br>and career opportunities so that might<br>be a good one to Mark in your calendar<br>and join in with now just last couple of<br>quick topics um accommodation and and<br>costs um at aago for our postgrad<br>students you are able to apply for our<br>uni flats this is a very unique uh<br>student offering it gives you the chance<br>to to cive with other students and have<br>a true AO flatting experience uh and we<br>do have some options that we try to<br>cater for families if that's a situation<br>uh or some individual postgrads but<br>normally we try to put our coursework<br>talk Master students a little bit more<br>together um and of course there's always<br>a private accommodation option if you<br>wish to explore that too um so in terms<br>of costs tuition fees absolutely vary<br>depending on the particular program so a<br>t Masters can range anywhere from around<br>44,000 New Zealand per year to uh more<br>toward that 69,000 per year depending on<br>the specialization uh whether there's<br>lab equipment uh or the specialization<br>kind of the structure of the program<br>cost of living wise we strongly<br>recommend you plan and prepare for<br>around about $25,000 New Zealand dollars<br>a year immigration New Zealand has a<br>requirement uh but this is what we<br>recommend to make sure you're<br>comfortable and able to um to be good<br>here to go well so we know we're we're<br>pretty much over our five I guess one<br>thing just to touch on too the majority<br>of our accommodation that students will<br>live in when it's a UNIF flat 5 to 15<br>minute walk to campus you will have time<br>for your studies and extracurricular<br>activities and that is the beauty of a<br>Tagle some of our post-graduate students<br>who will be in private accommodation<br>could be a little bit further out but<br>again we're a small compact City and<br>again that gives you that time to study<br>plan interact with your academic staff<br>so a great City to to be a student in I<br>think that's right and often people<br>think only of big cities especially when<br>they're considering business but here's<br>a reality and that is why don't make<br>life easy while you study in a small<br>compact convenient location where<br>everything's walkable and we have great<br>connections into the uh entrepreneurial<br>Arena guest lectures coming in from<br>business and then you can get scooped up<br>and move on to whichever destination you<br>need for your employment but it's a<br>really beautiful place to come and study<br>so we're just going to quickly run<br>through some of the q&amp;as that came<br>through on our webinar so thank you to<br>the participants who pop those into um<br>the chat box today it's lovely to know<br>that you're watching and you're curious<br>about subing at a Tagle so number one I<br>will be studying for my first master's<br>degree at Tagle but this will be my<br>second master's degree am I eligible for<br>the vice Chancellor International<br>postgraduate scholarship uh certainly my<br>understand is that you are so long as<br>you have at least a minimum B+ average<br>in your prior degree the scholarship is<br>about welcoming and supporting<br>International students to join us in our<br>taught Masters full-time studies so um<br>it's my understanding that yes that<br>would be the case so for and the<br>academic staff does a student need to<br>gain work experience before applying for<br>a master's degree or can they progress<br>immediately from their<br>bachelor no previous experience required<br>yeah correct same with Humanity is<br>master of arts good and same for<br>business except for the NBA which does<br>require a background in industry and if<br>you don't have that we've got the<br>perfect new Masters in leadership and<br>management perfect for no experience<br>okay how to convert my GPA into anle be<br>that's always a bit tricky but frankly<br>don't stress about it because our<br>admission staff will help with that so<br>if you're worried about us um checking<br>that kind of detail our admission staff<br>have the expertise to do that and uh in<br>addition and same thing with those<br>scholarships they assess for your<br>eligibility at the time of assessing<br>your<br>application okay and then we're just<br>going to finish off with the last one<br>because we are over time master's degree<br>in Business analytics professional<br>accounting economics any of the course<br>available in the next<br>intake yes absolutely all three uh and<br>indeed certainly
