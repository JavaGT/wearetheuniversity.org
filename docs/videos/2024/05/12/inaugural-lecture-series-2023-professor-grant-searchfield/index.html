our<br>inaugural lecture series for<br>2023 for those in the audience<br>unfamiliar with<br>Academia let me explain a little bit<br>about the<br>ceremony and why it's so important to us<br>inauguration of a new professor is a<br>public<br>event recognizes the Ascension of one of<br>its members to the highest academic rank<br>the mark of Distinction often reflects<br>many decades of work in teaching<br>research and<br>service the in lecture serves firstly as<br>a way for colleagues to congratulate and<br>welcome a new professor on joining the<br>elite circle of the university<br>professorate and secondly to showcase<br>the subject of the new professor above<br>all it's a fun<br>evening inauguration is is celebrated by<br>universities around the world it's an<br>ancient ceremony dating back to time<br>when universities were small Elite clubs<br>and new members were paraded in front of<br>Rich benefactors to ensure their Contin<br>continued<br>patronage the term Professor comes from<br>the old French word<br>prophesier which itself is rooted in the<br>Latin professor in ancient Rome this was<br>a person who professes to be an expert<br>in some art or science or a teacher of<br>highest rank inaugural lectures are<br>great fun and a wonderful opportunity to<br>learn a little bit about the inaugural<br>professor's Journey the mentors who have<br>shaped their career their thinking and<br>simply to share in this academic success<br>tonight is our second inaugural lecture<br>for 2023 and will be delivered by<br>Professor Grant searchfield from the<br>discipline of Audiology in the school of<br>population health I firstly would like<br>to offer my warmest personal<br>congratulations to Grant and now ask<br>Professor Peter Thorne to formerly<br>introduce Professor searchfield the<br>lecture's conclusion associate professor<br>Judith mcll head of the school of<br>population health will offer some<br>closing remarks thank you Peter<br>now my high my ten Koto Teno<br>tenot cor Peter Thor to um my name is<br>Peter Thor is John introduce me and it's<br>a real pleasure to be here today to<br>introduce to introduce Grant um I'd like<br>to extend my own warm welcome to<br>everybody tonight to this uh to this<br>really special occasion and especially<br>to um send a warm welcome to um Grant's<br>family to his mother Pam I'm just trying<br>to find where she's yep oh there up<br>there and uh and met his mother-in-law<br>Marilyn and to Leslie and uh um Daisy<br>and and Leia uh it's lovely to have you<br>here today to share this<br>occasion uh it's also an enormous<br>pleasure for me to be able to introduce<br>to introduce Grant I've known him since<br>he was uh just a little fell uh when he<br>joined us in in Audiology we set the<br>program up and um uh and I had the real<br>pleasure of uh we've been very close<br>colleagues since then and and it's been<br>wonderful but also uh I had the pleasure<br>of supervising Grant with his P for his<br>PhD along with Suzanne pie and it's um<br>it's wonderful to see to be here<br>standing here today introducing you uh<br>as we honor you for reaching the level<br>of professor at the University so it's<br>it's wonderful to be able to do that<br>very<br>special<br>um I suppose just to give you a little<br>bit of a a brief introduction to Grant's<br>academic career because I'm supposed to<br>do that and say a few words about that<br>side of it but uh Grant received his BC<br>in Psychology from the University of<br>Oakland uh and then went on and did a<br>master of Audiology and Ted that with<br>first class honors in two in<br>1994 after a brief period as a clinical<br>audiologist both in public and private<br>practice uh he returned to the<br>University of walked into his PhD in<br>Audiology and uh that was supported by<br>garlet pass and Rodney Williams uh<br>Foundation research scholarship and he<br>graduated in<br>2004 he was appointed as a lecturer in<br>the section in 2001 and then he's risen<br>right through the ranks with in a fairly<br>Stellar way through to Professor here in<br>2023 uh he's currently the head of<br>Audiology and uh he position he actually<br>held also back in uh for 7 years from<br>200 7 and he's really had a major<br>influence on the direction of Audiology<br>at the University and in particular he<br>uh established the tentis and hearing<br>Clinic um at the University when we were<br>setting up the program and has managed<br>that and directed that over over a long<br>period of time he's also the deputy<br>director of the esor mo Center which is<br>a Center For Hearing and Balance<br>research and he also played has played<br>Major roles in the center of brain brain<br>research and more recently in TI talk<br>accelerator on the research front uh<br>Grant has numerous uh clinical and<br>research research interests in the field<br>of hearing and Audiology perhaps though<br>he is best known for in the field of<br>tenus and uh that things anybody doesn't<br>know is the we're not supposed to say<br>this but it's ringing in the ears but<br>he'll tell us it's actually not there<br>it's somewhere else um he<br>um he has a really enviable<br>International reputation in his field as<br>both a clinician and a researcher uh<br>tenus is a very distressing condition<br>for many and historically been a very<br>very difficult area of research to to to<br>pursue and uh there has been um an<br>enormous amount of of development in our<br>understanding of tenus and even the uh<br>heading in direction of developing of<br>developing treatments and uh that's over<br>the last 20 years and Grant has really<br>been one of the influential uh Le<br>leaders in that area at the Forefront of<br>the development of this work and um we<br>will see some of that<br>tonight he's recognized for his<br>Innovative research contributions and uh<br>finding that unusual angle that hasn't<br>been locked out before maybe he will<br>confess tonight that some of those<br>unusual angles might have been a little<br>bit too unusual but we'll uh we'll hear<br>about that um uh but he is also well<br>known for his ability to work uh with<br>multidisciplinary teams feeling at home<br>in many different disciplines right<br>across from psychology physiology<br>cognitive Neuroscience biomedical<br>engineering and neuronetwork Engineering<br>just to name a few he recognizes and I'm<br>sure he will discuss tonight that<br>treatments and Inter or interventions<br>fitist will come from different<br>approaches and uh which most likely<br>would need to be tailored to the<br>individual and I think that's probably<br>part of I'm surmising it's part of your<br>talk uh the there are um some of the<br>research metrics that tell us a lot<br>about his National and international<br>Eminence he's published 100 papers or<br>book chapters uh received over $14<br>million in research funding has been a<br>fair effect in the translation of that<br>research with the formation of uh two<br>spinout companies um that's tenus tunes<br>and true silence Therapeutics along with<br>numerous International consultancies and<br>contributions to clinical guidelines and<br>he is in very high demand as a<br>conference speaker both nationally and<br>internationally he's the editor of a<br>number of journals and um is also um on<br>the scientific Board of the American<br>tenus Association and the tenus research<br>initiative we must mention his teaching<br>contribution uh he's very well<br>recognized as an excellent and inspiring<br>teacher and uh has in both Audiology and<br>in medical science courses and is in<br>demand as a graduate supervisor having<br>supervised 124 Masters and honors<br>students and also 10 PhD students so<br>that's Quite a<br>feat um he contributes substantially<br>also to serice within the university and<br>uh and and certainly within the school<br>of population he's well regarded in the<br>work that he does for that as also in<br>the<br>community in close closing Grant you're<br>a wonderful colleague and I know that<br>you're a great mentor to many students<br>and staff uh Grant is highly respected<br>by his patients and takes a strong<br>interest in the their ongoing care and<br>well-being um helping advising and<br>supporting them uh even beyond the<br>consultancy period so I think that's<br>something to note he's a great<br>communicator um and this theater is like<br>tonight always full when you're speaking<br>so it's it's a wonderful recognition of<br>of your your talents um he's a great<br>communic sought after to contribute to<br>public talks about many aspects of<br>hearing and tenus indeed he could be<br>seen as a bit of a darling of the media<br>when it comes to uh things things<br>hearing uh he seems to be the go-to<br>person and does a wonderful job um as as<br>an<br>advocate Grant is well known for his<br>delightful quirky sense of humor we<br>might see a bit of that tonight um he<br>always has an eye for the unusual and<br>absurd and he doesn't take himself too<br>seriously his talks and lectures are<br>always dotted with humorous if not<br>somewhat weird anecdotes and images um<br>to illustrate various points and maybe<br>the title of his talk that we see<br>tonight wey E coyote and the Roadrunner<br>an analogy for career and tenus research<br>probably says it all so Grant um we all<br>sincerely congratulate you on this<br>wonderful um recognition and well welld<br>deserved recognition and we look forward<br>to your inaugural lecture so I give you<br>Professor searchfield be<br>ahead Oto Oto Oto<br>CA Co search too farel Co Grant tooa um<br>thank you all for for coming along to<br>this presentation I do feel I um an<br>awful lot of thanks to the welcoming<br>committee the official party thank you<br>very much uh Dean professor John Fraser<br>um my very good Mentor um Peter Thor and<br>also Jude um in preparation for your<br>kind comments that you'll make at the at<br>the end of the presentation<br>but I do have some explaining to do uh<br>about this title now uh I have to say<br>that as a child growing up in the<br>1970s uh the Road Runner and Wy coyote<br>was one of my favorite<br>cartoons and I thought that most people<br>would actually get the analogy um I was<br>somewhat shocked when my daughters<br>looked at me with a strange glance and<br>said who um I feel that's bad bad<br>parenting perhaps um but just to inform<br>everybody um Wy<br>coyote uh here represented as a very<br>frustrated<br>scientist would attempt in each episode<br>to capture the Road Runner and the<br>analogy here represented as<br>tinitus inevitably despite Road run uh<br>while a cot's best efforts he would fail<br>in his attempts to actually capture the<br>Road Runner and to a certain extent uh<br>my 20 odd years intus research has been<br>somewhat like<br>that someone feels that I am scientist<br>slowest and we have tenus<br>rapidus uh the analogy also extends<br>through to another range of factors that<br>I'm going to allude through in this talk<br>here um not least the sound which is<br>whoops very annoying um and I'd have to<br>say that Peter's impersonation was very<br>good so um if we keep on playing that<br>which I won't but I'll do it one more<br>time um this is not what people with<br>tenus experience as Peter mentioned uh<br>ringing is a common sound people will<br>experience hissing sounds<br>whistling<br>ringing and while we perhaps can<br>accommodate that for a short period of<br>time after a few hours I can assure you<br>that it becomes very<br>bothersome and the fact is that people's<br>attempts to<br>uh address<br>tenus have largely failed much in the<br>way that uh the coyote here has failed<br>to<br>capture the Road Runner I thought I'd<br>start out not at the very beginning but<br>early on in my clinical<br>career actually in the car park at Green<br>Lane Hospital except it wasn't a car<br>park at that particular point in time it<br>was uh prefab buildings related to World<br>War II um that had remained there as<br>part of Green Lane Hospital grounds and<br>that was where the O the ENT department<br>was based at the<br>time and I had the fortune of working<br>with uh Ron goody an emminent ear noos<br>and throat<br>specialist who in the early 198s had<br>attempted to get a tinitus clinic<br>working within audiology<br>through that space by the time that I<br>was uh practicing it had somewhat<br>dissipated largely due to the absence of<br>effective tools and tenus<br>management but I was faced regularly<br>with seeing patients who would say yes<br>you've done this hearing test that's<br>very well but actually the reason why<br>I'm here is the sound of my head and<br>ears and I just can't escape it it's<br>wherever I go it's there when I wake up<br>it's there when I go to bed it wakes me<br>up I can't separate myself from it and<br>it is really affecting me and the<br>frustration that I had was there were so<br>few tools aside from saying you know I<br>feel sorry for you um here's some advice<br>uh so<br>on uh also uh worth noting here um is<br>some early research in the Tinus field<br>that came in former Pharmaceuticals with<br>the use of intren<br>Lane this came out of the pain clinic at<br>Green Lane hospital where people<br>receiving uh l kane noted that the tenus<br>disappeared and Ron goody along with<br>Peter um who was very very young at the<br>time of This research incredibly young<br>researcher um published one of the first<br>pieces of work in this particular area<br>to this day intravenous Liane is one of<br>the very few treatments that can reduce<br>tnd significantly unfortunately its<br>effects a very short term and it does<br>have side effects but the effect never<br>since uh at the same time that I was<br>exploring uh clinical practice and<br>thinking about what could I do how could<br>I expand my my<br>knowledge I attended in 1995 uh TUS<br>conference in Portland Oregon and I had<br>the great Fortune of meeting Mary M and<br>Jack Vernon uh in this photo here and<br>they had actually established the<br>world's first tinitus clinic at Oregon<br>Health Sciences<br>University and their impact on my tenus<br>career uh or and scientific career was<br>enormous because I read about these<br>folks in journal articles they were<br>often the lead authors of multi-author<br>Publications and I was fresh out of uh<br>Audiology training and you know I was<br>really no<br>one and uh they were incredibly<br>welcoming and enthusiastic about the<br>fact that I was interested in tinitus<br>and I was really Amazed by this and they<br>really uh took me under their wing and<br>Ed some of that and that's something<br>that set a really good example for me uh<br>when meeting people particularly<br>students from overseas coming into an<br>environment to try and make them feel<br>welcome and for them to feel enabled and<br>empowered to undertake their own<br>research one of the major outcomes that<br>came from this collaboration over<br>several visits to Portland was<br>involvement in the development of a<br>tinitus<br>questionnaire because tenus is very<br>difficult to<br>characterize there is no single<br>objective measure to tell us whether a<br>person has tenus or does not because<br>it's both a sound and a<br>psychological complaint it's experienced<br>in very complex<br>ways so the best way to capture that has<br>been uh through the use of questioners<br>and at the time that we were beginning<br>this work there were multiple<br>questionnair used throughout the world<br>largely by the developers of those<br>questionnair themselves and so this was<br>hampering research because no one really<br>could compare outcomes to say my work is<br>equivalent to your work and so there was<br>a drive to um develop one questionnaire<br>to rule them all and and the outcome of<br>that which I was involved in uh was the<br>tin dysfunctional index which was a<br>great um start to to my career working<br>through that as part of a very<br>experienced research team and it also<br>has helped um my citations as well<br>tremendously because uh as it's the gold<br>standard whenever anybody does a trial<br>now they they cite this particular<br>reference if they're using it so that<br>that's fantastic but it really has begun<br>to uh be widely used and from this we've<br>done studies in New Zealand New Zealand<br>uh confirming its reliability and<br>appropriateness for the New Zealand<br>environment and it also has spawned a<br>lot of other ongoing research in the<br>area of<br>exploring tinitus related<br>outcomes now about the time that this<br>was happening I was working in private<br>practice that deal with<br>Audiology focusing on tenus<br>care but uh after a while as Peter<br>alluded there came an opportunity to<br>establish a clinic um under the aaces of<br>the University of Oakland and oriology<br>and this initially started in an old<br>building uh next to the National<br>audiology center both those buildings no<br>longer exist I think there are<br>Apartments there now and we were there<br>for a couple of years but with the<br>development of the Tamaki campus we<br>moved into new purpose belt uh rooms<br>there at the school of population Health<br>which also began our engagement<br>there uh<br>subsequently uh 2019 we moved across the<br>road again into wonderful<br>facilities now what this has enabled is<br>both for us to grow our<br>capacity to train<br>students in an environment in which uh<br>public practice of Audiology wasn't so<br>meable to having students andly large<br>number of students out<br>practicing it also enabled us to develop<br>new clinical methodologies and be at The<br>Cutting Edge of introducing<br>new<br>treatments so since this establishment<br>hundreds of students have gone through<br>that uh hopefully they have learned uh<br>best practice and continue that out when<br>they go into the community but the<br>facilities have also enabled us to<br>undertake uh a number of research<br>studies often commercially focused in<br>which hearing a companies are three of<br>the largest five hearing a companies in<br>the world the world phonic oon ReSound<br>have used our resources to undertake<br>clinical trials or proof of principle<br>Trials of their hearing devices and also<br>from some of the tenus methods that have<br>developed out of the clinic we've made a<br>Tunes one of the uh barriers to Tinus<br>Kia is<br>is enabling audiologists to<br>engage with people that are often<br>distressed and this could be a little<br>bit of a barrier for audiologists<br>actually moving into the the ten space<br>uh the fear around uh the counseling<br>aspect of<br>practice one of the tools that developed<br>from an existing hearing aid tool was<br>the client oriented scale of improvement<br>uh in tinitus and this has now become<br>widely used in Canada and the United<br>States it's used in Veterans Affairs as<br>a research tool it's a goal attainment<br>scaling tool in which rather than using<br>a standard questionnaire we engage with<br>the client as a person to understand the<br>particular problems that they are<br>experiencing in their own words in their<br>own particular<br>environment we then are able to identify<br>what the priorities of these particular<br>goals are for their treatment and then<br>we can act on those and move through the<br>treatment process and rate them so this<br>is a great supplement to the traditional<br>questioner design and also from this and<br>the questions that are used here we're<br>developing AI tools to enable us to<br>predict based on what individuals say is<br>the problem that they're experiencing<br>but best method of treatment and this<br>touches upon the the personalized care<br>that Peter is me uh mentioned in the<br>introduction befitting uh someone who's<br>based in a school of population Health<br>it's useful to have um some population<br>health statistics as well uh this was<br>one of the largest samples of tenus uh<br>individuals contacted about tenus<br>internationally<br>uh as far as I know it's still the the<br>largest and we have reasonable<br>information based on questions about do<br>you have tinitus and have you had it for<br>longer than 12 months in the New Zealand<br>population so on average it affects<br>around about 6% of us but that grows<br>rapidly to well over<br>133% amongst the over<br>65s it's slightly more prevalent amongst<br>males and females but they may represent<br>traditional workplace roles historically<br>with males being more likely to be<br>exposed to uh noise induced hearing<br>loss we can see it's fairly evenly<br>represented around the country uh<br>slightly higher in Wellington and it's a<br>really old joke but a good one that I<br>say it's basically due to the<br>politicians<br>uh one of the interesting factors that<br>we haven't been able to explain and<br>there a real shame and a gap in our<br>knowledge is the difference<br>between different ethnicities in New<br>Zealand so tinitus is most highly<br>prevalent amongst New Zealand<br>Europeans least prevalent amongst New<br>Zealand Asians and proportionately<br>relative to other health related<br>problems mly are underrepresented in ten<br>statistics<br>we don't know<br>why uh we do have ongoing work to try<br>and explore this a little bit further<br>are there genetic factors are there<br>cultural factors was there a design<br>problem with the questionnaire that was<br>used from this work we found out all<br>sorts of things I'm not going to dwell<br>too much on this but uh two two main<br>factors females with tenus experience it<br>differently from males with tenus<br>males are more likely to complain about<br>the hearing loss related factors females<br>are more likely to have insomnia with<br>their tinitus and also have vestibular<br>problems if we look down the bottom We<br>compare over 65s with tinitus and those<br>without those with tinitus are more<br>likely to have other<br>comorbidities as well particularly those<br>associated with the hearing system so<br>it's a complex phenomenon again both<br>sound and<br>brain and this is where we begin to try<br>and find where does tinitus actually<br>originate from what is the cause of<br>tinitus we know that most people who<br>experience tenus will have a hearing<br>loss but for some that hearing loss<br>won't be significant and won't show up<br>in a hearing<br>test we also know that one operation<br>that used to be undertaken which was the<br>sectioning of the auditory nerve so to<br>prevent the transmission of activity<br>from the inner ear to the brain was not<br>successful and in fact um many people<br>were left with greater tenus and of<br>course no matter what their tenus was<br>they were left with no Hearing in that<br>ear after the<br>operation so there's this association<br>with hearing loss but also there must be<br>something happening beyond the<br>year and uh my my research in the space<br>um this is a much younger version of of<br>me skinnier version here um um began<br>exploring this uh with Peter and as you<br>know Peter's Focus outside of as many<br>other areas um has been a lot around<br>physiology and to understand what was<br>happening at the level of the a we want<br>to be able to relatively easy record<br>auditory nerve activity in instead of<br>recording from Individual<br>neurons we placed a little silver wire<br>with a little ball on the end in the<br>inner at the inner air through the<br>middle air space and we're able to<br>record the electrical activity of the<br>cocka the cckar nerve known as emble<br>spontaneous activity and represented on<br>a spectrum here as electrical activity<br>with a peak around about 1,000 hurt so<br>this represents the ongoing activity<br>from the<br>nerve and we explored this activity with<br>different pathologies that arise in<br>tinitus and we noticed what other people<br>had noticed is a reduction in auditory<br>activity but some changes in<br>morphology in particular in some<br>conditions the development of a low<br>frequency um spectral element there<br>that some people had alluded to as being<br>an acute indicator of tinitus what we<br>also found that um now I'm even more<br>fascinated by to be honest than I was at<br>the time when I was trying to really<br>just get this done um was the fact that<br>um noise sounds so hissing sounds would<br>drive increased this neural activity<br>which is what you would expect because<br>uh it's showing increased activity in<br>the auditory nerve but somewhat<br>unusually tones would decrease it it<br>would actually reduce the spontaneous<br>activity and we now think this is some<br>form of early adaptive uh process in the<br>auditory nerve or clear nucleus in<br>response uh to<br>sound one of the problems potentially in<br>what we're looking at and has faced<br>people for quite some time<br>is the fact that tenus may originate<br>from this air damage but it seems that<br>after about six weeks that changes so<br>there's a six week window where<br>potentially you could intervene with a<br>drug at the inner ear before it becomes<br>a central<br>problem that's a problem because when<br>people develop tenus generally they say<br>oh it's going to go away and they're not<br>going to seek help within 6 weeks the<br>majority it's very difficult to get<br>people into research with acute problems<br>so much of the focus has been on chronic<br>aspects of the tenus and the movement<br>essentially from tenus being a<br>sound into what has recently become<br>coined tenus disorder and this<br>involves essentially the whole brain<br>rather than tus just activating the<br>auditory cortex we see many regions of<br>the brain evolved in problematic T I've<br>got a little animation here of some EEG<br>activity<br>recorded from a group of individuals for<br>whom we were able to suppress their<br>tenus for around 60 to 70% of people<br>with tenus if you play a loud sound for<br>a minute for approximately 30 seconds<br>the tenus will dis disappear before it<br>comes back up extremely rarely that<br>suppression might last for minutes and<br>Incredibly really it might last for an<br>hour or so so it's not really a<br>treatment but it's a fascinating tool<br>for probing the ear in this<br>animation you'll see some pictures of a<br>head you'll see lots of different colors<br>flashing the blue colors represent<br>decreased activity the red colors<br>represent increased in activity recorded<br>head now so that's a very short period<br>of time when that we're comparing before<br>and after the suppression of tenus and<br>what you can see is the brain is very<br>Dynamic it's changing all the time this<br>last shot here is somewhat<br>representative of the average when the<br>tinitus is suppressed there's increased<br>activation within uh the hearing areas<br>of the brain and decreased activity in<br>frontal uh lobe regions associated with<br>uh<br>attention various models have been<br>developed to try and express this<br>combining um studies such as ourselves<br>or the MRI with anatomical studies<br>highlighting different regions of the<br>brain that potentially are targets for<br>therapy a key aspect that is isn't<br>necessarily achieved by um some of the<br>neurophysiological techniques yet is<br>understanding the unreality of tinitus<br>so just to explain this picture here now<br>Wy coyote often in his bag of tricks in<br>order to uh capture a Road Runner would<br>paint a mural on a wall that represented<br>a tunnel the idea is that the Road<br>Runner would simply run into the wall<br>fall over and W Co would be able to<br>capture the Road Runner but inevitably<br>episode after episode in fact the Road<br>Runner would be able to run through the<br>mural Co Wy coyote would then stand in<br>front of the mural and evitably would be<br>run over by a truck now what has this<br>got to do with with tinitus it<br>represents an<br>unreality in the sense tenus is<br>unreal it's a sound that people hear is<br>not imagined but it's not a real sound<br>in our<br>environment around us there are sounds<br>that we can interact with if we really<br>quiet we can hear the fans of the<br>projectors after a moment we recognize<br>that sound from our memory there are no<br>memories for<br>fortunatus we can interact we can move<br>around we can localize where this sound<br>is coming from we potentially can get<br>closer to it it gets louder this is very<br>very real timus is incredibly unreal<br>wherever I go whatever I do wherever I<br>move it's the same it goes with me all<br>right this this is something that the<br>sensory system has no context<br>for this is why there also is a strong<br>association with MRI scans between<br>activity in the visual cortex and<br>tinitus because the brain's trying to<br>make sense what is this sound that is<br>being heard but does not belong to any<br>particular<br>object and this has been important<br>because it's enables us to to<br>investigate various models both from a<br>point of view of perception of the<br>tenous sound what is happening that<br>means that it's difficult to<br>ignore and according to this flowchart<br>that we developed essentially the<br>aspects of tinitus are detected as we<br>would detect any normal sound we try and<br>match it to features that are existing<br>in our templates of what sound actually<br>should be and there is no match so as a<br>consequence the auditory system focuses<br>on the tenus when it focuses on the<br>tenus it becomes better at hearing the<br>tenus when you get better at hearing the<br>tenus you focus more on the tenus so on<br>and so forth so much so that individuals<br>who have tenus severely have poor<br>cognition because they have less<br>capacity to actually spend on other<br>tasks also related to this in the<br>psychology is the fact that beliefs can<br>have a huge impact on<br>tenus I'm not going to go into this a<br>lot of detail but I'm going to pick on<br>religion for a moment so some people can<br>experience tenus and see it as a<br>blessing because it's perceived that<br>their deity is speaking with them and<br>who doesn't want to get messages from<br>God that's a great thing right so I'm<br>going to be really positive about that<br>but for other people it's actually at<br>the other end of the scale it's seen as<br>demonic possession and those people<br>don't want to mention the fact they have<br>tenus because of the interaction with<br>their their Community now normally it's<br>not those extremes but the context can<br>affect the perception right the<br>perception<br>can affect the<br>context T This is complicated right it's<br>one of the reasons why I got interested<br>in it because when I started out I<br>thought well here's something that I<br>won't make myself redundant in I'll keep<br>this my favorite thing about the<br>Roadrunner Wy coyote show was the fact<br>that the coyote would go looking for<br>Innovative new ways to capture the Road<br>Runner and would often call on Acme now<br>Acme I think is sort of like a 1960s<br>version of what Amazon or Alibaba would<br>be in the future you can get anything in<br>Acme and to a certain extent tenus<br>research has been a little bit like that<br>generally there's been an idea people<br>have said why don't we try that with tin<br>to see if it<br>works as with the Road Runner more often<br>than not it<br>hasn't so looking at medications now um<br>through my questionnaire U development<br>work and um seeing expertise and<br>clinical trials in this particular area<br>I've worked with a number of different<br>uh pharmaceutical companies looking to<br>develop pharmaceutical treatments for<br>tinitus because everyone who has tinitus<br>and is bothered by it would like to have<br>a pill to take it away that's what we<br>generally would like something quick<br>easy I can do take with a glass of water<br>eat with food you know have with food<br>and my tenus will be<br>gone and we can see the promise from the<br>1970s through now uh we haven't achieved<br>that um there's been a particular effort<br>to try and develop drugs that act at the<br>level of the inner ear on<br>the ha cell receptors and the auditory<br>nerve uh<br>gine is a particular non uh nmda<br>receptor antagonist so this blocks<br>particular type of neural activity<br>within the inner ear has been shown<br>previously in animal-based research to<br>be potentially a useful pharmaceutical<br>forus and we were involved in a uh small<br>phase one study to look at the<br>effectiveness of one of those drugs in a<br>preparation that would last within the<br>middle ear for a period of time and so<br>would be a slow release to the inner<br>ear uh this is based on the TFI another<br>um great citation even if it is a self<br>citation of it uh here showing the<br>number of individuals in dark blue who<br>achieved a clinically meaningful change<br>in the dys functional index so we can<br>have statistical changes and then we can<br>have meaningful changes something that<br>will actually be of benefit to<br>individual going up we see this<br>difference now the most important thing<br>here to note is the difference between<br>the active drug and the<br>placebo so this was encouraging here we<br>have one of the few studies that<br>indicated a drug might be effective in<br>turning down<br>tinitus so the company invested into a<br>larger clinical trial with about<br>150 um participants half of them<br>received Oto<br>313 and half of them received a<br>placebo there was applied for acute<br>tinitus which I thought would really be<br>the group that would benefit from this<br>given the in a mechanisms it was also<br>applied to chronic chronic T sufferers<br>because the market for a pharmaceutical<br>company and tinitus is very<br>small and we got some encouraging<br>results<br>however Roadrunner escaped again um<br>because unfortunately of a very large<br>placebo effect so this is of course if<br>you take a sugar pill or in this case an<br>injection into the air that has no<br>active ingredient it works<br>and confusing<br>and<br>unresolved in chronic<br>tenus it was more effective as a placebo<br>than acute<br>tenus um this uh you know we haven't<br>been able to<br>explain um the acute results if we will<br>look at them we promising unfortunately<br>these uh<br>chronic results where the placebo is<br>more effective than the active control<br>control um ended any further research<br>this company no longer is undertaking<br>research despite there being some<br>promise we've also done um as Peter has<br>mentioned um some slightly interesting<br>research on<br>medications this is some work that we've<br>done on ecstasy um mom you know um don't<br>worry I where is Mom I write the back up<br>there yeah sorry mom um I didn't take<br>any of this it's all okay all right um<br>so<br>MDMA is a um a drug that's obviously<br>used in the nightclub scene and we<br>became interested in this because of the<br>number of people that came into our<br>clinic this again the value of having an<br>operation tenus Clinic we get these<br>observations who said I probably<br>shouldn't tell you this and I've only<br>ever done it once yeah right um but I've<br>taken ecstasies and my tenis went<br>completely<br>gone came back next day but completely<br>gone which was interesting and we looked<br>a little bit into pharmacology of this<br>and it's almost like a super duper dose<br>of uh anti-depressants all at once Mon<br>and we thought this was a reasonable<br>thing to look at<br>unfortunately uh the placebo effect<br>again was very large and we didn't see a<br>behavioral difference between our groups<br>people got high on the sugar pill they<br>honestly believed that they were<br>receiving the MDMA and acted in a way<br>that they presumed people having MDMA<br>would even though this was a very low<br>dose however one thing that was in<br>encouraging is we did MRI before and<br>after these individuals so our two hours<br>after taking the measured dose of the<br>MDMA and the changes that we saw were<br>the reduction and Connections in areas<br>associated with emotional uh activity<br>increases in areas related to attention<br>and perception we're somewhat consistent<br>with the literature and changes that we<br>might expect in an individual going from<br>a tenus spa um situation to a non-us<br>case to be honest as an audiologist<br>undertaking pharmaceutical research is<br>very difficult leading it because I<br>don't dispense medications and I don't<br>understand the<br>pharmacology um so my research in this<br>area has been somewhat limited and I've<br>been been very happy to pass this on to<br>others that have interested in the the<br>pharmacology but where my real interest<br>has been is in<br>gadgets things that may or may not<br>influence tinitus so our Clinic was one<br>of the first to trial the new monics<br>tinitus treatment device in the top<br>there uh this used music that had been<br>altered for the individual's hearing<br>loss and tuned essentially to provide a<br>better form of cover bring up tinitus<br>the timing of this device wasn't<br>particularly good for the manufacturers<br>because as you can see it looks a little<br>bit like an old-fashioned uh MP3 player<br>all right um and it was marketed as a<br>medical<br>quality MP3 player costing $4,000 when<br>at the time you could access these um<br>you know for for<br>$500 um while it worked<br>it was not widely accepted because of<br>the cost associated with it and the<br>belief that I could actually do this on<br>my own<br>player another interesting device and<br>this was actually work undertaken by uh<br>two German medical students who came<br>here um through the clinic for some<br>external experience so another benefit<br>of having the hearing ATT tenus Clinic<br>is we've had around about 50<br>uh externships through New York Medical<br>School and through various um<br>universities in uh Germany and Europe<br>coming through to get some experience in<br>the Audiology area one thing that we we<br>looked at was this particular device the<br>realus which involved you sticking it in<br>the<br>ear and it would vibrate the ear at a<br>particular frequency and the idea was<br>that the vibration itself would initiate<br>nerve activity that would somehow<br>suppress the tinitus um it sounded<br>toothbrush and we tested it and we<br>believe that the effect was due to the<br>fact that it sounded like an electric<br>toothbrush and it was actually the sound<br>that was beneficial rather than there<br>being ex anything extra special about<br>the air stimulation the other area that<br>we did do quite a lot of work on uh<br>particularly U gaj uh shikat who's now a<br>professor in Audiology in Australia is<br>the area of<br>U uh transcranial direct current<br>stimulation and this uses a very<br>low-level electric current with the idea<br>that you can change the underlying<br>electrical activity near the surface of<br>the scalp that might be responsible for<br>tinitus and you can do this in various<br>ways and a lot of our work uh set the<br>parameters for exploring this as a<br>research tool we're holding out hope<br>that this might assist in tenous<br>treatment but what we found is the<br>benefits were very short<br>lived less than 24 hours a person would<br>come into Clinic we do this they notice<br>some suppression of the tenus they come<br>back the next day it was back to where<br>it was we also combined this with<br>hearing aids with the belief that we<br>could combine the electrical stimulation<br>to promote the benefit of the hearing<br>aids essentially the hearing aids was so<br>much more<br>beneficial that there was very limited<br>effect of this electrical stimulation<br>and for me that somewhat ended my clinic<br>um pursuit of this as a clinical<br>strategy essentially the road runner in<br>my view had escaped in this particular<br>treatment<br>but um it didn't uh prevent us having a<br>look at hearing aids and the bulk of my<br>published work has been in the hearing<br>aid space these are just four individual<br>studies uh anything below the dotted<br>line indicates an individual who has had<br>Improvement in their tenus hearing aids<br>are beneficial but I want to point out<br>here that some people have huge<br>benefit all right some people have<br>tremendous benefit<br>other<br>so so why is it that these individuals<br>benefit so much essentially their tenus<br>aids and this is where the drive for<br>personalization and tailoring therapy<br>for individuals with tinitus comes from<br>how can we improve<br>that hearing aid manufacturers have<br>developed uh smartphone apps that enable<br>some<br>customization and a research study that<br>um pH and I Phil's uh ra no uh<br>sorry research fellow research fellow<br>with me um has shown is the benefit of<br>modern hearing a technology both for new<br>users but also for existing users as<br>well of their current hearing aids the<br>some ability to use the app and to for<br>us to fit the hearing aids in a slightly<br>more customized way can have tremendous<br>benefit uh again to dysfunctional index<br>here again increasing my<br>citations but it's not really seen as<br>self citation if it's something that you<br>standard<br>um from this we've also found that there<br>is a spal element to Tinus perception as<br>well when we say tenus is in ringing in<br>the ears as Peter quite rightly<br>incorrectly said<br>um it's often a sound that actually has<br>a spatial aspect to it it's not just<br>heard at the ear or at the ears it can<br>be at the front of the head the back of<br>the head or in some cases external a<br>position in<br>space and we know from Psych Acoustics<br>if you separate two sound sources it is<br>easier to tell them apart so a lot about<br>our our work has been to try and move a<br>sound to cover the<br>tinitus both with the nature of the<br>sound but also in terms of its<br>characteristics how it sounds but also<br>spatial representation and through that<br>it means we can use a lower level of<br>sound and increase its Effectiveness the<br>further away in a virtual present<br>the sound is less effective even though<br>it's the same loudness right we're<br>controlling for loud even though it's<br>the same loudness it becomes less<br>effective and the majority of people<br>will prefer a sound that interferes with<br>space in order for us to be able to do<br>this clinically we've used technology<br>available at the time we started by<br>using um<br>iPods and wired into hearing aids so<br>essentially we're pre-recording the 3D<br>tracks and then we're connecting up to<br>to wires people don't like wires so it's<br>only ever going to be an experimental<br>methodology but as hearing aids<br>developed Bluetooth streaming first to<br>an external device that was held in a<br>pocket that would then go to the hearing<br>aid through to now where we can uh<br>stream directly to hearing aids we've<br>suddenly got all these tools open to us<br>where we can present sound in cool and<br>funky ways to try and suppress<br>tinitus and we've been looking at what<br>happens in the brain and being able to<br>model that using um a machine learning<br>techniques um some of these developed<br>outside um an aut University that we've<br>incorporated in tenus<br>this is so good that when we record from<br>ahead here we're actually at the<br>position where we can tell with over 90<br>5% accuracy whether an individual is<br>going to benefit from the our particular<br>tenus treatment or not that's relatively<br>binary yes will work no it won't but<br>that's actually better than all the<br>questionnaire data that we ask so<br>recording these electrical potentials<br>where a person's just sitting there can<br>tell us whether treatment is going to be<br>effective if we think about that in a<br>medical system perspective if we're not<br>spending money on a treatment that's not<br>we don't spend money on a<br>treatment because we know it's not going<br>to work then we're going to make savings<br>both at individual level our system<br>level where we want to go with this<br>information is to be far more accurate<br>rather than binary to tell what<br>treatment is going to be beneficial when<br>what are the indicators recorded from<br>the head or from heart rate other<br>factors that are going to tell us this<br>person is ready for this particular<br>treatment intervention at this<br>PDA yeah yeah all right<br>um by the way this is not public display<br>of affection all right a PDA is if you<br>like a precursor today<br>smartphones um essentially it was the<br>diary function on your on your phone and<br>you carry you thought you were you know<br>absolutely technology topnotch but we<br>began using this to develop games for<br>tinitus<br>treatment starting with uh laptops<br>moving on to the PDA and the limiting<br>Computing ability of those now to moving<br>on to smartphones starting out with very<br>simple displays and an individual has to<br>navigate their way around this<br>environment to more complex visually<br>appealing interfaces that are uh<br>available through today's personal<br>assistance now the idea behind these<br>training games is they use different<br>sounds<br>they also incorporate the individual's<br>tenous experience in some of<br>these what we do is we capture what the<br>person is experiencing at that<br>particular point in time and that sound<br>is invol um incorporated into the<br>auditory training as part of the<br>environment that they have to ignore so<br>it's present they have to ignore that<br>and navigate their way through other<br>sound environments so essentially what<br>we're trying to do is we're trying to<br>unwind that flow chart that I showed you<br>earlier around attention and focus on<br>the tinitus sound and normalize the<br>activity so it's changed to focus on<br>non- tinitus<br>sounds if a person's tinitus changes so<br>does the game and this also enables us<br>to track the individual's tenus on a<br>daily basis to understand what is<br>changing and how is it changing again<br>potentially enabling uh feedback to<br>improve treatments um in the first<br>trials that we were doing that we were<br>comparing this to uh Tetris uh a visual<br>block game with no sound and we obtained<br>benefit from that and then we progressed<br>to incorporate other cues as well so as<br>well as just having auditory information<br>we included little vibrating pads on the<br>side of the the head and visual cues to<br>try and train the individual to not<br>attend to the tenus again we got<br>significant improvements over the<br>various measures that we achieved<br>there but the idea of<br>personalization the reason why W coyote<br>failed except once to capture a Road<br>Runner is he always just used one<br>approach right never multiple at the<br>same time never realizing that there was<br>more to<br>capturing this cartoon bird than one<br>approach and if you used multiple at the<br>same time your chance of increasing<br>would be much<br>greater so our efforts have been in to<br>develop something that we've called a<br>digital poly<br>therapeutic and this is based around<br>all the previous work that we've done to<br>try and optimize treatment based on<br>individual characteristics but not with<br>one mode of intervention with multiple<br>and multiple interventions that will<br>change with that individual as they<br>progress through their treatment so if<br>one thing isn't working the treatment<br>will change to another and we believe<br>that over time this will become smarter<br>and smarter so this is just a<br>visualization of some of the the<br>treatment<br>components from instruction and<br>counseling to the sound therapy using<br>the 3D to the auditory training using<br>the various games and it's all guided<br>through goal assessment and that coet<br>that I mentioned earlier where we're um<br>rating identifying and then rating goals<br>and then those goals determine the most<br>approp therapy intervention and over<br>time as we gather data we'll be able to<br>become smarter and smarter at the<br>particular problem and how that<br>interfaces with a particular<br>treatment so we undertook a a trial<br>comparing our therapeutic with a control<br>app that's available for tenus use from<br>the App<br>Store and we got some really encouraging<br>results um within the different<br>categories of change within the Tim<br>dysfunctional index a much higher uh<br>percentage response of participants<br>receiving a treatment much greater<br>change in our T functional index<br>score in<br>benchmarking against other treatments<br>the effect size of our treatment the<br>Prototype was much larger um and these<br>are all um aside from this one which rec<br>recently has come off Market largely<br>because of this result um are<br>commercially available and widely used<br>now so um while it might be a little bit<br>optimistic to say um we've entirely<br>captured the Road Runner we think we're<br>a long way to making the Road Runner<br>give up right we haven't cure tenus um<br>this particular article uh that we<br>published received a huge amount of<br>interest from from media around the<br>world um you know I think within the<br>first month I'd received 2,000 emails<br>from people asking to be part of Trials<br>and so<br>on little known fact um Wy coyote did<br>capture the road runner in one<br>episode all right and he said okay now<br>that I've caught him what do I do with<br>them right so now that we actually got a<br>treatment what are we going to do about<br>that uh in the case of Wy C yes he did<br>capture the Roadrunner but he was 200<br>times the size that he normally was and<br>so he couldn't do anything uh with them<br>but in our case um with working with<br>Oakland un Services we've developed<br>spinout company and are currently<br>undertaking uh work to develop our<br>commercially available uh digital<br>therapeutic and in that we've got a lot<br>of different ideas that we weren't able<br>to do on our prototype which was done on<br>a<br>shoestring the future again we haven't<br>cure in us we're getting better we're at<br>a comfortable point where we feel like<br>we've got something real and meaningful<br>to take into the market because it's<br>better than anything else that exists<br>there but we also believe that we can<br>enhance<br>that um work underway by by some of the<br>team and looking at virtual reality to<br>engage attention augmented reality to<br>enable at home use again with phone but<br>to include visual information to<br>overcome that unreality of tinitus can<br>we actually make tinitus more real by<br>using virtual reality or augmented<br>reality in order to trick or train the<br>brain into perceiving this is something<br>real mentioned the use of uh augmented<br>reality and some of the work that emtb<br>is doing with us and group from aut and<br>ABI is developing uh a<br>headset based on our artificial<br>intelligence modeling that can be worn<br>at home because it only contains a few<br>recording sites that are most important<br>for tenus and we believe that a system<br>like this will result in a very smart um<br>therapy that will basically learn from<br>the biosensor information and switch<br>from treatment to treatment based on the<br>measurements that we actually achieve<br>and that's our longterm vision for where<br>lab so some thank you uh it's important<br>to note that this work doesn't happen<br>without many people being involved uh<br>I've received regeneris funding from a<br>number of different Oran<br>organizations both within the university<br>environment uh philanthropic groups and<br>also external uh to New Zealand as well<br>with the American tenus<br>Association also I have developed really<br>good working networks with a wide range<br>of<br>disciplines that can advise me and shake<br>the head when I come up with an a dumb<br>idea and say no it doesn't work in that<br>way or no you can't do that occasionally<br>oh I wonder whether we could do that is<br>as the reply so networks have been<br>hugely beneficial for for my work right<br>I'm an expert in nothing apart from<br>knowing a bit about tenus all these<br>other fields have contributed to the<br>breadth of work that I've been able to<br>undertake uh and that includes our own<br>is Mo Center here at the University of<br>Oakland within this faculty which is is<br>really excellent particularly the way<br>it's bringing on uh emerging<br>researchers to push us along to<br>challenge<br>us then um as with the TV show there are<br>many different characters and I've<br>benefited from many different uh folks<br>contributing to the environment so I'm<br>very grateful to all of those that have<br>undertaken work at various times over<br>the last 20 years um and I haven't<br>listed all the students you know the 120<br>odd students many of those doing uh<br>tenus research that have contributed to<br>that as well and all these folks have<br>largely kept me San all right uh at<br>times I do feel a little bit like this<br>frazzled from frantically tasting my<br>tail in order to capture the Road<br>Runner so thank you all for for coming<br>uh and if you haven't learned anything<br>about tenus perhaps you've learned<br>something about the Road Runner and Wy<br>coyot and if that's the case my job here<br>is done all right so thank you very</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
