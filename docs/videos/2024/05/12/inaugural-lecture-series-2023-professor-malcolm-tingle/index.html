lecture for Malcolm<br>tingle um inaugural lectures are meant<br>to be events where there is great fun um<br>where there's recognition of lots of<br>hard work that has been accomplished and<br>where family to see what people do in<br>their day jobs so we hope that it's<br>going to be all of those things Malcolm<br>no pressure um um but knowing you and<br>your resilience and your um quickness<br>perhaps um um your humor I'm really<br>looking forward to this lecture this<br>evening um for those of you who not<br>familiar with inaugural lectures this<br>really is a mark of Distinction of what<br>people have achieved um to be to join<br>the professorial<br>um uh the application process alone uh<br>fails a small part of the Amazon<br>rainforest um and takes up several weeks<br>and months of people's lives and that's<br>not all the work that needs to go into<br>it so it is not a trivial undertaking<br>and it is a mark of real recognition and<br>so Malcolm we really want to acknowledge<br>you tonight we want to thank you for the<br>work and we are looking forward to<br>hearing how you've done it but I'm going<br>to Paul Donaldson who knows you very<br>well and you're perhaps going to share<br>the odd secret um introduce you forly so<br>Paul thank you oric no my Oto<br>otoa Co Paul Donaldson tokoa and it's my<br>privilege to be the head of the school<br>of medical sciences and the school of<br>medical Sciences is uh contains within<br>it the department of pharmacology and<br>clinical pharmacology of which Malcolm<br>is the head of department so that makes<br>me if feel like um Malcolm's line<br>manager and boss I'm actually aware that<br>I'm not the only boss of Malcolm in the<br>room uh we have to acknowledge his his<br>family that is here Nola uh and his<br>daughter and other friends that have<br>come to to share with this occasion with<br>Malcolm and noler I wonder um if you<br>have the same kind of problems have I've<br>had is actually making Malcolm do<br>something he doesn't want to do and this<br>actually was trying to get him to<br>actually apply to become a professor<br>because in my view he was well overdue<br>the honor but in typical form Malcolm<br>put it off because he was too busy<br>helping other people to possibly do<br>anything to help<br>himself and uh so it was with great<br>pleasure that he actually finally did<br>apply and um and as War has said it's<br>not a easy undertaking and it took quite<br>a bit of time time and I'm just so<br>delighted at the result that we've got<br>we can be here today so my role in the<br>ceremony is to give you some overview of<br>Malcolm's journey to why and how we got<br>here and it usually starts off with a<br>kind of<br>a run through his resume and so<br>Malcolm's academic Journey started in<br>1984 with the BC honors and biochemistry<br>and pharmacology from the University of<br>South Hampton that makes him um English<br>and therefore not a supporter of the All<br>Blacks but we can discuss that later<br>this was followed by a PhD in<br>Pharmacology at the University of<br>Liverpool which was obtained in 1988<br>this was followed by a period of<br>post-doctoral research at Liverpool<br>which culminated in Malcolm being<br>appointed to a lectureship in the dep<br>Department of pharmacology at the<br>University of Liverpool in<br>1994 then Malcolm and family arrived in<br>ockland in 1997 to take up a lectureship<br>in toxicology in the department of<br>pharmacology and clinical pharmacology<br>here at the University of Oakland<br>Malcolm progressed through the ranks<br>being promoted to senior lectur at 2001<br>to associate professor in<br>2010 and then was appointed as the head<br>of the Department of pharmacology and<br>clinical pharmacology in<br>2016 uh in addition more recently he's<br>been serving as the acting academic<br>director of the school of medical<br>Sciences since<br>2021 come a little bit Insight why he's<br>been quite busy<br>recently and today we're are here to<br>celebrate Malcolm's latest milestone in<br>his academic Journey his promotion to<br>professor as pointed out by War the pro<br>promotion Professor is a rigorous<br>process in which academic contributions<br>to<br>teaching research and Leadership service<br>to the university and WI our community<br>are assessed in this regard Malcolm has<br>excelled in all three domains Malcolm is<br>an excellent teacher and a master of his<br>discipline<br>knowledge uh which is around drug<br>toxicity and safety initially appointed<br>to deliver his this content into the<br>pharmacology major in the medical<br>program as the faculty has grown uh from<br>a medical school into um a true faculty<br>of Health Professions and medical<br>Sciences um Malcolm's workload has<br>increased as the scope of practice uh of<br>these professions has actually extended<br>so Malcolm is now teaching into the<br>disciplines of um the pharmacy<br>curriculum Medical Imaging postgraduate<br>nursing as well as general education<br>courses<br>as the need for teaching of the<br>principles of pharmacology has expanded<br>malm has led the Redevelopment of the<br>pharmacology curriculum to ensure that<br>the content aligned with internationally<br>recognized curricular this experience of<br>curriculum design in Malcolm's<br>encyclopedia likee knowledge of course<br>regulations has proved invaluable in his<br>role as academic director especially as<br>the university embarks upon the<br>curriculum transformation<br>project as a University academic Malcolm<br>has embraced the concept of research Le<br>teaching and that his teaching is<br>informed by the research that he<br>undertakes and his real life experience<br>on a variety of regulatory<br>bodies in this regard without stealing<br>Malcolm Thunder of his presentation and<br>I quote from his application Malcolm's<br>Research into the field of drug toxicity<br>from a theoretical approach to the<br>understanding of the influence of the<br>physiochemical characteristics of a<br>molecule on its metabolism and toxicity<br>through the design of vitro methods to<br>screen for toxic Metabo<br>formation we'll take a breath species<br>differences metabolism has long has been<br>a long-standing interest of malcolms in<br>particular the assessment of toxicity<br>into preclinical species its relevance<br>to humans studies and humans has ranged<br>from those in healthy human volunteers<br>patients on therapy into postmortem<br>analyses similar techniques have been<br>applied to scream compounds for their<br>potential as species selective<br>rodenticides the common theme of<br>Malcolm's research has been to the<br>development of analytical analytical<br>techniques that allow accurate and<br>precise determination of drug metabolite<br>concentrations in biological tissues for<br>the identification of metabolic roots<br>and determination of pharmacological<br>parameters I'm sure Malcolm make it far<br>more interesting than what I've just<br>said so you don't need to go to it or<br>you can actually get the real insight<br>from Malcolm however on a less technical<br>side um in a more of a human face of<br>Malcolm's research I think we can't look<br>past the fact that Malcolm has been an<br>excellent supervisor and has to date<br>supervised some 11 honor students 25<br>Master students and 17 PhD students<br>during the course of his career and it's<br>a testament to his um supervision many<br>of those students have gone onto their<br>own academic<br>careers in terms of academic outputs<br>Malcolm's research has produced some 94<br>articles and peer review journals and 44<br>abstracts and peer-reviewed Conference<br>proceedings and this has generated many<br>millions of dollars in research funding<br>to Res sources research efforts but<br>again more important than these metrics<br>of<br>research uh research output has been the<br>impact of Malcolm's work on public<br>policy through Malcolm's appointment to<br>a variety of committees that have uh had<br>a direct effect on impact on New Zealand<br>legislation and<br>regulations this has included the<br>psychoactive substance expert advisory<br>committee in which Malcolm had a lead<br>role in determining the safety<br>requirements for consideration of of at<br>low risk of harm under the psychoactive<br>substance act and subsequently to<br>evaluate based on the results of trials<br>with psychoactive products should or<br>should not be approved for use by<br>individuals so that's kind had a bit of<br>influence<br>there uh<br>interestingly um he has also been<br>appointed on the uh independent expert<br>panel on drunk driving to assess what<br>effects these products may have on<br>driving<br>ability so you kind of get on both ends<br>there Malcolm In addition Malcolm has<br>been pointed to the medicines safety<br>assessment advisory committee which has<br>been particularly active in the last two<br>years as the co pandemic in uh has been<br>in in full swing and we' considered the<br>provision provisional consent for<br>vaccines and drug therapies for SARS Co<br>2<br>infections finally Malcolm's work on the<br>role of drug metabolism different animal<br>species has resulted in being asked to<br>provide ongoing advice to the Department<br>of conservation on a project around the<br>development of human piss control agent<br>agents<br>slip so Malcolm's through his expertise<br>is a shining example of the University's<br>broader mandate as research Le teaching<br>institution that adds value to The Wider<br>Society hence in this brief summary I<br>think you can clearly see why we are<br>gathered here today to make Mark<br>Malcolm's promotion to the university<br>professorum I believe that promotion is<br>richly deserved and should have happened<br>a lot earlier and I'm going to leave us<br>saying I told you<br>so<br>malcol well you haven't left me much to<br>say then Paul so which is good<br>so I I'm under very strict instructions<br>to um stick to time uh those of you<br>who've ever been to my lecture know that<br>is going to be quite a challenge um<br>switching on the microphone as my pts<br>can confirm is not one of my strong<br>points but it is<br>on uh so uh thank you for those kind<br>those kind<br>welcomes um so I'm am going to talk<br>about Tales of toxicity testing teaching<br>so the first thing I would advise as<br>I've done to um is to Joel is be very<br>careful about the title you submit<br>because it sticks you with something<br>that You' got to then talk about so let<br>get your talk then the title I think um<br>but what I do want to this this picture<br>is really about<br>my uh the way that's just the way it's<br>gone really that research teaching uh<br>and services<br>intertwined and<br>um uh as I'll show you I've tried to<br>break it up into three big lumps but um<br>good know so um it's 2023 so uh the<br>first thing you should do when you want<br>to do it anything is uh chat GPT this is<br>this as an academic director has um<br>there isn't a single meeting I go to<br>about teaching which are many where chat<br>gbt is is discussed and um so Rachel who<br>um I'll talk about later I'll mention<br>later but um is the sort of person that<br>when something is is is s uh unlike me<br>she knows very well what I'm like but<br>she well this is what you've got to do<br>let's make a start today so she did um<br>and then uh she sent me the results of<br>chat gbt so first off um bit of a blow<br>to the ego never heard of me but<br>um you know that's that's life but<br>actually um I think this hopefully this<br>will provide all of us teachers some<br>great reassurance about chat PT um that<br>uh it can just uh in the absence of data<br>real data speeds out rubbish um so um uh<br>this is complete nuted nonsense but it<br>what I thought it is actually good is it<br>does give me somewhere to try and<br>correct some<br>facts so uh is Maria here Maria this is<br>as young as I could go okay so I am the<br>youngest of three so uh this one is me<br>my little uh my I call her my little<br>sister she's older but significantly<br>smaller uh and my big brother<br>jaff uh and uh these my parents and um<br>they were both dispensing chemists which<br>in Old terms uh or new terms I should<br>say pharmacist but<br>pre-1953 or something uh dispensing<br>chemists um and uh this is my I I<br>actually found this Photograph I got<br>sent it by my my siblings uh and this<br>must be the only time my mother had time<br>to read a newspaper at work um she was a<br>very busy woman uh both parents ran a<br>Empire um I wasn't born in New Zealand I<br>was actually born in Stockton on teas um<br>and um uh Stockton is is uh in the<br>northeast of England if you're<br>particularly interested it is in County<br>Durham which makes us North ER as<br>opposed to anyone from Yorkshire or<br>South who is just a<br>southerner um and ston is uh it used to<br>be uh famous for industrial things here<br>the first passenger Railway in the world<br>nula um but now it is actually it's got<br>its own study cohort because it has the<br>highest geographical inequities uh in<br>health in England in life expectancy and<br>I just put two errors here one uh here<br>this is where uh MD tingle limited one<br>of of our shops was uh and this is where<br>I was born and went to school and uh the<br>difference basically by Crossing the the<br>railway line was approximately 10 years<br>in<br>life um so Stockton is a um it is quite<br>a uh yeah a rough place in terms of of<br>survival and just for some interest um<br>so if you go down at the West Coast<br>which if you've ever been to Stockton on<br>the west coast it's the type place you<br>don't hang around um but even down there<br>they they can live to 78 uh<br>Newcastle where in uh Stockton New South<br>Wales again 78 uh and Stockton<br>California 78 and that's despite the<br>fact that in Stockton you're you're<br>likely to be killed by sharks uh in New<br>South Wales uh in in California like to<br>be shot haven't been<br>there uh so part of the reason why life<br>expectancy is so short uh from where I<br>come from uh is is a huge part this is<br>our local Beach uh and if the North Sea<br>don't kill you then um these this is<br>British steel oh the the remnants of<br>Brit steel that's a blast furnace if<br>you're particularly interested we had to<br>learn all about those at school and in<br>the background here is is ICI uh<br>chemicals and um uh the whole place is<br>it's an industrial town which is one big<br>chemical site and that is why in the<br>center of of town which leads the river<br>mouth um life expectancy is pretty grim<br>anyway I want to live a bit longer so I<br>left as Paul has mentioned I went down<br>to Southampton um as you can see that's<br>pretty much as far as I could get<br>um uh I mean there exitor but who would<br>go to exitor exactly<br>Jeff um and certainly wouldn't head<br>north to Scotland that was um so I left<br>home with a very much uh uh been brought<br>up by two two parents in the business of<br>uh we could do anything we wanted but<br>Pharmacy um so I did bioch chemistry<br>with pharmacology I then went off to<br>Liverpool and did my PhD in<br>Pharmacology um okay so I'm going to a<br>little bit I'll I'll talk a bit about my<br>research because it has underpinned as<br>Paul's uh mentioned my teaching and then<br>the other uh roles that I undertake so I<br>did start my PhD in<br>1984 um and then uh walk straight into<br>postop which was pretty cool um and then<br>uh from that straight into a uh a big<br>welcome Grant uh program with Kevin<br>P so um unlike some people I I don't<br>look at a disease I don't actually not<br>driven to cure Aid disease um my driver<br>is to kind of understand why things go<br>wrong and to see why it wasn't<br>predicted um so I look about I'm more<br>interested in looking at a range of<br>chemicals uh musim or drugs um and<br>there's been quite a few over the years<br>um but uh as a reviewer kindly pointed<br>out<br>uh um that uh I might have a strong<br>track record on it's not excellent um I<br>do have over 90 Publications uh but<br>impact and um yeah we didn't get that<br>gr um uh and so I I thought I wouldn't<br>bore you with data I'm not going to try<br>and wow you with how we've saved the<br>world or anything like that cuz we<br>haven't um but I hopefully you'll see<br>that what I do does have some vague<br>impact uh as I've gone through so uh to<br>my PhD this is uh I I went with uh to<br>Liverpool to uh do a PhD that was<br>actually funded by at the time what was<br>ICI Pharmaceuticals PLC now astroica<br>it's a huge huge company uh it was based<br>in or is based in uh just by uh chesher<br>not not far from<br>Liverpool and they had a problem which<br>was an immune reaction to chlorexidine<br>that's a a topical antiseptic used<br>massively I mean worldwide is is just<br>massive massive use um and they had a<br>hyper sensitivity reaction in a small<br>number of patients it was predominantly<br>in Japan and so they did what a<br>pharmaceutical company does is they<br>panicked uh they threw money at it oops<br>and um uh I got a PhD uh scholarship out<br>of it so that was quite cool um they<br>didn't really know anything about it but<br>they thought it might be something to do<br>with<br>chlorination and um so I went to<br>Liverpool I started my project uh it was<br>great I got whed and dined at the uh<br>executive uh restaurant at ICI<br>Pharmaceuticals thought this is going to<br>be the life uh and then the problem<br>seemed to disappear uh as did IC um<br>willingness to willingness to engage<br>they paid the money that was trivial um<br>so I then after about 6 months had uh<br>two and a half years three years staring<br>down the barrel of changing project that<br>was anything to do with anything I<br>wanted so long as it wasn't claw hexing<br>uh so uh no Publications arising uh from<br>that um what I did do I switched and I<br>started setting up a model so um the<br>Kevin was very much into the role of<br>drug metabolism in adverse drug<br>reactions and his sort of Niche he<br>carved out was in immunological adverse<br>drug<br>reactions and um so I was a spare hands<br>so they got me to to set up some assays<br>um I set I spent about a year setting up<br>an all lier assays uh this is the days<br>before I mean it's crazy when you look<br>back this is the days before PL readers<br>so I would do a PL and then we'd have to<br>by by ey kind of guess where an ic50 was<br>so all those students I talk about<br>reason um I also got uh involved doing<br>some uh work on uh amod Quin which is an<br>antimalarial forine quinine antimalarial<br>that has been associated with uh a<br>granulocytosis and liver toxicity uh<br>that wh brought that back onto the<br>market because of chloroquin resistance<br>and very quickly the wh introduced it<br>and the wh withdrew it because these uh<br>toxicities they were thought to be<br>immunological uh and so I did a we bit<br>to work on that as<br>well uh I did get a post do uh and I<br>have not learned once that being funded<br>by a drug company is great but actually<br>you don't get a lot out of it um I<br>walked straight into another one which<br>was funded by uh buringer Manheim uh and<br>they had got a compound that worked<br>really well in animal<br>um it gone into human and it caused<br>liver<br>toxicity so um same deal they threw an<br>awful lot of money at Kevin and he said<br>I've just got the boy uh so I started my<br>PhD uh actually before I finish writing<br>up uh finish start my bus before I<br>finish my PhD because they were very<br>very keen to get<br>started um again uh oops whoa whoa<br>whoa<br>woo take your hand away from now let's<br>see okay uh let's do that that's better<br>um I did get one publication out of this<br>uh and it was my first delve really into<br>using uh human liver uh microsome so in<br>Liverpool we set up a human liver bank<br>at the time this was the first liver<br>Bank in the<br>UK um these were uh generally obtained<br>from road traffic accidents uh where<br>they the livers were healthy but they<br>there wasn't a suitable donor so they<br>couldn't be used uh for um transplant uh<br>and we kind of would rush in with our<br>eyes book it run back to the lab chop it<br>up stick it in the minus 80 freezer and<br>then use that to investigate human liver<br>metabolism um and so I looked at having<br>looked at protein binding and the immune<br>mechanisms that i' done for my PhD we<br>look for protein reactivity as a key<br>step for uh when there should be uh<br>could be an immune response uh and I<br>started looking to see if there was any<br>direct<br>toxicity um and that set me on the way<br>for I guess quite a long time for<br>looking at as Paul mentioned<br>metabolites uh toxic metabolites and all<br>those other things that I apparently<br>Rod um and we start to look at species<br>so we had human livers but then we could<br>get mice and rats and we could show that<br>um that that that funding finished it I<br>spent three years being paid for by<br>buringer uh on several projects uh and<br>got one publication out of it um which<br>is not the best way to start a postto<br>career people um but the money is good<br>so you take your choices um we moved on<br>to welcome Grant and and Mike Coleman<br>came back from the states and we were<br>supposed to be working on Amad daquin<br>and uh and marerials and and Mike<br>actually uh came back from the states<br>he'd been working on dapson which is<br>well is an an malarial of sorts um but<br>uh he figured it was a better bet than<br>working on idiosyncratic drug reactions<br>where it might happen in one in 100 or<br>one in a thousand people um why would we<br>waste our time doing that when we could<br>work in a drug that causes toxicity in<br>sense Michael was a that person so um he<br>he we we came up together that that this<br>idea we could<br>inhibit the metabolism of the dapsone<br>which was associated with toxicity Mike<br>did it in predominantly in the rats uh<br>and I did with the human<br>microsomes because that was my bag uh so<br>we wor Mike and I worked together for<br>many years um banging through a whole<br>lot of stuff which I really don't want<br>to bore you with um but the thing I want<br>to just say is that we having started in<br>rats and got to to human livers and Shan<br>it worked in Vivo and in animal models<br>we then actually moved into humans so um<br>I did a study with Dermatology Clinic so<br>dapsone is a very uh it's a very old<br>drug uh it is occasionally used in<br>malaria it's occasionally used in<br>leprosy it's also used in this uh<br>condition called dermatitis pedoph foris<br>and the patients who have that have this<br>like uncontrollable itching they take DS<br>on and it just dampens down the response<br>and so these guys can actually these<br>people guys sorry I apologize n uh these<br>people can actually um get through the<br>day without ripping their skin trying to<br>rip their skin off the downside is that<br>they're taking a drug every day that's<br>causing adverse effects and the major<br>effect with this is met hemoglobin emia<br>oxidation of the fe2 to fe3 for those<br>three or six students will remember um<br>and it causes lethargy and headaches and<br>so they actually end up just sort of<br>sitting they're not scratching<br>themselves but equally they're not<br>really Keen to do too much uh so we<br>moved into these patients we did a study<br>and as you can see we we managed to<br>decrease their headaches uh quite<br>marketly um there's two things which<br>again just point out you know with<br>students we talk about statistical<br>significance all the time but there's<br>biological significance uh these<br>patients just thought this was the best<br>holiday they'd ever had because they had<br>um essentially nearly two weeks without<br>without feeling totally lethargic and a<br>headache constant just dull headache uh<br>so it was really great to actually chat<br>to some real people I'd only done either<br>human liver or rats up to that point and<br>mice uh to taught some real people who<br>got some real benefit and we could show<br>that that was uh there was inhibition of<br>the in Hydrox silation uh which was the<br>pathway that was causing toxicity uh and<br>actually we got an increase in the drug<br>levels and that actually meant they got<br>better therapy so they got kind of<br>better therapy with less adverse effects<br>they were super happy um lesie rods who<br>was the dermatologist who who um LED<br>this particular study then just became<br>like<br>some person going around all around the<br>world telling every dermatology<br>conference that uh everyone should be<br>put on cadine if on dapson not sure it's<br>happened but I think it's still practice<br>in Liverpool even if it's just for a<br>holiday um so Boy by the success of<br>inhibit in there in Hydrox silation uh<br>at the time yeah you got to remember I'm<br>very old uh that we sort of working on<br>the principle there's more than one p450<br>now uh and so we explored<br>um which p450 might be doing it whether<br>we could come up with a better inhibitor<br>than than sman uh and so Helen Gill was<br>a PhD student with Kevin uh and myself<br>and actually we show that uh that there<br>were two Cy Chon p450s uh 2c9 and 3 A4<br>that were involved and at the time<br>everyone said it was CP 34 was a major<br>uh enzyme involved and we were able to<br>show that actually it's got a much<br>higher CM um it's got a much bigger Vmax<br>but it's got a higher cm and so actually<br>at clinical levels uh it's not the<br>enzyme that everyone thought was that's<br>operating uh we want to do more studies<br>um and I went back into humans uh when<br>you working on things you get these<br>these papers oh dapson is do because<br>it's dose dependent met<br>hemoglobinemia um and I couldn't<br>actually find some real evidence for<br>that so I made some so uh this is uh it<br>was an N of one and I know the problems<br>of doing an N of one um but uh I took 50<br>milligrams of dapsone and I measured my<br>met hemoglobinemia I took 100 milligrams<br>of dapson repeated it did 200 uh I was<br>planed to take 400 uh I was up up for it<br>but actually um the clinical<br>pharmacologist in who was whose ethics<br>this was uh refus point blank to give me<br>the 400 I have to say this this number<br>of clinicians in the literature it says<br>met hemoglobin levels about 20% are<br>acceptable okay that's what clinicians<br>think uh 8% o um I would describe it as<br>one of the worst hangovers you've ever<br>had um and then you truly understand my<br>patients who had met him glob nemia of<br>15 20% why they felt so rubbish<br>anyway having um established uh that we<br>could get toxicity and it was do<br>dependent um I went back to looking for<br>species<br>differences uh in part why why did I do<br>this because we wanted to look at<br>analoges and we wanted to see we wanted<br>a good model to to<br>study um and so I worked with I had uh<br>uh Rosa uh a PhD student came over from<br>malasia she came over to do a PhD with<br>us uh what do I want to show you on this<br>one uh um we could show that in several<br>volunteers at 100 milligrams we could<br>get nice uh met hemoglobinemia uh it's<br>about 4% the 100 milligrams uh and that<br>was reflected by the concentration of<br>dapson that we could measure in their<br>plasma which fits with uh the toxicity<br>the interesting thing was when we went<br>and looked at uh I went and looked at<br>rats and<br>mice um we knew that meim globally was<br>caused in rats cuz Mike had done loads<br>of studies but he'd done all his studies<br>in male rats cuz that's just what the<br>animal unit gave him uh and it turned<br>out that was quite lucky because had he<br>done had he got female rats he would<br>have got no toxicity uh and so it turns<br>out with dapsone in the rat there is a<br>massive species uh sex difference that<br>uh male rats toxicity female rats no<br>toxicity and as it turned out mice no<br>toxicity<br>either um we could show that that wasn't<br>related to the concentrations in the<br>plasma of the circulating drug it's not<br>a pharmacokinetic problem uh it was<br>something<br>else um I looked at uh the sensitivity<br>of the red cells uh to the toxic<br>metabolite which we've made uh and<br>actually humans are the most sensitive<br>human cells uh and there's no real<br>difference between male and female rats<br>or mice so it isn't that the cells are<br>more sensitive it was that they are<br>making more or less of the metabolite<br>and we could show that uh that actually<br>male rats really crank forward the in<br>Hydrox silation uh and didn't do a<br>reverse reaction female rats didn't<br>really do the forward reaction but they<br>did the reverse reaction about the same<br>rate uh and mice again uh didn't really<br>do the forward reaction but actually was<br>capable of of the re reverse reaction<br>and so actually really quite protected<br>so um picking your species not just your<br>species but your sex<br>important uh so we then went on we<br>looked to C the part of the reason for<br>doing that was to look at chemical<br>substitution on toxicity that's actually<br>what the welcome Grant was about um so<br>we did a couple of papers on<br>testing uh I mentioned along the way I<br>got um a test validated so so of um this<br>was uh an initiative set up in<br>1980s to promote invitro alternatives to<br>animal testing and these guys contacted<br>me and said could you give us the<br>details of your tests and then they I<br>navely said yeser then they put me<br>through a validation process which<br>turned out to be quite a lot of work but<br>it did mean that I got a protocol out of<br>this uh which looks at the generation of<br>toxic metabolites by human liver<br>microsomes towards primary human white<br>cells and red cells um uh and so that<br>was quite cool for me um I had also done<br>some work with amine which is what I was<br>supposed to be doing and um I used to<br>get blood so so we'd use primary human<br>cells so you'd give blood so that's why<br>I have a nice scar all down my arm um<br>and you'd separate out the the monocytes<br>we're using as a Target and the red<br>cells and I was thrown Away granular<br>sites so I thought I could do something<br>with them and then I showed that<br>actually we could use those as the<br>target for drug toxicity but also to<br>show that they could metabolize drugs um<br>and that might be associated with drugs<br>that cause a granular cytosis such as<br>amine and because of the dapsone um and<br>interestingly when you you work in a<br>compound we trying to reduce the<br>toxicity uh chemically um and we thought<br>we got there but that of course was we<br>were looking for met hemoglobinemia and<br>then we realized that some of the the<br>best compounds I.E with the least met<br>hemoglobinemia we actually uh in the<br>literature is mut highly mutogenic if<br>not carcinogenic so um we then said well<br>okay if we're going to make novel analog<br>so um I got a a grant uh and Andrew<br>Wilson a technician he set up um and as<br>say where we would take again primary<br>human cells and uh we'd incubate them<br>with human liver perhaps primary human<br>liver and look for the uh formation of<br>genotoxic aites um I was I was sort of<br>spurred to do this by the as tests which<br>was the is the classic inv vitro uh<br>mutogenic I say that uses rat liver and<br>bacteria as a Target I thought we could<br>do better than that um the m test is<br>still around the tingle genotoxicity<br>test never really got it off the ground<br>but I've got a couple of<br>Publications uh and so uh that was took<br>me up to about 1997 um the head of<br>department at the time in 1996 uh was<br>actually from Liverpool he came to<br>Liverpool to the department he went to<br>the head of Department in Liverpool and<br>said we've got a job going you got<br>anyone in mind and um so aliser I think<br>in probably a peak or second said I have<br>just the man for you and um and so I was<br>dispatched to uh to Oakland with the um<br>uh Marie was happy and I think Breen<br>Ridge was quite happening too um I was<br>interviewed uh by video F by a video<br>conference by Mark and James back in<br>this was like a video call was I think<br>one of the first this University you had<br>ever done it was the first time I'd even<br>heard of it um and of course we were<br>completely different time zones it was<br>quite bizarre but as it happens Paul um<br>the interview happened just after the<br>old blacks had beat in South Africa and<br>uh die die die die I can't remember name<br>now um was a massive rugby fan<br>and the interview went my way completely<br>when she<br>said what do you think of the old blacks<br>beat in the spring<br>box I OB Scar the right answer so there<br>you go I was off of the job um Marie<br>made a whole lot of promises um and the<br>reality turned out to be slightly<br>different I<br>arrived Halfway Around the World um and<br>I was put in the Wallace block now the<br>Wallace block for those of you who are<br>young<br>not ancient was an old building that um<br>was<br>deemed not earthquake proof and so was<br>condemned it was emptied Murray had a<br>new staff member Murray did not have<br>space for his new staff member so I<br>ended up on the sixth floor of the<br>Wallace<br>block oops I'm doing it again uh the<br>sixth floor of the the the Wallace block<br>um and uh as you can see see uh there<br>was nothing in it I turned up uh it had<br>been gutted because it was a condemned<br>building because it was a condemned<br>building actually we couldn't even get<br>it decorated because the university<br>wouldn't pay to decorate a condemned<br>building so uh Chris the r uh Linda<br>stubs uh faras who was the pharmacology<br>teacher technician at the time and<br>myself uh spent several weeks actually<br>just painting the room uh this lab muray<br>had this great thought that this would<br>be my research lab and also the teaching<br>laboratory for the tox course um I<br>arrived on May we arrived May the 2nd I<br>think uh and the first iteration of the<br>course started on July the 20th so I not<br>only had to design a course from scratch<br>in terms of lectures I also had to paint<br>the lab order all the equipment uh and<br>design the the the labs uh that would be<br>in there um but there are a few people<br>retel yeah uh someone yeah who um took<br>her tox course over there um it was kind<br>of fun it was it was um it was a sort of<br>place that uh when the labs finished I<br>didn't feel too guilty about having a<br>beer with the students whatever because<br>there was no one to tell us off quite<br>literally uh the other good thing about<br>this was the America's Cup the sixth<br>floor of the Wallace block had a<br>fantastic view of uh the America's Cup<br>in<br>1997 um if for those younger people<br>where the Wallace block is yeah that's<br>road um so I I just I get this point<br>just to thank uh a couple of people<br>really uh Mark and James Paxton who took<br>me under their wing um uh Mark as you<br>can see VB he'd spent some time in<br>Australia so we'll we'll forgive him<br>that um but Mark had a uh Mark and James<br>had a great attitude to<br>science uh that involved apart from<br>anything else making sure that we went<br>fun uh I started again pretty much doing<br>lots of compounds uh IQ not drug but<br>that was Lynn Ferguson who was great<br>when I arrived uh she agreed to give<br>some lectures for me um and she got me<br>dmxaa Mark with SATA platin<br>from there um lots of different<br>compounds with acsc the little bit with<br>uh metabolism thalidomide and analoges<br>with l m Brian CB 1954 Bill Wilson uh<br>and a couple of other SN compounds and<br>23862<br>um uh norid was work with landare that's<br>a pesticide they were trying to develop<br>a species selective pesticide and same<br>with Pap they're trying to develop a<br>species selective so they don't kill the<br>birds they kill the rats the mice uh PR<br>quanal really left field that was I<br>found someone walking down the corridor<br>at pharmacology he was from SPS and he<br>was doing PR quantal in Kingfish and he<br>dosed the king fish and they died so<br>they said you need to talk to Malcolm um<br>and so we did a project looking at the<br>metabolism and toxicity of PR quantal<br>inking fish for<br>aquaculture uh which is quite cool<br>um and then uh all the time there was<br>all in animals wouldn't have taken any<br>of those compounds not chance um and<br>then a guy wanted along uh Bruce Russell<br>who was best in pharmacy at the time uh<br>and he wanted to do some work on<br>metabolism and kinetics of party pills<br>uh so BP tfmp again for you youngsters<br>they were legal right you could<br>literally and we did literally walk down<br>to the dairy you could buy the party<br>pills we bring them back to the lab we<br>can analyze<br>them uh then moved on S in I'll talk<br>about s in and<br>closing uh so there many uh<br>collaborators they're not uh and so I<br>put this up here just to acknowledge<br>that there is uh lots of people you know<br>people even more recently with people<br>like Richard Douglas surgeon<br>um uh and I'm not going to talk I don't<br>have time uh and lots of phds Masters<br>and honors who I'm don't have time to<br>talk about them so I just what<br>to I just don't cuz it's not that<br>interesting<br>right low impact I um I just want to<br>talk about uh the pharmac kinetics of<br>the partic PS so these you literally<br>could go and get them from the dairy but<br>no one had ever done anything on them<br>there was no kinetics there was no<br>safety data there was nothing someone in<br>China made them someone in New Zealand<br>took<br>them um so uh Bruce and I got a PhD<br>student oana um um and the project was<br>basically look at the metabolism and the<br>kinetics of these party pills um uh the<br>the great thing about this is again bit<br>of good old days uh before you set up an<br>analytic assay you really need some real<br>world samples if you're going to do a<br>Pharm code kinetic thing you need to<br>know what times you might choose<br>otherwise you might miss it uh so Bruce<br>took tfmpp I took<br>bzp um uh with ethics approval and uh um<br>and that is where we inadvertently<br>discovered that uh both of them are CP<br>2d6 substrates and that Bruce is a CP<br>2d6 Pool metabolizer because he he<br>absolutely tripped<br>out um I on the other hand uh could not<br>stop<br>talking till about 3:00 in the morning<br>it was just it was bizarre anyway we did<br>do the studies uh we could show that it<br>was it the the metabolism we did the<br>kinetics of that uh and if importantly<br>we should that they interacted with each<br>other and that was important because<br>these drugs were quite often taken<br>together so um it was it was really<br>important to establish that we did a lot<br>more work it got more difficult because<br>the the fun police actually made these<br>drugs illegal whilst we were in the<br>middle of working on them so they got<br>scheduled uh the misuse of drugs act uh<br>which made it a little bit trickier to<br>do<br>things uh then I just Natalie I said I I<br>have a picture of you so here it is um<br>the next p was was some s in just very<br>briefly um this was uh Natalie and and<br>Chris Bolen in particular driving uh to<br>get scientis registered as a lowcost<br>smoking Association product um and it it<br>had been used in the Eastern Europe for<br>many many years with a really really<br>really crazy dosing schedule uh and it<br>wasn't approved in New Zealand and there<br>was no pharmacokinetic data there was no<br>metabolism data no one had ever measured<br>it in people before<br>so um welcome to sui uh Jen and I took<br>on sui uh as a PhD student uh and her<br>first subject uh again we needed a real<br>sample so um you know I as a as a<br>supervisor I do many things for my<br>students but I have on occasion had to<br>give them my urine and say measure<br>that uh and so sui uh actually first<br>person in the world to to identify this<br>compound in human metrices uh to do the<br>um to show that it was in urine and also<br>importantly the fact that it isn't<br>metabolized and so it's totally renally<br>eliminated uh we then went on did<br>several studies uh the kinetics look at<br>that Jacky what a beautiful straight<br>line right um we we did a single dose in<br>healthy uh young people really tight<br>data we did it in real people uh smokers<br>who were taking the who volunteered to<br>take the drug over their normal time<br>course<br>uh and then we modeled it and we oh well<br>actually we could get the same sort of<br>profile the same concentration or Au if<br>we gave it a different dosing regimen<br>that was more rational might improve uh<br>compliance uh and so we designed a<br>fourth study where we do different doses<br>different times but given the same total<br>daily dose uh we ended up abandoning<br>that uh study for a number of reasons<br>but one of the major reasons was a<br>pharmaceutical company basically picked<br>it up and R with it so Natalie<br>introduced us to the people that achieve<br>Pharmaceuticals uh I think was it in<br>Florence or Seattle and Seattle and uh<br>they were really Keen to sit down and<br>talk to me which is great uh and then<br>they they do that and they're still<br>going and Natalie's still going with<br>this and next year natal we'll be<br>hearing about it right nice uh on to my<br>last uh bit of research Cline because<br>I'll run out of time um this came about<br>with uh forensic pathologist over the<br>the hospital<br>um who was seen a lot of people to his<br>mind a lot of people uh who were dead on<br>clbe they were young they tended to be<br>Mario Pacifica uh and they had a lot of<br>co-morbidities<br>something Cline the major concern is a<br>granal<br>cytosis it's been known it came onto the<br>market in the late '70s it was withdrawn<br>because of a granular cytosis it came<br>back on because it's a brilliant drug<br>for um cytosis but it has its<br>life-threatening uh risk<br>gastrointestinal hypo uh hypomobility is<br>also uh uh a grave concern and the first<br>thing we did we got a a student Brandy<br>bisma who was vinton's partner and she<br>did a uh review of the the data in in<br>the Oakland District Health Board and we<br>actually found that cardiotoxicity was<br>more pronounced than either a granular<br>cytosis or the hypermobility uh and so<br>it was really by high frequency is just<br>is not being reported but when you went<br>look po Brandy who was a an analytical<br>person spent months just going through<br>patient<br>records uh the mechanism was thought to<br>be an immune mediating well I did that<br>for my PhD so I knew all about that uh<br>and I've spent I think the last four<br>years trying to prove to people that it<br>absolutely is not an immune reaction um<br>which is a bit bit of paradox um Finton<br>we want to use postmortem and we we<br>actually hit a Minefield um the because<br>if you die of suicide or uh which a lot<br>of these people do it's automatically<br>refer to the coroner it's under the<br>coroner act the coroner act does not<br>allow you to take tissue for research it<br>can only be taken for the purposes of<br>the coronial investigation but we wanted<br>those samples um and so we entered into<br>a dialogue uh actually with the uh all<br>of the uh coroners of New Zealand uh and<br>actually this I put this paper up it's<br>probably my least cited paper ever and<br>it always will be and that's okay uh but<br>it was my most difficult I mean I had to<br>sit in a room with 12 coroners to try<br>and explain what we wanted to do and how<br>we wanted to negotiate the difference<br>between the coroners act which says we<br>can't have the tissue and the human<br>tissue actor says we can have have the<br>tissue if we get consent because clearly<br>these people are dead they can't give<br>consent and so working with the coroners<br>very very closely we came up with a A<br>pathway uh to do that which was<br>great um turns out the experiment wasn't<br>that exciting the hypothesis wasn't<br>great the hypothesis that these people<br>would have problems with metabolism<br>turned out not to be the case um and<br>actually the people who got<br>cardiomyopathy uh weren't remarkably<br>different from from others there were a<br>couple of other things that I'll just<br>point out that again low impact didn't<br>even publish it um the coroner the chief<br>coroner want to know the outcome of our<br>study and in talking to uh Finton in<br>particular<br>um it became apparent that several<br>coronial cases had concluded suicide<br>where actually it wasn't suicide and<br>that it was probably postmortem<br>redistribution and so uh the chief<br>coroner himself applied to the attorney<br>general to reopen some cases and<br>actually they got overturned and so two<br>families thought their kid had committed<br>case um we moved into the living which<br>uh don't ever work with<br>psychiatrists um again we we we thought<br>it was a change in metabolism and and it<br>uh was the Cline going to the end uh des<br>meile and we set up this most ridiculous<br>ambitious prospective<br>study where um we recruited patients but<br>they couldn't be recruited because they<br>weren't controlled so they couldn't give<br>consent so we had to get their<br>samples then when they were stabilized<br>on the drug we could then ask seek their<br>consent and only if they gave consent<br>then could we use their samples and if<br>they didn't have consent we had half a<br>freezer full of samples that we had to<br>throw away it was just crazy crazy crazy<br>uh and again it didn't really show what<br>we thought it would<br>show but um what we did find is that uh<br>the an oxide metabolite actually was<br>Associated uh in those patients who went<br>on to develop my carditis their an oxide<br>level just went up and up and up and up<br>up um and so this uh this is work we<br>we're still working trying to work out<br>what's going on but it looks like the an<br>oxide no one measures it actually<br>bizarrely enough they measure it they<br>don't report it they measure the the<br>drug and the primary metabolite<br>desmethyl um and so hopefully if we can<br>get more of this done we'll try and get<br>them to actually measure the metabolite<br>which might be important to predict the<br>toxicity uh just to kind of finish off<br>the research part um that's led to more<br>work uh y cardiac versus uh other tissue<br>toxicity so alen uh under joint<br>supervision with with KT Burns has been<br>looking at individual p450s individual<br>enzymes that I've been looking at for 20<br>OD years uh there are different<br>expressions in different tissues and uh<br>what Ellen has been able to show is that<br>different p450s do the the forward<br>reaction the reverse reaction and<br>different reactions at different km<br>different different affinities different<br>rates uh and actually perhaps the ones<br>in the heart are driving more of this<br>reactive oxygen species formation that<br>is driving the cardiotoxicity so again<br>not immune<br>mediating uh and now we've got uh so<br>Ellen uh Philip has just finished her<br>Masters um she started looking at<br>Transporters uh Brandy obviously is<br>looking at Patients Sam Allen is looking<br>at interactions with valpar which is a<br>major risk factor for CLP induced cardio<br>myopathy my carditis and Amanda is doing<br>a a really super neat uh study so I'm<br>working with physiologists for the first<br>time in my life um and we're using<br>primary uh cardiac tissue so the<br>tracula and we are now put it the idea<br>is put Cline and valpro on and see if we<br>can damage primary heart tissue uh and<br>look at the metabolism look at the<br>uptake and all that kind of stuff so<br>quite<br>good all right very quickly then uh<br>toxicity test and teaching so I did get<br>my Lector ship I have been doing some<br>consultancy um through un Services which<br>has paid for a lot of This research<br>because I publish in low impact journals<br>and who wants do<br>that um and uh and I also ended up on a<br>animal Ethics Committee because if you<br>work with animals<br>um Murray thought it'd be good for my<br>career so I just want very briefly the<br>animal Ethics Committee um I was a<br>member I was put on it in 19 99 I think<br>James stepped down Mark and I were on it<br>for a while together and then Mark<br>stepped down right<br>um and then I I gradually got grumpier<br>and grumpier so uh the dvcr made me uh<br>the chairperson in 2005 told me to sort<br>it out at the same time as I took over<br>the chairmanship um Justine Stewart was<br>appointed as the first animal welfare<br>officer for the University she came from<br>a compliance background which was just<br>music to my ears<br>um uh that she want to really uh check<br>really what people were really doing uh<br>I mentioned to Liz that I was going to<br>talk about AC and and she was a bit s<br>blanched that I might put some some uh<br>comp compliance monitoring in um I've<br>only got one photograph uh and it's<br>pretty<br>distasteful um but we were able to do<br>this with some really it required some<br>really good support of a couple of<br>members uh so Frank uh and Mark in<br>particular uh provided the beer and the<br>sustenance to get us uh to do this and<br>this was the first time the university<br>had actually gone out and looked at what<br>members of the University were actually<br>doing with animals we' only just sat in<br>a room previously and gone yeah you can<br>do it or don't do it but uh it was<br>really good uh Justine wrote this up uh<br>and it got published uh uh on a n<br>occasional<br>paper which actually set the goal<br>standard for not just New Zealand but<br>the world for post approval<br>monitor um I was appointed to the<br>national animal ethics advisory<br>committee in 2013 which was an<br>interesting time there was uh an A bill<br>sorry uh which was trying to ban some<br>animal testing uh and using vual<br>Alternatives I kind of knew a little bit<br>about that so it was good we spent a<br>couple of years working on that and that<br>uh some of those changes didn't get<br>through the Animal Welfare Amendment act<br>thank<br>goodness uh after that then uh Anya<br>there you go picture of you uh anyna is<br>um a two of the force uh she's uh works<br>at the SPCA and her bread and butter is<br>Animal Welfare uh she's amazing um and<br>so uh for the next sort three years we<br>had a really heavy heavy uh pressure on<br>uh the national advisory committee to up<br>the game across the whole country um in<br>terms of monitoring and compliance using<br>Justin's paper as a as a gold standard<br>um to we've changed the code of ethical<br>conduct uh that every organization that<br>on takes research testing and teaching<br>in New Zealand uses they have to use one<br>which is fully enough based on the<br>University of Oakland one that we<br>drafted I drafted years earlier uh we<br>improved the good practice guide and um<br>and then we started on MPI itself and<br>how they were actually approving these<br>things uh again as Paul's mentioned I<br>was on the R psychoactive substances<br>don't worry I'll be finished Mark um<br>this was again<br>2013 uh and this was a build to<br>revolutionize how New Zealand dealt with<br>psychoactive substances and instead of<br>scheduling them as illegal then it was<br>like yeah God have some fun but make<br>sure you do with a safe drug um so that<br>was really interesting and again it a<br>lot of it was what is a safe drug so uh<br>we were charged by uh Peter dun who was<br>the uh associate minister of Health to<br>look at toxicity testing in vro<br>Alternatives they wanted absolutely<br>animals um and that became the law so<br>2013 that became the committee we I got<br>up to gold gold uh status with a New<br>Zealand I was going down to Wellington<br>so often which is quite cool but uh that<br>became the law uh and then some<br>brilliant misinformation uh which is<br>worthy of trump um that uh uh there were<br>the protest down Queen Street Etc um and<br>that they people's dogs would be ripped<br>off the street and they'd be killed in<br>an ld50 test and it didn't matter how<br>many times I told the media that well<br>ld50 test is illegal and you wouldn't<br>use dogs anyway and um and the number of<br>dogs used in New Zealand for research<br>test and teaching was<br>about couple hundred a year and or city<br>council puts down about 3,000 a year<br>because of owners s not treating their<br>dogs properly not an issue but never<br>mind Great Piece of misinformation uh<br>and the government essentially did a<br>about turn and they banned uh the<br>committee that I was on from taking into<br>account any animal experiments to to<br>determine that compound was safe so uh<br>you could use a compound you could use<br>animals to demonstrate the compound was<br>not safe the committee could take that<br>into account but we could couldn't say<br>we couldn't take it into account to say<br>it was safe<br>politics um this is just reviewed by the<br>ministry as standard practice after uh<br>an act is introduced uh and even the<br>Ministry of Health concluded that uh the<br>government's second piece of legislation<br>effectively stopped the first piece of<br>legislation working and that is is<br>absolutely the case there's not been a<br>single application to the expert<br>advisory committee because they cannot<br>it um right just oh nearly there um must<br>get must going to die uh lockdown so uh<br>amongst lockdown I got approached by the<br>Ministry of Transport uh and asked to be<br>on this independent expert panel on drug<br>driving and uh this was for roadside<br>testing so a completely different type<br>of testing for<br>me um and it was to specify limits uh in<br>the<br>law uh and so uh because we had nothing<br>else to do p teach um so we banged out a<br>report the government uh cabinet<br>accepted it in full uh our our uh<br>recommendations which was pretty cool um<br>and it covers things from amphetamines<br>cocaine GHB MDMA meth methamphetamine<br>THC but it also covers the<br>nonprescription use of things like uh<br>opioids and uh B of dping so uh we had<br>to do this very nuanced thing that if a<br>patient is legit legitimately taken a<br>drug and they may be drowsing that might<br>impair their D driving that actually<br>isn't an offense under this um it's an<br>offense to be driving uh like that but<br>you won't they won't be done on their<br>drug level uh so actually a defense is<br>producing a valid<br>prescription uh that new once was missed<br>in the in the news the media and<br>actually<br>paradoxically lost on um the minister<br>who' initiated this request but never<br>mind that's I threw something at TV the<br>the night that uh<br>uh the Genta came on TV and said I don't<br>know why we did it um it it should make<br>Drive in New Zealand safer uh looking at<br>the the stats which I got from ESR uh<br>New Zealand is crazy crazy um<br>methamphetamine and uh THC and driving<br>so um it's it's all<br>good um I also got on to medsafe uh Med<br>safe committee M when I stepped down<br>from nyak I thought it'd be good for me<br>to learn about something might be useful<br>for my teaching<br>um and it was very boring it's like the<br>most boring committee I'd ever been on<br>for two years uh up until uh February<br>2020 because of Co and um and they used<br>to have maybe one meeting a year in 2019<br>uh sorry 2020 there were no meetings uh<br>and now we've had 14 in in two years<br>right and it's um but it's been highly<br>highly highly uh educative for me uh so<br>it's been really<br>good um I was was actually brought here<br>to teach I was brought I was given three<br>courses to direct um and um I put this<br>in request they go jams um I basically<br>taught I had a course and I asked the<br>department what did they want me to<br>teach about and they said ah whatever<br>you<br>want so um I talk about what I what I'd<br>learned so and I came up with this<br>jigsaw and the idea was every lecture<br>you get you know I get asked for<br>learning objectives and I would say well<br>today we're going to look at this piece<br>of the jigsaw<br>and that was it and it drove them mad um<br>and then at the last lecture I the idea<br>was to bring the jigsaw together so um I<br>did that and over the time I've been<br>here I brought in ethics I brought in<br>Animal Welfare I brought in legislation<br>I brought in um uh how to get uh drugs<br>registered in fact medical devices<br>because I do quite a bit for a local uh<br>company that does medical<br>devices um just for uh teach in uh the<br>the BC uh The Faculty of science decided<br>to change their um their BC in<br>2017 and that was just after Paul<br>mentioned I I became head of department<br>so I used uh some of my core skills that<br>I apparently have as a a head of<br>Department um so Paul's got us all on uh<br>going to a leadership course uh to look<br>at ourselves and see how we do for<br>I I I had a very short conversation with<br>on my oneon-one conversation with the<br>person um they just sort of said oh not<br>really worth talking about and trying to<br>change you really um but I'd like to<br>think um uh I argued quite a bit with my<br>skepticism um and um yeah my<br>interpersonal sensitivity needs a bit of<br>work as uh as the uh when I became<br>academic director the ptfs of the school<br>can thoroughly attest to<br>anyway we did resign the degree uh the<br>major pharmacology I we we kind of split<br>it into three core courses and a<br>Capstone course and it was centered<br>around getting the drug to Market so<br>getting into first inhuman trials the<br>safety evaluation you have to do the<br>kinetics you have to do the phod<br>Dynamics understanding that uh and then<br>applying<br>it um I worked with Rachel and Leslie<br>and organized people uh they came up<br>with this incredibly detailed timeline<br>of how it would all work and we would<br>transition from five courses to four<br>courses but they were different courses<br>uh and as you can see it's a beautiful<br>thing uh of course the thing to note was<br>that was q1<br>2020 uh where we in theory uh didn't<br>have time to worry about transitioning<br>from two courses to one it was about<br>delivering the courses we already had<br>but I'm going to say team they did a<br>brilliant job we banged it on the head<br>uh we delivered it on time uh and really<br>well done so just to really finish off<br>just to thanks uh that was a huge effort<br>by the whole uh Department uh these are<br>some of them um I put Kavita up front<br>and center um I have to say as the head<br>of Department that uh someone like<br>Kavita is brilliant um so any pay rise<br>you can give her Bruce uh she more than<br>deserves it she knows everything if she<br>doesn't know it she knows the person who<br>does know it um uh and just generally<br>everyone got on board everyone has been<br>really good despite my leadership<br>personality<br>clashes um in particular I just uh huge<br>shout out to the the tutor ptfs that I<br>work with really closely uh these guys<br>allow me to go off and do the committee<br>work and the research things and they<br>keep my courses going so I I now direct<br>six courses not three please not Ross um<br>including one in Pharmacy um and these<br>guys are just just allow me to live<br>um just to really finish off I have to<br>say thanks to n otherwise I wouldn't be<br>going home<br>tonight um we uh nine grants 12 peer<br>reviewed Publications five referee<br>proceedings together 26 other works<br>three honor students seven Masters three<br>phds uh and so a bit of an apology as to<br>those uh students who have to it's like<br>having Mom and Dad bickering um and of<br>course we got two kids so just to really<br>finish off I'm just going to say um Phil<br>uh so Phil has been helping me teach the<br>importance of concentration as opposed<br>to dose to uh my undergraduate students<br>for the last 10 years ever since he<br>decided to um to do shots at a birthday<br>party and um ner and I gave him the I<br>gave him the alcohol toxicology lecture<br>the next day ner gave him the alcohol<br>pathology lecture the next<br>day um and uh and I say I uh haveed this<br>slide uh just to reinforce the students<br>you know body size Matters<br>okay uh Lil hopefully that is an<br>acceptable photograph um I've never<br>talked about Elizabeth in any of my<br>lectures ever<br>okay and finally just thank you all for<br>over uh Kiora uh coark mck toku in<br>NOA um hello I'm Mark mck I'm one of the<br>professors from the Department of<br>pharmacology and clinical pharmacology<br>which Malcolm<br>heads um and I've been very excited<br>about this um occasion<br>tonight so a chance to dress up and stay<br>again so as Malcolm mentioned um we<br>first met during a video conference uh<br>interview uh for uh when the when the<br>University was was uh looking for a<br>lecturer in in<br>toxicology um um uh<br>to established to a course in<br>toxicology and<br>um and the University considered malcol<br>to be an excellent candidate and<br>appointed<br>him and so I think the university should<br>be very pleased with that<br>decision uh because uh so Malcolm is not<br>only uh excelled in the role of and the<br>the expectations of uh an academic in<br>toxicology but his as we've heard<br>tonight his achievements have gone far<br>beyond that um as we've heard in your<br>inaugural lecture thank you<br>Malcolm and I think also it's been a<br>great privilege to have had Malcolm uh<br>as a friend and colleague now for over<br>25<br>years so um joined the university as the<br>one and only<br>toxicologist and I think still is the<br>University's one and only toxicologist<br>and when he arrived that raised a lot of<br>questions um so what is a toxicologist<br>or what is toxicology they<br>asked or what is a toxicologist they<br>asked is it someone who is poisonous<br>venomous or<br>toxic well maybe some are but not<br>malcome so do toxicologists really exist<br>or are they just these uh perious uh<br>fictional characters that are in the<br>everpresent TV dramas police and uh<br>medical<br>dramas um but no so as Malcolm has<br>explained uh toxicology is the<br>scientific study of adverse effects of<br>uh uh chemical substances on living<br>organisms particularly human beings and<br>um<br>toxicologists as he's also explained<br>have a range of critically important<br>roles uh in society in<br>teaching uh research and in service uh<br>on some really weighty<br>issues like the safe use of<br>medicines and product safety<br>evaluation uh Etc so in short<br>toxicologists like Malcolm aim to keep<br>us safe from those ha hazardous<br>chemical uh substances so thank you very<br>much for that<br>Malcolm um and uh thank you for your<br>lecture so Malcolm's AC academic uh<br>contributions have we have we've heard<br>have been impactful and<br>numerous um and so time allows me only<br>to highlight one or<br>two so his approach to teaching has<br>really been an Exemplar for<br>uh academic staff in<br>Pharmacology and elsewhere because he<br>has shown by example that uh teaching<br>can be done with passion and because<br>it's<br>important not just because it's<br>something to be done so you can move on<br>something<br>else uh and also uh his unwavering<br>support for professional<br>staff uh is also something that's been<br>very impactful and so he mentioned the<br>team of uh professional teaching fellows<br>in Pharmacology that uh that has been a<br>very stable team very skilled and very<br>very happy uh and they there to support<br>the teaching of<br>pharmacology uh to science students and<br>and future health professionals at this<br>University so that's been very<br>important and it's clear from our<br>everyday interactions with<br>Malcolm uh that he he uh is a very<br>respectful and kind person to others and<br>um that that humility I think is sha<br>through in his lecture tonight where<br>he's taken the care to acknowledge uh a<br>lot of people who he's interacted with<br>um um during his career to this point so<br>congratulations and thank you<br>Malcolm uh Kora Professor<br>you malcol we might get you up here just<br>to hand over this<br>uh little momento of the<br>evening and we'll have to pose for the<br>so it just leaves me to thank you again<br>all for coming I thank Malcolm for a<br>tremendous amount of work that he did<br>and shared with us this evening um uh it<br>is um we've made it all to the end so<br>there are some drinks and nibbles out<br>there which I'd like you all to um stay<br>and share with Malcolm I'm not sure<br>we're all invited to the late night um<br>but for those who are good luck um I'm<br>slightly anxious about what Malcolm<br>might take and be careful of his urine</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
