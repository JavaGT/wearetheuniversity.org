wants to take us tonight but this<br>is a great occasion of Celebration and<br>we really want to welcome you all here<br>tonight um despite the chilly of the<br>evening outside this is the right place<br>to be it's going to be warm we're going<br>to have a great lecture a great<br>celebration n's assured me that she's<br>excited for this um she's not feeling<br>nervous at all um and thereafter we're<br>going to gather for some uh uh snacks<br>and drinks and um it's just a great<br>privilege um but on a more serious note<br>to to to get to do this lecture is the<br>culmination of many many years of hard<br>work um many hours of<br>dedication um meeting high standards of<br>teaching research um what we call<br>service um and uh the application<br>process is challenging to say the least<br>um the UN the outcome<br>uncertain um and I think for many folks<br>it's often a sense of relief when you<br>actually get the yes um certainly was in<br>my case um um but it does reflect a long<br>process and a recognition of Distinction<br>to join the professorate and so nulo<br>with together with your family tonight<br>we are delighted to be able to celebrate<br>that um it's a chance for you to explain<br>to everybody what you do in your day job<br>because many people don't know um<br>especially your friends and family um um<br>Malcolm may know I'm not sure but um um<br>but we'll all get to know much better by<br>the end of the evening um so uh I'm not<br>going to talk for too much longer<br>because there's people who going to do<br>other bits and pieces so um it's now my<br>job to um allow Ellen Davidson to come<br>and formally introduce you nula and um<br>thank you again for being willing to<br>share your lecture with us tonight we<br>look forward to it in a few minutes but<br>over<br>to so greetings and welcome everyone um<br>it's good to see so many<br>uh people in the audience tonight um<br>most of you will know I'm the head of<br>n's Department the department of M<br>medicine and pathology and I get the<br>great pleasure of saying a few words of<br>introduction before nula takes the<br>podium uh so first of<br>all congratulations<br>n um being promoted to the rank of<br>professor as the dean just indicated as<br>an exceptional<br>achievement uh and it means you've shown<br>naal recognition and outstanding<br>leadership across the three pillars of<br>academic life it's teaching research and<br>service um and as it was mentioned it's<br>no easy<br>feat it often involves a torturous<br>Journey um a Meandering journey in some<br>cases uh with ups and downs and it<br>requires resilience and patience which<br>thankfully nula has been blessed um<br>tremendously with those attributes and<br>I'm glad that she<br>um H's attributes and did it there was a<br>rumor that uh she almost ended up in<br>Antarctica studying rocks I'm not sure<br>if that's part of the story or not but<br>I'm sorry if I if I po that buzz bubble<br>um so on behalf of the world's<br>pharmacogenetics Community thank you for<br>uh choosing this path and apologies to<br>geology um I'm not going to try and<br>summarize n's achievements on her<br>academic journey I will let her tell<br>that story in her own words um<br>what I will say instead and it's sort of<br>been indicated by the dean already um is<br>that I'm guessing you feeling pretty<br>nervous perhaps even horrified to be<br>here um to have the Limelight on you and<br>to stand here and I as an introvert<br>myself I can sympathize with that so I<br>just want to say please just Savor this<br>moment<br>um and soak in the kind of attention<br>marinate in the attention of your<br>achievement<br>because it's a really big one and when<br>you look at your life there aren't that<br>many moments where you can actually stop<br>particularly as an adult where you get<br>to stop and celebrate your<br>success um so you can climb to the top<br>of the mountain you can plant your flag<br>and just spend a bit of time there<br>saying yep I knocked the bugger<br>off<br>um now I'm saying this most people in<br>this room will know nula very well I'm<br>saying it because um nula is a very self<br>sacrificing person uh what I would call<br>someone who's outwardly facing so she is<br>um she's she cares very deeply about the<br>people around her uh she's a wonderful<br>Mentor very supportive Mentor for the<br>people in her group but also for other<br>members of the department she's<br>passionate about her teaching um and<br>about the student journey and very<br>Innovative in the way that she<br>teaches um bottom line is that she cares<br>and and that's what makes her a<br>delight I I picked up a saying somewhere<br>um I I I couldn't actually Source<br>exactly where I got it from but it's<br>it's this it's kindness is wisdom and I<br>spent a lot of time saying this in my<br>household actually to my teenage<br>children but um kindness is wisdom and<br>so I know we're here to acknowledge<br>nul's academic wisdom that's that's a<br>given um but I think it would be nice to<br>also acknowledge that she is doubly<br>achieved<br>in that she has already achieved a<br>second kind of wisdom uh which many of<br>us don't In Our Lifetime and she's<br>achieved it long ago most likely and<br>that's the wisdom of<br>kindness so on that note I'm going to<br>fak if knowledge is gathered<br>Enlightenment will follow so please nula<br>come up and Enlighten us on your<br>academic journey and the pathway that's<br>LED you to the success<br>T<br>moror right uh tenot tenot tenot<br>ctoa Co HBY T puki Co Mercy t<br>um<br>and<br>1997 so as I've just told you there I'm<br>uh I've told you a little bit about<br>where I'm from and I'm from this town<br>small little town H literally halfway<br>between Liverpool and Manchester in the<br>northwest of England and it's town<br>called newly Willows and it's really<br>close to the river Mery and it is<br>completely flat where I'm from because<br>it's pretty much the um the flood plane<br>of the the river Mery so there are no<br>mountains and there are no Hills except<br>for this one tiny little Hill in the<br>town of hsby and you might be thinking<br>like ah maybe that's got something to do<br>with NOA and it does a little bit so um<br>the town of hsby was established by the<br>Vikings long time ago I guess and um<br>when uh um William the Conqueror popped<br>over and beat all and defeated all the<br>the Saxons he established the very first<br>um Lord of The Manor of HBY or can't<br>even remember his name now somebody to<br>hsby and I am actually related to him<br>through this lady here down at the<br>bottom and her name is aliser HBY and uh<br>that is a photograph of her painted<br>Tombstone so I'm hoping that's the<br>oldest family photograph that you're<br>going to see in any inaugural lecture um<br>but she died in 1268 and I think that's<br>when the last time my family had<br>anything to do with the English<br>aristocracy um but as I said I'm I've<br>got Celtic Heritage and um my father is<br>from where that little tiny star is up<br>on that map there and his family haven't<br>really moved from around newly Willows<br>for probably many many centuries and my<br>mother's family are all from Ireland and<br>all our family history constantly tells<br>us that we're we're Kelts uh so I was<br>very very pleased pleased when my 23 and<br>me uh profile came back 100% kelt uh but<br>I've got quite a strong Irish cultural<br>heritage from my mother's side of the<br>family which you may have guessed from<br>my unusual name but thankfully my mother<br>didn't Lumber me with the full gelic<br>version which is Fula and as you can<br>read there there's a whole mythology<br>about Fula um and she was the daughter<br>of the king of the TW to to denan who<br>were um the kind of the fairy Folk<br>violence so you think you're little<br>leprechauns and stuff um but for some<br>reason she really upset her Mo her<br>stepmother got cursed to be a turned<br>into a Swan Flew Around Ireland with her<br>brothers for I think 900 years and then<br>when the curse was broken they were 900<br>years old and died so I never really<br>understand what were the moral of that<br>that mythology was anyhow um I've got<br>quite strong Irish heritage and I was<br>brought up on all those sort of stories<br>and that you can see me there very<br>proudly showing off my Irish dancing<br>trophies as a young girl<br>um cool now I'm from this town called<br>newly Willows and I'm quite proud of<br>being from newly Willows not um probably<br>not somewhere many of you have heard of<br>before although I think um the<br>photographer is from nearby there so<br>he's quite excited um so uh it's it's a<br>quite it's a tiny place but it's quite<br>important little place because it was<br>the last sight of the last battle of the<br>English Civil War the site of the very<br>first industrial canal in England and in<br>the opin of many Martin was going to<br>argue here the birthplace of the modern<br>passenger Railways and regardless of<br>arguments over that it's certainly got<br>the oldest passenger uh waiting room in<br>the world and also the oldest Railway<br>vict which is shown in that background<br>of that um photograph of the canal there<br>and it's got two famous people that's<br>come from from newly Willows this<br>person's really important for my<br>department so Rodney Porter who won the<br>Nobel Prize for the discover Discovery<br>of the structure of imog globulin cool<br>so very important for molecular medicine<br>and perhaps the most famous person ever<br>from newly Willows is this person let's<br>hope this<br>works about to stop any second it should<br>stop it should stop hopefully it's going<br>to stop yeah there you go um and I went<br>to school with rast he was a bit year<br>younger than me and I used to hear him<br>also practicing with his band at the<br>neighbor's house so yeah they're the two<br>famous people from newly Willows we can<br>only go up from there so the big<br>question is I guess how did this little<br>girl from newly Willows end up all the<br>way the other side of the world<br>especially when none of my family's ever<br>moved anywhere particularly um dressed<br>in this rather strange medieval Garb um<br>obviously I've got some medieval history<br>to me but not to this excuse to wear<br>this sort of um ACS so I'm the first in<br>my family to go have tertiary education<br>this is a picture pictures of me on my<br>18th birthday with my dad Jim who it was<br>a um a glass he worked in a glass<br>factory as a maintenance fitter and<br>that's my mom Joan and she was a school<br>dinner lady so for those of you are not<br>from the UK and Britain or of a certain<br>era that is a lunchtime playground<br>supervisor anyway that was my mom and<br>dad or is my mom and dad and that little<br>cutie there is my little brother Kenneth<br>and he might look like a little cutie<br>but he was a second down at black belt<br>so I never won any arguments with my<br>little brother and this is him all grown<br>up now and he's a a brick layer so I'm<br>the first person in my family to have<br>done anything as weird and wonderful as<br>uh dressing up in this sort of garment<br>and I can vividly remember when I first<br>wanted to be a scientist I was 10 years<br>old and the teacher came into the<br>classroom and said okay we' got<br>something exciting for you all today<br>boys and girls all the girls I want you<br>to walk down the corridor to Mrs<br>Gilson's class cuz you're going to have<br>sewing lessons and I thought to myself<br>hm my Granda sress I don't need to know<br>how to sew I already know how to do that<br>but lucky for all the boys you're going<br>to get to go to Mr Rigby's class and<br>you're all going to learn this very<br>special subject called science and I<br>just remember being really really peeved<br>about that so that's where it all<br>started from I think and then<br>fortunately when I went to uh senior<br>school I did have the opportunity to not<br>be a girl who's only going to do sewing<br>and I did take some science subjects and<br>um I was actually reasonably good at<br>biology and this is me demonstrating in<br>one of the biology open days for the for<br>the school um but the teachers were<br>really not sure about me I wasn't<br>exactly a academic high flyer so um they<br>made me do a whole set of exams called<br>CSE exams which are exams for somebody<br>who's going to leave school at 16 as<br>well as a whole set of exams called all<br>level exams for somebody who might be<br>staying on to do a levels and go to<br>universities so twice the amount of<br>exams because I was probably not clever<br>enough go figure anyway the only um<br>subject that they decided I really<br>wasn't clever enough to do the O Level<br>version of was English literature and I<br>was a little bit peeved about that I I'm<br>a voracious reader I read probably two<br>or three novels a week sometimes so I<br>was a bit annoyed that I wasn't going to<br>get to um learn about William<br>Shakespeare but hey peeved but move on<br>um and when I finished all my exams the<br>teachers were quite surprised because I<br>I did really quite well so they said<br>okay you can stay on and do your a<br>levels and you can choose any subjects<br>you want so I said oh well obviously<br>biology quite good at that can I do<br>English literature and their faces fell<br>and they went oh we did say you could do<br>anything you want okay you can do<br>English literature so I was like Yay<br>gonna learn about William Shakespeare um<br>and then I saw that there was another<br>subject on the the list that i' had<br>never seen before called geology and I<br>said I want to do that too and I went no<br>no no no one new subject is more than<br>enough so I couldn't do geology so I did<br>for my a levels biology English<br>literature and chemistry now that was<br>really cool because I got to write a<br>wonderful poem about a chemistry lab<br>that was so wonderful it got published<br>in the school magazine height of my<br>career um but not so good because to go<br>to my English literature classes I had<br>to skip half the chemistry classes to go<br>to the chemistry classes I had to skip<br>half the English literature classes<br>wonder what happened funnily enough I<br>didn't do spectacularly well in my a<br>levels um however I was really fortunate<br>to be able to scrape enough grades<br>together to go to go to this institution<br>which was called North Staffordshire<br>poly Technic in Stoke on Trent and look<br>what I got chance to do I finally got<br>chance to have a go at doing some<br>geology and this is me bashing some<br>rocks up in Northwest Scotland without<br>my safety hat and my uh spectacles<br>naughty nula and I RI vividly remember<br>when we were being um in the lectures<br>learning about the Oakland volcano<br>volcanic Zone which you can see there<br>and going to the other people in the<br>class who on Earth would be stupid<br>enough to live in an active volcanic<br>zone go figure anyhow when I finished my<br>degree I was really excited because I<br>thought great I want to work as a<br>geologist and at the time the only uh<br>job opportunities really well there were<br>lots of job opportunities but they were<br>only really two Fields the North Sea oil<br>rigs or the British Antarctic Survey so<br>I got you know started looking for these<br>job adverts and they were all started<br>with this sort of um uh um started with<br>the the top of the job advert saying we<br>are proud to be an equal opportunities<br>employer however Please be aware that<br>there are no showering facilities<br>available for women on these sites it's<br>just like damn peeved but move on for<br>once in your life no so I I went back to<br>the my original first love of biology<br>and tried to do um find some jobs around<br>that now I was really really fortunate<br>because I got taken on at the University<br>of Liverpool to work as a research<br>technician in a unit that was doing<br>tropical pharmacology so I'm not going<br>like I don't know what that is but I'll<br>have a go you know whever and this is me<br>in the in the research lab um again no<br>safety spectal of course but they were<br>different it was a different era in<br>those days um and I that was great A<br>Whole New World opened up to me trying<br>to work out what this thing was tropical<br>pharmacology but also I made loads of<br>friends and did lots of things that I<br>would had never done before like going<br>potholing and caving and rock climbing<br>so I just had a fantastic time when I<br>was um first working at at Liverpool but<br>the key thing that was um really fun or<br>opened up my world I suppose was I<br>published my first paper and this is the<br>paper here and it's on a drug called<br>icton and it's a drug that's used in the<br>treatment of a um a uh tropical disease<br>called on sasis or river blindness<br>because this is a drug that's used for<br>the treatment of lots and lots of<br>different uh helminthic worm infections<br>and so it's really useful for that um<br>it's also used as a veterinary medicine<br>and this is possibly one of my better<br>papers because it's still relevant is<br>still uh continuously cited because it's<br>Drug's still in use but it's even more<br>relevant because you might recognize the<br>name itin from when uh the covid-19 um<br>Panic was out there and everyone was<br>desperately thinking like oh we need to<br>find a cure um and obviously my citation<br>index went through the roof which was<br>lovely um but uh the also key thing<br>about this was this paper was being used<br>to explain to people why you could never<br>dose a person with enough of a drug to<br>achieve the concentrations you'd need to<br>cure covid-19 so kind of cool for your<br>very first paper but at the time I was<br>also working on this other drug hydroxy<br>chloroquin and Other Drugs related to<br>that and unfortunately for me and my<br>citation index um we published we didn't<br>publish that as an academic paper it was<br>a a publication a report for The Who<br>it's a bit of a shame because this guy<br>would have done wonders for my citation<br>index oh oh well anyway after uh working<br>there for a we while as a research<br>technician I did then get the<br>opportunity to be um given the the<br>opportunity to undertake a PhD and that<br>was sponsored by The Who or the World<br>Health Organization and hopefully you<br>can see me hiding as per usual trying to<br>hide when it's photograph time um uh and<br>in that photograph there and the the the<br>pharmacology department at that time was<br>one of the world leading places for<br>tropical pharmacology and it was a<br>wonderful place to work because there<br>were so many people from all around the<br>world coming visiting and working and as<br>hopefully you can see there there's<br>quite a lot of diversity of people which<br>was quite unusual way back way back then<br>last century cool so what did I do as my<br>PhD well I was doing an awful lot of<br>drug bioanalysis and you need to<br>remember this is a long time ago so it<br>was before computers practically and one<br>of the many things I had to do was hand<br>inject your samples and also by watch<br>the pen and paper to collect the data<br>and so it was a very very robotic job<br>and obviously I also didn't really know<br>very much pharmacology so I just sat and<br>I read every textbook I could whilst<br>injecting samples so I taught myself far<br>ology and these are two of my favorite<br>textbooks and they're good textbooks<br>still I think anyhow um so what did I do<br>for my PhD apart from being a robot so I<br>was working on this drug here called<br>pranal which is an antimalarial drug and<br>the key thing about this drug is it's<br>it's not active itself it's a prod drug<br>so it has to be activated in your body<br>by liver enzymes to convert it into this<br>metabolic cyc gual which has all the uh<br>antimalarial um activity associated with<br>it and the key finding I found for from<br>my PhD was this poor metabolizer trait<br>so some individuals a proportion of<br>population can't efficiently convert the<br>prod drug into the active metabolite and<br>that uh graph there shows you that's<br>about tenfold lower concentrations in<br>these people with this poor metabolizer<br>trait so then we did essentially lots of<br>classical genetics type um approaches of<br>not just identifying that trait but<br>trying to understand the prevalence in a<br>population we did The Inheritance<br>pattern it's quite straightforward<br>simple autosomal melan recessive<br>inheritance easy one uh and we were able<br>to identify the protein that was<br>involved and another thing to remember<br>this is a long time ago so it was before<br>the human genome so we were still<br>struggling to really understand what<br>genetic variant was underpinning all of<br>that but we knew it was an inherited<br>trait and this was called<br>pharmacogenetics now you may have heard<br>of this thing called pharmacogenetics<br>but I guess you're probably more likely<br>to have heard of something called<br>personalized medicine where you have<br>this idea of the right you take your<br>genomic information and you get<br>understand uh what's the right treatment<br>for the right patient so this idea of<br>getting your genome making sure you've<br>got a personalized diagnosis and then<br>maybe making a designing bespoke drugs<br>that are going to work specifically for<br>that person's uh disease but<br>pharmacogenomics has one extra little um<br>um Nuance to it because it's not just<br>about the right drug for the right<br>patient it's about the right dose too<br>and therefore taken into into account<br>also the safety of medications in this<br>idea of personalized medicine and that's<br>where all this poor metabolizer trait<br>comes in so in the context of what I was<br>working on with a prod drug if you've<br>got too low a concentration of your drug<br>sub therapeutic you're not going to have<br>an effect and in case of drugs which<br>maybe have got um a narrow therpeutic<br>index if you're a poor metabolizer then<br>the drug concentration is going to be<br>super therapeutic and it might not be<br>safe so that's kind of the context or<br>concept around pharmacogenetics<br>and I can't remember what's on the next<br>slide oh yes I know remember now for the<br>embarrassing bits so whilst I was at um<br>Liverpool I obviously um fell in love<br>with this field of pharmacology and<br>pharmacogenetics and pro drugs in<br>particular but at the time I also bumped<br>into this person<br>and I sorry Malcolm in case anyone<br>doesn't know this is Malcolm tingle<br>hiding down the front down here um and<br>uh when I first met Malcolm I really<br>really really did not like him I found<br>him<br>quite quite obnoxious and um but he used<br>to come to the lab which is pictures of<br>him there and sit and CH talked to me<br>every day and he chipped away at me and<br>eventually I gave up and I married him<br>and as you and as you can see uh typical<br>Malcolm even on our wedding day he was<br>out of his suit as fast as possible and<br>not uh not a very formal person at all<br>anyway hello malcome I I do quite like<br>you these<br>days um after working as a postto in<br>Liverpool for a few years though I did<br>take a New Journey and I moved down to<br>um the University of Birmingham in the<br>UK and I was working in the department<br>of Toxicology but also with associated<br>with the Cancer Research Institute so<br>you can guess what I've got to do again<br>massive amount of getting textbooks out<br>and lots and lots of learning but it was<br>actually quite a related thing to what<br>I've previously been doing so rather<br>being pro drugs I was now looking at<br>chemicals that were procarcinogens and<br>how they were being metabolized into<br>something that could lead to formation<br>of a a carcinogen and increased uh<br>cancer and the role of things in your<br>diet like<br>f soy derived phytoestrogens and how<br>that might be able to um moderate and<br>modulate all of that risk dietary risk<br>um which was kind of cool and um uh very<br>interesting uh but as well as doing lots<br>of uh academic Publications the cool<br>thing I I had at that time was because<br>it was being um sponsored by the min Min<br>of Agriculture fisheries and food I had<br>to do verbal and oral reports sorry<br>verbal and written reports every I think<br>it was every quarter to the minister so<br>I had a whole completely different world<br>that I was suddenly working within and<br>and learning different ways to um talk<br>to people I guess so that was kind of<br>cool new new move for me and then<br>completely out the blue for me because<br>I'd never really wanted kids I just<br>desperately wanted babies poor Malcolm<br>um these are my lovely children so<br>that's philli and Elizabeth as as a<br>little kids obviously now I obviously as<br>I've written there uh well this was a<br>long time ago so there was no maternity<br>leave and I've WR deliberately written<br>maternity rather than parental leave<br>there because I hadn't even thought of<br>about parental leave at that stage and I<br>definitely had no career plan and so I<br>did lots and lots of little mini jobs of<br>uh sh fix term sometimes research<br>technician jobs sometimes postdoc jobs<br>um and in all of that period of time as<br>well Malcolm got offered a job down here<br>in New Zealand so he moved country too<br>even though it's not on the map we<br>managed to find it um and uh very<br>fortunately after a little while here I<br>started to work in the Cancer Research<br>Center first of all working with Lyn<br>Ferguson and and related to that initial<br>work that I was doing at the University<br>of Birmingham but eventually I uh um<br>started to work in Bild Dennis chemistry<br>Group which was always interesting for<br>me because you know that problem with<br>doing English literature and chemistry<br>like chemistry isn't that great anyhow I<br>had a huge learning curve of sitting<br>through lots and lots of synthetic<br>chemistry meetings and Medicinal<br>Chemistry and learned an awful lot and<br>they are amazing people in that team um<br>and I was working again on prod drugs<br>and these Pro drugs and their ability to<br>be metabolized and converted into<br>something that's uh causes DNA damage<br>and kills cancer cells and um after a<br>wee while Bill Denny and Bill Wilson set<br>up a drug development company called<br>proactor and I think I was probably one<br>of the first employees of that company<br>and that they took the these drugs and<br>related drugs through to clinical trial<br>so again a very different working<br>environment of a drug development kind<br>of context so that was also quite<br>fascinating time and I made some lovely<br>friends and I saw Susan earlier before<br>don't she waving somewhere and Frederick<br>in particular is part of that team and<br>there were others I just couldn't find<br>everybody's photographs so hello<br>everybody from the cancer center cool so<br>what else was going on oh I<br>know fin I returned back to Academia so<br>I was very very fortunate to be offered<br>a position as a senior lecturer in the<br>department of molecular medicine and<br>pathology and in that role I deliver<br>pathology teaching to scientists and<br>also in some of the uh clinical programs<br>as well particularly the pharmacy<br>program and also pharmacogenomics<br>teaching not just in my department but<br>in multiple different uh uh programs<br>across the school and into Pharmacy so I<br>teach in lots of different courses but<br>my main course is uh um molecular basis<br>of disease um I was also and I've put it<br>up here because I don't know where else<br>to squeeze this in very briefly the<br>program director for the post-graduate<br>biomedical Sciences program which and<br>the reason that I was doing that was<br>because for many years I was the<br>postgraduate director for the school<br>School of medical sciences and we uh I<br>was part of the uh team of people that<br>did all the QA proposals Etc to move<br>that degree from The Faculty of Science<br>and into our faculty and so I stayed on<br>for a couple of years to make sure that<br>that program was fully embedded into the<br>processes within our<br>school right but there is one key person<br>I really really need to thank here and<br>that's this lady where is she I saw her<br>before I can't find her now oh there she<br>is there you go um and um I work so for<br>those of you who don't know relle is a<br>professional teaching fellow in our<br>department and she's a wonderful person<br>and I just want to acknowledge that her<br>pedagogical<br>Insight constantly makes me uh reassess<br>my thinking reassess how what I'm<br>delivering reassess how I'm delivering<br>stuff and I am extremely grateful to be<br>able to work alongside relle so cool<br>thank you so much right so obviously as<br>uh once you got an academic position<br>it's not just all about your uh delivery<br>of teaching you've also got to set up<br>your research you've got to have more<br>than one hat all the time um and so<br>what's my research uh hat I'm not sure<br>which hat but here we go so I was really<br>fortunate because I still had lots of<br>links with the Oakland Cancer Research<br>Center to be able to carry on um<br>investigating the role of drug<br>metabolism in drug development in three<br>separate different programs and I can<br>see that the three people sat all<br>together there which is really cool so<br>so I worked with Brian and his work<br>where he was developing new agents for<br>uh anti-tuberculosis drugs Julie who was<br>a leading a program to develop uh<br>immunosuppressive agents around uh<br>affecting perforin and laming who was<br>working on uh analoges of thmi for the<br>treatment of uh diseases like multiple<br>Myoma so that was a really important um<br>uh thing that I still managed to be able<br>to um add something to hopefully for you<br>guys and I thank you for being able to<br>work with you um but clearly one of the<br>things I really wanted to do was get<br>back into my pharmacogenomic type of<br>research and especially because by this<br>stage the human genome had been um<br>deciphered to some<br>extent right now to do the type of<br>research that I do around cancer<br>pharmacogenomics you really do need to<br>be able to do your work uh with uh<br>patients and with uh real people in real<br>time uh and so I won't be able to go<br>through every single project that I do<br>and I wanted to acknowledge all of these<br>different clinicians at least on one<br>page here but might mention the odd one<br>as I go through the talks um because all<br>of these people over the years have<br>patiently listened to nul's new silly<br>idea and then G oh you know actually I<br>think we could we could do that we could<br>try and deliver that and they've all<br>been wonderful people to have known uh<br>both uh in the more in the past and some<br>very recent collaborators like Nikki<br>Laurence who's somewhere out there too<br>so something and I particularly want to<br>also acknowledge Mike Finley and the<br>whole team that he developed at uh<br>cancer trials New Zealand because they<br>just amazing people too cool so what<br>just for a few minutes I want to just<br>give you a little flavor of the type of<br>research I do and I thought I'd try to<br>just um describe this thing of cancer<br>pharmacogenetics in this this kind of<br>context I want to talk first of all<br>about what happens around genetics if<br>you're looking for a drug uh the<br>genetics influence why a drug might not<br>work in some people and the genetics as<br>to why a drug might be unsafe or toxic<br>in some people so I'm going to start<br>with this one at the bottom here<br>cyclophosphomide a really widely used<br>drug you might have heard of it and I'm<br>going to talk about these two genes sip<br>2 c19 and CP 2 B6 so cyclophosphomide is<br>used for lots and lots of different<br>cancers but also used in the treatment<br>of a number of different autoimmune<br>diseases like lupus<br>nefritis and the reason why I like<br>cyclophosphomide<br>it's a pro drug so it's um has to be<br>metabolized by enzymes in your liver to<br>make this metabolic for hydroxy<br>cyclophos smide damages cells kills<br>cells kills cancer cells kills<br>excessively proliferating immune cells<br>too and what we showed right very early<br>on when I first started working on this<br>uh was working with Malcolm who had<br>developed a human liver biobank of lots<br>of different donor livers and we could<br>uh demonstrate that different uh<br>individual people had either high low or<br>medium uh ability to activate<br>cyclophosphomide and more importantly I<br>could then go genotype these uh samples<br>and we could work out the different<br>variants in those two genes CP 2 B6 and<br>CP 2 c19 and if you had a variant in<br>those genes either one of those genes<br>then that you had lower activation and<br>I've popped janak's picture in here too<br>hi J um because he's not a cancer<br>clinician but he's a a a really key<br>person because he helps me with all our<br>work around patients who've got lupus<br>nefritis where this drug is an important<br>um therapeutic<br>agent um but uh we while later we went I<br>started thinking again about this cycl<br>fosmid bioactivation and we did a really<br>small study in New Zealand breast cancer<br>patients who get treated with this drug<br>and again could show that the inherited<br>low function variance of this um either<br>CP 2 c19 or CP 2 B6 decreases your<br>bioactivation of<br>cyclophosphamide and the key thing is<br>you have to U do polygenics so you have<br>to think about the two genes to<br>understand is someone going to have low<br>bio activation at cycl fosite and the<br>reason why I wanted to come back to all<br>of this and double check whether we<br>could see this too or not there's other<br>people have been looking at it across<br>across the globe and there was an awful<br>lot of information saying this really<br>does these two genes have a therapeutic<br>outcome effect because they're not<br>bioactivating uh cyclophos if you've If<br>you inherited these<br>variants now the reason why I'm<br>mentioning all of this really I guess in<br>the New Zealand context is we know<br>there's really really big differences<br>across the globe of um the prevalence of<br>your Gene variance in all sorts of<br>different genes but for sip 2 c19 in<br>particular so for sip 2c9 if you're of<br>European ancestry probably about 3% of<br>those people will have inherited two<br>loss of function variants be poor<br>metabolizer whereas in people from Asian<br>ancestry Japanese Chinese regions of the<br>world would be more like 20 to 30% of<br>people and there was at the time I wrote<br>this review very very little um uh<br>publicly available data about Mary and<br>Pacific people but it was suggesting it<br>was going to be a lot higher there's<br>some more information now and it's about<br>20% for people of Mari and Pacific<br>ancestry unfortunately there's literally<br>no data out there on sip 2 B6 and um but<br>it is more common anyway in in people of<br>European ancest his to have poor<br>metabolism via zip 2 B6 and the reason<br>why I'm mentioning this is because we<br>did observe in people who were of<br>non-european ancestry self-identified as<br>Mario Sone Fijian Etc that they had<br>lower bioactivation of cyclopamine and<br>this seems to me like something we<br>should be uh investigating further<br>perhaps okay so up to now I have talked<br>to you about what happens if you're a<br>poor metabolizer so you're slowly<br>pedaling along and not efficiently um<br>metabolizing drugs but what about people<br>who are normal metabolizers which of<br>course is going to be typically the<br>major group of people uh in this context<br>and the reason why I wanted to mention<br>this is because of this really important<br>um uh phenomenon called pheno conversion<br>where you've got your inherited<br>predisposition your genes say you should<br>be a normal metabolizer but when we go<br>and investigate and phenotype the person<br>they are a poor metabolizer<br>now lots of people look at this sort of<br>Gene disease uh Gene environment<br>interaction but most people are looking<br>at things like co-medications and stuff<br>like that I was interested putting my<br>pathology hat on whether this was a gene<br>disease interaction and it was something<br>to do with uh downregulation of the<br>genes so um we know from lots and lots<br>of studies in healthy young usually<br>healthy individuals that that CP 2 c19<br>genotype definitely predicts your<br>metabolizer trait and years and years<br>ago I'd done a little study in patients<br>in when I was working in Liverpool in<br>patients with this disease called<br>psorasis which is a very very<br>inflammatory autoimmune disease and what<br>I had noticed at that time was there was<br>a really high prevalence about uh<br>threefold higher of people who are this<br>poor metabolizer phenotype and that the<br>severity of the disease uh so if you had<br>severe psorasis versus mild psorasis<br>about 50% of people were poor<br>metabolized<br>but this of course was before the human<br>genome so we didn't couldn't genotype<br>those patients at the time anyway so I<br>wondered if what about cancer patients<br>because we know they are a very uh<br>chronic inflammation goes on in cancer<br>so I wanted to investigate whether we'd<br>have this pheno conversion event going<br>on in cancer patients and remember this<br>is your you've got a normal metabolizer<br>genotype but when we measure your<br>function you're a poor metabolize a<br>phenotype and essentially we looked in<br>lots of different patient groups in lots<br>of different context and no matter where<br>we looked we could observe this poor<br>metabolizer fena conversion and it's<br>about 25% of people and we did a bit of<br>work trying to tie down what might be<br>underpinning all of this and it does<br>look like there might be some Upstream<br>epigenetic regulation of the gene going<br>on but we don't need to go into all of<br>that here and now because it's be a bit<br>dull uh but the reason why I wanted to<br>mention this was that data I showed you<br>for cyclop fosmid where you could see a<br>reasonably good association between CP 2<br>c19 and CP 2 V6 and your genes was all<br>done when the very first treatment cycle<br>so they were chemotherapy naive and when<br>we phenotype these patients with a probe<br>drug for cp2 c19 at that Cy just prior<br>to that cycle one there was hardly<br>anybody who was a phenotypic poor<br>metabolizer your Gene for sep2 c19<br>predicted your poor metabolizer status<br>however as soon as we waited till they'<br>had three or two or three cycles of<br>chemotherapy Y and we measured it again<br>that's when we could see this phena<br>conversion events occurring so I think<br>it's the accumulating inflammatory<br>damage from the cytotoxic drugs<br>themselves that causing a lot of this um<br>issue but more importantly when you<br>measure the cyclophos<br>pharmacokinetics activation of the prod<br>drug cp2 c19 Gene now won't uh doesn't<br>associate it's not because C2 c19 isn't<br>important it's just why a normal<br>metabolizer genot type is um poor<br>metabolizer phenotype any that's kind of<br>the thing I've been doing over the years<br>trying to understand a little bit more<br>about uh pharmacogenetics and the role<br>of uh this phoc conversion um phenomenon<br>but really really swiftly I just I won't<br>be too much longer I promise um I just<br>want to talk about this other drug the F<br>five fluo uracil and this Gene the dpyd<br>Gene and I want to talk about why uh<br>this is this drug sometimes and the<br>genotype around this means that<br>sometimes this drug is not safe in some<br>people so five fluoral or 5fu is used in<br>the treatment of uh particularly of um<br>um gastro intestinal cancers but<br>sometimes breast cancer as well and the<br>vast majority of a dose of five five a<br>few is eliminated from your body by this<br>enzyme dihydropyridine<br>dehydrogenate uh and if you've got an<br>inherited deficiency of that you'll end<br>up with elevated levels of 5fu and lots<br>of normal tissue toxicity and this<br>occurs in about 10 to 15% of people<br>people hospitalized very very severe<br>life-threatening toxicity so of a<br>substantial problem now across the globe<br>people have been chipping away trying to<br>understand this a bit better and um<br>there are four risk variants within this<br>Gene that have been reasonably well<br>clinically evaluated as to being<br>associated with this uh deficiency and<br>what I was a little bit worried about<br>was that at the time so this was a<br>couple years ago year or so ago that um<br>that this didn't seem to be very well<br>socialized within the New Zealand<br>community so I got together with a few<br>of my colleagues who are in the room<br>here and uh we wrote this Viewpoint<br>article just article just for the New<br>Zealand medical journal it wasn't going<br>to be world breaking news or anything<br>but just to make sure that people in New<br>Zealand in the oncology Community Etc<br>were aware about that that you could<br>test for these Gene variants dose adjust<br>and prevent this life-threatening<br>toxicity in individuals but the key<br>thing that came out of this I don't even<br>think this this has actually been cited<br>as a paper the key thing that's come out<br>of it is this paper and some of the<br>lobbying from these clinicians meant<br>that meds saafe changed the label and so<br>now in New Zealand it's recommended that<br>you test for dpd before dpd genotype<br>before you treat your patients and not<br>only that it's now in clinical use over<br>the last six months or so which I think<br>is really quite nice news really I guess<br>for for patients but there's always a<br>butt isn't there so unfortunately those<br>four risk variants are the tiny tiny<br>little Drop in the Ocean of the huge<br>complexity of the genetic variation of<br>of the dpyd Gene and moreover uh people<br>who have this life-threatening toxicity<br>these four variants don't really count<br>for the vast majority of people so<br>there's something that we don't know<br>we're missing some information and we<br>need to understand that a little bit<br>better and so that's what uh triggered<br>us off to try to try a different<br>approach and this approach is using an<br>analog of five Flor uracil which is<br>called five methy uracil completely safe<br>because it's the endogenous substrate<br>for this enzyme and uh you can<br>pre-screen your patients completely<br>agnostic to what might be the underlying<br>cause of this dpd deficiency and this<br>was work uh first established with my<br>colleague John duly in Australia because<br>he was a he was a world leading expert<br>on uh inborn eras of purine and<br>perimidine Metabolism so he knew his<br>stuff um anyway we've worked together on<br>this over a few years and we had some<br>evidence to say that this test is<br>probably better than just relying on<br>those four variants in your genotype to<br>predict who might be um at risk of this<br>life-threatening toxicity and based on<br>all of this we've been able to do a uh<br>larger prospective uh clinical trial in<br>New Zealand to test this type of<br>approach using thyine um we're still<br>waiting the final bit of statistical<br>reporting on that because of course this<br>got hammered with all the disruptions<br>around covid Etc uh but I cannot wait to<br>be able to start talking to you about<br>that because there's some unusual and<br>interesting findings coming out of that<br>but I couldn't do any of this at all<br>without a team of people now I actually<br>have quite a small team in of employees<br>anyway that's for sure and I can see<br>Mike smiling at the back there so I've<br>only ever had a small group of of<br>research technicians and postdoctoral<br>fellows so Mike um who's of the top you<br>can see Mike the top over there uh was<br>my very first research technician and<br>Mike's now working uh many years working<br>as the laboratory manager for the school<br>so moved up and on um the person next to<br>Mike there is JP and sadly JP died very<br>suddenly got ill and then died in 2017<br>which obviously was very very<br>devastating for the research group and<br>all all his friends and a horrible thing<br>to happen so just a memory of JP there<br>CLA worked with for a little while and<br>sui was also uh postop briefly with my<br>my team but there's one key person I<br>need to mention here and as by usual<br>when you're looking for people you can't<br>find them there you go someone's<br>pointing at you it's Katie Katie Burns<br>so I've known Katie since she was doing<br>her master's degree and Katie is now a<br>senior Lector in the department of<br>pharmacology and Katie is the most<br>robust scientist I know keeps me on the<br>straight and narrow every time I get too<br>excited about something slows me down<br>makes me do it properly Etc and um we<br>have the whole team and all everything<br>that we've done has been lots and lots<br>of different projects I've only spoken a<br>little bit about the cancer<br>pharmacogenomics work we do but we've<br>done lots and lots of different projects<br>together over the years but of course<br>the team isn't just those people that<br>get employed is also all the research<br>students that have come through the lab<br>and um these are key people and I<br>really really grateful to have been able<br>to have all these people around I really<br>like having students about and I'm<br>really um glad I can train early career<br>researchers because I think it's a<br>really key thing that we should be doing<br>I hopefully I've remembered everyone<br>couldn't find um photographs of everyone<br>but we've got a fair few there and some<br>with me not so great obviously um but<br>just for the final few minutes um I just<br>wanted to say of course we have another<br>hat that we wear as an academic our our<br>service hat not sure if I've got the<br>right hats for the different roles there<br>and I do think it's very very important<br>to give back as well give back to our<br>communities that we work in so over the<br>years I was have had lots and lots of um<br>institutionally based roles I guess<br>within the university in the role of uh<br>post-graduate uh committees like I said<br>I was the postgraduate director for the<br>school then sat on faculty committees<br>University committees around all that<br>and for quite a while as well uh little<br>roles within the department uh as well<br>so I've been busy doing those things but<br>the other thing I think is also really<br>important to always remember you need to<br>give back not to kind but to the<br>students as well and then I want to<br>mention this so hopefully you all many<br>of you will have heard of healthx and I<br>just want to tell you about the birth of<br>healthx so um I it was Christmas holiday<br>time somewhere about to start last day<br>of work waiting for Malcolm because it<br>was nearly finished nearly finished I<br>won't be just be a few more minutes and<br>I was kind of hovering in the corridor<br>chatting to Larry and we were both just<br>going like yeah this summer looking<br>forward to and it was the days before we<br>had all the really high security swipe<br>card access to the floors Etc and this<br>student wanded past and she said oh I'm<br>glad I found someone because I was<br>looking for someone to help me I want to<br>run a student research conference and to<br>me and Larry were going like oh damn<br>there's nobody else here anyway um so we<br>thought yeah let's let you know come<br>let's come and talk to us in the new<br>year and and she duely did um but the<br>key thing about this is um it was<br>Serenity obviously but the key thing was<br>that we set this all up healthx to be<br>student initiative student Le student<br>research and it to be totally um<br>sustainable and sustained by the<br>students and I was involved in that and<br>the kind of backroom roles to make sure<br>just a little nudge here and a nudge<br>there to make sure that the students<br>kept that going for about 10 years is<br>and if you haven't been involved in<br>health X at all I highly recommend you<br>go along the students do an amazing job<br>better than most of the professional<br>conferences we go to um I also do lots<br>of other um sort of service roles to I<br>guess your what you'd call your your um<br>your academic discipline I and I started<br>small I suppose I helped set up the<br>ockland ccer research Network which is<br>the Forerunner of teaka uh manga mate<br>pukao and I also was involved quite a<br>lot in the early part of my career as<br>with the New Zealand Society for<br>oncology and over the years I've been<br>multiple roles within the austral Asian<br>Society of clinical and experimental<br>pharmacologists and<br>toxicologists in fact I was the first<br>female um uh uh chair of the New Zealand<br>section it's always nice to be the first<br>of females and stuff um and what else uh<br>I am the also the chair of the<br>pharmacogenomic section for the society<br>and I've been on the the executive board<br>Etc so lots of things there over the<br>years though I've also always been a<br>member of the British pharmacology<br>society and for a wee while I was the<br>executive editor of one of their<br>journals and this is um I need I need a<br>little bit of validation every now and<br>then and um I was absolutely blown away<br>when they made me a fellow of the<br>British pharmacology Society because I<br>taught myself pharmacology so um I yeah<br>thank you I's like wow didn't know where<br>that came from um and there's other um<br>pharmacology related things there that<br>I'm a member of international things um<br>but I'm also uh I think it's very<br>important that you give back to your<br>again to your local community and so I'm<br>I've been quite a long-standing member<br>of the uh cancer research trust gr Grant<br>awarding committees and more recently<br>have been a member of the amrf<br>Committees too so I think all of those<br>roles are very important things to do<br>you join a committee you do make a<br>difference to people I'm sure<br>but nearly<br>finished work life balance it's a puzzle<br>to us all I'm<br>sure um family and friends family and<br>and friends are really important to me<br>as are my chickens um and uh I I do try<br>to get some sort of work life balance<br>and there is nothing better to put a<br>smile on my face than running around on<br>a hockey pitch for those ladies back up<br>there over a Saturday afternoon so hi<br>girls<br>um yeah you yeah you've got to find<br>something to make you smile haven't you<br>um but there's one final person I need<br>to thank and that's Malcolm and<br>um uh we do still do quite a lot of<br>research together odd bits of research<br>or bits of odd research I'm not sure<br>which it is um but I just wanted to uh<br>say I don't always have the most robust<br>of mental health and I have had periods<br>of my life which have been very<br>challenging and very difficult and<br>Malcolm's been there for me and I guess<br>picked me up patted me on the head moved<br>me along and so I just wanted to say a<br>big thank you to my best<br>friend so in conclusion in summary being<br>able to do this job as an academic is<br>really my happy place being able to do<br>the three roles of an academic of<br>research teaching and service really<br>does put a smile on my face and uh<br>hopefully you can see I had that really<br>strange title because I do sometimes<br>feel like I go this way that way and the<br>other but my bigger picture view of the<br>my research is that I do cancer<br>pharmacogenomics uh namii<br>uh K T Co CLA W<br>tooing um hello everyone my name is CLA<br>wall I'm head of the Department of<br>nutrition and dietetics in the school of<br>medical sciences and I'm Paul<br>Donaldson's representative tonight so<br>Paul donison is the um head of school<br>and he is overseas currently and it's<br>really disappointed not to be here and I<br>know how much he really wanted to be<br>here for this very very special occasion<br>um but so fortunate for me because I am<br>able to have the opportunity to thank<br>you nula for your amazing presentation<br>and such an insight into your<br>heritage and your most extraordinary um<br>career and I really do hope that we'll<br>tonight um although my knowledge of um<br>pharmacokinetics and genetics is kind of<br>very very limited particularly the<br>language I thought your talk was amazing<br>because it made your work really<br>relatable I understood it the importance<br>of it and I now really know what you do<br>newa and and and a little bit of<br>nutrition the phy Easter and stuff in<br>there really really<br>interesting um I think your research to<br>me and your career really epitomizes<br>what our faculty is about what our<br>school is about which is the how<br>translational it is and impactful it is<br>and so that whole notion of bench to<br>bedside uh you know working with<br>clinicians working with communities<br>really epitomizes your career and um<br>your your<br>journey I thank you from behalf of all<br>of us for your really amazingly<br>significant contributions both to<br>research but to teaching and to service<br>um for your across the school to you<br>know The Faculty the university and<br>nationally and internationally as well<br>you're one of the smartest people that I<br>know nula and Incredibly modest and as<br>Alan said very very kind so it's been<br>such a pleasure to be able to celebrate<br>you tonight it really has and I'm going<br>to finish with a a too and it's<br>food<br>related um of course um K<br>tum AO Anor Tona<br>isora thank you CLA thank you n that was<br>an outstanding lecture i' just like to<br>Echo CLA sentiments really enjoyed it I<br>learned a whole lot about uh<br>pharmacogenetics which is really<br>important for me in my ongoing education<br>um wonderful to see the collaboration<br>with clinicians and the real impact<br>that's talked about but perhaps most<br>impressive um is the commitment to all<br>of the aspects of that academic life<br>that you highlighted so beautifully I<br>don't think I've ever seen that done in<br>an inaugural lecture before so thank you<br>for holding up each of those components<br>in such a high view because it is really<br>with each of those components that we<br>get our job<br>done so so um I guess the final thing is<br>to present you with a little Memorial of<br>again I'd like to thank you all for<br>coming out this evening um please join<br>us for some drinks and snacks and um<br>congratulations to nula enjoy the<br>evening celebrate and enjoy the dancing</p></main><footer
