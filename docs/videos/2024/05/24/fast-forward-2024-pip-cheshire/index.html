to<br>welcome you here to the to the third uh<br>fast forward series fast forward lecture<br>of the 2024 Series so this is the the<br>last of the three that we're doing this<br>semester um welcome uh health and safety<br>uh if you need a bathroom uh head out<br>and head anticlockwise around the<br>building um the the bathrooms are just<br>uh next door uh in the unlikely event of<br>an emergency um head out through the<br>doors and the the Gathering Spot is out<br>on out on Simon Street um we're<br>tremendously grateful for the support<br>that jib uh gives to this lecture series<br>we couldn't do what we do without their<br>support so I'm just going to uh welcome<br>John Kitchen who's the area sales<br>manager for jib to say a few words thank<br>you thank you Andre<br>um as you see on here we've um proudly<br>sponsored the fast forward series and um<br>Andrew and I was just talking earlier<br>for 17 years now um so but tonight<br>particularly I think the proudly<br>sponsored is um extremely privileged to<br>uh sponsor tonight's speaker um<br>unbeknownst to pip he's had quite an<br>influence on my career um as a young<br>architectual rep many years ago as you<br>can tell um uh Pip's team actually<br>helped me write my first brocher um and<br>uh and uh get it into um the various<br>Building Code Compliance and knock it<br>into shape so um what you probably don't<br>know is is how much Pippen and his<br>colleagues have uh contributed to the<br>industry and very much that part of it I<br>suppose is being kept below the radar um<br>for for for a number of reasons but um<br>um please enjoy tonight um you'll see a<br>video shortly of our new Tanger Factory<br>um it's up and running uh heaps of<br>capacity so no problems there anymore<br>and um yeah and uh been been a real<br>journey um for us a lot harder to get uh<br>up to the standard that we set ourselves<br>um it's not just a plus wood plant it's<br>it's a jib plus wood plant so um<br>hopefully you'll see uh uh many years to<br>come you'll see the the output from it<br>and not to um dissuade from our Cross<br>chch plant we still have Cross chch<br>plant as well so yeah both both islands<br>and um both plants running extremely<br>that<br>c all right thank you um so um uh again<br>thank thanks to jib I'm going to<br>strongly encourage you when you go into<br>the office tomorrow morning to specify<br>jib not on the not just on the inside of<br>your building but on the outside of your<br>building which is actually a thing you<br>can do now it's called weather line so<br>um um uh so it's a real kind of personal<br>um treat for me to introduce pip um like<br>I think a lot of um folk here I'm<br>someone that has kind of benefited<br>greatly from spending some time and kind<br>of close in in Pip's orbit and I don't<br>think I'd be doing what I'm doing now<br>had it not been for that kind of time<br>under his uh influence and you know the<br>the What's occasioned um this um this<br>event is you know the profession and the<br>academy are very good at kind of giving<br>ourselves Awards and prizes and things<br>and certainly pep has collected up<br>literally all of those um you know um<br>here in the academy he's been a<br>distinguished professor<br>an Adjunct professor and also a<br>distinguished alumni um for the<br>institute at The Institute local Awards<br>national awards been president of the<br>Institute gold medalist literally<br>everything um everything that the<br>Institute has on offer um but every now<br>and then something kind of interesting<br>happens and Society in general starts to<br>pay attention to architecture uh and so<br>this year pip was um announced as the<br>recipient of the companion of the New<br>Zealand order of Merit which is<br>something really special uh when<br>essentially the the nation looks on and<br>wants to best bestow that kind of Honor<br>uh on on on one of one of our one of our<br>family so that's a kind of lovely moment<br>to celebrate so what I'm going to ask<br>you to do is to a round of applause to<br>welcome pip and also congratulate him on<br>his<br>okay uh thank you Andrew uh very<br>gracious uh introduction uh we had the<br>pleasure of working together for three<br>or four five years something like that<br>uh and working on block you know which<br>was uh a project D to our hearts uh the<br>local newsletter broad sheet and uh<br>begot the um maps of New Zealand<br>architecture which uh Andrew is carrying<br>on uh and are just an invaluable guide<br>to uh our history you know if we don't<br>know ourselves how can we uh do anything<br>so uh thank you for that and also thank<br>you John uh a rare uh honor to be<br>introduced to somebody who helped you<br>meet code<br>uh uh I was a bit uncertain about uh<br>what to talk about and uh so I asked<br>Valentina who uh uh works very closely<br>to our studio very close to our studio<br>and makes great coffee and she said um<br>that uh I should give a sort of overview<br>of things and<br>um uh a few Hot Tips would be good and<br>we've bit of experience of what I've<br>been up to so uh this is a bit of graay<br>bag uh I grew up on the waterfront not<br>not here this is Lake Topo but uh not<br>unlike where I grew up in Christ Church<br>on the waterfront although the sea was<br>usually a bit more turbulent but I spent<br>a lot of time there I was uh um I I was<br>hospitalized when I was very young for<br>some operations on my leg and so I spent<br>quite a lot of time gazing out to seea<br>and I didn't see a sort of murky eye in<br>the distance I saw the seawood korus but<br>uh not long after that I started<br>spending a lot of time bobbing around in<br>the water like these uh people<br>are and so uh there was a sense of<br>observing the world and over the road<br>from where I was propped up and bed they<br>were building a seaw wall they were<br>stabilizing Waterfront at SAR and it had<br>been Junes when I was very very young uh<br>but they dumped a lot of rocks there in<br>order to stabilize because the sea was<br>eating it away and then built a seaw<br>wall and so I was uh propped up there<br>watching the trucks coming and going and<br>uh there was a sense of watching things<br>happening out there but eventually I uh<br>got upright in Mobile and started<br>heading out<br>into uh the country and seeing a bit of<br>it and when I was a teenager I guess I<br>started heading off over to Banks<br>Peninsula and uh this is ralo Bay very<br>interesting interesting Little Bay it's<br>one of the few Bays that has no<br>occupation within the bay with no<br>permanent occupation within the bay and<br>so we would drive along down those<br>Headlands and then have to walk down the<br>hill with our surfboards and uh surf uh<br>these lovely lonely empty beaches but it<br>wasn't totally unoccupied as you can see<br>this little house up here uh is a very<br>beautiful lonely house uh that I<br>thought uh added a great deal to the Bay<br>really I mean I look one loves a good<br>empty Bay and particularly if there are<br>no other Surfers around that's the best<br>thing that we might hope for um but<br>there is a sort poignancy about that<br>operation about that occupation at the<br>base of the cliff that I thought was<br>really lovely and as one gets a bit<br>closer to it there you see the<br>footprints and the surfboards leaning<br>against the wall quite a lovely little<br>place uh bit further away uh North<br>Africa uh a building on the hillside uh<br>and again you know this extraordinary uh<br>sense of occupation of the landscape<br>that uh the role of the hill is<br>beautiful as the role of the banks<br>Peninsula Hills is very beautiful very<br>evocative there's something about the uh<br>construction of a building within that<br>landscape<br>that uh energizes and excites for<br>me so this is uh Stow in England you<br>know the classic kind of manufactured<br>and carefully considered<br>view looking down the uh the pond and<br>then to the Folly at the end and then<br>looking back claiming the whole of this<br>Valley uh with the eye traveling to the<br>uh Horizon and then the Obelisk marking<br>the extent of uh one's View and then<br>inviting you of course to view beyond<br>that uh our buildings are not quite so<br>uh uh considered generally uh this is a<br>little Delight down in the bottom end of<br>the West<br>Coast and uh more typically we tend to<br>plop buildings on tops of Hills uh so<br>I'm slightly uneasy well in fact Beyond<br>slightly I'm troubled by these here but<br>as an architect of course one gets a<br>commission that says build on top of a<br>hill and so sooner or later uh that<br>comes to me and I'll talk about that a<br>we bit longer in a few minutes this is a<br>project that uh Andrew and I worked very<br>closely on uh for the University at Goat<br>Island so this is part of the Marine<br>research in Institute at Goat Island and<br>this was a building done pretty much<br>entirely by Andrew and then constructed<br>by Shawn Flanigan or observed and uh<br>administered by Shan Flanigan uh it's a<br>a a dormatory building basically for uh<br>graduate students and it's part of a<br>composition of Laboratories and so uh<br>this is a building that is uh described<br>I described it or called it I think the<br>interpretive Center<br>and the idea was that the science that<br>was carried on within uh the<br>Laboratories here would be made visible<br>to the very many uh people who visit the<br>goate island beach during the course of<br>the year because go Island you may know<br>is one of the first was the first Marine<br>um uh protection area in the country and<br>it has a staggering number of visitors a<br>year almost like half a million people<br>or something in that order and the idea<br>was that uh the university might be able<br>to entice people do can we lost sound up<br>we back there keep talking oh you able<br>working talk to talk to our man up<br>here<br>unforunately no light I can't build them<br>very<br>yeah actually what I could probably<br>do do you want me to stay put there's<br>me hell no that's a sort of epidiascope<br>isn't<br>me<br>okay uh go Island uh interpreter Center<br>the idea was that people would be able<br>to walk up here and go into this<br>building and see something of the<br>science that was being carried on in the<br>Laboratories behind<br>it there's a security line uh to the<br>right of the building and so that this<br>was public access but beyond that was uh<br>the university and um a no go Zone I was<br>quite interested here in making a<br>building that would open itself back to<br>the bush uh the project was considered<br>at the beginning as part of what I hope<br>would be a Mainland Island because not<br>very far offshore is little barrier that<br>is overloaded with the uh native birds<br>and uh they are all jumping ship and<br>coming into Main Mainland and if we<br>could establish some Mainland Islands<br>then they would be stepping stones for<br>uh repopulating the mainland with birds<br>and so I thought that uh this building<br>might open itself to the Inland where<br>there was native Bush and so forth and<br>also I quite like the illusion of um of<br>fish gills and the striations of the<br>building that Shan Flanigan and I worked<br>on and the ability to look inside it so<br>that when one was walking up a fairly<br>Steep Hill from the beach you could look<br>in there and be enticed in so uh then oh<br>sorry I'm leaving all over this is um<br>thinking about uh the little h house<br>sorry the little house that we bought<br>long ago and has been our home for I 3<br>40 40 something years and it's always<br>been a wee bit of a laboratory and<br>particularly with respect to the light<br>that comes in it's a just a little<br>pyramidal Victorian Villa that's poor<br>things been hacked over so many times uh<br>and I enjoyed the way that it um one was<br>able to cever out little Bays I mean the<br>house next door is 10 ft away at most<br>sorry 3 m away uh and uh so this idea of<br>Windows uh letting light and and just<br>going back to that on either side there<br>is clear glass and so one gets a view<br>out to the city on the right and to the<br>left to uh Back<br>Garden uh here's a different<br>consideration of uh window in this it<br>takes um some inspiration from the way<br>that James Terrell treats openings in a<br>flat plane and so I'm sure you've all<br>seen those uh structures the metallic<br>structures with a very sharp edged uh<br>hole and which seems to bring the sky<br>down to the plane of the metal above<br>your head and so this<br>window uh is purporting to do or is<br>attempting to do a similar thing so that<br>there is uh this is a completed and<br>glazed window but no edges no trims no<br>nothing so the idea of bringing the far<br>view onto the wall plane of the<br>wall uh back to the poor little Villa<br>and uh Freeman Bay and this idea of<br>observation uh that uh one I wake up and<br>this is kind of what I see uh and I love<br>the idea that the double hang windows<br>are changing the geometry uh every day<br>you know as one works against the other<br>the glazing bar is going to reconfigure<br>and reframe The<br>View uh and out the back of the<br>might switch you over onto this<br>microphone<br>here on that one anyway let's just get<br>one okay all righty you hear okay yeah<br>good okay at the back<br>uh here the observation or or the<br>dragging of the garden into the house so<br>you know the little Villa is very<br>enclosed form and we had a big old lean<br>to out the back and everything was<br>tightly<br>enclosed and here just opening it<br>sideways and out with not so much sky<br>little bit poking up there and some nod<br>in a wink to Pacific kind paneling that<br>opens but of course you know this is uh<br>middle class<br>kiwi tipping a wink to the um Islands<br>you know the propped bit of plywood with<br>a stick in it but of course this has got<br>a few hundred worth of German<br>engineering propping it open so you know<br>I'm a paper tiger um same thing up in<br>the far north the idea of the L wide<br>horizontal view but the something placed<br>between the eye and the Long View and uh<br>then something between the eye and the<br>Observer and then the The View beyond<br>that again<br>and uh we all went up to a beach in the<br>far north and stayed right on the beach<br>maybe 5 10 m no more from uh very high<br>tide but a very large P car between us<br>and the Sea and so one had that sort of<br>mediated view all the time uh a<br>midr and uh the strength of that is um<br>you know really itched on um on the<br>imagination so here this is uh an areal<br>of Northland<br>uh and it's just a a note of the<br>spectacular land that is so accessible<br>so close to us and uh this little<br>project that I did this is going back an<br>awfully long<br>time on the hillside that purported to<br>be uh a b well in fact we had an<br>argument about it that for me I spent<br>more time in Tonga so it's a fall<br>uh for the owner it spent more time in<br>Fiji so it was a b whatever uh it was a<br>building that sought to occupy a very<br>distinct bit of land a peninsula that<br>was<br>shaped uh like a whale and was known as<br>the uh whales back and so this<br>development runs along a<br>ridge and uh in fact has a road that<br>runs right through it a path that runs<br>through it and so the path is remnant of<br>I think an old walking Track that went<br>up the coast and so the house is opened<br>it's not really the house the uh f is<br>opened to allow this um Passage through<br>here and um but then within the building<br>creates this very strong enclosure and<br>the outside is held long away and so<br>whilst one has the pathway running<br>through the house uh there is a real<br>strength of uh enclosure and darkness<br>within it a bit further north uh you<br>know as I'm I'm talking uh project now I<br>guess about this is about 15 20 years<br>ago uh got introduced to this very<br>beautiful part of the Northern Bay of<br>islands and again taking a building very<br>close to the water's edge and in this<br>case it was an alteration it was a uh<br>sharing shed placed hard on the water's<br>edge and so we were able<br>to uh do an extreme alteration<br>the plan and section are uh exactly as<br>the sharing shed was but I have to say<br>when I went up there for a visit the<br>Builder looked at me and said look we've<br>managed to save quite a lot of the old<br>building and so I was pretty excited<br>about that and then he pointed down the<br>beach and they just dragged the old<br>building down the beach and reused it<br>and recreated the same dimensions on the<br>same site but it did allow this very<br>intense relationship with the sea but<br>even though it's very close to the Sea<br>uh there are these again these the solid<br>Elements which hold you away from it<br>rather than um opening out too wide and<br>so we're trying to balance the uh<br>outsideness of the intensity of the<br>water and the hills<br>behind with the ability to shut it down<br>and hold up with a fire and my client<br>interest in uh South um South USA state<br>music uh country music from the south uh<br>mixed with a bit of um Howard Morrison<br>uh so uh there's a balance of enclosure<br>and uh this the dreaded inside outside<br>flow but here the inside outside flow uh<br>I have embraced it with enthusiasm so<br>the bench in this case rolls inside<br>outside door slides cross from the left<br>and again the building is open on both<br>Bay uh it offers this very intense<br>relationship with the with the uh ocean<br>and then sitting and behind it is a<br>hillside that um I was invited<br>to uh mess about with and so there was<br>an American landscape architect came out<br>and proposed that that that Hillside be<br>carved into a spherical or a section of<br>a sphere and uh I did a large number of<br>drawings of contour lines of you know<br>how the land was at the time which was a<br>very broken uh Valley and then what<br>would have to happen to it in order to<br>form the spherical shape went up there<br>and had a long conversation with the uh<br>bulldozer driver a guy with a big big<br>guy with one of those wonderful knitted<br>caterpillar singlets and he looked at<br>the drawings long and hard and uh then<br>folded them up and said beautiful<br>drawings boys and shoved them in his<br>back pocket and got on his Dozer never<br>looked at the drawings again worked for<br>a day and a half and made a beautiful uh<br>spherical<br>section so this<br>is invited uh I was invited to build a<br>house on this top here and I tried like<br>Fury not to do it I suggested that it<br>might be uh a number of other sites that<br>he uh the owner could construct on uh<br>thinking back to the great kiwi<br>tradition of the little pink house on<br>the top of the hill I was very nervous<br>about that we did have two puawa trees<br>uh sitting up on the hill and so I was<br>at pains to draw those and uh and to in<br>fact keep them because at uh a critical<br>stage the found ations had been set out<br>uh the Builder rang up and said that<br>they were going to get rid of the trees<br>cuz the damn things were in the way and<br>I didn't actually have to go there to<br>tie myself to it but I was getting close<br>to<br>that uh the house was considered as<br>a a composite of uh additions in fact it<br>was all built at the same time so<br>there's some uh hookum about this but<br>the idea was that the stone element<br>might have been might be suggestive of<br>something that was there earlier on uh<br>maybe it was some sort of U farming<br>thing or some sort of uh Distillery or<br>whatever and then a long barnik form<br>glued onto it on the uh Hing out towards<br>the sea and then at some later date<br>these uh low flat platforms were placed<br>or Pavilions were placed out either side<br>uh first thing I did when I went to the<br>top of the hill uh or when I started to<br>engage in the top of the hill was to get<br>a wind rose for the site and I thought<br>that that was a you know that would help<br>me shape the building but of course what<br>I found was that the wind blew almost<br>equal strength from every direction all<br>the time and so uh I I the house is<br>essentially Crucible in order to form<br>some outdoor sheltered spaces and uh<br>this is it from afar looking across it<br>it's quite a a compilation of elements<br>sitting on that Hillside as you can see<br>and the critical role of beuda was that<br>were kept and in fact uh two no three of<br>those trees were tracked in after the<br>event that they uh not only did the<br>original ones survive but they gained a<br>few friends and neighbors uh as I said<br>they have the building is a crucible and<br>these slots through so that one is aware<br>of the longer views that are available<br>on this site the site is very heavily<br>loaded with<br>um<br>precon uh occupation of the land and uh<br>is also uh has a significant role in the<br>first engagement of Mari and<br>Paka and so the buildings makes various<br>references to that uh G on uh there's a<br>corner of those of the cruciform in<br>order to provide uh a little shelter uh<br>from the wind and then this building of<br>the<br>toar this uh Remnant it was called<br>and uh we made up all sorts of um<br>possibilities of where where the tiwer<br>had come from what it was about and uh<br>it was a great excise in uh working this<br>of geometry the in terms of its plan<br>it's a uh two nested asymmetrical<br>ellipses so they're kind of egg shape<br>and plan one sitting inside another with<br>a interstial space through which<br>circulation travels and then the whole<br>thing has inara so it's kind of folding<br>in as well and it was a pretty solid<br>workout for uh our math and this is<br>quite a while while ago I don't know 15<br>years ago or something and uh first<br>advice from the engineer was buy sheares<br>and steel and<br>uh uh so the final project as I said has<br>these uh nested Towers with circulation<br>climbing up and so one uh climbs up with<br>little slot glimpses out to the far<br>distance some beautifully worked uh<br>Timber work uh I'm sorry I've been uh<br>we're going down sorry uh and so we've<br>ended up down in the um basement which<br>is a sell wine cell it's part of a<br>winery up in the North and the building<br>is this Tower is sort of considered in<br>the Gaston bashel out kind of model the<br>idea of the basement and then the midr<br>and then the far<br>Observatory uh and so this is a place<br>where one can haul up uh at the end of<br>the night and then lose all track of<br>time because you're deeply buried within<br>there and then uh perhaps at dawn you<br>ascend up the top or passing a bedroom<br>along the way and up to the observatory<br>at the<br>top<br>uh and uh finally one gets us little<br>estate uh and I guess it's that uh<br>observation the horizontal is uh uh<br>something that's Prett interesting up in<br>the north there that the views of the<br>sea and land are<br>incredibly<br>strong but at the end of the day as the<br>sun moves around over the land uh The<br>Ridges start to stand up and so the the<br>the big<br>story images of Sea Island beach and so<br>forth are somewhat secondary to this<br>layering of uh ridges in the far<br>distance uh about the time I was doing<br>that maybe earlier this is uh obviously<br>down in the south in the Antarctic<br>that's mount arabus in the background<br>and shackleton's Hut at Cape<br>roids and uh here we seeing I think you<br>know the absolute U intensity of human<br>occupation the stories associated with<br>these buildings and the artifacts which<br>are markers of those stories are so<br>extraordinary<br>that there is a story that uh on the<br>last visit that Ed Hillary made<br>to uh the antartic he went out<br>to uh Cape roids to this Hut and the<br>floor level is quite high it's about<br>this High I think and uh you have to go<br>up some quite steep steps and he went<br>up uh ahead of the others and he turned<br>and almost fell out and said uh he saw<br>the boss there and the boss was the<br>nickname for shlon uh I mean it's<br>apocryphal story of course uh but the<br>place was so imbued with the history and<br>the story of shlon that uh one believes<br>that uh the uh character is<br>still if not visible not far<br>away down the coast of it there's this<br>other beautiful little uh building this<br>is at Cape Evans so this is a building<br>that Scott left for the uh South Pole on<br>the Expedition the ill fated<br>Expedition uh so he never returned to<br>this this is a much more significant<br>building it's after the Kate roids one<br>and it has been described as if it were<br>the Ritz uh in terms of uh Antarctic<br>habitation so this is a third of the<br>Huts down there and my role has been as<br>a general architect within a Heritage<br>conservation<br>team and uh much of our work has<br>been uh reversing this so this is a<br>photograph taken really when the<br>buildings were first uh reentered Ed so<br>they were built about the turn of the U<br>19th 20th<br>century and there was what was called<br>the heroic age of um Antarctic<br>exploration pretty much ended with Scots<br>Expedition and then the buildings were<br>left and really left until the 1950s<br>when the US mounted a major scientific<br>uh Expedition down to the Antarctic and<br>reopened it and so this is a photograph<br>taken at that time where somebody<br>climbed through a window and found this<br>uh building the state and so our work<br>has been trying to prevent this<br>happening again and uh there's a team of<br>conservation Architects Builders and uh<br>conservatives of artifacts and I'm the<br>I'm the sort of generalist because the<br>uh conservation Specialists will talk<br>flat out backwards and forwards and<br>somebody has to say well I've heard<br>everything going that way and that's<br>kind of my role uh the work is pretty<br>robust so this is conservation work in<br>uh Cape<br>Evans digging a trench here uh there are<br>some really interesting issues of gas<br>exchange and water exchange and so for<br>about two weeks a year about 3 hours a<br>day there is free water that moves<br>through the uh top layer of the uh<br>scoria upon which the house is built so<br>there's a permafrost so permanent Frozen<br>soil and then uh for as I said for a<br>couple of weeks a year there's loose<br>shingle water moving through it here we<br>uh take a big trench and build a<br>polycarbonate Dam to divert water around<br>the Huts because the water was flowing<br>under the floor and freezing so this is<br>conservation work uh at its extreme here<br>the floor has been lifted<br>up uh ice and snow underneath the floor<br>has been jackhammered out of the way<br>blowing uh hot air into the uh subfloor<br>to try and dry everything out and uh and<br>then uh replacing the<br>floorboards at the same time as a little<br>container on the water's edge uh these<br>people are conserving the artifact so uh<br>broken glass is beautifully reassembled<br>into uh complete objects and uh<br>stabilizing the rust and so forth but<br>it's a tough environment and<br>paradoxically now the project is having<br>to deal with the very Advanced effects<br>of uh global<br>warming and<br>so the uh issues are things like the<br>lowering of the per Frost level and uh<br>for this Hut it's okay but one of the<br>other Huts the first Hut that gotot<br>built sits on uh what's called an ice<br>lens which is really like a contact lens<br>but VI great thing made out of ice it's<br>about 5 m thick and it's starting to<br>melt and so uh this very important Hut<br>uh is starting to<br>drop and uh there also um because the<br>sea ice is not form me at the right time<br>there are erosion problems and a whole<br>gamut of stuff going on like that anyway<br>uh the really exciting thing is that<br>there is some really serious science<br>being applied to it now and um I'm very<br>fortunate to sit in meetings where we uh<br>can engage in these issues of gas<br>exchange and temper temperature<br>variations and the mapping Technologies<br>which are applied to laser scanning and<br>so forth uh really is giving us a huge<br>fund of uh data about which uh which<br>allows us to make some considerations of<br>uh or some plans for how we're going to<br>deal with the<br>projects uh this of course is britmart<br>and uh this project<br>started long ago I guess when I was at<br>jasmax uh jasmax joined with Mario<br>mediac<br>uh who was uh well is uh a American<br>architect in New Zealand he was a man<br>alone who did very well in the first<br>round of the britam out railway station<br>competition and uh then we jazmax joined<br>with him to build the underground rail<br>station and then partway through that<br>project the construction of that project<br>the What's called the above ground stuff<br>was put out to bid and uh this was a<br>plan one of many that we did that<br>identified the sorts of uses were going<br>to be there the city had a great desire<br>to Mix commercial<br>residential and uh retail food and<br>barage and so forth and so we were<br>coding all of these things and uh there<br>was part of a a bid a two-stage bid one<br>was a financial package the other was a<br>design package and we worked on this uh<br>design package and um I was still a<br>chairm at this time we had one great<br>meeting where the city council came up<br>and said uh look you guys are on the<br>home stretch except that you have<br>proposed me as the Project Director for<br>it but I was teaching at University I<br>was uh running jzm mixs at the time and<br>they said something has to go uh so in<br>that period of time I offered to abandon<br>uh they said they were back in half an<br>hour to know what I was going to do and<br>so in that half hour we made the<br>decision to uh exit jazm sta practice<br>and uh just focus on on this project the<br>first building that we did and remember<br>well in fact you can't remember some of<br>you won't remember at all bitmart was a<br>tough bit of town uh railway station had<br>been moved out across to that great<br>building uh that is now a university<br>hostel<br>um and uh in its place was a bus station<br>car park very large car park and as Nat<br>says it was place to buy drugs and<br>hookers as a father I didn't uh drill<br>too closely about his experience with<br>that<br>um there it's basically uh eight or nine<br>city blocks with about 19 Heritage<br>buildings they say about 19 because some<br>of the buildings not are not really U<br>serious Heritage um listed or protected<br>buildings and there was a bit of dispute<br>over one of the buildings but this<br>building here this is the northern<br>steamship company there a building that<br>been altered a fair bit I think it had<br>an extra story popped on the top at one<br>stage and the uh Gable and roof was<br>reconfigured but one of the things that<br>had happened had been sliced on this<br>Western face or left this face we're<br>looking at on the left uh it had been<br>sliced off in order to form Gore Street<br>which runs from Custom through to key<br>and because of that it had no uh<br>Heritage listing whatsoever or<br>protections and we were able to<br>manipulate the facade in order to form<br>these openings down at pavement level<br>and this is the very first project that<br>we uh started to engage in this way that<br>the buildings might be reconfigured in<br>order to provide uh to to open them up<br>and provide uh places of public uh<br>entertainment and use uh because the<br>they were originally built as warehouses<br>and so the floor levels are typically up<br>about a meter or so so that a horse and<br>Dr could back up to it or a truck could<br>back up to it and so there fairly<br>enclosed buildings so that level change<br>has always been a bit of an issue to<br>deal with uh one of the other early<br>occupations here was a project that uh<br>Nat drove and this was a Brite Country<br>Club and so it was a building that made<br>use of a corner site um the site of<br>where the brout hotel is now and sort to<br>introduce something of the character of<br>what was going to come or some of the uh<br>energy and excitement of what was going<br>to come to to britmart and probably the<br>first time that<br>uh Nat employed the terminology of the H<br>humble special and so these are pairings<br>of words so I have been using in the<br>past um the um Levi Strauss term of the<br>raw and the cooked so that one would<br>talk about the raw un un civilized<br>building if you like the tough robust<br>building with the cooked the machined<br>finely grained uh uh or finely rought<br>elements placed against raw building<br>here uh we're talking about uh humble<br>materials but manipulated in a very<br>special way to make to make a a<br>delight and so we see the you know they<br>apotheosis of it here really the<br>shipping container with marble and and<br>so uh it introduced this notion of um a<br>kind of<br>Earth uh luxury<br>really and the other thing that uh it<br>was first example of really is starting<br>to drill into these buildings and<br>create uh linkages Crossways so that<br>brart really uh when we arrived was a<br>ring of buildings ring of Heritage<br>Buildings Construction Site in the<br>middle as the railway station was filled<br>in uh and quite hard to get at as a<br>pedestrian so the connection to Mid town<br>that is to say shortland high and so on<br>um quite tough because of the Cross down<br>traffic from um custom east to west<br>traffic on Customs uh and has been<br>described often as being uh a goat I'm<br>sorry a moat filled with mechanical<br>alligators and you know as a barrier to<br>that movement north and south and so we<br>were very keen that Britain would do<br>everything it could in order<br>to uh uh provide a sort of<br>um uh cross linkages through that and<br>actually if I just go back at I just<br>want to talk about uh here this um uh<br>let me see am I going to yeah this<br>little lane<br>here um didn't really exist I don't<br>think but we just kept drawing it on<br>plan and uh<br>uh it you know it seemed really crucial<br>that uh that we could link here and<br>here and uh with the eye and that one<br>could walk and um it it became a sort of<br>fact uh so that was a really interesting<br>kind of strategy about how one might go<br>about making<br>spaces uh so this is a further<br>occupation of britam mat<br>in early on there was a project there<br>for uh some lowrise buildings so the<br>concern is a very<br>sophisticated um reconfiguration of<br>britmart and a growing of the way that<br>it might work as a uh commercial and<br>entertainment environment and I think<br>the city were very lucky that the<br>developer who won the bid had had quite<br>a lot of experience in the United States<br>and bought a lot of that experience back<br>here understood the importance of<br>growing the city that it was not a<br>matter of making a building and then<br>putting a uh fiss sign in the window<br>that one actually had to uh very<br>carefully Blow The Embers of commercial<br>activity inside of the uh Precinct and<br>support the tenants in fact you had to<br>create and grow your tenants and so uh<br>this is a project you guys will<br>recognize grass here of working with mil<br>at mils a little dessert restaurant that<br>was uh tucked<br>into a space that was originally<br>configured as a public toilet um but<br>prior to occupation uh the very<br>enthusiastic uh leasing agent for the<br>developer said uh I've got a tenant who<br>can make something out of that and so uh<br>here uh a project was generated that<br>wanted to make something out of this<br>quite robust uh environment built as a<br>as I said for a public toilet uh<br>software generated uh laser cutting uh<br>so that each of these little triangles<br>was slightly different a common fixing<br>Point uh each triangle was uh numbered<br>and so you would pick out number one put<br>a little clip on it get number two and<br>by the time you got to about 150 it<br>would start to curve into this uh<br>complex form and uh the degree of of<br>opacity would vary according to its<br>proximity to the window and so uh where<br>the contractor had uh felt that it was a<br>going to be a very challenging task and<br>therefore terribly expensive found<br>themselves creating this I think in a<br>couple of days or so something like<br>that uh back to building on the hilltop<br>in the north again uh this is uh a<br>project that commemorates what's<br>described as the first formal engage to<br>Mar and pakha that was uh identified or<br>occasioned as the time when mden arrived<br>here under the egis of um Rara the local<br>Chief uh to bring Christianity and I<br>think uh muskets and a few other bits<br>and pieces uh and so this project here<br>was uh to commemorate the 200th<br>anniversary of that uh sermon on uh<br>Christmas day that miston delivered<br>pretty simple form of a building there's<br>so two uh formed Ram Earth structures<br>facing out over the valley below uh the<br>project had been through a large number<br>of iterations as<br>uh we started as a uh as a kind of<br>library and school and accommodation and<br>uh that uh was a very eurocentric<br>reading of the history and of the site<br>and we backed off and uh formed a uh<br>working group with um uh a number of uh<br>ew uh representatives and some sculptors<br>and uh started to understand the land as<br>uh representing two sides of a coin if<br>you like on the right hand side was the<br>uh<br>preon uh land<br>and you can see in the center of the<br>screen remnants of the parite here uh<br>the trees up here which uh we understand<br>was the place where roar's body was<br>prepared for burial on the left hand<br>side of the valley excuse me is uh a<br>pastoral experience of the land and so<br>it's very eurocentric kind of use of<br>land there's eight wire fences and uh<br>sheep grazing and all that sort of stuff<br>and so it seemed after the intensity of<br>trying to design a building uh that some<br>observation of these two sides of the<br>land would be much more reflective and<br>um<br>uh potent uh way of marking that time it<br>was part of to be part of a<br>larger uh series of structures on the on<br>that Ridge on the left uh the left yeah<br>on the left uh the was what was called<br>the Gathering space and so this was<br>considered as a place where people<br>might uh meet and<br>discuss uh I hoped uh matters of land<br>uh acquisition want of a better term um<br>and it's a very very large landscape you<br>saw may remember the very long um ridges<br>that I talked about the sun U bringing<br>them into play and so in the Ridge the<br>idea was to somehow make a building that<br>was strong but not uh couldn't be large<br>because a very sensitive bit of<br>landscape and so I thought that one<br>might have<br>a disturbance of the Horizon so that<br>when one was out at Sea you would look<br>in and all of a sudden there would be<br>some small element of it that<br>was<br>um uh a kind of perturbation that was<br>not natural in its uh<br>formation and uh it had as its Genesis<br>this idea that the land might be lifted<br>up and propped up and that there might<br>be some uh play with the idea of the<br>hyper style Hall and uh maybe the pangos<br>might give rise to a um order of<br>columns and uh then the there would be<br>this horizontal strip of land and of uh<br>bush behind you it didn't happen I'm<br>have hasten to say and probably not a<br>bad thing uh so this is a drawing of NS<br>uh for a project up on the Kyra two<br>small buildings and uh sitting out there<br>very small about uh what they about 5 m<br>Square I think<br>and sort of two PS in a pod and<br>conceptualizing but quite different in<br>character<br>and that's partly to do with the<br>interior of it that uh this one here is<br>play with the other one is uh black U<br>form p uh but the openings here are<br>quite interesting because uh whilst one<br>looks out one also of course looks in<br>but not only looks in one has to get in<br>through the window so this is the only<br>way that one might access this building<br>uh door slides away in behind the<br>weather screen and uh you clamber up<br>over the Rock and in you go and on the<br>other side on the out downhill side<br>again the window slides into behind the<br>weather screen and it becomes a a seat<br>site yeah so very simple plan single<br>story with a medine over half of<br>it and you see here the uh other side of<br>that building there sorry it's twin the<br>black line and a little hint of the<br>kitchen on the left brass kitchen you<br>here uh this is a bit more extravagant<br>than its uh occupation of land and uh I<br>was quite keen on<br>U uh a building that uh Revisited The<br>Glass House model the kind of Pavilion<br>you know the Philip Johnson the M<br>vandero<br>um but here that we might um I'm a bit<br>disturbed I need to make a confession<br>here uh<br>the uh cone on the left uh should have<br>two flu here and uh photographer was so<br>offended by the flu poking out that he's<br>photosho them out<br>uh and I've had a sort of ethical<br>dilemma as to whether I should show the<br>slide or whether I should tell you about<br>it so I've come<br>clean uh when the owner saw them the<br>offshore owner when he saw them he said<br>this it's paing what a failure uh get<br>rid of them and so we engineered uh some<br>flu that would disappear into like<br>telescope themselves and then pop up and<br>distribute<br>smoke uh thank God the cost put them off<br>because the detailing and weathering of<br>it would be just a nightmare whatever<br>this is the open Pavilion and these<br>cones are really just thinking about uh<br>conversations that Pete Bosley and I<br>used to have long<br>ago<br>um about um necessary rooms that uh they<br>would<br>be one would look at those um palladian<br>Villas and they would be beautifully<br>composed and actually<br>organized uh and they would have a major<br>room and a another major room and then a<br>salon or whatever and then there would<br>be something with a small bit of text on<br>it and if you squinted at the legend it<br>would say necessary rooms although they<br>were uh in the manner of writing they<br>the the uh s's always looked like FS you<br>know they had that beautiful long and so<br>they always became neery rooms for Pete<br>and I when we talked about it and uh<br>here the nephy rooms are buried inside<br>of those cones and so it allowed the<br>building to be essentially an open<br>Pavilion with things buried inside of<br>the Pavilion with inside of the um cones<br>and then they created these lovely<br>little interal spaces between the cones<br>uh where one could uh develop a bit of<br>privacy uh and then now we're leaping<br>away off to much more contemporary<br>building down on W hiei uh very<br>beautiful building I'm allowed to say<br>that because it's not done by me it's<br>done by uh Nat and uh George Gregory<br>from our studio and uh again a reworking<br>of the of a glass Pavilion but then<br>coupled here with a pretty solid uh<br>block of building where the neair rooms<br>are and so uh the building is<br>essentially this very elegant skinny<br>room roof a rock wall that uh in fact<br>it's a significantly large Rock block<br>that's hollowed out uh for those Neary<br>rooms and then living just moving the<br>great inside outdoor flow and uh the<br>exterior walls just a series of these<br>very tall opening<br>doors uh and<br>so uh and a flu much more elegant flu<br>than that other one that I think God was<br>photoshopped<br>out uh and uh this is really where the<br>great bulk of the living goes except for<br>sleeping and washing and so forth and<br>one Retreats inside of the opening into<br>the stone wall and uh comes to these uh<br>very elegant uh places where uh one is<br>bathed uh we're back in brit out again<br>here and this is a useful overview so on<br>the right uh where underneath the um<br>these uh these ruls here uh was really<br>the first of the sort of<br>permanent uh well no what you saying you<br>they temporary uh buildings because<br>temporary means they're going to be<br>there for what 20 years I think isn't it<br>um and so uh retail and food and<br>beverage and then uh the black roofed<br>elements were a t or fourth ready that 6<br>months before the World Cup footy cup<br>was to be held uh the developer uh<br>thought it would be really good to have<br>some retail and food and beverage there<br>and so in a uh Herculean bit of um<br>designing and<br>documenting Nat and the Gang uh and uh<br>assemble from down south from uh<br>Queenstown uh work to deliver those<br>buildings on the left of course uh the<br>britmart hotel that was as I showed<br>before the site of the britmart country<br>club this drawing oh sorry this uh<br>building had its Genesis about 10 years<br>ago something like that with a large<br>number of drawings done by Nat and then<br>uh achieved a sort of<br>momentum<br>uh I'm not sure what the mo what the<br>imperative was for<br>construct uh but our client is resident<br>offshore much of the time and uh I think<br>that uh it's much to our advantage that<br>he is offshore and then travels through<br>the<br>stratosphere once or twice a month and<br>has you know 10 hours of being up in the<br>clouds<br>to ruminate on the development of<br>britmart and of particular buildings<br>when he hits the ground he knows the<br>buildings better than we do really uh<br>it's quite unnerving having a session<br>with him as he uh will pour over a<br>drawing and zero in on uh deta whatever<br>this uh like everything at Brar has been<br>a huge negotiation and a huge uh piece<br>of work not only for the studio of<br>course but for uh a number of um people<br>uh who have assisted with<br>construction uh not the least of which<br>have been the negotiations with historic<br>places and uh city council Heritage um<br>I've been part of the writing of rules<br>uh development rules for uh building<br>Mass inside of britmart uh at the time<br>that the um bid was one when we first<br>started working on badm they said well<br>you got to put some rules down you can't<br>put up 40 stories in the middle there<br>and so one of the keys was uh setting a<br>sight line from the south side of custom<br>Street and uh making sure that we didn't<br>um crowd the coordinance line or the um<br>parit line of the buildings along um<br>along c uh Customs so this parit line<br>had to be the<br>Horizon uh and so uh that set some<br>pretty ruthless controls and uh there<br>were some negotiations in order to um<br>see if we might ameliorate that in some<br>way by other strategies that would<br>engage with the Heritage buildings<br>around and uh so the breaking down of<br>the mass of the building into component<br>elements<br>and uh of course the use of the brick<br>work which was an extraordinary bit of<br>um engineering and um facade engineering<br>and architecture and involves some uh<br>extraordinary work here so this is<br>bricks being laid into a mold uh at a<br>precasting yard concrete is cast onto<br>the back of it and then the brick clad<br>paddles taken to site and offered up<br>into<br>again there is this uh issue of uh<br>humble special again um but here the<br>materials are a little less humble I<br>suspect uh so it's a very elegant<br>joinery um and some beautiful craft work<br>and here I'd like really like to<br>reference the work of Emily priest in<br>the studio who uh has made a significant<br>contribution to the way in which the<br>building<br>uses<br>uh uh local materials wherever possible<br>and to a significant degree particularly<br>with respect to Interior fit out the um<br>fabrics and uh uh artworks and um much<br>of the Interior fit out is locally<br>sourced uh so I talked before about the<br>nibbling through<br>space that uh the very first the country<br>club project uh uh heralded and so in<br>here this is the formation of a another<br>laneway connection between custom Street<br>and the center of Brit M and therefore<br>in the fullness of time we hope down to<br>the wat's edge here this is uh uh<br>seeking to obscure the difference<br>between public and private space um and<br>so it drills through an existing<br>building then dog legs around uh<br>and then opens back out onto the<br>streets uh further up in the building um<br>the windows are giving these little<br>glimpses that are of these found<br>Treasures these um the old um Warehouse<br>signage that's been revealed um the<br>staining allowed to happen the wall<br>untouched so that one sees the uh<br>foreground of the finished Timbers and<br>the brick work and then this uh sense of<br>History sitting alongside it this<br>artifact of<br>History uh and then uh deep within the<br>hotel um the bar at um kingy<br>restaurant the timber taken out of the<br>North it's uh swamp cry and uh cut<br>machined and drilled and uh lovingly<br>polished and then the light footing<br>Above So part of the project in the<br>studio has been making<br>bits and pieces uh making light fittings<br>and uh artifacts hand door handles and<br>uh all sorts of stuff like that and so<br>um we've been fortunate to have this uh<br>canvas if you like in which to mount<br>these<br>elements um about the same time I think<br>uh we're working on this building here<br>this is the old Windstone<br>building uh at the top of Simons and<br>kyber pass and uh it was a building that<br>was a heroic bit of construction in the<br>1970s and uh I think it was at a time<br>when the industry was in deep trouble<br>and about three architect practices came<br>together to to make this building uh<br>over the years it had progressively<br>fallen on harder and harder<br>times and uh it had originally some very<br>uh lovely fine uh pre-cast re uh<br>horizontal panels but they had started<br>to fail because there wasn't sufficient<br>cover on the steel and uh they been<br>covered with uh lucab<br>Bond the building and that was kind of<br>symptomatic what was happening with the<br>building as a whole it started out with<br>this heroic thing of a a shopping mall<br>there was a hotel a bar in there offices<br>uh no accommodation um but uh one of the<br>things it did do was to sit uh it's this<br>thing<br>here um this is a view from uh the where<br>the tollgates used to be on the hover<br>Bridge so that big fat part where it's<br>about 10 lanes wide and that was one of<br>the view shafts of uh mangaa and uh this<br>building was originally proposed to be<br>even higher I think about 50% higher uh<br>but was stopped uh when it was realized<br>what a imposition it would make on that<br>view of the manga and uh so even now it<br>breaks the height constraint the reason<br>those buildings are flat topped is uh<br>partly to do with this uh view shaft<br>which forms a sloping plane from one's<br>eye to a particular elevation on the<br>manga and uh we were able to make use of<br>the fact that that building uh poked<br>through the uh this height plane in<br>order to build a second stage but this<br>is the first stage where we essentially<br>pruned the building so rather than<br>trying to add stuff to it to make it<br>something and it wasn't we uh pruned the<br>uh sun shades out in favor of a higher<br>performance glass we nibbled away at the<br>corners to form outdoor Terraces so that<br>we could uh appear to be altering the<br>proportion of the building we viewed<br>from<br>afar uh<br>it's it's a composite of three three<br>projects and quite complex uh sections I<br>don't really want to discuss except that<br>uh what they do is offer or have created<br>uh a kind of<br>vertical uh layering of occupation and<br>so you have the um serious<br>um uh penthouses up the top so there's<br>lots of dough up there then you have<br>some great views<br>uh up here to about this level here and<br>then you start to get into a very<br>enclosed view because immediately on the<br>boundary there's a three or four story<br>building excuse<br>me uh and so yeah high up you get this<br>me it's on a higher very high part of of<br>the city and uh so officers enormous<br>View and it was 360 I mean you around<br>the other side of the building you look<br>out to the Manar heads but uh as I said<br>on the lower levels this building had<br>been plopped up alongside it's uh car<br>park down below and then some apartments<br>up above it this is before we' done any<br>work on the building uh and so we<br>generated the some uh what we call<br>Warehouse Apartments I'm really rather<br>pleased with the so they wrecked<br>rectangular blockes with no view<br>whatsoever other than about 7 m or so<br>across to that metallic building and so<br>we uh concentrated and trying to make<br>everything as big as we possibly<br>could and condensed all the neery rooms<br>into one playwood box which is that dark<br>outline box so it has laundry bathroom a<br>little storage and then the kitchen<br>clamped onto one side and uh no other<br>separations uh inside of there so that<br>uh people can configure bedrooms and<br>work areas and living areas as they see<br>fit and this is uh the a typical um one<br>of the Warehouse Apartments not our fit<br>out I hen to say this is done for Real<br>Estate uh but you can see there the<br>playwood box with the bathroom and so on<br>and then the kitchen on the right hand<br>side we also on the the third stage of<br>the project<br>got an opportunity to do the the great<br>over and under uh apartment so<br>circulation uh through the middle here<br>and then uh coming in and into uh one<br>room and then upstairs to an apartment<br>that goes right through and then the<br>Cory coming in here bedroom here Down<br>Apartment that goes all the way through<br>um that's lovely because it gives you<br>these apartments that uh are<br>double-sided so you get great<br>ventilation uh the other thing is that<br>you do they they're quite useful in the<br>sense that you end up this sort of is<br>sorry isolated that's a bathroom uh<br>isolated<br>bedroom uh here for example uh whereas<br>the main living is down here the main<br>bedroom down here and so they're quite<br>useful for uh the kids that come home or<br>that kind of um arrangement of U some<br>privacy<br>or or common living on the ground floor<br>and then these little isolated pods the<br>downside is there's actually quite a lot<br>of<br>staircases and<br>uh uh well that's all I need to say lot<br>of uh out west uh a lot of the work we<br>do is uh C Master planning and this is<br>on the back of britmart pretty much in<br>that<br>we gained a lot of experience with Brit<br>and also we were quite um<br>carefully uh educated or or or mentored<br>at britam M and into those things which<br>will make a<br>successful commercial environment well a<br>a successful sustainable Su sustainable<br>um public environment so at britmart for<br>example uh the developer was very keen<br>on<br>uh or very clear that we needed this<br>triumverate of um retail food and<br>beverage and then uh commercial use and<br>that they they all each needed each<br>other and uh<br>that um so that the commercial tenants<br>would um pay um commercial rates uh but<br>they their they would only be attracted<br>there if there was uh good retail for<br>the uh people working for them and<br>similarly good places to eat and drink<br>before and after<br>work uh and so that's a real prey of<br>really what is a very sophisticated<br>operation in terms of making of place<br>and the rehabilitation of britmart but<br>some of those schools were Revisited out<br>here at hobsonville point and these are<br>the old hangers here the sundelin hanger<br>on the left and the Catalina one<br>directly ahead um and these were um<br>heavily manipulated in order to form uh<br>commercial spaces out here and so this<br>is the old Catalina flyboat um hangers<br>beautiful big massive concrete things<br>with these extraordinary doors uh this<br>sort of uh this lettuce thing here um<br>whoops<br>sorry keep going um this uh lce business<br>here is part of a big door that was on a<br>wonderful bit of mechanism that would<br>roll all around uh and we kept those as<br>uh references again that's highly<br>negotiated in terms of uh Heritage use<br>and what holes we could make and uh how<br>we would reuse uh the windows and um you<br>can see I'm returning to the sort of<br>crisscross between the eye and the view<br>uh so this was<br>done um by largely by Simon mlan in the<br>studio and uh I think Lucy involved yeah<br>and uh uh so uh a lovely reconfiguration<br>of that big industrial thing uh now back<br>to the coastal Edge again and here the<br>engagement with rang aoto and um the<br>this building here that is a private<br>house again that Puda car with features<br>large gain the contractor wanted to get<br>rid of it rang me up in the middle of a<br>large storm saying it's fantastic this<br>is the night for getting rid of the tree<br>cuz he felt he could haul it over and<br>then blame the The Tempest<br>um and uh the building's really about<br>coming rambling down the cliff from the<br>uh flat uh land above on the roadside on<br>the left and uh is really a story of<br>different engagements with that Long<br>View and um circulation is up and down<br>this Lantern it's very simple party for<br>the house there's this stair Lantern a<br>big uh a wall of uh polished stone that<br>runs up and down through it and then on<br>the other side series of stacked rooms<br>starting from uh living space down to uh<br>bedrooms and then down to game Space<br>down at the bottom so you see this um<br>black thing here is the uh this wall<br>running through the building separating<br>public and private and so you know you<br>can say was a bit of Louis cans served<br>and servant spaces those things rattling<br>around uh so high up one has this Long<br>View across the uh Northern approach to<br>the harbor and out to Roto uh through<br>the living level where the trees are<br>starting to become bit more of an<br>element then one goes down starts going<br>down this uh<br>Lantern uh the trees start to obscure<br>The View and and uh manipulate the light<br>and uh then at various stages the stair<br>folds back on itself and uh as you<br>appear here uh penultimate level I think<br>it is uh the Polish of the stone<br>reflects the tree in front of you and<br>then you end up in this private Zone at<br>the<br>bottom um we Revisited that project uh I<br>don't know five or six years ago and uh<br>formed uh another Wing to it because<br>that house was very skinny just stepped<br>its way down the uh cliff and it was<br>only about I think about 8 m wide at the<br>most here we Revisited it um and the<br>this is the tree that I'm delighted as I<br>survived the uh not only the Tempest but<br>the<br>contractor uh and uh at the end of the<br>garden uh formed this<br>little um Folly it's called Uh so<br>essentially it's a garden shed with a<br>little uh Retreat tucked on the end of<br>it uh excuse me uh it sits at the<br>Northern end of the property and shields<br>the properties Beyond it and so it<br>creates this open uh lawn in the middle<br>and provides a place for one to uh<br>Retreat and so uh it's quite an<br>interesting layering of space in and out<br>uh it uh has a number of concealed<br>elements so it has a little kitchen but<br>it's tucked away has a little bathroom<br>but it's tucked away has a bed but it's<br>tucked away U they all sort of pop out<br>if one pulls critical bits of wood and<br>so on um and uh the space here which is<br>uh recycled bandor Timbers and uh<br>corrugated uh metal fireplace and you<br>know it's extraordinarily detailed and<br>luxurious but alludes to H some earlier<br>kind of more naive kind of construction<br>in it sort of uh corrugated metal and<br>the<br>fireplace uh I'm sightly embarrassed<br>about it really because because you know<br>I talk about it as if it refers to uh<br>minor U canvas structures with a<br>corrugated iron fireplace but this thing<br>here cost a bit<br>more uh but I think spacially it's quite<br>uh interesting because the the building<br>is enclosed very much by the trees that<br>uh the photograph is taken from under<br>and uh so that Terrace is really only<br>open on the left hand side and uh it has<br>a sort of filtered view back into the<br>interior space beyond that um and so it<br>is that s mediation of view again<br>between the eye and the um and the long<br>distance uh mediated by building in this<br>case those uh Asal or or little glazing<br>beads uh breaking up the large lumps of<br>glass and so a lot of the work has been<br>this um mediation of uh openness and<br>engagement with the great New Zealand<br>Outdoors but also wanting to provide a<br>place which is static and stable and so<br>this these two spaces the in outdoor<br>space and the indoor<br>space have a uh AC Qui calm about them<br>uh and yet allow you the eye and the<br>mind to tr travel to the uh wider spaces<br>beyond that oops okay been there sorry<br>uh and look I'm just returning again<br>here to the little Villa in uh Pon the<br>poor thing that's been hacked around so<br>many times uh and the creation of uh<br>what I was just saying static stable<br>space to sit um the manipulation of um<br>window in this case you can get a hint<br>of the neighbor's house a couple of<br>meters away uh path heading off that<br>way and uh the um ability to roll back<br>and um become or or to to have your um<br>Imagination your eyesight uh fly to uh<br>in this case the garden and then the<br>pathway through to the neighbors and uh<br>beyond that again the house that um Pete<br>Bosley used to live just in uh to the<br>right of that uh bamb pole but you are<br>inside uh there's no doubt about that<br>and so it's that kind of backwards and<br>forwards all the time and uh from the<br>outside looking back in the other way uh<br>and that's it that's<br>off um thank you um we're probably got<br>time for just a couple of questions but<br>I've got one to start with which is you<br>know thinking about you know that very<br>some of the very early images that you<br>started with with the kind of there's<br>really kind of little light kind of um<br>slight um uh occupation of the of these<br>kind of gigantic Landscapes and now um<br>you know uh I guess the kind of question<br>of this moment in time um thinking about<br>the occupation of the landscape are<br>there have we are the moments where you<br>would say<br>don't to occupation of the landscape<br>right yes oh well if it's done well no<br>all right no I think uh as I yeah I<br>think it depends very much on the<br>sensitivity with which one right uh<br>construction there and I I look I do<br>think it's a very fraud issue because um<br>arrogantly I would say that there is<br>quite a lot of building that is not<br>terribly sensitive to its uh impact on<br>on the land and<br>so uh you know I came from the south uh<br>and so when I arrived up here the group<br>was always seen as being the way of<br>landing on the<br>soil uh in a light fashion and making a<br>an architecture of light Timber um and<br>then there was uh Glenn merket touching<br>the Earth lightly um which I always both<br>of them were hoken really um you know I<br>thought the the the group houses were<br>pretty much packing cases that hadn't<br>really been pulled up beyond the high<br>tide mark and um I don't think<br>that um I don't think we have a history<br>of touching the Earth lightly I<br>mean to 300 years ago the hills must<br>have been alive with people digging U<br>parapets and so forth for p uh so I<br>don't I don't have any quarms about<br>digging one's heeling and uh at various<br>times Nat and I have referred to the<br>sort of<br>iconic um moment of um Don Clark digging<br>his heel into Lancaster Park ready to<br>put the pool down to boot it over you<br>know that is a um more enduring or more<br>potent Motif for me than uh the idea of<br>touching the ground lightly so yeah I<br>I'm I'm not sure that there's a place I<br>wouldn't do it<br>um but I I think one has to be very<br>careful about<br>audience okay so um that's good because<br>um we've got to celebrate um we've got<br>some food and drink waiting for us<br>outside um<br>so um thank you to jib um so it's them<br>so we'll toast jibb's Health while we<br>say contemplate putting that putting<br>that layer of jib on the outside of our<br>buildings um uh this is the last of the<br>last of the lectures for this semester<br>um what you could do is put in your<br>diary and even have a quick uh Google on<br>the phone um on July 24th we've got<br>Marlon Blackwell um who's going to be<br>our International Arch teaching in the<br>studios atool AR next semester um who's<br>amazing amazing guy uh American<br>Institute of archtics Gold Medal winner<br>um so someone that's we're very pleased<br>to be having with us so put that in your<br>diary 24th of 24th of July um thank you<br>to jib uh um thank you to p uh let one<br>round of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
