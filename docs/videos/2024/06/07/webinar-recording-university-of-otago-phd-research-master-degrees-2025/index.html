um<br>Master's and uh PhD and a post stock in<br>the US before moving deciding to move to<br>denan and it was a great decision that I<br>made my focus of my research is mostly<br>on insect behavioral ecology I study a<br>lot of bees wasps ants butterflies<br>beetles Etc uh it's a lot of fun I get<br>to get to have opportunities to work<br>with um folks from the botney Department<br>from uh the ecology program from various<br>programs in different departments lots<br>of opportunities for collaborations<br>among students and staff which I've been<br>really really thankful for since moving<br>to Cho so kot thank you and then I've<br>got Mrs bronwin Stevens from The<br>Graduate research School manager there K<br>so I'm manager of The Graduate research<br>School uh a role I've been

Joel Tindle from the<br>division of um Health Sciences Joel good<br>folks um my name is Joel Tindle I did my<br>undergraduate at MES University in<br>Melbourne did my PhD at University of<br>Queensland in brisan Australia I<br>transferred moved countries moved to<br>denan about 20 years ago um and I have a<br>research program in drug Discovery and<br>I'm based in the School of<br>Pharmacy thank you<br>Joel and uh Dr rickes benj thank you<br>Cura I'm Rakesh I'm originally from<br>India I just graduated with a PhD in<br>cancer pathology uh I started my PhD in<br>otago in<br>for okay so moving on we have a very<br>busy ER coming up so first of all I'd<br>like to introduce us University of atago<br>we are New Zealand's first University<br>for some of you who have made started<br>your PhD Journey or research Master's<br>journey and prior to last month you may<br>notice a change in our look and feel we<br>are delighted um to have a new toou or<br>symbol which is reflective of the ataco<br>harbor here in denan and our new Tero<br>name which reflects and that we are a<br>place of many<br>firsts so as I said packed agenda so I'm<br>just going to skim through this we're<br>going to start off with New Zealand a<br>little bit introduction to Denon and<br>then answer hopefully all of your<br>questions today with our fabulous panel<br>um and if we have time at the end for<br>Q&amp;A so please sit back listen cuz I'm<br>sure a lot of the questions that you<br>have today will be answered with our<br>fabulous guests and panel that reminds<br>me sorry a little bit of housekeeping<br>please use the Q&amp;A box below to write<br>your questions but just just don't do<br>those questions right now we do have a<br>live staff a hold of live team behind<br>the scenes that will be answering your<br>questions but sit back relax<br>listen I'm sure your questions are<br>actually going to be answered by this<br>fabulous panel of experts here today<br>thank<br>you okay so moving on we're going to<br>start off with New Zealand and dened so<br>delighted if some of you may some of you<br>may not know about AOA New Zealand we<br>are a population of 5 million all up and<br>we have three languages so English which<br>is in the language that we're all taught<br>in but you will also see ter Mari that<br>is our indigenous language and again<br>reflected across lots of our different<br>Publications and on our website that you<br>may see and we also have New Zealand's<br>sign language so you can see from our um<br>rankings we are very safe country and<br>we're gender equal and we are also the<br>11th happiest so there's a lot of smiles<br>here which you saw from the start today<br>so a great place to consider and doing<br>your postgraduate studies<br>in and it is very much embedded in New<br>Zealand culture that we practice the<br>mrii principles of makaki Tanga which is<br>Hospitality kindness generosity and<br>support so thinking about your future<br>studies why would you consider studying<br>in New Zealand so it's wonderful to have<br>you here today because clearly there's<br>an interest but um just to give you a<br>quick overview we have eight<br>universities in New Zealand they are all<br>public universities um it is very much a<br>worldclass education this is where you<br>will and critical thinking Hands-On<br>learning you work collaboratively and<br>already our academic staff have touched<br>on that the collaborations across<br>departments as well as divisions um and<br>what you're here for today there are<br>excellent research opportunities and<br>also inter International sorry<br>collaboration across all universities so<br>and the one thing I'd also like to<br>highlight is we were the first country<br>to adopt a strict code of practice for<br>the care of international students so<br>being International is a part of being<br>in New Zealand and you may from my<br>accent I'm originally from Scotland<br>migrated here 25 years ago and and it's<br>a wonderful country to live in so where<br>are we located we are in the lower part<br>of the South Island as reflected in our<br>name we are a place of many firsts so<br>first University in the country and we<br>are in the city of of denan or in Tero<br>Mari OT um and it is a wonderful<br>University City so we have a population<br>of<br>130,000 and 25,000 of those are students<br>so it's an incredibly vibrant place to<br>study as well as the number of academic<br>staff that we have here um we are we<br>love it here this you can see that from<br>the panel that um you you've just met um<br>and we really have a great lifestyle<br>we're a small City everything's<br>accessible within 10 to 15 minutes<br>driving so very easy to get around and<br>explore our beautiful backy yard and<br>this gives you an overview of what our<br>city looks like just as a touch point to<br>give you a bit of an<br>indication and some of our snapshots of<br>city life so that's enough about um den<br>and New Zealand and now we're going to<br>touch on why consider a Tagle thank you<br>Sarah so as uh Sarah pointed out we are<br>one of um eight government universities<br>and know Targo was the first University<br>to be established we've been teaching<br>students for all nearly 154 years now<br>and uh we're very proud of our um Qs<br>world rankings and we're ranked still as<br>top 1% of universities<br>worldwide um the student body is made up<br>of um International students and<br>domestic students and you can see there<br>that we have a very high number of PhD<br>students nearly 1,400 choose otago to<br>study in now when we talk about Oto<br>there is we're talking about the main<br>campus of denen but there are two other<br>campuses as well that research students<br>can go and study and we will talk a<br>little bit about that in the in future<br>slides and um we are very research<br>intensive University but we take our um<br>teaching very seriously and uh with Qs<br>stars with Five Star Plus which um shows<br>the very good quality um<br>rating so uh Qs rankings world rankings<br>came out yesterday and we're ranked 214<br>or the second highest ranked University<br>in New Zealand I think this shows that<br>we're a very well um sort of diverse<br>range of programs that are very highly<br>ranked right across the university for<br>sure so as I was saying before there are<br>three main campuses for graduate<br>research denan is the majority of where<br>students will come and study but we do<br>also have campuses in Christ Church and<br>Wellington<br>so as I was saying before we're very<br>research intensive and we might be at<br>the almost the bottom of the world I<br>think there's a small University in<br>Patagonia that just Feats us but it<br>doesn't matter that we're in the<br>southern hemisphere we are globally<br>connected and from the introductions of<br>the academic staff here it just shows<br>you that um you'll be taught supervised<br>by not just New Zealand academics but<br>academics from around the world and you<br>may also be involved in research around<br>the world as well from our partner<br>universities okay moving now on to<br>research at a Tagle um but I'm just<br>going to touch on the four this sort of<br>key academic divisions that we have here<br>so hopefully there's something for<br>everybody um online today we have Health<br>Sciences science business and<br>Humanities and Professor Joel is going<br>to talk about our research groups so we<br>have quite a few different research<br>areas and named research groups uh this<br>slide is showing our centers of research<br>Excellence so these are nationwide um<br>centers funded by the government<br>specifically our dods wall Center for<br>photonic and Quantum Technologies<br>centering around uh physics research as<br>well as Coastal People Southern<br>skies in addition to the um the national<br>centers we have research centers and<br>research themes and you can see an<br>extensive list of differing areas of<br>research um from my area particularly in<br>health science uh the Heart Institute<br>there's pain one Health aloa global<br>global Health Institute uh<br>neuroendocrinology and a whole lot more<br>there and drilling down there's there's<br>more there I think I've already<br>mentioned pain Pacific Health New<br>Zealand ocean acidification research uh<br>catchment management so the areas are<br>diverse okay so that gives you a touch<br>point in some of our um Sciences of<br>research but we have research<br>collaborations across all of our<br>departments and divisions as well there<br>just some of the key<br>ones okay so on to research degrees<br>certainly Roman would you like to touch<br>on um the different postgraduate<br>qualifications there are certainly so um<br>we have a at the top there the doctoral<br>degree the PHD um which is a minimum of<br>3 years can take longer depending on how<br>long it takes you to get through your<br>research and your data collection uh we<br>also have a research thesis Master<br>that's usually a 12-month um some<br>students can come in and do coursework<br>and then onto their research um that<br>would be minimum two years we also have<br>taught Masters and postgraduate degrees<br>but our main focus today is on the<br>research based<br>qualifications you also have<br>um other so so our master's research is<br>a one-year program as thesis only<br>usually one supervisor uh a great<br>preparation for the PHD um and in some<br>circumstances you can also possibly<br>upgrade to the PHD uh after a minimum of<br>eight months of<br>study so there's more about the PHD um 3<br>to four year program um we talk about<br>our average times uh later on roughly<br>three and a half years by thesis only um<br>there aren't usually talk talk papers in<br>the PHD um and you can see there it's<br>you know single disciplined inter or<br>interdisciplinary um and good<br>preparation for becoming an academic if<br>that is what you're after we also have<br>some professional doctorates we've got<br>the deand dent uh the dma which is the<br>musical arts DBA which is business one<br>and the Ed which is an education so they<br>usually the course workor and research<br>they for three to four year programs<br>often with one or two years of of papers<br>and then onto um a thesis similar to a a<br>PhD<br>thesis so some of the benefits of<br>research students studying in New<br>Zealand and if you you're not aware is<br>that if you come in and you're going to<br>do a master by research immigration New<br>Zealand allows you to work full-time<br>while studying and you're also eligible<br>for a three-year poststudy work visa<br>after graduation so please if you are<br>applying for a research Master please<br>check your Visa conditions and um look<br>at the immigration using website for PhD<br>students you you pay domestic fees<br>you're not paying international fees our<br>New Zealand government subsidizes you if<br>you have children between the age of<br>five and 18 which is basically um school<br>years then your children can go into New<br>Zealand schools government schools and<br>pay domestic fees only you too will be<br>able to work full-time while studying<br>and you are also eligible for the<br>three-year poststudy work visa but once<br>again please check immigration New<br>Zealand website and please check your<br>visa okay moving now into the admission<br>application process so eligibility for<br>admission and what we're looking for for<br>academic requirements<br>so first of all for a um a masters by<br>thesis only we really do need to see<br>that you've got a Bachelor's completed a<br>bachelor with honors either first or<br>upper upper second class or if you've<br>done a master's degree you also need to<br>for master's degree you need to have a<br>GPA of at least a B+ this is a Notaro<br>equivalent they will also look at the<br>research component of your um your<br>either your honors degree um or if<br>you've done your master's as well and<br>that research component must be at least<br>workload for PhD and for your research<br>Masters when it comes to English<br>language requirements we're looking for<br>an IELTS of 6.5 with no individual ban<br>below six we also they take total 90<br>with a minimum writing score of 21 and<br>there are other equivalent tests like<br>pte which we also<br>take you can get a conditional offer so<br>um you get a conditional offer on your<br>academic requirements and um then with<br>your conditional offer you can then sit<br>your English<br>language um exams or we've also got um<br>English for otaro which is done through<br>the University of Oto Language Center um<br>but you must have an Oto conditional<br>offer first of all before applying for<br>English for Taro so English for Taro is<br>all internally assessed um it's about 15<br>weeks of preparation if you pass your<br>English for otaro then our language send<br>us um sends the results to admissions<br>and then your conditional offer becomes<br>unconditional and all of this<br>information is available on our website<br>under internet AAL so you can check out<br>all the um English language um tests<br>that we<br>accept Okay so how do you submit your<br>application we don't have paper<br>applications at otago it's all online so<br>you go to the website and basically the<br>first thing you need to do is you can<br>there will be apply now buttons but<br>we're going to talk about this some more<br>detail during the panel discussion but<br>the first thing is whether it's a<br>research master or a PhD is you need to<br>secure<br>supervision then after you've secured<br>supervision you then make the formal<br>admission application through evision<br>that's your student<br>portal then after you've made the formal<br>admission then um you submit having<br>uploaded all your documents and it takes<br>you through the application will take<br>you through the questions of the<br>documents that they're looking for<br>submit and then there's a whole sort of<br>lot a whole lot of sort of internal red<br>tape that The Graduate research school<br>does all right okay so now we're moving<br>on to the question we probably get asked<br>most often when um we're speaking to<br>scholarships okay so the University of<br>aago doctoral scholarship I'm delighted<br>to say that we have up to 164 of these<br>it's a fee waiver for three years and<br>you also get a living stipend of $<br>32,5<br>44 again this information is available<br>on our website um there are um sort of<br>different things you have to do for this<br>and but this just to let you know that<br>the scholarship panel meets quarterly<br>now so dependent on where you are with<br>your application process of when the<br>actual outcome of the University of ATO<br>scholarship um is given<br>so and then we've also got the<br>university ofo inter International<br>Master's research scholarships which Vic<br>can explain much more eloquently than I<br>can too sure about that but I'll give it<br>a go so as you can see it says a a fee<br>waver there captain at domestic tuition<br>fee so that means say for example your<br>the international fee for a master's<br>research program is<br>37,000 and domestic is 7,000 so it is<br>wave that 7,000 is wavered so you'd<br>still need to pay<br>30,000 but you are also given as part of<br>your scholarship that stien that living<br>fee of 18,000 just over 18,000 which is<br>great which means you probably don't<br>have to do any part-time work on the<br>side um you can concentrate on your<br>research Masters and getting that thesis<br>in we also have the manari New Zealand<br>scholarships now these are not otaro<br>scholarships they're funded by the New<br>Zealand government the full scholarships<br>covering tuition living costs and<br>flights and we've got the list of<br>eligible countries up there for more<br>information about the monarchi New<br>Zealand scholarships please um contact<br>basically go online Google monari New<br>Zealand scholarships and there's more<br>information there but basically the next<br>application period um is basically will<br>be February next year they closed for<br>2025 so you'd be looking at coming to<br>study 2026 and they open very early next<br>year but there's also lots of other<br>funding opportunities dependent on your<br>home country and where you're from<br>certainly for myself I look after the<br>region of Indonesia um and you've got<br>your LPD scholarships as well there and<br>there's many more so please check out<br>your home country um options available<br>to you okay so we've done enough talking<br>so we are going to pass it out to our<br>panel discussion now because we know<br>that's what you're here for today and<br>we're going to kick off with topic<br>number one so again we've got our<br>panelists that we introduced you um to<br>earlier on who are going to um answer<br>the questions that have been submitted<br>to us so topic number one ve lead this<br>discussion okie dokie so this topic is<br>all about um supervisor and getting your<br>supervisor uh we get a lot of questions<br>from students asking about this all the<br>time<br>so uh first of all um Joel is it<br>compulsory to confirm a supervisor<br>before a student applies generally yes<br>you need to identify the supervisor such<br>that um the process can move forward<br>that we can acknowledge that you have<br>found someone who's willing to take you<br>on to to Mentor you in the research that<br>you've chosen okay Jenny how should a<br>student approach yourself or other<br>supervisors other academics as a<br>potential supervisor so I get a lot of<br>emails from people um interested in<br>working in my lab which is awesome I'm<br>super popular I guess um no big deal but<br>um uh generally you know step one and<br>there are some very simple things you<br>can do to begin with um spell the<br>person's name<br>correctly and uh and you can use you can<br>say deer you can say you know you can<br>use your hello whatever you want um dear<br>Dr y and just make sure it's spelled<br>correctly next you want to tell a little<br>bit about you give a brief bio about<br>yourself um about your background not<br>too long nobody's nobody's you know you<br>keep in mind that uh we get a lot of<br>emails and you want us to be able to<br>read to the end so a couple of sentences<br>about your background um maybe and then<br>a couple of sentences and this is really<br>important about why you're interested in<br>working with that person what was it you<br>can say that you went to their website<br>and it was interesting<br>but what aspect of their research did<br>you find interesting what area could you<br>see yourself fitting into um and what is<br>your timeline and apply you know make<br>sure you include your a current CV with<br>your um uh with your email and and and<br>yeah but keep it keep it short keep it<br>very to the point if the person is has<br>availability um and and they get to the<br>end they're going to email you and<br>they're going to continue that<br>conversation and ask for more so you<br>want to make sure that they get through<br>all of it and writing that email is is<br>is tough it's not a simple thing I<br>remember when I was applying for PhD I<br>went through multiple drafts of that<br>email um and and had lots got lots of<br>feedback on it before I was even ready<br>to send it to the first person and we<br>know that you're likely to apply to more<br>than just AO University although I don't<br>know why you would but um so just be<br>aware that those emails that do go out<br>um they don't feel like a form letter<br>that you that you're you know sending to<br>all in Sury so double check um where<br>you're sending it and you know I I know<br>I've had somewh I've said where the<br>where the person has said i' I'd like to<br>study at the at your university<br>university of such and such and it's not<br>a tago um so it be be quite accurate um<br>with those details and also it's a<br>research degree so it's important to<br>show in the email that you've done a<br>little bit of research around the<br>supervisor in their research does it<br>actually match what you're doing so<br>always do a little bit more research<br>than you<br>think<br>okay I know you guys get so many emails<br>and you were talking about that as well<br>jny um what happens if they don't what's<br>the timeline what should they expect of<br>getting hearing back from someone<br>um and and what happens if they don't<br>hear back from a supervisor so do a la<br>at a time because we're all quite busy<br>um and so we're not on top of our emails<br>um so do allow a little bit of time<br>sometimes what might be happening is<br>that the person that you sent it to has<br>actually forwarded it to other people in<br>their Department that may have capacity<br>so that may also cause some delay so you<br>know it doesn't hurt to send a a polite<br>followup but allow a good of time um say<br>I don't know 3 weeks would you say 3 to<br>four weeks is is is probably appropriate<br>um certainly after only a week of not<br>hearing anything if you then send a hey<br>what's going on I haven't heard from you<br>it's likely to be like okay maybe maybe<br>we don't have capacity um so just be<br>aware of that I mean the other the other<br>thing is unfortunately we can't take<br>everyone um sort of braides aside we can<br>only take a a certain number of students<br>per year so in one situation um the lab<br>might be full and we just simply don't<br>have capacity to take anymore so be<br>aware of that too please I would also<br>say before you send that follow-up and I<br>get a lot of follow-up emails and I I<br>appreciate them because it means that<br>they're they're actually interested but<br>before you send that follow-up take<br>another look at that initial email was<br>it very generic could you be more<br>specific could you have tailored it a<br>bit more I'm not saying rewrite it<br>but have a think about what's what's in<br>the email is that how you want to best<br>uh represent yourself um and then send<br>send along that nud but<br>um<br>yeah I sometimes tell students that<br>think of it like a job interview and<br>take your time as you said writing that<br>cover letter maybe do you do you think<br>maybe they could because they're coming<br>from a university get academics or<br>someone to critique it and um before but<br>have someone look at it for sending it<br>out to you guys would that be helpful or<br>100% yeah so that's what that's what I<br>used to do and I know that there are<br>some of the scientific societies are now<br>trying to set up support structures to<br>help students with that so if you don't<br>have something like that at your<br>University um expand a little bit to see<br>if you can find um a support unit that<br>that's out there to help with those<br>letter writing or just to ask people to<br>give a read through that's a really good<br>not in that initial email you further<br>down the track yeah yeah but and I would<br>say don't send referees reports send a<br>name for a referee such that we can<br>contact them independently because<br>whilst they we trust everyone that<br>everything's above board we don't<br>necessarily know that they're written by<br>that uh referee just as you would for<br>job applications contact me directly<br>great<br>Okay so we've already sort of touched on<br>this ays about what you should include<br>um I guess the one thing is what would<br>you value when you're considering a<br>prospective candidate I know you've<br>talked about you making sure you've done<br>your research before um making sure the<br>name is spelled correctly because that's<br>really important and and for a lot of<br>our students in markets I know you may<br>use different you might be dear sir dear<br>Madam in New Zealand we really do we<br>like to see a name because it's<br>personalized and that's the way that<br>that we work in this part of the world<br>is there anything else you'd like to<br>add um academic transcript I don't think<br>we've talked about that um but certainly<br>having having your CV and an academic<br>transcript as the bare minimum means<br>that the supervisor can at least work<br>out whether or not you even meet the<br>minimum<br>criteria I think also it's you're<br>starting a conversation so keep that in<br>mind in the email and that so I'd like<br>to do some research in the area that<br>you're um having expertise in say it's<br>infectious diseases so I'm interested in<br>your work in X Y and Z as opposed to<br>saying I want to do some research with<br>you and it's like I my first reaction is<br>why what is it about my research that<br>interests you so you're starting that<br>conversation and trust me researchers do<br>like to talk about their research so you<br>start the conversation then we'll keep<br>going I I go go ahead uh from a student<br>point of view as well like I remember<br>when I was applying for my PhD positions<br>and stuff like that um I would read<br>about their research uh on the website<br>but of course like on the website we<br>don't have like a lot of information so<br>at least I would try if I'm really<br>really passionate about that supervisor<br>research I would try and read at least<br>one of the papers that they have<br>published and I would approach them in a<br>way asking them like a question or like<br>a doubt that I have with respect to the<br>paper as well so that would somehow like<br>show the supervisor that I'm interested<br>and that would technically like even<br>answer my question so it would be more<br>like as Joel mentioned like more like<br>initiating a conversation rather than a<br>proper job application application I'm<br>show that you're capable of that<br>research that's yeah that's nice to he<br>yeah one of the things that we often do<br>so I have my own uh Lab website but then<br>I also have information on the<br>department page of what I do in my<br>interests and there's two points I want<br>to make first of all those that<br>information isn't always up to date so<br>what you suggested by going and reading<br>through some literature um my suggestion<br>builds off of that which is go to the<br>Google Scholar and look at the most<br>recent Publications to see what that lab<br>is currently doing um the second thing<br>is oftentimes what we're encouraged to<br>do um as um on our<br>websites is to highlight potential<br>projects and typically when I highlight<br>potential projects in my lab I'm<br>highlighting those for master students<br>or prospective Masters honors PG dip<br>students I'm expecting of PhD applicants<br>to not necessarily say I'd like to work<br>on this one project that you've<br>suggested on your website I'm hoping for<br>a PhD student to come in and say I found<br>this really interesting I'd like to work<br>in this space it's a little bit of<br>Independence a little bit of creativity<br>a little bit of of of your own<br>initiative now that's me though I think<br>there are other professors who do things<br>differently so don't don't panic too<br>much about creating that narrative when<br>you first submit that initial email but<br>you do want to make sure when I say that<br>you know have those couple of sentences<br>of why you want to be there make sure<br>that it's<br>personalized it's honest and it's what<br>you actually want to do I have to agree<br>with Jenny<br>um some a little being a little bit<br>broad of what's going on in the lab so<br>you've done the research about the lab<br>but also at least in my mind the perfect<br>PhD student would come to you with a<br>project that you might not be doing but<br>you'd be good to<br>supervise absolutely St that's very<br>student driven um but we have to be able<br>to supervise that specifically so we may<br>not but uh in those cases we might be<br>able to um direct you depending on where<br>cool so so they've part of also<br>approaching you too is you want to see<br>the proposal as well and and you touched<br>on that too and've been giving tips um<br>expand on that Joel of how to make your<br>research proposal stand out so you<br>probably wouldn't start with a research<br>proposal a couple sentences around the<br>research that you'd be interested in<br>doing supervisor might say okay we're<br>not doing that project anymore but we've<br>got something that's been related so we<br>can work on that and once you get the<br>dialogue going the research proposal<br>would come from that and I would help<br>the student to develop that for the<br>application<br>itself yep so it's not an initial query<br>including the thesis proposal it is more<br>it's more about finding that that<br>supervisor and working out if you can<br>actually develop something further from<br>that and here so we're just looking if<br>we're just looking at the topic then<br>okay we're going to look at this disease<br>and make some molecules there or<br>something different<br>um yeah the The Proposal itself comes<br>with the application and that develops<br>over<br>time<br>great um we get a lot of these questions<br>as well all the time so can I apply for<br>a research position to work with one of<br>oto's academic<br>staff um<br>Jenny how would you answer that one so<br>um you can apply for a research position<br>to work with aago academic staff full<br>stop that research uh that you get paid<br>to do though can't<br>be is is not supposed to be used as part<br>of your PhD research thesis the the<br>research that you conduct for your PhD<br>should be unpaid unless you're getting a<br>scholarship that yeah y perfect I'd<br>agree ask scholarship to important when<br>you're looking at so I personally don't<br>want my students to have to work<br>full-time as a student um<br>because I mean doing a doing a postgrad<br>is hard it's the hardest thing in your<br>life um doing a postgrad<br>internationally is even harder and do<br>doing a postgrad while you're also<br>worried about um finances is is mentally<br>unstable it's not it's not it's I just<br>yeah I don't think it's responsible so<br>personally I prefer my students to come<br>in with a scholarship because I don't<br>want them to have to have that<br>additional burden um but uh you you<br>that's not a requirement so generally<br>what I do when I talk to the students as<br>they approach me<br>as I we talk about the the financial um<br>burden that will come with both moving<br>overseas living into denan as well as<br>you know um being a student here and and<br>the importance of that scholarship and<br>the opportunities for for temporary for<br>for additional employment on top of that<br>as well which you can have um but<br>because once you know so we can agree<br>that you'll be a student but you don't<br>you won't know about that scholarship<br>until after after you apply now you're<br>welcome if you don't get the scholarship<br>to still come to aago and I would still<br>be your<br>supervisor but it's it's going to be a<br>struggle so building on from that<br>essentially the admission process and<br>the scholarships process sort of run<br>independent of each other um and an<br>admission can't be subject to them<br>subject to receiving a scholarship<br>because you know as we know um you could<br>come self-funded so so the so the<br>admission is is dealt with separately so<br>it's more up to you to make that<br>decision um when you're coming um can I<br>actually afford to come here if I've<br>been declined for a scholarship is there<br>another way that I can do this and self<br>fund and it is a good idea to be<br>realistic about the costs involved and I<br>do know others so that my you know I<br>shared with you my philosophy but I know<br>other faculty who have the absolute the<br>the exact opposite philosophy as as well<br>they want to make you know so so just<br>make sure that you're um your the<br>supervisor that you're thinking of<br>working with is very clear with you<br>about the financial um<br>opportunities if if you don't get a<br>scholarship I think too a lot of<br>students are mature and they they bring<br>families with them as well so you've got<br>those extra stresses too and finding uh<br>so I had a student who arrived here from<br>Nigeria last year and she was planning<br>to bring a family her family over with<br>her and finding housing is is<br>complicated enough especially in a new<br>country finding housing for a f a<br>four-person family was on a on a<br>scholarship budget<br>is um difficult so um the scholarship<br>isn't designed to to cover to cover the<br>whole family right yeah<br>exactly anybody else anything to add on<br>this no we're all good he excellent so<br>there are other ways that you can search<br>opportunities as well um which are on<br>our website this is a snapshot of them<br>here and we'll touch on these when we<br>talk a bit more in depth about our<br>graduate research school as well so<br>again media experties database as well<br>but that doesn't necessarily showcase<br>all the opportunities that are<br>available okay so we have already<br>touched on scholarships so again very<br>important topic that we get asked all<br>the time about when we're offshore so um<br>Bing on to hearing about what's the most<br>important criteria for scholarships and<br>essentially it is GP the GPA um so you<br>know what we're looking for in in order<br>to get into the PHD is is a minimum of a<br>B+ uh in order to be competitive enough<br>for a scholarship you're really looking<br>to have a a GPA of around about an eight<br>um so an a um GPA a to A+ um<br>unfortunately we don't have um a you<br>know a bucket of money to to throw at it<br>so we do we are quite limited um<br>Publications also come into it so it<br>depends on your you know your overall<br>experience is looked at um and then as<br>far as the the panel is concerned we<br>also look at uh you know the support<br>that you have from your department uh<br>and how your um thesis topics going to<br>be strategically important for that<br>particular Department as as<br>well and as I said before the the<br>scholarships process and the admission<br>process sort of run um kind of parallel<br>um so you you hear about your<br>scholarship outcome so at the moment<br>they are um courtly we've got a round<br>that closed on the 1 of 1 of June um the<br>decisions will be made by the end of<br>June so it's usually about a month it<br>takes about a month after the closing<br>date um but you need to have a a program<br>offer in order to get that official<br>outcome notification of the the<br>scholarship<br>fantastic okay so um another topic we<br>have if you previously studied a masters<br>by coursework what should I do to be<br>PhD so a coursework masters is one that<br>doesn't include a research component so<br>what we're what we're looking for for a<br>PhD entry is that you've got a research<br>component equivalent to 25% of a Year's<br>work um so if your Masters is totally<br>cour work with without that research<br>component then the other ways of finding<br>entry would be um through research<br>experience such as Publications um or<br>even work experience so if you've worked<br>as a lecturer um something like that for<br>a couple of years then um then that<br>could be a possibility as well um it may<br>also depend on what you've done prior to<br>that so it might just not just be your<br>Masters it might be that you have a<br>postgraduate honors qualification that<br>that could be used as an equivalence um<br>and um if you don't meet the criteria so<br>if you do have a coursework masters and<br>you don't have a research background<br>then the alternative is that you look at<br>doing a research Masters um and as<br>mentioned before you there is that<br>possibility of of upgrading to a PhD<br>when you're at least eight months along<br>the track um the downside to that is<br>that that is classs international phase<br>domestic okay and then Rakesh a day in<br>the life of a research stent did a Tagle<br>talk us through it yeah I think it's<br>like um very different for different<br>research students uh but overall it's<br>like I think the best word that I can<br>use to describe uh a day in the life of<br>a research student like specifically a<br>PhD student would be flexible um I think<br>you can talk to your supervisor and<br>decide on the time that you want to be<br>in the lab but usually it's like 9 to 5<br>at least for the first year because<br>that's when um you need to interact with<br>like your other lab members you want to<br>interact with your other supervisors<br>there's a lot of admin stuff uh and also<br>you're reading a lot of literature and<br>stuff but once you get into like lab<br>work you can talk to your um supervisor<br>and like plan on something like in my<br>case there were certain experiments that<br>I had to do overnight so I would come to<br>the lab like later in the evening and<br>work the whole night and then maybe take<br>the day off like in the morning and then<br>come back at night so you can just like<br>talk through with that and then um uh<br>each PhD student has like a specific<br>office that you share uh with like other<br>PhD students who you have been given a<br>system like a laptop or a computer so<br>you can work on that anytime you want<br>you have access 247 so you can go to<br>your office Anytime and work at any<br>moment but initially it's usually 9: to<br>5: and then you can after 5 or like<br>whenever you finish your work you can<br>just go back uh to your flat um and then<br>chill have a good time um it's usually<br>like that for like the first two years<br>and then it gets crazy so it's fine but<br>crazy not not to worry about like um but<br>then you start like you are on the<br>process and the mindset of finishing<br>your PhD so you start enjoying like your<br>life becomes your lab or like your space<br>wherever it is but then um it's all like<br>flexible it's all about time management<br>um so you can just do the thing that's<br>works well with you as long as your<br>supervisor and you are on the same page<br>and of course not everybody has lab<br>based um research uh and I guess there<br>is a tendency to just stay at home and<br>and and work on it um I would say having<br>having seen and dealt with a number of<br>students especially International<br>students uh it is a good idea to<br>actually come and be on campus and and<br>be involved and um you know meet people<br>um isolation is really difficult um<br>we've certainly seen an increase in uh<br>in issues of isolation since Co sort of<br>made us isolated um so it yeah it it is<br>really useful to actually make use of<br>the the facilities that are are<br>available to you the first year the PhD<br>students have to prove themselves still<br>don't they it's not yes yeah you<br>provisional um for that first year<br>there's certain um tasks that you need<br>to meet it might be that you need to do<br>a um a literature review you might need<br>to do a presentation um to a panel in<br>your in your office um in your<br>department uh various different things<br>before you become confirmed as a as a<br>PhD student so usually there is like a<br>first six months review meeting and then<br>there's a one year that's when you get<br>confirmed like that's when uh your<br>committee uh your supervisor committee<br>and your PhD committee will have like a<br>meeting with you where you have to<br>present and submit a report of what you<br>have done over the period of one year<br>and also you have to have like a<br>literature review ready as well but<br>again that's like specific to different<br>supervisors and departments um and<br>that's when you more or less are like<br>technically confirmed and then you have<br>meetings every year which is also good<br>because then your entire committee is<br>also on the same page as you and then<br>there's like a clear idea of what you're<br>doing and when you're doing so it's very<br>good to like plan ahead of time and like<br>manage your time very well and building<br>up that relationship with your<br>supervisor definitely useful um I think<br>I don't know from your perspective<br>normally it be the weekly or fortnightly<br>meetings that that you'd have with your<br>with your students um and take minutes<br>yes yeah Student please take minutes<br>during that so you know where you're at<br>and what you're doing um but yeah<br>setting up those those um there's a uh<br>within your first six months you also<br>complete a student supervisor agreement<br>and that sets up those you know those<br>relationships who does what who takes<br>the lead certain areas<br>fantastic so we've talked a lot about um<br>how to apply and what it looks like but<br>I think really what we exhale at as a<br>tago as a support that we have um here<br>and again that goes across New Zealand<br>but we have got phenomenal support for<br>post-graduate research um students again<br>bran is very big in this space so we're<br>going to pass it um over to her to let<br>you you know what we've got at a tarle<br>yes so so I touched on earlier about our<br>completion rates so the minimum um um<br>completion time for PhD is 3 years so um<br>so it's at that threee Mark that you can<br>actually submit your thesis you've got<br>up until four years before things start<br>getting hairy um and and um our average<br>submission uh is around the 3.4 Mark The<br>Sciences do tend to take that that<br>slightly longer than than some of the<br>other areas um but that is and and just<br>keep in mind that the scholarship<br>stipend is only for three years so if<br>you are going to take more than that um<br>3 years to to hand in um you will may<br>need to self fund for some of that as<br>well um yeah okay so the graduate<br>research school so this is very much<br>supporting that research at a Tagle and<br>The Graduate wellbe coach yes so within<br>graduate research school we have um we<br>very small team actually we've got a got<br>two half time Deans at the moment and<br>I'm the manager um we've got um support<br>available for Mari and in Pacific island<br>students but we've also got a graduate<br>well-being coach we're actually really<br>um pretty chuffed actually to have this<br>because we're this is fairly unique to<br>aaro to have a graduate well-being coach<br>specifically for uh our graduate<br>students um and yeah I believe um jinny<br>and rkes have got you've actually get<br>some dealings yes I feel like um PhD is<br>stressful like it is like it's it's no<br>joke um and there would come a time<br>possibly in your PhD where you're like<br>really stressed uh and it's very normal<br>like every PhD goes through it uh but<br>what's interesting is like to have<br>someone outside of your department and<br>outside of your supervision because at<br>times you would like definitely feel<br>like oh if I talk to my supervisor<br>about my stress I wouldn't warn my<br>supervisor to think that I'm not capable<br>enough to do my PhD or finish my PhD<br>it's very understandable so The Graduate<br>well-being coach comes to play there uh<br>they have no idea they are not like<br>directly related to you so you can be<br>like as free as you want and you can<br>talk to them about what you're going<br>through and like how you can manage it<br>better and whatever the problem is I<br>have used it like more than twice during<br>my PhD and I think like everyone should<br>like even if you have having a good time<br>you can just go and talk to them of like<br>how you're having a good time it just<br>gets<br>better un suffers from imposter syndrome<br>different stes don't know I was gonna uh<br>just add to that real briefly so you had<br>mentioned about one of the one of the<br>things with being a PhD student is the<br>the the flexibility and I think that<br>that's um a really good skill to to grow<br>into but it's a challenge and the Brad<br>well-being coach can also help with time<br>management they can help with with um<br>various other stressors that are coming<br>in they can also go in um I've talked to<br>them too as the supervisor for you know<br>for you know my students might have been<br>struggling and so they might reach out<br>to me and they might reach out as a<br>mediator with the supervisor um and and<br>speaking of mediators there's also<br>mediators available if you do end up<br>having any kind of issues with your<br>supervisors we try to set up a lot of<br>different tiers of support so that if<br>you're if you're struggling to<br>communicate with the person that you've<br>come here to work with we find ways to<br>either either fix that communication or<br>get you somewhere that's that's more<br>comfortable more appropriate okay<br>fantastic now I'm conscious of time<br>because we've only got 10 minutes left<br>so we're going to scoot through these<br>fairly quickly and so there is lots of<br>different external um things available<br>to you so we we'll just scoot through<br>these like I say to get on to the other<br>St so we've got three minute thesis<br>competitions and most importantly check<br>out our graduate research School website<br>so much information is on there the<br>application process how to find a<br>supervisor that is your key reference<br>point for a Tagle that will be able to<br>help you we have a fabulous higher<br>education development center again and<br>used by so many different students and<br>lots of different support there um<br>external to your academic support as<br>well as well as all the different work<br>of training opportunities and<br>professional development that's there as<br>well and not forgetting our fabulous<br>Library services and resources for<br>postgraduate students who have seven<br>University libraries on campus they're<br>specialized Librarians and so they're<br>there to help student support and<br>services the list goes on for support<br>and we also have a dedicated<br>international student support team um<br>that especially if you are thinking of<br>coming with a family it is a big step<br>there's a lot of factors to consider<br>we've touched on that briefly but they<br>can assist you there if you are choosing<br>to come with the family what you need to<br>go through through Etc as well as Visa<br>support and the joy of being a Health<br>Sciences University is we have fantastic<br>um Student Health on campus as well as a<br>great Hospital Etc around us and then<br>last but not least moving on to where<br>would you live what sort of prices um<br>and living costs so Vic do you want to<br>talk a little bit about UNIF sure so for<br>our postgraduate students we've got uni<br>Flats so they are little houses they<br>aren't flats and your the university is<br>your landlord they manage them they um<br>are all walking distance to and from the<br>campus the fully furnished and your<br>weekly rent includes your uh utilities<br>so really the only extra expense is um<br>paying for food uh we do have a small<br>sort of uh small number of housing for<br>families um we have couples but the<br>majority of our housing you'll be with<br>other what we call flatmates other<br>students as well in that accommodation<br>too so you're cooking together Etc Y and<br>then there's also private accommodation<br>being in the city um again there can be<br>some guidance on that so please um if<br>you're thinking of coming with a family<br>there are multiple steps involved there<br>so please bear that in mind we touched<br>on UNIF Flats um again tuition fees and<br>cost of living so if you're looking at<br>doing a research Masters you can see the<br>cost there they do vary dependent on<br>which divis Vision that you are in or<br>Department um New Zealand is very<br>generous that our government subsidizes<br>our International students to pay<br>domestic um tuition fees so you can see<br>the range there again and cost of living<br>now um inflation is everywhere um New<br>Zealand immigration will ask for<br>$20,000 for your student visa to be<br>honest it's probably more like 25 now<br>and to give you a good cost of living um<br>and dependent on where you're from an<br>exchange rate that will be affordable or<br>not affordable but it gives you a good<br>idea of of what it costs for you to live<br>here so we are um nearly at the end<br>today and we've got a couple more<br>minutes and that we have got some<br>questions that have come through that we<br>could put out to the panel so thank you<br>for submitting them today it's great to<br>see so many of you online and who've<br>stayed with us for for our time and<br>we'll get through a couple questions<br>before we wrap it up at 5 okay so the<br>first one is and this is open to to all<br>of you is it compulsory to have a<br>publication to be accepted into a PhD<br>program no no nice and easy it's a no<br>people I<br>know oh this is an interesting one how<br>are Innovations and patents processed<br>and what is the share for the students<br>in this<br>process Joel<br>so if my memory serves me correctly um<br>as a student you would start out and you<br>own your own work however um I asked my<br>students if they'd like to to offer um<br>their IP to the university and in that<br>scenario the I the university would act<br>on their behalf so there's support there<br>should something head towards<br>commercialization and I think it's a<br>oneir one3 one3 split but that's quite a<br>while back since I looked at<br>that so it'll be third to the university<br>third to the um lab and a third to the<br>inventors<br>right okay um where can PhD students<br>collect data for their research is it<br>from New Zealand or is it can it be from<br>home countries or other countries and<br>will there be any funding for data<br>collection so it it can be from home<br>countries um so in that that three-year<br>period that your PhD is done in um you<br>are able to spend up to 12 months<br>offshore uh and still be classed as<br>domestic rates domestic fees and that is<br>usually for the purpose of of research<br>um so data Gathering etc etc so we<br>absolutely you could um you you know<br>come here do your your um research<br>methodology and and literature review<br>and then head off uh and collect your D<br>offshore and then come back and do the<br>write up effectively okay as far as help<br>and support for that um there are<br>limited funds um at the University so it<br>does depend on uh what sort of research<br>funding is available in the department<br>um it may be that you need to fund a lot<br>of that yourself um most departments<br>would have funds up to $2,000 over the<br>over the lifetime of your uh PhD to<br>enable you to go to a conference um so<br>there are some funds available but you<br>you do need to be conscious that you may<br>need to fund some of it yourself okay I<br>think we've got time for one more<br>question we oh maybe more um someone was<br>listening and I've put the fear of God<br>into them about that um they have to<br>they can fail after one year of PhD so<br>what is the major cause of this Pro a<br>problem how how can I not become like<br>this you um so I think it's uh you H<br>communicate with your supervisor<br>communicate with your supervisor set<br>goals if you're struggling to meet those<br>goals communicate with your supervisor<br>um so that they can adjust goals or we<br>could find ways to um make your<br>situation more amenable to to reaching<br>uh to reaching your goals and it won't<br>come as a surprise either will it yeah<br>and I was I was going to say that um a<br>research project can change as well so I<br>mean that happens and we deal with it<br>yeah okay nicely answered oh one more<br>question Okie do um our International<br>PhD students do they have the same<br>access to University resources and<br>Facilities as domestic students<br>definitely 100% yes they're an Tigo<br>student all right awesome<br>fantastic can we one more please one<br>more come on okay um and this is can PhD<br>students take distance and hybrid<br>options or study<br>parttime so distance um effectively no<br>so if if you are wanting to be offshore<br>uh and you're an international student<br>you will be charged international fees<br>so if you um if the research that you're<br>doing doesn't require you to be here um<br>and you don't want to be here and you're<br>happy to pay International level fees<br>which are similar to about roughly four<br>times the the fees um the domestic rate<br>um then that is okay as as long as you<br>supervisor is Happy um with that um<br>distance and and part-time are um harder<br>for the supervisor um to manage um<br>because you've got other aspects taking<br>up your time um International students<br>do need to be full-time while they're<br>writing up they could potentially be<br>part-time um for that last part um if<br>you are on a student visa and your<br>course is supposed to be on campus in<br>denen you can't then go to another part<br>of the country um because that would be<br>in breach of a student visa uh and the<br>other one<br>was was the other part of that time no<br>um hybrid um so our thesis is um you<br>don't do it by Publications we don't<br>have that option of of of PhD by<br>publication so the hybrid is is a term<br>that is used where it might be that<br>there are four let's say up to four<br>Publications that you've done but they<br>need to be cohesive they need to be they<br>can't just be one chapter two chapter<br>three chapter they need to be cohesive<br>so they're put together um in a way that<br>it runs as a as a thesis if that makes<br>sense fantastic thank you I also uh just<br>want to add one thing real quickly if<br>you're interested in doing research in<br>your in a different country or if you're<br>interested in any of these you know any<br>of these options just make sure that's<br>clear when you're when you're talking to<br>that potential supervisor because that<br>supervisor might have might already be<br>doing research in that country might<br>already have some funding available or<br>might know of funding available or<br>opportunities that are available so<br>again it's it's about a it's not as much<br>about getting the you know the PHD and<br>the and the and all of the details are<br>important but establishing that<br>communication um and making sure that<br>you and the supervisor are always on<br>that same page is really the really the<br>key<br>here fantastic so we're just about to<br>wrap it up up for today um thank you so<br>much for being with us for the hour and<br>I hope you found this incredibly<br>informative if you've got any further<br>questions from a students perspective of<br>um students who are currently studying<br>PhD at a Tagle we have a platform called<br>uniud where you can reach out to them<br>and ask some um further questions and I<br>hope you enjoyed today so um on behalf<br>of all of our<br>panelists and thank you um and any
