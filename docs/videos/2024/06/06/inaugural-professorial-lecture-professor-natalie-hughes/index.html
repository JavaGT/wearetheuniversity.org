occasion to celebrate the<br>promotion of Natalie Hughes to professor<br>at the University of<br>ATO these lectures are a highlight of my<br>week as I'm sure they are of many of<br>yours they're a wonderful opport Unity<br>for us to come together and listen to<br>our new professors talk about their<br>personal Journeys their research<br>platform and the impact of their<br>research on<br>others I'd like to welcome colleagues<br>students and friends from across the<br>university and Beyond including those<br>joining us tonight by live<br>stream I'd like to give a special<br>welcome to Natalie's children Andrew and<br>CLA who are here in person this evening<br>as well as Jane who's watching on the<br>live stream all the way from the<br>Netherlands where I believe it's about<br>7:30 in the morning so that's quite a<br>commitment I'd also like to thank<br>Natalie's mom June her sisters Tracy and<br>Rebecca and her uncle Terrence who are<br>also here in person this<br>evening it's not easy to become a<br>professor at the University of atago<br>in order to be promoted to that level<br>candidates need to show that they are<br>outstanding in each of three categories<br>teaching research and<br>service Natalie has clearly met all of<br>these<br>criteria it is an honor and a privilege<br>to congratulate her this evening for<br>that outstanding achievement and I hope<br>you'll join me tonight into<br>the<br>same Natalie is Deputy dean of the<br>School of Pharmacy and is pharmaceutic<br>pharmaceutical scientists with expertise<br>in drug delivery Med medicine<br>formulation and pharmaceutical<br>analysis her commitment to the<br>University of ataro is<br>longstanding and she is an inte integral<br>part of theago<br>farell she has a bachelor of Pharmacy<br>and also a PhD from the<br>University and while she worked for a<br>short time as a post-doctoral researcher<br>at the University of Kansas she returned<br>to ataro in<br>1997 and has been here ever since so<br>thank you for that<br>commitment Natalie's research includes<br>improving drug delivery for neonates new<br>treatments for Medical Health and Pain<br>and topical treatments for promoting<br>wood wound healing in<br>dentistry she works in multidisciplinary<br>teams to develop new healthc care<br>options and products for all new<br>zealanders tonight Natalie will reflect<br>on her academic career to tell us a<br>little bit about her own personal<br>journey and about the impact of her<br>medical research on the profession on<br>her teaching and most importantly from<br>my perspective at least on her<br>students but before Natalie does that<br>it's my pleasure to hand over to Carlo<br>Mara uh to forly introduce Professor<br>Hughes and give you a little more detail<br>about her academic background tenot<br>C Koto cor carara taka I am carara I'm<br>the dean of the school of Pharmacy and<br>pharmaceutical Sciences um which Natalie<br>is an integral part of um as you all<br>know uh friends F colleagues and<br>students Natalie's a very unique<br>individual um and her role within the<br>School of Pharmacy has been such so<br>Natalie as as alluded to has been at the<br>School of Pharmacy when you consider in<br>almost every conceivable role that you<br>can think of so she did her<br>undergraduate there she did uh her<br>post-graduate training there um she's<br>been every single academic position um<br>from uh research fellow uh all the way<br>through now to Professor so she has this<br>really strong rooted commitment to the<br>School of Pharmacy and has seen all the<br>changes and all the developments that<br>have happened over time so she's very<br>unique in that regard I think she's the<br>she's either the second or the first<br>longest standing member of the School of<br>Pharmacy here at the University of Vago<br>um the last one is sort of standing from<br>the some of the original cohorts um and<br>it's been my absolute pleasure to work<br>with Natalie very closely over the last<br>eight years um she has uh been my Deputy<br>Dean although she's not currently the<br>deputy Dean right now but she's<br>fulfilled a number of roles including uh<br>being the dean of the undergraduate<br>programs which we have two of in the<br>School of Pharmacy right now and Natalie<br>has been very um integral in the<br>formation of our second degree program<br>The Bachelor of pharmaceutical Sciences<br>which I'm sure she will talk about um<br>Natalie was one of the first people that<br>I met actually when I came to New<br>Zealand um she took me grocery shopping<br>when I when I got here even though she<br>was not super chuff that I got the dean<br>job at the time she's told me<br>subsequently that I was not her favorite<br>person at that moment but we've<br>developed a very close friendship over<br>there over time she's forgiving me for<br>that um so you can understand that her<br>presentation is going to be amazing she<br>since she's had 30 years of BU building<br>his story and so I can't wait to hear<br>this story so I'm going to turn the mic<br>over to Professor Hughes or you have<br>your own mic and we'll take it from<br>there but I'm really looking forward to<br>Teno welcome everyone uh thank you<br>Professor Brock for your kind<br>introduction and for hosting my IPL<br>tonight um thank you Carlo for your<br>lovely introduction um you've been the<br>dean of the school um for the last what<br>eight years um and you've also been a<br>friend so I really appreciate that and<br>it's lovely to have you introduce me<br>tonight um thank you also for welcoming<br>my close family um as said um Jane is<br>watching in the Netherlands and two of<br>my children are here with their close<br>welcome I also see um that there's some<br>PhD graduates of mine here tonight and<br>I'm very privileged to see you here uh<br>you will see some of your work showcased<br>with uh another important guest here<br>tonight is my good friend professor<br>Julia Kennedy thank you for traveling to<br>be here with me tonight and thank you<br>gown uh today I want to um talk in my<br>IPL my um inaugural professorial lecture<br>a little bit about what I did in<br>Pharmacy um as Professor Mara has said<br>I've spent a lot of my time here at the<br>University of<br>atago uh and I chose to do that and I do<br>like um denen and<br>otago I've done uh research in pharmacy<br>and in formulation and that's what I<br>want to talk about today but also what's<br>important to me is the collaborations<br>that I have been involved with um in the<br>connections with people through research<br>so um you'll see some of that<br>tonight firstly what is um drug delivery<br>and why is this important and also um<br>I'll refer back to my title about<br>molecules to<br>medicines so um drugs are molecules<br>people discover them they have activity<br>they do good things for People's Health<br>but in their roest form they are white<br>powders we can't give a white powder<br>like this to a patient the dose is<br>uncontrolled<br>um we don't know how much they're going<br>to get uh it's very uncontrolled so what<br>has to happen is that powder that drug<br>substance has to be converted into some<br>sort of medicine a dosage form and you<br>can see on this um slide here um tablets<br>capsules and very common dosage forms<br>maybe Solutions uh of drugs for<br>injection as well but there are many<br>there are many different Dage forms<br>available and you probably know them<br>have seen them maybe some of you used<br>them now and when one thinks of um drug<br>delery a little bit uh more there's no<br>point in just having a medicine it's got<br>to be given to a person so um drug<br>delivery involves making that medicine<br>and then optimizing the diage and the<br>Dage rual in the um patient now patients<br>are not always humans for human medicine<br>um Animal Health there's a lot of<br>pharmaceutical products used in Animal<br>Health as well um so patients can be<br>people but they can also be um uh<br>so lots and lots of molecules are<br>discovered um but only a few make it<br>through to through the drug Discovery<br>pipeline to become medicines so why why<br>is it a problem why do some molecules<br>fail to become medicines I've got up<br>here two um two reasons why uh this<br>might happen uh and formulation<br>scientists deal with these a lot<br>uh on this side here I talk about<br>permeability and on this side aquous<br>solubility so some drugs are quite<br>soluble and they pass across biological<br>membranes quite<br>easily now I'm not going to say they're<br>easy to turn into medines but they're<br>not as hard as some other uh potential<br>molecules that are discovered for drag<br>uh for use as<br>meds um there are poorly water soluble<br>drugs these are the ones that<br>formulation scientists need to work on<br>uh and try to create strategies to help<br>these molecules dissolve so that they<br>can get into the body and then into the<br>blood and then find their way um to<br>their side of<br>action the other category um of U<br>medicines or or sorry of chemicals drugs<br>are highly water soluble ones so these<br>might be easy to make into solutions<br>they might be easy to make into<br>medicines but if they're poorly<br>permeable then they can't pass any<br>biological membranes to get into the<br>body so this is drugs like insulin they<br>can dissolve we can't take that orally<br>we can't have tablets of insulin because<br>membranes uh when a uh chemical or a<br>compound is formulated as a<br>medicine uh a dose can be given to a<br>patient this dose creates some sort of<br>concentration in the body and that has<br>some effect on cells<br>tissues uh and ultimately on someone's<br>health for example it might be a blood<br>pressure lowering drug so you take the<br>medication um it produces some<br>concentration in the body and that<br>concentration has some effect on blood<br>pressure now if it doesn't have the<br>right effect on blood pressure what do<br>you<br>do change the<br>dose so the dose can go up and down and<br>be adjusted to an<br>individual uh and when you change the<br>dose it changes the concentration which<br>changes the effect the drugs have good<br>and bad effects so they have positive<br>therapeutic effects but they also have<br>negative adverse effects so it's a<br>balance between those two and dose and<br>dosage form can sometimes have a role in<br>getting the optimal outcomes uh for<br>patient<br>Health uh so my um drug delivery<br>research kind of fits into two uh<br>categories I first look at developing<br>new Dage forms for bioactive<br>molecules uh and then also look to<br>getting the best out of medications that<br>already<br>exist now a little bit about<br>me um I've looked back on my<br>education um and I've known that I've<br>always had an interest in science and<br>maths from pretty early<br>schools started at lower Hut went to two<br>primary schools one intermediate and one<br>high<br>school um interestingly when I put this<br>together um I looked at these schools<br>and I went I spent the most time at D<br>Street school so I've reconnected with<br>that school and I'm talking with their<br>students tomorrow about science math and<br>technology so um it's been a positive<br>thing uh looking through U my background<br>for today's talk today's lecture my<br>family then moved to ockland<br>uh so I went um to school in Oakland for<br>two years uh they then moved to denan<br>and I went to school here for one year<br>at Maro College which doesn't exist<br>anymore it's um changed a couple of<br>times and now it's um Trinity<br>College um and it was when I was in<br>denen that I decided I wanted to go to<br>university I wanted to do something that<br>had maths and science but I wanted a<br>profession so Pharmacy was was pretty<br>obvious choice for me uh my dad also<br>helped me with that choice because at<br>the end of it I could have had a<br>pharmacy business and I think he quite<br>liked the idea of<br>that so there were two options for<br>studying pharmacy at the time the<br>University of atigo or the central<br>Institute of Technology in Upper Hut and<br>that wasn't far from where I grew up but<br>I liked denen and obviously I like Den<br>because I've stayed here um and I like<br>What U it has to offer so I chose<br>aago there wasn't a Health Sciences<br>first year then but there were similar<br>papers similar subjects and I actually<br>enrolled as a pharmacy intermediate<br>student so I knew I was doing pharmacy<br>from day one when I came to<br>University um however remembering that I<br>like maths I opted to take an extra<br>calculus paper uh and I enjoyed<br>that Pharmacy was another 3 years of<br>study um it was uh predominantly a<br>science based course back then and we<br>had a small class so I was one of 25 in<br>my class um I'm still good friends with<br>most of those 25 um there was another<br>CIT also um educated pharmacist so there<br>were more students um more pharmacist<br>trained there and there was a small<br>group trained in<br>aago so after I graduated I became an<br>intern pharmacist that's the first step<br>and I worked at Den<br>Hospital uh I'd work there in my summer<br>holidays and I was very happy to stay in<br>Denon one of my summer holidays actually<br>I worked at ockland hospital and Julia<br>kenned was my supervisor and I did a<br>summer studentship with her so I've had<br>a long um long connection with<br>Julia pharmacy at this time was located<br>in the basement of the hospital there<br>were long corridors there was a row of<br>Windows that you had to look up through<br>to see the<br>street um but while I was there Pharmacy<br>moved from this location to its current<br>site in the hospital and this reflected<br>um the change in Pharmacy and and uh<br>Pharmacy practice becoming more visible<br>uh and taking up more roles in<br>healthcare so I worked in SP and<br>Cardiology WS most and it was then I<br>decided I wanted to do a<br>PhD um dry powder inhalers were a new<br>thing for Asma quite common place now<br>but they were new back then I liked<br>compounding<br>medicines uh I like making parental<br>nutritions so I was interested in doing<br>technology uh so it was only a short<br>walk across the road from the hospital<br>to the pharmacy uh school and I talked<br>to the one academic at the time who<br>could supervise such a project and this<br>was David Jones so his picture is<br>there David he was an academic from<br>Queens University Belfast in Northern<br>Island had um recently started atago was<br>his first academic job after graduating<br>with his PhD uh he's now the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for education and students at<br>uh Queens<br>University um I started my research with<br>him he had a few project ideas I picked<br>one um this one here right delivery of<br>CLW hix Peri for periodontal<br>diseases he introduced me to Doug HRA<br>um who was a periodontist at the dental<br>school at the time and I learned about<br>these things called periodontal diseases<br>they're gum<br>diseases uh they're caused by um uh<br>bacteria and they're an inflammatory<br>condition and what I learned at that<br>those early meetings was that clinicians<br>wanted better treatments and I think<br>that's a common story that goes through<br>um most of the work I've done so I got<br>started as a master student and then<br>upgraded to a PhD I taught lectures in<br>labs and pharmaceutics right from the<br>beginning so there was me and one other<br>student sea McBride's Stewart who helped<br>David with the teaching in uh<br>pharmaceutics and Drug delivery and<br>actually what I found the quickest way<br>to learn something is to teach it<br>stuff the other person in the slide is<br>Professor an<br>Tucker um David left during my PhD to<br>return to Northern irland<br>to a job in the pharmaceutical industry<br>and then taka had recently arrived at<br>aaro from Australia to take up a newly<br>created cheer and pharmaceutical<br>Sciences he became my PhD<br>supervisor he liked statistics and I<br>sort of started to learn a bit more<br>about statistics and I've kind of<br>carried that on throughout my career and<br>I now have a BC in statistics so I did<br>that for parttime while I was working uh<br>over a few years and graduated with that<br>and<br>2022 um David has uh was my supervisor<br>and he kept an interest in the project<br>from a distance and he's been really an<br>important academic Mentor for me<br>career and it was at this time when I<br>started my PhD I had to think in depth<br>about what makes up a medicine as I said<br>before you've got a drug a bioactive<br>molecule can't be given directly to a<br>patient<br>needs to be turned into a dosage form<br>dosage forms contain the active and all<br>other<br>components uh we call them excipients<br>and they control the drug release from<br>the dosage<br>form sometimes the drug needs to be<br>released quickly to have a rapid effect<br>and other times it's better if it comes<br>out more slowly and you have a slow um<br>release and a constant level of drug in<br>the<br>body so drug<br>um Sciences uh help you to design<br>materials that will achieve all of these<br>types of Rel Pro<br>fox in periodontal disease um there are<br>affected SES in the mouth and these can<br>be treated so periodontists treat these<br>sites but the problem that was um uh<br>talked about at the time or I became<br>aware of at the time was they could be<br>treated there was a little Gap or little<br>pocket between the tooth root and the<br>support structures that surround it um<br>once it was treated that space or pocket<br>still stays there it still exists so it<br>continues so what was my solution to<br>create some sort of simple device I say<br>simple because it needs to be able to be<br>manufactured that could be attached to<br>the tooth surface just at the opening of<br>the period onum<br>pocket so if the pocket was treated<br>bacteria taken out maybe we could create<br>this little Zone um of plaque free zone<br>with there's no microorganisms and then<br>recolonization um so I say simple device<br>but I did spend a lot of time uh<br>creating that simple device um we made<br>draging<br>films um these were made of of a<br>biodegradable polymer they had a<br>antiseptic um drug or an antibacterial<br>drug in them uh and I measured the<br>release rate in vitro so in little<br>um little test<br>tubes I met a range of these and then I<br>was going to do a clinical trial so I<br>had to make some calculations and figure<br>out what release rate I needed from my<br>little pieces of film to actually treat<br>um the site and give a nice<br>antibacterial concentration in the<br>saliva film around and I had one shot at<br>it because I could only do one clinical<br>trials um my calculations I think were<br>good because it did seem to<br>work uh these are um uh the tooth bonded<br>fils do you see my arrow no you don't<br>see my arrow okay<br>um you can see the sorry the the film<br>sit sitting on the tooth uh and when I<br>measured the CLX concentrations I made<br>this little essay that that could uh<br>sample very tiny volumes of saliva film<br>and measure chlorexidine there were<br>antia concentrations right around the<br>device but a tooth away they were low so<br>clorine doesn't taste very nice so you<br>don't really want a mouthful of clodine<br>um for days on end because it doesn't<br>nice and having done all of my education<br>in New Zealand it was now time to move<br>overseas um I got a post St at the<br>University of Kansas and we had plans uh<br>to move with our one-year-old daughter<br>to the<br>US um in this slide here you can see<br>that I did my PhD my postto and then I<br>came back for PhD graduation that's not<br>normal you usually graduate before you<br>do<br>postart um but I didn't I like<br>graduation<br>ceremonies uh I didn't want to miss out<br>on it um I like for my family to to come<br>as well and actually in the last 20<br>years I've been to virtually every<br>Pharmacy student graduation um that<br>we've had so I do like graduation so I<br>was going to miss my own the other um<br>thing that was important to me is my<br>mother-in-law was the chancellor of the<br>University at the time and I really<br>wanted her to confirm my degree so I did<br>wait and I did get my degree when I came<br>back uh and we made it to the front page<br>of the<br>ODT um and I kept it obviously because<br>it's here uh and actually um it was a<br>great family event um and I think Jane<br>my oldest um child stole the show in<br>that um photo with her beautiful hat<br>with the flowers that were put on by my<br>sister<br>Tracy so in my postto um was in the<br>University of Kansas I worked uh for<br>Professor valve Stellar he was a<br>renowned pharmaceutical scientist was<br>quite daunting guy to a lab like this<br>after being in New<br>Zealand um but I did okay um I found the<br>skills I had from atago were good they<br>were transferable and I could work well<br>in this in the<br>lab um and it was here that I learned<br>the basics of<br>commercialization um and the advice was<br>look for gaps and therapies areas where<br>treatments are needed or the treatments<br>that exist in not that good and work on<br>these um while doing that I keep good<br>records of your research because you<br>might need them in patent disputes later<br>on and he was well aware of that and<br>this was the case because I did work on<br>a project that had a patent dispute and<br>something like 10 years later um I was<br>contacted rang up and said oh can you um<br>tell us about what you did 10 years ago<br>and they showed me pictures of my<br>labbook and oh yeah know what I did cuz<br>I learned how to write really good lab<br>um information in my books and the date<br>set the uh the date for discovery of of<br>the invention that went on to be a<br>product so I try to tell my students<br>that that's a really important thing to<br>do oops at Kansas I had two roles um so<br>I was doing preformulation work for<br>novel compounds that had potential and<br>cancer activity um uh vs group was<br>contracted by the National Cancer<br>Institute there were two post dos<br>working on this when I was<br>there and this involved things like<br>stability solubility work uh and trying<br>to get the compounds into a form that<br>they could be uh investiga further<br>potentially turned into medicines and I<br>was lucky again here because I worked on<br>seven compounds did the introductory<br>work so you know not the the um creative<br>inventive work at the stage but one of<br>them became a um a marketed drug it's<br>called btis and it's used to treat<br>multiple Myoma so I got the first lot of<br>this in a little little envelope little<br>bit of drag to try and do stability um<br>and solubility work<br>on the other thing uh I worked on was um<br>uh cyclodextrin which were a new<br>excipient they were used to enhance<br>solubility because they were a circular<br>compound that were made of sugars and<br>they made a ring uh they had a<br>hydrophobic interior and a hydrophilic<br>exterior so a hydrophobic drug could sit<br>in this inside that molecule and then<br>the whole complex is soluble so it<br>increases solubility uh we also thought<br>it would increase um uh would sorry<br>decrease urgency of urgent drugs right<br>because the same principle an urgent<br>drug is inside the cavity and then that<br>whole complex is um is non- irritant so<br>that was another part of my<br>posttop and I enjoyed that and published<br>area so being in the middle of the<br>US was um we were far away from<br>mountains in the coast is very unlike<br>New<br>Zealand um so we bought an iconic<br>American Car family car and we went on<br>lots of road trips through the Midwest<br>uh you can see the the big skies and the<br>straight roads we definitely tried to<br>get off the main roads and into some of<br>the minor roads and it was really a lot<br>of fun and of course<br>um being in Kansas we did go to The<br>Wizard of<br>Oz uh this was in a little town in<br>Western Kansas and they had all of the<br>props from the movies there was really<br>fun after my postt we came back to New<br>Zealand uh and the Jeep came too so<br>we've had some family holidays um in the<br>Jeep uh around central<br>Oto and I worked parttime for a while we<br>settled back into New Zealand then I got<br>my job as lectur then you know just kept<br>going from that point but the good thing<br>about becoming a lecturer is I could<br>supervise PhD students and I could have<br>PhD projects so that's what I wanted to<br>do the first of these was um uh use the<br>same cycle addiction solubilizing<br>technology that I had learned about in<br>the US but applied it to an animal<br>health product so Zim wo did this work<br>uh and she combined a more traditional<br>solubilization technique with the added<br>cycl EX<br>and got um an injectable form of an anti<br>helic<br>drug and when this was given to sheep<br>which were the the target um uh species<br>for the product um she showed while<br>measuring blood levels that uh you got<br>an increase in both the um the drug<br>itself and uh its<br>metabolite um so we were able to improve<br>its solubility increase plasma con<br>concentrations after a single injection<br>and it was less irritant so had lots of<br>advantages as a graduated um in 2006 and<br>now she's a professor at the School of<br>Pharmacy um at ockland University it's<br>nice to see her doing<br>well biologic drugs were becoming quite<br>um important at this stage um they're<br>reasonably common now still expensive<br>though they're all the Mad type drugs<br>right<br>um they proteins they're different to<br>small molecules so you needed different<br>strategies to turn these into medicines<br>so I developed an interest in these and<br>supervised five PhD students in this<br>area some did fundamental work so around<br>um uh stability turning the um creating<br>dosage forms and some looked for um more<br>applied topics and we look we're looking<br>at um delivery of growth factors to<br>wounds and that's what we see in the<br>slide um we were able to make uh some<br>devices we were able to apply them to<br>wounds and we were able to see that the<br>growth factor was retained in the in<br>that wound environment and hopefully had<br>some benefit on wound healing also<br>developed a little bit of an interest in<br>math modeling so that sort of fitted in<br>with my stats and math degree that I was<br>pursuing at the time and had a PhD<br>student uh create a mathematical model<br>environment School of Pharmacy was quite<br>active in an organization called the<br>controlled Release Society it's an<br>international group of academics and<br>Industrial scientists um interested in<br>drug delivery and at one conference uh<br>we decided to well some people some of<br>us decided at this this um conference to<br>um have a workshop back in New<br>um so we did and this was based on<br>protein drug delivery protein were new<br>at the time novel at the time uh<br>students wanted to learn about them so<br>we could bring experts from um<br>International experts back to New<br>Zealand and they could uh interact with<br>our students in small groups a lot<br>better for the students than trying to<br>send them out to the international sites<br>where there's lots of people to compete<br>for the attention of these people we<br>brought the experts here to New Zealand<br>and they were able to benefit from that<br>um and it's um a really good initiative<br>today my next big shift was to move to<br>more clinically focused projects so I<br>became the head of clinical pharmacy at<br>the school and I was encouraged in this<br>uh role by my good friend and clinical<br>colleague Professor Julia<br>Kennedy and she introduced me to uh<br>David reath a pediatrician and clinical<br>pharmacologist and Matthew Zacharias an<br>anst and I was invited to start working<br>pain why could I do that because I could<br>measure things quite a good analyst I<br>enjoy making<br>essays um I can develop essays that will<br>look at the Active so this is<br>paracetamol in this case but all of its<br>metabolites as well so when you normally<br>take um par<br>cetamol um it gets absorbed into the<br>body in the liver it's metabolized to<br>two uh different compounds you can see<br>there A glucoronide and A<br>sulfate uh and that's the normal<br>metabolic pathway for paracetamol at<br>normal doses as doses increase there's a<br>third metabolic pathway that um becomes<br>apparent it's there with small doses but<br>um at higher doses it becomes more<br>apparent um this produces a um a very<br>reactive intermediate compound can't<br>show this one here but this this one<br>there just on the left called<br>nqu um it also can be um metabolized<br>further and and detoxified the form cine<br>and captur but if it builds up then it<br>this is the compound that binds to um<br>proteins in the liver and causes the<br>significant toxicity of paracetamol and<br>higher doses in over so I could develop<br>essays that could measure all of these<br>them the trial that we um that I was<br>invited to work on because I could do<br>this analysis um was looking at the<br>safety of two high dose regimens of<br>paracetamol and healthy adults single<br>dose study um the<br>dose uh as the dose<br>increased the plasma concentrations were<br>seen to increase in proportion to the<br>dose so the the red curve is the higher<br>dose and the blue curve is the lower<br>dose um but when there were the clinical<br>effects of these two does were examined<br>the higher dose was no better than the<br>lower dose so there was no need to go<br>that high and there were some signs that<br>there was um some toxicity with that<br>higher dice or some adverse effects<br>apparent this work extended a bit<br>further into a PhD<br>project um and this PhD was um was by<br>Katie Owens Katie's here<br>tonight uh and interestingly um there<br>was another student another New Zealand<br>graduate from here uh working in Cork<br>with Julia Kennedy and he was doing a<br>similar type of study and that was<br>Philip Murphy he was a graduate of aago<br>um pharmacy school and they combined<br>their data sets and produced a paper<br>together on the effects of um major<br>surgery on paracetamol metabolism and we<br>can see the left and the right curves<br>different because there is a difference<br>before and after surgery so it's<br>important to know these things when<br>drugs are used in people um in different<br>groups of people they may achieve<br>different concentrations and therefore<br>have different effects and we might need<br>going to move topics a little bit here<br>drug delivery um pres present some<br>challenges in young very young patients<br>this is the work of N and nanat that was<br>talked about<br>before a number of students have been<br>involved in this work which started with<br>Katherine sherin's PhD she recognized<br>that slow infusions were very slow in<br>little babies were slower than expected<br>and gentle is a drug that you need to<br>have a a high peak concentration for it<br>to be effective so this extended<br>duration of delivery um was probably not<br>allowing the best to be got out of that<br>gent uh<br>Administration uh so I again could<br>measure gend meon so there's an essay<br>lots of essays with um pinks the Peaks<br>uh are proportional to the concentration<br>in the<br>sum uh we set up infusions in our lab<br>and we could test a lot of<br>variables um on their fusion and see how<br>fast the drug came through the line and<br>surprisingly um well not surprisingly<br>took a long time for the drug to get<br>through the line when it was moving very<br>slowly and the solution was not to give<br>slow infusions but to give a fast bolus<br>into the line and let the Slow line take<br>it into the so we um<br>so there was a change in the way that<br>Genty was given uh in the Nik w at Denon<br>and that slide um just at the bottom<br>here uh shows Peak concentrations when<br>the drug was given really slowly on the<br>uh left and on the right when the drug<br>was um put quickly into the line that<br>those dots are all a lot closer together<br>because the Pak concentrations were much<br>so um there've been several other<br>projects in<br>neonates um especially preum neonates<br>this these small patients have some<br>unique health issues um and two of these<br>are shown here so Emma Salis on the<br>right investigated a condition called<br>neonatal hypoglycemia so when a Nate<br>born um early so pre-term their pancreas<br>is not well developed so they don't<br>produce uh insulin as well as an older<br>return baby um and experience<br>hypoglycemia to its high blood glucose<br>and they need to be treated with<br>insulin uh so Emma's um PhD looked at<br>trying to understand um this um<br>hypoglycemia in neonates and she used a<br>marker for the babies's natural<br>production of insulin C peptide this is<br>a piece of um the Protein that's cleaved<br>off insulin after it's um as it's<br>secreted from the<br>pancreas and if you measure circulating<br>levels of C peptide then you know um<br>whether the insulin comes from the baby<br>or it's from the infusion um that<br>glucose the other project is um Lisa<br>krer she's a neonatal pharmacist<br>um and she knew of this um problem of<br>um retinopathy of prematurity because<br>she was an inal<br>pharmacist um the treatment at the time<br>was that the the eyes had to be examined<br>by an<br>opthalmologist um so the babies needed<br>to have some um medication uh given to<br>the put in the eyes and stilled in the<br>eyes to open up the pupil so the<br>opthalmologist could see the back of the<br>eye<br>um but there aren't ey drops for babies<br>there eye drops for adults so large<br>drops were being given to babies and<br>they were flooding the eye and maybe<br>causing some adverse effects so L's<br>project was looking at could we use<br>little drops for little eyes and she's<br>eyes um moving back to adults again<br>where there's a clinical need back to<br>Dentistry um on the left side of this um<br>slide is Sarah Hennings PhD she was<br>looking at novel materials that could be<br>used as saliva substitutes in people<br>with xerostomia xerostomia is a<br>condition where you don't have saliva<br>produced so it's um patients have very<br>dry mouth people have very dry mouth if<br>they have xerostomia and they need to<br>replace that saliva with something so<br>her project looked at what we could<br>replace it with can we replace it with<br>something better um then it's currently<br>available and she developed these uh<br>frequency<br>dependent um visco elastic<br>materials uh as saliva<br>substitutes um they are really<br>interesting a um I guess a mouthful<br>there to to describe those but these<br>materials when you're not speaking and<br>your mouth's at rest they sit on the<br>mosal surface so they just sit in the<br>mouth when you speak and talk they begin<br>to<br>right is a bigger project it's back<br>going back to periodontal disas where I<br>started um and I'm working in a group um<br>with um associate professor dor coats um<br>War Duncan two postdocs and two PhD<br>students and again now we're looking at<br>um treatments for actively treating<br>inside the pocket uh and using some<br>natural products so we know Manuka Honey<br>is good for wound healing but honey near<br>teeth is probably not a good idea CU<br>it's got sugar but other products for<br>from Manuka that have antimicrobial<br>activity could be valuable and again I'm<br>looking at maybe doing some modeling of<br>this um area here to see what's an<br>optimal release rate from our um<br>particles<br>so having a background in um drug<br>delivery analytical methods and a<br>pharmacy background meant I've been<br>asked and I have contributed to a lot of<br>different projects and this uh so I<br>don't miss out any of the PhD students<br>and any of the projects that I'm<br>involved with I have a slide of um lots<br>of projects here the first two around um<br>uh anti-coagulant drugs so with<br>these thin the blood stop the blood<br>clotting but dose is important because<br>if you give too much the adverse effect<br>might be bleeding if you don't give<br>enough then the patient has risk or<br>person has risk of clots forming so<br>there's a really nice really narrow<br>balance in dosing for these um these<br>agents uh Lucy is looking at information<br>given to um people about their medicines<br>and hear about drugs used in mental<br>health for pregnant women so they can<br>make good decisions about or inform<br>decisions about whether to continue or<br>change<br>medications paracetamol um story<br>continues uh with Jan sales's PhD and<br>she's looking at pharmacokinetics and<br>how that changes if children have<br>fever uh this one<br>here uh fact and fiction communic<br>science through crime fiction um I'm not<br>100% sure how I got involved in that<br>project but I did yeah the um initial<br>project this was for Vander Simon's PhD<br>um there was a poison uh in the crime<br>fiction uh novel um and I did want to<br>learn something about science<br>communication so I agreed to be um a<br>supervisor in this<br>project and I said about patients not<br>always being humans sometimes animals<br>arene mcdal is has a really good<br>interest and experience in um Wildlife<br>dosing wildlife and medicines for<br>wildlife uh I'm hoping to help with some<br>analysis of some of those um samples so<br>we can see how um species like penguins<br>metabolized<br>drugs I talked about<br>commercialization right at the beginning<br>I learned about this um when I was in<br>Kansas and when I came back I was always<br>looking for an opportunity U to be able<br>to do this and I Lily found one um with<br>this project um so all drug delivery<br>scientists want to work on projects that<br>eventually become<br>medicines uh ketamine is an old drug<br>that's finding New Uses in mental health<br>and I learned about this um when I met<br>um Professor Paul glue and again who's<br>looking for someone to measure some<br>samples so I get invited to a number of<br>projects through that<br>Avenue um had done some uh done a lot of<br>work on ketamine and treatment resistant<br>depression uh when I joined uh we're<br>looking at whether ketamin also had<br>beneficial effects in<br>anxiety and in one of these studies we<br>did take blood samples from our<br>participants develop an<br>essay uh and measure the<br>pharmacokinetics of uh ketamine and its<br>ketamine all these um uh studies were<br>done with injectable ketamine is that<br>the best drug delivery solution for<br>ketamine probably not injections not not<br>very convenient for<br>patients<br>um so Paul asked me if I could make<br>tablets and I said yes I know how to<br>make tablets but I can't do them and the<br>quality that you need I can't make<br>quality or the scale that you need we<br>need an industrial partner uh and I had<br>um some industrial contacts through<br>Pharmacy and Drug delivery and we um met<br>with um Peter Surman from Douglas<br>pharmaceutical at a when he was down for<br>a conference in denen we had a nice<br>meeting he liked the idea we all went up<br>we then joined with Alex tickle and we<br>all Jo went up to um Oakland to pitched<br>this idea at Douglas um and they seemed<br>to like the idea and pursued the project<br>and we've had a really good<br>collaboration with Douglas<br>Pharmaceuticals and they have made an<br>oral ketamine um dosage form these are<br>tablets there's are controlled release<br>they released slowly over 12<br>hours um when given to healthy<br>volunteers um we can we measured um<br>plasma concentrations of ketamine in the<br>active<br>uh sorry ketamine and its active<br>metabolite nor ketamine and because<br>ketamine is given when given orally gets<br>absorbed and passes through the liver<br>the liver metabolizes it and actually<br>what we see in these graphs uh is that<br>the the higher um curves are actually<br>the metabolite nor<br>ketamine so we have lower levels of<br>ketamine and maybe that helps the<br>tolerability um of this medication uh in<br>patients<br>phase two Studies have been<br>completed by um Douglas<br>Pharmaceuticals um and if we think about<br>what the drug delivery pipeline looks<br>like it's very long prediscovery um<br>there's some pre-clinical work the<br>clinical trials of phase 1 2 3 and then<br>there's um a review and Regulatory<br>approval so it is a long process um so<br>with uh this product um control release<br>k is finished at phase two so it's<br>getting there and it's looking promising<br>uh from those press releases which is<br>really exciting so we continue to do<br>some work in this area I'm making better<br>essays which is what I do um my previous<br>the previous essay was um able to uh<br>measure norketamine and ketamine we now<br>have a ability to measure a potentially<br>active third Metabo uh that took us a we<br>while and I think FZ is in the audience<br>essay uh work also continues to find out<br>if ketamine is helpful in other mental<br>health<br>conditions also on biomarkers for kin's<br>effect to know if it's working or not uh<br>and alongside these we will be measuring<br>plasma concentrations of ketamine<br>norketamine and hydroxy nor ketamine now<br>and see if these correlate with the<br>biomakers uh and the um clinical um<br>um I like to try and invent things um I<br>like the proof of concept uh uh rounds<br>that<br>oilo innovate Innovation um run I've<br>done been to a number of them pitching<br>ideas is quite fun have to say give your<br>idea quite a quick pitch to see if um<br>someone is interested in taking this<br>further we did win this at one year um<br>we had a an idea for pain relief<br>research um and we're working on it<br>come so I've done a lot of things in<br>drug delivery I thought I'd just sum up<br>by saying what do I know now I know<br>neonatal infusion lines are different to<br>those in adults I know little eyes need<br>little drops I know pharmacokinetic<br>analyses linked with clinical uh<br>measurement of clinical effects can help<br>guide dosing in different patient<br>groups I know gum diseases need local<br>treatments we all need saliva and we<br>need better um improved saliva<br>substitutes the lower Peak<br>concentrations and sustained levels of<br>ketamine seem to help its tolerability<br>as a therapeutic<br>agent I didn't talk too much about an<br>animis but um an is bind differently to<br>receptors uh and that possibly modifies<br>their effects and can have<br>advantages protein bioactives needs<br>stabilization in drug Delivery Systems<br>drug solubility and stability key<br>ingredients to medicines being<br>developable uh learning about PK and<br>Wildlife could help support their dosing<br>um<br>decisions commercialization a really<br>long<br>game uh and crime infections better if<br>correctly um so I really um I've talked<br>or skimmed through gone through quickly<br>PhD projects um and I'd like to<br>acknowledge the PhD students who do that<br>work um I've enjoyed working with you I<br>love seeing what you do after your PhD<br>it's very rewarding part of the<br>job so thank<br>you I've worked with many other students<br>as well so of students through the lab<br>on various<br>projects um and a group of students uh<br>from the University of b used to come<br>here for elective elective projects it's<br>quite a big group of students now it's<br>nice to see what they're doing as well<br>uh we also have um a number of students<br>from Copenhagen doing Masters here uh at<br>collaboration I want to acknowledge<br>collaborators um Within New Zealand and<br>the pharmacy school work with a lot of<br>people I've been here a long time I've<br>worked with just about<br>everybody um and I've worked with a lot<br>of people at the University of tago but<br>also um internationally New Zealand is<br>quite a long way away from the rest of<br>the world so we do have to travel and<br>I'm grateful for the patience of my<br>children that who put up with my<br>travel um you do have to travel and you<br>do have to make connections to be able<br>I want to acknowledge research funding<br>of course we can't do research without<br>funding um and especially the<br>pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand<br>who started me off with a PhD<br>scholarship and allowed me to um have<br>this<br>career need to acknowledge study<br>participants in their funno because<br>without their active and generous<br>participation we wouldn't have anything<br>staff and students of the School of<br>Pharmacy there are many over the years<br>I've been there and I probably have been<br>K and I kind of want to end with this<br>because as associate Dean for<br>undergraduate programs I've done this<br>role on and off for for probably 15<br>years and I've been at the School of<br>Pharmacy for 23 years as an academic<br>there's an amazing amount of work that<br>goes on in curriculum<br>development um the program that I had<br>many years ago is very different to what<br>we have now we still have a really<br>strong science base and we work hard to<br>make sure that<br>stays um but we prepare our graduates to<br>be key members of the healthcare team so<br>they have a lot more clinical a lot more<br>education we introduced uh as was said<br>at the in at the beginning a<br>degree called The Bachelor of<br>pharmaceutical Sciences we're the only<br>University of New Zealand to offer this<br>degree and we educate students through<br>this degree for the um pharmaceutical<br>biotech and related<br>Industries um so my slide ago science<br>for pharmacists and scientists for<br>industry I think having these two<br>degrees collocated in School of Pharmacy<br>um allows us to gain strength as a<br>both lastly I acknowledge my family I'm<br>a close family the kids have grown up<br>alongside my academic<br>career um acknowledge my dad who was<br>encouraged me to go to Pharmacy he<br>didn't probably didn't think I wanted to<br>do this but um but that was great and my<br>sisters and I'm very pleased that they<br>were able to make it here today to hear<br>a little bit about what I've done and I<br>still like road trips i' got a road trip<br>me so C pie tafiti fire Kata C pie Tata<br>fola<br>everyone<br>thank you so much Professor Hughes that<br>was uh really enjoyable to see how far<br>you've come and in that one slide which<br>gives the whole range of activities that<br>you've done over your career is amazing<br>just the the breadth of things from<br>crime fiction all all the way from you<br>know doing Pho kinetics and Penguins so<br>that is that is quite thepan of research<br>um I think that is absolutely<br>fantastic um there's a small gift from<br>the<br>University I don't know if anybody wants<br>uh I'm just going to turn it over now to<br>Professor Megan Gibbons uh for some<br>brief<br>words ah K thank you um so I'm the pro<br>Vice Chancellor of Health Sciences and<br>it's my absolute pleasure to listen to<br>Natalie tonight um and hear her journey<br>and and where she's come and um where<br>she is now so congratulations um and I'm<br>I'm going to thank you all for joining<br>us tonight and welcome you to come and<br>join us at the staff club uh for<br>Refreshments now and celebrate Natalie's</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
