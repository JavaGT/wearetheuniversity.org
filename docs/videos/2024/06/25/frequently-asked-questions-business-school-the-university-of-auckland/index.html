marketing<br>at the University of ockland business<br>school hi I'm Daniel I study Commerce<br>and science conin at the University of<br>Oakland hi I'm dhei and I study a<br>Commerce and science conoid let's get<br>into some frequently asked<br>questions if you could instantly become<br>an expert in any subject what would it<br>be now I have given some thought to this<br>I am a hobbyist chef so I think uh<br>French cuisine specifically but most<br>certainly uh an expert uh Michelin star<br>level Chef why should you study business<br>great question business is all around us<br>it's in every company product and<br>service so you'll have ample opportunity<br>to use the skills you'll learn with an<br>organization or perhaps in your own<br>business think about the last thing you<br>bought a lot of people worked really<br>hard to make that happen at our business<br>school you'll learn how to handle real<br>world business situations you'll gain<br>practical skills and knowledge by<br>solving those problems with your<br>teachers and classmates you'll get to<br>see what it's like to turn an idea into<br>a business you'll also get to tackle big<br>challenges that businesses face today<br>like the future of work sustainable<br>practices and changing business models<br>particularly in a digital world you'll<br>also explore how businesses can be<br>sustainable and good for the environment<br>here at the University of ockland<br>business school we offer Innovative<br>undergraduate learning opportunities and<br>experiences that will give you the<br>skills and knowledge that employers want<br>you'll be in high demand in The Wider<br>Industries you serve why did you choose<br>to study business good question so a<br>little bit of background about me I went<br>to high school in the United States<br>before moving back to Oakland and rangit<br>Toto College specifically in my final<br>year of high school so this very early<br>experience overseas was what inspired an<br>interest in international business being<br>able to interact with other people and<br>cultures and the like uh was of great<br>interest to me so I wanted to extend<br>that into my studies and have<br>opportunity in business to work overseas<br>and perhaps uh do more of the same uh so<br>my initial experience or my initial<br>inspiration for studying business uh was<br>so that I could enjoy many more of those<br>experiences overseas in a business<br>context if you could only eat one food<br>for the rest of your life what would it<br>be okay I have actually thought about<br>this before it would definitely be<br>potato but hear me out cuz you can cook<br>potato in so many different ways you can<br>have fries crisps like mashed potato you<br>can make it healthy or non-healthy<br>potato is the most<br>versatile why did you choose to study<br>business at the University of Oakland so<br>um I went to ipsum Girls Grammar School<br>and that's where I was exposed to<br>economics and business studies and I was<br>also exposed to level three biology<br>which I really enjoyed and that's what<br>led me to selecting my majors and I<br>chose the University of Orland specific<br>speically because it's got a high<br>International reputation and I also live<br>in Oakland so it was the most convenient<br>for me so Oakland uni was an<br>no-brainer are you a cat or dog person<br>uh personally I'm a dog person because I<br>think that the cat's eyes are are Tad<br>scary when you look at them and also I<br>have a cat allergy so yeah why did you<br>choose to study business at the<br>University of Oakland so I went to West<br>Lake boys high school and I chose to<br>study business at the University of<br>ockland because it's the best business<br>school in the country but what really<br>reassured my opinion was when I went to<br>the open day and I just got this really<br>really positive and friendly vibe from<br>all the staff and the student<br>Representatives what is the first year<br>in business like at the University of<br>ockland in your first year of business<br>you get to try out different courses a<br>little bit of everything in fact before<br>deciding you're major you're most<br>certainly not locked into to a major in<br>your very first year if you're a<br>full-time student and The Bachelor of<br>Commerce or The Bachelor of property<br>you'll typically take eight es in a year<br>part-time students might do fewer<br>courses in a year students who study<br>conjoint programs which means they study<br>two bachelor's degrees at the same time<br>within a shorter time frame might do<br>more courses in a year but it's okay to<br>take more or less depending on your<br>situation and you may not have quite<br>decided what it is that you most enjoy<br>about business just yet there are core<br>courses that all bcom and B propop<br>students will take this is great because<br>all our undergraduate students get the<br>same foundational knowledge some of you<br>might already know what you want to<br>study and which career path you want to<br>go into and that's great but if you're<br>unsure about your path that's totally<br>okay too so use your first year to<br>explore and find out what you enjoy get<br>steeped perhaps in those uh in those<br>courses and the course work and those<br>interactions you can learn more about<br>courses on our website if you want more<br>information what is the firste common<br>core now this is business school<br>language so a very good question indeed<br>all first year Bachelor of Commerce and<br>Bachelor of property students will take<br>six Common Core courses these courses<br>give you a well-rounded view of business<br>so a little bit of everything the<br>business core is a unique feature of our<br>programs and forms the backbone of your<br>business degree these insights and<br>information can take you anywhere toward<br>different Majors the interdisciplinary<br>core is designed to prepare you for the<br>real world of business it extends your<br>understanding of how business fits<br>together it develops your applied skills<br>and complements specialist know from<br>your Majors that you may choose later on<br>the great thing about these core courses<br>is that they prepare you for any major<br>and you can check out our website to<br>learn more about these core courses and<br>how best You may wish to combine them<br>with your major courses later on what<br>support services are available at the<br>business school so there are plenty of<br>support services available at the<br>business school so from enrollment<br>support to academic tutorials related to<br>study skills office hours with lecturers<br>and so much more we also have a<br>dedicated business school career center<br>that offers one-on-one support and they<br>can help you chart out your career path<br>review your CV cover letter and Linkedin<br>The Learning Hub is also a great place<br>to get academic skills support at the<br>business school they have online support<br>for your learning and they can also help<br>you

it in<br>high school nope you don't need to have<br>study business in high school to do well<br>at your studies at business School our<br>six first year core courses give you<br>good foundational knowledge to help you<br>succeed in your bcom or Bop studies what<br>does Blended and flipped course design<br>and delivery mean well that's a bit of a<br>mouthful that sounds perhaps more like<br>culinary school than business school so<br>excellent question your first year will<br>be both active and interactive Blended<br>learning means having a mix of online<br>and in-person learning a flipped<br>classroom approach means students<br>prepare before they come to class ready<br>to dive deeper into the topics you'll<br>find all your pre-class work on canvas<br>which is the University's online<br>learning management system then you'll<br>join a 2-hour weekly Workshop where<br>we'll expand on what you've learned<br>you'll work in teams interact with<br>classmates and facilitators and your<br>lecturers and apply what you've learned<br>it's engaging interactive and fun what<br>can you major in at the business school<br>now you've probably heard this word<br>major before and it's really rather<br>simple a major is the main subject area<br>that you choose to study in your degree<br>our Bachelor of Commerce has 12 Majors<br>you can choose from I teach marketing so<br>it's obviously the most important but we<br>have a great many other topics available<br>that you can choose from as a major like<br>Innovation and Entrepreneurship business<br>analytics commercial law international<br>business and so on we have much much<br>more detail on our website that you can<br>check to find out the finer points of<br>how these combine with each other and<br>what you might be expected to learn when<br>do you need to choose your Maj Don't<br>Panic is the key message here great news<br>you have time before you need to decide<br>on your Bachelor of Commerce Majors you<br>can be involved in your coursework and<br>interactions with your teammates and<br>lecturers and the like before you have<br>to make any decision on your Majors<br>explore what interests and inspires you<br>the common set of core courses that you<br>will take will provide that platform of<br>skills and knowledge for all possible<br>Majors so you can decide once you've had<br>opportunity to complete those courses at<br>the start of your second year you'll<br>need to make a final decision on which<br>majors you'd like to take how many<br>majors can you take it's entirely up to<br>you depending on your interest or<br>ambition in the bcom you can take a<br>single major or a double major most of<br>our single degree bcom students take a<br>double major double Majors give you the<br>chance to pair different interests<br>increasing your knowledge and career<br>options and giving you a mixed bag of<br>instruments and insights to carry into<br>practice however some of our students do<br>decide to take a single major within the<br>bcom if they have a real particular<br>interest in a specific discipline such<br>as marketing for example or accounting<br>or international business as you<br>choose what clubs and extracurricular<br>activities are available ooh okay I love<br>this question cuz I love clubs so<br>Oakland uni has over 200 clubs and<br>societies these are a great way to make<br>new friends on campus expand your<br>industry networks and just have fun what<br>scholarships are available at the<br>University so scholarships and awards<br>are a great way to help Finance your<br>studies the university offers a wide<br>range of scholarships which are open to<br>both future and current uni students so<br>if you want to explore our range of<br>scholarships and awards visit the<br>website and find out which ones you're<br>eligible for and make sure to apply<br>before the deadlines do you need to come<br>to campus for your studies yes come to<br>your classes and workshops on campus and<br>experience the interactive and engaging<br>opportunities available to you here<br>they're a great chance for you to learn<br>meet new people ask your lectures and<br>just enjoy campus life our business<br>school has awesome facilities for you<br>the sir OMG Glen building has lecture<br>rooms computer labs study rooms chill<br>out areas and even a cafe we also have<br>Team based learning Labs designed for<br>group study and teaching our technology<br>Hub is a cool place with 3D printers<br>virtual reality headsets and more our<br>campus is right at the heart of Oakland<br>and there are heaps of great places to<br>grab food we have a Bookshop a pharmacy<br>and an amazing gym if you're looking for<br>a good study spot I like the K edka<br>building where there are different noise<br>level restrictions for each of the<br>floors if you were to do group work or<br>you just want to talk amongst your<br>friends you'd go to the lower floors but<br>if you're doing individual work I'd<br>recommend the higher<br>flaw what is the overall firste workload<br>like now this is a very individual<br>Endeavor of course so it's very<br>different to high school in so much that<br>you will be responsible for managing<br>your personal and university life as<br>most appropriate but typically your<br>workload will be around 30 to 40 hours<br>per week or about 10 hours per course<br>per week what kind of industry<br>connections does the business school<br>have now this is really exciting and<br>it's a really unique<br>part of what you can expect at the<br>business school we have various<br>networking opportunities that allow to<br>meet the right people to gain<br>internships and work experience our<br>business school career center hosts a<br>wide range of employer networking events<br>including presentations workshops lots<br>of opportunities to interact with<br>industry and understand what it is<br>they're looking for and what you can<br>expect to be doing in real world<br>business practice these events also help<br>you to Showcase your skills to Industry<br>meet potential employers and practice<br>your networking skills what was really<br>exciting as an example last year as part<br>of some marketing coursework was a<br>partnership with Samsung New Zealand on<br>the design and delivery and deployment<br>of a marketing campaign for a brand new<br>phone they were launching in the New<br>Zealand Marketplace to specifically the<br>cohort in The Wider Market of whom were<br>in the classroom so they were really<br>getting opportunity to work on a<br>marketing plan to Market to their peers<br>a brand new product which was really<br>exciting for the students involved<br>what advice do you have for future<br>students I really encourage future<br>students to join a club and take every<br>opportunity that they can in fact I<br>encourage everyone to even go a bit<br>overboard with their extracurriculars in<br>my first year I joined 10 clubs which<br>might sound like a lot but through these<br>clubs I was able to meet so many<br>wonderful people which I wouldn't have<br>been able to if I just strictly stayed<br>to my classes any advice for future<br>students so you probably saw this coming<br>but it will definitely be to join Club<br>many of the friends that I've made<br>through uni were through joining clubs<br>because I know it could be hard to make<br>friends at your lectures but through<br>clubs you all have shared interests and<br>all the events are so exciting fun and<br>wholesome to attend so yeah definitely<br>join clubs what career opportunities can<br>I expect after graduating from the<br>business school where do I start the<br>versatility of a business degree offers<br>lots of opportunity in The Wider<br>Marketplace there are so many career<br>options with a business degree our<br>students are highly sought after to buy<br>Employers in New Zealand and<br>internationally so you can become a<br>qualified accountant or even launch your<br>own startup most importantly we are here<br>to guide and support you on your<br>Learning Journey and in finding a career<br>that most interests you we hope that's<br>given you an insight into our programs<br>and life at the business school if you<br>want to find out more visit our website<br>and we look

everyone<br>yeah not anyone and everyone yeah I'll<br>take that out that's a little bit<br>gratuitous it's not it stopped sending<br>messages because it thought it was fine<br>but I replied and then it came I said Hi<br>and then all of them came okay pineapple<br>should be on Pizza cuz I think the<br>pineapple the juice really balances with<br>the greasiness of the ham yeah that
