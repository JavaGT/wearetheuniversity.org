accurate.</p><p>hi thank you so much for joining us<br>today we're going to give you the inside<br>scoop of what it's like to be a business<br>school student here at the University of<br>Oakland my name is Matthew lay and I<br>take a bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor<br>of Science conjoint majoring in business<br>analytics marketing and psychology and I<br>went to Rosman College yeah so can you<br>guys please introduce yourselves as well<br>hi I'm amik I study a bachelor of<br>Commerce majoring in international<br>business and operation Supply Chain<br>management and I went to St Matthews<br>Collegiate hey my name is Cohen I'm<br>studying a conjoint of Law and commerce<br>majoring in operations and Supply Chain<br>management and marketing and I went to<br>elim Christian College I chose to study<br>at the University of ockland for quite a<br>few reasons actually um one of them was<br>cuz I wanted to stay in Oakland love my<br>hometown here at Oakland and another one<br>was because my sister went to University<br>of Oakland and she told me about all the<br>great experiences she's had she studies<br>Health Science um and computer<br>management and yeah I went to a few open<br>days saw how amazing the campus was saw<br>how nice OGB was and I was like yeah<br>that's definitely the way to go yeah<br>what about you guys I chose the<br>University of Oakland because it<br>reminded me the most of a city and like<br>going to open days as well it just it<br>was such an interesting way of the way<br>the University was integrated into the<br>City and I loved looking at OGB thinking<br>like wow this building looks incredible<br>it's so new I'm so excited to study here<br>but I chose Oakland as well just cuz it<br>reminded me the most of the of the city<br>just compared to like other universities<br>in Oakland and also cuz it just ranked<br>the best in New Zealand yeah not I guess<br>like copy answers but they pulled out<br>all the stops for the OGB open day I<br>mean it was the new building the fancy<br>one everyone was excited to be here even<br>the law school and K ego all those types<br>it was nice to see all the students<br>around all the freedom um and yeah like<br>you rank number one so no complaints for<br>sureit no seeing that like those ticker<br>symbols like outside the bmz training<br>room that sold me I saw that I was like<br>wao it's got to it's got to be the<br>player oh they're making money<br>here did you guys um like only apply for<br>University of Oakland cuz that's what I<br>did yeah only it was the only option to<br>be it was the only option I mean what<br>more do you need<br>y wait Cohen What majors do you take um<br>so my business majors are operations and<br>Supply Chain management and marketing um<br>so kind of for marketing what interested<br>me was more so not the actual marketing<br>itself but kind of consumer psychology<br>and what kind of gets people into shops<br>what makes them buy things what kind of<br>influences the choices they make and<br>then for Ops management it was more so<br>just kind of like a I needed another<br>paper that I found it interesting and<br>wasn't too difficult so yeah um I think<br>Al management is a pretty good paper if<br>anyone wants to take it I'd probably<br>recommend it you learn a lot of good<br>skills EXL skills um just normal stuff<br>yeah yeah I definitely agree with offs<br>management cuz I changed my Majors um in<br>the first year I was doing commercial<br>law and international business but then<br>I realized commercial law wasn't for me<br>so I then swapped Ops and realized that<br>I actually really really enjoyed it and<br>international business I started next<br>semester but so far I'm really enjoying<br>it yeah how about you Matthew yeah I<br>take uh business analytics and marketing<br>for my Commerce side I wanted to go into<br>psychology um and I took Commerce as<br>sort of like a backup um thing to<br>supplement my psych but I absolutely<br>fell in love with commer to be honest um<br>I was surrounded by a whole bunch of<br>people who are you know doing startups<br>who are going um into the big four they<br>like really knew what they were going to<br>do and yeah I think now Commerce might<br>be my sort of main um degree and yeah<br>it's a bit off topic but like you<br>mentioned startups especially in the<br>business school hence like the business<br>aspect you get a lot of people that are<br>interested in that type of stuff and<br>like kind of starting their own<br>businesses and their own Ventures which<br>is super cool it's nice to be a part of<br>yeah you have a lot of people are taking<br>so much initiative and just pursuing<br>what they're after and just the support<br>that the business school has and the<br>university has it's so easy to just come<br>up with an idea and just follow through<br>with it what courses have you guys<br>enjoyed so far I'm loving all of my<br>stage two courses just cuz it's like the<br>most tailored to what I really want to<br>do in the end yeah I think for me is<br>probably um digital marketing we were<br>lucky in our semester we had Samsung<br>come in and partner with the course so<br>we got to design a whole ad campaign for<br>them for one semester we got to um do<br>interviews with Samsung you know get<br>access to a bit of like behind the<br>scenes info so that was pretty cool and<br>then at the end of it we had three win<br>groups that won phones that was<br>sponsored so that was probably like yeah<br>the best<br>one did you get a phone you know sadly<br>no yeah that's okay you know you all do<br>marketing so maybe you'll be able to<br>surely was it like 302 304 304 304 I<br>think my favorite course was business12<br>actually yeah wait it might be<br>like when we had to like design the<br>products and then use the unleash space<br>to like 3D print products that was like<br>so cool making that video and like like<br>a whole like product pitch it was just<br>so handson and you got to like try out<br>all the things that the university<br>offered like I've never 3D printed<br>before and then we we got to actually<br>demo our product that was that was<br>something really cool yeah so as a<br>student at the business school what's<br>your typical day looking<br>like uh for myself my day it kind of<br>varies Monday Tuesday I have no classes<br>but I have a few like club stuff to do<br>but I guess on average I usually have<br>classes from 8:00 a.m. sadly 8:00 a.m. 8<br>a.m. oh what are those<br>choices wait why did you choose 8:00<br>a.m. classes you know what I wish I had<br>a choice but 8 a is kind of the only<br>option for some of them sadly stud<br>that's so rough thankfully they're kind<br>of interesting so you know we make it<br>work we make it work yeah I usually try<br>and grab lunch with some friends maybe<br>do a bit of uni work club stuff and then<br>I usually finish maybe around like 5 to<br>6 on a bad day but usually if I'm if I'm<br>lucky I try and get out of here by like<br>1 or two it's not too bad oh okay very<br>different to Mine mine's pretty full on<br>so it's like wake up go for a run try to<br>get all that done head into uni and then<br>when I'm at Uni lectures do uni work at<br>Uni I try to leave all my uni work here<br>so by the time it hits like 5:00 I<br>should have done all my uni work so that<br>after then I can either just go home go<br>to work and just not take it home very<br>very different case in the weekends yeah<br>yeah every week is completely different<br>for me at least um you know on this<br>Monday I I was staying uh at Kate edar<br>studying with friends I just wanted to<br>get like my assignments done get them<br>you know done and dusted and you know<br>those like late night study grinds<br>they're always so much fun uh doing them<br>with friends um you know having a snack<br>from the vending machine and having<br>those like midnight yapping sessions Oho<br>like pops off for that like late night<br>session those are busy only in those<br>evenings yeah another thing that like I<br>realize is balancing work and uni cuz I<br>do work so that's like probably 3 four<br>days out of my week where I have to stay<br>up from well I'm working from like say<br>6:00 to 11: 600 till 10:00 and then<br>after that's like whether to decide whe<br>you know if you want to do cour work<br>afterward have a coffee stay up a little<br>later or just pack it up and go straight<br>to bed yeah same I find balancing things<br>to be like quite difficult but like I<br>think it's really worth it you know cuz<br>I do two jobs and an internship so it<br>was like quite a quite a lot of hours<br>but you know um I think it's it's great<br>having both you know work work life and<br>unique balance I wouldn't I guess<br>personally recommend working if you have<br>the option but it is also nice to get<br>the opportunity to progress in your<br>studies you can progress professionally<br>and also with your friends so yeah I<br>mean yeah I also find that working it's<br>just a way to get out of uni like out of<br>that uni mindset because you're taking<br>yourself to a different space you're<br>taking a break you have to literally<br>leave all your coursework to work yeah<br>exactly what have your experiences been<br>like with the tutors and um course<br>coordinators and stuff yeah um second<br>year I actually volunteered to be a<br>classer for one of my courses so it<br>meant that I could work closer with my<br>lecture and just discussing class<br>feedback but I realized now that there's<br>a really good support system and going<br>to office hours was just an opportunity<br>to talk to your lectures about any<br>issues with the assignment or any issues<br>with coursework it's I would say they're<br>very very approachable and easy to<br>contact yeah my TR have all been pretty<br>great um I like tutorials actually quite<br>a bit um so yeah I think if you guys<br>have the time i' probably recommend<br>going um I think it's worth it and the<br>lectures and the CH is always like<br>really active on email or even on canvas<br>or P yeah you're asking questions they<br>usually get back like within a few hours<br>which is always super nice one of my<br>favorite things about the business<br>school is how many clubs that that are<br>related to the business school as well<br>um I think my favorite Club is got to be<br>the University of ockland case Club um<br>I'm an exec in this club this year and<br>you know we go into like competitions we<br>get extensive training um where we get<br>business cases and we sit in a room um<br>in teams of three or four and we just<br>strategize on um the next steps of the<br>business we analyze the case we see<br>there are key issues and uh we create a<br>whole presentation and present it to<br>judges so it's sort of like strategy<br>Consulting but condensed into you know<br>either three five 8 or 24-hour cases<br>it's so much fun uh I went through the<br>development uh Squad program it's like<br>this intensive program for I think 5<br>weeks where we just get taught<br>everything on how to crack cases how to<br>work in a team um insights uh for like<br>key businesses and stuff like that and<br>after this we get to go into the case<br>program where we get to compete against<br>other univers ities even go<br>International um there are teams this<br>year going to Thailand and Hong Kong and<br>Singapore so yeah it's it's amazing<br>definitely join a university of Oakland<br>case Club I think that's well it's my<br>favorite Club yeah yeah now I've done a<br>few case competitions which were very<br>fun very interesting it's kind of just<br>an introduction to Consulting in a way<br>yeah yeah know I'm involved in unu<br>ockland and the ockland university<br>Commerce Students Association yes acsa<br>is yeah acsa it's just a great place to<br>meet people who are part of commer who<br>are willing to support you and you<br>realize that there's so many people<br>taking similar Majors to you and then<br>you could ask them for help you know get<br>their feedback but also just make<br>friends as well and their social events<br>are so fun accsa oh yeah you should<br>definitely go to them and then new and<br>youth Oakland is just a youth for Youth<br>Organization and we host events for high<br>school students Nursery students and I<br>personally just love it because I feel<br>like I formed such a good family there<br>and it's just a nice little home base<br>for me yeah you know I've also done few<br>case competitions so clearly case club's<br>where it's at yes<br>always um but yeah like for myself I'm<br>part of the um velocity Innovation<br>entrepreneurship program I'm also an<br>exact on that like you and we kind of<br>help uh pretty much students and staff<br>and anyone that attends University of<br>Oakland create startups um work in their<br>businesses scale their businesses up um<br>you know anything to do with pretty much<br>Innovation entrepreneurship if that's<br>kind of what you guys are interested in<br>come to us we'll help you out sort you<br>out so we do like two main challenges<br>throughout the year right now we have<br>our ideas challenge going on so pretty<br>much what that is is kind of like an<br>entry level challenge all we ask is that<br>people send in a 1,000w business<br>proposal for their chance to win $1,000<br>cash no strings attached<br>yeah I mean if you guys got ideas it's<br>four entries per person and you can<br>enter in the group so feel free four<br>entries be four crazy ideas literally<br>and you could get like 1K per idea okay<br>per idea so we got 25 winners and then<br>faculty sponsors as well which is super<br>nice thanks to business school um but<br>yeah and then like in semester 2 we have<br>a bigger version called the 100K<br>challenge so what that is is pretty much<br>we asked for a super in-depth proposal<br>on what your business idea is that could<br>also be the same idea used in the 100K<br>CH uh in the ideas challenge in 7 one<br>feel free to bring it over or bring<br>something new um what that is is we ask<br>for propos<br>over the course of around eight not<br>eight sorry 5 6 weeks we have a bunch of<br>development hubs which look at things<br>like market analysis uh getting a right<br>customer segment have you analyzed the<br>problem correctly is this actually a<br>market that could be penetrated and then<br>we do a whole prize giving we have five<br>winners um people can win up to 20K as a<br>formal investment into their business I<br>know yeah so please we invite everyone<br>to enter and then also you only need a<br>single person from your team to be a<br>current uni student or staff member so<br>if you have friends outside the uni that<br>you know are interested in this type of<br>stuff just bring them yeah inv them have<br>you guys made friends on campus I was<br>actually at halls in my first<br>year that's how I met you yeah we were<br>together and I found that it was such a<br>good experience it was so easy cuz<br>everyone's so willing to make friends<br>but then this year it definitely has<br>been a little more challenging so you do<br>have to make a bit more of an effort<br>saying like Labs or in clubs you have to<br>be like hi my name is amama nice to meet<br>you what are you doing what I'm studying<br>this but I guess just it's not that hard<br>in a way it's hard but it's not that<br>hard cuz you know once you put yourself<br>out there it's pretty easy and just<br>comes natur trally at the end of it all<br>yeah it's not it's not that deep I mean<br>it's really not that deep I think<br>everyone at Uni wants to make friends<br>wants to Branch out it's just everyone's<br>scared to take that first step so if<br>you're in like a lecture or tutorial and<br>you want to be like oh hey by the way is<br>this seat free my name so and so a lot<br>of the time people are happy to have<br>that conversation if you're more<br>introverted or more shy like the best<br>way like find some random person that's<br>like yapping at the start of like a<br>leure and just like sit next to them and<br>like yo my name's uh you know they'll<br>talk to you at some point throughout<br>this lecture yeah yeah where do you guys<br>normally study I normally study in the<br>mornings I find that level two and level<br>three OGB the case rooms they're usually<br>pretty free it's nice to get like a bit<br>of hard good work done you have to be<br>there really early though for the the<br>room yeah I to just grab a coffee<br>downstairs at the cafe and then like<br>find a room yeah I'm just like okay I'm<br>here for a bit let me get my work done<br>um but yeah other than that I think like<br>K EG is always a good spot four levels<br>you know<br>silent definitely snack silent daddy<br>exactly how about you guys um I love<br>Clock Tower like that's my little gate<br>cep spot I adore Clock Tower it's just a<br>nice little aesthetic study you get to<br>walk through campus like just a little<br>Greenery bit and then you get to sit<br>there you know get your work done I<br>think the OGB computer labs are quite<br>nice when when there's like no bookings<br>or anything have you guys checked out<br>the new Arts Building to study yes it is<br>such a nice building so fancy I know and<br>they got like the food c in there as<br>well now oh you have the microwave as<br>well it's easier to just heat up food<br>eat while studying and there's like a<br>food bowl table right yes yeah yeah yes<br>so good yeah alth to be fair the uni<br>done like a lot of Rena cuz even um<br>level one the mezanine in the library<br>now is super nice cuz they have super<br>open like open setting with bean bags<br>and big tables and they have like boots<br>as well with with whiteboards and<br>everything yeah yeah yeah so there are a<br>lot of like Support Services here at the<br>uni um have you guys used any and if so<br>what's what's your favorite ones I<br>usually contact people from the student<br>Development Center so that just helps me<br>with like my extracurricular so with<br>like you and youth Oakland and accsa it<br>means that you know I can go to them for<br>bookings organization and just how to<br>plan an event but also something that I<br>have tapped into was um the career<br>center just getting my CV checked<br>getting my LinkedIn checked and just<br>getting their input on you know how to<br>progress in that whole career space as<br>well yeah con yeah I think SAS is like a<br>really good SP especially when it's time<br>for that oh so loved internship season<br>everyone's cramming to get done Much<br>Madness yeah C's kind of they're pretty<br>pretty really good for like getting ocv<br>done up to part and actually including<br>the things that um recruiters want to<br>see just remember that there are a lot<br>of support services and you're not alone<br>at the University and there's always<br>someone there to help you as a business<br>student I think networking and career<br>development is like really important<br>right like I remember um getting doing<br>passport to business yes uh there was so<br>many um career opportunities and and<br>networking opportunities with like the<br>big four ey deoe and it's so cool like<br>getting to know them and really seeing<br>what they do and also like with the UAC<br>well University of Oran case club we got<br>invited to Goldman Sachs yeah we had a<br>tour of their<br>office their food was so nice yeah and<br>we got to talk to some of their<br>investment bankers and yeah these guys<br>are just so smart and it's so it's so<br>nice getting to network with these<br>people and see what it's truly like to<br>work in the industry yeah what about you<br>guys I think networking is like<br>something you'll have a LoveHate<br>relationship with by the time you leave<br>uni I mean it's it's so valuable but<br>then sometimes it feels like a bit much<br>I think as long as you're willing to put<br>yourself out there networking could be<br>the most valuable resource that you can<br>get at Uni and not even just with<br>companies but like with your fellow<br>students as well cuz you never know you<br>never know where they're going to go<br>yeah<br>exactly yeah the careers Expo so I went<br>to it last year out of interest and then<br>this year as well but more so just to<br>build my connections and this year I<br>found it was really useful just cuz it<br>meant that you know I could be in touch<br>with them also re like get their links<br>in but then also get to know them and<br>like what their experiences are like cuz<br>I also realized that you know all the<br>information you get on internships you<br>can find that on their website so when<br>you actually talk to them in person try<br>get them to get to know you so when you<br>apply they like oh I remember them make<br>it like personal yes exactly and that's<br>just the great opportunity that you have<br>with networking you get to know people<br>on that level rather than not that<br>here's my CV yeah I think you mentioned<br>LinkedIn as well LinkedIn is like if<br>you're thinking about entering business<br>school or just even general make your<br>LinkedIn LinkedIn it doesn't even need<br>to be like up to scratch but as long as<br>you have one we into uni I think it will<br>develop as you develop yeah when you're<br>networking with all these people it's<br>like they have all these years of<br>experience and now you get a chance to<br>like not have to go through these 30<br>years of employment but just get like<br>the key the key facts out of it you just<br>get to ask them you know what you're<br>after 100% yeah I wish I knew to not<br>compare myself with others as much as<br>well um that was something that I<br>struggled with a lot in first year I was<br>always trying to you know get ahead be<br>be a top student stuff like this but<br>realistically we're all you know doing<br>our own things you don't have to have<br>everything figured out in the first year<br>especially um like even until now I<br>don't have my entire career like mapped<br>out but I do have more of a general idea<br>it sort of progresses you learn what you<br>like what have been your biggest<br>highlights since coming to<br>University I've got to say living at<br>wiper oh yeah yeah the H experience is<br>something else like you just get to know<br>people so well in that short amount of<br>time um all the like late night study<br>sessions um you know just like having<br>midnight chats um randomly cooking yes<br>yes and then yeah there's so many like<br>events and activities that go on with<br>halls I think that's Yeah by far to me<br>is my biggest highlight in this<br>University yeah what about you guys<br>probably be the clubs um I think the<br>clubs are super fun there's a whole wide<br>range of them that people can kind of<br>join at and especially the student lead<br>clubs it's not business school specific<br>you'll get people from maybe like<br>engineering or from law or from computer<br>science is just a super fun way to make<br>friends yeah just knowing that it's my<br>calendar I can move things around as I<br>please and you know it's not like high<br>school where this is you're at school<br>from 8 to 3 or something like that and<br>then you have sport afterward and then<br>you have to work around all of that you<br>know it's your choice you choose when<br>you want to have lectures when you want<br>to have tutorials or labs and then<br>choose what you want to fill in with<br>your day and that's for me has just been<br>so it feels so fulfilling knowing that<br>like I can accomplish what I want in a<br>day up to my standards or my capacity<br>yeah having more control in like your<br>day-to-day is quite nicer yeah<br>definitely it's like even something as<br>simple as deciding when you want to have<br>lunch yes oh sorry it's like what time<br>to get up what time to get up before a<br>lecture take a nap during the day yeah<br>do you guys have any other General kind<br>of advice that you wish you would have<br>had if you know coming into uni uh I<br>would definitely say it's okay to make<br>yourself uncomfortable and you<br>definitely should make yourself<br>uncomfortable just cuz it's getting out<br>of your comfort zone you know seeing<br>what else you can accomplish beyond your<br>current<br>means yeah and then probably just to<br>add-on is like you're not the only one<br>that's uncomfortable everyone's just as<br>uncomfortable so don't ever let I guess<br>your nervousness be something or a<br>reason to like not try something you're<br>only here for like maybe 3 4 years and<br>university has so much to offer that you<br>couldn't do it all within 3 4 years so<br>like legit take every opportunity accept<br>it and then figure out how to do after<br>that's probably like yeah I actually<br>have three pieces of advice if that's<br>okay yes go for it um first off uh<br>something I learned from the case Club<br>process over results um always always<br>take things step by step um if you<br>ensure that your process is great the<br>end goal would always be um something<br>something great as well mhm uh second<br>piece of advice is make a lot of friends<br>especially friends in your courses um<br>you know uh doing assignments studying<br>together is is so much more enjoyable<br>when you're doing it with others you<br>know what they say is like if you want<br>to uh get somewhere fast do it alone if<br>you want to uh get go far uh do it with<br>friends something like that um and my<br>third advice is don't skip meals yeah I<br>think that's something I struggle with<br>sometimes when I'm um you know studying<br>a lot um I forget to eat um forget to be<br>well hydrated don't skip anything for<br>yourself take care of yourself
