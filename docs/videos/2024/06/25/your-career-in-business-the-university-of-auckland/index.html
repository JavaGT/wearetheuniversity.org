accurate.</p><p>K uh my name is Park uh I'm currently a<br>sustainability consultant at Edge impact<br>which is an advisory firm uh and I<br>studied a bachelor of Commerce in<br>accounting and supply chain and I did my<br>high school overseas in Singapore as I<br>said I studied accounting and supply<br>chain and I think what that major sort<br>of like works on is you know you're<br>building your business skills and being<br>analytic and being really proficient<br>with understanding the world of business<br>but however I actually think that um my<br>major didn't fully lead me into my role<br>it definitely aroused this sort of<br>curiosity uh in terms of what the<br>business world was about uh and then I<br>started to think about well what can<br>business do for good uh what is its<br>broader contribution to society and I<br>think that led me into a very different<br>role and hence I started looking into<br>sustainability um climate change and<br>human rights and that's what I'm<br>passionate about I think there are<br>definitely many different avenues for<br>support uh the main one I leaned on was<br>actually the career center so shout out<br>to TS and and Peta for being really<br>instrumental and I think like really<br>helping me to get my get my footing in<br>University to getting good advice on how<br>to excel uh in my internships uh to<br>providing good advice even until today I<br>think on like career options and<br>Pathways and uh and things that I needed<br>to do do well to you know Excel my<br>career there are really a lot of<br>different options I think in terms of<br>clubs and extracurriculars you can get<br>involved in like two of them I guess<br>that I was really excited about first<br>was impact Consulting Group and<br>basically um we help uh nonprofits and<br>social Enterprises with any business<br>issues um that they come forward with uh<br>and we use those skills to basically<br>ensure that they're maximizing impact uh<br>because they might not be able to afford<br>for um Regular consulting services and<br>so we come in uh as a learning<br>experience we work with them and try to<br>understand their needs and we try to<br>build a solution that helps everyone I<br>think the second one as well is velocity<br>and that's a group that really focuses<br>on Innovation and Entrepreneurship as<br>someone I guess coming in without any<br>understanding of what a startup was uh<br>how to scale a business it really was<br>the One-Stop shop but also the beginning<br>point of my own personal entrepreneur<br>ship journey and helping me to<br>understand yeah like what sort of what<br>business looks like what business for<br>good as well looks like there are so<br>many options to network and build those<br>connections and relationships that you<br>need to excel in the future uh I<br>remember going into like a hackathon on<br>social entrepreneurship and actually one<br>of the judges um was someone that I<br>interned for later on just because I<br>grabbed like a random coffee we hit it<br>off really well and there was an<br>opportunity right in front of me and so<br>yeah absolutely I think there are so<br>many Pathways for networking building<br>relationships and ensuring that you're<br>getting to know people as you study and<br>real life relationships help you so much<br>more as you progress through your<br>journey in University so my role as a<br>sustainability consultant involves me um<br>looking at climate change and human<br>rights issues mostly for the government<br>and for the private sector essentially<br>they come to us with a specific problem<br>perhaps they're not understanding the<br>human rights issues in their supply<br>chain or they're trying to adapt to the<br>different impacts of a warming climate<br>and we provide them with Solutions<br>recommendations and Pathways for change<br>I would say like I don't have uh a<br>linear path uh towards getting the role<br>that I'm in right now what I started<br>with was a whole lot of naivity uh a<br>passion to want to change the world in<br>my own different way and being really<br>focused about raising awareness about<br>climate change uh which I think is a<br>really defining challenge for our<br>generation and you know a lot of a lot<br>of knows from people that we we we can't<br>do anything about climate change but<br>also trying to find my own opportunities<br>trying to network to get my way through<br>and eventually landing on a few lucky<br>lucky few takes you know like there was<br>a a big firm that that really said yes<br>and and that this was a a big priority<br>for them and then start start going from<br>there working in different Industries<br>hustling basically to get through I<br>think my job has brought me into some<br>very different spaces I've created a<br>workshop for a winery to be more<br>sustainable in their operations working<br>with eie Marty to create bicultural<br>strategies and intergenerational<br>strategies and I've also been really<br>lucky to work with uh one of New<br>Zealand's largest museums to think about<br>what strategy building and storytelling<br>mean means for us um in a world of<br>climate change in a world of Crisis and<br>yet opportunity and so these are some of<br>the interesting examples uh there are<br>parts of our jobs that require us to<br>hunker down and deal with the numbers<br>and deal with the words and there's also<br>opportunities to get out there to<br>understand what your clients actually<br>want I don't think I quite attribute<br>success or an accomplishment to my<br>career through any one specific thing I<br>did I think it really was Having the<br>courage to see something in a world that<br>needed changing it was noticing that our<br>voices are more powerful when they're<br>combined and it was realizing that more<br>of us needed to be part of this movement<br>to work on climate change to see this as<br>something that not only<br>impacted us as human beings but would<br>impact the way we did business it would<br>change the way our governments would<br>think about critical issues in our lives<br>and to do something about that and sure<br>like it's led me now to really<br>interesting places to talk about climate<br>change Health impacts of climate you<br>know and human rights impacts and I'm<br>really proud of that but the most<br>important thing to me is to stand tll<br>for something that you hold very dearly<br>and to have the conviction to to follow<br>that through having the conviction to<br>create the career you want the path you<br>want<br>and yeah that's something I'm really<br>proud of my hot take is that University<br>is no longer the time for you to aim for<br>a 9.0 GPA getting all those a pluses and<br>being a role model student it's actually<br>the time for you to form the friendships<br>and relationships that matter but also<br>for you to reflect on what you are<br>passionate about what you would like to<br>materialize and bring into our world and<br>University can then be this place to<br>find the right Network and connections<br>to make it happen finding the right<br>Tutors or the right mentors to give you<br>the advice and perhaps even finding the<br>resources to make sure that that's<br>something you want to make happen but<br>this is the time for you not to listen<br>only but to also actively create to be<br>part of the future you want to be part<br>of and so that's my biggest piece of<br>advice reflect critically on what makes<br>you tick what you're passionate about<br>and find a way to make it happen<br>hello I am Winona DEA and um I am a<br>change agent and entrepreneur I studied<br>um a bachelor of Commerce at the<br>University of Oakland business school<br>majoring in marketing and Innovation<br>entrepreneurship and I went to Mount<br>Albert grar I've always had sort of this<br>entrepreneurial spark inside of me I<br>think it was fostered by my parents<br>which I'm so fortunate for both of them<br>have run um their own businesses and<br>continue to do so<br>um when I was 9 years old I um wanted to<br>I was living in in the UK at the time I<br>really wanted to come back and visit my<br>family um in New Zealand and my parents<br>said great how are you going to do it<br>and so that how are you going to do it<br>is very much instilled there's no real<br>kind of barrier in in a problem and I<br>think that's why I love change because<br>it means you know being able to lean<br>into a right let's problem solve this<br>and and work it through I started at the<br>University of ockland business school<br>when I was 21 um I had a 1-year-old<br>child and it really became evident to me<br>that I needed a really I needed a<br>community um and I needed to have<br>something which at that time I thought<br>would be the piece of paper that would<br>prove that I knew what I knew from<br>reading the books that I enjoyed it was<br>really an opportunity to prove myself um<br>and what I didn't realize that I would<br>get was um you know the best friends I<br>could have ever asked for and lecturers<br>who are still my mentors to this<br>day studying Innovation and<br>Entrepreneurship at the University of<br>Oakland meant getting together in<br>classrooms and building hypothetical<br>businesses working out how we would take<br>them to Market and having fun along the<br>way I really enjoyed studying um<br>Innovation entrepreneurship at the same<br>time as building unleash Bas it meant<br>that everything that I was learning<br>theoretically in the classroom was<br>applied immediately in The Works Space<br>essentially for me and to be able to you<br>know work with my peers talk to them and<br>and really have um a group of people who<br>were curious and would participate in in<br>an Innovation Hub and want to be there<br>as the space in which they would choose<br>to to hang out really aided and and<br>building something that was fit for<br>purpose for students unleash Bas is an<br>Innovation Hub and um entrepreneural<br>zone for students and staff to come in<br>and prototype and ideate with one<br>another you've got access to mentors um<br>and really the resources in order to be<br>able to um prototype and um actually<br>figure out whether a business is is<br>viable potentially meet some of your<br>co-founders build up your team and um<br>just be in a space which just feels very<br>vibrant it's called the Orange bubble<br>for a reason the people that study<br>Innovation entrepreneurship are the most<br>diverse and in the um papers that I have<br>have taken they are just so inherently<br>curious and they're they're quite quirky<br>and fun because they've often sort of<br>done their businesses and in terms of it<br>could be as as simple as something as a<br>as a lemonade stand and that's got them<br>into thinking oh I could I could run a<br>business too I was part of the marketing<br>clubs the um tedex university of Oakland<br>I'm sort of founding team and I was part<br>of the Marty and Pacifica Commerce<br>Association what it gave me was like<br>people who were interested in the same<br>things of me who were likeminded but who<br>came from completely different<br>backgrounds so um just because we had<br>the same interest didn't mean that we<br>were the same person so that diversity<br>of thought was like ever present having<br>Tana having that community of um Mar and<br>Pacifica who I could sit down and<br>Converse with and learn with and keep<br>accountable from um was such a blessing<br>um having the lecture office hours I<br>remember<br>when um I took my um Grandma to sour and<br>it was right at the Crux of like a very<br>um integral part of of the semester and<br>I knew um well under us was the only<br>time that we were going to be able to go<br>and um ad meant that I was able to work<br>backwards with my lecturer to make sure<br>that I had everything done before I was<br>able to go tabut is a wonderful<br>organization that um supports Marty and<br>Pacifica into um organizations through<br>internships and graduate programs<br>I could never imagine myself being in<br>banking until I was part of tuut I went<br>into a and z for 8 weeks and it<br>shattered every expectation and<br>preconception I had of the banking<br>industry there was so many incredible<br>female leaders which I learned so much<br>from who just wrapped um their support<br>around me within those those 8 weeks I<br>moved from University to um running my<br>own Consulting to working in banking to<br>then working in the public sector for<br>New Zealand Police but every single job<br>that I have taken was this underlying<br>nigle of I belong an entrepreneurship<br>and I am I meant to run my own business<br>so I left my job and now I am building a<br>um adventure with the the underlying<br>mission that I really want to support<br>100,000 women to be able to embrace<br>change and I'm chatting to you know the<br>most incredible women who have<br>experienced a huge range of different<br>personal and professional changes in<br>their life it's a really exciting time<br>and nerve-wracking and and you really<br>have to kind of take the leap and and<br>have faith and in in your ability to do<br>that but um I've proven at University<br>that I can do hard things and a lot of<br>things and so yeah I know that I can do<br>it again I think like the confidence<br>that I got from going to University I<br>was so like I was so confused before I<br>went to University about what I wanted<br>to do um both for myself and and within<br>the world I was I was really like<br>pleasantly surprised at um like how much<br>of a trajectory change going to<br>University gave me like I went thinking<br>it was just going to be this<br>sort of piece of paper that proved my<br>worth and actually what it gave me was<br>actually building like my worth there's<br>so many opportunities and there's<br>there's so much potential to explore new<br>things and at University it's safe it's<br>an environment that people are willing<br>it my name is Mian prash um I did a<br>bachelor at the University of Oakland um<br>business school in Innovation<br>entrepreneurship uh management and<br>operation supply chain currently doing<br>my masters in Global Management and<br>Innovation and um my current role is a<br>supply chain or business graduate here<br>at fona and uh my high school is a<br>little old school up Northland uh Spring<br>Bank um up near k k I originally did the<br>Young Enterprise scheme was involved<br>with that for a number of years did<br>business um in high school and that<br>really helped me choose the the degree<br>that I'm currently doing uh well did and<br>um I think when I joined into University<br>this was roughly 2020 uh Co hit pandemic<br>hit Supply chains were pretty much<br>crumbling left right and center and then<br>uh I made a conscious decision to also<br>take up supply chain and so that kind of<br>set my my path forward uh in both the<br>supply chain space and The Innovation<br>entrepreneurship space so yeah I went in<br>wanting to do Innovation<br>entrepreneurship and then I left looking<br>at Supply chains as an opportunity<br>inspiration wise um I think it started<br>with uh my family so we we run a small<br>family business up north uh in the<br>hospitality and restaurant space and<br>that really got me uh interested in the<br>food space especially uh I grew up in a<br>small rural town up there um where a lot<br>of farmers typically tend to come along<br>and and have chats and conversations and<br>so I really got to connect with them and<br>and learn more about what they do for<br>our community and so that inspired me to<br>really explore the food space a lot more<br>um and you know I think it was just<br>being in the right place at the right<br>time learning about fona learning about<br>their opportunities and then uh applying<br>for the program that came along I think<br>a business degree is not something about<br>making money you know it is a part of it<br>yes but I think it's more so the idea of<br>um people connecting with people growing<br>relationships um innovating in spaces<br>that you wouldn't think you could really<br>touch um I think it's so uh diverse the<br>field that you're involved with um you<br>could be you know one day working in<br>engineering as I was with with form C<br>next you could be working with biotech<br>the next you could be working in Space<br>the next you could be working in da um<br>so there is just such a wide scope um<br>that you know you're not limited um by<br>what you think a business degree is um<br>rather you're just limited by what you<br>can imagine that business degree uh to<br>take you to so the University of Oakland<br>Esports Club I was their treasurer for a<br>year when I first started University<br>learned a lot of financial skills um<br>from the there then I moved into the<br>University of Oakland uh Formula SAE 47<br>club which is our um uh a race team at<br>the University of ockland in in New<br>Market I was there for the last 2 years<br>of my degree and um I was involved with<br>their business um division as the<br>marketing manager a lot of people that I<br>got to work with and even myself uh it's<br>difficult to figure out what you want to<br>do and you know you don't really need to<br>know what you want to do when you come<br>into University first year um you<br>actually get so much Choice um with the<br>business school that you know we you<br>don't are not expected to pick your<br>major till the second year or third year<br>and so once you've kind of understood<br>and had a flavor of different um parts<br>of the business school you could come to<br>the careers's kind of leader space and<br>we were really able to help craft your<br>your entry so that you know when you<br>leave to go into the the job market you<br>you got the best<br>at Landing the kind of career that<br>you're wanting to do when I saw the<br>coupe leadership scholarship it really<br>resonated with me and I applied straight<br>after my bachelor's for it did the<br>interviews got in and it was just a a<br>fascinating leadership Journey<br>throughout the year um got to learn from<br>some amazing speakers had a great mentor<br>who really guided me not only through<br>research and and Masters but also uh for<br>for my career and going forward so Coupe<br>has been a huge huge part of my recent<br>uh life and also just the community that<br>you get to build afterwards with really<br>passionate people who are focused in in<br>so many different areas to bring uh the<br>country to to a better place uh I think<br>the favorite thing about my job is<br>definitely the people um there is so<br>many great personalities here that you<br>get to just um grab a coffee have a chat<br>about work solve problems on the spot<br>you know uh we're very open environment<br>so you can just go walk around the<br>corner chat with someone that you just<br>sent an email to see how we can solve<br>the problem um and so the people are<br>really great and and they're definitely<br>what makes this place<br>tick as well as I think the the variety<br>of work there's so much to do and<br>there's so much things to learn about um<br>it's just endless you're always learning<br>I think giving things a go I think<br>that's been the proudest part of my my<br>career pathway simply if I didn't apply<br>for uh the food and grocery internship I<br>probably you know I wouldn't have gotten<br>the nesla internship I wouldn't have<br>gone where I am today uh you know back<br>in my high school I was part of the<br>youth MP so if I didn't apply there I<br>wouldn't have um gotten the opportunity<br>to meet some great people and and set my<br>my career path up um in that space I<br>think that's the thing is just giving<br>things a go you may not fully succeed<br>and that's okay um and that's about<br>learning from it and and growing as a<br>person and so I think just giving things<br>a go was is the um the best part of my<br>career Journey so far um and it's led to<br>where I am today and and where I Look to<br>go into the future</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
