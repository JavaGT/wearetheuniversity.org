international<br>students focused on programs offering<br>being offered in 2025 and of course<br>we'll be looking at our scholarship and<br>application tips for you as well today<br>my name is Megan Smith I'm from the<br>international office at the University<br>tenot CA I'm Victoria mcari from the<br>international office and we're delighted<br>to be joined today by colleagues and<br>current students uh with us welcome<br>Fiona K I'm Fiona McDonald and I'm<br>director of the Health Sciences first<br>year program hi guys my name is Eric SE<br>I'm the second year Dentistry student at<br>the University of tago K my name is Ka<br>and I'm a second year med student here<br>at the University ofo so a warm welcome<br>and we'll look forward to connecting<br>back in with everyone a little bit uh<br>later as you can see here we have quite<br>a large agenda of topics to work through<br>and we're going to cut straight into it<br>um kicking off with why otago and<br>introducing the University of atago in<br>brief to you so the University of atago<br>is New Zealand's first University the<br>first and oldest and we're ranked among<br>the world's top one% of universities we<br>have 21,000 students and over 2 and a<br>half thousand International students who<br>come from over 90 different countries<br>atago has a very broad uh range of<br>opportunities for you to study across a<br>range of subjects and qualifications and<br>crucially 95% of our graduates go on to<br>further study or employment uh post<br>their completion of their study with us<br>we are also five five star accredited uh<br>with the Qs uh ranking and rating system<br>uh so that's a great start but one of my<br>favorite personal uh rankings is in fact<br>our beautiful campus it really is a<br>campus like no other in New Zealand or<br>Australia and it's a very special place<br>to be as a student uh indeed it's been<br>considered one of the most beautiful in<br>the world which is rather nice it's<br>today not looking quite like that it is<br>winter today so we we're not wearing our<br>shorts out there uh when considering a<br>university rankings are often something<br>that people do look to and consider and<br>it's great to see here uh that itago is<br>ranked 214th best in the world uh<br>furthermore subjectwise we are extremely<br>strong in a number of areas and that<br>includes a and Physiology 30th best in<br>the world uh Dentistry 40th best in the<br>world uh nursing is ranked very highly<br>as well as is indeed medicine uh public<br>health and other related areas the point<br>of this uh information is really to show<br>you uh the breadth and depth of research<br>and education quality at the University<br>of<br>atago now one thing before we jump into<br>Health Sciences I forgot to mention at<br>the start is that uh this webinar is<br>very specifically focused on internet<br>National students so just in ch by<br>chance if you are a domestic New Zealand<br>student or a permanent resident the<br>information for today is uh not really<br>suitable for you uh this is targeted<br>toward our international student<br>audience all right Victoria let's hear<br>about Health Sciences thank you so<br>within our division of Health Sciences<br>it's made up of five schools which we<br>list here which is the school of<br>biomedical Sciences faculty of Dentistry<br>otaro School of Medicine School of<br>Pharmacy and school of Physiotherapy and<br>later on in the webinar we'll be doing a<br>deep dive into each of these schools but<br>um as well as the sort of overall<br>rankings that U Megan talked about we<br>are very proud that we are the leading<br>New Zealand's leading Health Sciences<br>University and what does that mean that<br>means that we are home to one of the<br>oldest and largest medical schools in<br>New Zealand we've been teaching students<br>over nearly up to 155 years on um our<br>health science professions we're homes<br>the only dental school in New Zealand<br>and uh we were the we've got the oldest<br>pharmacy school that was established at<br>otago and we're incredibly proud too<br>that Oto produced the first female<br>medical graduate in<br>australasia as well as other very<br>notable alumni throughout the<br>years uh we take our teaching very<br>seriously so we are a research intensive<br>un University and you are going to be<br>taught by some of the world leading<br>academics um as a New Zealand government<br>University and New Zealand's oldest<br>government University we um uh we have<br>the New Zealand Prime Ministers award uh<br>for Supreme award for teaching<br>excellence and Oto has won this eight<br>out of the last 11 years we're also New<br>Zealand's top university for educ<br>Education performance and that's by Tec<br>excellent um this is a wonderful this is<br>an image of the Mellows which um maybe<br>Kiana and Eric will be talking to us a<br>little bit later as you can see the<br>world class facility so we' got these<br>beautiful sort of uh traditional<br>buildings but inside we've got world<br>class facilities uh you will be based<br>especially as an undergrad in denen but<br>you may uh later on depending especially<br>in Dentistry and Medicine also get to<br>study in now other campuses around New<br>Zealand and Christ Church Wellington and<br>ockland for<br>Dentistry um we these uh degrees that<br>we're going to talk about um in this<br>next hour are internationally recognized<br>qualifications and articulate um and<br>accredited so as I was saying before we<br>have um very good teaching staff but we'<br>have also got uh we're very research<br>intensive so some of the teaching St<br>staff that may be teaching you as an<br>undergraduate they will be professors<br>they'll be senior academics that will be<br>bringing into the lecture theater into<br>the laboratory their research as<br>well fantastic well it's time for us to<br>now dip a deep dive into Health Sciences<br>first year which is a pretty critical uh<br>concept for you to learn and understand<br>when considering our professional<br>programs at atago and really excited to<br>welcome and Fiona to lead us through<br>this uh information here we<br>go right so as I said I'm director of<br>this health science first year program<br>it's quite a unique um program um you<br>might not recognize it if you're<br>elsewhere in the world but it's a<br>one-year program that we have at the<br>University of atago and it's essential<br>if you're a school Leever coming to aago<br>and wanting to move into Dentistry<br>medicine medical lab science uh Pharmacy<br>or<br>physiotherapy uh so so it's one year of<br>study and you you apply for those five<br>Health Professions towards the end of<br>the year and to be uh accepted into<br>those health professional programs the<br>grades that you get in those Health side<br>first year papers are are important<br>notice that the university has several<br>other degrees that are related to health<br>sciences um but H so first year is not<br>the first year of the Bachelor of<br>Bachelor of Health Science and we'll<br>probably come back to that degree later<br>on um so there are multiple Pathways<br>that you can go from after completing<br>the health science first year which as I<br>mentioned it's a single year program and<br>once you completed um you might move<br>into one of those five health<br>professional programs um again medicine<br>Dentistry Bachelor of um medical<br>laboratory science physiotherapy or<br>Pharmacy so a lot of our students um<br>will move into those professional<br>programs and the health science first<br>year program has been designed to set<br>students up to move um very easily into<br>those programs but in addition the<br>health science first year is an<br>excellent um starting point to move into<br>several other degrees that we offer here<br>at aago uh two of those are are um<br>degrees associated with the School of<br>Dentistry The Bachelor of oral health<br>and also the Bachelor of dental<br>technology and in addition a tiger has<br>several other degrees that you can move<br>into bachor pharmaceutical Sciences<br>biomedical Sciences health and the<br>specture of Health Sciences as well as<br>the Bachelor of Science which has<br>several Majors that are related to<br>health<br>sciences so going back to what the<br>health science first year program looks<br>like um it's run over the one year but<br>we have four papers in the first<br>semester and three papers in the second<br>semester and those seven papers um are<br>compulsory and then you may May uh pick<br>up an eighth paper in the second<br>semester to broaden your um broaden your<br>year um and we make that information<br>available at about this time next year<br>actually if you come into house so first<br>year there are a couple of other things<br>to mention around um what health first<br>year students will need to be thinking<br>about as well as studying those seven<br>papers the first is an English<br>diagnostic test uh this is compulsory<br>for both International and domestic<br>students<br>um if you're planning on applying for<br>those health professional programs you<br>have an opportunity to sit that test<br>earlier in the year and if you don't<br>quite meet the thresholds there are ways<br>that you can um show your Proficiency in<br>English during the year we have um for<br>at least one of our programs currently<br>the ukat which is required for domestic<br>um students or for international<br>students who might be become a resident<br>during the year of study and this year<br>the ukat is required for medicine<br>um and but it is under review notice<br>that for Dentistry there there is an<br>interview which kind of takes the place<br>of that<br>ukat when you come into the hellside<br>first year program you'll be starting at<br>the beginning of the Academic Year and<br>um late February early March and you're<br>not actually applying for the<br>professional programs until much later<br>in the year year with applications um<br>opening on the 1st of August and opening<br>um open for a few weeks the process is<br>quite long for um assessing students and<br>students don't receive um offers until<br>December excellent but uh f one thing<br>that comes to mind to me is of course<br>during that year working through those<br>seven courses or papers as we call them<br>there's that's quite a good time and<br>opportunity for students to possibly<br>reflect and revise plans they might have<br>thought they were thinking of or realize<br>a different passion yeah excellent point<br>Megan so uh<br>we we definitely promote um this to<br>students some students come in<br>absolutely focused on a particular<br>health professional program but by doing<br>those papers or courses they find that<br>actually they're really attracted to<br>another um area of study that they<br>hadn't even thought about or hadn't even<br>been exposed to before St starting their<br>study and that's why<br>we've um introduced those other degree<br>Pathways and we have a lot of<br>information going out to students during<br>the year we where the students can talk<br>to staff in other departments and Majors<br>to find out where um they might like to<br>go if they've decided they don't want to<br>apply for health professional<br>programs so how do we get into Health<br>Sciences first year let's have a look at<br>that Victoria sure so the academic<br>requirements to get into Health Sciences<br>first year are the same as University<br>entrance so we've listed um basically<br>the most common forms of um<br>matriculations or International<br>qualifications that are accepted now for<br>example if we take um your IB diploma a<br>minimum of 24 or more when you're say<br>comparing uh otaro to other medical<br>programs you'll be thinking gosh that's<br>Jolly low but remember this is<br>University entrance so this is getting<br>you into Health Science first year then<br>we're going to use Health Science first<br>year those seven uh compulsory papers in<br>an eighth option to basically find the<br>top students from that so when I'm I'm<br>always talking to students in the<br>appearance and education Consultants I<br>say this is the minimum to get in but<br>realistically you need to be the<br>equivalent of an a an a a grade student<br>look any good quality medical dental<br>school Pharmacy physiotherapy school it<br>is hard to get into we want the top<br>quality students one of the important<br>philosophies that the University of<br>atago is everyone should be given the<br>opportunity to prove themselves and that<br>is why our University entrance level is<br>actually very realistic for many so once<br>again getting into Health Sciences first<br>year is actually rather straightforward<br>simply meeting University entrance<br>allows you to uh to take Health Sciences<br>first year uh and again there's no limit<br>or cap to again getting a place in that<br>particular program but it is your<br>performance during the health science<br>first year courses that is what you were<br>competing uh competing on in order to<br>get into the professional programs yeah<br>sometimes overseas um students ask is<br>this the equivalent like to um a<br>one-year preed or onee pre- Dentistry<br>Fiona would you say might be a little<br>bit like that is there a way to<br>definitely is because it's a real step<br>up from high school and you are learning<br>subjects that underpin<br>all of those Health Professions and so<br>that is why the all our health<br>professional programs have they have<br>want they put in place or help to put in<br>place this first year um because it's<br>absolutely required to underpin<br>everything that you go on and learn<br>about um in the later years of your<br>degree all right so it's fairly<br>straightforward to get into Health<br>Science first year but just in case you<br>haven't quite met the university<br>entrance qualification as it stands<br>today there are options yes we do so Oto<br>university has their own Foundation<br>studies certificate um and you would<br>major in like the health science Stream<br>So basically students that are either<br>maybe year 11 or haven't been successful<br>uh they come in and do 13 weeks on<br>campus in those fabulous mellow Labs<br>that you saw and lecture theaters and<br>they are being basically taught uh the<br>equivalent of year 12 and being<br>introduced I suppose to the health<br>science first first year curriculum so<br>after 13 weeks the students know the the<br>campus well they know how to um react or<br>or be in at a Laboratory um they the<br>they know what's expected of them and<br>they've got a very small um basically<br>teacher to student ratio within the<br>classes that's right so it's two<br>semesters of 13 week study that's about<br>eight months uh in a in a um in summary<br>there are only two intakes February and<br>June for the health Sciences stream<br>because the students need to graduate in<br>time for Health Sciences first year<br>that's right okay and uh in addition<br>just in case you maybe meet the academic<br>requirements but your English is<br>slightly below our required level<br>there's the opportunity to take English<br>for otago which is a specialist um and<br>intense program we will we will support<br>you to move up um at least 0 five of an<br>ielt according to the um the the level<br>that you're coming in on uh and this is<br>a fantastic way to really top up that<br>English and well get you well prepared<br>for your studies at the University now<br>very conveniently we have an upcoming<br>webinar focused entirely on Foundation<br>studies our diplomas and indeed our<br>English language programs so if you're<br>welcome to Mark uh Thursday this week in<br>New Zealand time in your calendar if you<br>uh if this could be of interest for you<br>as<br>well all right so now we're going to<br>move into um the breadth of our<br>undergraduate health science related<br>programs and just try to give you that<br>opportunity to see there's more to<br>Health Sciences than only being a doctor<br>although that's always a very popular<br>option uh but we'll just work through<br>these degrees uh so you have a sense of<br>the offering at otaro so first off let's<br>kick start with the Bachelor of dental<br>surgery gosh what a superb program so<br>it's Health Science first year plus an<br>additional four years and at the end of<br>that you're able to uh register and um<br>practice<br>uh in New Zealand and Australia uh and<br>indeed the structure of the program is<br>rather exciting because after your<br>health science first year you then move<br>into dentistry and have another critical<br>year of cours work and lab-based work<br>before you move into your years three<br>and four at which point whilst working<br>initially with some simulation heads you<br>also start to actively work with real<br>patients real patient lists supervised<br>of course so you're getting Hands-On um<br>involvement quite early on in the pieace<br>and in time for your fifth year with us<br>at which point you have effectively a<br>fouryear placement either in denen in a<br>clinical setting or at our fabulous<br>Oakland dental facility uh so there's<br>really excellent hands-on experience<br>through our Dentistry program and a real<br>um pride and joy for us this program<br>it's uh we are New Zealand's National<br>Dentistry School uh you can see a few<br>other important facts but something uh<br>actually I would like to highlight is<br>that our Dentistry facility here in in<br>denen was rebuilt and remodeled just a<br>few years ago so we actually have one of<br>if not the most modern facility in the<br>world right now it's a stunning facility<br>to work in with um tertiary Hospital<br>Dentistry Hospital level as well as uh<br>clinical areas and of course uh<br>simulation labs and patient areas and<br>study areas so oh fantastic program so<br>admission into the Bachelor of Dentistry<br>is based again on your performance and<br>Health Sciences first year you must<br>achieve a minimum average of 70% in each<br>of those courses uh but there is a 20<br>minute interview which is a critical<br>part of selection as well now with the<br>other professional programs it's handy<br>to know that International students are<br>only competing with the other<br>International students uh to secure a<br>place there are specific a specific<br>number of international places um but<br>you're not competing with all the<br>domestic<br>students okay related to oral health and<br>Dentistry we have a three-year Bachelor<br>of dental technology uh and this is a<br>pretty exciting professional program in<br>only 3 years allowing you to support um<br>the sort of design and manufacturer and<br>repair or um uh you know the working<br>with the more technical uh elements of<br>Dentistry um and probably Eric could<br>speak to this better than me a little<br>later on because often people ask what's<br>the difference between oral health<br>dental technology and dental surgery but<br>this uh particular qualification does um<br>indeed allow you to work uh in New<br>Zealand in fact there's a high demand<br>for uh uh graduates in this space as<br>well of our New Zealand's green list as<br>such now interestingly with the Bachelor<br>of dental technology you can actually<br>apply directly from high school you do<br>not need to do Health Sciences first<br>year however you can come through that<br>option as an alternative but it is<br>possible for you to apply directly from<br>school to The Bachelor of dental<br>technology it has limited places<br>so there is a selection process uh and<br>that would of course be based on your uh<br>High School grades um at that point uh<br>and in terms of those limited places<br>There's no distinction between domestic<br>and international students in terms of<br>um places in that regard we also have a<br>bachelor of oral health uh so uh more<br>related to the hygiene and oral health<br>elements um that support and complement<br>the world of Dentistry so again three<br>years and again also it's possible to<br>apply directly as a high school lever<br>into this particular qualification you<br>do not have to do Health Science first<br>year though that is an option uh if you<br>uh potentially as well uh so again it's<br>on our green list in New Zealand it's a<br>high demand area very good employment<br>opportunities but it is a competitive<br>entry into the program uh directly from<br>high school as there are limited<br>places all right moving<br>on so The Bachelor of medical laboratory<br>science I almost like to say these are<br>the detectives within the hospital so um<br>um medical laboratory scientists is<br>basically as it says there there is a<br>shortage of them worldwide so once again<br>they are on New Zealand's green list or<br>demand in New Zealand this is a<br>four-year full-time study program so<br>first year Health Sciences first year<br>then another three years and you become<br>registered with the New Zealand medical<br>Sciences Council straight after<br>graduation so your first two to three<br>years of the program will be made up of<br>lectures papers uh working in the<br>laboratory or doing lab um and then your<br>fourth year it's placement within the<br>hospital system uh basically you need to<br>pass all your health science first your<br>papers at first attempt and the minimum<br>average is<br>65% International students compete with<br>International students for a place into<br>the Bachelor of medical laboratory<br>science right at Oto we call the<br>Bachelor of medicine and Bachelor of<br>surgery or you come out with an<br>mbchb this is six years at University<br>your first year is Health Sciences first<br>year and then if you get into the<br>medicine and surgery program it's<br>another five years at the University of<br>otaro<br>within the five years it does include<br>one year of internship which is your<br>final year and you will upon graduating<br>can then register with the medical<br>Council of New<br>Zealand so your first two years when you<br>get into the school of medicine are um<br>integrated courses of course based<br>around the body system um I think K will<br>tell you a little bit more about that uh<br>there will also be the chance to um dis<br>sector a civa with other students and<br>gross anatomy and then it's your fourth<br>and fifth year where you're starting to<br>in the holidays and get more clinical<br>work within the hospitals um Oto<br>training hospitals of denan even Christ<br>Church Wellington leading into that<br>final year of internship now you need to<br>pass all your health science first year<br>papers at the first attempt and it's a<br>minimum of 70% in each paper<br>International students will compete with<br>other International students I might<br>just remind everyone too that there is<br>no sat we always get a lot of SATs and<br>as you can see there's no interview as<br>well so it's all based on that basically<br>minimum of lease your GPA within your<br>health science first year papers is<br>there anything I've missed Fiona the UK<br>and the UK<br>right great so that's the the big ticket<br>one I'm sure for many people<br>Pharmacy Pharmacy so The Bachelor of<br>Pharmacy is a 4-year program once again<br>health science is first year and then<br>another three years after that it also<br>includes a one year of internship after<br>graduation to become registered with the<br>pharmacy Council of New Zealand so um<br>basically it's uh it's different to the<br>other uh programs where in your three<br>years uh you have integrated courses<br>which means that throughout the year<br>you've got um workshops you've got skill<br>workshops uh you're having placements<br>from year three onwards um basically<br>it's it as it says there it's you're<br>being taught Cutting Edge curriculum um<br>and very the lab times very Hands-On and<br>real life experience and they've got<br>their own Pharmacy Clinic you'll even<br>get um to have uh patients that come<br>into the Oto Pharmacy Clinic where you<br>can actually talk to them about their<br>medicines um to get into Pharmacy it's a<br>pass in all Health Science first year<br>papers at first attempt and normally<br>with a minimum average of 65<br>International students compete with<br>International<br>students The Bachelor of physiotherapy<br>once again light Pharmacy is a four-year<br>program Health Science first year plus<br>three years once you get in and it's R<br>you at when you graduate pardon you will<br>get registration with the New Zealand<br>physiotherapy board right after<br>graduation So within the Bachelor of<br>physiotherapy there is placement from<br>year two and um basically you'll be you<br>can have placement in uh one of the<br>schools in either denan Christ Church or<br>Wellington um we have our own Oto uh<br>physiotherapy Clinic too which you'll<br>have patients actually coming in um as<br>well as working also in the hospital<br>sector uh pass in all Health Science<br>first year papers at first attempt<br>normally with a minimum average of 65%<br>International students will compete with<br>International students for a<br>place now not everyone is cut out to be<br>dealing with patients face to face and<br>as such there's a whole breadth of other<br>excellent health science related degrees<br>that allow you to be a part of the<br>health sector and especially a part of<br>the discovery research and development<br>of uh of of of things that help us in<br>our health um in our daily lives as well<br>so we wanted to make sure you're aware<br>of other options which include our<br>fantastic Bachelor of pharmaceutical<br>science now this is the only degree of<br>its kind in New Zealand and this is<br>really geared up for those of you<br>seeking a kind of an all-encompassing<br>degree to look at the discovery design<br>and development of and formulation and<br>use of drugs and of course<br>pharmaceutical science or the<br>pharmaceutical industry is global it's<br>uh ever expanding and hot on demand so<br>this is a wonderful way in within a<br>three-year bachelor degree to achieve a<br>qualification that can certainly take<br>your places uh it's very lab based uh<br>very handson and it's great for students<br>with interest in science and technology<br>and who do have a passion for medicine<br>or interest in how to prevent and treat<br>diseases uh but this really is a<br>terrific program uh and again one of its<br>kind and not only does it focus on or<br>incorporate sort of Western Med Western<br>practices it does also bring in a unique<br>perspective of our own uh rongo Mai uh<br>perspectives and toward um treatment and<br>and consideration of medicines which<br>makes it extra special so uh again it is<br>a three-year program and there is uh<br>it's possible to directly apply into the<br>Bachelor of pharmaceutical Sciences<br>directly from high school it's not uh a<br>limit of places uh but you can also<br>consider taking uh the Health Sciences<br>first year program with fion initially<br>and then moving into this direction as<br>an alternative way uh but certainly hot<br>demand in the pharmaceutical industry in<br>fact Cosmetics industry uh Regulatory<br>Affairs uh pharmaceutical sales uh among<br>other areas so wonderful degree program<br>the other favorite of mine is in fact<br>our Bachelor of biomedical sciences and<br>biomedical science at ataro is<br>exceptionally strong this is for those<br>of you who are very interested in<br>looking at the causes and diagnosis and<br>remedies of human diseases so kind of in<br>behind discovering identifying and<br>pinpointing and finding<br>Solutions uh and I think this this is a<br>very appealing option for those of those<br>of you who may think you want to be a<br>doctor but maybe patient patient contact<br>is maybe not your thing um so again it<br>is a threeyear<br>program and there are a couple of ways<br>to enter into this you can enter<br>directly as a um High School lever with<br>University entrance uh and you would<br>apply for what we call our biomedical<br>Sciences first year a little bit like<br>our Health Sciences first year but a<br>little bit more targeted specifically<br>for the biomedical science degree and<br>that's a great mapped out uh series of<br>courses in your first year and then you<br>progress into your second and third year<br>in which you can choose to specialize in<br>one of the six uh Majors indicated here<br>on the slide so whether that's drugs and<br>human health or infection and Immunity<br>for instance nutrition and um metabolism<br>and human health reproduction genetics<br>and development among others there so<br>again three years uh um and and great<br>career prospects from this particular<br>degree as<br>well righto now I think it's fair to say<br>that degree can actually really take you<br>places yeah we're incredibly proud that<br>uh we've got that's a photo of Rihanna<br>um bani she's was uh Saudi Arabia's<br>first female astronaut to go to the<br>International Space Station and she was<br>an Notaro graduate so uh she did uh<br>Bachelor of biomed Sciences as an<br>undergrad and then went on to do<br>postgrad in um<br>aeroscience all right now we also have<br>the Bachelor of Health Sciences and this<br>one sometimes trips people up because<br>the name is similar to health Sciences<br>first year but essentially The Bachelor<br>of Health Sciences is a three-year<br>public health degree more or less um so<br>this is focusing on prevention uh and<br>promotion of Health in our communities<br>there are opportunities to specialize uh<br>in Mari or Pacific or Global Health but<br>what's really exciting about atago's<br>Bachelor of Public Health or Bachelor of<br>Health Sciences is indeed the caliber of<br>the epidemiologists and the researchers<br>who are part of this program indeed they<br>were very much uh informing our<br>government in terms of um covid response<br>back when in those days uh and really<br>are leading in a number of fascinating<br>areas uh and and support of community<br>and public health so this is a very<br>strong program uh and attractive for<br>many students um and of course it leads<br>to a variety of careers whether that's<br>uh locally in your community but or<br>government advising uh even looking at<br>the World Health Organization for<br>instance so there's a lot of<br>opportunities there<br>it is a three-year degree you can enter<br>directly from high school with your<br>University entrance um and uh yeah<br>another great program so lastly The<br>Bachelor of Science which of course has<br>many many many different Majors or<br>specializations but a number of those<br>are very much health science related so<br>it's possible to do a three-year<br>Bachelor of Science focused in anatomy<br>for instance or genetics or microbiology<br>and other examples as indicated on the<br>slide furthermore when you take a<br>Bachelor of Science with a major in one<br>of these health related areas it's<br>actually possible to combine that with a<br>minor and something else that might take<br>your fancy for instance something from<br>Commerce business uh or the Arts so this<br>is a weit more of a flexible program um<br>but again fantastic research fantastic<br>academics and a really strong degree to<br>take you in a variety of uh directions<br>depending on your particular passion a<br>lot of students use this um if they<br>don't get into their health science<br>professional programs they'll then go on<br>into seconde Bachelor of Science and<br>some of these health related majors and<br>uh there is the opportunity to then if<br>um go uh apply as a graduate once you've<br>completed a BSC uh back into some of the<br>professional health science programs as<br>The Graduate entry category but for say<br>for example medicine your Bachelor must<br>be from a New Zealand<br>University now a couple of quick<br>questions just in regards to some of the<br>program programs we've talked about and<br>Fiona I'm going to Loop you in here if I<br>may but do you mind just summarizing for<br>us the difference between Health<br>Sciences first year and a bachelor of<br>Health Sciences so the health science<br>first year we talked about how there<br>were seven compulsory papers that you<br>need to take in that program whereas The<br>Bachelor of Health Science actually<br>there's three papers from the health<br>side first year group of papers that you<br>must take but you've got more<br>flexibility um with the Bachelor of<br>Health Science to pick other papers um<br>related to that degree and indeed if<br>your if your total ambition is to get<br>into a professional health program you<br>have to take Health Science first year<br>yeah now what about health science's<br>first year versus biomedical Sciences<br>first year excellent question but again<br>there is overlap so again Health side<br>first year seven compulsory papers for<br>the biomedical Sciences first year you<br>need to take um five of those papers so<br>five of The Seven health s first papers<br>you don't have to do the physics paper<br>or the population Health paper and it<br>means that you can again pick up other<br>papers that are more related to that<br>breadth of biomedical Sciences excellent<br>now what if you already have a degree uh<br>or a registration from overseas in the<br>Health Arena what are our options then<br>okay so if you've got a degree it's like<br>Victoria mentioned before if you're<br>aiming for say medicine or dentistry in<br>Europe already have a degree in<br>um you might need to help me here um as<br>as you said it's a different category so<br>you can come in as a graduate um into or<br>you can come in through the alternative<br>Pathway to health professional programs<br>I think the alternative is probably more<br>appro basically for Health Sciences<br>first year you have to be very careful<br>that if they'll look and see if you've<br>actually got a degree from overseas and<br>for a lot of students they'll be<br>declined into Health Sciences first year<br>because it is a year to of of<br>competition and it's an unfair Advantage<br>if you've already done the equivalent of<br>um the health science first year papers<br>so if you already have a degree you<br>would not be able to get into Health<br>Science first year for you but um there<br>are graduate categories and alternative<br>categories please go onto our website<br>for more information and actually<br>another point on that is if you are a<br>school lever and you do wish to study<br>Health Science first year but you've got<br>a gap perhaps a half a year before our<br>next cycle you you're not allowed to do<br>any University level study in any of the<br>yeah the important thing is it can't it'<br>be fine to do an Arts subject but you<br>can't do papers that would overlap with<br>the material in our health science first<br>year papers and it's the same for the<br>degree if you've done an arts degree you<br>we might would probably let you into to<br>Health Science first year it's more if<br>you've done say a chemistry degree or a<br>physics or<br>Anatomy then you've you've got an<br>advantage as Victoria said and and we uh<br>we want to keep things Fair across the<br>coh right we're just going to switch<br>briefly into the topic of scholarships<br>for international students in relation<br>to any of these health science programs<br>and this is how it works so atago has<br>the vice Chancellor's scholarship for<br>international students uh this is<br>applicable for new full degree Bachelor<br>students commencing with us next year or<br>2026 it's valued at $1,000 New Zealand<br>off the tuition of your first year of<br>study and these are unlimited so<br>essentially if you are an international<br>student who will be joining us for um a<br>degree program whether that's commencing<br>healthi first year and moving through or<br>directly into for instance Bachelor of<br>pharmaceutical Sciences uh then you will<br>be considered for the vice Chancellor<br>international student scholarship in<br>terms of applying it's super<br>straightforward when you make your uh<br>application for admission uh there will<br>be a moment where you are asked to<br>question would you like to be considered<br>for an International Scholarship and you<br>would select yes and that's the<br>application for that part done next up<br>we uh have the University of atago<br>Global scholarships and these are um<br>available to students from particular<br>citizenship who will be commencing a new<br>bachelor degree program with us in 25 or<br>26 now the current eligible countries<br>for this particular scholarship uh China<br>India Indonesia Malaysia Singapore South<br>Korea Thailand and Vietnam the value of<br>this scholarship is<br>$155,000 again it's taken off the um<br>first year of your tuition uh and again<br>there are unlimited offers for this<br>particular scholarship uh again the key<br>to apply is when you get that question<br>would you like to be considered for an<br>International Scholarship you select yes<br>now just to point out it's not possible<br>to have a vice Chancellor scholarship<br>and a global essentially if you're from<br>one of the countries listed here on this<br>slide you would be awarded a global uh<br>if you're not you would be awarded an a<br>vice Chancellor scholarship and of<br>course that's subject to being in line<br>with the regulations and formal rules<br>for the scholarship but effectively if<br>you're going to be joining us for a uh<br>new bachelor degree program you are new<br>and starting a three-year Bachelor at<br>minimum with us you would be considered<br>for that now we're very excited to<br>introduce you to our uh International<br>academic Excellence scholarship this is<br>new uh for students uh commencing in 25<br>and this is an opportunity for for us to<br>recognize uh top talent of students who<br>have been studying in an overseas uh<br>school and who will be coming again for<br>a full Bachelor with us and the value of<br>this scholarship is actually up to $<br>35,000 New Zealand Dollars which<br>consists of 20 approximately 20,000 New<br>Zealand dollars to cover your first year<br>of accommodation uh followed by second<br>year a tuition uh scholarship and a<br>third-year tuition scholarship now this<br>is a competitive selection so your<br>grades um and any other related<br>information to that will be considered<br>by a panel uh and it is actually<br>possible to have either a vice<br>Chancellor International Scholarship or<br>a global scholarship plus this academic<br>Excellence scholarship meaning you have<br>a potential total value of up to $50,000<br>New Zealand dollars depending on um the<br>particular citizenship in this occasion<br>so how do apply for this one well what<br>will happen is if you receive an offer<br>off of place to the university and you<br>are offered uh a vice Chancellor or a<br>global scholarship and you accept that<br>then you will be invited to apply for<br>the international academic Excellence<br>scholarship and for that there's a small<br>application form to complete and then<br>you will be considered for that one now<br>what is high achieving we often get<br>asked that typically we're looking at<br>the top 1 to 5% of a of achievers of all<br>applicants and the round um but kind of<br>more informally we'd be expecting a<br>minimum GPA of at least 80% or an A<br>minus to be kind of in the in the realms<br>for that<br>area in case um uh actually I'm not sure<br>if this one applies in this case it can<br>do uh we do have uh an additional<br>scholarship International partnership<br>scholarship for some of our students who<br>are studying at a partner University and<br>who will be articulating and joining<br>into one of our degree programs uh<br>whereby they will take at least four<br>semesters of study or two years with us<br>and um these students will be considered<br>for the international partnership<br>scholarship there is a selection for<br>that that is valued at<br>$10,000 of<br>tuition in case you are a New Zealand<br>based international student currently in<br>a New Zealand high school right now you<br>are able to be considered for<br>scholarships alongside your domestic<br>peers by applying for the undergraduate<br>entrance scholarships and this has a<br>very specific application period because<br>you're in New Zealand together with your<br>uh student friends at a New Zealand high<br>school so you can only apply actively<br>for these between July and mid August<br>and again the range of value is from<br>10,000 up to<br>45,000 um and uh so that's handy to know<br>but if you are a New Zealand student<br>international student you must apply in<br>that specific New Zealand University<br>entrance scholarship period in July to<br>August lastly some of you might be<br>looking a little bit further ahead and<br>it's great to know the New Zealand<br>government has a very generous monari<br>New Zealand scholarship program this is<br>a full scholarship covering all costs<br>and of course there are eligible<br>countries and eligible or priority<br>subject themes so it's worth you having<br>a look at the manari website to<br>understand those options there is<br>usually only one application cycle each<br>year held from the in the month of<br>February four studies typically the<br>following<br>February and lastly in case you don't<br>quite meet our University entrance<br>requir ments and need or would like to<br>take our foundation studies program for<br>instance we do have the University of<br>atago pathway scholarship and uh for<br>that there is a minimum value of $5,000<br>New Zealand dos which you can be<br>considered for and you need to make an<br>active application using a PDF form for<br>that<br>one right I'm conscious of the time<br>we're going to zip through the<br>application process um here are some key<br>dates you can apply right now to join us<br>for Health Sciences first year next year<br>or and any of their other excellent<br>health professional or health um uh<br>health related bachelor degree programs<br>so the application period is open from<br>the 1st of May to the 15th of May for<br>Health Sciences first year biomedical<br>Sciences first year the Bachelor of<br>Health Sciences the public health one uh<br>or The Bachelor of Science uh likewise<br>for The Bachelor of pharmaceutical<br>science<br>and I feel like we're missing in one but<br>I can't quite remember however what is<br>important to note is there is a specific<br>application period for our Bachelor of<br>oral health and The Bachelor of dental<br>technology those particular two programs<br>don't open until the 1st of August and<br>the deadline is the 15th of September so<br>it's important to note those special<br>application<br>deadlines so just a reminder as we<br>briefly commented on earlier if you are<br>successful coming into Health Sciences<br>first year you won't apply for the<br>professional health program until you<br>are in that Health Science first year<br>program it's during that year and of<br>course leading up to that moment there's<br>a lot of information and support so you<br>can be sure of your options and work<br>through all of that but you cannot apply<br>directly for medicine or Dentistry or<br>physiotherapy Etc you need to go for<br>heai first year<br>first righty ho very briefly scan the QR<br>uh there but check the entry<br>requirements you need to apply online<br>through our evision application portal<br>if you're hoping to do a professional<br>program you need to choose Health<br>Sciences first year that is the name of<br>the program you're applying for and you<br>need to submit that application there is<br>only one intake each year for Health<br>Sciences first year there's only one<br>intake each year for The Bachelor of<br>dental technology and there's only one<br>intake for The Bachelor of oral health<br>um we have a February intake for our<br>foundation study certificate as well as<br>a June intake yes um and you can apply<br>for bio The Bachelor of biomedical<br>Sciences the first year in either<br>semester one or semester 2 and a<br>reminder that in New Zealand semester 1<br>or the start of our Academic Year is in<br>summer in February whereas our second<br>intake is in July which is kind of<br>winry righty ho life in the classroom I<br>think we're going to cut straight<br>through to our students to share this<br>information because obviously there will<br>be a combination of lectures and<br>tutorials laboratory sessions clinical<br>placement ments uh and access to a<br>variety of other options and we're going<br>to skip through accommodation at this<br>moment in time I'm sorry we're going to<br>jump to our students to share more about<br>all of this um so we're going to open up<br>the floor and now be joined by Eric who<br>is a real live international<br>student so um H guys my name is Eric s i<br>study Bachelor of dental surgery at the<br>University of ofo I come from South<br>Korea and I'm the class representative<br>of my Dentistry class and I I take a lot<br>of leadership positions this year and<br>I'm also the international student<br>ambassador here which is the reason why<br>I'm talking about my study Journey at<br>Vaga yeah so um my study Journey ATA<br>started with Health Sciences first year<br>and I applied to many different um<br>health professional programs such as<br>medicine Dentistry Pharmacy<br>Physiotherapy and I chose Dentistry<br>because that's the degree that I've been<br>wanting to pursue and University OFA is<br>known for its um world class education<br>especially faculty of Dentistry is<br>really highly ranked and the building<br>and facilities are both like really<br>modern and which can offer you one of<br>the best dental education in the world<br>and the campus itself is really<br>beautiful also as you can see in the<br>photo a typical day in my life um I have<br>two to three lectures a day and one to<br>two laps a day um Dentistry is a really<br>Hands-On degree which means we have a<br>lot of labs so if you prefer like um<br>practical learning sessions over just<br>like sitting down and memorizing lecture<br>sites then Dentistry might be the one<br>for you and um outside of um studies I<br>do tutoring I I tutor some high school<br>students and I do um a lot of<br>extracurricular activities such as those<br>leadership committee activities and some<br>church commitments and I and during the<br>night time I usually study at the<br>library because um my friends also study<br>at the library and I go to library not<br>just to study but also to<br>socialize yeah and some tips for um<br>academic success I recommend you guys to<br>use um planners and apps to keep track<br>with assignments and deadlines and<br>actively participating into lectures and<br>discussion study groups is really<br>important because um it's scientifically<br>proven that active Learners retain a lot<br>more information than passive learners<br>and for smooth transition to University<br>live um I recommend you guys to join a<br>lot of clubs and societies to meet new<br>people and build a support network and<br>as you can see in the slide that's the<br>that's the logo of OTA University Korean<br>Students Association which is the club<br>that I'm running so if you guys don't<br>know what club to join feel free to join<br>this club yeah and and also there's<br>heaps of resources available for you<br>guys so I recommend you to um make the<br>most out of it yeah that's it for me<br>excellent Eric thank you so much and may<br>I ask what have you enjoyed the most so<br>far out of Health Sciences first year<br>and Dentistry so far what is what's like<br>a highlight for you highlight so um we<br>have this lab called simulation clinic<br>and Dentistry it's basically like we<br>have the whole like Dentistry set up in<br>in the lab and like it's really fun to<br>work on those like model te and stuff<br>yeah that's my favorite part of<br>Dentistry yeah awesome thank you Eric<br>now we're going to switch over to Kiana<br>Kayana<br>sorry K my name is k and I come from<br>India and I'm a second year medical<br>student here at the University of aago I<br>am an international student uh<br>Ambassador and the residential officer<br>for theago international Student<br>Association um so my reason for coming<br>to aago I mean um M and Vic have already<br>covered it up but it's like a world<br>rounded University and it take all my<br>checkboxes like we have like topnotch<br>education here we've got amazing<br>lectures and professors for our lectures<br>and um everything's at a short walking<br>distance so the location is pretty good<br>and um personally I enjoy like um<br>experiencing four different Weathers in<br>the same day so so that's pretty good<br>and uh we have um ample of like events<br>happening around the campus so it's<br>pretty uh Lively and um talking about<br>student support there's tons of support<br>available for uh student students<br>especially International students so<br>that you're like never like like feel<br>alone and finally I'd like to say um<br>it's the people and like the connections<br>that you make here that make the entire<br>um experience like a lot more like<br>wholesome and just worth it yeah that's<br>great so what a usual dat looks like so<br>I usually get breakfast at my<br>Residential College that has all like<br>meals prepared for me like uh breakfast<br>lunch and dinners and following uh that<br>I usually go to my lectures so we<br>usually have uh 10 lectures a week<br>alongside four to five Labs which are<br>very Hands-On and um after that I just<br>go for like a quick study session at my<br>favorite um study spot at the campus<br>it's really pretty if you just go check<br>that out and um sorry I I one slide too<br>many sorry all right um so tell just for<br>coming sorry I'm Ming you around<br>now I'll go back this<br>yeah so yeah so top tips about coming to<br>the university um it's a bit it's a new<br>city or a new country and it's okay to<br>feel overwhelmed but you have ample of<br>support available here and so you just<br>need to take the first step to like come<br>out of your comfort zone and you will<br>just find people like like-minded people<br>and it'll be okay so yeah just also like<br>make sure to like pack for all Bs and um<br>as I said before D is pretty beginner<br>friendly like everything on the campus<br>so yeah just everything will be okay<br>yeah fantastic thank you for sharing<br>your story I'm sorry about my slid<br>driving just just quickly because we we<br>did we're running out of time and we<br>didn't really get to focus on the<br>colleges just just explain to the<br>audience what you do in the evenings how<br>the colleges support you in Health<br>Sciences first year oh yeah so most of<br>the colleges have uh tutorials uh based<br>on like what papers you're studying so<br>in case in my case I'm at St Margaret's<br>college and we usually have uh tutorials<br>for uh people um setting the same papers<br>so the college just like arranges tutors<br>to come in and we have like um like it's<br>like a smaller a ratio of the student to<br>the tutor yeah so that's pretty helpful<br>for all the first year students yeah so<br>when we talk about colleges we're<br>talking about residential colleges um<br>hostile accommodation that's right<br>um excellent and cayana if I'm not<br>mistaken I saw something on one of your<br>slides here this is why I got so<br>distracted because I saw you have got<br>the pinky Bluey in the sky um yeah I'd<br>like I'd love to mention that we<br>recently saw like the auroras yeah yeah<br>in the month of May so that's that's<br>amazing like that's an amazing sport set<br>yeah and if I'm also not mistaken you<br>were once sitting on the other side of<br>this watching this webinar that is true<br>I attended the 2022 webinar just like<br>any other prospective student and I<br>found it pretty um helpful so yeah I'm<br>sitting here on the opposite side<br>now well thank you Eric and uh cayana<br>for sharing your experience it's<br>exciting for you to to know that it's<br>possible you can do Health s first year<br>and you can get into the professional<br>programs and and do very well so I think<br>we're now ready to move into some uh<br>questions and answers that have popped<br>up during um<br>um presentation and we yes we did skip<br>over accommodation today just due to<br>timing but we can always come back to<br>that later we can so please put your uh<br>questions into the Q&amp;A we do have staff<br>behind the scenes that are answering<br>those for you but um just uh pulling out<br>some of the most common themes that have<br>been running through the hour is uh the<br>first one is what was the health science<br>first year grade cut off this year for<br>students<br>me um so each year there there is a<br>different cut off it really depends on<br>the cohort but generally it is high<br>particularly for medicine whether you're<br>a domestic or an international student<br>and we really just encourage all the<br>students to do the best that they can<br>and really engage with the material in<br>the papers and do do your best um but<br>yes it is very competitive to get into<br>both medicine and indstry but on the<br>other hand we have amazing students and<br>I'm sure that many of you fit into that<br>category who come here and do really<br>really well and get into the program<br>that they<br>want Eric you got into the The Bachelor<br>of dental surgery program um did you<br>find it competitive or is there any<br>advice for students that you can kind of<br>give to students yeah so um obviously<br>it's Dentistry it cannot be easy to get<br>in it is competitive but but um I just<br>wanted to point out that like it's it's<br>not like if you put in the work if you<br>like if you study consistently if you<br>like keep engaged in studying and stuff<br>then yeah you're going to be able to<br>make it into Bal dental surgery yeah do<br>you have any advice on how students can<br>maximize their chances it's like being<br>um consecutive like being consistent<br>with your studies and just like not<br>letting like this moment effect just<br>like snowball you know like things just<br>keep getting added up just like pre like<br>make sure not to like go to that stage<br>and just be on the top of things yeah I<br>always say to advice don't get a<br>part-time job and Health Sciences F year<br>you know Focus this is your year to<br>focus and get in and um the the the<br>mother in me says No boy friends or<br>girlfriends you're do have side J you<br>just focus on getting into that course<br>and then canical quality of lash<br>okay here's another question U well<br>actually I just want to add to that<br>because I think Fiona makes well<br>everyone's made a very good point But<br>ultimately it's about showing up and um<br>and being present for the learning and<br>engaging isn't it absolutely this isn't<br>a time to skip a lecture and watch a<br>recording little<br>snowball exactly um we've got another<br>question here how many Health Science<br>first year International students are<br>there on an average every year that's a<br>good question Victoria that fluctuates a<br>little bit um and actually I'm not sure<br>if you can recall in your year your<br>year I think I was around I say I'm not<br>sure<br>it 100 to 150 is where I'm my numbers<br>sit in my head um so that's that but I<br>think another natural thing that happens<br>for students if I'm not mistaken during<br>Health Sciences first year is and this<br>is for domestic and international that<br>there comes a point where some students<br>quite early on Realize actually yeah I'm<br>actually really interested in this which<br>leads me into a Bachelor of Science and<br>genetics for instance or I'm more<br>interested in the biomedical science<br>side of it behind the scenes so so so<br>there's sort of a natural movement<br>within that cohort right off the bat or<br>during that year yeah definitely every<br>year we have a number of students who<br>who actually decide Health Science F and<br>for and they might even move into a<br>Bachelor of Science in the first couple<br>of weeks because theyve realized it's<br>not for them and they can continue to do<br>that through the year as they learning<br>more um having gaining more experience<br>in the different subject areas and<br>thinking about what those professions<br>will all like and I think you also have<br>like a career almost like a career fear<br>don't you where all the Departments come<br>together and students can do that<br>oneon-one in May each year we invite um<br>all the our so first year students to<br>come into um actually the building that<br>we're in now um and we have all the<br>professional programs um for the for the<br>Health Sciences come in and all the<br>health s students we had four hours it<br>was completely packed the whole time<br>with students coming in talking to the<br>students who were already in medicine<br>and Dentistry Med lab site to understand<br>what the programs uh what all of the<br>programs are like and we had quite a few<br>students saying oh I didn't really<br>understand you know what dental<br>technology was or um you'd really do as<br>a pharmacist and that's very very<br>helpful for students because we also<br>recommend that um you can actually apply<br>for all of those programs um so to leave<br>your options open
