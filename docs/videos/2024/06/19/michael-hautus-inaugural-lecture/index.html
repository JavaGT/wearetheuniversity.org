As the director of the Psychophysics Laboratory at the University of Aucklandâ€™s School of Psychology, he focuses on sensory and perceptual systems research and modelling detection and discrimination judgments. Michael has also researched sensory evaluation, auditory neuroscience, pain, memory, and decision science. His most-valued works include the 3rd edition of Detection Theory: A User's Guide and the specialised software SDT Assistant, which enables broader implementation of the techniques of signal detection theory. This inaugural lecture will elucidate key aspects of SDT while chronicling the evolution of Michael's scholarly pursuits. Audience members will gain insights into the past, present, and future trajectories of SDT and the shifting focus of his research career. The talk highlights the enduring relevance of SDT and its pivotal role in advancing our understanding of perception, decision-making, and quantitative psychology.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

our<br>traditional mway uh into the space and<br>uh for you m at this time<br>and just what a blessing it is uh for us<br>all to come in for this evening uh to<br>occasion so everybody that is gathered<br>here Este guests family members past<br>friends and I heard like 20 years ago<br>some as well and 22 years as well those<br>that have come here today uh welcome<br>welcome particularly those uh<br>uh that have you know come to the space<br>uh as we do in these traditional<br>welcomes as well we we finish off with a<br>W and don't worry Foo it's a very easy W<br>that you can all sing together it's<br>called Tia so if we could all be<br>twice<br>for<br>for<br>thank you tyi Koto um I'm John hosking<br>Dean of science it's my pleasure to<br>welcome you to W Pap matal the<br>University of Oakland and the inaugural<br>lecture of Professor Michael<br>hus Michael works in the era of<br>psychophysics which sounds like a<br>crossover episode between Friday the<br>13th and Doctor<br>Who but it is in fact the study of how<br>physical stimuli becomes subjective<br>psychologic iCal perceptions how we see<br>the world really he specializes in the<br>application of single signal detection<br>Theory or stt I was saying to Michael<br>before that um I better not confuse that<br>with stts which is something else<br>entirely so applies stts to the study of<br>psychophysics stt enables Quant<br>quantifying ability independently of<br>performance by separating sensitivity<br>from response bias used as and is used<br>in a very broad range of applications in<br>addition to<br>psychophysics Michael did his PhD here<br>in Oakland working with John win<br>graduating in<br>1993 joined the lecturing staff of the<br>then Department of psychology in<br>1999 working his way through the ranks<br>to his recent promotion to Professor<br>which we're celebrating tonight his work<br>with stdt started with uh his PhD has<br>continued and evolve since then<br>including its application quantitative<br>psychology memory sensory evaluation<br>pain auditory Neuroscience mathematical<br>modeling and decision science he's one<br>of the leading authorities in this area<br>and has recently published detection<br>Theory a users guide Third Edition as<br>author of stt assistant a software<br>package widely used in stdt<br>work one of his more intriguing recent<br>papers questions whether the touted most<br>relaxing song in the world weightless is<br>in fact that<br>relaxing tonight Michael is going to<br>tell us all about stdt and it's after<br>adaptation to psychophysics Michael the<br>yours K Ora everyone thank you for<br>coming I noticed something's actually<br>happening on my presentation already<br>which shouldn't be happen and that is it<br>suddenly inserted animations on<br>everything which wasn't there so bear<br>with me as I work my way through that<br>okay<br>so what we're going to talk about today<br>is um psychophysics then and now and the<br>contents of what I'm going to talk about<br>are essentially rambling I'm going to<br>ramble across a whole bunch of different<br>topics I'm going to ramble on about the<br>history of psychophysics about how just<br>there me about signal detection Theory<br>which is my primary in interest um about<br>some of my research and just a tast of<br>that and the reason for just the taster<br>is I want to bring in my colleagues that<br>I've done research with and acknowledge<br>the work that they've done with<br>me then I'm going to go to something<br>that's a little bit more serious a<br>crisis in the measurement theory and<br>practice currently which basically says<br>we're at a point where everything looks<br>a little bit less um Ro y than it may<br>seem to people in terms of measurement<br>Theory and then what am I going to do<br>from now on now that I'm a<br>professor and then I'm going to sort of<br>give a little bit of advice not really<br>I'm going to tell you what my pathway<br>was going through an academic career<br>okay so a little bit of history and a<br>little bit about the scope of my talk<br>here we have three people from the<br>distant past these people<br>Ernest Faber William V and Gustav ficner<br>are often considered forefathers<br>founding fathers of experimental<br>psychology this is where psychology as<br>we know it today really started back in<br>the 1850s<br>1860s and for my area of Psych<br>psychology psychophysics um that's<br>essentially what they were doing back<br>then so most people who have done like<br>stage one psychology will have come<br>across hopefully these three folk and<br>philam v um is generally recognized the<br>starting the very first psychology<br>laboratory there ever was so it all<br>started there and it was all about<br>psychophysics and then Ernest vber came<br>along he actually came along earlier uh<br>but he didn't have a laboratory uh and<br>he came up with one of the famous great<br>laws of psychology that there is<br>V's law named after<br>himself and you'd Le that in stage one<br>well you should and then there's Gustav<br>Fetner who was a contemporary of VOR in<br>fact they had the same supervisor and um<br>fer well he had his own law that you<br>should also learn and I'll mention a bit<br>later but otherwise he's pretty much<br>forgotten and didn't get the sort of<br>credit that he should have so he's the<br>hero tonight and what I'm going to talk<br>about we're going to find out why he's<br>the hero as we<br>progress so the last slide said local<br>psychophysics and okay so why do you<br>have loc psychophysics because there's<br>another thing called Global<br>psychophysics local local psychophysics<br>is about confusable stimul it's stimul<br>that are very similar stimuli that are<br>very small where if you try to make<br>decisions about them you're likely to<br>get those decisions wrong some of the<br>time in fact you're guaranteed too<br>because it's impossible to get the<br>answers right all the time the<br>confusable stimul and they relate to<br>this whole area called detection Theory<br>or signal detection Theory so that's<br>what I do and then there's this other<br>side over there the global psychophysics<br>it's about how big your perception of<br>stimul is here's a glass of water that<br>contains some cordial here's another<br>glass that contains more cordial how<br>many times stronger is the second one<br>than the first one so it's looking at<br>the distance psychological distance<br>between things that are not confusable<br>at all and the person who did the most<br>work in this area was SS<br>Stevens and he came up with another law<br>which is written down there it's called<br>Steven's law surprisingly and it shows<br>the relationship between the strength of<br>stimuli and the strength of<br>perception now another thing I should<br>have said about my talk is we don't care<br>about the details so you see an equation<br>just look at it and say oh yeah okay<br>it's the meaning that's important it's<br>what's behind it and the progression of<br>ideas okay so we' got confusable stimuli<br>and what we really want to do is<br>separate out and people's decisions<br>about those stimuli a thing called<br>capacity if you like which is like how<br>well they could potentially do what the<br>system their system their neural system<br>whichever system you're talking about<br>can do as compared to their performance<br>which is what you get after they've<br>given a<br>response so two slightly different<br>things that we will come across and that<br>second one is not very useful and it<br>relates to a thing called response<br>bias okay so moving on from there we on<br>the rambles we're going to who am I<br>and okay<br>so clearly not me but yes I did go into<br>a lab and someone said oh down there's<br>one of my students why don't you go down<br>and meet them so I went and and said hi<br>and the student comes up to me and says<br>are you Michael<br>hows cuz they see my my software and of<br>course on my software I've got this<br>little icon on it there's an icon of<br>gusta fitner and they were expecting to<br>see gusta fitner come in and talk to<br>them<br>fitner but seriously who am I and I<br>think there's two ways to look at that<br>one is to look at the academic Heritage<br>that I have and the other is to look at<br>The Crucible in which I was born the<br>family heritage so I'm going to have a<br>quick chat about both of those which we<br>give you a better idea of um me in two<br>different ways so here we have a family<br>tree this is an academic family tree and<br>on so we can see here's me down here my<br>supervisor was John win who I'll mention<br>a little bit more about later but if we<br>go back through the supervisor of my<br>supervisor etc etc all the way back<br>through we can come up to Stanley Smith<br>Stevens who I mentioned with stev power<br>law was his thing there was a major<br>turning point in quantification of a<br>large part of psychology then we go back<br>to rather well-known names and then we<br>go back to V that's where the first lab<br>started and that was in<br>1870 I think it was and we keep going<br>back and we get to vber on the direct<br>line and then V's supervisor was also<br>fer supervisor so those two came out of<br>the same same school the liik university<br>and um had the same supervisor who<br>surprisingly is not very famous at all<br>but was um a physician of some<br>description okay<br>so how do I end up in psychophysics well<br>I ended up in psychophysics because John<br>uran was in psychophysics and I was<br>excited about what he was doing he ended<br>up in psychophysics because of his<br>supervisor and this goes back and back<br>and back further and further to create<br>this interesting sort of lineage of<br>ideas that has stayed intact fairly well<br>all the way through us<br>all mention I said that fiton had a law<br>well he did Stevens came along and<br>decided to come up with his own law<br>which was seen as an advancement on FNA<br>law it explained a bit more that was<br>observable about decisions about sensory<br>processes and so he published this very<br>cheeky titled paper to honor Fekner and<br>repeal his law and there's still debate<br>about about whether that law really is<br>not now who am I from another<br>perspective who am<br>I what was it that made me me so here's<br>my um family tree to one level and um<br>I'll just say a little bit about what<br>the background here was so my parents<br>came from Holland and my father was born<br>in 1914 so in the first war<br>and they both lived in a little town<br>called near and<br>in well during the second world war they<br>were occupied and my father<br>unfortunately got taken off to one of<br>the work camps and was there for a<br>period the<br>time and I think by the time the war<br>ended and he came back and they got<br>married they had enough of Europe and so<br>they decided to take their family to New<br>Zealand and before they did that they<br>actually had three kids here and my<br>oldest brother were very religious<br>family he was a brother a religious<br>brother and by the time they were<br>here not long after so they got here<br>actually a year later another brother<br>was born and he had Hunter's<br>disease and so<br>my parents had a very difficult sort of<br>time in many perspectives in this<br>regard and then more were born and is me<br>being born in<br>1965 well that's not me being born then<br>but that's when I was<br>born and you'll see what the ages year<br>that I came 8 years after my nearest<br>sister so for me it was like being an<br>only child in many ways so for people<br>who like to look at Family stories and<br>look at how people relate and coming out<br>of that um that's quite a mixed bag of<br>things that were going on and I think<br>there was<br>this it was a very strange family to be<br>in in that regard given the um history<br>that was there and I think that really<br>did have quite a strong effect on my<br>ways<br>so what did I do in Su way well all<br>started off quite well well it ends up<br>quite well as well so that's not such a<br>such a bad story okay so what could<br>doesn't like dinosaurs here I like<br>dinosaurs when I was a kid and here's an<br>AI generated picture of dinosaurs like<br>playing with AI it does the same silly<br>things that humans do it puts humans<br>into pictures of dinosaurs when they<br>never<br>coexisted why does it do what humans do<br>we won't go there so that's me at 5<br>years old now my sister um was a<br>machinist and liked to make clothing and<br>so I ended up wearing clothing that she<br>made and so 5 years old I was trotted<br>down for a photo shoot with this<br>clothing on and so that's me age when I<br>dinosaurs but things moved on a bit from<br>dinosaurs here's me at around about 9 10<br>years old and here I am in the corner of<br>my garage and I have a zillion different<br>chemicals there that I'm playing around<br>with I became a chemist M and really<br>really loved it and unfortunately I<br>think I was quite a dangerous um sort of<br>chemist the<br>before I move on from my photo of being<br>a chemist there's my telescope I was<br>also an astronomer I was out night after<br>night for years on end looking at things<br>through that tiny little thing that you<br>could really not see much through at all<br>exciting okay so with all my chemicals<br>and stuff there and it's a cool picture<br>thank you Michelle for making a cool<br>picture there are a whole bunch of other<br>things that tied in of this sort of<br>stuff<br>um astronomy photographer dark room work<br>all sorts of stuff that were the acorns<br>of interest and rabbit holes and yes I I<br>think I'm a person who goes down rabbit<br>holes quite a lot and likes to go to the<br>ends of the hole and get something out<br>else now the thing with my chemistry was<br>that it was quite dangerous and I<br>remember I used to like playing around<br>what could doesn't like making fireworks<br>and I remember one time at school we<br>made this firework that took a long to<br>school and a bunch of us boys went up to<br>the back of the field and we lit this<br>thing it was meant to just go<br>bang but instead it didn't go bang it<br>just started oozing smoke and more smoke<br>and more and there this big cloud of<br>smoke and you couldn't escape it and by<br>um one of the teachers the brother be<br>who was from um from pap guine has a<br>really tough fellow um on everyone he<br>saw the smoke he didn't know what to<br>make of it but we still ended up rolling<br>the cricket pitch for many many many<br>days after that which was one of the<br>punishments we had there and and then<br>when I got to seventh<br>form I wanted to show people how you<br>could make light without heat and so we<br>started mixing some chemicals in the lab<br>during lunchtime and came up with a<br>solution that was supposed to work and<br>our chemistry teacher said oh that's<br>cool we're going to the gym lab and<br>we're going to make it dark and this<br>will be one of the demonstrations that I<br>do now what do I do as a silly boy is I<br>make it a little bit stronger than it's<br>really meant to be cuz we had more<br>lights better than a little bit of light<br>and so we're in there and it's pitch<br>black and everyone's silent and all of a<br>sudden the teacher starts pausing the<br>stuff you can't see anything happening<br>and all of a sudden there's this little<br>orange glow and next minute there a big<br>orange splurt like that and fortunately<br>it wasn't hos and it wasn't that<br>dangerous but he did run out and got a<br>very big fright uh from that and I think<br>me so at the end of<br>school which was pretty much when that<br>was I decided not to be a scientist<br>anymore cuz I've done science and done<br>it all I thought and let's do something<br>else because one of my mexs in life is<br>whatever you done there's always<br>something else to do that's great you<br>can always do something different is<br>always something that you can move on to<br>my idea was hey Arts let's do arts so<br>first at University was a whole bunch of<br>Arts it didn't work out very<br>well I haven't failed many<br>papers for there that year and that was<br>the end of Arts out the door back into<br>science end of the story moving mov<br>on<br>okay moving on into<br>psychology and here we have John Ann at<br>the red door so the Sound attenuating<br>Chamber and this was quite a number of<br>years before I turned up and the picture<br>of me at the same Red Door is quite a<br>number of years after John<br>left now John was a strong fluence on me<br>um particularly because he was in an<br>area that I found fascinating but also<br>because his mentorship and guidance uh<br>had purpose and it had passion<br>and I learned a lot from<br>it and so I owe a lot and in fact I owe<br>joining that entire<br>John the then was mainly on sounds that<br>was John's primary area but since then<br>things have moved on a little bit<br>broadened out no longer just sounds now<br>done foods and um earlier you heard a<br>whole L of other areas of sensory<br>experience um perception that I have<br>worked in but one of the longest sort of<br>collaborations that I've had did involve<br>foods and it was with Daniela vanal his<br>song Le he was un were Women's<br>University and we were sort of finding<br>ways to measure differences between<br>stimuli in this case stimul with food<br>products and products where you have an<br>existing product possibly and then you<br>want to modify it in some way but you<br>don't want people to know you've done<br>that because what you're really doing is<br>either making it more cheaply or or<br>you're making it healthier one or the<br>other and quite often those two things<br>are traded off against each other but<br>we spent 10 years looking at various<br>difference tests which I'll talk about<br>shortly and in this project Miriam who's<br>on the left there was particularly well<br>wasn't particularly was entirely<br>involved for the whole length of the<br>project started off by doing a PhD in<br>that area with that group and then kept<br>working afterwards for another probably<br>seven years on this so without Miriam's<br>help this wouldn't really have come<br>together and it was um quite an<br>extensive<br>project so sensory difference testing<br>what's it all about<br>well you can test sensory differences<br>between all sorts of stimuli and that<br>stimul though those stimul can have<br>either um internal variation which means<br>that the variation that causes you to<br>get your answers wrong and<br>discriminating come from processes that<br>are<br>occur let's just say neurally internally<br>a part of your physiology or you can<br>have external variation external<br>variation such as well potato chips are<br>a good example and you got salt on them<br>or you got Spice on them each time you<br>have a chip it's going to be a slightly<br>different size it's going to have a<br>slightly different amount of additive<br>whatever it is so you're actually<br>tasting a slightly different external<br>stimulus and and the differences between<br>different chips are big enough to<br>overwhelm any internal variation that<br>goes on and so that's what drives your<br>perception now another example there is<br>old versus new faces because this<br>relates to memory and so yes you can do<br>the sort of testing with memory and this<br>sort of test and I'll just mention this<br>briefly is one that will come up again<br>later essentially okay we're talking<br>about faces apparently you take<br>10 photographs of faces you show them to<br>a person you put them away now you take<br>those 10 photos and 10 other photos that<br>they haven't seen of people and then you<br>present them one at a time to the person<br>and they have to say whether it was an<br>old face that they' had seen before or a<br>new face that they haven't seen very<br>simple test you can do it with faces you<br>can do it with words you can do it with<br>pretty much anything and it's a really<br>really good test of memory performance<br>soon okay so what have I done here I've<br>crossed out the word sensory okay<br>because back in the day fer our<br>hero used measurable stimula and made<br>rules about measurable stimuli what do I<br>mean by that well his favorite one was<br>weights so you'd have little weights<br>that were slightly different and never<br>have people lift them up<br>and lift another up and say which of the<br>two was<br>heavier and that's objective because you<br>know the mass of those wakes you know<br>the physical<br>value in fact<br>Fetner got his wife to be a participant<br>and his wife listed about 100,000<br>theories later on 1900 roundabout th<br>came along now thir did a lot of stuff<br>but the key thing he did in terms of<br>this was that he moved the whole thing<br>onto unmeasurable stimuli so now you<br>could take things that you can't measure<br>such as the beauty of<br>handwriting<br>and we can't really measure what that is<br>physically but in psychological space<br>people know what it<br>means and what thirst did was said we<br>can use these methods to actually<br>measure psychological space without<br>actually having a physical measurement<br>that goes with<br>it and that step meant that everything<br>measurable which a lot of people still<br>know so what's signal detection Theory<br>well it came about in well 1953 was the<br>year that the very first not publication<br>but technical report came out about<br>signal detection Theory and we can see<br>where signal detection Theory came from<br>by looking back at what people said who<br>came up with it and essentially it comes<br>out of Statistics in particular non and<br>P statistics their limma and also out of<br>Abraham wald's statistical decision<br>Theory so these are two things that<br>we're funnel in and I mean this is non<br>Pearson's stuff up here this is a<br>picture of signal detection Theory don't<br>really care what they are but they look<br>similar and the fact is that that was<br>the modern evolution of signal detection<br>Theory and then in<br>1966 all the things not here is this is<br>the um original technical report and was<br>there something I was going to say about<br>there it comes out of the electronic<br>defense group in the department of<br>electrical engineering so Engineers<br>originally came up with this<br>thing and then it passed over to<br>psychology as well and it was clearly in<br>Psychology by 1966 when GRE and swats<br>published their book on this topic which<br>is still the quintessential book on<br>Signal detection Theory and<br>psychophysics so it crossed over into um<br>now that sounds like a modern sort of<br>history but no here's our hero again<br>because there is evidence clear evidence<br>that Fetner had worked the equations for<br>Signal detection theory in<br>1860 but didn't draw all the nice pretty<br>diagrams that we used to looking at<br>talking about signal detection<br>Theory okay through were developments<br>and it has been<br>but the essential essence of it was<br>thickner Steven link<br>um as some of you may know um went<br>through elements to psychophysics and<br>various other texts that are still in<br>German and managed to track down that<br>this is now well it's well<br>accepted so how broad is signal<br>detection Theory where can we go with it<br>um<br>there's three things about signal<br>detection theory that are<br>important some people know about one of<br>those most people don't there are two<br>that almost no one knows about but they<br>are all really important so I'm going to<br>go through them very quickly response bi<br>everyone hopefully most people know<br>about response bias and how it confounds<br>every single measurement you make of<br>human<br>exception<br>and whether you get responses such as um<br>yes or no responses very simple sorts of<br>things whether you get responses about<br>the nature of stimula whether it's that<br>cheese I just had was a Mainland cheese<br>or it was a what's the other one I got<br>there anchor cheese whether you use<br>raing responses for people whether you<br>use LINE scale responses no matter what<br>sort of response you collect you're in<br>trouble right from the start because<br>whatever you've collected it has<br>response bius associated with it so<br>signal detection Theory provides a way<br>to eliminate that problem in all those<br>responses okay so that's that's the<br>simple one and the one that is usually<br>touted<br>um in<br>courses the next thing it does it makes<br>your measurements of the difference<br>between things independent of how you<br>measure it there's no other way to do<br>that okay so those names there yes no P<br>preference same different Etc then names<br>of standard psychophysical testing<br>methods if you get a person to do each<br>of those methods with the same<br>stimula and then you try and get a<br>number out of that what you're going to<br>get is a different<br>number unless you use signal detection<br>Theory so it enables you to get a<br>unified metric if you like across<br>different ways of collecting information<br>out of people's psychological<br>space so down the bottom here I've got<br>some good measures because signal<br>detection Theory everyone talks about de<br>primer that's just one measure there are<br>many that are very similar some from<br>detection Theory directly some from<br>theories that are a little bit different<br>but the same so things like da log D<br>Michael that<br>counts log<br>Alpha these sorts of measures work well<br>bad to similar measures are things like<br>pc pc is the biggest measure that people<br>use proportion correct it's like how<br>many you got correct over how many you<br>did you can make it percentage correct<br>if you like it's bad it's bad never use<br>that<br>number oh we use it in education how we<br>assess our students oh never use that<br>number and then there's other ones less<br>heard of but they're equally bad and<br>they're all derivatives of each<br>other and the third one is decision<br>strategies and this is a slightly<br>different one because<br>you present information to people<br>sensory information and it's structured<br>in a certain way it's structured by the<br>way the task is done and it's also<br>structured in terms of the sort of<br>um<br>distributions um that are evident in<br>your perception so if we forget about<br>the second one and just think about um<br>the different tasks that we<br>have we can have a task that there are<br>two ways let's say to use that<br>information to come up with a response<br>there may be many more than two uh and<br>here's an example here of exactly what<br>this so there's a thing called the same<br>different task and in the same different<br>task you're given two things and they're<br>either the same or they're different<br>let's leave it at that your job as a<br>participant is to say they're the same<br>or they're different simple now there's<br>two ways you can use that information to<br>come up with your<br>response the information is the same is<br>how you use it makes the difference in<br>what comes out<br>one is to use what's called a difference<br>model difference model is essentially<br>you pay attention to one of those things<br>and then you pay attention to the other<br>thing and you measure the difference<br>between them psychologically and you use<br>that to say whether the same or<br>different if the difference is large<br>Beyond some Criterion you say they're<br>different and if it's smaller you say<br>they're the<br>same then there's this other complicated<br>name thing likelihood ratio model and<br>essentially what that means is you take<br>each independent piece of information<br>each Imus and you make a judgment about<br>them independently so here's the first<br>one you say that was stimulus one and<br>here's another one that one was stimulus<br>one oh they're the<br>same okay so you're making independent<br>judgments and what you get is different<br>outcomes different levels of performance<br>depending on the strategy used so if you<br>don't know how to extract the decision<br>strategy out of your data then the<br>numbers you get can't be compared beyond<br>doing so the RSC curves there<br>essentially illustrate for the same<br>different task that well you get<br>different shaped curves depending on the<br>strategy you use<br>irrespective of<br>um we'll leave it that so one set of<br>curbs are symmetrical these are very<br>symmetrical on this side and these are<br>asymmetrical that's what what you get<br>out of forget about the data points<br>they're not really<br>interesting okay responses what sort of<br>well here we've got things like<br>satisfied and unsatisfied preference of<br>two products liking of things whether<br>you would buy things or not they're all<br>decisions that work for things in the<br>fearian sense that you can actually<br>measure and quantify the stimula in the<br>world or in the fian sense that you<br>don't quantify or you can't Works<br>another way and you can see there's a<br>zillion different ways you can structure<br>styes okay so those are the three things<br>that signal detection Theory can do for<br>the<br>world now the interesting thing is when<br>you start to put these things together<br>in different ways so you can have signal<br>detection theory on Signal detection<br>Theory so assisted decisions so here we<br>have a smoke alarm Okay so the smoke<br>alarm itself is a signal detection<br>Theory device it takes an information it<br>has a Criterion and it makes uh decision<br>about whether there's a fire or not of<br>course sometimes it's right and<br>sometimes it's<br>wrong and then that information what the<br>alarm does feeds into a human monitor to<br>someone who's there observing listening<br>to the information coming from the alarm<br>that person also has a capacity for<br>getting things right and wrong and has a<br>Criterion for making a decision to take<br>action or<br>not and both of those can take<br>information okay so this could be um<br>smoke of course but it could also be<br>visual cues and the smoke arms going to<br>pay attention to smoke but the human may<br>do that as well but the human may use<br>visual<br>cues so you get this sequence of<br>information going through different<br>detection systems and that's more real<br>world sort of stuff if you go over to<br>this diagram over here you can see that<br>we have a device here that does stuff<br>it's producing a medical image it could<br>be an AI device that's giving you advice<br>on some sort of Diagnostics or something<br>else it could be pretty much anything<br>that produces information that a human<br>consumes and then you have the human who<br>consumes it okay so<br>this device has a certain um capacity to<br>render information in a sensible manner<br>that is more likely to be correct than<br>not but it's consumed by this device<br>which does the same thing and so it was<br>Soren actually<br>who made a big deal out of these sorts<br>of chained events which a human is just<br>at the ends of the chain making a<br>decision that's based on other things<br>that are already doing signal detection<br>things okay so that's the signal<br>detection Theory sort of stuff and that<br>brings me to the next thing on my run of<br>stuff to talk about which is the book<br>now most people in the school most my<br>colleagues have heard about the book and<br>the book was a huge project and it<br>started back in uh<br>2010 um at Mount desert island when we<br>were there on<br>and we're there um with Neil McMillan<br>and his wife<br>Judy and on the drive back Neil says I<br>want another edition of this book and<br>you're the only person I know who will<br>have the determination to do it and I<br>thought do I really want to do this or<br>not and then I thought<br>well yeah I do another Rabbit Hole it<br>took took took quite a while to get<br>through that one<br>uh and<br>so that that was an enjoyable project<br>and the book book is going really well<br>now down here in this photo we've got<br>um my colleague Hong Lee so this is on<br>Korea uh and there's Michelle who is<br>sitting right here and<br>Michelle um helps in so many ways uh<br>with my career and my life but here's a<br>concrete example in which writing<br>chapters of books hard work you need<br>someone who is really really great at<br>proof reading and suggesting<br>improvements and making it clearer and<br>Michelle just kept on going with that so<br>thank you this book is yours<br>too and then there's a software okay sdt<br>assistant is the software I'm really<br>going to talk about but software is<br>another rabbit hole for me and so um I<br>think programming is fun and I think<br>that I've done it since I was around<br>about 15 which is when the first<br>personal computers started to appear and<br>did a course<br>um at University of Technology or<br>on programming anyway and dely was the<br>language that I always used and here's a<br>sort of a rabbit hole example of this is<br>I thought one day wouldn't be fine to<br>have a project okay let's write some<br>rostering software for hospitals yep<br>let's do it put it together so we did it<br>and we had it running in um the<br>emergency departments at Oakland and M<br>Shaw hospital for about 3 years and um<br>it worked really really well and they<br>really wanted to keep going with it<br>except that you know what happens in<br>organizations they want software that<br>does everything not just one little<br>specialized job and so so um after 3<br>years that hobby went away there's me<br>falling down a rabbit hole I think AI<br>did that as well here's the real<br>software sdt assistant now this is been<br>put together so that um researchers can<br>well do signal detection Theory without<br>getting major headaches and figuring out<br>how's we actually do that and um this<br>has been under development for a long<br>long time I remember um the olden days<br>the things similar to performance<br>reviews and I had one with Michael<br>Davidson and I said I've written this<br>software and he said you should do some<br>more with that you should make it better<br>and and so I did and 66,0 784 lines are<br>ConEd<br>three so anyone who likes to play with<br>that software you're welcome to just get<br>it off my<br>website and more of the rabbit hole<br>going on here not enough just to do<br>writing<br>software writing software itself is<br>straightforward It's relatively easy no<br>I want it to go as fast as it can go and<br>so here we have some Assembly Language<br>code that I spent there's thousands of<br>lines of this um spent quite a while<br>writing and it made software that would<br>take 3 Days To Run running an hour back<br>in the day and over here we've got<br>extremely optimized sort of mathematical<br>equations that break the huge equations<br>down into common sections and then each<br>section is only calculated once and it's<br>just that simple result that's used<br>moving through and not saying this for<br>any particular reason other than to<br>emphasize my approach to doing things is<br>okay so some examples of some research<br>that's going on music and weird beats<br>Daniel shefer hello<br>Daniel this is um one of Daniel's um<br>areas really and I've been joining in on<br>this for a while is that what are you<br>doing there<br>Daniel and in this particular example we<br>were looking at with a Boral beats can<br>facilitate um autonomic recovery in<br>other words make you relax after you<br>have some<br>stress and binural beats are pretty<br>fascinating things and essentially you<br>take two sine waves that are slightly<br>different in frequency so if you hear<br>each of these one would be beep and the<br>other would be beep so they sounded the<br>same but they're a little bit different<br>and and you take these and you stick one<br>in one ear and one on the other ear and<br>so some in the neural system in the<br>auditory pathway these two signals<br>converge and you get a third beat a<br>third sound that doesn't exist out in<br>the world but exists and is constructed<br>neurally which is really fascina<br>fascinating and the other thing about<br>binaural beats is people always talk<br>about entrainment how you can have these<br>beats and they sort of synchronize with<br>certain wave bands of neural activity<br>and so it's a fun thing to see if it can<br>actually um change how quickly you<br>recover and the short answer is from<br>this particular picture is that it did<br>so this is sitting in silence after<br>being stressed and this is your um skin<br>conductance and so your skin conductance<br>gradually decreases and then sort of<br>levels off plateus around here whereas<br>for all these other things down here<br>these represent list to binural beats<br>and so you get a deeper<br>recovery so it's quite fascinating and I<br>keep getting invitations to conferences<br>nursing conferences to come and talk<br>Daniel then there were the cogo years<br>and cogn Euro years I think my main<br>collaboration um in the school was with<br>Blake Johnson and we um looked into to<br>um dichotic Pitch which is really quite<br>similar to binaural beats in a way it's<br>actually quite different as well but<br>we'll say it's very similar and<br>essentially you take two sounds but<br>instead of them being just sine waves<br>they're bands of noise one band of noise<br>has got a notch in it the other band of<br>noise is very thin a very narrow band of<br>noise actually sounds a little bit like<br>a tone that sort of got<br>a sound going on whereas this broad<br>noise here this stuff is just a hissing<br>sound like you get with water rain<br>roof and you can time shift a little<br>part of that narrow bit there the spit<br>which actually temporarily looks really<br>weird like that and you can then do<br>exactly what you do with binaural beats<br>and put copies into each ear and hey<br>presto you hear this sound that is off<br>to the<br>side so it's<br>lateralized okay once again something<br>that's produced neurally internally<br>doesn't exist out in the<br>world and uh because there's either one<br>object just the hissy sound or one<br>object plus the you've actually created<br>two auditory objects and so what we were<br>looking at was how the brain actually<br>detects auditory objects and how it can<br>discriminate whether there's one of them<br>or there's more than one of<br>them and Vima was heavily involved in<br>this project and um everyone in the<br>faculty knows femma<br>and Blake ran away to Australia and FMA<br>wanted to do a PhD so I ended up<br>supervising Vima through a PhD um when I<br>would not really consider myself a<br>cognitive neuroscientist uh but we did<br>really really well and Vima did<br>excellently<br>then there were the texture years and<br>this is like what is textural complexity<br>that's a question I'm interested in and<br>we got the money because we we're<br>looking at does it influence food<br>consumption which is a big thing and<br>something that I'm not so interested in<br>so my main interest was in textural<br>complexity and what that is and so what<br>is textural complexity it's when you<br>have a food product that um has multiple<br>textures it's perceived as being more<br>complex and if it only has one or two<br>textures it seen as being less complex<br>and what we sort of found was that well<br>that's exactly how it<br>works more interestingly what I found<br>and more relevant to this is that when<br>dealing with a lot<br>they very rarely distinguish<br>between the physical world and the<br>perceptual world or the psychological<br>world two different things<br>and John taught me to always separate<br>those two things and it's true there is<br>a physical world and then there's your<br>perception of it they're related but<br>they're completely different things and<br>so when some scientists talk about<br>textural complexity they're talking<br>about instrumentation measuring stimul<br>and stuff it's a physical thing whereas<br>when I talk about textual complexity<br>well in this case anyway I'm talking<br>about what your perceived experience is<br>that you would call<br>complexity and mapping those two things<br>Challenge and then we've<br>got not too much time<br>okay so I'll go through these quite<br>quickly so this is a different<br>one um so this was with May ping another<br>PhD student and what we're looking at<br>was the difference um in people's<br>ability to detect a certain compound<br>beta ionone which is essentially at low<br>concentrations gives off a violet the<br>smell of<br>violets and what we were interested in<br>doing well what I was interested in<br>doing again was looking at the<br>methodology of this and and there are<br>these things called psychometric<br>functions that are sort of s-shaped<br>curves that look like this that show the<br>strength of a stimulus physically and<br>some measure of your perception of that<br>stimulus on the other<br>dimension and so what we essentially<br>showed in this case was that because<br>there are two different genotypes for<br>beta ionone perception um people who are<br>sensitive or insensitive we were wanting<br>to know what characterizes the<br>difference between them of course the<br>threshold itself will be different<br>because that's by definition what's<br>going on but what's really interesting<br>is that the shape of the curve is<br>actually quite different so this curve<br>here for insensitive people is actually<br>much steeper than the curve for<br>sensitive people so what this means is<br>that there's a difference in the way<br>that encoding is the most likely thing<br>happens for insensitive or sensitive<br>people of this product the more<br>interesting thing yet again is that most<br>people don't actually consider this<br>aspect of psychometric functions let<br>alone um deal with them at<br>all the other thing is you can get R<br>curbs out of this sort of data as<br>well the current project we've got with<br>old faction um is sort<br>of starting shall we say and what we<br>have here um a bunch of ideas that sort<br>of tie together in some ways at least we<br>think they will all Factory thresholds<br>tend to decline as you get older if you<br>get a Corona virus infection and for<br>some neurological disorders okay so it<br>can be a marker of changes in the brain<br>that<br>occur man we know that old factory<br>thresholds can be improved with old<br>factory training and enrichment so you<br>know someone might think oh well does it<br>work the other way and of course there's<br>no logic reason to think that it would<br>but maybe it<br>could and in fact there is some evidence<br>that suggests that cognitive function<br>especially memory can improve with old<br>factory enrichment what's enrichment it<br>means exposing people to different<br>smells over a period of time like daily<br>a different smell each night and let it<br>run through the night for many weeks<br>that's all it is it's it's such a simple<br>thing so this is something that we're<br>keen to look at and Eve um Patterson is<br>sort of driving this project with<br>us and Daniel as<br>well okay the measurement crisis now<br>what's what's the measurement<br>crisis I think this is an important one<br>and<br>um it's important because we make<br>measurements and in this case it's about<br>memory we make measurements and um<br>decisions about treatments related to<br>memory all the time<br>and we need to know that when we measure<br>memory performance that what we are<br>measuring is a person's actual memory<br>ability not their response<br>bias because if we didn't do that we<br>would have various scenarios this being<br>one of them we would have scenarios<br>where drug companies would come up with<br>drugs that treat people and the evidence<br>says that this works but the evidence is<br>actually contaminated with response bias<br>and it may not work at all and this drug<br>goes Global and it may do nothing or it<br>harm and so um some of my colleagues<br>Karen rotello um have done a whole bunch<br>of interesting um analyses of data and<br>this is an example of data that is<br>actually collected from<br>humans and then you use resampling<br>methods to actually look at what's going<br>on in terms of your analysis and now<br>type 1 error rate is sort of something<br>that in statistics at least in<br>Psychology we often set to 005 we're<br>willing to make an erroneous decision 5%<br>of the<br>time and of course setting it at that<br>level sounds nice and dandy but then<br>through these simulations what has been<br>found is that they are very rarely in<br>practice at that level in fact almost<br>never so we've got measures like d prime<br>a prime and so D Prime is meant to be<br>good isn't it yes but no look the error<br>rates are going up dramatically here<br>which is quite a worry because when you<br>get to that point you got 75% erroneous<br>decisions about efficacy of whatever<br>you're trying to look at that's pretty<br>bad and so<br>there's this other measure da and da is<br>a measure that is a signal detection<br>Theory measure but it uses unequal<br>variance distributions okay so it's a<br>slightly more complex signal detection<br>theory model and it does a relatively<br>good job of keeping the type 1 error<br>under control now no one uses<br>it there have been papers that say to<br>use it and they ignore and so at the<br>moment Karen is writing some work um<br>that this has actually come out of U<br>which hopefully will be notice somewhat<br>more because these sorts of decisions<br>decisions do we want generating model<br>I'm going to skip that because it's and<br>we don't need more measurement<br>crisis okay there are more of them I'll<br>tell you about them another time<br>okay so what's going to happen going<br>forward for me and for Signal detection<br>Theory and for psychophysics well I<br>always find that it's good to look<br>across disciplines because signal<br>detection theory is so broad it doesn't<br>just live in Psychology it lives in a<br>whole bunch of relatively independent<br>disciplines psychology sensory science<br>Diagnostics<br>um a lot of computer uh um work as well<br>uses this and so a past a look across<br>these different areas and see what are<br>the differences and what has evolved<br>within those areas and so psychology is<br>where sdt originally took off and where<br>I might say it is now languishing like<br>nobody's business and disappearing from<br>textbooks and Vanishing which is<br>extremely<br>wrong and<br>we've got an established three useful<br>things down there which I talked about<br>before being able to deal with response<br>bias decision strategies and um being<br>able to um get a common measurement out<br>of different<br>tasks and then in sensory science they<br>came up with the idea that binomial<br>distributions which one assumes normally<br>in statistics when dealing with<br>proportions uh well they're over<br>disposed they're not right to use we<br>need to use something that's got broader<br>tals to take into account extra<br>variation and so they've latched onto a<br>little bit onto beta binomial<br>distributions to be<br>used and then in<br>Diagnostics they have incorporated<br>co-variants into signal detection<br>Theory and they've been doing that for a<br>long time psychology we haven't been and<br>so the future is to bring these things<br>together and where one all end up with<br>is something circling around basian<br>hierarchical regression with generalized<br>linear models something in that space<br>really complicated sort of stuff now the<br>danger when you go to that complicated<br>sort of stuff is that you lose the stuff<br>that's come from before so there needs<br>to be a good Handover and a good um well<br>that's exactly the word Handover of<br>information to make sure you don't lose<br>anything in that transition signal<br>detection the that's known now and<br>looked at now in 50 years will um be for<br>educational purposes to teach people<br>about it but when you become expert<br>you'll be doing a lot more than<br>that okay so here's my a road list<br>travel thing which is my approach to<br>um academic life to life in general I<br>think to pursue your interests and let<br>them evolve okay don't focus on<br>something and just stick with it get rid<br>of it once you've done it to death move<br>on have something else going on dare to<br>be passionate about each of them so only<br>choose things to move on to if you're<br>things that does that's about right and<br>for each of them now this is the hard<br>part I guess is to find a successful<br>conclusion get something out of it get<br>satisfaction get<br>need and then don't follow the<br>crowd everywhere I look people are<br>following the crowd they're doing the<br>stuff that's been done for the last 50<br>60 70 years and thinking it's right and<br>it's good and there's nothing new and<br>the new things don't matter don't go<br>down that<br>path don't follow the crowd find the new<br>things grab<br>them and bring them to the light and of<br>course have fun and fun I like Fun's<br>good but then satisfactions good as well<br>and whatever you really want to get out<br>that positive thing that's what you can<br>pursue okay and a couple of<br>acknowledgements well I did quite a<br>bunch of those as I went through<br>students and things but um family and<br>friends of course leading academic<br>lights within psychophysics and<br>elsewhere um all of my students I think<br>students are Inc incredibly important to<br>your academic pathway academic<br>development they're the ones that bring<br>approaches that is really<br>important and then people I haven't<br>mentioned yet are my colleagues within<br>the School of Psychology faculty of<br>Science and the University at large<br>because one doesn't necessarily always<br>agree with what these organizations and<br>these colleagues do or say and sometimes<br>you do but it all works and creates an<br>environment that is conducive to being<br>Collegiate and to being productive and<br>to having fun and thank you for<br>listening<br>thank you Michael I had a fire alarm in<br>my apartment block at highst 5 this<br>morning and I can assure you the human<br>operator had no difficulty Discerning<br>do thank you Michael that was great<br>great talk we've we're over time but<br>we've got time for a couple of questions<br>off yep uh in the one you had about B<br>beats uh most of those frequencies were<br>underneath the human threshold do you<br>find uh to suggest that you can't<br>it<br>AI so with binaural beats the<br>frequencies are low but what's um you<br>can actually if you don't put them into<br>each air and you just play them out in<br>the world in the air you also get a<br>beating pattern and it's the envelope of<br>the sound that you're picking up not the<br>actual<br>question yep so you talk about<br>AI than what doing but how do you<br>believe Ai and what we're seeing will<br>actually affect this<br>field quite majorly it already is um my<br>colleague um Danielle vanel who was at<br>un who I talked about um left uni lver<br>and started up a well didn't start up<br>but joined a company and became the<br>president and it's called AIG Gora which<br>is AIG Gora and what they do is they<br>take data sets from um major providers<br>around the world major food companies<br>and apply AI um to that and managed to<br>extract out some interesting um things<br>that traditional methods haven't been<br>able to it's not to say um it's the<br>begin all and end all of anything um but<br>there's already benefits coming out of<br>that so I think going forward there'll<br>transformation one last<br>question yep so as a take message for<br>educators if we shouldn't be using<br>proportion correct what does signal<br>detction Theory say about how we should<br>well it's an interesting question I<br>guess if you start with multiple choice<br>sort of examples you can extract out<br>something like d Prime from that or you<br>could actually extract out something<br>that's a bit different it's the area<br>under the ROC curve which is a<br>proportion in itself so the ability to<br>interpret that becomes easier because<br>people rather deal with um proportions<br>than they deal with some number like d<br>Prime that goes from zero to Infinity 0<br>to one's easier so you can extract out<br>that sort of information um quite well<br>point thank you<br>Michael have a chat with Michael<br>words I was going to ask a question<br>Michael but I've decided I'm going to<br>it's a rhetorical question I'm going to<br>answer it right now this is um revealed<br>so much to me about how you approach<br>your your working life I was I think<br>Michael's done just about every service<br>role there is in the School of<br>Psychology over the years and I was<br>fascinated to see that you um have done<br>a lot of uh programming and Computing CU<br>remember everybody when Michael was the<br>IT person in the department and my<br>question was going to be whether all<br>your work with decision making made you<br>yourself a uh a quicker and clearer<br>decision maker because that's definitely<br>reflected um in the way you approach the<br>tasks at school at in the school and I<br>really do think on behalf of everyone<br>here you've been you're absolutely<br>pivotal to keeping us going your<br>institutional knowledge and your<br>generosity and the work that you've done<br>for the school over the years especially<br>around<br>um is really deeply appreciated by all</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
