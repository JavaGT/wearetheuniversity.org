I spent over six years studying the ecological interactions, genetics, and distribution of amphibians on Haida Gwaii - and building relationships with people. My work with the Haida Nation, schools, government, farmers, forestry companies and the general public became integral to the success of my project. Societal benefits from science require community engagement and outreach. Increasingly scientists are required to work with the communities in which we do our research to achieve these benefits. But this should not be seen as an inconvenience; often research outcomes improve greatly from community involvement in research. It can be challenging and emotional work. There is no handbook on doing ethical and effective community engagement, as the right approach varies depending on the community. However, there are some commonalities and, in this talk, I will share some lessons that apply to Aotearoa and beyond.<br> <br>Roseanna is a restoration ecologist and National Geographic Explorer who grew up in Te Tai Poutini/West Coast of the South Island.

and one thing that also<br>the remote places in Canada I've been up<br>to Yellow night I've been hi and every<br>remote pretty<br>remote um thank you guys so much for<br>coming uh and for chy for hosting me I<br>really appreciate that um yeah really<br>special to be here but this is my first<br>time at wle<br>University um so yeah pretty cool<br>so<br>yeah um so today I'm going to tell you a<br>story about how I fell in love with a<br>place it's people and toads uh and this<br>is a video that I took of some toads<br>mating because I just wanted to get you<br>in the toad Zone where um just really<br>wanted to dive in this is where we're<br>going for the next we while today um and<br>yeah these are some special little love<br>love<br>toads um I thought since I know there's<br>some grad students around that I'd also<br>share part of my grad student Journey as<br>a part of this talk as well uh so I<br>moved to Canada um Vancouver in 2016<br>started my PhD at University of British<br>columia and I'd actually come there to<br>do a biog geochemistry PhD I was meant<br>to be looking at nutrient cycling and<br>freshwater ecosystems because that's<br>kind of what I did for my honors um but<br>then I was six months into planning this<br>research project um around nitrogen<br>cycling stuff and um I just I just<br>wasn't my heart wasn't in it I was like<br>crap you know I'm going to have to do<br>this for the next four years and and I'm<br>not really feeling it um and luckily in<br>Canada you kind of have um about often<br>up to a year or even a little bit more<br>sometimes to come up with your research<br>proposal so I asked my supervisor and I<br>was like hey I'm really sorry you know I<br>know I came here to do this um but I was<br>wondering could I study something else<br>in Fresh Water this like more<br>conservation applied um and he was like<br>yep absolutely you know I want you to<br>you know enjoy what you're doing<br>because you won't make it through the<br>PHD<br>experience um yeah so then I spent the<br>next few months just looking for species<br>at risk in British Columbia and trying<br>to talk to government<br>biologists um and I came across a few<br>different things um but the thing that<br>really grabbed my attention was this<br>Northern red-legged frog um so this is a<br>frog that's native to the area where I<br>was living around Vancouver and also on<br>Vancouver Island<br>um and it's declining there and what was<br>really interesting is it was introduced<br>by a school teacher um to huay just like<br>kind of for<br>fun and it was first recorded there in<br>2002 and it was booming there there's<br>lots of anecdotal reports but no survey<br>since um it was yeah the like first<br>survey was done in 2002 and I was like<br>oh that sounds really interesting um and<br>then I talked to some more people and<br>then I found oh the plot thickens<br>because there's this toad called the<br>western toad um and it was also native<br>to huay in fact the only native<br>amphibian on huay and since the Frog<br>arrived people had said they noticed the<br>toad was declining and I was like oh wow<br>is there is is that correlation or or is<br>the Frog having some effect there um<br>yeah just a complicated web of questions<br>I was like yes this this is what I want<br>to do my PhD<br>on um so so then I asked permission from<br>the Council of the Haider nation and the<br>BC government come to come and study<br>that um so just for some context hiu<br>there archipelago just believe beneath<br>Southeast<br>Alaska um and hyra translates to islands<br>of the people and it's the home of the<br>high Nation who have lived there since<br>time in Memorial and the population of<br>people on the island is around about<br>5,000 and yet there's a mix of it's<br>mostly hia and then yeah a bunch of<br>non-h immigrants who have come on and a<br>lot of people living off grd in the<br>forest uh the land area for Contex is<br>about six times the size of raki St<br>Island and it's temperate rainforest<br>with Lush con ofer Forest endless<br>Wetlands rugged coastlines and extremely<br>high R rainfall like higher than the<br>South Island at the West Coast it's like<br>4 meters a year and the the first summer<br>the that I was there for 5 months uh<br>there were only 10 days where it didn't<br>rain um and yeah so I moved there for<br>five months and I came there with my my<br>then partner we ended up breaking up at<br>the end of the F season don't employ<br>your partner as your field<br>assistant but yes so we we moved into<br>this flat with a bunch of locals um it<br>was this little Shack like right by the<br>EST you could see like the tide coming<br>in and out and there was no insulation<br>in the walls and like the door would<br>just fly open in the middle of the night<br>when a storm would come in um and<br>anyways I just yeah I became the part of<br>the community I made lots of friends I<br>yeah went to Beach fires I joined the<br>choir I joined a band um yeah and just<br>like really got to know<br>people um and then I was like all right<br>well this is really fun but you know at<br>the same time I was also doing research<br>so um so the first thing was to find<br>where the northern reg red-legged frog<br>had spread since<br>2017 so yeah it's been a lot of time<br>tromping through bogs um driving<br>forestry roads getting to use radios<br>which I thought was super cool talk to<br>the logging truck uh drivers and you can<br>see yeah the cut block there so that was<br>pretty confronting um just like that was<br>how we got to access the beautiful areas<br>was through these logging roads and<br>through these cut blocks and and um yeah<br>Heard lots of there was lots was it lots<br>of mixed um opinions on the island cuz<br>it's on one hand the logging is a big<br>source of employment but on the other<br>hand it's destroying their ecosystems um<br>so yeah it was yeah uh like a a fiery<br>political climate actually when I was<br>there about<br>logging um so the results from that<br>survey the I'll just take you through<br>the of different points here so the<br>stars are the observations from the 2002<br>survey it's meant to be a star there um<br>and so that's the area that they<br>approximately occupied in 2002 this blue<br>diamondy thing and then um my 2017<br>points that's the red ones there that's<br>where we found um the northern red Leed<br>frog and then so that kind of created<br>this um yellowy kind of shape to show<br>where they where they' spread and then<br>the yellow diamonds aware absences where<br>we didn't find them and so what was<br>quite interesting is that yeah we had a<br>whole bunch of absences around here but<br>then we had some presences here and<br>there's a there's some logging going on<br>there and there's a small community uh a<br>minite community over there so um from<br>there I kind of assuming that probably<br>this was human assisted cuz yeah they<br>couldn't have got over this this is<br>really f fast flowing deep water in here<br>um yeah so the they found that the that<br>size that was 15-fold increase and about<br>a rate of 1.9 km per year dispersal<br>which is yeah pretty<br>fast um and I also did some climate<br>change modeling and I was going to use<br>and the point of the slide is not the<br>results of this but the the community<br>aspect which was that um I was me I was<br>going to use a one<br>um gri size to project yeah we like<br>climate suitability for this frog and um<br>yeah I spoke to some local land managers<br>and they were like oh actually that's<br>too coarse for us like yeah we would<br>really like if you could um increase<br>resolution to 250 meters I like okay<br>sweet that's going to involve a lot more<br>RAM and yeah qgr crashed a lot but it<br>resulted in yeah higher quality data and<br>more useful data for them so I was super<br>glad to yet like I would I'd often like<br>pop into the office like the different<br>offices of the land managers when I was<br>there on hiu which yeah kind of meant<br>that um it was able to be like a bit of<br>back and forth about how I was going<br>about<br>things um<br>so yeah so yeah frogs were definitely<br>spreading so what did that mean for the<br>toad um so I ran a little experiment<br>with some Tad poles from um the Frog and<br>also the one L on my survey to found<br>find frogs I'd randomly stumbled across<br>one toad breeding site um and so I had<br>some yeah some to Frog and Toad tpes<br>trying to look at<br>competition and one of my friends Kate<br>she was really curious about what I was<br>doing in my backyard she' like come over<br>and be like what are all these tanks<br>there I mean everyone would be like what<br>is she<br>doing and she was a primary school<br>teacher and so she was like I think you<br>know my kids would actually be really<br>interested in this um so she asked if<br>she could bring them over so yeah I had<br>a whole class of kids come over and they<br>were weighing the different tpes and um<br>they had super super good time um and<br>that's how my journey with Community<br>science really started and the Outreach<br>stuff um because yeah I just saw how<br>yeah it was pretty sweet um so after<br>that like a few weeks after that class<br>came two girls from the class Nora Jane<br>and Laya they made a toad puppet<br>show I was like yes like this is<br>actually that the science Outreach is<br>actually having a measurable impact in<br>puppet<br>shows um and following on from um kind<br>of community events and things um just<br>like from chatting to people chatting to<br>parents um I learned that the toad is<br>very culturally significant to The Hider<br>and that um because there was all this<br>talk of frogs everywhere and I was like<br>oh there you know must be a frog but I<br>did kind of Wonder but then yeah um I<br>found out that actually it was a mation<br>and that a lot of the oral history is<br>talking about the<br>Frog um and the like on the some of the<br>art and things where a frog is depicted<br>it's actually uh they're talking about<br>the<br>toad um and that was massive it was like<br>oh I just like really started to<br>comprehend how important this toad was<br>um and The Hider name for it<br>isanan which means crab from the<br>bushes um I've just noticed my there's<br>some weird formatting that's happened<br>with the PowerPoint but that's all right<br>um so yeah I this was I was starting to<br>get a little bit distracted at this<br>point from the frogs um starting to feel<br>like maybe I should uh yeah look at the<br>Toads a bit more um especially as I was<br>hearing How concerned locals were they<br>noticed declines places where they were<br>um had them as a kid that no longer were<br>um I also heard stories of people just<br>trying to like rescue their toads um<br>like if the like a pond was drying up<br>and there were toad head Poes there try<br>and like put them in another pond close<br>by and um yeah just felt like people<br>really cared about this animal and part<br>of the problem was that people didn't<br>know where they were um and yet there<br>was like that one side I stumbled on and<br>then like another site on a massive Lake<br>they knew was somewhere there but yeah<br>there's kind of just yeah where were<br>they and so we couldn't really figure<br>out how they were doing and what was<br>going on without knowing where they<br>where they were<br>breeding um and yeah when I arrived to<br>huay local biologist said like oh like<br>you're not going to find the toads like<br>we've looked um and I was like oh no but<br>I want to look again<br>like um so I thought okay I'm going to<br>try a different strategy because like<br>their strategy was kind of a bit of like<br>a a ram rambling R random something<br>design rambling I mean it was kind of<br>rambling I<br>think but yeah so I was like actually<br>I'm going to ask the community like<br>where have you guys seen toads like<br>please send me all of your toad<br>observations um so I put up posters<br>everywhere I just had all these toad<br>posters and I was like I don't know how<br>this is going to go like people yeah the<br>government biologists were like yeah I<br>don't know if people are going to be<br>super interested in this like we'll see<br>um but actually people were and I<br>received a lot of observations um and so<br>yeah there was this kid um for instance<br>I'm 10 years old and I live on hiu and<br>on Friday the 13th of April I saw a<br>western toad we're walking on Spirit<br>Lake um at the time and it was like 755<br>and luckily got a picture and he was<br>about the size of a large avocado like<br>that's really large um but unfortunately<br>in this case this was actually a frog so<br>yeah so and I I had a lot of these<br>observations that yeah people thought<br>were toads but were actually frogs I was<br>like ah okay yeah um so I saw there was<br>a need for yeah some Science<br>Education um so I made a um<br>identification guide um and yeah I gave<br>it to school teachers and stuff and um<br>also like yeah anyone who like emailed<br>me through kind of observations so were<br>maybe not the spe they thought they were<br>um but there were also a bunch of really<br>solid observations we're definitely<br>toads um and so what I would do is I<br>took them put them on a map and Drew a 2<br>km radi radio around them and then had a<br>bunch of so many water bodies to check<br>um and so yeah that was the<br>strategy and ended up samping a lot of<br>different<br>places um and oh and like I something<br>about the oh no I should mention that<br>later um so yeah I involved community<br>members of all ages in some of these<br>searches um because yeah some of these<br>water bodies were pretty large so it was<br>very helpful to have people um had<br>school groups sometimes um and this is<br>one place I went to on the west coast um<br>K Lake um and yeah just uh amber and Ian<br>reached out to me they saw one of these<br>posters and they were like oh like we<br>were on a picnic one time and we saw um<br>yeah we saw these like little toads um<br>like do you think this might be a toad<br>breeding site and I was like well yeah<br>let's go find out so yeah they asked if<br>um I wanted to come back with them to<br>this Lake and it was quite an adventure<br>we nearly capsized that little<br>boat coming<br>in<br>um yeah yeah a lot of these places were<br>yeah one of the most beautiful places<br>to yeah it was really special to go into<br>a valley where it hadn't been logged and<br>yeah come through to this Lake um which<br>I ended up having to swim across to find<br>head Poes and you can see here um the<br>Toads they they lay their eggs in Long<br>strings in the<br>vegetation um and they yeah they always<br>come back to these some sites which is<br>why we were looking for them all right<br>so this is the before before this giant<br>search um there were these yeah sites<br>known in guanes and then one up here<br>kind of an approximate location um and<br>then afterwards this is what we got so<br>we found nine previously unrecorded C<br>breading sites which may not sound like<br>a lot but it took a lot of effort to<br>find these<br>um and one of these sites was on a<br>farmer's property um the reens and they<br>were so excited that um there was a toad<br>brating site because they used to get<br>off their tractors to rescue toads like<br>um and so they asked they're like oh how<br>can we protect this toad breeding site<br>um and I said well you know it would be<br>awesome if you could delay harvesting<br>and leaving a buffer around the pond and<br>so I was driving past um a couple months<br>later at the end of the summer and I saw<br>that they left this giant buffer around<br>the pond and it was like one of the best<br>moments of my life it just like oh my<br>gosh actually having an impact with this<br>work um yeah so I was very very stoked<br>um all right so yeah I found all these<br>Tobe breing s sites and I was like all<br>right now super excited for the<br>possibilities like came back to<br>Vancouver I was like fing and then my<br>PhD Supervisor was<br>money and I was like oh okay um you know<br>and he's like yeah so like I don't have<br>any more money for you um so you're<br>going to have to find another PhD<br>project that like doesn't involve like<br>basically doing anything else on<br>hiu um yeah I just can't afford it sorry<br>um and I was like what like no like this<br>is my dream project and like the<br>community so invested they want to know<br>um and he's like well yeah I guess like<br>you know if if you could find other<br>funding but like you know you probably<br>can't so and I was like yes I<br>will yes so then I applied for some<br>funding um and yeah very luckily got it<br>so I got some funding from National<br>Geographic and also there was this<br>public ask initiative at University of<br>British Columbia that they' started to<br>fund kind of projects like mine where<br>they were um involving work with<br>communities and then also I was<br>collaborating with someone at the in the<br>ministry of forests with BC government<br>and yeah so they had some funding to<br>bring to the table too so I got to go<br>back um and then I also like kind of<br>collaborated with um gu harness Parks<br>Canada um where they let me like I was<br>volunteering for them in exchange for<br>being able to get access to a remote<br>location via boat um and so that worked<br>out really well so yeah this is the trip<br>into gry harness just so I give you a<br>little<br>so much<br>they like to swim in a kind of train<br>cool so yeah very very grateful to gone<br>there um so now yeah we had we had a<br>bunch of samples from from from guanas<br>National Park from other places um in<br>huay from those nine sites um and yeah<br>no was and yeah a couple other sites as<br>well and so I wanted to ask are toads on<br>hu genetically distinct um because yeah<br>I kind of wondered you know they were so<br>isolated from the other<br>populations um so that involved not only<br>you know something on Hu but um with the<br>help of the British yeah with Melissa<br>Todd from um the BC government something<br>and other places in British Columbia as<br>well 47 different breeding<br>sites and yes I found that these TOS are<br>super distinct um almost the level of<br>subspecies kind of there's a there's a<br>bunch of different things that have to<br>happen for it to be designated a<br>subspecies um but in terms of the kind<br>of genetic differentiation piece that<br>was yeah up there with that uh and they<br>also have half the genetic diversity um<br>which could you know potentially have<br>conservation implications in terms of<br>maybe it might make them a bit more<br>vulnerable to environmental changes if<br>they don't have as much genetic<br>diversity um okay so from that result<br>and a bunch of other stuff in my PhD I<br>um and from listening to the community<br>about you know how consume they were<br>about toads and how important this was I<br>realized that what the toad really<br>needed was protection of these breeding<br>SES because they're just they're so<br>important to the for this toad to be<br>able to persist um and yeah I kind of<br>also heard stories of how yeah some<br>people may have like accidentally kind<br>of destroyed some toad breading sites<br>just by not knowing where they were um<br>and by like accidentally digging up some<br>overwintering toads so the Toads kind of<br>hibernate um the overwinter and the mud<br>and stuff and so yeah just like kind of<br>thinking okay it'd be awesome to run um<br>yeah Community monitoring program that<br>um gets some baseline data and also<br>raises awareness um of these breing<br>sites where they are and also how to<br>find new ones as<br>well so two days after I defended my PhD<br>thesis in 2022 I flew to huay for six<br>weeks to um yeah to try and help start a<br>toad monitoring program and I had the<br>help of Christine Rock who was a<br>government biologist on huay she was<br>super supportive really helpful and then<br>I kind of had the unofficial support of<br>the Council of the H nation and BC Parks<br>um in Ministry of forest and the aim was<br>to Aid conservation of toads on huay<br>through long-term monitoring and<br>increase knowledge and the the goals of<br>that season were to collect data on<br>timing of breeding number of breeding<br>peers and monitor<br>predection so we ran training workshops<br>to work out yeah to identify and count<br>toads um and had people adopt a toad<br>breading site and then I also ran um<br>talks in<br>schools um and yeah some like public<br>talks and stuff at the same time and<br>this was it yeah kind of still when Co<br>was quite present and people were still<br>quite nervous about it so I didn't have<br>that many people turn up to the the<br>talks but a lot of people came out to<br>the training sessions and I kind of yeah<br>would make like a day of it sort of I'd<br>like yeah provide food and we'd have<br>like a picnic together after the<br>training and um yeah so it was really<br>popular with families<br>especially um and this is an example of<br>the citizen science kits that we had out<br>at the toad breeding sites um including<br>polarized sunglasses so you can see uh<br>see through the<br>water uh and yeah here's a couple of<br>pictures from the school field trips<br>were which were awesome but super<br>chaotic as you could imagine but yeah it<br>was really cool like the kids really<br>would respect the site it be like all<br>right<br>like um and then people went out and<br>monitored toad breeding sites<br>independently for a month coordinated by<br>three site leaders um via email lists um<br>and yeah there was kind of turned out<br>there were a bunch of really consistent<br>dedicated volunteers and then because of<br>life and the fact that hiig like people<br>are um subsistence living a lot and this<br>was now the the harvesting season for<br>them like to get enough food to last the<br>summer and like can stuff for the winter<br>so yeah people really dropped off um in<br>terms of their involvement and I also<br>found that like we we used I naturalist<br>because I wanted something that would<br>like be accessible for people to like<br>you know when I moved on or whatever it<br>would still be available um and yeah<br>some people were able to use the app<br>fine and others kind of struggled so I<br>had the stter sheet that people could to<br>enter in um but yeah it was um it would<br>have been awesome if ID had money to<br>fund someone to kind of really just into<br>data sheets um that would have really<br>helped but I think that in terms of kind<br>of what it Leed to was like one of the<br>main outcomes was that people knew where<br>these tow breing sites were and how to<br>care for them um and how to look yeah<br>how to like determine between the<br>different<br>species um and so yeah we res Ed and<br>having um our first like breeding counts<br>um had first Baseline data set um I also<br>wrote a song about toads and how much I<br>love<br>them um and then we also figured out<br>what was skinning the Toads alive so<br>what you see here is um that's a toad<br>skin there and then these are the eggs<br>so this was a pregnant female who was<br>going to lay eggs but<br>unfortunately someone got her before<br>that was possible um and yeah at one<br>site we found 37 of these dead SK um and<br>we'd heard reports uh from in guanes<br>National Park um that maybe raccoons<br>were doing this so we set up some<br>cameras and did some detective work and<br>yeah we found a lot of raccoons hanging<br>out you can see this raccoon here kind<br>of like I think yeah there's some dead<br>toad stuff there and they like having a<br>nibble I didn't actually catch them<br>skinning the Toads they're trying to<br>avoid the poison in the skin um but yeah<br>I didn't actually capture that moment<br>but I did find um we found lots of like<br>raccoon for prints around these dead<br>toads so you put you know two and two<br>together um and yeah so this like really<br>raised the public awareness of the issue<br>because it had just been in you know the<br>national park where harness which a lot<br>of people don't go to like people just<br>weren't aware that this was happening um<br>and yeah that that was pretty<br>interesting for me cuz from new coming<br>from New Zealand you know where like<br>species control is very normalized um it<br>was it a bit different there because you<br>know this is although raccoons are<br>invasive on huay they're not invasive in<br>other places in Canada and so although I<br>would say yeah like<br>95% of the people were like super like<br>okay yeah we've got to control these<br>raccoons there was like a very vocal<br>minority of animal rights activists on<br>the island who were like we can't kill<br>these creatures um and so I was like<br>okay this is now where I sit back like<br>yeah I've kind of that's yeah so that<br>was kind of an interesting point to be<br>like oh like drawing the line of like<br>yeah okay this is this is where it's<br>like no longer my place to be involved<br>in this aspect of things um the<br>community yeah needs to work<br>out so yeah after this um it was yeah<br>pretty intense six weeks like having<br>just offended my thesis um I was pretty<br>burnt out to be honest um and yeah I was<br>just like and also just like will this<br>keep going like are are the Toads yeah<br>going to um do better in the future um<br>and yeah just also just knowing that the<br>pressures of the other issues on the<br>island with yeah logging being a massive<br>one like there are other much bigger<br>battles to fight and so yeah where the<br>Toad's going to um get attention um<br>however I'm I'm feeling more optimistic<br>now because I was invited by the Council<br>of the heer nation and the ministry of<br>Forest to meet um with them over Zoom<br>cuz I was back in Alo at that point and<br>they wanted to hear kind of what were my<br>yeah conservation findings um and um<br>then like yeah after I gave my talk they<br>just like launched into discussion about<br>how they could control raccoons and like<br>oh like where could we apply for money<br>and um yeah so I was feeling yeah super<br>stoked about that um and then also I got<br>an email from a school teacher um and<br>she sent me this picture of yeah this is<br>like awes awesome display that her class<br>did about toads and I was just like yes<br>like this yeah I think the toads are<br>going to be okay<br>like so yeah that was um that was<br>awesome uh and finally just to finish um<br>these are my top tips for building<br>Community Partnerships say yeah make<br>friends not contacts um yeah build<br>genuine relationships with people and<br>become more than a scientist and keep in<br>touch with people in the community<br>and be patient and flexible and always<br>ask first and be humble and listen and<br>also sharing food is really important as<br>well um so yeah thank you so much for<br>all of these amazing people provide so<br>much support and help from lots of<br>people in the community um and<br>University of British Columbia and some<br>and like some people in um New Zealand<br>as well um who helped me out so super<br>grateful and thank you all for listening<br>yeah yeah I<br>yes I would agree with that um so you<br>for people on Zoom um Frank was just<br>asking about like kind of how um whether<br>the toad was having kind of a negative<br>impact on sorry the Frog the r leg good<br>frog whether it was having a negative<br>impact on the toad and yeah I found with<br>the competi I ran like a much bigger<br>competition experiment and I only found<br>like a pretty um small negative effect<br>of the Frog on the toad and I don't know<br>um how much that scales up to like a<br>population level effect and also I think<br>even if it does which it may um have<br>like a small it may it may have some<br>impact I still think the the the like<br>the invasive raccoons and The Accidental<br>distraction of the toad breeding sites<br>are much yeah more threatening so yeah I<br>kind of and also those ones are easier<br>to do something about than the Frog as<br>blogging oh right yeah yeah and then<br>like you know where Land Development and<br>yeah<br>question admir your videos phot so I<br>know<br>that of that is really important so is<br>that part of your that you needed to cat<br>all these videos did you have a GoPro<br>yeah I I did have a GoPro and yeah they<br>they yeah they did have a big emphasis<br>on wanting us to try and capture lots of<br>yet different photos and videos and um<br>they it turns out they haven't really<br>done anything with them but but they<br>still really want to better get it I'm<br>glad that I had that push because yeah<br>it did like make me take a lot more<br>media than maybe I normally would have<br>yeah just thinking about it D CHR a he<br>was saying that times people go to when<br>it comes to you know putting out their<br>publication and then they go and do a<br>press release and media is like cool<br>so you're doing your thing and that<br>actually I was yeah hi like 20,000 away<br>yeah so having that stuff is really<br>yeah<br>yeah yeah great question so just for<br>people on Zoom um asking about whether<br>there were other Predators besides um<br>raccoons and yeah I um I also did wonder<br>about feral cats I never caught any on<br>video but it's entirely possible that<br>sorry Yet on on the cameras um it's<br>entirely possible FAL cats they could<br>have also had some um yeah native<br>Predators such as sandill cranes and<br>Martins um but yeah never caught any on<br>camera um but yeah it's it's definitely<br>an area it would be great if people<br>yeah<br>yeah yeah no I think<br>I think they at everything they're just<br>yeah I guess I've decided that toads are<br>tasty and so and also because the Toads<br>breed on mess there like it's like a<br>SnoWest board like they're all there at<br>the same time and they're like oh sweet<br>I can just walk along and grab a<br>toad<br>yeah uh yeah so I'm feeling a bit like a<br>fish of water at moment because now I'm<br>in marine<br>ecosystems um using this really complex<br>genetic tool called transomics which I'm<br>still trying to wrap my head around um<br>but yeah that's a project working with<br>different communities um across Alor<br>trying to build climate change<br>resilience into different chimana um so<br>we're looking at Power Koda and Kenna<br>and the idea is we're looking at these<br>heat shock genes um to try and see if<br>there are more resilient populations um<br>in response to to Marine heat waves and<br>if maybe if the communities want to if<br>they want to um you know if we find some<br>more resilient populations and<br>communities want to ENT breed and like<br>get with that with those more resilient<br>areas then that's in their hands to do<br>so yeah and so that's a community based<br>project yeah so yeah working like yeah<br>we're only sampling with the communities<br>um yeah we working with yeah three at<br>the moment um yeah near um yeah and<br>like the East tago taiy committee um<br>Nago um sorry like Nago uni um and then<br>um also um maafia um yeah Ma Tha on the<br>west coast near H um and then akador um<br>T<br>foodi yeah um yeah and then I am hoping<br>to get into frog stuff as well yeah here<br>yeah<br>thanks I the opportunity by the council<br>many many years ago<br>your<br>that give you a up of a<br>walk oh<br>wow so much oh and some other stuff wow<br>that's<br>beautiful awesome thank you coming along<br>we to go gra some so you're very all of<br>um us thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
