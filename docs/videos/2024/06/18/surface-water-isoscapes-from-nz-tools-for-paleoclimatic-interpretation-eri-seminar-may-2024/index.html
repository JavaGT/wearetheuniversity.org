Here, I show the climatic controls on the spatial variability in South Island river water oxygen isotope values. The strongest controls are winter temperature and physiography, including the influence of the high southern Alps. Isoscapes – maps of the stable isotopic composition of the river waters – have utility in paleoclimatology, climate dynamics, and other fields. A current campaign in 2024 will expand coverage to the North Island and with repeated sampling on the South Island, to better constrain remaining uncertainties. <br><br>Matthew Lachniet is a Professor of Geoscience at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, and a current Fulbright Scholar to Aoteoroa New Zealand in 2024. He is a Climate Scientist with a focus on Paleoclimatology: the study of climate variations over the last few hundred thousand years. He has field sites spanning from the Western United States, Central America, and New Zealand, among others. The main goals of his research are to understand why climate has experienced natural shifts in the past in precipitation amount and temperature, typically through stable isotopic geochemistry of natural hydroclimate archives. These data help us to understand how climate variations have affected human systems and history in the past and provide lessons for future adaptation to anthropogenic climate change.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>um<br>yeah kot hello everyone um it's my<br>pleasure today to welcome professor<br>Matthew Ln someone whose work has<br>featured quite heavily in my literature<br>review so I'm very excited for<br>this um Matthew is a full professor of<br>geology at the University of Nevada Las<br>Vegas um he has also been the department<br>chair for some time until the middle of<br>last year<br>and he is uh his research focuses on<br>studying past and present climate<br>Dynamics mostly through the use of<br>stable and light light stable isotopes<br>and geological archives such as paave<br>minerals um he's not going to talk about<br>that today I think he's mostly going to<br>talk about his work that he's been doing<br>in New<br>Zealand um and is currently doing<br>actually as part of his full right us um<br>scholarship that he's here for six<br>months I believe yeah and yeah I think<br>that's that's all okay thanks thanks<br>thanks<br>for yeah thank you for having me great<br>to be here um so I wanted to talk a<br>little bit about some some research that<br>we have done and uh research that is<br>building on that now that we're moving<br>forward with some some additional um<br>analyses<br>um and I just wanted to at first<br>acknowledge a lot of the collaborators<br>that I've been working on with uh with<br>this first um Drew Lori is sponsoring me<br>he's at Nea up in Auckland um so I'm<br>affiliated with niwa at the moment on on<br>the full bright scholarship that I have<br>here but this work really began um with<br>my colleagues at otago um Chris and<br>Christina um because they've been<br>longtime friends and they invited me<br>down in<br>2016 which was on my last IAL to um some<br>to do some of this work here and now I'm<br>on my next sabatical seven years later<br>um trying to improve on what we did the<br>first time<br>around um and then uh other collaborator<br>Seb has been really uh helpful he came<br>on one of the sampling tours um before<br>um Alice Hill at Nea has done some<br>sampling um Adam and a whole bunch of um<br>otago grad students have been really<br>helpful and kind of giving feedback on<br>the project I like do these types of<br>projects as collaborative as possible to<br>hear other outside perspectives about<br>how to do the sampling and the and the<br>science as well so I think it just kind<br>of improves the the process um uh pretty<br>significantly so what I'm going to talk<br>about are what we call isoscapes<br>isoscapes are basically maps of uh<br>stable isotope values U and I'm going to<br>talk about the project here in New<br>Zealand which is focused on the south<br>island and talk a little bit about how<br>they're very useful for helping us<br>understand climate Dynamics in the<br>modern perspective but also as tools to<br>help us interpret paleoclimate<br>paleoclimate is what I mainly focus on<br>myself with cave deposits I'm not<br>working on the caves here there's<br>already plenty of people working on<br>caves here but this type of stabil<br>isotope work is useful for understanding<br>the signal that's preserved in cave<br>deposits in terms of the oxygen Isotopes<br>in particular so what I'm going to<br>mainly talk about today is is the paper<br>that came out in<br>2021 that was based on the river isos<br>isoscapes for the south island and what<br>we learn from that and then I'll kind of<br>lead into some of the broader<br>implications of how we can use these<br>isoscapes and then look at the the next<br>steps uh what we're actually working on<br>now in 2024 to improve this notably by<br>adding the North Island right um so we<br>get a broader Geographic coverage um so<br>this is the paper that came out in paleo<br>oceanography and paleoclimatology in<br>case you're interested in kind of<br>following up a little bit more with what<br>we did so the the main question is why<br>do this why isoscapes first we have to<br>ask what is an isoscape it's a it's a<br>map of stabil isotopic compositions so<br>I'm going to go back to this first slide<br>here the colors that you see on the<br>south island are the inferred oxygen<br>isotopic values of small rivers for the<br>South Island right so it this is the<br>isoscape that we produced here and you<br>can see the scale Bar Blues are minus<br>four that's a higher value the Reds<br>areus 11- 12 they're lower values so<br>what we're doing is building these types<br>of maps to help us understand the<br>climate Dynamics so I'm going to show<br>you how we produced this map and what<br>went into producing this map so that we<br>can understand the the ways that climate<br>is controlling the the spatial<br>variations in the stabilized<br>now the reason we're interested in this<br>is because paleoclimate records are<br>using stable isotopes either from cave<br>deposits with spelio stalagmites so they<br>use the oxygen isotopes of carbonate uh<br>we use hydrogen Isotopes in leaf waxes<br>and in O uh ocean sediment cores and in<br>Lake sediment cores um the F lands<br>National Park where Chris Mo has been<br>working a lot they're using hydrogen is<br>there and so one of the questions is<br>well what's controlling those um<br>variations in the<br>downcore um hydrogen Isotopes or in the<br>spam Isotopes over time right so the<br>important thing to remember in all of<br>this is that the stable isotopes of<br>oxygen and hydrogen are strongly related<br>to climate so they're encoding climatic<br>information so from that if we have a<br>modern understanding we can apply this<br>to the Past much better uh we can also<br>use this for stable isotope forensics<br>I'll give some examples of how we might<br>use that for provenancing bird feathers<br>or sheep's wool or human bones or teeth<br>for example um and also then relaying<br>this back or relating this back to the<br>climate Dynamics right so this is just a<br>couple of examples of you know coring<br>Lake sediments or using cave<br>deposits so what we're primarily<br>interested in doing here is using the<br>spatial Vari<br>variations essentially at one particular<br>time correlating the isotopic values to<br>mean climate parameters so we we take a<br>measurement of oxygen Isotopes and the<br>river waters and then correlate them<br>against climate Fields so essentially<br>we're substituting space for time so we<br>do very dense sampling at one particular<br>time interval over a span of a of a few<br>weeks for example and then we can relate<br>that in terms of the the the spatial<br>variation which has climatic gradients<br>associated with them and then we can<br>quantify the relationships between the<br>stable isotopes and these climatic<br>parameters we can identify which climate<br>process is the most controlling for the<br>isotopic<br>values and that helps us develop<br>predictive statistical models that<br>allows us to create the isoscapes these<br>maps that anybody can then use to try<br>try to make a prediction of what the<br>isotopic value at any spot in New<br>Zealand might be if they were to sample<br>a<br>river um and then uh the final part is<br>I'm going to talk about what we're doing<br>now uh updating this with more recent<br>samples okay before I get into the the<br>real science I I I imagine that there<br>are people here who haven't had a whole<br>lot of experience with oxygen Isotopes<br>so I would just want to step back a<br>little bit and talk about what oxygen<br>Isotopes are in the notation that we use<br>so we all know the water H2O but it<br>turns out there's many different<br>isotopes in that water and<br>h216o is the more standard type but<br>we're also interested in<br>h218o so 180 is that rare stable isotope<br>so when we're looking at stable isotopes<br>in water we're actually looking at that<br>ratio of how much 180 versus 160 is in<br>that water sample relative to some sort<br>of standard so we use this notation<br>called Delta notation where it just is<br>looking at the variations of how of the<br>180 to 160 ratio in a water sample<br>relative to standard mean ocean water so<br>the ocean has some value and the river<br>water samples can either be higher than<br>that or lower than that so the Delta<br>values when it's negative it means you<br>have less<br>18o than ocean water when it's positive<br>means you have more ATM mostly we're<br>going to be in the negative territorial<br>like -4 to -12 right so that's um where<br>this Delta notation comes from and I'll<br>be using this term Delta 18o a lot right<br>so it's that oxygen isotopic ratio in<br>that particular water and there's an<br>equation for this that doesn't matter<br>too much that just um just to know that<br>we're looking at those variations<br>relative to the same ratios in Ocean<br>one now we take this a little bit<br>further in a in a subdiscipline that I<br>like to call stable isotope climatology<br>so we all know climate right you measure<br>the temperature you measure relative<br>humidity you average it over a long<br>period of time those are climate<br>variables temperature relative humidity<br>wind speed Etc you can look at different<br>temperatures maximum temperature minimum<br>temperature median temperature July<br>temperature said all those are different<br>climate variables I like to think of<br>oxygen Isotopes as also being a climate<br>variable because it's so sensitive to<br>climatic processes it's just that it's<br>not measured very much but I like to<br>think of oxygen Isotopes as being a<br>primary climate<br>variable and because we can make that<br>connection we can actually do<br>climatology studies just with the stable<br>isotopes and the reason it works is that<br>we have multiple isotope effects that<br>control the oxygen isotopic values of<br>rainfall and hence river water and<br>ground water ice and Ice cores<br>Etc uh so I'll just talk really briefly<br>about a couple of those as way of<br>introduction to understand this and then<br>move on to how paleoclimate records like<br>like edent cores or ice cores or spel<br>ofms are encoding this information in<br>them and looking at those<br>variations so for example this is a<br>graph that shows what something called<br>the temperature effect where we look at<br>the Delta 180 values of precip ation<br>which is on the Y AIS versus temperature<br>and you can see that there's roughly a<br>linear<br>relationship between mean annual air<br>temperature and the oxygen isotopic<br>values of<br>rainfall um so this is known as the<br>temperature effect and it's the basis<br>for a lot of paleoclimate studies that<br>use ice<br>cores uh it starts to uh become a little<br>bit nonlinear when you get into the<br>higher mean annual air temperatures<br>because you're in the tropics where<br>temperature is less and important um but<br>at the the mid latitudes to the high<br>latitudes temperature is a strong<br>control on the oxygen isotopic values<br>this is just one example of the isotopic<br>effects that links Delta 18o for<br>temperature so you could see the utility<br>of this kind of right away imagine you<br>have an ice core that's a thousand years<br>old you can then measure the delta0 a<br>thousand years ago and have some<br>estimate of temperature when there were<br>no humans measuring<br>temperature so we can then then use this<br>relationship to make estimates of what<br>temperature was like in the<br>past um another isotope effect which is<br>important and I'll talk a little bit<br>more in the context of New Zealand is<br>what we call The Source effect and that<br>is that if you're at a particular<br>location in in you know on the land<br>surface where that moisture source is<br>coming from often has distinct isotopic<br>variations so if it's coming from the<br>Pacific Ocean versus the tasmin ocean<br>versus the Coral Sea for<br>example that moisture Source variation<br>will also be picked up at your<br>particular location so what you would do<br>to measure this is you measure rainfall<br>and oxygen isotope values in rainfall<br>and you can see okay well now we have a<br>different Source effect if we have an<br>ice core in one of these locations and<br>it's varying between very negative<br>values maybe that's a continental Source<br>if it's um very uh if they're higher<br>values then perhaps it's coming from a<br>more low latitude moisture source and<br>then you can see these variations<br>potentially over time we have<br>temperature effects we have Source<br>effects um and then we also have<br>seasonality effects so this just shows a<br>plot of monthly Delta 18o values for<br>several different sites um at the high<br>latitudes in the bottom this is 75<br>degrees north so probably Greenland I'm<br>guessing um no Northwest Territories in<br>Canada and so you see a large seasonal<br>cycle with higher values during the<br>summer and lower values during the<br>winter and then as you get more Oceanic<br>locations that seasonality starts to<br>flatten out a little bit and then warmer<br>locations like in the tropics it's<br>relatively flat as<br>well so when we're looking at<br>paleoclimate records they're always<br>capturing some sort of the seasonality<br>so an ice core is going to be biased<br>towards the winter because that's when<br>most of the snow falls um uh tree and uh<br>might be pulling moisture from spring<br>and summer right when they're growing<br>and putting on their um their cells<br>right so there's and then caves you have<br>to look at a cave by itself to know is<br>it getting mean annual or is it biased<br>to one season or another but this will<br>tell us something about um the oxygen<br>isotopic value as it relates to<br>Seasons okay so that that just gives a<br>very basic introduction of stable<br>isotopes<br>um in the hydrologic cycle now I'm going<br>to kind of narrow in with some more<br>specific examples about what we did here<br>in New Zealand and how we can uh use<br>this to understand the climate dynamics<br>of of of New Zealand itself okay so what<br>we did for this particular study is we<br>spread out over the the South Island um<br>and took riverwater samples so you can<br>see this is um Chris Moy and Christina<br>reelman from<br>otago um we most of the times just drop<br>the bucket off of bridges um when<br>feasible um and then other times we'll<br>just walk down to the River's Edge with<br>a bottle and scoop out some water you<br>don't need that much so we take anywhere<br>from 20 milliliters to 60 milliliters of<br>water um and we do this for Rivers all<br>over wide spatial variation so we get<br>all of the climatic gradients now for<br>this study we were focusing on usually<br>the smaller rivers and the reason is is<br>those smaller rivers are more locally<br>sourced so that the the climate at that<br>sample site is more related to the local<br>climate rather than some climate very<br>far away so some of the really big<br>iconic um rivers in New Zealand we<br>didn't sample those we just drove right<br>over them and kept on going uh the<br>reason is is they might be sourced from<br>the Southern Alps 300 kilometers away<br>right and so our sample location doesn't<br>tell us anything about that local<br>climate signal it's sourced from<br>somewhere Far Away by focusing on the<br>smaller Rivers we avoid that<br>problem we also avoid lakes or rivers<br>with reservoirs because that water can<br>evaporate which then changes the<br>isotopic<br>composition uh and just complicates our<br>lives so we just focus on very small<br>rivers that have little<br>evaporation then we gener then we run<br>the stable isotopes and we can correlate<br>them against all kinds of different<br>climatic um parameters and then do an<br>uncertainty analysis say well how good<br>are are our estimates and then we can<br>validate<br>them by looking at previous River<br>samples and estimate the values of those<br>and see how well we can reproduce<br>them okay so what we do is we bring the<br>waters back to the lab this was an old<br>way of doing it uh where we analyze the<br>samples on a tcea basically what it is<br>is you take your small little river<br>sample you heat it up to 1, 1400° C and<br>it<br>vaporizes and then you can<br>separate out the hydrogen gas and carbon<br>monoxide gas and then you can measure<br>hydrogen Isotopes and then oxygen<br>Isotopes um so this is kind of old way<br>of doing it um I have a new instrument<br>that's a called a a picaro laser spec<br>that's going to be installed and I hope<br>to take this tcea and drop it off the<br>roof of the building because it's<br>horrible it's so hard to work with um<br>but basically once you do that analysis<br>is that's when you get you know oxygen<br>isotopic value for all these different<br>Rivers uh so just some scenery photos<br>this was actually um from from this year<br>um so on the upper left this is Seb here<br>um risking his life over these railroad<br>tracks um to to get a water<br>sample um myself here I even got my<br>11-year-old daughter to collect samples<br>for me um Chris and Christina so it just<br>kind of shows you the types of rivers<br>that we're going to I like to say that<br>this is really a study of the streams<br>creeks and burns of New Zealand right<br>because almost all of the sample names<br>are streams creeks and burns there's a<br>couple Rivers here and there but rivers<br>are usually reserved for those those<br>larger ones um so I'd say most of the<br>time we're doing these hand samples and<br>that simplifies our our life a little<br>bit because when you use that bucket um<br>you have to sterilize it after every<br>sample so you don't add contamination or<br>contamination so we always try to get<br>the hand samples whenever possible uh<br>which is usually um it's usually<br>possible maybe 80% I estimate of of our<br>recent samples are just from walking<br>river um so then you end up with you<br>know a pretty wide distribution of these<br>different rivers and you end up with<br>your sample bottles here so we've now uh<br>for the the original study we had 193<br>samples for our current study we're at<br>sample number 300 something and<br>continuing um so we're sampling all<br>these all over the place and I like to<br>show this image the wal River because<br>now we can also link these isotopic<br>values to things like wine production<br>Etc this is where you get into the<br>climatic<br>forensics so I bought this bottle of<br>wine a couple weeks ago because I saw<br>that it was one of my sample sites you<br>see the little bottle there says the wal<br>River<br>okay so let's get into the actual<br>science here this is a a map uh showing<br>the digital elevation model so just<br>altitude for for reference there and<br>then all of the blue dots are the river<br>samples that we that we collected on the<br>south island I think yeah we had 16 days<br>and we just basically drove around the<br>South Island non-stop collecting River<br>samples you wake up at sunrise you drive<br>to a river you collect it and then you<br>drive to the next River you collect it<br>you do that until Sunset and then you<br>sleep in a hotel and then you keep on<br>going until youve covered as much as you<br>can um so on average it was roughly<br>5,500 kilometers of<br>driving uh the cyan spots are<br>precipitation isotope stations which are<br>useful for us um being able to ascertain<br>how well The isotopic Valleys in the<br>rivers are related to the<br>rainfall um so you can see we have<br>samples pretty much everywhere there are<br>roads um on the South Island um with the<br>exception of Kora because uh right in<br>our sampling campaign is when they had<br>the big earthquake in 2016 and all the<br>roads were closed so that's our big gap<br>we have it from<br>2024 so we go to really colorful places<br>like roaring swine Creek and I love how<br>the rivers almost always have these<br>yellow signs with the names here um so<br>I'm just showing you some of the is to<br>values that was - 7 per<br>Mill uh the fox Glacier Outlet River was<br>minus 9.7 per mil the Polaris river<br>which is up by Nelson isus 6.4<br>perm the tasmin river minus 9.6 was so<br>that's just on the other side of the fox<br>Glacier so they have essentially<br>identical samples sample values it's<br>because they're both being sourced from<br>Ice that's just flowing in different<br>directions<br>and we even did the space Brewery spring<br>tap just for fun minus 6.4 per Mill<br>that's down by dun Eden and its value is<br>similar to all the rivers around dun<br>Eden as well too uh but it also does<br>show you some implications if you want<br>to measure stable isotopes in beer you<br>can right and it'll tell you more or<br>less the geographic origin of the water<br>that was used to create that<br>beer Okay so 193 River samples 193 data<br>points making sense of it all what does<br>all of this mean this is the real<br>question right so you have this messy<br>set of um vials how do we put it into<br>some sort of order that we're<br>understanding what's going on and<br>coincidentally U the picture on the<br>right I took first and then I<br>accidentally knocked them all over and I<br>was like oh this is a teachable moment<br>right here so it's like playing dominoes<br>but how do we make sense of at all what<br>what's controlling these isotopic<br>variations and then what can we do with<br>that information so the first thing we<br>did is we just you know ploted them up<br>again this is this map is the digital<br>elevation model so you can kind of just<br>ignore those colors but each one of the<br>circles here represents the stable<br>isotopic value of the river at that<br>particular<br>location and the color scale here is<br>blue um represents the higher value so<br>that would be minus four to minus5 per<br>Mill the the red has the much more<br>negative values minus 12-<br>13 so what you can see is like all along<br>the tasmin coast you're mainly looking<br>at Blues shades of<br>blue um once you start getting a little<br>bit more away from the tasmin coast<br>Inland they start to turn yellow and<br>green until finally you get around<br>central otago the Lakes District where a<br>lot of the values are red so and then<br>you move closer to the Pacific coast and<br>they start getting blue and green again<br>so you can start to see that there's<br>actually a a spatial variation in the<br>isotopic values you can only have<br>that if there's a climatic control on<br>the stab isotopic values if it were just<br>random noise you wouldn't see any<br>pattern at all so we already have some<br>indication that there's some clear<br>spatial variation here that can help us<br>understand um you know what's<br>controlling that so then we look at the<br>tiny Dots here the very small cyan those<br>are climate<br>stations and those are U allowing us to<br>look at the climate parameters over this<br>over these over this area here and then<br>that's what we can use to build our<br>regression models to find out what's<br>controlling these<br>values okay so these are just our<br>measured values nothing interpolated no<br>no statistics here it's just this is<br>what we measure this is what we<br>observed another thing that we were<br>always curious to look at here is<br>whether the river waters have been<br>affected by evaporation I mentioned<br>before if you have lakes they evaporate<br>and that changes the oxygen isotopic<br>variation and then we don't want those<br>values because it'll it'll tell you<br>something about evaporation at a lake<br>that's not necessarily related to The<br>Climate one way to assess that is by<br>making a a line plot between oxygen<br>Isotopes and hydrogen Isotopes is called<br>the the the water<br>line um the gmwl is called the Global<br>meteoric water line and that is the line<br>that defines the oxygen and hydrogen<br>isotopic values for rainfall across the<br>entire<br>Globe um and then so what we did is we<br>plotted all of our data against this<br>Global meteoric water line and it fit<br>almost precisely which is telling us<br>that evaporation is not controlling any<br>of our River sample isotopic values and<br>we expected that number one because New<br>Zealand to happens to be a very wet<br>location um number two um uh we avoided<br>rivers that were coming from Lakes<br>there's just a couple of cases where we<br>took lakes lake alexandrina we measured<br>because Chris was interested and it was<br>very evaporative as we just threw that<br>sample<br>up this is important because it<br>represents um essentially equilibrium in<br>our in our isotopic value so we know<br>that there's not secondary processes<br>unrelated to climate that's controlling<br>okay so let's start talking about some<br>of the the what we learned from this um<br>the the first thing that I wanted to<br>point out is we see that there's a clear<br>altitude effect the higher the altitude<br>the more negative the values so if you<br>look at this by variant plot oxygen<br>Isotopes on the y axis and then<br>catchment altitude on the x-axis you can<br>see as you get higher um altitudes the<br>Delta no values are more negative and<br>you kind of expect that because it's<br>colder at higher altitudes but the<br>Curious Thing that we saw is that<br>there's a real distinction between the<br>Tasman slope which is in<br>blue and the Pacific slope which is in<br>Red so they both had very similar slopes<br>of that relationship but they're offset<br>from each other that tells us something<br>really important it tells us that the<br>moisture sources from locations east of<br>the Southern Alps is mostly coming from<br>the Pacific Ocean and<br>um west of the Southern Alps are mainly<br>coming from the tasmin sea so that's now<br>we're learning something about the<br>climatic dynamics of the South Island<br>here and it's also telling us that<br>temperature is a strong control we<br>already kind of know that from general<br>principles but this confirms<br>that okay so that's just one example of<br>how you can do a correlation between a a<br>physiographic parameter in this case<br>altitude which is strongly related to<br>well there's a lot of other climate<br>parameters that could potentially be<br>important so kind of we we generated<br>this really large data set of all the<br>different climatic parameters and we<br>estimated that for every sample<br>location um so for example you can look<br>at annual mean temperature mean annual<br>rainfall wind speed vapor pressure<br>temperature solar radiation annual<br>precipitation the list goes on and on of<br>different climatic parameters and so we<br>ended up assembling this Matrix of 117<br>different climate<br>variables and some of those were very<br>similar like June maximum temperature<br>and then July maximum temperature August<br>maximum temperature Etc so you end up<br>with this very large Matrix but then we<br>have this large Matrix and we can ask<br>ourselves well what are the climate<br>Isotopes so um this just shows some<br>examples um from this data set that's<br>it's called the bioclim data set that's<br>based on all of these wh white dots here<br>um from the New Zealand climate stations<br>um and it's in each one of these graphs<br>it's Delta 0 plotted up against one of<br>these different variables so where it<br>looks like a more<br>linear um fit it's a stronger fit when<br>it just looks like a cloud of data it's<br>telling you that that parameter is not<br>controlling uh the isotopic value at all<br>so there's a kind of a couple that stand<br>out out um the first one the top left is<br>just Delta 180 versus delta 180 so<br>ignore that um but the third one from<br>the left on the top row that's the mean<br>dial range in temperature right that has<br>a pretty linear slope um minimum<br>temperature of the coldest month has a<br>pretty linear slope um the temperature<br>annual range has a pretty linear slope<br>but then when you get into parameters<br>like mean temperature of the warmest<br>quarter it's just a scatter shot there's<br>no relationship at all so visually you<br>can start to see that yes there some of<br>these parameters are important for<br>controlling the Isotopes and some of<br>them are<br>not so this is a relatively small Matrix<br>of you know let's see one<br>two 23 different variables but we<br>actually had 117 different variables<br>that we can make these correlations<br>against so this just shows the<br>correlation Matrix every parameter 177<br>correlated against the other 177<br>including Delta 18l right so you<br>generate this very large data set that's<br>the only reason I wanted to show this is<br>that is it allows us to get very precise<br>with the climate parameters and then you<br>come up with a correlation coefficient<br>and a statistical significance so you<br>can find out which ones are really<br>important so this is too complicated if<br>we want to make sense of this we have to<br>simplify this<br>somehow all right so keeping it simple<br>what we want to do is we want to take<br>those 117 different variables and then<br>ones we can do that um ourselves based<br>on expert opinion say okay well here's<br>the ones that I think are important or<br>we can let a statistical model do it<br>itself so we kind of did<br>both um and to illustrate this um I I<br>took just a subset of the data it's<br>basically this this transect that goes<br>from the catlins through dun Eden up to<br>kind of the central um the central<br>tasmin coast and the nice thing about<br>this transect um shown in the inset map<br>here is that it isolates latitude as one<br>of those potential<br>variables and it just gives you a nice<br>geographic representation so this very<br>bottom plot is the altitude of that<br>transect more or less going from the<br>south to the north and you can see you<br>know you cross uh no actually it's going<br>from north to south you cross the<br>Southern Alps you go over several other<br>different ranges and then over to the<br>Pacific<br>Ocean um and then you see that there's<br>pretty clear variations in temperature<br>annual range on the top plot lowest<br>values on the Inland Lo or sorry um the<br>temperature annual range you have the<br>greatest range of temperatures in Inland<br>otago the coasts have less range because<br>they're offered by the heat capacity of<br>the<br>ocean um this next graph in in light<br>blue is December potential evapo<br>transpiration which is much higher in<br>central otago it's plotted with the<br>Reversed axis<br>here um minimum temperature in<br>July so winter temperature is much<br>colder in the in the Inland locations<br>and then in the dark blue are are Delta<br>h0 values of those Rivers so you can see<br>that there's a very clear spatial<br>structure here you start off with values<br>on the tasmin coast of around minus 6<br>perm they decrease as you go over the<br>Southern Alps they're lowest in the Lee<br>of the Southern Alps not on the Southern<br>Alps but in the Lee of the Southern Alps<br>and then they start to increase again<br>towards the Pacific Ocean right so this<br>is just showing you that there's a clear<br>spatial variation here so we could make<br>a model for example that says well<br>temperature annual range does a really<br>good job of predicting the Delta 80<br>values the r value is 0.77 which is a<br>good strong correlation for climate<br>science or we could say potentially EV<br>vaporal transpiration in the summer in<br>December is a really strong um<br>correlation or minimum temperature in<br>July is a really strong correlation Etc<br>so you can start to visualize this yes<br>that there are relationships between<br>parameters um we can also ask oursel the<br>question is well what months seem to be<br>most strongly correlated to the oxygen<br>isoil values so we have these climate<br>variables for every month right so we<br>can say is it winter or is it summer is<br>it Autumn is it spring you know which<br>season seems to be most strongly<br>correlated to the oxygen isotopic values<br>U and it turns out that it's winter<br>right when you look at the the strongest<br>correlations they're usually associated<br>with winter climate<br>parameters this is telling us that<br>winter seems to be the most important<br>season for explaining the isotopic<br>values when we collected these samples<br>which actually happened to be in<br>November of 2016 so it's kind of an<br>early summer signal but the winter is<br>the climate parameters that are most<br>relevant to those stabil Isotopes so I'm<br>not going to get into too much detail<br>but this plot it's just showing you the<br>correlation strength so whenever you get<br>into the winter months June and July<br>that's when you tend to see the<br>parameters okay so that helps us now<br>quantify some of this as well too like<br>if we wanted to say what's the<br>relationship between temperature and<br>July and Delta 180 then we can put a<br>number on<br>that and that turns out to be about 0.6<br>to 0.8 per<br>okay but then what we did even further<br>we take this 177 variables a lot of<br>those variables are telling you the same<br>thing like July temperature and June<br>temperature are telling you essentially<br>the same thing because they're<br>correlated to each other so we had to<br>use the statistical model that basically<br>says okay let's just pick the<br>strongest controls or the strongest<br>correlations and let's pick three or<br>four or five or whatever of them and<br>combine them all together making sure<br>that the variables that choose are<br>themselves not correlated to each other<br>so for example you don't want to have um<br>July minimum temperature and June<br>minimum temp temperature in your final<br>equation because they're basically<br>showing you the same thing so what this<br>uh set of graphs does um is it shows you<br>our overall model on the far left so we<br>have measured values on the Y AIS that's<br>what we actually measured for those 193<br>samples and then the modeled values<br>um you can see there's a very strong<br>correlation in fact the R value the the<br>strength of that correlation is<br>0.88 again for climate variables that's<br>considered a very strong<br>correlation but which are the main<br>variables that went up to make this<br>regression model so the the model kind<br>of chooses it these itself because it<br>says okay I'm only going to choose the<br>strongest uh the strongest set of<br>variables that are all not related to<br>each other and so we just let the model<br>choose here and it chose um temperature<br>minimum temperature of the coldest<br>month evapo transpiration in December so<br>in the<br>summer um surface radiation or yes solar<br>radiation so how sunny that particular<br>location is and then latitude and then<br>you can come up with an equation that<br>relates Delta to know all those<br>different<br>parameters so that gives us a way to<br>predict and it also gives us a way to<br>predict potentially into the future when<br>temperature of the coldest month might<br>change due to global warming or<br>something like that so rather than just<br>cing our data or making a spatial map<br>and contouring it this gives us<br>predictive value in case any of those<br>variables change so we just let the<br>model do this um and I'm just going to<br>go back for a second here so these maps<br>on the right actually show you those<br>climate variables over space so you can<br>start off with with these maps and then<br>it's just manipulating the maps in terms<br>of the algebra so we have a map of every<br>one of these different climate variables<br>and so we can say okay we know based on<br>our our equation<br>here which are the ones we want to<br>choose then we just do Algebra on the<br>maaps right and we can then combine<br>these all together to produce that final<br>isoscape right so this isoscape right<br>variables so we just combine them all<br>together and then it'll give us a<br>predicted isoscape you know for that uh<br>for that set of data and so you can see<br>it it fits with what we had originally<br>done which is showing the the circles<br>for each of our values in terms of the<br>colors is that you have this swath of<br>blue along the tasmin sea and it turns<br>out that Latitude is not that important<br>fjordland has more less the same values<br>as Abel tasmin way up in the Northwest<br>right so this the rivers are pretty<br>consistently um giving that same signal<br>along the tasmin sea then the values<br>start to decrease they get more green<br>and red when you hit the Southern Alps<br>the peaks of the Southern Alps and then<br>they go really negative in the in the<br>Lakes District around<br>otago and then once you get closer to<br>the coast they start to get more green<br>and blue again<br>so this is showing you know this is<br>showing us<br>that the minimum values are really in<br>Central atago and if you've ever been to<br>Central otago there's a couple things<br>that stand out to you in terms of the<br>landscapes in terms of the climate it's<br>one of the driest places in the South<br>Island it's one of the coldest places in<br>Winter because it's isolated from the<br>oceans these are related to continents<br>ality we don't think of continentality<br>as being a big issue in an island but it<br>turns out that if you're looking for the<br>most continental location in the south<br>island of New Zealand is going to be<br>right around Central otaga and that's<br>also where we see the most negative<br>Delta h o values so we can kind of zoom<br>out here a little bit and say well all<br>of these different climate parameters of<br>in this model those four different ones<br>they're all pretty much relating to<br>continentality and what it means<br>essentially is is that the most negative<br>values are in the coldest areas in<br>central otago that are most distant from<br>the moisture sources of the tasmin and<br>Ocean so this map is publicly available<br>you can pull it into a GIS click on any<br>grid cell and it will tell you the<br>estimated deltate Ino value of a river<br>if it were a small River Basin from that<br>location okay so when we produced this<br>we submitted our paper um the reviewers<br>were really critical of a lot of the<br>things that we did and they said well<br>one of the things you're missing here is<br>seasonality like these rivers are<br>probably changing from winter to summer<br>and you just have a spot sample right<br>they can be affected by weather that's<br>not related to The Climate means all<br>kinds of different things so we we<br>wanted to ask a bunch of questions about<br>how representative our data were for<br>explaining kind of these spatial<br>patterns for in other words is this map<br>only useful for November of 2016 when we<br>collected the samples or does it have<br>some broader use as a climate variable<br>as a climate<br>space and without doing these tests we<br>don't really know so the reviewers<br>really pushed us hard on this and said<br>okay well you really need to assess this<br>otherwise we don't know if you're just<br>looking at some random pattern that<br>showed up once and might not ever show<br>up again so we did uncertainty analysis<br>um and a couple ways there's a bunch of<br>different ways you can do this but one<br>way is saying okay let's take 193<br>samples and let's run our regression<br>model on 80% of the data and then<br>estimate the remaining 20% and compare<br>them how well did it compare those those<br>samples that we left out so that's<br>called what a jack knife approach so we<br>ran this model a thousand times each<br>time leaving out a different 20% of the<br>samples you know and we can estimate how<br>good our data is in explaining our own<br>data and it's pretty good um we're<br>usually within one per Mill which is<br>pretty<br>good but that doesn't tell us a whole<br>lot because it's using our own data set<br>to estimate our own data set it's better<br>if we have independent<br>data um actually before I get to that<br>I'm just going to go back for a second<br>this maybe was a little bit out of out<br>of place um so this map here basically<br>shows our interpretation of what's<br>Happening you know with the moisture<br>sources here the Southern Alps are<br>blocking most of the tasmin moisture and<br>the other ranges are also blocking the<br>Pacific Ocean easterly and that's why we<br>get the most negative values in the<br>Zealand um okay<br>so to summarize that spatial variation<br>you get Wester leav from the<br>tasmin coming in highest values they get<br>more and more negative as you get more<br>distant from the moisture source in the<br>rain shadow we call the isotopic rain<br>Pacific now what did we learn kind of<br>from this basic process here we learned<br>that winter temperature and<br>continentality are really the most<br>important controls and that we have this<br>these really negative isotopic values in<br>the Lee of the Southern elps I'll also<br>emphasize that we didn't sample many<br>glacierized catchments we tried to avoid<br>the ones you know that had glaciers in<br>the headat because that could be very<br>old water we had a couple here and then<br>but for the most part<br>not um and then that also means that if<br>you're working with isotopic proxy data<br>like in<br>lakes or in caves it should be<br>temperature um so this gets back a<br>little bit more to testing um testing<br>our data against other independent<br>sources so there's this um Source called<br>the oxygen Isotopes and precipitation<br>calculator which is shown in this graph<br>on the left and that kind of makes an<br>estimate for the whole earth all of Glo<br>all of the globe you and I just isolated<br>um New Zealand here and so I said okay<br>well how well does this isoscape work<br>for New Zealand and it turns out it<br>doesn't work very well because they<br>didn't have much data to input into it<br>so just one example here's um luget<br>Creek is near Wan we measured a Delta h0<br>value minus roughly minus 13 per M this<br>oipc map suggests it should be around<br>minus um 9 or minus 10 per so it's not<br>even<br>close our isoscape estimates it as minus<br>12.7 right so using our data to<br>interpret our data it's very good as you<br>would<br>expect all right so so this map is not<br>very useful the oipc map is not very<br>useful for New Zealand and the reason<br>that's important in my opinion is a lot<br>of people use this because they don't<br>have their own data and say well we'll<br>just use this o IPC map and make them an<br>estimate but I'd say don't do it not for<br>New Zealand because there's not enough<br>data here um there's also a pre<br>precipitation isotope map for New<br>Zealand from uh bason at all I'm not<br>sure if I'm pronouncing that right if<br>I'm not sorry and that's a physically<br>based precipitation isoscape shown on<br>the left here compared to ours now they<br>they reverse their color scale um but it<br>basically shows the same thing where<br>there's more negative values in central<br>otago so we can you know look at lug at<br>Creek again you know just that one<br>example um it's hard to tell exactly<br>from that precipitation map because the<br>the data aren't available for me to you<br>know click a grid cell but it looks like<br>it's around minus 10 to 11 per Mill and<br>we measured minus 13 so again it's<br>um another way we did this to is using<br>our data to kind of retrospectively<br>predict values that were measured back<br>in the 1970s and 1980s by Stuart at all<br>so this was a really great study where<br>they published a couple hundred rivers<br>on the North and the South Island we say<br>hey great we sampled some of those same<br>Rivers how well does our isoscape<br>predict the values that were measured 30<br>years ago if our isoscape is just kind<br>of random weather noise you would expect<br>there would be no relationship at all so<br>we found 30 years or sorry um uh we I<br>don't remember how many rivers it was it<br>was it was roughly 30 or 40 different<br>rivers that we both sampled the steward<br>at all and<br>us and we've got more than 30 years 35<br>years of time difference here and it<br>turns out that the mean difference<br>between our<br>isoscape and their values was plus or<br>minus or was 0.09 per mil difference so<br>essentially identical plus or minus 68<br>per mil so what this tells us is that<br>this isoscape is really reflecting some<br>mean and it's useful for predicting<br>values that were meas measured 30 years<br>ago right so it's just more validation<br>that the river values that we're<br>measuring today are are a real climate<br>signal<br>there's no other way to explain<br>this um another thing that we did is we<br>said okay well presumably it's rainfall<br>that's making the river water so how<br>well can our River isoscape predict the<br>Delta 180 values of rainfall we're kind<br>of inverting this process right because<br>usually it's the rain that makes the<br>rivers we're saying if we know the<br>rivers how well can we predict the<br>rainfall um and so we can do a measured<br>versus predicted model and again again<br>we're within one per Mill uh when we<br>look at um when we look at either um<br>winter weighted average rainfall versus<br>our isoscape um or just me annual<br>rainfall we do a pretty good job within<br>one per Mill we can predict what the<br>rainfall value will be just from our<br>River isoscape again this is not<br>possible unless that our unless that<br>River isoscape has really given us um a<br>climate signal rather than a weather<br>signal or some kind of random<br>signal so I feel like we have some<br>pretty good confidence in this approach<br>but there's still a lot of uncertainties<br>I'll get to that in a second so let's<br>just step back for a second and say what<br>did we learned from all this and why is<br>it important well we learned that<br>there's a clear spatial variation on the<br>south island we learned that oxygen sub<br>values are strongly correlated to<br>continentality and winter temperature<br>um the spatial variations are likely a<br>robust and real climate signal and<br>they're reflecting the climatic<br>processes that are producing the<br>rainfall that's then flowing into the<br>rivers rainfall and snowfall um and then<br>we can use these isoscapes in a lot of<br>other disciplines and this is where I<br>think it becomes really<br>interesting um so what are some of the<br>broader impacts of this so one of them<br>is in terms of geology there's a really<br>important paper that was was published<br>in 1999 by Chamberlain at all and what<br>they did is they went in these sites in<br>central tago around Alexandria and they<br>looked at the hydrogen isotopic value of<br>cholite Clays and they were able to show<br>that over roughly 3 to seven million<br>years or so the isotopic value of those<br>Clays had changed and they interpreted<br>it as the uplift of the Southern Alps so<br>when the Southern Alps Rose it changed<br>the isotopic composition in this<br>location so they able to show you know<br>using clay isotopes that they can do<br>something really powerful with that and<br>say well actually we can estimate that<br>we can estimate the um the Delta value<br>the Delta h no values of Clays so this<br>is simply my isoscape model run through<br>an equation that ENC converts them into<br>the clay isotope<br>values so assuming that those Clays are<br>formed with the the same source of the<br>water that's in the river you can now<br>say hey if you find a clay it's going to<br>have its most its lowest values in<br>central tago and the highest values on<br>the coast so this is useful for Geology<br>looking at uplift of the Southern<br>Alps and they happen to sample exactly<br>the right spot because that's where the<br>biggest isotopic differences is right<br>where they<br>sample um another way we can use this is<br>by looking at caves so again this is<br>this this is the river isotope map<br>converted into the oxygen isotope value<br>of Cal sites that would precipitate in a<br>cave at equilibrium so you have to know<br>something about temperature as well too<br>so we took the temperature<br>field an equation that relates oxygen<br>Isotopes in water to calite so if you<br>find a spel them a cave caly you don't<br>know where it came from you can start to<br>use the oxygen isotopic values in this<br>map to try to pinpoint where it might<br>have come from right so this is just one<br>example of how you can use<br>this um another example is um looking at<br>Organics Leaf waxes so if you have um<br>plants growing along a river that are<br>pulling in that river water they die the<br>leaf waxes end up in a lake sediment<br>core somewhere well then that's going to<br>also be related to this so this is a map<br>of of um dyum not in leaf waxes but dyum<br>the hydrogen Isotopes over over New<br>Zealand which then you could convert<br>into a leaf waxd<br>um another impact is you can use bird<br>feathers hydrogen Isotopes and bird<br>feathers so we all know the Kiwi right<br>and all these other things we can figure<br>out if you have a kiwi feather you can<br>estimate where it could have come from<br>Based On A bird feather me so again use<br>the same isoscape an equation that<br>relates feather hydrogen Isotopes to<br>water hydrogen Isotopes and then boom<br>there you go right so the kiwis coming<br>from the tasmin coast are going to have<br>higher values the kiwis coming from the<br>Cent central otago region are going to<br>have lower values you can start to see<br>this as useful in biof<br>forensics you can do the same thing for<br>sheep's wool make maps of the uh<br>wool you can do it for human hair if<br>you're dealing with archaeological<br>context or God forbid murder victims<br>right if you want to know where they<br>were living when their hair was growing<br>that's going to be reflected in the<br>stable isotopes of the hair or in the<br>tooth carbonate in the skull right when<br>you grow your teeth it's equilibrated<br>with the water source that you're using<br>so these are just all maps that you can<br>produce here just by some s relatively<br>simple equations that have a lot of<br>applicability in other other<br>fields um and then we can look at time<br>series of paleoclimate Records so this<br>is a SPM composite that came out um a<br>couple years ago Adam is on this paper<br>um and uh help us interpret you know the<br>oxygen isotopic values over time and you<br>can see that they're changing you have<br>this broad scale change over the last<br>12,000 years or<br>so so we can interpret the more negative<br>values as being either colder or more<br>winter<br>moisture the higher values is being a<br>little bit warmer or less winter<br>moisture based on what we know from the<br>isoscapes and the correlations between<br>Delta and<br>temperature right so that just gives<br>some idea of the utility of this type of<br>work there's still a lot of un<br>unanswered questions and that's where I<br>get to kind of the ongoing work um so<br>I've been um I've been here since<br>January driving around um so far about<br>13,000 kilometers of driving um with Seb<br>and some other people um sampling River<br>so this is what we've manage to sample<br>just um since<br>January we're pretty much done um but<br>we're going to be going back to the<br>South Island um two weeks and doing one<br>more kind of repeat sampling so we're<br>trying to do at least at least half of<br>the samples repeated so we have values<br>for example in March and then again in<br>May and values that we did in April and<br>again in June just to see if there's any<br>seasonal<br>variation um and the idea is we're going<br>to try to do some more sophisticated<br>statistics that can also relate not just<br>the sample location<br>isotope or Val climate parameters but<br>the drainage basin parameters so that<br>inset map shows you it's kind of hard to<br>see here but it shows you the drainage<br>basins above our sample sites so from<br>there you can actually say okay what's<br>the mean annual temperature for that<br>entire drainage basin not just where we<br>sampled right so we can get a better<br>spatial<br>representation um with this future data<br>set um we're also going to be using the<br>more up-to-date Nea coverages for the<br>client here rather than the bioclim data<br>set which is more Global lacked some of<br>the the local<br>expertise so this is really what's to<br>come in in this particular project once<br>I get back to my lab um in July um I'll<br>start I'll start analyzing the second<br>batch and we'll move on to see what else<br>we learn there's also another<br>differences that we're sampling at the<br>end of the summer and into the Autumn<br>compared to early summer from 2016 and<br>we're repeating a lot of the same Rivers<br>so we'll have kind of Same Same Rivers<br>over time to see how much they vary and<br>one of the things I'll do is I'll take<br>my isoscape and predict the 2024 samples<br>right I'll do that before and I'll see<br>how good I am see how good our data is<br>for doing that<br>prediction okay so I'm pretty much<br>wrapping up here um the conclusions I've<br>already said um several times and you<br>know looking to the Future that's just<br>what we're doing now um so I think I'll<br>just wrap it up there and say thank you<br>attention any questions um online or in<br>the<br>the go into the<br>workplace should be able to change so<br>you should be able to view the um<br>here's<br>chat okay<br>talk I'm either doing something wrong or<br>I'm not seeing anything okay he's typing<br>yeah yeah we're not hearing any audio<br>one while we Wai that's okay um maybe<br>maybe you explained it and I missed it<br>um so with your multiple regression<br>model uh your different climate<br>variables um some of the most important<br>one seem to<br>have summary statistic reflects slightly<br>different season depending on what<br>summary statistic you're looking at for<br>those variables right it was a December<br>value I can't remember exactly for what<br>it was and some other seasons in there<br>so how e or how difficult is to actually<br>untangle the actual underlying<br>mechanisms of those variables<br>influencing the isop value what's the<br>process<br>governing you know the is values that<br>are reflected in these<br>different clim of VAR right so the the<br>question was was basically um in our<br>multiple regression model we had a<br>couple of winter proxies and then one<br>summer proxy and then latitude right so<br>how do we untangle which of those is the<br>potentially the most important or how<br>it's controlled there and how do we kind<br>of deal with the seasonality so the the<br>summer proxy was evapo transpiration<br>which is an indicator of continentality<br>so I would say in that case um we're<br>really seeing um that the central otago<br>region is just has a more Contin<br>continental climate and that's why the<br>Delta no values are lower it's not that<br>necessarily the summer you app<br>transformation is controlling the value<br>it's that it's itself a stand in for the<br>the sources of moisture that have to be<br>coming from the<br>oceans um but to go further is you can<br>you know you can isolate single<br>variables as well too you could just say<br>well what's the correlation between<br>delta8 and0 and uh you know a single<br>variable and then you'll end up with<br>that the the statistical model just<br>gives you a little bit of extra better<br>fitting when you combine multiple values<br>at a time which is why we went with that<br>U and and so I I would conclude that<br>it's almost primarily continentality<br>that's really controlling this rather<br>than those individual factors in the<br>summer okay good question okay so um oh<br>awesome Alice is here<br>yeah okay so<br>um so the question is how can your<br>sampling Aid development of our<br>precipitation model oh this is Bruce<br>awesome glad you're here we're having<br>trouble replicating orographic effects<br>and the East West patterns across the<br>Southern Alps small streams seem<br>potentially<br>useful um yeah I would agree um ideally<br>you know when we have a<br>precipitation model we'd like to have a<br>a very high density of sample sites but<br>that's very difficult to do because it's<br>so time consuming to set up all these<br>different<br>um precipitation sampling collections<br>everywhere and that was one of the<br>motivations for doing our study is we<br>felt well it's difficult for us to<br>constrain um precipitation ourselves<br>because it's so timec consuming why<br>don't we substitute space for time um<br>and I think in in this case um in this<br>case Bruce that I think we should you<br>know use use your River model and um the<br>precipitation model model and and use<br>our data just to see how well they<br>compare and then the idea would be to<br>look at the residuals between the two<br>and ask ourselves ask ourselves the<br>question of whether or not there's<br>something we can do to um better<br>interpolate the precipitation isoscape<br>model where there aren't stations I<br>think um I wish we had audio so we could<br>turn this into a conversation but I<br>don't think we have that so anyways I<br>hope we can talk some more Bruce about<br>this and and and get exactly at this<br>question so if you if you have a maybe a<br>followup question go ahead and write it<br>in there or any observations of your own<br>and I'll move on to Alice's question um<br>yeah so Alice is also involved with this<br>um in this project um Alice is at Nea in<br>Nelson um and she sampled some of these<br>Rivers as well too so the elephant in<br>the room with New Zealand is<br>characterizing the influence of moisture<br>source of direction for example the<br>North Westerly for this versus the<br>southernly and they have different<br>isotopic<br>signatures how to incorporate that into<br>predictions since it's not part of the<br>large climate data sets that are<br>typically used as<br>predictors yeah this is a really tough<br>question so basically the question is if<br>you have different moisture sources how<br>would you know it if you only have um if<br>you only have one or two samples from a<br>particular<br>location um repeat samp is what we<br>really need here um and I think the<br>approach that I would like to see is<br>um really doing the back trajectory<br>analysis on event based<br>sampling um and I'm not sure to what<br>extent that's been done in the<br>precipitation data sets uh but I think<br>that would be the the nice place to<br>really move next um for making this<br>question and and looking at the relative<br>proportions of the different moisture<br>sources is the rivers are going to be<br>integrating over time and so we can't do<br>that very easily unless we're going out<br>to the same rivers over time every<br>couple of weeks or something it's a very<br>good question I know that we're going to<br>conversations yeah and then Bruce is<br>saying the river model is currently<br>using the the Bas and precept model as<br>input and it does need some updating I<br>think we can do this multiple regression<br>model on the based in precipitation<br>isotope data too you know and maybe get<br>some more Ables in there and maybe maybe<br>that will improve it for the for the New<br>good okay see a couple others um say<br>Thomas said there a there are a few time<br>series data sets for the water Isotopes<br>monthly or a year or so did you manage<br>to track down anything useful we didn't<br>look that in much detail the only<br>question we really had uh with that was<br>how much seasonality there was in the<br>the river isotope data sets that we saw<br>but I didn't personally go into into<br>detail about the precipitation Isotopes<br>or other people's data sets at least not<br>yet but we did see that in many cases<br>the seasonal cycle is relatively small<br>um for most of the places that we looked<br>uh but we really need to look in places<br>like Central aago more to see how much<br>variation there is on a seasonal<br>basis and then Simon says great talk<br>thank<br>you uh interesting that you didn't<br>include<br>altitude would it be possible to include<br>Max altitude between sight and<br>Coast um in the model so yeah this is<br>the thing the model we can actually<br>force it to put in the variables we want<br>or we can let the model choose it itself<br>we thought in this paper we would let<br>the model choose it itself so that there<br>wasn't bias in there but yes we can we<br>can do that we can choose any model any<br>parameter that we want and come up with<br>a a<br>different a different um a different<br>model what happens if I do okay try<br>speaking slon no it doesn't work uh<br>me we I can hear you Simon but it<br>through yeah sorry folks we do not have<br>audio we could have we could be having<br>our offline conversation here it sounds<br>like yeah I like<br>that we could decide what to type in<br>together yeah yeah I've got so many<br>questions about this okayy we can hear<br>you now<br>oh yeah have a volume<br>knob so um be I guess maybe before we go<br>to that if anyone in the room wants to<br>leave feel free to leave you don't need<br>to stick around for this sometimes uh<br>these can go on forever but it's gonna<br>get yeah yeah go ahead if you wanna if<br>now um yeah I I guess I<br>um I had a a few things that immediately<br>sprang to mind uh one is that I've just<br>done the code for one of the steps that<br>you've suggested which was to calculate<br>the um the climate uh for each River<br>Basin uh I've written it up an r and I'm<br>happy to share um you just need the new<br>uh boundaries<br>um as input and you could uh Crank that<br>out oh yeah I don't know how to do that<br>yet oh no I've just love to talk with<br>you about it I all I all I've done so<br>far is generate the polygon well that's<br>all that's all you need uh and the rest<br>of it's done okay that was one thing um<br>the the second is we we are still<br>struggling with we we are interested in<br>the big rivers and we're interested in<br>differences between the isotope values<br>of the big rivers and the isotope values<br>of the precipitation in their catchments<br>which is why I've just done that that<br>code that I was describing yeah we're<br>still having troubles with the uh the<br>precipitation and particularly I think<br>getting the high elevation precipitation<br>isotope values and amounts right and it<br>strikes me that the um high elevation<br>small River<br>could be really useful for correcting at<br>least the isotope component of that<br>precipitation model and it may be that<br>you know we we need to look at um<br>differences you know that would be<br>really good to be able to look at<br>differences in our model between what we<br>are predicting in the isotope values of<br>precipitation at high elevations and and<br>either side of the Alps with what you're<br>getting for those for those uh small<br>rivers and and that could really help us<br>yeah I think think this would be a great<br>project for a student to some extent<br>because we we're limited to the road<br>Network which actually doesn't get that<br>high in most parts that's part of the<br>problem you know just going over the<br>passes you you get a somewhat high but I<br>think really what you would need is you<br>know somebody to hike up into these<br>higher catchments<br>right there's been some hiking done<br>Alice I was I was just gonna say I mean<br>we have we have over 100 snow samples<br>from various places in Alpine locations<br>it might be an interesting exercise to<br>compare the isotope values of those snow<br>samples to nearby your nearest Headwater<br>catchments to see how representative<br>they are of those higher Alpine areas I<br>guess the challenge here is that like<br>snow pack I mean as you know like the um<br>isotope values change as snow is<br>susceptible to turbulent fluxes and so I<br>I guess that that's kind of the<br>interesting question is are rivers a<br>good proxy to snow precipitation that we<br>don't have very many insitu samples to<br>help validate our models or are they not<br>because of all the um all the fluxes<br>that happen after after<br>deposition I that's an outstanding<br>question in New Zealand because it's so<br>you know it's so windy and you get so<br>much melt freezing that happens like I<br>suspect that there could be a fair<br>amount of variation after deposition but<br>um that's kind of the we collected all<br>these snow samples and then we kind of<br>had to ask ourselves like you know of<br>what relevance is this for from a<br>hydrologic perspective it's like I think<br>we can use those snow samples as good<br>values for understanding the<br>precipitation values at the time of<br>deposition but you know that once it<br>actually gets into the environment it<br>might look different<br>yeah well let's let's do it let's make<br>that comparison I can I can make a<br>prediction right from our model and send<br>it to you and you can tell me how wrong<br>I<br>am if everything works um then I think<br>we have a really solid<br>story I really I really think that<br>process of sending each other<br>information and and telling each other<br>how wrong we are is is how we need how<br>we will make these things better yes you<br>know in relating the the precipitation<br>predictions to the rivers and the river<br>values to the um uh to the the<br>precipitate and then just you know inch<br>our way<br>forward yes I<br>agree sounds like another paper or<br>something it sounds like a couple of<br>papers yeah yeah and also you know<br>thinking about how to best design this<br>moving forward um and anybody who's done<br>peer-reviewed work before knows that you<br>know the the peer rreview process can<br>often be painful but you always learn<br>something important from it and you know<br>I think this is an example of how we can<br>recognize the limitations of what we did<br>before and improve it on the on the next<br>step and that's why I'm happy to have<br>you know you Bruce and you Alice<br>involved in at least talking about this<br>you know so we can figure out best ways<br>to move forward and it would be awesome<br>if we could all get together sometime<br>maybe at a meeting or somewhere to Hash<br>this out in more detail are you still<br>coming down for another winter sampling<br>uh it should be two weeks from now yeah<br>uh well then I mean I I'm here okay I'll<br>get in touch okay once we have a<br>schedule so awesome I think we should<br>probably wrap up here yeah okay I might<br>have to figure out where I need to where<br>I need to kind of trim trim down the<br>yeah the conversation<br>um<br>but I would like to thank you on behalf<br>of the Environmental Research<br>Institute</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
