panel<br>that we have so my name is Sarah I'm I'm<br>in the international marketing and<br>recruitment team from the University and<br>to my left I start with Gary good up<br>everyone hi my name is Gary and I'm the<br>director of the pathway program and I'm<br>looking forward to telling you a lot<br>more about that uh in the next hour<br>fantastic and and C everybody my name is<br>an Spears I'm the team leader of student<br>support at pathway and English Language<br>Center and sitting to my right Kiora<br>Paul Baker I'm the director of the<br>English Language Center and most<br>importantly our most important person on<br>the panel here today Lyn um um I'm a<br>former study students at University of<br>otago I'm currently doing Bachelor of<br>Commerce degree in University fantastic<br>thanks Len so welcome up we're here for<br>an hour today so hopefully we will be<br>able to answer all the questions for you<br>so as I said very warm greetings to the<br>University of atago we are New Zealand's<br>first University formed in 1869 and we<br>have our own pathway and English<br>Foundation program so anything today and<br>got any questions questions please pop<br>them in the Q&amp;A box and we will<br>hopefully have time at the end to answer<br>these for you so it is a packed agenda<br>so we're going to start off with a<br>little introduction to New Zealand and<br>den if you're not familiar with us why<br>the university then we're going to get<br>into Pathways and English language and<br>finishing up with M student story of<br>linen here about her experience studying<br>in denan so going on sexual one New<br>Zealand and den so ATO in New Zealand it<br>is an absolute beautiful country if you<br>haven't heard we are small but we are<br>Mighty we have a population of five<br>million and we have three official<br>languages so English which hopefully<br>some of you will be coming here to study<br>Tero Mai our local indigenous language<br>and New Zealand sign language I am<br>clasping my hands because I am very with<br>it it's not say language I'm not that<br>skilled and but said that is third<br>official language so New Zealand oroa is<br>an incredibly safe country and we're<br>gender equal we are also the 11th<br>happiest so great destination to<br>consider for your studies and we very<br>much um take the approach of um Mari<br>principles of makaki Tanga which is<br>welcoming Hospitality kindness<br>generosity and support of what you learn<br>that today so why should you consider<br>studying in New Zealand we have eight<br>New Zealand universities and we're all<br>ranked within the top 3% of universities<br>in the world we really have a worldclass<br>education it's all about critical<br>thinking Hands-On learning working<br>collaboratively problem solving<br>creativity these are the skills that you<br>will learn while you study here we we<br>may be at the bottom of the Pacific but<br>we have massive research collaborations<br>across the world and international<br>collaborations with many different<br>universities and from a student persp<br>perspective um we were also the first<br>country to adopt a strict code of<br>practice and care for international<br>students and again that's reflected in<br>manaki Tang that I talked about earlier<br>on so two islands um north and south and<br>we're located in the south island in the<br>lower part in the beautiful Harbor and<br>Oceanside City of denan how would you<br>get to us well we've got two main<br>International gateways ockland and<br>Christ Church a lot of you will be<br>dialing in from Asia um or maybe a bit<br>further a field they'd be your two key<br>gateways but also you can transfer<br>through Australia into Queenstown or<br>Wellington then it's just a short<br>domestic flight down from Christ Church<br>or Oakland or a drive from Queen<br>toown so why would you think about Denon<br>as a study center we are a fantastic<br>student City we're small we're only<br>130,000 strong but out of those 25,000<br>students so you can see how vibrant that<br>we would be here and we love it um you<br>may tell from my accent I'm not<br>originally from New Zealand I migrated<br>here 25 years ago it's a fantastic<br>country to live in our city has got the<br>brightest we've got the highest<br>concentration of postgraduate<br>qualifications and we have a fantastic<br>lifestyle here we very much are a 20<br>minute City you can get around in<br>everything from nature culture sport<br>fashion and obviously food so in<br>comparison to a lot of countries you'll<br>be dialing in for we have four distinct<br>Seasons here so we have a spring a<br>summer a winter and an autumn in those<br>orders currently we're in Winter um and<br>a lot of the questions I get asked when<br>I'm sure is how cold is it well it's<br>definitely not North America cold but we<br>do have our cooler days but then the<br>snow we maybe get it two or three times<br>a year disappears by lunchtime because<br>we're a coastal city but always a great<br>experience so denan we're small we're<br>compact this gives you a bit of an<br>overview of our city to the right hand<br>side of the screen is where we have our<br>University campus including our pathway<br>language school and right across to St<br>Clair the beautiful<br>Oceanside got lots of retail and cafes<br>bars that you can explore while you're<br>here as well but we also have the most<br>beautiful wonderful Wildlife um nature<br>Adventure on our doorstep as well this<br>is a bit of a snapshot of some of this<br>iconic scenery we have if you feel like<br>climbing a mountain this is a place to<br>come everything from skiing to kaying to<br>Mountain hiking all within a three to<br>four hour drive so lots that you can do<br>to get out and<br>explore so we've talked a little bit<br>about the destination a little bit about<br>what surrounds us and now I'm going to<br>go into white attack go so as I said we<br>are New Zealand's first University so it<br>gives a very longstanding history here<br>we are ranked in the top 1% of<br>universities in the world so you know<br>you're going to get a great academic<br>standard while you are here but for me<br>most importantly I think is the fact<br>that your award-winning lecturers for<br>seven out of the last 11 years we have<br>won New Zealand's top tertiary teaching<br>award you really are a person here you<br>will know your academic staff by name<br>we're very personable and it's a great<br>cohesive<br>University so out of our um university<br>itself we've got about 21,000 students<br>across three campuses our main campus is<br>denan and this is where you would come<br>for pathway um that we have about 18,000<br>students on our campus around 2 and a<br>half thousand International from over 90<br>countries so we welcome from far and<br>wide here um and you can tell from the<br>number of underground and postgraduate<br>subjects that we have and we're very<br>proud probably one of our favorite ones<br>is that we are beautiful um and we're a<br>very walkable city as well so again<br>you're surrounded by Beauty and an<br>inspiring place to study we're ranked<br>two on four in the world but a huge sve<br>of subjects across a very wide range of<br>our academic<br>divisions okay so I've done a lot of<br>talking so now it's time for me to pass<br>over to Gary who will now continue on<br>about the pathway in English Language<br>Center thanks Sarah um yes I want to<br>tell you a little bit about the pathway<br>Department before we ask Paul to talk<br>about the English Language Center so<br>we're we're like cousins or or brothers<br>but um pathway is actually a department<br>it's a department in the university and<br>it's a department in the academic<br>division of the<br>university and we've got two main um<br>programs that we teach one is a<br>foundation study certificate and the<br>other one is diplomas undergraduate<br>diplomas for the first year of study so<br>I want to just tell you a little bit<br>about both of those but what is common<br>to both of them is that we teach these<br>programs in a really supportive<br>environment and by that we mean as Sarah<br>has just said we get to know you you're<br>in small classes a maximum of 18<br>students in the tutorial classes lots of<br>activities so you get to know each other<br>and really it becomes a very personal<br>education so that we we know that you're<br>doing well and we try to support you<br>right through it and I'm also going to<br>ask Ang later to talk about the amazing<br>student support that we've got as well<br>you don't have to uh do anything on your<br>own there's always someone to support<br>whatever you want to do just touching on<br>that um just International students or<br>do we have New Zealand and international<br>no we're we're um both so uh it's for<br>both International and domestic students<br>last year and this year for that matter<br>we've got students from 30 one different<br>countries in our two to 300 students at<br>the moment so yeah amazing culture<br>fantastic um so there there are several<br>um Pathways from wherever you start in<br>the University so you can start right at<br>the beginning after school and you can<br>do our foundation study certificate so<br>that's one way into into um<br>undergraduate<br>study if you've already had a little bit<br>of experience and you've done really<br>well in your last year of high school<br>preps and but you haven't quite got<br>University entrance then you could uh<br>enroll in our diplomas so that's two<br>common ways to get in uh for many of you<br>of course you'll uh come come straight<br>into undergraduate study first year<br>undergraduate study uh as you leave high<br>school if you've been away for a while<br>if you've been out working since you've<br>been at school uh then great Foundation<br>studies would be an ideal place to start<br>because you can refresh and get ready<br>for the for the rigers of undergraduate<br>study yeah and if you don't meet um<br>English language requirements Y and so<br>Paul's an expert on that I'll let him<br>chime in here yeah so um if you've done<br>Arts before or you you haven't quite met<br>the criteria for any of these programs<br>you can come to The Language Center join<br>our programs and get to the right level<br>before passing back to Gary and his team<br>and pathway it means you don't need to<br>worry about doing the Arts exam again<br>you just need to focus on improving your<br>English gaining confidence and then<br>you're ready for further study fantastic<br>so I think the messages no matter what<br>educational background You' have got we<br>can almost certainly find a pathway into<br>study for you excellent okay let me just<br>dwell a bit on the foundation study<br>certificate so it's that it's uh it's at<br>a level just above high school um if you<br>pass when you pass the foundation study<br>certificate it's a university entrance<br>certificate for all universities in New<br>Zealand we'd like you to stay at at Taro<br>but you could go to other universities<br>if you want to as well so it's um it's<br>an eight-month program it's two 13we<br>semesters you do five papers in each<br>semester and you have to pass eight out<br>of the 10 papers in order to be awarded<br>the certificate we do have an academic<br>English uh paper in both semesters and<br>it's really the English skills you need<br>for University success so you do have to<br>pass both of those papers so what that<br>guarantees is that when you've got your<br>foundation study certificate you're<br>ready to thrive when you get into<br>undergraduate study at University we<br>have three intakes every year so um<br>depending on where you come from in the<br>world you can join in February you can<br>join in June or you can join in October<br>which is what Lyn did um a couple of<br>years ago and we mentioned before it's<br>for both domestic and international<br>students and that's why we have the<br>three intakes to make sure that we can<br>cater for just about anyone um in terms<br>of what study you want to undertake at<br>the University we have papers that serve<br>us all four academic divisions I'm going<br>to tell you about in a minute so whether<br>you want to do Health Sciences business<br>Commerce Arts Humanities or any of the<br>Sciences we can prepare you for that in<br>the foundation study certificate program<br>now you may have heard a word there that<br>you're not quite sure what it means do<br>you want to explain what papers means<br>okay yes so papers programs um papers<br>for us is one course of study so for<br>instance if you're going to do Health<br>Science you might do physics and<br>chemistry and biology we call them<br>papers a biology paper a chemistry paper<br>a physics paper y good good to clarify<br>that um so what are the benefits of the<br>foundation studies program well we<br>really want you to thrive at University<br>so we want you to be confident Learners<br>by the time you leave us and you will be<br>so the teachers are experts in uh<br>pathway type study transitional study<br>and so they'll help you to to achieve<br>your<br>goals um what else can I tell you oh yes<br>um in terms of coming in um Paul's<br>mentioned the English language<br>requirements so for undergraduate study<br>um you would if you're an international<br>student you would need an i score of 6.0<br>or better or equivalent to UHS<br>equivalent so to come into the<br>foundation study certificate it's just<br>5.5 no B below five<br>awesome okay then the pathways that<br>you've G yeah so these are the four<br>divisions that I was talking about so<br>the University of atago we've got a huge<br>number of courses you can take so but<br>the four academic divisions are the<br>business Division and you can see the<br>degrees there bcom entrepreneurship Etc<br>you can do three-year degree you can do<br>three and a half year degree you can do<br>a four-year degree with two majors like<br>a Bachelor of Arts and Commerce and<br>they're the majors that you can see down<br>below likewise for the Humanities it's<br>an incredibly flexible degree most of<br>the undergraduate degree these are three<br>years but again you could do a double<br>major in a in a four-year uh<br>program uh and with the Sciences too The<br>Bachelor of Science Arts and Science<br>Commerce and science if you've been<br>looking at this two years ago you might<br>have seen a bachelor of applied science<br>we've Incorporated that now into our<br>Bachelor of Science degrees and look at<br>the huge number wouldn't mind going back<br>huge number of science um Majors there<br>but you you'll also see things like<br>surveying um statistics sport<br>development management there so a lot of<br>things that you you might not have<br>thought about but massive number of<br>courses you can<br>take and uh we are really quite famous<br>for all our undergraduate degrees<br>actually but Health Sciences we're the<br>only uh Dental training University in<br>New Zealand so if you want to become a<br>doctor a dentist if you want to get<br>involved in um Pharmacy or physiotherapy<br>or midlab science then um we have<br>degrees<br>for for you and including a whole lot of<br>um of Health degrees as<br>well okay I want to go back now to the<br>pathway Department I mentioned that<br>there are there are two programs there<br>the foundation study certificate and<br>diplomas these diplomas are new this<br>year these are diplomas for the first<br>year of study so if you're doing the<br>diploma it's your first year of<br>undergraduate study and when you finish<br>the diploma you go directly into the<br>second year so um it's for students for<br>people that may not have had the the<br>qualification to get directly into<br>undergraduate study we can still find a<br>place for you so it's a it's a first<br>year of study um it's the equivalent of<br>78 Point papers which is what all our<br>undergraduate degrees have so it's 126<br>credits so again it's five papers per<br>semester um but some of those papers are<br>only sixo papers so don't don't stress<br>that you see 10 papers there and not<br>seven it's the equivalent of seven<br>papers and I'll explain that in a minute<br>again for domestics and Internationals<br>and you can do a diploma in arts a<br>diploma in Commerce and a diploma in<br>science if you you can't do one in<br>Health Sciences that's something else<br>I'll talk about later so what are the<br>benefits well um even if you haven't got<br>uh uh University entrance you may be<br>able to start your undergraduate study<br>anyway and still do your degree in three<br>years um you can get a p way student<br>visa to go right through so the the<br>academic requirements we've got<br>different requirements for each country<br>but they basically you need to have<br>studied in your last year of high<br>school and you need an ey outs of 5.5<br>5.5 not 6.0 so that's another benefit of<br>it as well because we'll be closely<br>supporting you again with a lot of those<br>academic English skills that you<br>need so I I'll explain these briefly so<br>this is why we call it a well supported<br>program and again you'll see 10 papers<br>there but don't worry the ones in dark<br>blue there are only 9 point or 6 point<br>papers as opposed to 18 point papers so<br>the reason we um can bring you into the<br>university into the diploma even if you<br>haven't got University entrance as long<br>as you're quite close is that we're<br>going to teach you the skills you need<br>to be successful we're going to teach<br>you the academic skills you need for<br>English and for University success so<br>those dark blue um papers there that<br>we've got down there the pathway 1011 10<br>2 103 104 they're skill-based papers in<br>small classes then we've got some the<br>dark blue the other blue um lighter blue<br>I should say papers there we teach all<br>of those in um small groups so they're<br>similar to existing papers at the<br>University but we teach them within our<br>department and the papers in gold at the<br>bottom they're the regular scheduled<br>undergraduate first year papers from<br>around the university so students that<br>do this diploma will have a combination<br>of some classes together small groups<br>and some papers around the university<br>with all the other students so the<br>structure is the same in the diploma in<br>arts I think is coming next so really<br>similar slight changes it's a really<br>flexible degree I mentioned that so<br>slight changes but those skills based<br>papers are the same and again those<br>three papers around the university and<br>The Bachelor of Science sorry the<br>diploma in science similar structure<br>again um and again you do three 100<br>level papers one point I should note<br>with the diploma in science and it's on<br>the next slide is that uh you can do any<br>major you want but to do it in three<br>years our diploma would service those 20<br>Majors so if you want a major that's not<br>on that list there it might take you<br>three and a half years but you can still<br>do it after you do the<br>diploma okay so that is the University<br>Pathways we do have some other Pathways<br>available to International students so<br>if you're in a country country that is<br>serviced by<br>ncuk then they do an International<br>Foundation year leading into a degree at<br>a Tagle and and we also have certain<br>articulation programs so if you are in a<br>the country you're in and there's a<br>university that or a college that you<br>want to look at pathway and you want to<br>stay at home for that year then please<br>contact our International marketing team<br>and they can point you in the right<br>direction so now it's Paul's turn and we<br>are on to General English right So for<br>anybody who's interested in improving<br>their English we have got a program for<br>you so a lot of our students will come<br>to study right in the heart of the<br>campus get all of the benefits of The<br>Wider University including clubs and<br>societies libraries all of the different<br>places you can eat uh while just being<br>here for English for maybe as short a<br>period as just four weeks so we've got<br>five levels in our general English<br>programs from elementary at the lowest<br>level through to Advanced so whatever<br>your current level of English we've got<br>a class that will suit you we'll be<br>asking you to do an online placement<br>test before you arrive so we know well<br>in advance which class will be best for<br>your<br>study now um a full-time student<br>studying English language with us<br>will'll get 23 hours of tuition a week<br>that will be made up at intermediate<br>level and higher with about 15 hours of<br>General English plus a variety of<br>options so if you're interested in doing<br>the Arts examin<br>you could choose to do an Arts<br>preparation option you might be<br>interested in learning more about New<br>Zealand so you could take New Zealand<br>studies or you might be looking for<br>something that's more useful for your<br>future career and using English in the<br>workplace so you could do English for<br>practical<br>purposes now I talked before about<br>providing a pathway into Gary's programs<br>the pathway and the foundation study<br>certificate and diploma if you haven't<br>met the English language requirements to<br>get directly into those programs and<br>don't really want to do an Ops<br>examination or a tol examination again<br>you can make that pathway simply by<br>working hard in our general English<br>program meeting our internal assessments<br>and then starting with Gary when you're<br>ready we also have flexible start dates<br>so we encourage people to start at the<br>beginning of our terms and an will talk<br>about that shortly but about every four<br>weeks we'll have an opportunity for<br>well our English for Taro is what we<br>call our Flagship program and this<br>program is designed for students that<br>have already met the academic entry<br>requirements of the Taro so you've got a<br>conditional offer for studying with us<br>but you haven't yet made the English<br>language requirements if you haven't<br>done that English raro is probably the<br>best pathway for you it's a 12-week<br>program that runs before each semester<br>at ataro and it provides a pathway for<br>both postgraduate and undergraduate<br>study so if you for example you've got a<br>5.5 or equivalent INR want to do<br>undergraduate study you'll automatically<br>be accepted onto English R tago and the<br>same applies if you're planning to do<br>postgraduate study a 6.0 alss will meet<br>the requirements for our postgrad<br>English Taro and that meets the<br>requirements for most postgraduate study<br>at a taret we also accept other<br>International entrance exams for efo<br>including the Pearson test of English<br>language SE total<br>IBT excellent okay so we're going to<br>move now on to application processes and<br>dates and over to<br>you well as you can see there we have um<br>many options doesn't matter where you<br>are in the world you can look forward to<br>being able to enter into either the<br>Foundation program or um the English<br>language um programs uh at a time that<br>suits you and as you can see there we<br>have three intakes for the foundation<br>cours which is in February June and<br>October<br>we have entrance for our diploma course<br>which starts at this stage um in<br>February um and we have varying dates to<br>enter into the English language courses<br>and what you can see on the screen there<br>is our main intakes however if you<br>wanted to start at another time you<br>could inquire with our admissions team<br>and they would give you the most<br>convenient time uh starting round about<br>when you would be wanting to come over<br>here so there are more options to start<br>in the English language courses you just<br>need to um inquire with our admissions<br>team and you can apply for the uh<br>diploma um on uh through the evision<br>portal through the ataga university web<br>page but for the foundation study<br>certificate and uh English language<br>courses you need to apply online via the<br>uh pathway uh uh website or the English<br>Language Center website and you can see<br>the link up there on the screen awesome<br>thank you okay touching on scholarships<br>I know a hot question when we're<br>offshore students want to know um are<br>they eligible for scholarship so<br>delighted to see that we have<br>scholarships for our pathway students um<br>and you must submit an application for<br>that at 5,000 New Zealand Dollars toward<br>your tuition<br>fees um students going into the<br>international bachelor degree so then<br>it's a further 10,000 New Zealand<br>tuition fee scholarship off their first<br>year and moving on to our Global<br>scholarships these are for um certain<br>countries aable to countries that you<br>will see on your screens and again these<br>are for the bachelor program so pathway<br>first of all and then<br>Bachelor and for anybody who is dialing<br>in from New Zealand who's an<br>international student we also have our<br>um undergraduate entrance scholarships<br>screen there too so lots for everybody<br>and anybody who is um has is off sure at<br>the moment we do have manaki government<br>scholarships these are New Zealand's<br>based scholarships and they will cover<br>full scholarships as a variety of<br>countries eligible for those they will<br>come out in January um early so January<br>2025 for those so keep an eye on<br>those when it comes to tuition fees this<br>is a approximate cost for you um based<br>on New Zealand dollars they will vary<br>for 2025 coming up so um just just gives<br>you an idea and indication of what costs<br>are available there okay so we're going<br>to break it up with some frequently<br>asked questions that we get all the time<br>so we'll be sharing this with our panel<br>now<br>so a question how could you decide<br>whether you'd want to do Foundation<br>study certificate or diploma good<br>question well um let's uh start with the<br>New Zealand version of this and then<br>translate it into International versions<br>if you're in New Zealand then and you've<br>completed your second last year of high<br>school then you could do the foundation<br>study certificate to do the diploma<br>you'd have to have done your what we<br>call year 13 probably your year 12<br>you've got to do your last year of high<br>school so that's the first thing it<br>depends on your background it would also<br>depend on your academic achievement if<br>you're really near Miss if you're really<br>close to undergraduate entry probably<br>the diploma is the thing for you we want<br>you to succeed as quick quickly as you<br>can but if you're a bit further away you<br>need a year to refresh maybe you want to<br>do Health Sciences but you didn't take<br>physics or Cam probably the foundation<br>study certificate is the one for you so<br>there's not a single one answer to that<br>we we'd look at you we we'd help you<br>with whatever your profile of academic<br>achievement is and we'd find the best<br>pathway for you we don't want to hold<br>you back in fact the opposite we want to<br>push you on as quickly as we can but<br>make sure you're prepared great answer<br>okay and could you to the diploma after<br>you finish your foundation the answer is<br>yes you can of course and uh even if you<br>haven't quite passed the foundation<br>study certificate as long as you pass<br>seven papers you can do the<br>diploma uh yeah the diploma yeah and and<br>how could I apply for a pathway<br>scholarship if I've already received my<br>Foundation um admission offer oh yeah<br>it's on the website um so if you have a<br>look at our website we'll flash that up<br>some stage um it's sitting right there<br>so if you're International student then<br>um you really and and I've got a good<br>question here what's the most important<br>criteria for pathway scholarship so if<br>you're an international the most<br>important criteria is around your<br>academic achievement so you need to<br>detail your academic achievement<br>honestly speaking if you've got a school<br>principal or someone that knows you well<br>and writes a letter of reference for you<br>even if it's your parents or your best<br>friend but if someone writes a a letter<br>of reference for you that that you know<br>that would help as well just help us to<br>get a picture of you we want to give the<br>scholarships away we're not trying to<br>hold them<br>back okay and the difference between the<br>foundation study certificate hell<br>science stream hell science first year<br>and The Bachelor of Hell Sciences am I<br>answering that you could well I can<br>answer that if you want or do you want<br>to answer it I'm I'm may you to go<br>they're all completely different okay<br>just talked about the foundation study<br>certificate that's the a one year<br>eight-month program of two semesters<br>that prepares you for those four<br>academic divisions I wor I I talked<br>about so that's the foundation study<br>certificate the Health Sciences stream<br>is one of those four streams in the<br>foundation study certificate Okay so<br>we've got a Health Sciences stream got<br>Commerce we got arts and we've got<br>Sciences so there are four streams that<br>make up the foundation study certificate<br>health science is one of them Health<br>Science first year is completely<br>different so that's the first year of<br>undergraduate study for students that<br>want to do a medical degree or a<br>bmedical science degree so that's not<br>Foundation it's not the diploma it's<br>first year of undergraduate study it's a<br>good strong year of study to prepare you<br>for being a doctor a dentist<br>physiotherapist Etc and a bachelor of<br>Health Science is one of those degrees<br>that we talked about in the um health<br>science or science faculty so so um um<br>it's a full uh three or fouryear degree<br>perfectly answered okay moving on to<br>English night if I successfully complete<br>my English for a Tagle course do I need<br>to reset eye out very easy answer no oh<br>look at that straightforward I I think<br>the big advantage of English reti that<br>as well as meeting the English language<br>requirements it's really really good<br>preparation for study at a New Zealand<br>University it's teaching you the study<br>schills you'll need how to write an<br>academic essay how to reference it's<br>really excellent preparation for study<br>fantastic Okay so we've done the<br>frequently asked questions on to the<br>next important part that we all get<br>asked accommodation and living cost so<br>the University of aago which I referen<br>is a residential University 86% of our<br>students travel from all over New<br>Zealand Australia and the rest of the<br>world to come here so our first year<br>students as well as our foundation or<br>diploma students could stay at one of<br>our 15 residential colleges these<br>colleges are fantastic support for<br>students academically activities Etc you<br>have your own bedroom um all your meals<br>are catered For it really is more than<br>just a hostel or a college it's a home<br>away from home it's where you meet your<br>friends um great place to start um your<br>New Zealand um study life so and we also<br>have options available at these colleges<br>for under 18s as well so again you can<br>ask us um any specific questions on that<br>but that gives you the indication of<br>what to apply for the majority of our<br>residential colleges well all of them<br>are in within walking distance some are<br>closer than others they all have<br>different looks and feels so again you<br>can look at that on our website and then<br>we're going to talk about homestate and<br>you're a homeate<br>expert well if you if a residential<br>college is not for you and you are not<br>ready to go flatting on your own then we<br>also have an option that has run out of<br>our pathway office for Homestay this is<br>where you would get to stay with a kiwi<br>family and um they would take care of<br>you prepare your meals provide you with<br>your own room um nice and warm and um<br>the family would look after you and tell<br>you how you can get to uh your classes<br>show you where the bus stops are<br>orientate you to the city it is a very<br>very gentle way to orientate yourself to<br>study in New Zealand so that is another<br>option we have a dedicated home stay<br>office um at pathway and Language Center<br>so this is a really great way especially<br>if you are younger and you are unsure of<br>New Zealand culture and you want someone<br>to show you the way this is a great<br>option for you coming to New Zealand to<br>um orientate yourself to life here in<br>New Zealand um and then you can look at<br>other options after that Lynn I heard<br>that you did Homestay do you want to<br>give a little bit about your experience<br>was a four month period um it was a<br>small Homestay though it's only me and<br>my host and and a cat but she took<br>really good care of me awesome yeah we<br>like Cooks together together fak<br>together and she took me out to um<br>dinner during my birthday a and then um<br>I got a Christmas present from her my<br>mom's really loves<br>her and that's what hom stad does it<br>really is that makaki taga that we<br>talked about earlier on um another<br>option for accommodation and this is for<br>our postgraduate students predominantly<br>who' be doing English for a Tagle is our<br>University Flats we have 250 of these<br>this is where you would share um a house<br>normally in New Zealand we call them<br>flats and shared kitchen Lounge um<br>normally has an outdoor area great way<br>to get to know people fantastic<br>supportive Community around it and so<br>very much again a great immersion into<br>life in New<br>Zealand cost of living this will give<br>you an approximate in New Zealand<br>dollars and of what you're looking at<br>for Residential College hom State UNIF<br>flats and an idea of um other costs as<br>well semester to give you something to<br>to budget<br>towards life on campus and student<br>support we are so proud of this at a<br>Tagle we have a fantastic um facilities<br>activities and everything and a brand<br>new pathway an English language home yes<br>we've um the University have supported<br>us to move to a new facility we were in<br>a really good facility before this but<br>we're in a better place now so it's<br>actually in the aaga business school<br>even though we offer all those other um<br>uh courses um but yeah amazing amazing<br>um second and third floor so this is it<br>you come into this brand new carpet<br>brand new uh<br>finishings nice and warm all cool when<br>it's it's too hot outside but um a lot<br>of colors there reflecting the colors<br>around our<br>Peninsula and just amazing so we've only<br>been in the for less than two months and<br>we're loving it students are loving it<br>teachers are loving it amazing brand new<br>brand spanking new<br>fantastic and then this goes on to some<br>a snapshot of our wider campus as we<br>said we've got an incredibly diverse<br>range of programs everything from School<br>of Performing Arts to the dental school<br>and a great campus to walk around so the<br>question is how do I make friends as<br>usually and how do I get into New<br>Zealand life a huge range of clubs and<br>societies we have a phenomenal three<br>level fitness facility so there's<br>something there for everybody and we<br>really are inclusive everything from<br>multifaith support through to um<br>accessible disability and not only our<br>our students International but also our<br>academic staff you will get taught by a<br>huge range of nationalities here and it<br>really does prepare you for the global<br>world so on that subject of support um<br>Andre's here and we are I'm conscious of<br>time so let's talk on the support that<br>we've got so we have a dedicated support<br>team at pathway and English Language<br>Center and the support team is there to<br>uh look after your well-being give you<br>some study skills um advice um basically<br>listen to any issue that you've got that<br>is not related to your academic study<br>but it also could be related to your<br>academic study but our doors are always<br>open we are um well trained and and<br>nothing is a surprise to us so if you<br>are having culture shock if you are<br>having any issues at home relationship<br>problems if you are feeling a bit low or<br>you're unwell a whole range of issues<br>could be going on in your life um that<br>you might struggle to tell other people<br>about you need to come and talk to us we<br>can help you I can guarantee that if you<br>come into our office and have a talk you<br>will leave the office feeling a little<br>bit better so it's always good to come<br>in early talk to a student advisor and<br>um we will help you with any issue that<br>you've got we can also link you to other<br>services such as student health they<br>have uh doctors nurses they also have<br>counselors there so um in the New<br>Zealand culture it is very important<br>that people receive the help early we<br>don't want you being at home dealing<br>with things by yourself it is very<br>normal to have your ups and downs so<br>please do come in and talk to student<br>support um we are definitely here to<br>help so you can see there on the screen<br>all the things we help with yeah and<br>also there's a wider range of support<br>servic as well when you get to<br>University here so again it's all we<br>have to do is ask this touches on some<br>of it for everything from student and<br>academic support dedicated to<br>international student Support Services<br>Insurance learning you name it it's here<br>probably one of the favorite parts for a<br>lot of our students on campus is are<br>seven fantastic University libraries and<br>as a pathway or English language student<br>you have access to all of these it is<br>not separate like Gary and Paul have<br>mentioned you are immersed already in<br>the University so they are there student<br>health which an just touched on again<br>right on campus dedicated to our<br>students and our friendly team at campus<br>watch I love the photo of the duckling<br>on this because our ducklings go Rogue<br>Every Spring and they help there as well<br>this is to help um make sure everybody's<br>safe we have a large number of students<br>on um younger students on campus and<br>they just keep a friendly eye very good<br>at changing light bulbs and University<br>Flats losing keys so they're there to to<br>help and guide you on the way to so<br>getting involved at a Tagle what does<br>that<br>mean well part of your wellbeing means<br>getting involved getting out there you<br>may want to continue a hobby that you<br>had that you were doing at home or you<br>may want to try something new so our<br>student support team also has an<br>activities program and we will have a<br>calendar available and you'll see that<br>when you get here um but one of the<br>things that we do do um is run a trip to<br>Queenstown or there may be a trip out in<br>the atago pinula to see the amazing<br>Wildlife that we have on our doorstep um<br>penguins and seals and uh all sorts of<br>birds um and also other activities that<br>might be cheaper or free uh trips to the<br>museum for example um it could even be a<br>cupcake decorating competition it is<br>very important that you get involved<br>this is how you can make friends and<br>take care of your well-being so we've<br>got a few things coming up this year we<br>have a speech competition coming up in<br>July um and we've got a trip to tiapo<br>where there are some hot Poes and some<br>snow Sports as well well and every year<br>we have a fantastic Christmas party<br>where we have a very secret person who<br>comes along and gives out presents and<br>chocolates and that would be Santa<br>Claus I wanted to do the te AO and the<br>newsly trip I need to be a pathway<br>student okay so it's about getting<br>involved with the pathway ones but you<br>also have access as I said to all the<br>university resources as well there are<br>so many different things that you can<br>come involved in everything from making<br>a difference through sustainability<br>initiatives through to leadership awards<br>and getting into your global citizenship<br>so there really is something there for<br>everybody you've heard from us and you<br>can also use our amazing um app called<br>UD and that will connect you I promise<br>you with a real life person they are not<br>chat Bots these are students on the<br>ground at the University learn what it's<br>like to study here and they'll happily<br>answer your questions so yeah they're<br>great resource to connect with and I am<br>delighted to say it's now time for our<br>student story so this is Lynn where you<br>make your um now let just have we look<br>at the camera there that would be<br>fantastic and tell the audience about<br>yourself um yeah I'm an international<br>students at University of oo from Hanoi<br>um Vietnam the very populated um City<br>I've been um my first times to otago was<br>October 2022 in my October intake um my<br>hobby is just painting and baking and<br>cooking and um I only join us only have<br>an opportunity to join one club like for<br>now the um Vietnamese um Students<br>Association here so yeah hopefully so<br>how did you find the difference between<br>Hanoi and<br>denan uh it's very different I would say<br>because Hanoi it's just like hot every<br>year is a very populated city while Den<br>is like more um SCH I would say yeah yes<br>like more<br>tranquil and why did you choose a tle um<br>I've heard about otago credentials from<br>one of the international stuff Town yeah<br>um I was actually considering between<br>University of Oakland and otago and then<br>um Tam who is like he used to study here<br>he also did Bachelor Commerce she's like<br>um no Taco is also good it also has like<br>credential for Commerce and um like<br>degrees about Finance so yeah I chose<br>otago oh it's also because my uncles's<br>um lives here so it's also like better<br>to have um like a person you know while<br>you in a alone in like a different<br>country and yeah and how have you find<br>so obviously much quieter than Hanoi but<br>the support you got from F pathway how<br>did you find that um it was really<br>helpful um I suggest students like make<br>use of it because class in passway it's<br>like a just like a tutorials in<br>University so it's like much smaller so<br>I feel like um the teachers take better<br>care for you yeah nice and did you I<br>hear you may met your best friend yeah<br>jna so met your best friend at<br>Foundation yeah yeah and now yeah now<br>I'm my flatmates fantastic and you both<br>continue to study on at the University<br>yeah great great that's a great story<br>because when you started the October<br>intake there only around about a dozen<br>students with was the smallest intake<br>but you've got you became you all became<br>quite good friends didn't you yeah yeah<br>it was great was fantastic yeah<br>fantastic so what does a day in your<br>life look like um I just I I went to I<br>went to library to study and then went<br>home do groceries and then um do<br>cookings with my friend I say it's also<br>different um when I was in my home H<br>stay um yeah my four month period of hom<br>stay um because my Homestay is quite far<br>from school so I don't really um get a<br>chance to like stay at school late yeah<br>and um it was only me and my host so<br>although it's like fun but sometimes<br>it's better when you have like friends<br>with you yeah yeah yeah so now you're in<br>a flat and you're part of the Vietnamese<br>Association yeah and how are you finding<br>that um it was good<br>because my club don't really um we<br>currently struggling on fighting members<br>yeah but I somehow manage to save it oh<br>good on you look at that<br>resourceful love it so some top tips for<br>students who are thinking about coming<br>here and what it would be like a pathway<br>uh pathway probably just makes use of um<br>University resource and like don't be<br>afraid to ask for help because um you<br>know it's like a small classroom and um<br>teachers like take better cares for you<br>so um so they like pay more attention to<br>you because it's only like 10 student<br>there 10 20s so yeah and also um just<br>about time management I guess so like<br>prioritize what important and um study<br>for your exams like a week um ahead of<br>it and then<br>um yeah it's just about self disciplines<br>oh and also active participation yeah if<br>you have any question just um just ask<br>and like don't miss any lectures or<br>tutorials you also can join groups and<br>communities and um make friends through<br>tutorials which I didn't have the chance<br>um because my intake was in October so<br>they're barely any students there yeah<br>like old clubs and um clubs and like um<br>students are not really there because<br>people are in their holidays yeah so<br>yeah so taking care so so now you've got<br>your best friend though that you met<br>there life is good right excellent and<br>how did you find the transition from<br>Foundation through to doing your beom um<br>I actually don't have any problems with<br>it but um the difference probably<br>because passway is only like a very<br>small classroom while in University a<br>lecture can be like up to 200 100<br>students so you can like you go to a<br>campus and like you go to a lectures and<br>you can actually feel like oh so this is<br>University and some student can be like<br>overwhelming with it yeah um so it's<br>probably if you like needs help just go<br>to like student support or just your<br>friends yeah friends is probably like<br>the best like uh you make e of<br>them great advice absolutely fantastic<br>so I think that's a big part of what<br>we're talking about it's getting<br>involved it's asking questions and<br>anybody else got some top tips that<br>they'd like to give for potential<br>students coming in oh you're not going<br>to hear better than what Lind just told<br>you yeah I mean that's she's we're very<br>proud of her we'd have to say you know<br>so you came in with a small intake made<br>friends and you're all achieving really<br>well at University now it's just just<br>wonderful to see fantastic so if you<br>want to learn a little bit more and you<br>can follow us on Instagram that gives<br>you an idea of what the international<br>student um life looks like here what our<br>um students get involved in and the<br>activities on their doorstep what<br>happens in the city um and all the<br>different um things that you can do<br>so q and a session I think we have a<br>couple of um questions that our students<br>have asked us so it's time for a bit of<br>chitchat<br>everybody okay going to let you read the<br>not well I think they're mainly to do<br>with with um pathway so um the first one<br>someone's done their homework well done<br>good question this because we haven't<br>mentioned it today but I've mentioned<br>that we've got in the pathway Department<br>we've got two programs the diploma and<br>the foundation study certificate and<br>someone's asked about our third uh<br>qualification which is a bridging<br>program so it's like another step down<br>if you like in the academic ladder so if<br>we're not sure or you're not sure<br>whether you've got enough uh to succeed<br>at the found study certificate<br>undergraduate study we've got a six week<br>program called a bridging program and<br>it's just a gental introduction to the<br>subjects that you're going to be doing<br>coming up so um it's a pass or fail<br>situation so just six weeks and come and<br>do it and uh if you're pass that being<br>you're ready to go on to Foundation<br>studies and if you're not you can<br>probably repeat it again or find some<br>other way<br>in uh how many papers students have to<br>study uh six papers for that<br>um and then as there's a question here<br>um are diploma students taught in closed<br>separate classes or do they attend<br>classes together with bachelor's degree<br>students the answer is both so you might<br>remember one of th three of those slides<br>where I showed you the dark blue the<br>lighter blue and the gold so the dark<br>blue and the lighter blue that's their<br>in your words separate classes for um<br>the pathway students uh but the gold<br>ones at the bottom they all the other<br>undergraduate students in the university<br>the answer is both for that and is there<br>an age limit for our programs and this<br>is also for English Language Center<br>there's a minimum age uh level yep you<br>can't come when you're five years of age<br>you have to wait you have to wait a few<br>more years yet and um Mom and Dad might<br>have something to say about that yeah<br>it's it's 16 at the at the lower end but<br>there is no older limit if you are<br>sitting in your rocking chair at home<br>and your 95 years of age we welcome you<br>to and we have several adult students<br>every year that that are choosing you<br>know maybe they're gone working for a<br>couple of years or five years or 10<br>years and decide they they want to<br>change in life then yeah bring them<br>bring them on come on and see us we'll<br>elevators but I think we also we also<br>have a number of professional people<br>that will come simply to improve their<br>English because that will be useful for<br>them in their future careers so if<br>you're over the age of 16 and you're<br>interested in English or pathway or<br>University study a tarer is your place<br>do come it is exactly right so on the<br>screen we very much um look forward to<br>welcoming you to
