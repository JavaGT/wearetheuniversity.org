proud<br>Spectators you are also formal witnesses<br>to these official<br>proceedings a very warm welcome also to<br>Faro and Friends throughout ala and from<br>across the globe viewing these<br>proceedings via our live stream I would<br>now like to introduce to you the<br>chancellor of toting aaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington this is a role<br>that dates back to the Middle Ages when<br>the first universities were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>direction to heading aaka ladies and<br>johnen and it's my very great pleasure<br>to welcome you all to this celebration<br>it's a celebration of our graduates it's<br>a celebration of the family and friends<br>and others in your communities that have<br>supported you on this journey to the<br>degree that's going to be conferred on<br>you today it's a recognition of the work<br>that you have done the study that you<br>have put in and the success and Triumph<br>and i' use that word advisedly triumph<br>uh that we are celebrating today so I'm<br>expecting lots of clapping I'm expecting<br>cheering I'm expecting singing and<br>dancing ing because that's the sort of<br>ceremony that it is now I get it we're a<br>university and I get it that there'd be<br>people who watched us come on to the<br>stage and thought they' stumbled on some<br>strange medieval sect but the truth is<br>that the magic of a university is this<br>that we are steeped in thousands of<br>years of lived experience of great<br>traditions and of great learning and<br>that's all in the minds of these brain<br>the brain strust of the University<br>that's up behind me but the magic the<br>Alchemy is that each year a new<br>generation of students attends our<br>University bringing with them the issues<br>of the day the things that are<br>confronting and challenging them and<br>it's in the Smashing well no it doesn't<br>smash but you know in the melding the<br>gentle melding uh of those two forces<br>that the magic of a university is born<br>now I know uh that there are lots of<br>reasons why we might not celebrate<br>tonight or today it's not tonight yet is<br>it today it's just dark uh I know that I<br>know that there is War I know that there<br>is plague and pestilence I know that<br>there is want I know that there is<br>disruption I know there are lots and<br>lots of crisis in our world including<br>right here in aloa with housing with<br>cost of living with mental health uh and<br>we could go on and you and I know that<br>around the world there are sign<br>significant challenges and the people<br>are publishing books at the moment<br>called end times the people are<br>publishing books called age of<br>Revolution they are talking about<br>disruption and they are talking about<br>disillusionment they are saying that<br>those great Charters like the charter of<br>the United Nations are signed in San<br>Francisco in 1945 which said to save<br>successor Generations from the scourge<br>of War we're going to sign this<br>agreement or the great Declaration of<br>Human Rights all people are born free<br>and equal in rights and dignity they're<br>saying that those great declarations are<br>no longer relevant that the world has<br>become such a insecure Place such a<br>troubling place that we have to use<br>strong men or strong women or strong<br>leaders anyway uh dictators basically uh<br>to lead our countries because it's only<br>in that way that we can get<br>security and I want to say to you right<br>now that universities stand against that<br>assumption that universities stand<br>against that fear that the students that<br>we educate learn to think for themselves<br>they learn to use evidence and analyze<br>evidence so that they can evaluate uh<br>situations they learn to Advocate they<br>learn to debate and most and most<br>importantly they learn that they will<br>never know at all because in fact a<br>university is not a place of huge exp we<br>have huge expertise but not a place of<br>huge experti who claim to know it all<br>the foundation of a university is doubt<br>the foundation of a university is<br>questioning the foundation of a<br>university is always thinking that there<br>are things that we can learn and so that<br>is the magic that we as a university<br>bring to these troubled times that is<br>the magic that you as graduates will<br>bring to our community now I know that<br>many of you are going into business and<br>commerce and people say business and<br>commerce is all about money and business<br>and commerce has nothing to do with the<br>sorts of challenges uh that I have been<br>talking about and people that say that<br>are completely wrong they've never been<br>in a business probably or if they have<br>it's one of those 1950s one where they<br>still have hierarchical managers and<br>meaningless mission statements uh on the<br>wall uh you know that sort of stuff<br>they're always plastic and they're<br>always on the wall and values you know<br>that you can we could compose now<br>together uh so but if they had that sort<br>of view of business they haven't been<br>near a business for a while and I want<br>to say that within this community<br>business matters business matters<br>because if we're going to address the<br>challenges of want and poverty and<br>inequality we need jobs and businesses<br>create<br>jobs which give people dignity give<br>people opportunity give people funding<br>uh to enable them to live their lives<br>but more than that businesses are really<br>about taking risks the structure of a<br>business is to enable people to be able<br>to attract Capital to take risks and<br>right now we need Risk Takers we need<br>people who are prepared to try new<br>things to find new Solutions new<br>technologies and but if we walked 10<br>minutes outside this building I could<br>give you a hundred little businesses or<br>some of them quite big businesses which<br>are doing just that I wouldn't quite get<br>you to naranga Gorge but that's where<br>open star are doing Fusion technology I<br>certainly would get you to Courtney<br>place where there are so many technology<br>businesses which are genuinely<br>disrupting and changing our world for<br>the better like cogo for example a<br>little business which basically links<br>with banks gets into your accounts and<br>then tell tells you how you could be<br>better spending the your money to ensure<br>a sustainable future for our planet it's<br>unbelievable technology watch that<br>company it's going to be Stellar or<br>volara uh which has been challenging and<br>changing attitudes and and the medicine<br>uh of breast cancer using AI using new<br>technologies so business is not some<br>boring thing about money and I want to<br>salute those of you who are graduating<br>business and I want to say to you that<br>the work that you are going to do will<br>make a difference to this city to this<br>country and to our world and there be<br>some of you that are dabbling in<br>government I assume debling in<br>government and I don't mean just the<br>politicians amongst us and there's<br>nothing wrong in fact I think it's<br>vaguely heroic to stand up and be a<br>politician to be honest it's a<br>challenging gig but what I want to say<br>to you is that political leadership has<br>to be supported by the people<br>and if political leadership is not<br>transparent if political leadership is<br>not um has has not Integrity if<br>political leadership is not understood<br>and is not founded in<br>community then political leadership will<br>fail and the reality is as you and I<br>know and I would say this standing in<br>this town the reality is that a<br>professional public service that<br>understands the realities and challenges<br>of of uh government over many many<br>generations that can advise ministers is<br>a critical component of a successful<br>government and a successful Society<br>there's a wonderful poem I I thought i'<br>better introduce a poem because I know<br>business and government audiences just<br>love poetry uh so it's a wonderful poem<br>by Yates uh which many of you will know<br>you can recite it with me if you like<br>and it goes something like this I often<br>get it wrong um<br>turning turning in the widening guia<br>that's the widening Circle the Falcon<br>cannot hear the falconer Things Fall<br>Apart the center will not hold mere<br>Anarchy is Le loosed upon the world the<br>blood dimmed tide is loosed and all the<br>celebration of Innocence are<br>drowned the best have no conviction the<br>best lack all conviction I think is the<br>actual language and the worst are full<br>of passionate intensity that's the world<br>as the pessimists would like us to see<br>it that is a real potential for our<br>world and its current condition but if<br>you like me stand in the University<br>tradition if you like me stand with the<br>graduates that we are recognizing today<br>then you cannot help but be optimistic<br>about our planet and our world and so I<br>want to say to you graduates<br>congratulations I want to say to you we<br>are putting an enormous confidence in<br>what you can bring as a consequence of<br>the education at this University to our<br>country and our future and we want to<br>wish you all the best in those future<br>endeavors and I'm going to finish with a<br>very short poem by British par called<br>Chris log uh he said this he said come<br>to the edge it is too high come to the<br>edge we might fall come to the edge and<br>they came and he pushed them and they<br>flew uh and uh I just simply want to say<br>to you we are nudged we've nudged you a<br>little at the University I hope we've<br>provoked you a little I hope uh We've<br>challenged you a little I hope and as a<br>consequence you've got the resilience<br>the confidence and the capability to<br>stand firmly on your own feet and to<br>the chancellor will now recognize the<br>graduates

to say<br>congratulations to each and every one of<br>you everyone in this room has had a<br>different journey and will go on to do<br>their own amazing things after this but<br>right now we can all share this moment<br>to celebrate the time dedication and<br>resilience that it took to complete the<br>degrees we now<br>hold that being said with all of the<br>heartbreaking news that we see coming in<br>from around the world I'd like us all to<br>take a moment and spare a thought for<br>those whose access to Safe education has<br>been taken away and recognize the<br>privilege that we have to be here today<br>celebrate as we are here looking back on<br>the last few years and all the people<br>that I've crossed paths with I know it<br>hasn't been easy for anyone after years<br>of Co Zoom lectures late nights<br>part-time jobs and walking up and down<br>the hills of Wellington I don't think<br>any of us need or want a recap so let me<br>summarize and say congratulations I see<br>your hard work and if you made it out of<br>here without a caffeine problem you've<br>done better than<br>me I would also like to express our<br>thanks from all of us in this audience<br>today to all of the staff around the<br>university for the Mahi that they do<br>without the effort and dedication of<br>everyone at this University none of us<br>would be sitting here today fresh new<br>degrees in our<br>hands so to the people of this<br>University who spent their time and<br>effort to guide support and teach us<br>thank you the work that you do is<br>important we cannot say thank you<br>enough I also want to yeah<br>absolutely I also want to take a moment<br>to acknowledge all the different people<br>that we've had supporting us through our<br>Journeys friends family teachers<br>classmates flatmates co-workers kind<br>strangers and everyone in between<br>whoever those people might be for you I<br>know that without my own support network<br>today with all of the people that I've<br>met in my time at Victoria I always love<br>to learn about the paths that they took<br>to be where they are when I look at the<br>people that I know and the friends that<br>I've made here in Wellington all of our<br>paths are so different and it's<br>incredible that I got to meet the people<br>that I did something that we can thank<br>to H Ang aaka for is acting as a conduit<br>for this a place where all types of<br>paths converge before we go on our<br>separate ways again and whatever path<br>you intend to take from here it's<br>amazing what you've achieved so<br>far when I was considering what I wanted<br>the topic of my speech to be about for<br>today I was talking to a friend of mine<br>and I was explaining that I really<br>wanted to avoid saying something cliche<br>that everyone's heard a million times<br>before and he said something very wise<br>that first I should talk about whatever<br>I want and second that cliches are<br>usually cliche for a good reason so here<br>is my cliche for all of<br>you the path that you are on regardless<br>of where you think it's going and<br>wherever it might have come from is your<br>path and you have every reason to be<br>proud of it only you know exactly where<br>you've been and what you've made it<br>through and everything that you've been<br>able to achieve because of that or maybe<br>in spite of<br>that is your part<br>and you can be proud of it proud of the<br>choices you've made and the things that<br>you've done to be where you are<br>now and a degree from Victoria<br>University is just one step on that path<br>now a step that we all have in<br>common there are many steps ahead of all<br>of us still and a million possibilities<br>for where your path might lead but I'm<br>sure we will all take the lessons that<br>we've learned from our time at Victoria<br>forwards we walk back Wards into the<br>past uh sorry backwards into the future<br>with our eyes on the past remembering<br>the lessons that we've learned and<br>taking them with<br>us as we all carry on with our lives<br>after this may we continue to learn and<br>I hope that each and every one of us can<br>find a path that we enjoy taking no<br>matter what it might look like your path<br>could take you anywhere and be anything<br>and I wish each of you all the best as<br>you continue your path k o the world is<br>yours thank you all for your time and<br>attention and enjoy the rest of the day<br>congratulations graduates<br>uh thank you Amy uh for the address uh<br>thank you for the cliches because as you<br>say the clich cliches
