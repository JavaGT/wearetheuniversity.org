her<br>seated K and welcome to this graduation<br>cereem<br>for orik the Wellington School of<br>Business and government<br>and the faculty of law I am Professor D<br>hains Deputy Vice Chancellor Mii and<br>engagement and your MC for the ceremony<br>I'm delighted you could join us this<br>afternoon to celebrate the achievements<br>of your family member friend or<br>colleague as well as being proud<br>Spectators you are also formal witnesses<br>to these official<br>proceedings a very warm welcome also to<br>farno and Friends throughout ala and<br>from across the globe viewing these<br>proceedings via our live stream I would<br>now like to introduce to you the<br>chancellor of tting aaka victoriia<br>University of<br>Wellington this is a role that dates<br>back to the Middle Ages when the first<br>universities were established the<br>chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>Direction ladies and gentleman the<br>chancellor John Allen<br>F<br>to T Koto ktoa I felt the Ripple of<br>excitement when raia said that the role<br>of Chancellor went back centuries and I<br>wondered whether some of you thought<br>that might be me uh this is an<br>institution that goes back 125 years it<br>is a university which stands in an<br>intellectual tradition which goes back<br>thousands of years and the magic of<br>universities is that in each year this<br>extraordinary thousands of years of<br>learning of all of the traditions of the<br>world all of those great faith<br>Traditions all of those great cultural<br>Traditions which is repository in the<br>heads of the brains trust sitting up<br>behind me all of that knowledge crashes<br>into well intersects sakly uh with a new<br>generation of students and that's where<br>the Alchemy of a university occurs it's<br>in the magic of bringing together all<br>that knowledge and each generation's<br>understanding of the issues which it are<br>important to it the issues which are<br>contemporary the issues which are<br>galvanizing countries and galvanizing<br>the globe now as I've already said to<br>many of you this is a celebration and<br>we're expecting a lot of noise we're<br>expecting a lot of demonstrative and<br>interpretive dance we're expecting a lot<br>of emotion today because we are<br>celebrating a significant achievement<br>and a significant milestone in your<br>lives we're recognizing the work that<br>you have done we're recognizing the<br>success that you have had and we're<br>recognizing the opportunity that that<br>success presents to take out and change<br>our world but we're also celebrating<br>your Fano and friends because we know<br>that none of us can do this together oh<br>we can all do it together we can't do it<br>on our own we all know we can't I was<br>just that was a test to see whether you<br>were listening or it had already zoned<br>out I thought there might be a few zoned<br>out there so we'll just have to pick up<br>the pace of it uh so we know that you<br>can't do this on your own we know that<br>it takes a team and we want to recognize<br>and celebrate with all your friends and<br>Faro this is a significant day and I<br>hope it is one that you will enjoy and<br>one that you will remember of course<br>there are many people who will say<br>there's not much to celebrate at the<br>moment there are many people who will<br>talk about the situation on the global<br>stage who will talk about the challenges<br>of the many crises that are confronting<br>us here in aloa because I know I've got<br>a finance audience I know there'll be<br>some of them who'll be thinking about<br>Adam Smith because most Finance people<br>think about Adam Smith most of the time<br>uh who said no Society can be<br>flourishing and happy of which the<br>greater part of members are poor and<br>miserable uh and so it is real for us to<br>be actively thinking about Solutions and<br>changes that will enable our society to<br>be more successful more prosperous and<br>enable people to achieve to their<br>potential we are apparently living in a<br>time of disillusion people are<br>apparently disillusioned with all kinds<br>of things the hope that was seen in some<br>of these great International manifestos<br>like the charter of the United Nations<br>uh which said that the purpose of that<br>institution was to save successor<br>generation from the scourge of war that<br>on two occasions when this was when the<br>document was written in 1945 had caused<br>interminable pain uh to people on our<br>planet to save the new generations from<br>the scourge of War things like the<br>Declaration of Human Rights that said<br>all people are born all people are born<br>free in rights and free and equal in<br>rights and dignity and people are losing<br>confidence about those sorts of<br>international statements of ambition and<br>whether or not they can be achieved we<br>see people looking back nostalgically<br>these are world leaders looking back<br>nostalgically at past histories and past<br>Empires and trying to reclaim them and<br>rebuild them we see philosophers and<br>there probably some in the room and some<br>in in in graduating today philosophers<br>starting to talk about Hobs again Hobs<br>and levia has leviathans that is the uh<br>demagog dos the autocrats uh because he<br>believed that in times of chaos and he<br>lived at the time when Charles first got<br>his head chopped off in times of chaos<br>you need a strong leader and we see<br>people looking even further back into<br>Greek myth and tragedy trying to<br>recognize as as the uh Greeks stood the<br>balance between Chaos and Order and how<br>you actually achieve that and there are<br>many in this world at the moment who are<br>arguing in favor of the strong leader of<br>the powerful person of the the closing<br>down of sort of democratic and liberal<br>societies and so I'm here today to tell<br>you that this University stands proudly<br>in a tradition which is open this<br>University sounds proudly in a tradition<br>which is international and this<br>University stands proudly in a in a<br>tradition which is knowledge and facts<br>based and which enjoys and cele Ates<br>debate and open<br>discussion and so the tradition that you<br>are graduating in the tradition that we<br>are celebrating is one that is very much<br>opposed to much of what we see on the<br>planet today you can be disillusioned<br>people are disillusioned there's a<br>wonderful poem uh by Ordon that some of<br>you will know September 1939 so that was<br>just at the outbreak of the uh Second<br>World War<br>and he wrote this wonderful poem uh what<br>from America where he'd gone into Exile<br>it said something like this uh<br>defenseless under the night our world<br>and stup lies but everywhere ironic<br>points of light flash out wherever the<br>just exchange their messages may like<br>may I like them composed of Iris and of<br>dust beleaguered by the same negation<br>and despair show an affirming flame and<br>so what we are doing at this univers<br>University is lighting the flame what we<br>are doing at this University is<br>affirming the light and the flame that<br>can come from an education in a<br>university of this kind so what does<br>that really mean now I know the lawyers<br>in the room will be immediately thinking<br>about the teaching and Education Act uh<br>and they'll be able to tell me in no<br>short order uh what the requirements of<br>a university are that is that we engage<br>in Higher Learning with the purpose of<br>teaching people to think for themselves<br>that is that we engage in worldclass<br>research and we engage in worldclass<br>teaching uh that is that we are a<br>repository of knowledge and expertise I<br>know that's a triggering word for some<br>people if you've been triggered by it uh<br>come and debate it with me afterwards<br>expertise is fundamental to successful<br>debate and discussion and successful<br>resolution of the challenges that are<br>confronting us and it is also says that<br>we are going to be a Critic and a<br>conscience of society so we are going to<br>stand up and we are going to assert our<br>perspectives on issues which are<br>important to this planet and to our<br>country now we have a secret Source a<br>magic um enabler uh to that which is<br>called academic freedom and academic<br>freedom allows you as students and the<br>people up behind me the academics it<br>allows them to test received wisdom it<br>allows them to propose new ideas whether<br>or not they are controversial<br>and this is a power that we as a<br>university and as a university community<br>need to grab and we need to treasure<br>because in the environment that we are<br>in in the times that we are in we are<br>going to need to assert that freedom we<br>are going to need to be that conscience<br>and<br>critic and our call to you is simply<br>this we're not despondent I am not<br>despondent I refuse to be despondent<br>because I see in front of me in<br>successive uh graduations of this kind<br>new generations who are grappling with<br>issues of your time new generations who<br>are brave and fearless and who are able<br>to understand evidence and are able to<br>debate and Advocate and get engaged and<br>are able to drive and enable change and<br>I know some people say business people<br>can't do that cuz business people are<br>all about money and business people are<br>all operating in hierarchical<br>organizations uh with uh peculiar sort<br>of mission statements and aren't<br>actually looking to change the world and<br>what I'd say is if that's your view you<br>were probably last in a business in<br>about<br>1940 uh because the businesses today are<br>mission Le the businesses today are<br>flexible the businesses today value<br>diversity and ideas and are looking to<br>change the world and I'm thinking of the<br>hundreds of businesses within 10 minutes<br>walk of this place who I know are doing<br>exactly that businesses like kogo uh<br>business like open open star uh which is<br>engaging in Fusion technology all of<br>those sorts of businesses they're the<br>businesses of the future that are<br>actually going to make a difference in<br>confronting the challenges which I've<br>just described and then those of you<br>that are going to be lawyers people will<br>be saying to me well they're no use in<br>this sort of situation lawyers cuz<br>they've learned to weigh their words<br>like ounces of butter uh they're on the<br>one hand on the other hand or we're not<br>quite sure we'll get a second opinion<br>we'll get a KC to write something about<br>it I know the sort of ambivalence uh of<br>the uh of the legal world and I want to<br>say to people who have that view that<br>lawyers have been at the Forefront of<br>all the fundamental change in this<br>country all of the Constitutional change<br>in fact lawyers at this University have<br>been at the Forefront of most of that<br>change there is a real opportunity for<br>you as legal graduates from this place<br>to make a contribution to the Future<br>shape of aloa and therefore to the<br>Future shape of our world my point to<br>you is simply this are you going to step<br>up are you going to be prepared to<br>actually stand and Advocate into this<br>challenging environment do you have the<br>courage to be able to do that and I know<br>the answer to that question I was<br>expecting a roar of affirmation I was<br>expecting a roar of affirmation but<br>there we are it was a sort of timid<br>titter but a timid titter is better than<br>nothing isn't it really a on an occasion<br>like this the reality is your generation<br>needs to step up the reality is you are<br>trained to step up and the reality is<br>the disciplines that you represent<br>whether they're in the finance and<br>Commercial world or in the Magnificent<br>traditions of the New Zealand legal<br>system are the very vehicles that can<br>make that change so we are looking to<br>you and I thought I'd finish on that<br>note with a short poem by a chck called<br>Wendell Berry Wendell is an<br>American uh poet writer thinker<br>conservationist activist uh anti-big<br>business person he wrote a book uh well<br>written many books but he wrote a poem<br>called the future uh and it goes<br>something like this I never get it quite<br>right but something like this planting<br>trees in early spring we make a place<br>for birds to sing in times to come how<br>do you know they sing there now there is<br>no other guarantee that singing will<br>ever be and what he's saying is simply<br>this that unless we create and nurture<br>the foundations that are necessary for<br>people to be able to stand and sing and<br>talk and debate and engage in the issues<br>of our time unless we do that and we<br>know that the university can and does do<br>that then we can't<br>guarantee that singing will continue or<br>ever be these institutions the<br>universities are TAA these universities<br>deserve respect and engagement with our<br>community and with our country they<br>deserve funding frankly uh rather that's<br>a small political comment uh rather<br>are so get out there and demonstrate to<br>the government<br>uh actually I could probably stop there<br>couldn't I I wasn't quite what I meant<br>but nonetheless get out there and show<br>the government that the investment that<br>they make in these people in this<br>institution across our country is an<br>investment that pays unbelievable<br>dividends and help them understand that<br>if they're going to tackle the<br>challenges that we are confronting they<br>cannot do it by taking some isolationist<br>narrow position they need to engage<br>meaningfully with the world I wish you<br>well in doing that I'm hugely excited<br>and optimistic about the potential that<br>you represent no ten Koto KY<br>ten going to invite the chancellor back<br>to the the podium and the chancellor<br>will now recognize the graduates as<br>listed in the graduation program will<br>all degree diploma and certificate<br>graduates please stand that's all of you<br>if you're coming up on the stage you<br>need to stand up now it's a it's a good<br>idea cuz this is this is when you<br>actually<br>graduate I John Allen Chancellor of<br>taring aaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington

the<br>diverse ways of understanding the world<br>and research is one of those key<br>contributions that we can make to<br>society as many people here will be<br>aware our doctoral graduates achieve<br>academically at the very highest level<br>and their research has provided insights<br>in some some of the major and<br>existential questions that Society<br>currently faces as the chancellor<br>highlighted it's increasingly difficult<br>in a contemporary World often to<br>separate expertise from opinion the<br>challenge of how we use evidence how we<br>speak with the humility that allows us<br>all to listen and how we do that in a<br>respectful en environment that debates<br>those important topics are key and these<br>graduates have spent several years<br>learning exactly that craft they can<br>help us understand the past the present<br>and possible Futures they're independent<br>thinkers and makers who actively engage<br>AS Global Citizens for all those reasons<br>we're very proud to know them the short<br>summary that I'll now share gives only a<br>glimpse of the impact and innovation of<br>this work however it does show the<br>significant issues

law<br>graduate at Simpson gron in a eagerly<br>awaiting the release of her documentary<br>web series about how disabled people use<br>the internet that she created late last<br>year with disability media platform the<br>D<br>listak ladies and Gentlemen please<br>welcome Alice to give The Graduate<br>address<br>Koto C good afternoon University<br>graduates staff Faro family and friends<br>I'm honored to be before you today as<br>your graduate speaker as we celebrate<br>this immense achievement and join<br>multigenerational cohort of Victoria<br>University graduates and David mclin<br>survivors when I reflect on the person I<br>was when I started this journey in<br>2018 and the person I am today I<br>realized that the way I see and<br>experience the world could not be more<br>different for one I think I finally<br>graduated from Clean Skin wine and I've<br>accepted that Oriental kingdom is<br>probably not the best boo venue in in<br>town but I also know that I can speak to<br>you all as a disabled woman and be proud<br>of that fact I know that the world is<br>much bigger than I thought and that not<br>all people arrive at University with the<br>same levels of support that I had I know<br>that many students are working part-time<br>to supplement their M student loans or<br>look after F and children and I know<br>that the law as an institution and alter<br>is ripe with Colonial attitudes and<br>biases<br>and when I think of all these things I<br>know the things I learned during my<br>studies I realize that University really<br>isn't about what we learn but how we<br>learn to see the<br>world and I think that when our<br>understanding of the world changes we<br>begin to realize that the world itself<br>is capable of changing<br>too if covid-19 taught us anything it's<br>that we are a resilient generation and<br>that we can change the way we do things<br>we might just need a push in the right<br>Direction university has has encouraged<br>me to do the pushing it's probably one<br>of the few places I can disagree with<br>many lecturers by campaigning about<br>lecture recordings or speak in the media<br>about ableism and higher education and<br>still be asked back as The Graduate<br>speaker so as cliche as it sounds we<br>don't just graduate today with degrees<br>or a better understanding of law or<br>business but also with an ability to see<br>the world as it is and and imagine it as<br>it could<br>be and as I learned in Luke's Treaty of<br>wangi class imagination is one of the<br>best tools we have in the fight for a<br>better<br>future and it's because of this that we<br>see attempts to silence our imagination<br>all across the world whether it be<br>inequitable educational outcomes cuts to<br>universities by uncaring governments or<br>attempts to silence people across the<br>world protesting against an illegal<br>occupation and genocide<br>as we move into the next stage of Our<br>Lives I ask that we hold on to this<br>ability to imagine and protect the right<br>for others to do so<br>too and so I want to thank those<br>lecturers and Shooters who helped us to<br>imagine it would be impossible to name<br>them all but personally M Iddy AET and<br>Luke thank you for opening my eyes to a<br>new way of studying the law and in the<br>process helping me believe in the<br>contribution I can make as a disabled<br>woman in legal Academia<br>but I also want to thank the staff that<br>probably aren't here today but what part<br>are part of what keeps this University<br>running like the administrative staff<br>especially the one who had me crying<br>down the phone when she asked if I<br>wanted to do tax law sorry to John<br>Preble but also the security staff and<br>cleaning staff who always stopped to say<br>hi and ask how my day was and of course<br>we couldn't have had the space to<br>imagine if not for the other important<br>people who helped us along the way<br>to our families we wouldn't be here<br>today without your support patience and<br>unwavering belief I want to thank my<br>family personally for accepting my dream<br>of moving to Wellington despite it being<br>the steepest and least successible<br>city thank you for learning to let me<br>fight my own battles but always being<br>willing to proofread my<br>essays to my friends and loved ones<br>thank you for your never-ending love and<br>support and for making sure I had fun<br>even in the depths of studying and<br>exams and finally to my fellow graduates<br>thank you for inspiring me every day<br>know that whether it took you 3 years 5<br>years six years like me or more you<br>nailed it and I know that whatever you<br>do from today on you're going to nail<br>that too and for many of you you that<br>probably starts at the Old Bailey so go<br>uh thank you thank you Alice uh as a<br>fellow David mlin<br>Survivor uh there was much in your<br>narrative that I uh I admired and which<br>resonated with me in particular the<br>importance of imagination the importance<br>of never forgetting what the future can<br>be and the courage and determination to<br>make the changes that are necessary to<br>deliver that Vision uh and I want to<br>just salute the work that you have done<br>uh for the disabled community in ALA I<br>want to salute the work that you've
