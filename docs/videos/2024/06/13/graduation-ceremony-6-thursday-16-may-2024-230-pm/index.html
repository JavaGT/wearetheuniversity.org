aop<br>faculty of education<br>and faculty of humanities and social<br>sciences I am Professor daan Higgins<br>Deputy Vice Chancellor Marty and<br>engagement and your MC for this ceremony<br>I'm delighted you could join us this<br>afternoon to celebrate the achievements<br>of your Foo member friend or colleague<br>as well as being proud Spectators you<br>are also formal witnesses to these<br>official<br>proceedings a very warm welcome also to<br>farno and Friends throughout ala and<br>from across the globe viewing these<br>proceedings via our live<br>stream I would now like to introduce to<br>you the chancellor of toing aaka<br>Victoria University of Wellington this<br>is a role that dates back to the Middle<br>Ages when the first universities were<br>established the chancellor is the chair<br>of the University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>Direction the chancellor John Allen<br>inoo John Ellen to inoa and it's my very<br>great pleasure as Chancellor of taring<br>aaka Victoria University of Wellington<br>to welcome you to this celebration it is<br>a celebration it is a party it is a<br>recognition of our graduates their work<br>their achievement and what they are<br>going to do in the world from here it is<br>a celebration of all those who have been<br>with you on that Journey your friends<br>Faro classmates Associates many of whom<br>I know are in the auditorium and will be<br>looking to uh celebrate as you walk<br>across the stage it is a celebration of<br>those within the taringa Waka Community<br>our academic and professional staff who<br>have been with you on this journey<br>cajoling you guiding you sometimes<br>activating you uh to be to ultimately<br>achieve uh this level of success and it<br>is a statement about the importance of<br>universities in our community in our<br>country at this time I know that there<br>are plenty of people who want to write<br>universities off there are people who<br>say that we're yesterday's sort of<br>program there are people who think that<br>we're some sort of out ofd medieval sect<br>I have to say I have some sympathy with<br>that view as we sort of wander in in our<br>in our in our Garb but the truth of the<br>magic of a university is this that we<br>stand in thousands of years of tradition<br>of Ed education of cultural heritage of<br>uh the great traditions of religion<br>across our globe and all of that<br>knowledge is locked up in the minds and<br>heads of the brains trust that's sitting<br>behind me and then the incredible thing<br>is this that every year there's a new<br>group of students who come and Clash<br>into all of that knowledge or they<br>delicately Mel into all of that<br>knowledge clashing as terribly last<br>those sort of 80s uh de they delicately<br>meld into all of that knowledge and<br>that's where the Alchemy of the<br>University occurs that's where we get<br>the creativity that's where we get the<br>energy that's where we get the new<br>thinking and that's why universities<br>continue to be enormously relevant uh at<br>these times now I know that many of you<br>would say that celebrations at the<br>moment are misplaced that there's so<br>much going on in our world and in our<br>country that is challenging to all of us<br>we know of Wars we know of climate<br>change we know of all kinds of crises in<br>relation to housing or health that are<br>impacting so many uh across our<br>community and we know that those<br>challenges are going to involve<br>significant effort from all of us uh to<br>address over the next period people are<br>we are told disillusioned people are<br>writing books called the end times or<br>the age of revolution<br>people are increasingly retreating to an<br>environment of strong leaders as they<br>see them dictators as some would see<br>them uh because they feel those people<br>are going to give them security Now the<br>extraordinary thing about that is that<br>the disciplines represented in this room<br>today all of your learning all of your<br>teaching is going to be directed against<br>that narra<br>clear because I want to be clear that<br>this University stands for a very<br>different world this University stands<br>in a world where people are encouraged<br>and able to think for themselves not<br>directed from Wellington or anywhere<br>else this University stands in the<br>tradition that respect<br>scholarship learning and expertise and<br>recognizes the role that that plays in<br>informing Progressive discussion and<br>might I salute in that mode the people<br>in red in the front row here our<br>yeah I know that there are people now<br>who don't think expertise matters who<br>think here reckon that they've just<br>tweeted in some moment of extraordinary<br>fabulousness uh is up to the five six<br>seven years maybe more of dedicated<br>study that it takes to get a PhD and you<br>and I know that if we're going to<br>address the challenges that I've just<br>articulated and the many more that are<br>confronting us the reckons are not going<br>to be enough we need deep expertise we<br>need to listen to deep expertise we need<br>to learn from Deep expertise and we need<br>to encourage Generations that are coming<br>after us to develop that expertise<br>because that is where the solutions to<br>these challenges are going to be found<br>now the truth about universities uh is<br>that we are designed to do a few things<br>it's a legal construct you can go to the<br>Education and Training act and you can<br>see these things the first is we have to<br>train people to think for themselves<br>that is one of our statutory obligations<br>the second is we have to be a repository<br>of expertise and knowledge uh the third<br>is we have to do International class<br>teaching and learning the fourth is that<br>we have to be prepared to act as a<br>Critic and conscience of society and<br>then and here's the most extraordinary<br>thing we have the superpower given to us<br>in the legislation it's called academic<br>freedom and what that allows is for<br>students and academics to question<br>received wisdom to propose new ideas<br>even if they are unpopular or<br>controversial and so we as an<br>institution and you as the products of<br>this institution hold many of the skills<br>required to combat the negativity the<br>dictatorial ism the anti- educational<br>ISM or intelligence that we see in so<br>much of the narrative across our country<br>at the moment we know that AI can be a<br>powerful good but we also know that Ai<br>and deep fakes and all that stuff can<br>explode society and push people to the<br>fringes we need the center to be strong<br>and the university stands unashamedly in<br>the center the university stands<br>unashamedly for a society in which<br>everybody has the opportunity to<br>participate to achieve to their best you<br>know the great narratives of the uh un<br>Charter for example or the Declaration<br>of Human Rights the UN Charter which<br>said to save the world from the scourge<br>of War we are doing several things<br>setting up the UN that was the San<br>Francisco Conference in 1945 the<br>Declaration of Human Rights says all<br>people are born free and equal in rights<br>and dignity and if you are not excited<br>by those sorts of Visions if you're not<br>excited by what the potential of those<br>um particular messages is then you're in<br>the wrong place uh because this is an<br>environment in which we want to<br>collectively harness the passions the<br>powers and the opportunities of all<br>people there's a there's a poem uh<br>there's a poem called fear of change I<br>wasn't necessarily going to use it but<br>it'll go in here nicely I think I always<br>I never get it quite right so if you<br>know it many of you will just interject<br>if I get it slightly wrong um it goes<br>something like this if you and I if you<br>and I were woken by the Drums of<br>revolution in the street or suppose the<br>door flew open and there stood a young<br>bull fighter with a skin of rough red<br>wine offering us all death sex hope or<br>even an earthquake causing the uh roof<br>to shake the trees to Rattle calling us<br>all loudly to consider God let us admit<br>with no shame whatever we're not that<br>sort of people we've learned to weigh<br>our words like ounces of butter our<br>skillers for anger and monotony<br>therefore we'll survive the singers the<br>dancers the starcross lovers will bury<br>them all and spend a long wet weekend<br>arguing whether the copses were dressed<br>in black or red now something like that<br>reason oh yeah<br>yeah the reason I like that poem is not<br>simply because I like the idea that<br>we've got people who are speaking with<br>you know uh speaking on the one hand on<br>the other hand weighing their words like<br>ounces of butter and we we're doing<br>something about that because that is not<br>the sort of advocacy that this<br>University wants that is not the sort of<br>advocacy that this country needs what I<br>love is just a simple proposition what<br>are you going to do when you door flies<br>open and there's a young bull fighter<br>and there's the question to you all what<br>are you going to do what are you going<br>to do when you're confronted by the<br>extraordinary opportunities that are<br>ahead of you what are you going to do<br>when there's an explosive OPP<br>opportunity for creativity and change<br>that you can be part of are you going to<br>lean into that or are you going to run<br>away from it because we know that we<br>need creativity and there's so much<br>creativity in this room we know that we<br>need new energy and new thinking and<br>there's so much of that in this room but<br>to do that you need to lean into change<br>to do that you've got to be prepared to<br>stand up and to speak to do that you've<br>got to be able uh to articulate your<br>views and defend your views in what can<br>sometimes be challenging in contested<br>space and what I'd say to you is the<br>reason I am optimistic despite all the<br>challenges that we have on our planet<br>and in our world the reason I am<br>optimistic is because I know you have<br>the schools to do that more than that I<br>know that the disciplines in which<br>you're engaged education uh various<br>elements of creativity and communication<br>music and writing are exactly the<br>elements that the potential to confront<br>those oligarchs uh and to draw our<br>society together we can tell different<br>stories I should just recognize and<br>saying that Emily Perkins uh who won an<br>extraordinary award in Oakland uh uh<br>yesterday last night uh and just<br>recognize her and the team at the IML uh<br>for the remarkable work they do in<br>articulating different stories uh in<br>this place we can use music to bring us<br>together you all know uh that if you<br>want to put someone off War get them to<br>listen to the Britain war requium I know<br>you all know that well if you don't know<br>that that's a really good piece of<br>advice if you get someone who's a bit<br>hot-headed on the sort of Waring sort of<br>space give them the Iliad to read that's<br>a good start uh because I can tell you<br>that the Iliad will put them off as well<br>but second get them to listen to the<br>Britain requium which sets to music<br>Wilfred owens's poems or many of Wilfred<br>'s poems and as the most heart-rending<br>depressing extraordinary experience<br>and once you'd listen to that and read<br>The Iliad you'd be going nowhere near<br>War ever ever ever again and no sensible<br>be and if you're a and if you're an<br>oligarch and there might be some nent<br>oligarchs in the room or you've got some<br>sort of sympathy for oligarchical<br>thinking uh then can I recommend Shelly<br>To You O amandus uh you'll remember that<br>that that's the one about the about the<br>Statue standing in the desert<br>uh that's fallen over and decrepit and<br>standing in a vast plane with absolutely<br>nothing around it and on the pins my<br>name is as O amandus King of Kings look<br>upon my wonders and desp the sorry I'll<br>try again I am O amandus King of Kings<br>look upon my wonders all ye Mighty and<br>despair and there's just a great desert<br>around oie mandus that he's sort of<br>crushed and fallen and that's the<br>reality for these people they're stuffed<br>and so can I simply say to you uh<br>congratulations it is<br>a it is extraordinary that you have<br>achieved what you have but no pressure<br>this is the beginning uh and we expect<br>to see action now on the basis of what<br>you've learned we need you to act we<br>want you to act we want to act with you<br>we know you've got the tools you know<br>now something even more exciting than<br>that and I mean that quite<br>sincerely thank<br>you just give me half a second just<br>catch your breath and get ready for the<br>next round of singing dancing and wild<br>partying uh as Chancellor of

poetry<br>energy<br>excitement<br>Enlightenment I think you can all<br>appreciate the<br>alliteration around the importance of<br>University<br>and this afternoon is our final<br>graduation ceremony and I'm going to let<br>you into a<br>favorite and it's not just because of<br>the energy in the room although that is<br>fantastic as ra ronia commented at the<br>beginning of the ceremony it's also<br>because as John has highlighted Your<br>Capacity to bring respect to debate in<br>ways that preserves relationships to<br>bring evidence in a way that in uh<br>underpins understanding but also<br>captures the humility required to both<br>talk and listen to some of the<br>challenges that we have in time and as<br>John exalted you and exalts me regularly<br>that is important to acknowledge that<br>joy and it is important to sing and<br>important to dance and important to<br>celebrate in that space it is advice I<br>take very seriously and do<br>regularly but for the benefit of both<br>yourselves and often my family I hold it<br>on the<br>side but in no way does that diminish uh<br>the contribution and the excitement that<br>we have as John has already acknowledged<br>the people in the front and the red<br>gowns are at that very academic Pinnacle<br>they are key to that process of<br>enriching knowledge and creativity and<br>the diverse ways of under understanding<br>the world their research has provided<br>insights into not just major but<br>increasingly existential questions that<br>Society faces they are experts at that<br>increasingly important and challenging<br>skill of separating expertise from<br>opinion and they have spent years<br>learning that craft they can help us<br>understand not just the past or the<br>present but the possible Futures and<br>understand that in a way that perhaps we<br>can make slightly better choices than<br>some of our political demagogy are doing<br>at this point in time they're<br>independent thinkers and makers who are<br>active and engaged Global Citizens We're<br>very proud to know them and we're very<br>much looking forward to them leaving the<br>institution staying in touch but making<br>the kinds of impacts that we've just<br>heard about the short citations that<br>I'll now share give only a very small<br>glimpse of the impact and innovation of<br>their work but I do however hope they<br>show the significant issues that the<br>next generation of Scholars<br>professionals and teachers are<br>pursuing with the doctor of Education<br>please come<br>fedel cognitive behavioral therapy is a<br>widely used approach to help individuals<br>resolve dysfunctional thoughts and<br>feelings Chris evaluated the use of a<br>particular cognitive based coaching<br>program aimed Secondary School students<br>he investigated both how to train<br>coaches in schools and the effects of<br>the programs on the students themselves<br>his work suggests that the program is<br>both feasible to roll out in secondary<br>school and has promising impacts on<br>students but that more work could and<br>perhaps should be done to boost its<br>effects on academic achievement<br>Chancellor I present Chris Fido to the<br>degree of doctor of Education<br>with the doctors of philosophy please<br>come<br>BS light verse is a mode of poetry that<br>encompasses satire

University<br>thank you so very much for honoring me<br>with this award I am truly very humbled<br>and moved by<br>it in particular in honoring me you<br>honor all public servants and the spirit<br>of service to the community that they<br>bring to their work every day thank you<br>for doing that thank you so<br>much Victoria University is one of the<br>great Ed educational institutions of the<br>world and I'm a I am hugely proud to be<br>a graduate of this University to have<br>worked here as a professor and head of<br>school and now proud to be be receiving<br>this<br>award so let me start with those of you<br>graduating<br>today and I know what that feels like<br>because 43 years ago I was<br>you I was sitting down there I think in<br>the middle somewhere over there with the<br>Bachelors of<br>Arts uh and that was an absolutely great<br>feeling but never in a million years did<br>I ever think I would be back here doing<br>this today probably because I didn't<br>think I'd live to be this<br>old and certainly if I had I would have<br>been much better<br>behaved The Bachelor of Arts can we have<br>raise your hands Bachelors of Arts can<br>we have a round of applause for The<br>arts for each of you just as it was for<br>me today marks the end of a journey and<br>as the chancellor said the beginning of<br>a new one each of you has gotten here<br>through hard work sacrifice commitment<br>persistence<br>uh and a ton of<br>Courage each of you has earned the<br>achievement we are celebrating today you<br>have put yourselves on the line to get<br>here and please know this whatever<br>happens in your life no one can ever<br>take that achievement away from<br>you and so I congratulate each and every<br>one of you on your achievement and I<br>thank you for having the courage to<br>Aspire to<br>it what's important now is what you do<br>with what what you've<br>achieved for myself I chose Public<br>Service as my career and I can honestly<br>say that I have not ever not even for<br>one day regretted that<br>choice you will each make your own<br>well so 43 years ago the same year I<br>graduated I signed on to the permanent<br>staff of the department of social<br>welfare I started at the very bottom a<br>basic grade Clark they called us basics<br>for short and that's<br>true it wasn't a great<br>start the assistant director benefits<br>and pensions wrote on my probation<br>report Peter would benefit from learning<br>to curb his natural exuberance in the<br>matters well I never quite managed that<br>and look where it got<br>me never ever be afraid to question<br>things starting out as a basic grade<br>clerk in the department of social<br>welfare it never occurred to me ever<br>that one day I might end up running the<br>place let alone the entire Public<br>Service<br>itself in Wellington district office the<br>top dog was the district<br>director now I knew who he was because I<br>had to sign his name on correspondence<br>Mr<br>lambi I saw him a a handful of times but<br>I don't literally don't ever remember<br>speaking to him and when I got promoted<br>to a junior roll in head office the top<br>dog was the director general of social<br>welfare Mr<br>Grant one day I stepped into the lift<br>and he was right there in front of me Mr<br>Grant and I<br>froze and then years later of course I<br>became him when I became head of the<br>department<br>myself again one day I was in the lift<br>when the doors opened and young woman<br>got in she looked at me and she<br>froze oh she said it's<br>you yes I said it's<br>me I would have thought you would have<br>said I wish I said in my<br>head for me Mr lambi and Mr Grant were<br>incredibly powerful<br>people but during the whole time I've<br>held these sorts of jobs I've never won<br>once felt that but I have always felt<br>responsible all of the time every day<br>every week and I felt responsible<br>high every day of the working week<br>public servants right across New Zealand<br>get up leave their families and their<br>homes get on buses trains into cars and<br>come to<br>work and what they do touches the the<br>lives of every single New Zealander our<br>families and our<br>communities and they do that mostly<br>because they care and because they want<br>difference and I have to say I really do<br>believe in that I really do believe in<br>the ideal of Public Service I believe in<br>the spirit of service to the community<br>that our Public Service Act talks about<br>I believe that it is a noble thing to<br>choose to serve your country and its<br>citizens and I believe that public<br>service is something we should<br>acknowledge celebrate and<br>reward and it saddens me when that is<br>not the<br>case we need our public sector to be<br>efficient to deliver services that<br>people can rely on to drive the best<br>outcomes and to be future<br>focused but the Beating Heart of all of<br>that and more is the people who choose<br>public service and why they are<br>there I believe that you get the best<br>out of people by appealing to the best<br>in people and in the public sector<br>that's the spirit of service that people<br>bring to their<br>work when we're able to harness that<br>Spirit connect it to the needs of<br>citizens and communities and Empower<br>people to make a difference that's when<br>the magic<br>happens that's when lives are<br>changed the spirit of service that our<br>public servants bring to their work is a<br>tonger in our nation and as the Public<br>Service Act says we ought to preserve<br>protect and nurture<br>it Public Service of course is not<br>confined to the public service<br>itself our political leaders are public<br>servants our judges are public servants<br>our teachers and School principles are<br>public servants many of you do voluntary<br>work in the community that is public<br>service some of you serve on school<br>boards that is public<br>service and to that work you bring a<br>spirit of service to your<br>communities whatever it is that you<br>choose to do with your lives you will<br>have opportunities through Public<br>Service Embrace those opportunities<br>public service will enrich your lives<br>we should remember those who got us here<br>each of you graduating today is<br>privileged to have attended this<br>University and to have learned from the<br>academic staff and students here and so<br>to the staff of the University I say<br>thank you so very much<br>back in 1981 I nearly didn't make<br>graduation I decided not to go it was<br>all a bit to establishment you'll<br>remember well you won't remember but<br>this was the<br>80s and establishment was not the place<br>to<br>be that was until my father intervened<br>and he informed me that I was going to<br>graduation and that I was going to go<br>for my mother and for our family and of<br>course he was right because until that<br>point i' thought it was all about me not<br>about anybody<br>else whatever our own talents none of us<br>is able to do what we do in our work and<br>in our lives without the love and<br>support of our parents Partners families<br>and

good afternoon<br>everyone esteemed faculty proud family<br>friends and fellow graduates today marks<br>a significant milestone in our lives a<br>moment of Celebration reflection and<br>transition as we stand here on the cusp<br>of a new chapter I'm filled with immense<br>gratitude and a sense of nostalgia for<br>the journey that has brought us here I'm<br>sure that since completing our studies<br>many of you like me have been focused on<br>what comes next new jobs new apartments<br>maybe travel meeting new people and<br>starting a new phase of life however<br>let's pause for a moment to consider the<br>significance of this graduation for us<br>what we have truly accomplished and how<br>much progress we have made think back to<br>how daunting the campus felt on your<br>orientation day or the feeling of<br>frantically searching for a familiar<br>face in the lecture hall the times<br>getting lost trying to find your way<br>around campus or the hours spent<br>grappling with Chicago referencing only<br>to realize that you're supposed to use<br>APA reflecting on these moments we can<br>appreciate how how far we have come<br>thank you to those whove guided us along<br>this journey the lecturers and the staff<br>your wisdom encouragement and unwavering<br>support empowered us to think critically<br>explore new ideas pursue our goals of<br>determination you inspired us led us and<br>expanded Our World Views one lecture at<br>a time thank you for the passion you<br>brought for the questions you answered<br>the knowledge you imparted onto us and<br>of course the extensions that you<br>granted also an acknowledgement to<br>Victoria University to those who work<br>behind the scenes to keep the wheels<br>turning and to those who handle the big<br>picture Logistics to enable us to focus<br>on studying thank you for carrying us<br>through an uncertain time the years<br>after the pandemic brought some huge<br>challenges and your persistence is<br>appreciated how lucky we are to be able<br>to attend this<br>ceremony and of course a big shout out<br>to our families and friends who have<br>been our biggest cheerleaders you've<br>enjoyed our stress celebrated our<br>successes and helped us see the bigger<br>picture when things got tough today we<br>share this achievement with you what<br>truly brings us to this moment though is<br>ourselves we did it it's a culmination<br>of perseverance dedication and diligence<br>it was a daily choice to show up and do<br>the work to attend those lengthy<br>three-hour lectures juggle part-time<br>jobs and to sacrifice other activities<br>to finish assignments it was also<br>navigating the unexpected changes<br>summoning the courage to make<br>connections and of course walking out<br>that huge hill they say life isn't<br>measured in the amount of Breath You<br>Take but the are moments that take your<br>breath away and boy walking up that hell<br>Each Day My Breath was certainly taken<br>away I have to say that is one thing I<br>won't<br>miss on a more serious note we here as<br>graduates of the faculty of humanities<br>and social sciences are equipped to<br>create a more informed Society<br>Linguistics Communications music media<br>and the Arts these disciplines are<br>essential for cultural enrichment and<br>societal progress they encourage<br>creativity discourse and understanding<br>these topics are a fundamental aspect of<br>human existence and as for my fellow<br>faculty of Education graduates we have<br>the power to spark Innovation and uplift<br>the Learners of tomorrow let us use this<br>privilege to nurture the potential in<br>each individual regardless of background<br>or their<br>circumstance overall completing our<br>studies is much more than a<br>certification or a piece of paper it is<br>a show of resilience a recognition of<br>hard work focus and commitment something<br>to commemorate the time we've had<br>together the friends we've made the<br>things we've learned the paths we've<br>walked being at Victoria University to<br>heading on Walker changed me and I bet<br>you can say the same too
