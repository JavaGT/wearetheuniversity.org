first<br>universities were established the<br>chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>Direction please welcome the chancellor<br>John<br>elleno T<br>Kota tato I felt the Ripple of<br>excitement when you heard that someone<br>from the Middle Ages uh who cheered some<br>sort of opaque committee uh was going to<br>uh speak to you but I'm delighted as<br>Chancellor of taring aaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington to welcome you<br>to this celebration it is a celebration<br>that means we're going to have singing<br>and dancing that means interpretive<br>dance is encouraged that means Joy<br>should be expressed because we're<br>celebrating your achievements graduates<br>we're celebrating the work that you have<br>put in we're celebrating the journey<br>that you have come through and we're<br>celebrating the Triumph that we're<br>recognizing today of your graduating<br>from this fantastic<br>yeah you can pce yourselves with the<br>sort of energy because you know this<br>goes on for a little while uh we're also<br>we're also uh celebrating the friends<br>Fara family all of those in your<br>communities that have supported you on<br>that journey and we're recognizing the<br>contribution that they have made in your<br>lives and to your success and we're<br>celebrating the extraordinary academic<br>and professional staff of this<br>institution who have nudged you joled<br>you encouraged you and ultimately got<br>you uh to the position where you able to<br>graduate today<br>now you know this is also a recognition<br>of the value of universities in<br>contemporary Society I know there are<br>people who write them off there are<br>people who say that universities have no<br>relevance but the truth is that the<br>magic of a university is that we stand<br>in thousands of years of learning<br>tradition the great faith Traditions the<br>great cultural traditions of the globe<br>uh are locked up in the brains trust uh<br>sitting behind me the academics of our<br>University the people who have that<br>knowledge that expertise uh which we<br>celebrate and value and the elkomy The<br>Wonder of a university is that each year<br>a new generation of students comes to<br>this place and collides with all of that<br>knowledge well sort of intermingles in a<br>delicate way uh intermingles in a<br>delicate way with all of that knowledge<br>bringing their contemporary issues the<br>Contemporary issues of your time the<br>things that are concerning you and the<br>people around you the issues of the day<br>and that is where the magic of a<br>university occurs where the creativity<br>of a university occurs where the<br>understanding and insight and Innovation<br>uh that an that only a university can<br>provide uh is generated it is an<br>extraordinary place and it is needed in<br>these extraordinary times because you<br>and I know uh that there's lots of<br>people who wouldn't say there's much to<br>celebrate at the moment you and I know<br>that there were people who would talk<br>about war and would talk about climate<br>and would talk about the various crises<br>that are impacting health education and<br>so many other features of our society<br>there are people who would talk about<br>new technologies that are forcing people<br>apart rather than bringing them together<br>they'd talk about fake news they'd talk<br>about deep fakes we in a university<br>stand against that narrative this<br>this University and particularly the<br>disciplines represented here recognize<br>that to understand today you need to<br>understand yesterday to understand us<br>you need to understand all the cultures<br>of the world to understand the<br>challenges that we are collectively<br>facing you need to be read into the<br>great religious Traditions the great<br>story and cultural traditions of the<br>peoples of the world this group<br>represents the heart of our University<br>which is a Humanities and social<br>sciences University but it does that in<br>a particular way it does it recognizing<br>the continuing contributions that the<br>disciplines you represent the work you<br>have done the extraordinary study and<br>expertise pie that's been developed by<br>all the phds that we're going to<br>recognize today all of that Insight is<br>actually what is needed to address many<br>of the challenges and Troubles of this<br>world uh you know right at the moment uh<br>yates's poem Oh a bit of poetry you got<br>to have a bit of poetry this is<br>Humanities after all uh so I thought I'd<br>use yates's poem um Second Coming uh<br>just the not the whole thing cuz that<br>would be a bit much now I never get it<br>quite right and I know there'll be<br>people here not better than I do so if I<br>get a wrong word just interject just<br>shout out and you can just continue<br>that's just fine uh but the poem goes<br>something like this turning turning in<br>the widening gu which is a circle old<br>word for a circle the Falcon cannot hear<br>the falconer Things Fall Apart the<br>center cannot hold mere Anarchy is<br>leashed leashed upon the world the blood<br>done tide is loosed and all the<br>ceremonies of Innocence are drowned the<br>the best lack all conviction while the<br>worst are filled with passionate<br>intensity in my mind that poem speaks<br>volumes about our society a society that<br>in many ways is splintering a society<br>that in many ways is falling apart where<br>people can't talk to each other or won't<br>talk to each other where the reckons of<br>an individual is seen as superior to the<br>expertise of a PhD where people won't<br>read creatively there isn't the contest<br>of ideas that forms the heart of<br>University thinking and so what I am<br>saying to you is that the disciplines<br>you have studied the disciplines you are<br>now graduating in in my mind hold the<br>key to Bringing things back together<br>they<br>hope they hold the key because if you<br>want to put someone off going to war get<br>them to read the ilot if you want to put<br>someone off going to war get them to<br>listen to um Britain's Great War requium<br>or shostakovich's 13th it's that sort of<br>music that sort of language which will<br>seize those despots by the throat or<br>even maybe by the heart if they have one<br>and change the course and trajectory of<br>their thinking get them to read shell o<br>amandus you know I met a traveler from<br>antique time there was that great statue<br>standing in the desert uh nothing around<br>it except the amazing words on the<br>plinth I am O amandus King of Kings look<br>ye on my Works uh ye Mighty and despair<br>and there it was absolutely shattered a<br>wreck in the desert with just the low<br>and bloming Sands going for Miles all<br>around cuz we know because we study this<br>stuff that this is all fleeting we know<br>that these powerful bodies come and go<br>we understand history we understand uh<br>The rhythms and patterns of History we<br>understand the thinkers ofil thinkings<br>of philosophers and so we can<br>confidently say these things too will<br>pass but we need to be able to confront<br>them in our time and so that's why poets<br>matter that's why writers matter that's<br>why artists matter because in our time<br>you are called to express<br>courageously challenge to those who<br>would close down intellectual<br>imagination who want Conformity who see<br>death rather than opportunity in human<br>life who want to pull us apart rather<br>than bring us together it is the artists<br>who are going to enable us and the<br>social scientists who will help us<br>understand how to make that work but I<br>want to recognize today that the work<br>you have done the gr the um<br>qualifications that you will now get<br>from this<br>University start you on a track to<br>making a contribution to that<br>International and National debate to add<br>your voice your intellect your<br>independent thinking to to that<br>chorus because the truth is that despite<br>the passions of one or two individuals<br>despite the fact there are disillusioned<br>people going to strong leaders the great<br>calls of documents like the UN Charter<br>which said to save the world from the<br>scourge of War we're going to combine<br>we're going to work together you can<br>understand the disillusionment given<br>where we are today or the Declaration of<br>Human Rights which says all people<br>Are Born Free and equal in rights and<br>dignity and you can look around the<br>world and see so many examples where<br>that is not occurring but we should not<br>be defeatist we cannot be defeatist we<br>need to be active we need to be involved<br>we need to be awake to the challenges<br>and to the opportunities and when I look<br>on the graduates here<br>today I can be confident of that future<br>no pressure but I know that you can<br>force back all of the stuff I know that<br>you've been educated to think for<br>yourselves that you've been educated to<br>think about research and facts to base<br>your convictions I know that you're<br>brave to stand up and advocate for the<br>things that matter to you and to us<br>collectively I know that because the<br>university does that and I know it does<br>that because we're required to by<br>law but what we really do is not just<br>apply the law<br>we unleash human potential and so in<br>that Spirit can I congratulate you uh I<br>thought I'd end with a very short poem<br>uh by a British poet called Chris Logue<br>uh and uh who actually wrote a<br>magnificent sort of um translation of<br>The Iliad called war music uh anyway<br>don't that's just a diversion in case<br>you want to uh want to read it and just<br>before I go to my that peration I just<br>one other thing I want to say in<br>graduating from this University you<br>stand in an extraordinary tradition uh a<br>tradition that includes many many great<br>musicians writers thinkers uh who have<br>taken our country on a great journey I<br>simply want to recognize Emily Perkins<br>teachers<br>yeah and if you haven't read lioness go<br>out and buy it it's a it's a really good<br>read uh and it talks to contemporary<br>times and talks to contemporary<br>relationships and I just wanted to<br>salute Emily and I'd not done that when<br>I should have in my uh uh in my address<br>so now now to Chris log uh he said this<br>come to the edge we might fall come to<br>the edge it's too high come to the edge<br>and they came and he pushed them and<br>they F flew uh and I wish you all the<br>flight the chancellor will now recognize<br>the graduates as listed in the<br>graduation program will all degrees<br>diploma and certificate graduates please<br>stand that's all of you who are coming<br>up on the stage you need to stand up<br>this is quite important because it's<br>graduate uh I John Ellen Chancellor of<br>taring aaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington would like to formal formally<br>recognize the persons whose names are<br>entered in the presentation of graduates<br>the degrees diplomas and certificates<br>they appearing and confirm that they<br>have been admitted to these degrees<br>diplomas and certificates in this<br>University congratul ations to you all<br>as graduates you may now put on your<br>trenches<br>seated we now move on to honoring the<br>graduates listed in the program each<br>graduate will be called to the stage to<br>be congratulated beginning with the<br>award of the degree of doctor of<br>philosophy the vice Chancellor Professor<br>Nick Smith will read the summaries the<br>chancellor will congratulate these<br>graduates<br>so we've just heard from the chancellor<br>about the reason and the value and the<br>excitement and the creativity and the<br>diverse ways in which universities<br>contribute to society and we've heard<br>about the value of humanities in<br>communicating to diverse audiences and<br>valuing the needs of individuals within<br>the needs of communities of<br>contextualizing the opportunities and<br>also the challenges that we have but the<br>advice I would like to start with that<br>we've just heard is to embrace the joy<br>the joy of today to sing and to dance<br>and I can assure you that this is advice<br>that I take very<br>practice for the benefit of both society<br>but the reason I have joy and the reason<br>I dance and sing is when I look out at<br>our graduates in particular I look out<br>at the people who are in the front row<br>the red people who I am now both humbled<br>and honored to be able to introduce they<br>are doctoral graduates who achieve<br>academically at the very highest level<br>and their research is so Central to<br>contributing to those fundamental and<br>increasingly existential questions that<br>we've just been posed it's increasingly<br>difficult in our world as we've heard<br>from John to separate expertise and<br>opinion but I would argue that it is now<br>more important than it's ever been our<br>doctoral graduates have spent years<br>learning that craft they help us<br>understand the past the present and what<br>that might mean for our possible Futures<br>they're independent thinkers and makers<br>who achieve and and engage in all<br>aspects that are important as Global<br>Citizens we are both humbled and proud<br>in this University to know them and we<br>look forward to watching the<br>contributions that they will make the<br>short citations that I will now share<br>give only a glimpse of the impact and<br>innovation of their work but they do<br>however I hope give a sense of the<br>significant issues that the next<br>generation of Scholars professionals and<br>teachers are<br>pursuing with the doctors of philosophy<br>please come<br>forward a umu J<br>San I as work focused on engineering the<br>micr structure of commercial high<br>temperature superconductors her work<br>produced significant materials<br>engineering knowledge that would allow<br>performance

that<br>domestic tribal norms played in the<br>settlement of Saudi Yemen territorial<br>conflict he found that the exercise of<br>honor-based domestic tribal Norms<br>mediated the exercise of international<br>Norms in settings of territorial<br>conflicts and that they facilitated the<br>demarcation and management of the Saudi<br>Yemen international border Chancellor I<br>present Eric Patrick xuno to the degree<br>of doctor of philosophy in international<br>relations<br>Jonathan<br>penelli Jonathan argues that morality is<br>more than its human expression he does<br>this by

Community empowerment or<br>investigative journalism ially involving<br>world please welcome to give The<br>Graduate<br>fellow students fellow Learners teachers<br>academics Faro and friends my name is<br>Aria Gardner and I am deeply honored to<br>be your graduation speaker<br>today education is a right it should not<br>be a<br>privilege as a teenager I loved<br>experiencing life as much as I could I<br>enjoyed being involved meeting people<br>and living life to the fullest and then<br>when I was 15 years old at the beginning<br>of my year 11 I got very sick with a<br>chronic illness called myalgic inphy<br>myelitis and overnight I was no longer<br>able to get out of<br>bed there is a lot of grief in losing<br>the life you thought you would live and<br>as a young teenager those feelings<br>consumed me<br>so fellow graduates I am standing here<br>before you today and I have not<br>completed NCA level one 2 or<br>three I left college at the beginning of<br>my year 11 and I never got well enough<br>to go back to stand here today as a<br>dream come true and my younger self<br>would be very<br>proud education is a right however it<br>can also be a<br>privilege I am extremely fortunate that<br>my body healed and I was able to come to<br>tah aaka via discretionary<br>entrance each and every one of us knows<br>the sacrifices the commitments and the<br>work that went into this degree I<br>encourage you to make the radical<br>decision to embrace every facet of<br>yourself hold this space and give<br>yourself and your education Journey<br>complete grace allow yourself to feel<br>Pride<br>you did<br>this and I wanted today not to just be a<br>commemoration of what we have achieved<br>but also a celebration of what is to<br>come we may have just sat through a few<br>hours of name<br>calling but this room it's filled with<br>energy it's palpable and I wonder do you<br>realize do you realize the infinite<br>possibilities this room represents do<br>you realize that this room houses the<br>Shakers the movers the dancers the<br>flirters the artists the preachers the<br>listeners the teachers you represent<br>infinite<br>possibility and with that possibility we<br>must watch we must pay attention and<br>then we must<br>act education is a right however it is<br>also a privilege I know this because<br>there are no universities left in Gaza<br>they have all been system systemically<br>destroyed and yet through unjust death<br>and destruction Palestinian students<br>live on they are everywhere I see them<br>on my social media I hear their pain and<br>yet they do not stop advocating and<br>fighting for a world that allows their<br>freedom just as much as it allows<br>mine the thing about freedom and hope is<br>they are deeply contagious let them<br>spread fan the Flames use your education<br>to live out your dreams and also help<br>others live<br>theirs I would like to end with a quote<br>that perfectly encapsulates how I'm<br>feeling and what I wish to bestow upon<br>you all it is by the effervescent Audrey<br>Lord once you start to speak people will<br>yell at you they will interrupt you put<br>you down and suggest that it is<br>personal and the world won't end and the<br>speaking will get easier and easier and<br>you will find you have fallen in love<br>with your own Vision with your own voice<br>which you may never have realized you<br>had and you will lose some friends and<br>lovers and realize you don't miss them<br>and new ones will find you and cherish<br>you and you will still flirt paint your<br>nails dress up and party because as I<br>think imma Goldman said if I can't dance<br>I don't want to be a part of your<br>Revolution and at last you'll know with<br>surpassing certainty that only one thing<br>is more frightening than speaking your<br>truth and that is not speaking at<br>all to my beautiful grandparents my wio<br>my incredible Young brother my darling<br>best friends my mom and my dad I would<br>not be here if not for your unwavering<br>care you are all reflections of<br>everything I hope to<br>be thank you in particular at to haing a<br>walker to Jeff tralon and Philip<br>Fountain who taught me how to write a<br>University essay CU I hadn't written one<br>since I was about 14 and who also fueled<br>my passion for religious studies with<br>their glorious<br>teachings thank you to the stud students<br>of Gaza the people of Palestine past<br>present and future you live on in our<br>hearts my degree is for<br>you thank you for<br>listening thank
