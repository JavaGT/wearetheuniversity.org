I am truly very humbled<br>and moved by it<br>in particular in honoring me you honor<br>all public servants and the spirit of<br>service to the community that they bring<br>to their work every day thank you for<br>doing that thank you so<br>much Victoria University is one of the<br>great Ed educational institutions of the<br>world and I'm a I am hugely proud to be<br>a graduate of this University to have<br>worked here as a professor and head of<br>school and now proud to be be receiving<br>this<br>award so let me start with those of you<br>graduating<br>today and I know what that feels like<br>because 43 years ago I was<br>you I was sitting down there I think in<br>the middle somewhere over there with the<br>bachelors's of<br>Arts uh and that was an absolutely great<br>feeling but never in a million years did<br>I ever think I would be back here doing<br>this today probably because I didn't<br>think I'd live to be this<br>old and certainly if I had I would have<br>been much better<br>behaved The Bachelor of Arts can we have<br>raise your hands Bachelors of Arts can<br>Bachelor for each of you just as it was<br>for me today marks the end of a journey<br>and as the chancellor said the beginning<br>of a new one each of you has gotten here<br>through hard work sacrifice commitment<br>persistence uh and a ton of<br>Courage each of you has earned the<br>achievement we are celebrating today you<br>have put yourselves on the line to get<br>here and please know this whatever<br>happens in your life no one can ever<br>take that achievement away from you<br>and so I congratulate each and every one<br>of you on your achievement and I thank<br>you for having the courage to Aspire to<br>it what's important now is what you do<br>with what you've<br>achieved for myself I chose Public<br>Service as my career and I can honestly<br>say that I have not ever not even for<br>one day regretted that<br>choice you will each make your own<br>well so 43 years ago the same year I<br>graduated I signed on to the permanent<br>staff of the department of social<br>welfare I started at the very bottom a<br>basic grade clerk they called us basics<br>for short and that's<br>true it wasn't a great<br>start the assistant director benefits<br>and pensions wrote on my probation<br>report Peter would benefit from learning<br>to curb his natural exuberance<br>matters well I never quite managed that<br>and look where it got<br>me never ever be afraid to question<br>things starting out as a basic grade<br>clerk in the department of social<br>welfare it never occurred to me ever<br>that one day I might end up running the<br>place let alone the entire Public<br>Service<br>itself in Wellington district office the<br>top dog was the district<br>director now I knew who he was because I<br>had to sign his name on correspondence<br>Mr<br>lambi I saw him a handful of times but I<br>don't literally don't ever remember<br>speaking to him and when I got promoted<br>to a junior role in head office the top<br>dog was the director general of social<br>welfare Mr<br>Grant one day I stepped into the lift<br>and he was right there in front of me Mr<br>Grant and I<br>froze and then years later of course I<br>became him when I became head of the<br>department<br>myself again one day I was in the lift<br>when the doors opened and a young woman<br>got in she looked at me and she<br>froze oh she said it's<br>you yes I said it's<br>me I would have thought you would have<br>for me Mr lambi and Mr Grant were<br>incredibly powerful<br>people but during the whole time I've<br>held these sorts of jobs I've never once<br>felt that but I have always felt<br>responsible all of the time every day<br>every week and I felt responsible<br>high every day of the working week<br>public servants right across New Zealand<br>get up leave their families and their<br>homes get on buses trains into cars and<br>work and what they do touches the lives<br>of every single New Zealander our<br>families and our<br>communities and they do that mostly<br>because they care and because they want<br>difference and I have to say I really do<br>believe in that I really do believe<br>believe in the ideal of Public Service I<br>believe in the spirit of service to the<br>community that our Public Service Act<br>talks about I believe that it is a noble<br>thing to choose to serve your country<br>and its<br>citizens and I believe that public<br>service is something we should<br>acknowledge celebrate and<br>reward and it saddens me when that is<br>not the<br>case we need our public sector to be<br>efficient<br>to deliver services that people can rely<br>on to drive the best outcomes and to be<br>future<br>focused but the Beating Heart of all of<br>that and more is the people who choose<br>public service and why they are<br>there I believe that you get the best<br>out of people by appealing to the best<br>in people and in the public sector<br>that's the spirit of service that people<br>bring to their work<br>when we're able to harness that Spirit<br>connect it to the needs of citizens and<br>communities and Empower people to make a<br>difference that's when the magic<br>happens that's when lives are<br>changed the spirit of service that our<br>public servants bring to their work is a<br>tonger in our nation and as the Public<br>Service Act says we ought to preserve<br>it Public Service of course is not<br>confined to the the public service<br>itself our political leaders are public<br>servants our judges are public servants<br>our teachers and School principles are<br>public servants many of you do voluntary<br>work in the community that is public<br>service some of you serve on school<br>boards that is public<br>service and to that work you bring a<br>spirit of service to your<br>communities whatever it is that you<br>choose to do with your life you will<br>have opportunities through Public<br>Service Embrace those opportunities<br>public service will enrich your lives<br>nation we should remember those who got<br>us here each of you graduating today is<br>privileged to have attended this<br>University and to have learned from the<br>academic staff and students here and so<br>to the staff of the University I say<br>thank you so very<br>much back in 1981 I nearly didn't make<br>graduation I decided not to go it was<br>all a bit too establishment you'll<br>remember well you won't remember but<br>this was the<br>80s and establishment was not the place<br>to be<br>that was until my father intervened and<br>he informed me that I was going to<br>graduation and that I was going to go<br>for my mother and for our family and of<br>course he was right because up until<br>that point I'd thought it was all about<br>me not about anybody<br>else whatever our own talents none of us<br>is able to do what we do in our work and<br>in our lives without the love and<br>support of our parents Partners families<br>and friends those who believe in us and<br>those who back us in our lives and so to<br>the parents Partners families and<br>much in my own life I've had that too<br>and so in particular I want to<br>acknowledge my partner Mark and my<br>sister Diane both of you have given me<br>your total unconditional backing and<br>support to do the jobs I've done all the<br>way through every single time thank you<br>so<br>much and so finally back to each of<br>you congratulations once again on your<br>achievement go well live your lives with<br>Spirit heart and passion always strive<br>to make a difference for others and<br>never forget this day and those who<br>helped you get here n taoto taoto taoto<br>c</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
