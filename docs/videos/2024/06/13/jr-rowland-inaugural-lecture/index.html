You’ll meet her three R’s of education, and the C’s that increasingly underpin her leadership practice. She discusses ‘failing up’, the ‘fraud’ feeling, and ‘feeling the fear and carrying on'. This is a talk about people, projects, places, and most of all, the transformative power of academia.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically

pleasure to<br>welcome you to the university and to the<br>inaugural lecture of Jr<br>Roland Jr is a structural geologist with<br>a passion for tectonic magmatic<br>hydrologic interactions to clear and<br>Rift settings I'll leave her to explain<br>what that means this sort of research is<br>relevant to geothermal and mineral<br>exploration to understanding geohazards<br>and to understanding fundamental<br>tectonic processes over the years she's<br>T across structural geology tectonics<br>and field geology and offered higher<br>level courses and all forming Hydro<br>hydrothermal systems earthquake geology<br>and tectonic GE for<br>morphology K's research has of course as<br>a result taken her to some amazing<br>places such as Antarctica Ethiopia Chile<br>and the<br>Caribbean in addition to New Zealand's<br>wonderful natural geoscience<br>laboratory she's had a non-conventional<br>academic career as a New Zealand hockey<br>rep in 1985 she looked forward to<br>pursuing a sporting career that was<br>curtailed by industry Plan B was the<br>secondary preschool teaching something<br>she was good at teaching maths and<br>science before rising to head of<br>physical education at Weston Springs<br>College however she didn't want to<br>remain head of PE forever so retrained<br>here at Oakland As a geologist did a PhD<br>in geology at Oto launched her academic<br>career as a lecturer there before being<br>lured back to ockland rising to lead the<br>school of environment before becoming<br>acting Deputy Dean then Deputy dean of<br>science she's got a glutton for<br>punishment with a particular focus on<br>Staffing and strategy she's also been an<br>inaugural inaugural director of NAA fetu<br>the center for climate device<br>biodiversity and<br>Society tonight Jr is going to try to<br>convince us that an academic career is<br>one of high adventure J the floor is<br>yours<br>um John for your very very kind words uh<br>and I think you've actually stolen the<br>show so I can go home now because you<br>told the whole story and I don't know<br>why I'm here um no I'm going to add<br>flavor and uh and a little bit of<br>flourish to uh uh the story that you've<br>told so far on my behalf um and uh I<br>want to start with with a really warm<br>welcome to uh everyone who's come here<br>tonight I know I've Got Friends uh<br>really good friends and family here um<br>I've got uh people who have come from<br>the professional um staff here tonight<br>and I really thank you for coming and my<br>colleagues as well and and a few few<br>Strays or retiree in here somewhere I<br>think it was quite important at some<br>stage in my career thank you all so very<br>much for coming along and making this<br>room uh warm tonight and I guess I want<br>to put it like this this picture uh I<br>was lucky enough to take with Jude my<br>partner when we were tramping recently<br>and you're looking out towards ouri<br>Mount Cook and that is a land uplifted<br>High according to Abel tasmin and he was<br>right and it's uplifted by a kazillion<br>earthquakes um that have actually done<br>that job and just in case you were<br>wondering 75% chance in the next 50<br>years and this is why Jude I get a bit<br>nervous when we go tramping in the Hills<br>um but but just like the mountain needs<br>so many Earth Quakes to rise I think um<br>my ascending to these lofty Heights of<br>Professor is not on my own work alone so<br>I just want to have a big shout out<br>right at the start in case I get all all<br>stressed trying to race through my<br>slides to the end I want to have a shout<br>out to my sponsors collaborators and<br>partners in crime I know I've got<br>partners in crime here Caroline you are<br>a very big partner in crime but I've got<br>others I've got Faro here who are<br>partners in crime in the field suir<br>wherever you you are you were a partner<br>in crime and and I have to say that the<br>entire level six and particularly you<br>Cassandra are a partner in crime um we<br>and what I mean by that is is we have<br>have a heck of a lot of fun doing really<br>interesting things that hopefully have<br>some benefit um my sponsors of course<br>I'll touch on on those people as we move<br>through the talk I really want to<br>acknowledge professional and academic<br>people here today U my students I got<br>have got a few current student and um<br>students that have completed here<br>tonight<br>um the living and the Dead uh my dad is<br>one of those uh the latter of that um to<br>all the movers and shakers who've lifted<br>me to the gidon heights of Professor I<br>really want to thank you very much and<br>um and putting it at the front I really<br>want to start with this list of<br>postgraduate research students now um<br>it's impossible to list all of the<br>students because if you look at co-<br>supervisions the list just gets really<br>big um for the master students but I've<br>listed here the doctoral students that<br>um I have been involved with through to<br>the completion of their their projects<br>and also in blue too who are hoping to<br>complete and master students that I have<br>been primary supervisor on and for me<br>this presents a a an enormous<br>contribution that I'm really proud of<br>because I'm really proud of these people<br>and um the person I've got the<br>photograph of here um the guy in the red<br>overalls here that's Gustav NAA he was<br>my first student where I planned a<br>project for him and I supervised him<br>from start to finish as a master's<br>student and um he then went on to work<br>with a very great mate of mine in<br>Australia Nick Oliver and he's gone on<br>Gustav's gone on to uh attain really<br>highly in uh the minerals sector uh in<br>the United States and I'm I'm so proud<br>of him and I'm really proud of all of<br>the other people in here I see Jeff<br>you're here today proud of you proud of<br>you Erton amazing people who have um<br>have done a great work and someone who's<br>actually a Lector here James mad I think<br>you're on that list I think we kicked<br>off some fun in Antarctica so thank you<br>very<br>much let's go back to the beginning um<br>and this is where I came from Wong Ani<br>down here on the West Coast and this is<br>where I was um I I grew up um I only<br>just made it to hospital 20 minutes from<br>go to to wo there um otherwise I'd have<br>been born in this house I was racing<br>from the start and I and um this is<br>still where my mom lives and a couple of<br>years ago if you had visit visited you'd<br>have opened the back door and there<br>would be an and Helen um saying hello<br>and I know that both my mom obviously<br>really proud of me and so was my dad he<br>would have been delighted to have seen<br>this today um I guess I just want to<br>mention a little bit about the family<br>history in that dad was a Sparky or an<br>electrician for uh the railroads and<br>then was made redundant there and then<br>uh picked up a Sparky job at the post<br>office workshops and ended up being made<br>redundant from that and the reason for<br>the redundancies was the politics of the<br>day it was<br>centralization and that gave me a very<br>very strong Um passion for politics I I<br>almost trained in politics but um these<br>two my mom and dad were absolutely<br>adamant that what we ought to do with<br>study science so all the way through uh<br>High School I um studied the three<br>sciences and a few other subjects<br>because they felt that that was how I<br>would get a career that could uh keep me<br>afloat financially<br>um my mom grew up on a farm and um she's<br>really the genius in the family so if if<br>I can ever uh think as clearly and<br>critically as she does I I'll be very<br>very happy I've also put up on here this<br>little Dy oh my God this was such a pain<br>for me through most of my life I've only<br>just got rid of it and I'm not entirely<br>convinced I have this is a is a a little<br>poem that my grandmother had and it was<br>good better best never let it rest still<br>your good is better and you better best<br>it's really catchy and it gets stuck in<br>your brain and and you become this<br>person that is absolutely driven to do<br>that it's taken me uh 50 years almost 60<br>50 years to realize that good enough is<br>good enough but I put it<br>there because because it was sort of<br>pretty important in the fabric of who I<br>am and it possibly still is I don't want<br>to talk about it too<br>much anyway they um were very determined<br>that we have a good education<br>um but we didn't have a lot of money<br>around however one of the great things<br>was that Dad when he was working for the<br>post office in the railways had access<br>to these little holiday Cottages that<br>you could bid for and go into a ballot<br>and so uh once in a while over the<br>holidays Christmas holidays we might<br>have won a place in the ballot and so we<br>got to see some of the country in the<br>Central north isand and um this is a<br>picture of the family A dad's in a rare<br>moment dad is taking the photograph of<br>my sister Karen and my brother Mark Mark<br>was the real science geek they they both<br>ended up being pharmacists um I wasn't<br>going to be a pharmacist but here we are<br>at w mangu in<br>1974 and Karen is wearing a patch on her<br>knee because there are no guard rails<br>and we've already been to the mud pools<br>at w tapoo and so um you know we always<br>got injured when we went there it was<br>with mixed feelings cuz we were<br>inquisitive and then we'd get a bit<br>close and that that's me there um um<br>looking really motivated<br>enthusiastic the thing is what I didn't<br>know was that just almost 40 years later<br>I would write with Stuart Simmons a<br>really great sponsor of me and a<br>colleague of me I would write this paper<br>that really summarized a lot of my work<br>up to this state in economic geology and<br>this picture has made it to the cover of<br>economic geology it's in that paper and<br>of course it's of the wongu geothermal<br>field and that paper was a holistic<br>overarching review of the of things I'm<br>interested in which is hydrologic<br>magmatic and tectonic controls on<br>hydrothermal flow now the interesting<br>thing about that paper is it actually<br>won an award this really progressed my<br>career with the Society of economic<br>geology and that Society based out of<br>the United States has been really<br>instrumental in a lot of my<br>International opportunities that I've<br>had it won the best paper published in a<br>single year of that journal um in 2012<br>and I was super excited about that it<br>got the Skinner award now the<br>interesting thing is when I got that<br>award I thought to myself here's a<br>chance because there's a certain award<br>that the geoscience Society of New<br>Zealand used to run for best paper<br>published in the preceding three years<br>and that's called the maai hammer and I<br>thought to myself I might have a chance<br>so got my mates together Kathy you were<br>one of them up at the back and um I got<br>sponsored I got people to put in a<br>nomination for the Makai Hammer<br>geoscience Society didn't get it still<br>eligible a Kathy could you put that<br>sponsorship form in again did it again<br>didn't get it Third Time Lucky the last<br>chance I got it the maai hammer and the<br>value of sponsorship but it was also<br>determination because do you know in the<br>50-year history of that award how many<br>hammer I was the first broke broke the<br>broke the glass<br>ceiling and and I looked into it when I<br>did the reception speech there at the<br>geoscience society because I looked into<br>it and I thought how can that be<br>possible there are so many Fantastic<br>women Geo geoscientists out there and we<br>weren't proom we weren't nominating<br>ourselves we we did not have a<br>sponsorship mentality<br>and so I just recommend that have a<br>sponsorship mentality now back to the<br>story okay when I was growing up I had<br>high literature underpinning me and I<br>absolutely coveted reading my brother's<br>world of Wonder magazines in search of<br>the pole and I absolutely spent hours<br>pouring over my father's copy of high<br>adventure by Edmund Hillary I was really<br>interested in stories of heroic Endeavor<br>and bravery<br>um to balance that out my grandma lived<br>on a farm that that occupied for a whole<br>bunch of decades and there were lots and<br>lots of bookshelves of 1920s books that<br>I devoured like these ones now there<br>might be some people in them no Angela<br>Brazil the youngest girl in the 5ifth<br>written in the 1920s and she also wrote<br>bosom friends I have no idea if that had<br>any impact but but there it is and I was<br>also absolutely motivated by the SK<br>Trevor Manning<br>1976 he was the hockey goalkeeper for<br>the winning Olympic team in that year<br>and you know what he got hit by a hockey<br>ball on the kneecap in the final 15<br>minutes or so of that match it's smashed<br>his kneecap and he played<br>on I was so impressed I thought I I<br>watched that I remember watching it and<br>I thought at that moment I thought I<br>want to play for New Zealand I made that<br>decision when I was in um I can't<br>remember what it was 1976 I made that<br>decision then I want to play hockey for<br>New Zealand it had everything going for<br>it heroic Behavior the risk of injury<br>and and of course no real padding um<br>which I'll I'll mention in a minute so<br>here I am I'm<br>um well I don't know what you mean um<br>and I am a very stylish girl which is<br>why I'm wearing this outfit today um<br>this is me at 15 going to mufty day in<br>Wong<br>Ani I didn't have a clue um but that<br>suit I had purchased from the Opti shop<br>in Martin with my grandma for $2 and my<br>mom was a marvelous um tailor and she<br>recut it uh to fit me I it wouldn't fit<br>me today and she made me that lovely<br>shirt and I'm looking styly because I<br>wearing really cool sneakers there so so<br>there I am the world's my oyster I'm<br>going to play hockey for New Zealand<br>what do I need to do to get there I<br>thought to myself I quite like science I<br>know maybe I'll go and do a PE degree go<br>to FID school down in otaro so I applied<br>for that now I was playing a lot of<br>hockey and um wasn't so interested in my<br>studies but somehow or other by the end<br>of the seventh form I got accepted for<br>phid school so I was really excited off<br>to atago<br>unfortunately I'd also applied for the<br>teachers training College stip in to go<br>to Teachers College that would have<br>allowed me to take up the FID School uh<br>opportunity we needed the money to get<br>to get me off to University and all of a<br>sudden that didn't happen they had too<br>many phid teachers they got this little<br>letter saying<br>no well I didn't have a plan B because I<br>have a plan a um so I looked at my mom<br>she looked at me I pretty much flunk my<br>bser exams just scraped in a pass but<br>you know CES get degrees and um anyway<br>mom said right to the Ministry of<br>Education so I did dear Ministry of<br>Education I'll do anything and and they<br>came back to me and they gave me a<br>stipend which allowed me to survive and<br>they said you're going to ockland and<br>you're going to do division B which is<br>three years at Teachers College in Epsom<br>um which really amounted to a quar a<br>third of my time there then a third of<br>your time at University getting by the<br>end of your teachers college diploma<br>two-thirds of a degree and the rest of<br>the time is on the bus in<br>between that big smoke if you do physic<br>pH and maths oh okay so I came up here<br>to do physics and maths at teachers<br>college did phet as a second teaching<br>subject never let yourself get held back<br>ended up being that head of Department<br>teaching physical education but it put<br>me on the Oakland trajectory and it<br>really gave me a good sense of of<br>resilience at the start you know things<br>don't always go right but I did play<br>hockey and this is me Vice Captain the<br>New Zealand under 21s then I got into<br>the full New Zealand team now I'll just<br>point out not Bridget inder's bottom<br>here but if you if you look closely this<br>is the practice for a competition<br>International competition you can see<br>there's a slight shadowing on my uh<br>tummy there and perhaps you can make up<br>out a pad here this is me getting really<br>excited about Material Science because<br>prior to that little contraption that<br>I'm wearing which is Sheila strap number<br>two um we didn't have any padding in<br>those days so it was a bit I mean<br>getting the helmet was pretty exciting<br>um no padding that my mother made and<br>she made it for me as the second version<br>close cell foam uh padding across my<br>thighs in my tummy got me really<br>interested in that sort of stuff but I<br>have to tell you the first version was a<br>failure the first version was close cell<br>up holstery foam in a sort of a slip<br>that she had made in underpants for<br>sanitary napkins um and and they were<br>quite tight fitting uh pants and<br>unfortunately I had quite tight fitting<br>tracksuit pants so there were complaints<br>about the gender identity of the people<br>on the hockey team so I had to tell her<br>to change but anyway um I had 10<br>absolutely wonderful years teaching<br>teenagers at a range of schools in<br>central Oakland and this is one of the<br>few photographs I've got left that I<br>could find of me with some absolutely<br>brilliant kids out at tangaro College in<br>Ulta and I started my teaching career at<br>James coook high I had a very short<br>stint at St cit's College where I came<br>away knowing that um they do a fantastic<br>job with kids but they really didn't<br>want me um and I was about to lose my<br>job because I was a deviant and um I<br>very quickly realized I have so many<br>stories from St cbet it's changed but<br>but this was just after the homosexual<br>law reform and you'd think that have got<br>it right but they didn't so they were<br>basically sacking anyone who was of my<br>persuasion and um I just my contract<br>wouldn't have been renewed so I went<br>back to tangor college had a fantastic<br>time there then got promoted up to being<br>a head of pH at Western Springs college<br>and it was great I met brilliant<br>brilliant Educators and I really leared<br>my craft in the secondary schools I<br>worked in and I learned something about<br>teaching in terms of my philosophy of<br>teaching and I'm going to come back to<br>that later on I just want to mention<br>these brilliant Educators though Jim<br>Peters is not the Jim Peters we know Jim<br>Peters was an absolute genius uh as a<br>leader uh in education was head of um<br>sedan high school and then Western<br>Spence College just brilliant and all of<br>these other people through here<br>fantastic um so from I got to about 10<br>10 years in teaching and I really felt<br>that um I couldn't continue to open the<br>gym door so enthusiastically in the<br>morning and it was partly because the<br>music that I was having to play wasn't<br>really my genre of music anymore and it<br>was partly because I was getting injured<br>and really wanted to do something with<br>my brain and I didn't want to become a<br>um Deputy head of a of a high school<br>having to administer punishment to<br>students so I decided I needed to go<br>back and finish my degree and the most<br>marvelous thing was that Ministry of<br>Education gave out scholarships where I<br>could maintain my teachers College<br>salary at my teaching salary go back to<br>UNI and finish my degree and I came back<br>here and I finished it in geology and I<br>was so utterly utterly hooked I had to<br>come back and do a BSC with Bernard and<br>I'm sorry where are you Bernard<br>somewhere in here I can't see you where<br>are<br>you somewhere somewhere here hiding away<br>I there you are um so this is a picture<br>of a younger Bernard in the um Golden<br>Cross un uh workings in the coramandel<br>goldfields and that photo is by my other<br>colleague Stuart Simmons and look at the<br>Wonder on Bernard's face as he's looking<br>up at these veins that are containing<br>gold uh in the coramandel<br>Bernard taught me<br>geometry and he taught me to absolutely<br>be enthralled by the landscape and to<br>read the form and the architecture of<br>the landscape uh when you look at it and<br>I'm very very grateful to you for that<br>Bernard you gave me a passion for<br>reading the landscape now I'm going to<br>show you what I mean by that here is be<br>a little bit of science here is a<br>wonderful example from archers from<br>Canyonlands National Park showing you<br>these beautiful horizontal strata this<br>uh original surface if you like the<br>bedding<br>surface if you can recognize that you<br>can go somewhere else like this which is<br>in the looking from the French to the<br>Spanish Pyrenees and you can start to<br>look for the strata and you can see some<br>through here beautiful layers that have<br>been turned on their side you can track<br>them into the Hills behind striking up<br>into the distance and for those of you<br>who' have got really a good Mouse for<br>this and should have done geology over<br>here you might see them coming and<br>folding the other way so you can kind of<br>draw a fold on the landscape you can<br>start to interpret it I was in thralled<br>by this now if you can't see it at the<br>big scale it's all covered up sometimes<br>you can find little small examples that<br>will help you out so you can see in the<br>field things like this this is fold<br>convergence and the cool thing about<br>this is that the little folds mimic the<br>big folds so if you can see the way the<br>little fold is verging even if you can't<br>see the big fold you know it's there<br>unless it's been eroded away so that's<br>one thing virgin and another example<br>just to give you stage two structural<br>geology when these uh layers of land get<br>squeezed and compressed you can get<br>another fabric developing in that rock<br>and it's because as you squeeze it all<br>the little clay minerals which are sort<br>of platey all those clay minerals line<br>up like this into a plane of flattening<br>and it creates a particular type of<br>fabric and just incidentally that's<br>called<br>cleavage now here's an example okay so<br>here we're looking at an example of the<br>bedding that es snort surface through<br>there and the cleavage cutting across it<br>okay so you've got the bedding and the<br>cleavage and here's how you know where<br>the fold is you put your hand on the<br>cleavage and you pack the bed and you<br>know which way to go to get to the fold<br>I had a lot of trouble teaching<br>structural geology you you you wait till<br>you start talking about um the problem<br>that you have with homogeneous and<br>heterogeneous strain and that straight<br>lines stay straight under a homogeneous<br>strain and yet they become bent under<br>well after having a great time doing my<br>honors um with uh Bernard I was really<br>hooked and I wanted to do a PhD and um I<br>needed it to be financed with a<br>scholarship and Bernard said why don't<br>you write to Professor Simpson in Oto<br>and I completely misheard Bernard With<br>His Marvelous Swiss German accent and I<br>said Dear Professor<br>Simpson Rick Simpson would have been I<br>would at the time I would say would have<br>been um one of the global experts in<br>structural geology and his um his main<br>area of Interest was the interaction<br>between faults or cracks in the earth<br>and fluids moving through it I was<br>incredibly lucky that he took me on and<br>a piece of advice he gave me was that if<br>you want to study something you could be<br>working on a piece of Kit and you locked<br>to that piece of Kit forever or you<br>could work on a place but then you're<br>stuck in that place if you work on<br>processes they'll take you anywhere so<br>he then set me off on the Central North<br>Island this area in red here a<br>volcanically and hydrothermally active<br>environment um that is splitting apart<br>at about the rate your fingernail grows<br>and he said go away and figure out how<br>faults and fluids interact in this place<br>and here's a photograph looking down<br>into the central part of that area at a<br>at a um block of land uplifted on one<br>side the pyal block and a beautiful<br>fault running down down the axis of that<br>of that piece of land and of course he<br>went off in sabatical and left me to it<br>for 6 months so it was it it was a very<br>interesting experience but the three<br>processes I just want to touch on so you<br>know a little bit about the science I do<br>the first process is how does water rain<br>water that lands on the surface of the<br>Earth how does it actually percolate<br>down through the Rock and come back up<br>to the surface to form a beautiful hot<br>pool like this and the thing about water<br>flowing through the rock is that as you<br>go deeper or if the rock is more like a<br>lava as opposed to a pile of sand you<br>need cracks for that water to get<br>through the rock so that's the<br>structural geology component of the<br>story and I got very interested in U<br>cracks like this because they're very<br>important down here the water goes in<br>gets heated up by some sort of heat<br>Source comes up to the surface ends up<br>in a hot spring what's the plumbing<br>system like<br>if you look at old cold systems that<br>have been eroded well they look a bit<br>like this they look like these gold and<br>silver quartz veins that we get in the<br>coramandel so I was intrigued the second<br>process underneath what's the heat<br>that's driving this hydrothermal system<br>and that is the deepest seated molten<br>rock the magmatic system if it gets<br>through to the surface like I'm showing<br>you here you might get a volcanic<br>eruption like this one in 1995 96 puu<br>however it generally stalls in the mid<br>crust and that's the heat source for the<br>plumbing system now magma moving through<br>the crust likes to move in cracks it<br>likes to move as long sheets of lava<br>called as you know dkes so I wanted to<br>go to and see as many different dyes as<br>I could and um this is me sitting on I<br>think James we named this one talula and<br>Allen Hill's Antarctica and James mu<br>heard I recall you were up on the back<br>of that dke really quickly to get your<br>photograph taken as well so I went and<br>had to look everywhere I could to try<br>and look at this geology and it was<br>amazing and James I just want to point<br>out had a fabulous paper out of the work<br>he did down here now I just want to show<br>you the third process which is those<br>mechanisms that cause the crust to Rift<br>apart and break and um these are what we<br>might call rifting mechanisms so I'm<br>showing you an examp example of un rft<br>crust here and then if you let that just<br>collapse those blocks of land if you<br>like which are represented by the books<br>they rotate over and slide past one<br>another and that's the normal faulting<br>but if you stick magma in the mix it can<br>take up the space without you having<br>this sort of rollover falting effect and<br>that that influences what you see at the<br>surface so this is what I mean so um if<br>if if you put the this is stage three<br>lecture notes by the way so if you put<br>the magma up the middle then you can<br>stretch without um causing all that<br>falting but you will get falting above<br>it if there's any Rock mess above here<br>so those are the three processes I was<br>interested in they absolutely shaped uh<br>my uh career and I guess in a way um you<br>could was the other title but I couldn't<br>use it was really diyes and hot cracks<br>really is um I I I'm being perfectly<br>straight here because that actually is<br>what I study um so maybe it was meant to<br>be well I went to Ethiopia because<br>Ethiopia I was invited to go there Cindy<br>met me through uh Rick encouraging me to<br>go off to the UK and visit her and Cindy<br>was running huge lithospheric scale<br>experiments um in Ethiopia I don't know<br>why she invited me she had no reason to<br>invite me along to one of her field<br>Seasons it was just absolute sponsorship<br>in the purest form and um that led to<br>about seven or eight years of me going<br>backwards and forwards to Ethiopia and<br>and there there's so many people I I'm<br>only picking two people out here that<br>were particularly pivotal to me tesi<br>kadani who is just was working at at<br>asaba<br>University uh in Ethiopia who I worked<br>with very closely and Derek K who had<br>been a postto for Cindy but then worked<br>on his own right and we just had a lot<br>of adventures in the field this is from<br>one field campaign um unfortunately<br>tessi had to go back to the university<br>and his technician waly who's here with<br>the hammer um was basically our uh our<br>support person to the field trip um and<br>unfortunately he didn't have quite the<br>manner of test five so we did get into a<br>bit of a pickle on that trip because<br>they're very hierarchical there and we<br>ended up being um oh well detained um<br>for a day and uh it we went from place<br>to place until we finally ended up being<br>detained behind a hotel on a veranda in<br>the dark with a whole bunch of fellows<br>chatting about whether to put us in jail<br>or release us and finally one opened up<br>a a a lever operated cell phone and<br>called I think apparently the Sultan of<br>AFA who said let them go so off we went<br>um I also had a hand in marriage offered<br>offered to me on this particular<br>occasion but it was only third uh third<br>accept um anyway the other places we<br>went to um we I had this incredible<br>event happened give me on the time<br>happened in Ethiopia in 2005 and um this<br>is the Red Sea here and uh the Gulf of<br>Aiden and here's afar which is the very<br>thinned part of Ethiopia and up in this<br>region here it split apart across a line<br>length of about 60 km and I'm just<br>showing you that on this relief map not<br>cuz I'm going to talk talk about it in<br>detail um but just to put a map there um<br>and that I was lucky enough to get<br>invited to the urgency response for that<br>and I went out in 2006 and we saw<br>amazing damage like this offset this is<br>dy Juiced faulting happening at the<br>surface um and uh what we did there was<br>we put out a whole pile of geophysical<br>arrays to record what was going on and<br>and this event continued on for another<br>5 years well um a big con Consortium of<br>funders big science in the UK got<br>involved and I was lucky enough to get<br>mden funding uh from the Royal Society<br>to parallel that and I was able to go<br>back and do work in this environment um<br>and I did for a few years uh this is<br>test five on up here on this side the<br>Eastern side of the rift on the last<br>trip I went there in 2009 he and I and<br>his student here uh amaha were had had a<br>plan as it happened um we were going to<br>start off with tesi achieving his<br>objectives on this side of the rift and<br>then we were going to drive around and<br>come in here and I was going to do my<br>objectives which were on this side of<br>the rift and I was really determined<br>that testy got to do his stuff first<br>because this project was so big and all<br>of the lead scientists were from the UK<br>and it wasn't a situation where the<br>Ethiopian scientists got to do their<br>stuff first so tesi absolutely did his<br>stuff first and it was so lucky because<br>um we had a pretty big party um and it<br>grew because it was really just supposed<br>to be testy his student me and a driver<br>and a couple of um maybe one or two uh<br>guards but the Consortium everyone<br>wanted to come with me so we ended up<br>with this big big group and that meant a<br>lot of vehicles and it turns out that<br>this one supposedly four-wheel drive<br>actually was only two wheel drive so we<br>had a lot of trouble with it which meant<br>we were traveling after dark right at<br>the wrong time now I mentioned the size<br>of the party because um there had been<br>situations of bandits in the area and um<br>unfortunately on this particular trip<br>our news in terms of safety was coming<br>slowly slower than the developments on<br>the ground and as it turned out um we<br>arrived at this encampment here with<br>these wonderful people in the dark and<br>they were very reluctant to have us Camp<br>there we needed to Camp very reluctant<br>it turns out that what it happened was<br>that Bandits had been through the area<br>before a night before were still in the<br>area and they were extremely worried<br>because they were not armed but they let<br>us stay there well the next day we went<br>uh we had to go and speak to the chief<br>before we were allowed to come out and<br>uh we actually took back um some<br>distance uh to the constabulary um one<br>of the bandits who' given themselves up<br>um we also took this little goat back<br>because one of my uh guards wanted to<br>take it to his mom for dinner um and<br>you'll notice this rifle has got the<br>magazine in it whenever we traveled I<br>always had a rule no magazines in the<br>rifle none at all this particular day he<br>looked at me he raised his eyebrows I<br>said yes do load that gun now I think I<br>did have a bit of um stress coming back<br>after that and I just want to note that<br>because um my partner of the first 15<br>years of my uh time Academia it was<br>Jenny and she was um incredibly<br>supportive of me through those early<br>days and saw me change my career and<br>everything her in the chilot family were<br>amazing but you know that sort of<br>business takes its toll on relationships<br>and so I'm one of those geoscientists<br>whose relationships really didn't<br>survive and I think partly because of<br>some of those field excursions too hard<br>on me and too hard on her but we did get<br>some papers out of it I'm not going to<br>spend time on those cuz time's flashing<br>by we got a couple of really good papers<br>out of it<br>and I was able to come back and apply<br>what I'd learned there to the New<br>Zealand context however there was<br>something I felt distinctly<br>uncomfortable about it about that big<br>science trip and um it is was missing a<br>whole pile of connection and<br>collaboration that we would do in New<br>Zealand that was not done there no one<br>asked the locals what they thought and<br>knew of the envir enironment they were<br>living in they uh were not they were<br>really just people to be hired to<br>protect your gear so um that really<br>shaped some of my thinking coming away<br>from that particular trip anyway I did<br>get a paper out coming back with Colin<br>Wilson one of my great collaborators<br>where we applied what I'd learned in<br>Ethiopia to our New Zealand context I'm<br>only showing you this to show that you<br>can publish bang boom and Kaboom it is<br>possible well I got a job I got a job in<br>2002 coming here as a lecturer and in<br>those days there actually still was a<br>bander machine in the office there was<br>an overhead projector there were chalk<br>boards we used uh I was very excited cuz<br>I had two carousels with two slide<br>projectors and a lot of work at the<br>board now this is the list of courses I<br>had to teach within two weeks of<br>arriving at the<br>University and um I had 2/3 of this one<br>I had a third of 205<br>I had H maybe a half of of 305 I had to<br>help out on the field geology course and<br>I had 712 all on my own and I really<br>didn't have anything to uh go with so I<br>had to create everything and I guess<br>that meant that when I came for<br>continuation 3 years later gee I was<br>lucky I was lucky wasn't I Kathy they<br>did not want to continue me and they<br>said to me in the continuation interview<br>teaching oh I said because the head of<br>school said I had to why didn't you say<br>no there's a thought so after that I<br>started reducing my teaching and that<br>was really great um but the teaching was<br>a wonderful Adventure in and of itself I<br>absolutely adore teaching and I got to<br>go to great places like this one delphy<br>Greece the center of the world on<br>research and study leave um great places<br>for structural geology because they have<br>things like this this gorgeous dely<br>fault and sushir you will be looking at<br>that white stripe at the bottom because<br>you were with me and Debby on that<br>occasion and I was going oh look look<br>you can see the most recent movement of<br>the fault it's paler than the rest of<br>paint and you were<br>right and anyway I love teaching I<br>absolutely adore it and um in the time<br>I've been teaching the technology has<br>changed so much for me it was really<br>exciting when we got cisil online and<br>then we got canvas and I could do things<br>I could create whole courses in this<br>environment that made sense and that<br>would lead students through what they<br>were doing I realized partway through<br>and this as well before Co that if I<br>could take out some of the um work where<br>I was having to show students time and<br>time and time again how to do something<br>and put it on videos um that that would<br>help their learning and and CLA where<br>are you oh my god CLA from across the<br>road would come over to the house at<br>night and I'd have a bottle of wine and<br>a few beers and we'd start making these<br>videos now they are all on YouTube you<br>can look them up and in some of them I<br>do look a bit rough um one of them in<br>particular has got<br>44,000<br>views and when I went to Indonesia to<br>teach a short course um a student stood<br>up and said I I know you and it was from<br>these videos I've tried everything I've<br>tried props I've tried interpretive<br>dance I've done role plays um and all<br>sorts of things and what I love about<br>the way teaching is going is the<br>opportunity with learning analytics to<br>really improve that relational<br>engagement just going to jump that one<br>and just cross on to my three hours in<br>teaching um it's really simple and it's<br>always been the case for me that these<br>this is my teaching philosophy and it's<br>been my philosophy since I started<br>teaching Secondary School<br>and I think teaching is relational<br>reciprocal and relevant and if you get<br>those things right you can't go wrong<br>and relational teaching means you need<br>to<br>know and and um respect the person who<br>is in front of you and that means<br>knowing their names and it means knowing<br>and respecting where they're coming from<br>and that they might have a different<br>mindset and worldview to you um the<br>reciprocal part is the fact that when<br>you're engaging you're learning as much<br>as they learning and that actually adds<br>a lot of value to to the experience and<br>I noticed when I stopped doing so much<br>teaching my um my thinking my scientific<br>thinking was actually dropping back a<br>bit and it's got to be relevant now um<br>one of the things that we've I I did<br>with the students and I was really<br>chuffed with it I'm not going to show<br>you this but I did a lovely video<br>exercise where students went off again<br>before covid and um created YouTube<br>videos this one here was standout um you<br>can look up but but these students<br>really um engaged with just having<br>different forms of assessment that let<br>them really think about their learning<br>and I'm a big fan of this I want to put<br>a shout out to University of Oakland's<br>teach well framework if you haven't got<br>into it in your a lecture get into it<br>it's great um so a quick academic career<br>trajectory without going through in a<br>lot of detail um from 2001 through<br>through to<br>2023 this is my sort of typ iCal<br>research trajectory for me the blue are<br>the numbers of papers I got out not many<br>in the first but gee why was that um and<br>then I started to pick up and through<br>here in the mid years maybe seven in a<br>year or so on and then oh gosh those<br>those outputs have dropped back again<br>but look at what's picked up this is my<br>service point2<br>FTE I'd taken on head of Earth Sciences<br>then took on head environment 6 then<br>oops ended up somehow or other an AAL<br>director ofu along with some wonderful<br>colleagues so that absolutely had an<br>impact but so did some other things I<br>did the women in leadership program and<br>then I decided I was getting overlooked<br>for leadership opportunities and I used<br>some of a little slush fund a jamt I had<br>to go on an outstanding course called a<br>leadership mindset course run out of the<br>business school and that absolutely<br>moved me into a new Direction um this<br>wasn't all plain sailing there were um<br>real um walls that I hit along the way<br>with research funding with um perhaps<br>staff acting as blocks to where I might<br>go and um I would say the greatest thing<br>that I had along this was some really<br>great colleagues and mates that I could<br>chat to I mean here's my promotions but<br>what I haven't I ran out of time I<br>haven't shown you ones I didn't get<br>there were a couple I applied for and<br>didn't get but I had wonderful people in<br>um geology department and then the<br>school of environment who uh really just<br>helped me through this trajectory to<br>where I am today and in particular I<br>want to give a really big shout out to<br>the school of environment so I got to be<br>the head of the school of environment<br>and only for two and a half years before<br>Robin por soul I I cajoled him into<br>being acting head while I went acting<br>Deputy<br>ding I am enormously proud of this<br>school we did a lot of um I think quite<br>pivotal change in the 2 and a half years<br>that I was involved in the school and I<br>know David haard and Michael groomer<br>here today and I just want to thank you<br>guys publicly because we were um we<br>really were three partners in crime and<br>really thinking about how we could<br>reimagine and how we operated the school<br>and some of the things we did we opened<br>the books and made the money absolutely<br>transparent we um let the Committees uh<br>figure out how to spend the budget so<br>that they were energized and we know<br>that worked because the first year we<br>did it um people were a bit slow to ask<br>for money the next year I said oh I<br>wouldn't mind $55,000 no Jr no we<br>haven't no no you're not doing that we<br>haven't got money for that they had it<br>all spent but it meant that the<br>Committees were much more invigorated<br>and we did challenging work um when I<br>entered into this job I didn't expect to<br>get the job as John knows and I but I<br>did create for myself a 5-year plan and<br>I 2 and 1/2 years into that plan and you<br>know what the 2 and 1/2 year mark is<br>when you're doing leadership change it's<br>a fire it's lighting a little bit of a<br>fire to get a change that you want when<br>you might not know the outcome but you<br>know A change is needed and it's uh it's<br>just that little bit of extra impetus to<br>move the team forward but you need to be<br>able to turn down the heat unfortunately<br>I came out as Robin will attest just as<br>the heat was really rocking um but I'm<br>really delighted Robin and I want to pay<br>Testament to you here with the work<br>you've done to really carry that school<br>through and and now in your own right as<br>as head of that school but I'm very<br>proud of what these people have achieved<br>so thank you anyone from the school of<br>environment you're brilliant and thank<br>you for actually getting on board um<br>with some of the things including um<br>this rather interesting thing I got<br>people to<br>do when I first started I really felt<br>like a fraud I was really worried about<br>how it was going to go I was really<br>worried about the first Retreat I had<br>and I thought oh my God you know we we<br>need to talk to each other we need to<br>figure out how to get across the silos<br>we've got in the school we need to<br>understand what each other does so I<br>went to the executive and I and I said<br>to all of the heads of disciplines I<br>said we're going to do Peta cucha we're<br>going to have 20 slides 20 seconds per<br>slide autot transition on each major and<br>it needs to be slick and by the way you<br>have to have at least one joke and a<br>picture of a<br>dog oh the push back and I said doesn't<br>have to for you wow what we got was an<br>hour and a half of laughter I mean I've<br>never heard anything like it we're in<br>Federation um uh University uh of woman<br>University women's room and it just<br>people were laughing for for one and a<br>half hours and one of my colleagues came<br>up afterwards and he said that's why I'm<br>an academic so I can see this sort of<br>clever hilarious stuff and people<br>honestly they were amazing and here are<br>all the dogs that I got in there I think<br>that's your old dog Robin um I don't<br>know whose dog that<br>is I don't think it's<br>newed um and over that time I did manage<br>although I wasn't able to do quite as<br>much research as I wanted myself but I<br>did manage to get out a monograph that<br>I'm really proud of with Dave Reese who<br>I met through the economic geology<br>society and this is on uh it's really a<br>textbook for people who may not<br>necessarily have all of the inside<br>knowledge but it's to help them to get<br>into applying structural geology and<br>mineral deposits and I was really happy<br>to be able to dedicate that to Rick<br>sibson now I just I know I've got a<br>couple of minutes left so I just want to<br>touch on two other uh great cohorts that<br>I've had to work with and um and<br>Leadership work I've been able to do now<br>I put on here for the faculty of<br>science my teams page because I love<br>but I really think it's amazing and um I<br>was able to um with the help of<br>organizational development and<br>particularly Retta I was able to ask hey<br>can we get the can we do something in<br>the faculty that helps us lead better<br>and communicate better with digital<br>literacy and I got a great big yes and<br>an enormous amount of support put into<br>the faculty of science to lift the<br>digital literacy and to help us think<br>about things like meetings that matter<br>and so on and I I don't think we're<br>there yet there is still resistance to<br>teams I get it but if you're out here<br>and you're resistant I will give you 20<br>minutes coaching and then you will be so<br>much better off um and I just want to<br>acknowledge the faculty of Science<br>Leadership uh group the level six I<br>think we have the most fun in the entire<br>University so um to I know John you've<br>got a few more months left there's going<br>to be a new Dean coming in we've lost<br>Linda she's at um Bruce Springsteen<br>tonight and we've got changes but anyone<br>coming into the faculty of science are<br>dead lucky because it's just such a<br>great bunch of people who uh really know<br>how to work well together um so thank<br>you faculty of science um and I also<br>want to talk about um the Seas that<br>increasingly underpin my leadership<br>practice and the C's I'm talking about<br>really relate to work as an influencer<br>as opposed to a line manager although<br>you could take these into line<br>management and the three C's that are<br>really important to me connect convene<br>and catalyze because you do not know<br>what will happen if you do that and if<br>you do it with generosity and putting<br>the m in to set those connections those<br>convening and that Catalyst Catalyst up<br>then some really amazing things can come<br>out of it and one of the things I'm<br>deeply proud of is the team that's<br>Illustrated here but not just here<br>Caroline you were pivotal in this and<br>there are many others who really help<br>build fetu Center for climate<br>biodiversity and Society we did it on<br>teams okay just saying okay but thank<br>you you were brilliant I really<br>appreciated it and lastly<br>um what what of the University sector<br>well I'm here as Testament to the<br>transformative power of a university I<br>came here as a 33y old um to retrain a<br>lifelong learner I was so scared because<br>I just did not know if I had the smarts<br>to be able to do it so it was super<br>scary and um I did it and I did it off<br>the back of the sort of support and the<br>Curiosity driven teaching that you get<br>at a university like that this<br>absolutely inspired me let me have a<br>fantastic life for which I'm grateful<br>and I hope in turn I've been able to<br>inspire some people at this University<br>through my teaching my supervision and<br>my leadership work to uh continue on<br>because this University is a university<br>that not just Oakland but the whole<br>country can be proud of it is a global<br>University of immense standing and it is<br>that because of the people that make the<br>university up now I think we can do<br>better um some people would say it's the<br>end of the golden age for universities<br>because the numbers of students coming<br>in have probably hit a peak um<br>governments and students aren't as<br>prepared to pay as much um as they need<br>to to actually cover the costs and a<br>lots of people like this KPMG article<br>will have a bit of a poke at the<br>University sector but that's cuz they're<br>eyeing it up um I actually think the<br>next 25 years should be the Platinum age<br>for universities we've got a lot to do<br>we um if we're Unleashed we really can<br>be the transformative power I think of<br>our societies now it's not just research<br>it's ethics it's critic it's conscience<br>because we are going to need to be the<br>place The Crucible for understanding and<br>even arting knowledge because of the<br>enormous changes that are upon us so um<br>my last slide is coming up is this one<br>here now I just want to give a little<br>bit of a shout out to Jude who's really<br>seen me through all of these crazy<br>leadership years oh my goodness and um<br>not only that not only the time spent on<br>leadership and on trying to get to<br>professor and whatnot but all my hobbies<br>um and my obsessions from sheep dog<br>training to dog agility to um now<br>painting thank you Jude um your support<br>is absolutely appreciated um Ker<br>I I was expecting hickling and I didn't<br>get<br>any isn't she great she even made me<br>like<br>teenss J thank you for that that was a<br>questions I think she answered all our<br>questions don't be shy<br>now yep I'm still worried about the<br>Alpine fall K I don't blame you me too<br>AIT more about that well it's going to<br>pop its clogs and there's going to be<br>lots and lots of landslides and then<br>when it does that the West Coast all of<br>those rivers are going to a grade or the<br>rubble's going to come down and cause<br>those rivers to rise up and flood the<br>West so yeah it's going to be a pickle<br>and there's going to be a bit of ground<br>shaking we've noticed a little bit we've<br>the news recently about white Island com<br>at how's that influenc some of your more<br>recent work that that's offshore and we<br>also getting some movements in the north<br>island with a number of ques that been<br>happening in the news media early hours<br>of the morning yeah there's always going<br>to be Quakes um um we snap crackle pop<br>all the time we the white Islands linked<br>to the ones on land I wouldn't think so<br>but um white Island was uh I felt um<br>gutted when white Island uh erupt did<br>because I'd been there twice and I<br>didn't want to go back because I thought<br>it was unsafe and I and here am I in my<br>role and I did nothing about that it<br>didn't occur to me to do anything about<br>that and uh that complacency if more<br>people had stood up who knew<br>geoscientists who' gone out to White<br>Island who stood up and said guys you<br>know this is not this is not good um<br>maybe it would have made a<br>difference is there anything that's<br>indicat why are we getting a lot more<br>activity in the north Ireland in the<br>last few<br>months I'm not aware of that just we get<br>11 radio during the night you hear<br>various ones that indicating we getting<br>four to six could could be we get a lot<br>of<br>questions must be time for a<br>drink J I wants a drink so it's time to<br>go<br>thank you J welcome to the academy<br>thanks</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
