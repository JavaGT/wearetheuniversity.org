Antarctic Ice Sheet melt and changes in global mean sea level are a clear indicator of this warming climate, with impacts worldwide. But local factors including land subsidence or uplift also cause changes in relative sea level that drive shoreline shifts. How do we know how much sea level will change along our extensive coastline as time passes? Can global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions slow down or stop Antarctic Ice Sheet melt? Or have we crossed an irreversible climate threshold that will cause sea level to rise by multiple metres over coming centuries? What do communities need to know now to avoid maladaptation and what can the science community do to help make this knowledge available and useful?<br><br>In this inaugural lecture, Professor Levy takes us on a journey to uncover remarkable geological records from Antarctica that offer insight into the drivers of ice sheet change through time. He discusses work that connects knowledge from our deep south to sea level science, and will share examples of outreach activities that bring this critical information to communities in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>a very warm welcome to family friends<br>distinguished guests academic and<br>professional colleagues students and to<br>our wider community<br>to the inaugural lecture of Richard Levy<br>professor of geoscience in the Antarctic<br>Research Center inaugural lectures are<br>one of the more Charming peculiar<br>traditions of universities where<br>somebody who has given dozens possibly<br>hundreds of lectures previously is<br>invited to give an inaugural lecture but<br>it's an inaugural lecture because this<br>time for the first time Richard will be<br>presenting to friends family loved ones<br>his greatest supporters and presenting<br>as a professor<br>we have many reasons to be proud of<br>Richard he is a Vic alumnus he gained<br>his Bachelor and Masters here in science<br>in the<br>1990s he completed his PhD at the<br>University of Nebraska Lincoln in the US<br>and at the same time as completing a PhD<br>in geosciences completed a master's of<br>Science teaching and Richard gives great<br>credit to his parents for encouraging<br>Graduate Studies as back in the '90s<br>um kiwi shall we say might not have been<br>supportive of Graduate Studies when you<br>could go out and get a real job because<br>let's face it where's a PhD going to<br>take<br>yet in this case it took Richard in the<br>first instance to Nebraska where he not<br>only got a PhD he met Amy who was to<br>become his wife she was studying for her<br>degree in Psychology now Richard tells<br>this story Amy worked in a brew pub that<br>he and his mates from geology would<br>frequent and Amy anonymously sent him a<br>tasty out beer while she was working one<br>evening and it was at that point as<br>Richard said in his own words that he<br>knew something was going to happen well<br>something clearly did at least twice and<br>their daughters are here tonight sopia<br>and<br>may welcome and it's great for you to be<br>here supporting your<br>dad Richard freely admits that his time<br>away in the field has sometimes put<br>pressure on the family but Amy has<br>always been supportive and acknowledged<br>the importance of his work and now our<br>professor Levy is a glacial<br>stratigrapher that doesn't mean he's a<br>very slow moving stratigrapher it means<br>he's a stratigrapher of glaciers and a<br>paleoclimatologist with an expertise in<br>microfossil analysis he uses this<br>expertise to reveal the evolution of<br>Earth's climate over the past 40 million<br>years rather more recently than that his<br>work has focused on predicting sea level<br>change and its impacts on a and the<br>world Richard's list of research<br>achievements is too long to detail here<br>but includes being co-leader of the<br>melting ice Rising Seas team that won<br>the prime minister's science prize in<br>2019 and in 2023 he received a Sita<br>Blake award for leadership<br>amongst his many current research<br>projects He is co-chief scientist of an<br>ambitious International project that<br>will drill through the Ross sea ice<br>shelf which doesn't sound dodgy at all<br>and into the sediments below the sea<br>floor and he will head off Antarctica to<br>lead a large team of Engineers Drillers<br>and scientists in November this year<br>that'll be his 15th visit to the to the<br>Antarctic Richard isn't just ours to<br>claim we share him with gns where he was<br>recently appointed the chief science<br>advisor and along with colleagues at gns<br>he has developed geoc camp and tiura<br>fenua these are communitybased sorry<br>Community focused Science Education<br>initiatives and between them have<br>received several<br>Awards I think this reflects his passion<br>for teaching and science communication<br>and he works hard to help new zealanders<br>of every age engage in climate change<br>issues and<br>Solutions in this his inaugural lecture<br>uh we will be amongst his students as he<br>takes us on a journey to explore the<br>fascinating world of the Antarctic and<br>the geological records hidden beneath<br>the ice that inform sea level science as<br>such it is my very great pleasure to<br>introduce Professor Richard Ley<br>um thanks very much Professor James for<br>that for that introduction I'm G to<br>embellish upon upon some of the things<br>you you've already said as I as I give<br>my presentation tonight um thanks to all<br>for coming along this evening it really<br>is a thrill to see so many family and<br>friends here in the<br>audience and I'm really rather nervous<br>as I usually speak to a somewhat<br>Anonymous audience who are not as likely<br>to give me honest feedback once I'm<br>done and to those of you I don't yet<br>know I hope you enjoy the evening and I<br>look forward to talking to you if we get<br>a chance following my<br>presentation this evening I will share<br>with with you some of my experiences in<br>Antarctica really rather a spectacular<br>place as you can see from the image I<br>took from the freeze Hills looking<br>towards the vast expanse of the East<br>Antarctic<br>euma this faki simply states that Akuma<br>never speaks of its sweetness and<br>captures the discomfort many of us feel<br>when asked to speak about ourselves but<br>my American family in 15 years living in<br>the middle of the United States has<br>taught me that it's okay to be proud and<br>to poke your head above the poppies<br>every now and<br>then so bear with me as I talk a little<br>bit about my personal Journey this this<br>evening of course I plan to focus<br>on my Antarctic adventures and suspect<br>that's what many of you have come here<br>to hear about I will also talk briefly<br>about the sea Lev research that I've<br>been doing with colleagues across our<br>country<br>country I will touch on some of the<br>really cool community outreach<br>initiatives that I've been invol<br>involved in over the years and we'll<br>finish with an intro to our exciting Su<br>to see project on the Ross ice shelf now<br>I'm going to apologize now for going<br>over time as there is a lot to say and I<br>found it really difficult to cut things<br>out so so so apologies Mana huruhuru<br>KIU with many feathers the bird will fly<br>to my family and friends who have<br>supported me over the years and to all<br>my colleagues who have been instrumental<br>in the work I'm about to present I thank<br>alone so I was born in lowah Hut in 1968<br>a couple of months before Cyclone<br>jaizelle met a cold front from the<br>Antarctic my mom tells a story of having<br>to drive down from the heights of Kelson<br>to avoid 150 mph winds that tore roofs<br>from houses across the region that day<br>the wahini ran around and lives were<br>lost the concentration of atmospheric<br>carbon dioxide on this day when an<br>incredibly rare but devastating storm<br>hit Wellington with 325 parts per<br>million later that same year three<br>humans flew to the moon for the first<br>time astronaut William Anders took this<br>iconic image of Earth rising above the<br>lunar Horizon giving us all a clear view<br>of our fragile planet with its swirling<br>interconnected atmosphere oceans and<br>ecosystems Anders passed away earlier<br>this month but what a life to live one<br>at the Forefront of<br>masteron and in 1986 made my way back to<br>Wellington to study architecture here at<br>Victoria University of Wellington to<br>heading<br>aaka I met some great friends maybe they<br>weren't so great but I met some great<br>friends and had a fantastic time but<br>study didn't go so well I missed so many<br>lectures that my rather poor exam of<br>performance meant I had to change<br>direction I returned in 1987 to study<br>geology atmospheric CO2 concentration<br>was 345 parts per<br>million by the 1990s I was pretty hooked<br>on geoscience and embarked on my<br>Master's Degree choosing to study ous<br>rocks in the par Valley in mbor my dad<br>ventured into the hills with me as my<br>field<br>assistant climbing Hills and filling his<br>backpack with<br>rocks I'm really truly grateful to my<br>parents Jackie and Keith both of whom<br>are here tonight when many many people<br>around me suggested that getting a job<br>was a better option Mom and Dad backed<br>me and supported me as I continued my to<br>chase a not so clear but really engaging<br>path in 1991 our atmospheric CO2<br>concentration was 356 parts per<br>million in 1993 I was offered the chance<br>of a lifetime a trip to Antarctica with<br>a young Gary Wilson and my soon to be<br>PhD adviser David Harwood upon return<br>from the Deep South I headed to the<br>large expansive flatness of the Midwest<br>United States at the UN and to study at<br>the University of Nebraska Lincoln<br>US sorry girls sorry about that when I<br>arrived in the US I thought I was<br>destined to drink horrendous American<br>Beer for the foreseeable future lucky<br>for me there was an excellent Craft<br>brewery in town perhaps even luckier for<br>me this Brewery is where I met my wife<br>Amy Amy is here tonight with our two<br>daughters Sophia and Maya Amy you and<br>the girls have always told me that the<br>work I do is important and for that I<br>grateful the support encouragement and<br>love you have given me over the years is<br>the primary reason I am able to stand<br>here tonight and offer this inaugural<br>inaugural<br>lecture now I show these two photos to<br>make a couple of points this is Sophia<br>at Christmas in<br>2003 I think it's a little dinosaur on<br>her her um pajamas<br>um atmospheric CO2 concentrations with<br>376 parts per million at this time 50<br>parts per million higher than in the<br>year I was<br>born this photo also shows that I<br>refused to give up my architectural<br>dreams and built built s an exact<br>replica of lusia's villa<br>savoir to include a Barbie Volkswagen in<br>the garage or or garage as I would have<br>said back<br>then I also wanted to say thanks to you<br>all for letting me drag you to<br>geological sites that were off the<br>beaten path on this occasion to walk in<br>the footsteps of dinosaurs in the middle<br>of Wyoming when we visited this site 2<br>2010 atmospheric CO2 concentration was<br>390 PS per<br>million I was in India last<br>week on May 29th atmospheric CO2<br>concentrations were 427 parts per<br>million and a new record temperature of<br>49.9 degrees C was set in New<br>Delhi it is unequivocal the burning of<br>fossil fuels has driven CO2 to levels<br>that are unprecedented in human history<br>between<br>1968 the year of the W disaster in the<br>Apollo 8 mission and today CO2 has<br>climbed over 100 parts per million<br>Earth's average temperature has Ren<br>risen 1.2 de C over the past Century and<br>climate records are being broken across<br>our<br>planet sea level has risen by 20 cm on<br>average across the planet and will<br>continue to<br>rise much of the research that my<br>colleagues and I are currently<br>conducting<br>is focused on<br>predicting just how much sea level will<br>rise in the future and how this change<br>will affect Coastal communities around<br>the<br>world but to understand how our planet's<br>eye sheets will change in the future we<br>often look to the<br>past I have spent much of my career<br>looking to Earth's geological record to<br>examine how the Antarctic eye sheets<br>responded to past intervals of<br>environment Al<br>variability and climate change and for<br>the next 10 to 15 minutes I want to<br>share some examples of This research<br>with<br>you I'm going to focus on two key time<br>intervals the eosin alosine transition<br>and the mid-ming climate<br>transition these will be on the test at<br>the<br>end episodes where large environmental<br>changes are recorded in a range of<br>geological archives<br>these episodes also record shifts in<br>atmospheric CO2 that likely represent<br>thresholds in the climate system across<br>which we see fundamental changes in our<br>Earth<br>system now I'm going to go off script<br>because that's I just wanted to write<br>all that stuff down so I got it nailed<br>right so now now now bear with me I'm<br>going to go back into my my my free mode<br>which is sometimes<br>dangerous before we get too much further<br>a little bit of a geography lesson for<br>those of you that aren't entirely um<br>aware of of Antarctica the map on your<br>left is a map of Antarctica and it<br>highlights that it's divided into two<br>pretty distinct areas west Antarctica<br>and East Antarctica the East antarctic<br>ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice<br>sheet sitting there on this on this land<br>mass now if we were to have a magic<br>ability to remove the ice sheet from<br>from Antarctica what the continent would<br>look like is that map on your<br>right it shows areas in blue that sit<br>today would sit today below sea level<br>these are Marine areas and where the ice<br>sits on the ground in those regions we<br>call them marine-based ice sheets those<br>parts of the Antarctic I sheet are most<br>vulnerable to warming because they're<br>sensing and feeling the warming oceans<br>um that we're experiencing today the the<br>colors in Greens and and oranges and and<br>yellows are areas that would be be above<br>land now I'm also going to try to give<br>you a very very quick and brief lesson<br>in how we use our understanding of the<br>modern system of how the modern ice<br>sheets and the environments that sit<br>around them and beneath them um what<br>what types of sediments are in those<br>environments how we use that to help us<br>reconstruct change through time so this<br>is an image um<br>showing uh it's a photograph across<br>Antarctica and in the distance you would<br>see you see parts of the ice sheet that<br>are sitting on land below the ice so<br>that's what we call a grounded ice sheet<br>it's actually sitting on on land it's<br>some point that grounded ice sheet<br>starts to float and form an ice shelf<br>this is actually still still directly<br>connected to the grounded ice sheet but<br>it's starting to float out onto the<br>ocean these these these regions that the<br>ice shelves sea ice forms um seasonally<br>around the continent melts mostly in the<br>summer and then forms again in the<br>winter and that that's um that's that's<br>what we call Sea ice and then the open<br>ocean is of course areas that are that<br>are ice free if we were to slice a um<br>make a slice through that image that I<br>just showed this is sort of what it<br>would look like you can see the land the<br>Bedrock here in brown um coming into<br>into this point here which is called the<br>grounding Zone where the grounded ice<br>the ice sheet here starts to float and<br>form that ice shelf and again floating<br>sea ice<br>here now if we were to go to the ground<br>and look at the types of sediment that<br>are forming in these environments these<br>are the types of differences we would<br>see the differ types of sediments we<br>would see if I was to dive down to the<br>Sea Flor in the open Marine setting I'm<br>going to see sediments that form in an<br>open Marine um under open Marine<br>conditions often comprised of marine<br>algae things that live in the open ocean<br>if we were to swim in closer to the<br>grounding Zone beneath the ice shelf<br>you're going to see sediments that look<br>more like the sub ice shelf sediments<br>and if we were able to dig down and pop<br>our heads up right beneath the ice sheet<br>the grounded ice sheet and look at the<br>types of sediments that we're forming<br>we'd see things that look like this<br>these these diamic diets and so as<br>geologists we're always looking for<br>strator graphic sections sections where<br>rocks are stacked one on top of the<br>other and these are the types of things<br>we might see uh a subglacial sediment<br>with a sub ice shelf sediment stacked on<br>top of it with an open Marine sequence<br>or sediment type stacked on top of that<br>on top of that a subis shelf sediment<br>and then a subglacial sediment again and<br>what that sequence of rocks is showing<br>us is a is a cycle of of glacial Advance<br>Retreat and advance so at the bottom the<br>ice is sitting um over over the spot in<br>on Earth that we're interested in the<br>ice Retreats it becomes an ice shelf<br>Retreats again open ocean and then you<br>get another advance so it's these cycles<br>of advance and Retreat advance and<br>Retreat that we can decipher by looking<br>at these sediments that's pretty much<br>what I've done for a<br>living we can also add other Clues to<br>help us interpret the past this is a<br>picture rather beautiful picture<br>um of of a datom this is the shell of a<br>marine algae um a type of marine algae<br>when we find these things it helps us<br>understand a little bit more about the<br>environment what the temperature was in<br>the ocean how far away we were from the<br>ice were we in truly open ocean<br>conditions or in areas that were<br>occupied by sea ice so using these<br>microorganisms and the sediments in<br>which they're contained we can start to<br>reconstruct um the history of<br>Antarctica now it's unfortunately not so<br>simple as just going down to Antartica<br>finding these rocks and doing our work<br>because this stuff this ice covers most<br>of the continent this is a photograph I<br>took last season flying from New Zealand<br>down to Antarctica out the window of the<br>Hercules and it's beautiful right these<br>amazing ice covered snow covered<br>mountains with glaciers flowing through<br>the mountain stunningly beautiful views<br>but they the ice covers the damn rocks<br>and we want to see the Rocks so we want<br>to get rid of the ice so we can see the<br>Rocks but we don't want to get rid of<br>the ice cuz that causes sea level to<br>rise so it's a real challenge there are<br>places around Antarctica that are ice<br>free this is an example again of a<br>fairly stunning landscape taken at the<br>um taken from a helicopter in the upper<br>parts of the right Valley in the<br>transantarctic mountains this is a<br>location called The Labyrinth for for<br>Fairly obvious reasons um and the rocks<br>that are exposed in these mountains are<br>old they are too old really for for the<br>time interval that I'm interested in<br>studying these are 460 to 176 million<br>years old we want to find the younger<br>rocks to help us um understand the more<br>recent history now now glaciers have<br>this ability to ground out rocks at<br>their base and bring them to the surface<br>just like a bulldozer might bring rocks<br>to the surface as it plows through the<br>ground glaciers can do the same thing so<br>we have to be creative we we use the<br>fact that ice can actually grab rocks<br>from beneath bring them to the surface<br>where we can actually study them these<br>um rocks that are young enough but<br>buried beneath the ice bring them to the<br>surface so that we can study them and<br>start to try to piece together the<br>history of Antarctica and that's what I<br>did for much of my my PhD and and<br>subsequent studies this is an image<br>taken in<br>2010 um Steve Bart a longtime colleague<br>U with did a masters at University of<br>Nebraska um I've kept in touch with them<br>ever since and Gary Wilson um sitting<br>there who who I've worked with many many<br>for for many many years and was the<br>person who of course originally invited<br>me down to Antarctica so many thanks to<br>Gary but in the distance you can see all<br>of these Boulders scattered across the<br>surface these are erratics that have<br>been ground out from beneath the ice and<br>dumped at the surface through this<br>glacial erosion and depositional process<br>and so if you walk around and look at<br>the ground long enough and hard enough<br>you can find rocks and pick up those<br>rocks crack them open find out what's in<br>them and start to piece together the<br>history of the continent that is<br>otherwise<br>hidden and what's quite amazing is some<br>of these rocks um when you crack them<br>open in the field like this one here you<br>you find fossil leaves right so this is<br>a this is a fossil Leaf impression um<br>from one of these Boulders that we<br>cracked open this here is a is a crab<br>claw you can see the crab um claw in a<br>burrow just cracking these rocks open<br>seeing these fossils it's quite<br>remarkable it's kind of like Christmas<br>um maybe not such a great Christmas but<br>it's kind of like Christmas and then and<br>then you you also if you start to<br>process these rocks you can find these<br>tiny microfossils these are dagul cysts<br>that help us understand the age and the<br>environment in which the Rocks were were<br>deposited these are microfossils and<br>even sharks teeth we've found crocodile<br>um teeth we've found bird bones all<br>sorts of things in these rocks the<br>problem is they're all jumbled up and<br>they're out of order so you've got to<br>try and jigs or puzzle them back<br>together to get some sense of what the<br>environment was like in the past you can<br>also study the sediments again here you<br>can see some examples of rocks cut into<br>thin section with a with a mollusk in it<br>in this case these sandstones but you<br>also find rocks that are diamictites<br>that indicate glacial um glacial<br>activity so we put all of these things<br>together and what we were able to show<br>was that all of the rocks that are older<br>than 34 million years ago ago these e<br>aged rocks are the ones that show warmth<br>fossil leaves crabs all of those warm<br>things and the ones that are typically D<br>MCD postate 33 million years and so<br>we've crossed that eosine transition<br>where we've gone from a th parts per<br>million CO2 in the atmosphere to less<br>than 800 parts per million and we've<br>grown ice sheets and so it suggests that<br>there's a threshold in the system a CO2<br>threshold in the system across which you<br>go from trees no trees no ice lots of<br>ice problem is it's not in a stratagraph<br>order so another way to get to the Rocks<br>beneath the ice is to drill and and in<br>in the early 2000s I got brought into<br>the Antarctic geological drilling<br>program which was a real um major step<br>in my career that pushed me back in a<br>direction that ultimately ended up um<br>bringing me back home and um just want<br>to acknowledge this was the first time I<br>met Tim n who again is in the in the<br>room today and this this this was sort<br>of the start of I don't want to get too<br>cheesy here Tim um this was this was the<br>start of a very long partnership that<br>we've had we've done a hell of a lot of<br>things together in the Antarctic um<br>that's ultimately led to us um<br>developing and driving a lot of the sea<br>level rise research that's been um<br>pretty critical for altero in New<br>Zealand so so thanks Tim we'll continue<br>the work but it's it was a it was a<br>great to meet you back then and we'll<br>keep on going Andrew was able to drill<br>beneath the ice and get those rocks that<br>were all where they all jumbled up and<br>all out of sequence could actually get<br>them in sequence bring them to the<br>surface by Drilling and I wanted to put<br>this up here just to make make people<br>Gran a little bit because this is the<br>sort of stuff I deal with on a<br>relatively routine basis putting Wiggles<br>together on on pieces of paper trying to<br>bring all the the geological data we're<br>collecting from these rocks together to<br>help us interpret um interpret the past<br>and and in a nutshell what came out of<br>this work this this Andre SMS project<br>looking at the um mayia scene was that<br>when we had times when CO2 was well<br>above 400 parts per million we tended to<br>have ice sheets and evidence that ice<br>sheets that look like this so no Marine<br>based ice sheets just terrestrial ice<br>sheets so smaller than today when CO2<br>was just above 400 parts per million no<br>Marine ice sheets and when we drop below<br>400 parts per million we see evidence<br>for these marine-based ice sheets so it<br>tends to suggest there's a threshold in<br>the system at 400 parts per million<br>below which we have large Marine based<br>eyce sheets above which we lose our<br>marine based ice sheets and start to<br>shrink the terrestrial I sheets which<br>tends to suggest there's a lot there's a<br>high sensitivity to CO2 in the system<br>now when we model the um data and I<br>certainly don't model I'm not a modeler<br>but we work with modelers um a couple of<br>um faces of people that I've worked with<br>here and just want to acknowledge them<br>um Ed Gasson Dave poot and Rob dto ran<br>these models again and showed that in<br>even in the models this 400 parts per<br>million threshold somewhere between 580<br>you have no Marine based ice sheets and<br>at 280 you have Marine based ice sheets<br>so it tends to suggest there's the<br>sensitivity in that system if you think<br>about that we're at 427 parts per<br>million today right so we've gone above<br>that<br>threshold these are all Marine records<br>offshore in 2014 we were lucky enough to<br>team up with Adam Lewis a professor at<br>the at North Dakota State University um<br>who had done a lot of work in the<br>transantarctic mountains hunting for<br>these very rare terrestrial outcrops of<br>of relatively young rocks and this is<br>the this is the Taylor Glacier in the<br>freeze Hills and right up on top here is<br>a little deposit of my or Fair extensive<br>deposit of Meine age and Adam and said<br>to us he knew we were pretty good at<br>Drilling and so he said why don't you<br>guys come into the field and drill this<br>for us and so we went in with Webster<br>drilling acknowledging Tony King and<br>I've worked with him since Andre days<br>and Al Alex Pine whom I have known since<br>I was an undergraduate um in the field<br>helping us drill these records um with<br>Tim Hannah chy Adam Lewis uh and a bunch<br>of others Nick goge involved in this<br>project um to recover these records<br>these terrestrial records through that<br>400 parts per million transition and<br>this is really cool too we we get these<br>rocks back we bringing them back to<br>altero and then we take them to the<br>nearest medical facility so we rock up<br>to these um to these hospitals with<br>boxes full of rocks and ask if we can<br>pass them through the CT scanner we have<br>to pay for this it's not cheap but they<br>um the the the the the radiographers<br>always say they really enjoy this<br>because it's better than just scanning<br>bones all the time so they get to to<br>scan these um these rocks and what<br>you're seeing here as a CT scan of of<br>one of the cores from the freeze Hills<br>going from a diamic diet into these<br>layered sediments that a water Lane into<br>so so a lake or a river in a lake system<br>and then up through the sequence and<br>back into the the glacial sediments<br>again so another another one of these<br>glacial Cycles but what's really key<br>about this is it shows there's a lot of<br>water around where today there's none<br>you can dig into these rocks and pull<br>out things like like this little bits of<br>from Plants um diatoms you can see um a<br>fossil um Leaf here again a oop fagus<br>Leaf um from from these from these<br>sequences pollen and spores that tell us<br>the these sorts of plants here grew in<br>the freeze Hills back in the myene when<br>CO2 was above 400 parts per million so<br>much warmer much wetter much more<br>vegetation um when CO2 is above 400<br>parts per Mill just to sort of emphasize<br>that this is what the environment looks<br>like today this is the hallene today um<br>CO2 is 280 parts per million and the<br>mean summer temperature up in the free<br>hes is -3° C pretty chilly um not not<br>atypical for Antarctica and this is what<br>it was like um when those rocks that we<br>drilled um when we drilled this is what<br>the environment would have been like at<br>the time that those rocks were being<br>deposited middle myosin interg glacial<br>carbon dioxide above 400 parts per<br>million mean summer temperature 4 to 6<br>degrees so almost 20° warmer than today<br>and lots of vegetation and water so a<br>very different environment again<br>suggesting that the entire Antarctic<br>system is sensitive to this threshold<br>all<br>right that's hopefully giving you a bit<br>of a taste of of of what we do in the<br>Antarctic to try to understand how the<br>ice sheet responds to climate forcing to<br>how how the ice sheets might respond to<br>these CO2 thresholds but of course what<br>happens in Antarctica doesn't stay in<br>Antarctica and as the ice sheet is<br>warming as the climate is warming today<br>and the ice sheets are starting to melt<br>that water goes into the ocean and is<br>causing sea level to rise and so about a<br>number of years ago now Tim and I me<br>we're um lying um we were lying in in in<br>our tent in Antarctica um discussing you<br>know what was the what was the thing<br>that we should really be focusing on and<br>Tim was adamant we've got to focus more<br>on the effects of Antarctica in Alto in<br>New Zealand and so put together a big<br>project to try to better understand how<br>sea level will will change in the future<br>and we were lucky enough to get funding<br>um for that and start the New Zealand<br>sea Rise program to tario Alo which is<br>also now um morphed into uh another<br>version where we're looking at hazards<br>resulting related to se of Rise called<br>out T Hur tall um when you talk to new<br>zealanders and you talk about Antarctica<br>they're somewhat F somewhat fascinated<br>by it but what really matters to them is<br>is how is change in Antartica going to<br>affect us here in in New Zealand how um<br>much will sea level rise how soon and<br>about so what we did we we we said right<br>there's a lot of work that's gone on<br>globally to try to understand how<br>Antarctica will change in the future how<br>the glaciers will retreat in the future<br>how the oceans are warming and expanding<br>causing sea level to rise we don't need<br>to reinvent that wheel because there's a<br>lot of people all around the world doing<br>really awesome work trying to figure<br>that out and it was all compiled um most<br>recently in the intergovernmental panel<br>on climate change assessment report six<br>so that information was available to us<br>but what we realized was that there are<br>many local effects that matter that can<br>cause sea level to rise faster or slower<br>so these local effects um Can can really<br>impact your local communities and that's<br>what we chose to focus on bringing that<br>Regional information together with the<br>local information to provide location<br>specific relevant sea level projections<br>for people in altero vertical land<br>movement is the is the key local effect<br>that that can impact sea level rise all<br>around our Coastline right now uh it's<br>moving I'm not talking just during<br>earthquakes it's moving as we speak<br>right now the Wellington region in<br>general is going down at about three 2<br>to 3 millimeters per year um as I'm<br>standing here speaking and in areas<br>where the land is sinking or subsiding<br>that causes sea level to rise faster<br>right so climates causing the ice sheets<br>to melt causing sea level to rise<br>globally but that land drop dropping<br>accelerates the rate of sea level rise<br>of course in areas where the land is<br>going up it slows down the rate of sea<br>level rise so knowing this if you're a<br>planner is really really important<br>because it helps you forecast and adapt<br>to uh to Future change with more<br>certainty we pulled all of this<br>information together in working with um<br>a group up in Oakland takwa um produced<br>a a series of maps that can be<br>accessible online to to to anyone and<br>what those Maps show is the amount that<br>sea level will Arise at a Loca any<br>location around our Coastline space two<br>2 km apart and you can look at both the<br>sea level rise without vertical land<br>movement or you can turn vertical land<br>movement on to get the to get the rate<br>of sea level rise so you can you can<br>experiment you can you can see um the<br>different effect of the different um<br>influences on sea level rizon and and<br>use that in your in your planning um<br>this tool gained a lot of attention um<br>mostly positive and um and we've<br>actually just gone through a second<br>release um about a week ago to to update<br>our our our data but feedback has been<br>that this has been really useful a<br>useful tool to<br>have now knowing just how much sea level<br>will rise is really important means sea<br>level rise is really important but what<br>I think what I know a lot of people<br>don't really appreciate is that<br>relatively small amounts of sea Lev rise<br>can have a big effect so often I'll I<br>I'll give talks at at various fora and<br>you might say sea level is going to rise<br>10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and people sort of go<br>that's that's really not that much don't<br>have to worry but colleagues at Nea have<br>shown that a 30 cm sea level rise in<br>Wellington turns what is today a rare<br>event a rare one in 100y year event<br>something that doesn't happen very often<br>into something that's going to happen<br>every year just 30 centimeters of sea<br>rise so something like the wahin storm<br>cyclone jaelle in 196 which was a very<br>rare<br>event it caused a lot of flooding now<br>that rare event we're not going to get a<br>whole bunch more necessarily a whole<br>bunch more wahini scale storms but with<br>a little bit of sea level rise what it<br>means is those smaller storms will have<br>the same flooding effect that the<br>wahini um storm had so it's that slight<br>increase in um in mean sea level turns<br>these smaller events into events that<br>today have a fairly significant flooding<br>impact because infrastructure is not<br>built to uh built to to handle those<br>some of the storms will get bigger<br>because we're putting more energy into<br>the atmosphere there's more water in the<br>atmosphere those storms will get bigger<br>but it's that small increase in sea<br>level rise that um causes the problem<br>and I and and just bear with me I I I've<br>used this um example a number of times<br>and and and I hopefully it helps you<br>understand the concept I was just trying<br>to trying to speak to um imagine you<br>you're a basketball player or or let's<br>let's consider a BAS basketball player<br>in the NBA I'm told and and if you go do<br>a Google search they generally can jump<br>about 60 C 60 cm off the<br>ground and if you're threshold the thing<br>that you're um that you have to breach<br>in order to in this case dunk the<br>basketball is the is the hoop and you<br>jump off the ground 60 cm then you may<br>only dunk once every 10 attempts just<br>because it's hard right the threshold is<br>quite<br>high of course if you start pouring a<br>whole bunch of polyurethane or varnish<br>on the floor of the of the gym and you<br>start causing the gym to rise slightly<br>every time you jump it's now easier to<br>dunk that ball right You' you've just<br>raised the floor slightly you're jumping<br>the same height but now you you you're<br>able to dunk much more easily because<br>you're able to breach that<br>threshold if the hoop sinks if you lower<br>the hoop you're lowering the threshold<br>your floor is high you're going to dunk<br>more frequently and then if you train a<br>whole bunch more eat a whole bunch more<br>food and energy can jump that little bit<br>higher you're going to be dunking every<br>time so you kind of see where this is<br>going right sea level rise just means<br>that it's much easier for that wave to<br>breach the breach the protection you<br>don't have to make the wave bigger it's<br>just that it's easier to breach the seaw<br>wall if you syn the seaw wall or you syn<br>the coastal in infrastructure by<br>vertical land movement again that wave<br>doesn't have to work so hard to breach<br>the to breach the um threshold and flood<br>so this is why small amounts of sea<br>level rise have a a big<br>effect all right anxiety and concern<br>Effective Education Outreach and<br>communication is key I I was I was<br>looking for a hidden sand picture the<br>other day and I was thinking I was going<br>to use a use a um an ostrich um but this<br>one came up this is this is these are<br>climate activists um that BN around the<br>world they did this recently I think<br>it's brilliant right don't stick your<br>head in the sand and ignore the problem<br>um but the challenges if you put your<br>head up and you listen and you and and<br>you try to understand the problem it<br>creates a lot of has can create quite a<br>lot of anxiety and I get a lot of<br>feedback we all get a lot of feedback<br>about how anxious people are feeling<br>about climate change and the challenges<br>it brings but our tenant is that if you<br>help people understand the problem if<br>you give them information avoid<br>disinformation provide them with the<br>power and tools to help understand and<br>grapple with the problem then it might<br>have you might have a chance to reduce<br>that anxiety slightly and we're working<br>with um with folk to to to try to<br>actually test whether or not that's<br>that's true but so one of the things<br>I've been working on is trying to bring<br>my teaching skill set as um as as Bry<br>mentioned I I trained as a teacher in<br>Nebraska and I spent a a year one year<br>only in a in a middle school and had<br>children throwing um young men throwing<br>chairs across my classroom and and and<br>you really learn to manage people so gns<br>and vuw it's easy um um it's it really<br>really is it was really an experience<br>and a half but but learning the skills<br>to actually teach and try to convey<br>information was was was valuable to me<br>and I've done research with um<br>educational Specialists uh around the<br>world just to test how how our<br>techniques um could be improved and and<br>or whether or whether or not they work<br>and when I came back to New Zealand as I<br>was able to hook up with um Kyle Bland<br>um Joe preo and Julian Thompson and<br>developed uh something we called geoc<br>Camp which was taking the skill um the<br>skill set in teaching the knowledge I<br>had in teaching and applying it to the<br>uh kids in in in New Zealand and bring<br>their teachers along to try to help<br>their teachers also learn about<br>geoscience by actively going out um into<br>the field and we generally get really<br>positive respon these are three rangah<br>up in Northland um work sitting on the<br>beach taking notes and they actually<br>were taking notes about the Rocks which<br>is which is pretty remarkable um doing<br>things like this this is you know we we<br>tell the the students let's go out and<br>build some sand castles and and they<br>think you know okay that sounds cool<br>this isn't really learning but then we<br>secretly get them to use a tape measure<br>and draw contour lines around the the<br>sand castle and so they get the concept<br>of of elevation and and and the and the<br>height change um on on a feature theyve<br>built themselves and then if you take<br>the photograph from the side and then on<br>top and you tell them well now look at a<br>map this is what you're seeing in when<br>you're looking at contour lines again<br>linking that to sea level sea level rise<br>and trying to understand elevation<br>change and really engaging um engaging<br>the students and trying to understand<br>the problems and the challenges with<br>climate<br>change um an image here just bringing<br>the Antarctic to the classroom it's not<br>always easy right but um melting ice<br>melting lots of ice I've melted lots of<br>blocks of ice with kids around the<br>country again helping them understand<br>the difference between grounded ice<br>sheets floating ice grounded ice sheets<br>AFF sea level when they meet melt<br>floating ice has very little impact just<br>getting them to understand the<br>difference between the two and also<br>understand the fact that when an i sheet<br>melt sea level goes up um lot lots of<br>lots of opportunity to to do things like<br>like<br>that also had the privilege to work with<br>various um ewi hapu maldi around the<br>country uh this is this is one example<br>of aura fena that we ran a number of<br>years ago again bringing those teaching<br>skills bringing that understanding of<br>Antarctica bringing that understanding<br>of geology and climate change to moldi<br>groups in a marai setting sleeping on<br>the marai immersing ourselves in the<br>community getting really positive<br>feedback that we're actually committed<br>to trying to help the communities<br>understand the challenge um the finding<br>that the uh that the the the um aunties<br>are then also really Keen to talk the mo<br>teach the mapuna themselves so once we<br>leave there's that ongoing um ability to<br>teach teach the communities so this is<br>the sort of stuff we want to continue<br>doing in our changing Coast working with<br>communities around the country helping<br>them understand what we've learned about<br>um sea level sea level rise and climate<br>change so that they're empowered with<br>accurate knowledge and can make<br>decisions moving forward and hopefully<br>um mitigate some of the challenges that<br>that come um and increased anxiety<br>through lack of lack of understanding<br>and lack of<br>knowledge almost<br>done where are we today this is a this<br>is a graph another graph I've managed to<br>avoid graphs for the most part so you're<br>welcome um this is a temperature curve<br>showing showing temperature increasing<br>and the key point with this particular<br>curve is that it's highlighting that<br>we're on track to exceed 1.5 Dees above<br>pre-industrial levels within the next 5<br>years or so we came pretty close this<br>year I think it got up to about 1.4 um<br>degrees above above pre-industrial<br>levels and then drop down again but<br>within the next five years it's expected<br>we will breach 1.5 briefly partly<br>because of El Nino um the ELO the<br>current El Nino cycle that we're in um<br>but we're definitely on track to uh to<br>1.5 by the early 2030s and this is not<br>good news for the planet this is that<br>key Paris<br>Target so what is 1.5° c mean for<br>Antarctica and just a little call out to<br>Nick Gage here um who whom I've also<br>worked with over the years um he's he's<br>been a great colleague introduced me to<br>modeling throw through a through a bunch<br>of really complex mathematical um<br>formulas at me in in one of the first<br>papers we wrote together I read it and<br>checked for<br>grammar wasn't very helpful with the<br>math I I didn't get to tell him that<br>that was what I actually failed in my<br>first year um at Vic when I was doing<br>architecture but um anyway um but Nick<br>had done this this study that was<br>published really quite a seminal study<br>and and and what this diagram shows you<br>and what these models output what these<br>model outputs show you is that under RCP<br>2.6 under a scenario that keeps Us close<br>to the Paris Paris agreement an emission<br>scenario that keeps Us close to the<br>Paris agreement we can actually save the<br>Ross ice shelf here's the Ross ice shelf<br>here 2100 2300 you see the ice shelf<br>sticks around Antarctica still melts<br>slightly and by 2300 just from<br>Antarctica and just in this model<br>experiment you still get 20 some cenm<br>out of Antarctica plus whatever the<br>oceans are doing plus whatever the the<br>Glaciers are doing so it's more than<br>that but you're keeping the Antarctic<br>contribution to a to to a fairly low<br>number if we follow the current pathway<br>we're on RCP 4.5 is essentially what<br>we're tracking along now in terms of<br>emissions by 2300 The Rossi shelf was<br>gone and you're closer to a meter from<br>Antarctica alone again you've got to add<br>it to everything else that's called<br>causing sea level to rise around the<br>world so save the ice shelves is is the<br>is the message from the<br>models but we also don't really have<br>enough evidence yet from Antarctica to<br>say whether or not 1.5 degrees is a is a<br>threshold whether or not it might be two<br>degrees it might be slightly warmer we<br>might have a little bit more time so<br>we've embarked on this project the space<br>2C project to look at the sensitivity of<br>the West an tartic i sheet to a Paris<br>Target and the fundamental question is<br>will the Ross ey shelf and West an<br>tartic ey Sheet collapse when<br>temperature exceeds 1.5° C we want to go<br>out to the grounding Zone to find some<br>geological records from a time in<br>Earth's past when we know temperatures<br>were about 1.5 1 to 1.5 degrees to see<br>whether or not the rosai Shelf was there<br>or not and that sort of gives us the<br>geological evidence to support some of<br>the the modeling I think if you asked<br>Tim to answer that question he would say<br>yes yeah he's nodding right there um<br>anyway we're going regardless and it's a<br>pretty awesome International project<br>involving many people there we go this<br>is we actually went out last year um and<br>and was trying to drill all the way to<br>to get the records but we had some<br>technical challenges managed to get some<br>of of the data but we have to go back<br>next year but this is just to give you a<br>sense of the scale of the of the project<br>the big red drill tent in the front<br>there lots of equipment to tow things<br>around drill equipment Camp um camp in<br>the background there on the far right<br>rather an impressive coming together of<br>Logistics in engineering and and and and<br>science to try to get to this record<br>beneath the ice shelf to give us that um<br>maybe more compelling answer to to that<br>question of of how just how sensitive is<br>the Ros ey shelf to<br>warming and on<br>that um I wanted to finish with this<br>image um thinking back to the to the<br>moonrise and the Apollo 8 mission um in<br>1968 this is um I've always found this<br>quite phenomenal right that we were able<br>to send people to the Moon and land<br>people on the moon and collect<br>geological samples from the Moon and I<br>just wanted to point out that there are<br>more samples we've collected more<br>samples from the Moon than we have from<br>West Antarctica we know more about the<br>subsurface geology of the Moon than we<br>do the grounding zone of the West<br>antartic AI so in terms of Discovery in<br>terms of exploration this is an amazing<br>place that's in our backyard that we<br>still know so little about so going back<br>and trying to find um the these rocks I<br>guess as our moonshot for uh for for my<br>lifetime so thank you very much for your<br>for your attention and um I hope you<br>learned a little bit about Antarctica<br>Antarctic research a little bit about my<br>life and um and I hope you get a sense<br>for just how important the workers we do<br>and thanks again for all your support<br>maret uh good evening my name is<br>Margaret Highland I'm the DVC research<br>here at tading aaka and it's a great<br>pleasure and a privilege to be proposing<br>this vote of thanks for our colleague<br>Professor uh Richard Levy and um despite<br>appearances I'm not really much of a<br>traditionalist but this tradition of the<br>inaugural lecture is one that I really<br>love and I really support it's our<br>chance to um to celebrate our new<br>professors um a chance to hear from uh<br>our passionate people about the work<br>that they do and so in that vein it's uh<br>great to see everybody here tonight um<br>to to support and to uh celebrate<br>Richard and his achievements so good to<br>see your um family here Richard um your<br>your colleagues our colleagues at your<br>other workplace gns because of course we<br>share Richard with gns or they share him<br>with us um colleagues at the Antarctic<br>Research Center um my colleagues in Taha<br>um and uh colleagues just from around<br>the University<br>good to see you here so this in this<br>inaugural lecture Richard has uh<br>cogently eloquently passionately and I<br>think<br>imaginatively demonstrated how the<br>Earth's past natural<br>experiments provide important Clues as<br>to how the Antarctic Ice Sheets will<br>respond to elevated atmospheric carbon<br>dioxide because of course the behavior<br>of these ice sheets is such a critical<br>driver of climate systems they can point<br>towards the probable future effects of<br>the climate<br>change so put another way and um mixing<br>metaphors the time machine that is the<br>geological record is also a crystal ball<br>to look into the<br>future and by examining those threshold<br>levels like the mid mocine 400 PPM<br>CO2 do I get a tick thank<br>you um uh those those are the conditions<br>that trigger change<br>we can also understand a bit about the<br>likelihood of future melting or future<br>refreezing of of those ey sheets and<br>their effect on<br>climate um one of Richard's colleagues<br>described him as being genuinely<br>interested in understanding how the<br>world works and I think we saw that<br>tonight in the kind of joy of of uh<br>discovery of what the Rocks reveal um<br>and as a truly curiosity driven<br>researcher um but it's also clear that<br>although genuine curiosity may be one<br>motivator for for Richard and his and<br>his work it's also clear that he's<br>really driven by making a<br>difference and this means that he's had<br>to do uh some things that strike fear<br>Into the Heart of many scientists and<br>that is Step Beyond your narrow field of<br>expertise and um to go out to talk to<br>policy makers to engage with<br>communities um and I speak as a lap<br>Scientist by the way so I know that this<br>can be a real challenge for many of us<br>but it's something uh as we can see that<br>Richard has really<br>embraced and I suspect that in part<br>that's your slightly less than<br>conventional pathway into research<br>that's given you um some of the skills<br>and experience to draw on that's that's<br>allowed you to do that so both your time<br>and Industry and obviously your your<br>teaching experience and your your<br>passion for teaching comes through there<br>too um and you've he's had to do two two<br>things beyond the just basic research<br>one is to take that basic research and<br>help understand the implications of it<br>uh for the world for New Zealand now and<br>that means that you have to bring other<br>people in to help you understand what<br>the implications are and then<br>communicate that and we saw some<br>beautiful examples um both of how<br>Richard communicates with um uh you know<br>that the basketball Duncan<br>comparison really explaining um what the<br>implications are and why uh why it's<br>important and explaining those to Broad<br>groups um from the public also to<br>decision makers so that they can use the<br>insights from this work to help us<br>manage mitigate and adapt to the to the<br>Future that's<br>coming um one thing that may not have<br>come out as clearly as it should so it's<br>a great chance that I get to talk about<br>this is that um one of Richard's<br>superpowers is bringing together and<br>leading<br>teams um and I and I'm really in awe of<br>that<br>skill um last year I had the pleasure of<br>spending a couple of hours with Richard<br>and um some of the team just before they<br>were going down to the Antarctic to do<br>fieldwork for the ways Toc<br>project um over dinner I chatted with<br>Richard and one of his co-chief<br>scientists on the program Tina van vlat<br>about how they work<br>together um and through the course of<br>the conversation I came to see how<br>really critical teamwork is to the<br>success of the science that um um and I<br>thought I knew about teamwork because as<br>an as an engineer um we do a lot of work<br>in teams uh but I didn't have to share a<br>tent with my team um or spend 24 hours a<br>day 8 weeks in an isolated environment<br>so you know what I came to realize is<br>that a highly functioning team is<br>arguable arguably as important a<br>component of their scientific<br>methodology as a multi-million million<br>dollar drilling rig um it's not a nice<br>to have it's really essential and so the<br>kinds of skills that Richard has in<br>pulling those teams together very<br>diverse teams and making them work is<br>really exceptional<br>exceptional um and with there I I will<br>close this is a wonderful moment of<br>celebration for us and um a real<br>pleasure for me to offer this vote of<br>thanks today um in a minute we're going<br>to go into the hunter common room for<br>some refreshments but first I ask you<br>all to um join me in showing our<br>gratitude and celebrating Professor<br>Richard Levy</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
