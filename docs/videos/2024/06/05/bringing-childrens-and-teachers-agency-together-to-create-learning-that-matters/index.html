It draws from a larger study that examines how<br>early childhood educators re-design their pedagogy in<br>culturally responsive ways. In this presentation, Associate<br>Professor Jamie Sisson presents the findings of one team of<br>teachers who shifted their views about a group of children<br>impacted by forced migration who resisted planned learning<br>experiences.<br>The analysis focuses on how an assemblage of knowledge,<br>actors, expressions and experiences came together to<br>constitute children’s play and digital worlds as matter(ing) in<br>teachers’ planning and pedagogy and teachers’ planning and<br>pedagogy as matter(ing) in children’s play, demonstrating<br>how children and teachers re-imagined their repertoires,<br>identities and agencies to co-construct meaningful learning.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be

name is Oliva Kat and I'm senior<br>lecturer in division of education at<br>University of a at and also codirector<br>of years Research Center with my<br>colleague Melissa who you will meet<br>shortly are very pleased to host these<br>seminars uh and thank you so much for<br>coming before Melissa introduces our<br>speaker I should briefly share a couple<br>of housekeeping rules seminar will be<br>recorded uh please keep yourself mute<br>during the presentation and there will<br>be time to address questions and<br>comments uh after the presentation uh so<br>please type them in your chat box or you<br>can ask them personally after<br>presentation um I invite Melissa to<br>introduce our speak Melisa the floor is<br>yours thank you thank you Olivera and um<br>I'd like to reiterate Olivera's warm<br>welcome to everybody this afternoon um<br>thank you for joining us we are<br>delighted to have um as our speaker<br>today associate professor Jamie Sison<br>who is co- director of the center for<br>research in educational and social<br>inclusion and education Futures at the<br>University of South Australia she's also<br>co-founder of the culturally inclusive<br>Early Childhood pedagogies International<br>Network um Jam's research engages in<br>co-design research approaches with<br>partners with the aim of creating<br>educating communities where children<br>families and teachers can Thrive<br>together and she does this through two<br>research strands firstly research that<br>addresses the challenges that cause<br>early childhood teachers to lead the um<br>field and secondly through research that<br>addresses the need for culturally and<br>linguistically inclusive early childhood<br>education and practices um her<br>presentation today is sharing some of<br>her research um the presentation is<br>titled bringing children's and teachers<br>agency together to create learning that<br>matters it's my pleasure to welcome you<br>uh this afternoon Jamie and I will hand<br>over to<br>you thank you for that warm welcome and<br>introduction um I'd like to say hello to<br>everyone and thank you for having me at<br>the early Year's Research Center at WTO<br>um it was such an honor and privilege to<br>be invited to speak to you today and the<br>paper I'm going to talk to you about<br>today today is a published paper so I'll<br>have the link at the end of the<br>presentation and so I'll show that to<br>you then but this this paper is um let<br>me think if I can remember now is<br>published in the earli Years um are the<br>which one is it uh the international<br>Journal of Early Childhood so that's<br>where this paper is presented so I'll<br>tell you a little bit about the the<br>pilot project that this paper stems from<br>and then where that research is is going<br>before we begin I'd like to acknowledge<br>that the land in which This research was<br>conducted was the traditional land of<br>Ghana people and I'd like to pay my<br>respects to Ghana Elders past present in<br>those emerging um I'd also like to<br>acknowledge and pay my respects to the<br>king at Tonga and woto um toui is that<br>right people who I understand are the<br>traditional custodians of the wakata<br>region and I'd also like to pay my<br>respects to any other first nation's<br>people who might be with us today or<br>watching the recording in the<br>future so the reason for and and the<br>inspiration for This research is kind of<br>born out of a concern that for um many<br>many years in many different places<br>colonizing approaches to Early Childhood<br>pedagogy and education have positioned<br>First Nations people but also migrant<br>and Refugee children<br>as having deficits and it continues to<br>make their knowledge their ways of being<br>even their language invisible in early<br>childhood education settings so we<br>wanted to do something about this and<br>that's kind of why we started with this<br>research<br>project so the findings that I present<br>to you today derive from this pilot<br>project that um we were interested in<br>conducting with the Department of uh<br>education in South Australia and this<br>project was focused on bringing<br>culturally responsive pedagogies into<br>dialogue with the regia education<br>principles and the reason for this is<br>because there's many reasons but but one<br>was in 2013 in 2012 around that time we<br>had Carla Renaldi from Regio children<br>come and do a thinker in residency with<br>us so she spent lots of time in South<br>Australia and you know provided a report<br>of of advice of what she thinks we<br>should do to improve early childhood<br>education in South<br>Australia and at this time uh Professor<br>Irena rigny was also um asked to join<br>Regio children's um scientific committee<br>so he's one of the researchers on this<br>project so as you can imagine we have<br>lots of Early Childhood centers who um<br>self-identify as being inspired by the<br>education principle from regelia Italy<br>and so what we wanted to do was look at<br>how do the regia education principles um<br>help inform culturally responsive<br>pedagogies and how to culturally the key<br>ideas from culturally responsive<br>pedagogies help<br>inform um the princip the education<br>principles from reia so bringing kind of<br>these two different things into dialogue<br>and seeing what happens in teachers<br>practice now when we started with this<br>pilot project one of the things that<br>we've kept kind of hitting Us in the<br>face time and time again was that<br>teachers kept feeling and kept talking<br>about this increased pressure that they<br>had to prepare children for school and<br>that this increased pressure on you know<br>preparing children for a future life for<br>their school life um was often focused<br>on discourses around scientifically<br>proven curriculum in particularly<br>literacy focused and very<br>narrowly phonics focused and um that<br>might be something that seen some head<br>nods yes so we're experiencing that in<br>other places um but also this idea of w<br>Western Centric views of Child<br>Development about children developing in<br>a particular way in these linear<br>milestones and progressing children in<br>in this way so that was kind of the<br>dominant discourse that was circulating<br>and that teachers were feeling this<br>enormous amount of pressure and it was<br>um driving all of their<br>work so a common pedological struggle<br>that teachers that we were working with<br>kept talking about was um was engaging<br>children in these super diverse contexts<br>engaging very diverse children with<br>coming from um different language<br>language groups cultural groups um<br>getting them to engage actively in<br>planned interventions and activities<br>that the teachers were coming up that<br>were focused on you know these dominant<br>discourses of scientifically proven<br>curriculum because that's what they were<br>asked to do you know you've you've got<br>to lift your literacy um indicators we<br>want you to focus on Phonics but the<br>children aren't um participating in that<br>so that was a struggle that across the<br>board in all the centers that we were<br>working with that they were struggling<br>with is how do we engage children<br>because the children don't want to<br>engage in these things you know they're<br>running away from<br>us so that begs the question what does<br>scientifically proven curriculum even<br>matter if children are engaging with it<br>we can keep giving tools and resources<br>to teachers but if children are refusing<br>to engage with them then what does it<br>matter that was the question that we<br>were interested in and that was sort of<br>the question that I particularly was<br>interested in because I in my previous<br>life I Was An Early Childhood educator<br>in in the US and I left the field<br>because of that that push down I<br>remember in in the last year of my<br>teaching in the US um we were doing some<br>wonderful things with the children and a<br>lot of them um had gained a confidence<br>that they hadn't had before and then all<br>of a sudden we had a top- down policy<br>come in asking us to do a standardized<br>assessment which required us to scrap<br>all of our um our plans and everything<br>that we were doing with the children and<br>assess them oneon-one and just seeing<br>the impact it had on children who who<br>loved coming to preschool every day and<br>then not wanting to come at all uh it it<br>really impacted me which is why I went<br>into<br>research so I'm really inspired by the<br>work of Barbara comr and Barbara comr<br>talks about um turnaround pedagogies and<br>she warned that a preoccupation with a<br>delivery of information to Learners can<br>lead to what she call fickle literacies<br>and that's where practices of compliance<br>with teacher directed activities um have<br>this little connection with the<br>individual Learner in their life worlds<br>and it actually can serve can um serve<br>to further marginalize children so even<br>six years later so that was in 2017 now<br>fast forward to 2013 just last year comr<br>and Hayes argue that teacher listening<br>still is a practice that's under<br>researched and that listening really<br>matters in education and we're not we're<br>not researching it and we're not doing<br>enough of it so they call for research<br>on how teachers acquire repertoires that<br>interact with Learners to make learning<br>more<br>meaningful and so that was something<br>that I was really interested in this in<br>this project so we had the broader<br>project but that's kind of like where<br>down so as I mentioned before um working<br>with the um with with Regio children was<br>something that a lot of our sites were<br>interested in and many of them um were<br>self-identified as being what they<br>called Regio<br>inspired and so they had been previously<br>engaged in in a Regio educational<br>principles project that many of them had<br>been um partnershi in before so the case<br>study I'll share with you today<br>particularly connects with renaldi's<br>pedagogy of relationships and listening<br>and many of them in the project had<br>already this and engaged with this<br>reading and they in fact they they<br>quoted it often so a pedagogy of<br>listening is described as a search for<br>meeting where all parties involved<br>become knowledge<br>co-constructors and one of my favorite<br>quotes is this quote from Carla Renaldi<br>and she says our way of listening means<br>to be open to doubt and uncertainty this<br>listening means to be open to being in<br>crisis to accept<br>frustration it is not always bad to be<br>in in crisis she says because it means<br>that you are changing the problem is is<br>if you're not in crisis because it means<br>that you're not really listening to the<br>people around you to be open to others<br>means to have the courage to come into<br>this room and say I hope to be different<br>when I leave not necessarily because I<br>agree with you but because your thoughts<br>have made me think<br>differently and so that was something we<br>kept coming back to because they they<br>read it so often and we wanted to come<br>so we're also interested in Maul and<br>colleagues work because it helped<br>further shed light on why listening<br>matters and um and it matters because<br>children arrive with what they call Rich<br>funds of knowledge and funds of identity<br>that are important to who children<br>believe they are to how they connect<br>with the world around them how they<br>connect with the people around them and<br>how they understand and interact with<br>their world So within this larger<br>project we wanted to help teachers sort<br>of turn around their pedagogy to engage<br>with children's funds of knowledge and<br>funds of identities to redesign their<br>ways so Mo talks about funds of<br>knowledge as being these cultural bodies<br>of knowledge that are essential for<br>well-being of families and funds of<br>knowledge are important to the identity<br>of individual children in their of<br>belonging funds of knowledge become<br>funds of identity when people use them<br>to Define themselves and who they are so<br>they include funds of knowledge beyond<br>the household and can include other<br>parts of their Liv so such as if a child<br>is involved in a sport or um or dance or<br>another friendship group or an<br>interest so funds of identity are<br>inscribed into artifacts and they're<br>transported across different contexts in<br>one's life so we can actually draw on<br>these funds of identities um to<br>learning so we wanted to explore how the<br>Early Childhood teachers in this project<br>turned around their pedagogy in practice<br>to co-construct meaningful learning with<br>children in culturally responsive ways<br>so we used what we called a nested<br>approach to do this and so what that did<br>was we wanted to focus on um giving<br>teachers agency to agency over their<br>their professional learning so we<br>engaged them in critical action research<br>so their job was to think of a<br>pedological challenge and to conduct<br>critical action research on this<br>challenge so that they can try some new<br>pedagogies informed by the theories that<br>we're talking about in in this<br>professional learning community that<br>sort of sat around that to support<br>them and so in the professional learning<br>communities we sort of walked the<br>teachers through this um through these<br>methods for critical action research and<br>supported them in thinking about you<br>know how do they develop their question<br>how they might research it in a way that<br>it wasn't separate and extra to their<br>work but in a way where it could be<br>embedded in their everyday practice<br>because another thing is we didn't want<br>to overload teachers with something that<br>was seen as an add-on but that's<br>something that could be seen as<br>important part of all of of their work<br>all the<br>time so in these professional learning<br>communities we also talked about the key<br>ideas from cultur responsive pedagogies<br>and the education principles from reia<br>which they were all familiar with so a<br>lot of times we would put these things<br>side by side and talk about how they<br>might speak to each other and how they<br>work<br>together and then what sat around all of<br>that um was the research that we were<br>doing as um as a research team which was<br>looking at the experiences of the um<br>teacher<br>researchers and um looking at how they<br>experienced being together in this<br>professional Learning Community how how<br>that brought together an assemblage um<br>in a way that informed their pedagogy in<br>different ways and then look at how they<br>spoke about uh the impact on children<br>practice so today I'll share with you<br>just one case study and we'll call them<br>Gumtree Early Learning Center so Gumtree<br>um sat within a council area that was<br>referred to as a refugee welcome<br>Zone and so there were 94 children sorry<br>that's my dog you hear the little<br>tapping of the toes um so there are 94<br>children enrolled in this preschool and<br>there were two sessions so children come<br>to preschool for two and a half days<br>that's that's um what they have access<br>to and so with each of these sessions<br>there was 46 children in one session and<br>48 in another<br>session and within each of these<br>sessions there were over 20 different<br>cultural groups represented an 11 and 12<br>language groups that were other than<br>English so this is what we call you know<br>super diversity right many and then the<br>site identified that many of the<br>children had complex needs and were<br>coming from trauma backgrounds and some<br>of them had complex needs that were<br>so the pedological challenge at gum<br>tree um each time that we met and we met<br>um we met twice every term for the whole<br>year and every time that gum tree came<br>their pedological um challenge was sort<br>of focused around this group of children<br>that they lovingly called the runners so<br>the runners were a group of 20 to 25<br>children depending on the day who would<br>spend a large portion of their<br>Collective time you know just<br>collectively running just rampid running<br>and this phenomenon had been occurring<br>every day since the start of the year so<br>that was two months before the project<br>began<br>imagine just running so the director<br>Christie said the children spend their<br>whole day just lapping the yard like a<br>conga line one starts and they would all<br>just join in the line the teacher<br>Rebecca said we had a large group of<br>children running and in term two it<br>wasn't really settling it's normal for<br>children to run she said at the<br>beginning of the year but we realized<br>they were just run and run and run and<br>no matter what we did to try and support<br>them it just kept happening so they<br>couldn't stop it it just kept<br>going so if you can imagine when they<br>when they came to our sessions they were<br>just feeling like<br>H what are we going to do you know<br>they're they're not participating in our<br>learning<br>experiences so another challenge that<br>sort of surfaced as we were discussing<br>more was that there was a challenge with<br>this loud discourse of School<br>Readiness and the leader Christie said<br>at the moment the last couple of years<br>there's been a big push with being a<br>worldclass system within 10 years the<br>big push is on literacy particularly<br>reading it's kind of like everything<br>else has fallen to the<br>Wayside she said you've got education<br>directors who are our line managers and<br>they're saying to them we've done enough<br>well-being all right let's push past the<br>well-being now you need to focus on the<br>big push which is literacy and nap plan<br>data and you've got to be a part of this<br>so what they had were um um these sort<br>of um District district groups where<br>preschools would um interact with the<br>feeder schools and so get everybody on<br>board with the same goal and that was<br>increase literacy and nap plan data<br>which is the standardized<br>assessment and she said some of these<br>kids aren't even turning five yet and<br>many of them were just new arrivals I'll<br>remind<br>you so for this analysis you know<br>thinking about what was happening at<br>this site I kept thinking about some of<br>the reading that I was doing with um<br>Delo and gari and Bard's work and I kept<br>coming back to these ideas is about<br>assemblages and um Delo and kari's<br>notion of assemblage for thinking about<br>how knowledge actors expressions and<br>experiences intraa to constitute what<br>matters to teachers that was something<br>that I was really interested in doing<br>and then you know and the other part of<br>that is how do they interact and what<br>consider what matters for children so<br>Delo and gari positioned positioning of<br>pedological choices they do they talk<br>about the them in terms of two lines is<br>constantly interfering um reacting upon<br>each other introducing into each other<br>either this current of suppleness or a<br>point of<br>rigidity so this was useful in this<br>analysis in particular I was interested<br>in exploring how the teachers<br>interactions with the assemblages<br>informed how they inform their decisions<br>about planning and whether that was<br>rigid or Supple so if you think about<br>the things that they came into the<br>project with and how that was informing<br>their planning and then thinking about<br>what we were doing in our professional<br>Learning Community creating assemblages<br>of new readings and new interactions and<br>then what that did for their<br>planning so I also found barad's notion<br>of returning really helpful in going<br>Beyond reflecting so barard talks about<br>a process of turning it over and over<br>again so um uh interacting diffracting<br>diffracting and new and the making of<br>new temporality and and SpaceTime<br>mattering so um in particular I was<br>interested in exploring how teachers<br>return their observations of the<br>children because they what they came<br>into the professional learning<br>communities talking about and how they<br>spoke about the children um did have<br>that deficit lens you know talking about<br>children in a certain way about what<br>they can't do the children don't have<br>attention spans they um can't<br>communicate they they don't have a<br>shared language you know these were it<br>was all of that sort of deficit point of<br>point so for the teachers at Gumtree<br>this loud discourse of Readiness and<br>then using this kind of theoretical<br>framework um it was<br>predominantly this I guess the um<br>assemblage was sort of informed by this<br>loud discourse of School Readiness where<br>the the knowledge um was this academic<br>focused on literacy and in particular<br>plan scores and what that looked like<br>the actors such as line managers you<br>know were people who held the power that<br>told them what they could do and what<br>you know what they shouldn't be doing<br>but what they should be focused on so<br>you know that sort of points teachers in<br>the direction and puts that pressure on<br>well you need to be looking at this now<br>and then the Expressions that were used<br>expressions like we've done enough<br>well-being now we need to move on to<br>something<br>else and then their experiences which<br>were limiting of what the teachers could<br>do so all of these things um were<br>interactions in an assemblage that led<br>the teachers to ask this question and<br>this was the question that they wanted<br>to ask for their critical action<br>research how can we stop the running and<br>get the children to engage in the<br>planning experiences to improve literacy<br>so that was their beginning question<br>together so this dominant discourse LED<br>the teachers to have this first reading<br>of the running phenomenon so when we<br>talked about it um the first reading was<br>Guided by their attention to literacy<br>requirements for School Readiness and<br>children's developmental goals so this<br>centered on the teams focused on trying<br>to limit and deter the children from<br>running this sort of the power stuff of<br>controlling and at times to lure them<br>into planned activities and experiences<br>designed to meet Developmental and<br>learning goals so drawing on their<br>knowledge of child development the<br>teachers would describe children's<br>running as a physical<br>need as an issue with children's<br>attention span and as issues with the<br>physical environment so these readings<br>um along with the pressure to produce<br>you know particular outcomes for<br>literacy um they LED teachers to offer<br>these rigid interventions where this is<br>what we're doing now and we have to do<br>it now and I need to tick off that all<br>of these children have participated in<br>this but they just couldn't get the<br>children to do it because this is what<br>the children<br>doing so the children were collectively<br>responding to these rigid activities<br>with inactions of their own a gentle<br>Cuts as barard would say so in other<br>words they collectively resisted and<br>continued with the running time and time<br>time again which rendered teachers plans<br>unsuccessful in achieving the final<br>outcome so what was happening was at<br>times teachers were okay so um you know<br>we're looking at kind of controlling<br>this Behavior if they want to run on<br>then it must be an environment problem<br>so let's change the way we've organized<br>the room and so what they did is they<br>created barriers all through the room um<br>you know to kind of stop the running and<br>then outside as well but what happened<br>was is that became part of the<br>game it was an obstacle course now and<br>they were still running and doing things<br>um okay well it's not the environment so<br>um I know it's a physical need they need<br>to run so let's take them up to The Big<br>Field and give them a designated time of<br>day where they can just run as much as<br>they want and they can do whatever they<br>want and then we'll bring them back and<br>it' be time to sit and listen and do the<br>planned activities but that didn't work<br>as well it didn't they they did the<br>running there and they came back and<br>they still did more running it just<br>didn't stop um and then and then the<br>last strategy that they tried you know<br>with this sort of thinking was all right<br>well maybe they don't know how to play<br>so let's capture them individually and<br>we'll sit with them and we'll do some<br>one-on-one modeling on how to play and<br>how to interact in these these learning<br>activities but these kids I'm telling<br>you they're just so brilliant you'd get<br>them oneon-one and another one would<br>come and tap on the shoulder and as soon<br>as the teacher and this is the teacher<br>telling us this as soon as she would<br>turn around she would come back and that<br>one was gone so it didn't work either<br>they were really clever at this it was<br>it was amazing to hear about and to<br>watch the video videos because they<br>videoed all of this to sort of study<br>on so as part of the teachers<br>interactions during our project in the<br>professional Learning Community meetings<br>we engaged in reading and rereading of<br>the pedagogy of listening again what<br>does it really mean to listen and have<br>that relationship you know are we really<br>listening like we say we are um and we<br>also introduce them to Ma and colleagues<br>work around funds of knowledge and funds<br>of identity so these new interactions<br>provided an opportunity for teachers to<br>return and return to the running<br>Phenomenon with a new focus a focus on<br>listening to learn about the children<br>rather than listening to assess where<br>they are so you see how these new<br>interactions um you know were offering<br>something new and different so after<br>they engaged in these interactions the<br>teachers actually changed their research<br>question to these questions their first<br>question was well what's driving the<br>children to run so that's a completely<br>different question than<br>before it's a question that's curious to<br>what's going on for the children what's<br>driving the running and then the second<br>question is how can we connect with<br>children's funds of knowledge and funds<br>of identity to make learning more<br>meaningful a complete shift in their<br>research question from controlling<br>children to in you know engaging with<br>so the refocusing of teachers attention<br>for meeting literacy outcomes to<br>exploring children's funds of identity<br>and funds of knowledge positioned<br>children as the experts of their own<br>experiences from which CH the teachers<br>wanted to learn more so the teachers<br>actually turned around and they did<br>things differently so instead of just<br>trying to stop it they observed it and<br>they studied it they talked to the<br>families and asked families no this is<br>going on do they do that at home and you<br>know trying to you know get some more<br>perspectives and understand what was<br>going on but it wasn't until one one day<br>at one of the meetings I said you know<br>maybe maybe talk to the children maybe<br>show the video and and you have to<br>realize there were some language<br>barriers so there wasn't a lot of<br>language happening um but I said maybe<br>if you show show the video and if you<br>can you know have them watch it and see<br>if they have a way of explaining you<br>know expressing to you what's going on<br>maybe that will give you some insights<br>and that's exactly what happened so<br>Rebecca said um I interviewed one of one<br>child and he was watching the video of<br>of everyone running and he says oh I'm<br>playing hello<br>neighbor and then she asked well what's<br>that I've never heard of that and he's<br>like oh it's a game and then he ran off<br>and that was it that's all she got but<br>she's like oh I've got something now you<br>know um so they went and they looked up<br>hello neighbor and it is uh an online<br>game it's a video game and so she came<br>back to the other teachers and saidyou<br>never going to believe it but you know<br>look what this child said it's hello<br>neighbors so they went on and they<br>looked up the game and sure enough it<br>was a popular game and when they talked<br>to the families about it sure enough the<br>pieces started falling together and that<br>was one of the games but there were many<br>other games that the children were<br>playing too that it wasn't part of the<br>teachers knowledge base so they weren't<br>plugging into that so they weren't<br>understanding that the running actually<br>so rather than focusing on children's<br>minimal engagement with interventions<br>and activities as being an issue with<br>children having a short attention span<br>the teachers started to shift their<br>focus to see actually the children were<br>participating in this running for such<br>long periods of time that happen now up<br>in in term three like three terms of<br>doing the same game actually showed them<br>that children had a capacity for a long<br>attention span when what they were doing<br>actually mattered to them and connected<br>with their funds of identities and so<br>that was like boom the light Bob moment<br>that that came for the teachers so then<br>they started to see that children<br>actually had these amazing relationships<br>with each other even children that<br>didn't have a shared language they<br>created a shared language in this game<br>some of the children had never even<br>played these games before but they found<br>a way to communicate to collectively<br>design something together that that<br>meant something to all of them it just<br>didn't mean something to the teachers<br>but once the teacher turned around to it<br>um she was able to engage with them and<br>well so this strength-based rereading of<br>the runners LED teachers to make more<br>Supple pedagogical choices so in turning<br>to their life worlds the teacher started<br>showing interest in what the children<br>were interested in started um suspending<br>judgments about children's dig lives<br>because in the beginning they thought oh<br>no there's a digital games we don't want<br>to go there um but then after they<br>started talking about it it it is a part<br>of children's lives and if we you know<br>create that as separate because it's not<br>part of our lives and we disagree with<br>it then how are we um connecting with<br>their life worlds so let's find ways<br>that we can connect with their life<br>worlds in a meaningful way but also help<br>children um be critical consumers of<br>what they're they're engaging with<br>online<br>and then um and then they started<br>engaging the children in co-designing<br>learning experiences and building their<br>repertoire so pairing some of the<br>runners with some of the children who<br>weren't engaging in the running to<br>design new learning experiences that<br>were meaningful to everyone so for<br>instance um one of the running scenarios<br>um they picked up that it because they<br>were knocking stuff down this is one of<br>the more destructive ones they were just<br>running through and throwing things and<br>knocking things down and then they found<br>that that was about Angry Birds they<br>were reenacting Angry Birds so instead<br>what they did was channeled it with a<br>group of children in the block area to<br>say you know we've got these these kids<br>are really good at using these blocks so<br>can we combine these ideas together and<br>create um a a a game of Angry Birds with<br>some of the block materials and so they<br>were able to do that and that lasted for<br>um so the interesting thing that you<br>know I've learned from this this part of<br>the research was that limiting teachers<br>agency limits children's agency and so<br>if we're not giving teachers agency then<br>how do we expect them to create<br>opportunities for children to be active<br>agents in their own learning and I think<br>that's something really powerful<br>particularly now in in thinking about<br>what's happening around Behavioral<br>Management and control and packaged<br>curriculums and that something that we<br>really need to think about and for me it<br>really highlighted the importance of the<br>intellectual work of Early Childhood<br>teachers and how this requires<br>opportunity to engage in assemblages of<br>interactions with alternative<br>narratives you know thinking of things<br>Beyond what's useful it also um<br>signified the importance of professional<br>learning communities and action research<br>and having that opportunity to return<br>observations over and over again not<br>just to analyze them once through<br>through one lens but but to go back to<br>them again and think think through<br>Theory think about them in another way<br>engage with different<br>perspectives and then finally the<br>importance of connecting with children's<br>funds of knowledge and identities and<br>how that is important to creating<br>meaningful learning and experiences that<br>children and as promised There's the<br>you want to take a screenshot of that<br>but I can share that um with you<br>afterwards and that's all I have about<br>that if um you have any questions or I'm<br>now thank you so much Jamie that was so<br>interesting and um screenshot of the<br>paper would be great for anyone who<br>wants to take that or um feel free to<br>pop it in the chat if you can cut and<br>um so many wonderful things that you<br>shared and so interesting I was also<br>admiring their Fitness and running<br>running all day as well um Oliva did you<br>want to or questions I'll let you<br>facilitate this part if you like<br>Oliva uh I'm just wondering maybe we<br>start with some questions and then um<br>because I I I don't see any in the chat<br>so we can actually go um in any<br>direction we really want and ask<br>anything we are interested and uh while<br>we are maybe waiting to people uh like<br>for people to jump in I just want to<br>actually kind of make couple of points<br>it's really fascinating how uh policies<br>and that kind of focus on their restrict<br>curriculum shapes and constructs what<br>you believe literacy is about so it was<br>really fascinating by that kind of<br>because I'm in policy space and I just<br>think actually how even understanding<br>what literacy is is pretty much embedded<br>in that kind of context where you are<br>and I was really also interested because<br>they said at the beginning they are<br>following reg media program so I was uh<br>maybe uh I I wonder I wondered actually<br>um uh what are your observations of that<br>understanding of literacy Jamie and and<br>in terms of like relationality and stuff<br>like that given that it is kind of core<br>in of over like relational pedagogy but<br>at the same time it seems to me that uh<br>the teachers's understanding and the way<br>how they practice literacy was not that<br>relational if you if you know what I<br>mean so I'm just kind of asking for some<br>comments or maybe some further U<br>insights from the research yeah it's<br>really interesting because I mean if you<br>look at the um EF the early Year's<br>learning framework um it's not focused<br>on a narrow view of literacy it it<br>actually isn't so I I I like you I find<br>it really fascinating um that when I go<br>out more and more I I see that teachers<br>are feeling a pressure so if it's not<br>coming from the um the policy the early<br>years learning framework you know where<br>is it coming from and I think it's<br>coming from that push down um of<br>curriculum because there's you know as<br>we as we get higher up in in primary<br>school there is a lot of pressure to<br>have higher scores in that plan and so I<br>I guess the thinking is um with with the<br>feeder schools and working together that<br>if you're preparing children for school<br>or if they're coming up then we want you<br>know they want to see that they come<br>already with some skills so that they<br>can hit the ground running but what<br>we're finding is is that it actually<br>isn't working very well because like<br>this project shows there's some<br>resistance to it um but also what we<br>know in early childhood is pre- literacy<br>skills are important which require a lot<br>of play base learning doesn't it so it<br>goes beyond just sitting down and<br>learning phonics but you know literacy<br>involves a a lot of other things<br>interaction storytelling things like<br>that and um and so it's it's not<br>necessarily something that's coming from<br>um the national curriculum or national<br>early Years Learning framework but it's<br>coming from other pressures otherwhere<br>other places that you know are sort of<br>this dominant discourse that keeps<br>permeating through to early childhood<br>and I think that was the important thing<br>is having you they were feeling this<br>pressure of oh we've got to increase<br>these scores and you know if if our<br>children aren't doing this by you know<br>the end of the year before they go to to<br>school then it's not going to look good<br>on us and my point to them was but the<br>children aren't in doing it now with<br>what you're doing they're not engaging<br>with it so you're not going to have them<br>to that point so let's just let's look<br>at it differently and to have a really<br>supportive Early Childhood director who<br>is in that setting to say yep I agree<br>it's not working let's try something new<br>they actually were able to get the<br>children involved in other activities<br>and actually make some more gains and<br>and learning their home language um<br>literacy is bigger than just English<br>language it's you know learning home<br>language it's making those connections<br>and I don't know if you're aware of<br>Jackie dte's work but you know she talks<br>a lot about that of language math and<br>looking at um the language of of<br>families and bringing that into the<br>classroom so and this what I shared to<br>you today was a a pilot project so now<br>we've gone on to um a a funded project<br>through the Lilian Delissa trust and in<br>that project we're looking at culturally<br>and linguistically responsive pedagogies<br>because there was such a literacy Focus<br>um in in the um pilot project which was<br>more on culturally responsive and the<br>principles for regelia um this one we<br>focused on culturally and linguistically<br>because that was coming through as being<br>being important so in that project um<br>I'll show you the slide for that in in<br>that project in the first year what we<br>are focusing on is um in the first year<br>it was culturally and linguistically<br>responsive engagement with families so<br>that way we get families involved in<br>Sharing home language in um to come in<br>and and to help create for instance<br>bilingual books um because what we found<br>is a lot of sites didn't have um access<br>to bilingual books but many children we<br>were doing a little bit of a book audit<br>and um there are lots of children who<br>don't see themselves in the picture<br>books that are on offer and don't see<br>their language represented and you know<br>that's that's really sad um so we wanted<br>to have a little bit of change to that<br>so parents are coming in now in Reading<br>with the teacher reading in home<br>language and you know just seeing how<br>that turns around and and just the light<br>in as the teacher says just seeing<br>children's eyes light up when they hear<br>maybe not even their home language but<br>they hear an another language that's<br>different than English has really had an<br>impact to how children feel that they<br>belong in that<br>space that was probably really<br>long-winded answer to very short that's<br>actually very good to know because the<br>the one of things that I was also<br>interested is actually uh you do see any<br>progress and any kind of change in terms<br>of teachers understanding of literacy<br>given that this was pilot and now you<br>work with them for some time it was<br>great answer so just leave a space for<br>some other people to engage or maybe<br>comment with their questions and<br>and thanks here Jamie when just really a<br>question from something you just said<br>now<br>um um some of the work uh around what<br>I've often encountered in New Zealand<br>Early Childhood centers is from migrant<br>families a real desire for their child<br>to learn<br>English not in a bad way but perhaps not<br>understanding that it's not one or the<br>other right you can certainly um learn<br>English but also retain home languages<br>do you do you find the same thing in<br>your work with<br>um you know um bilingual books for<br>example um feeling that they need to<br>discard some of that in favor of English<br>yeah absolutely we are finding that and<br>um and you know so the approach is to<br>get into more dialogue to engage with<br>families and oh look I know you really<br>want to to to learn English but we also<br>want to learn your language because<br>children learn English better when it's<br>in context with their home language um<br>so helping you know parents understand<br>that but one of one of the um the sites<br>well actually two two of the sites that<br>we're working with now um one of the<br>things that they decided to do was to<br>start learning the languages of the<br>children and just the simple thing of<br>taking the small step of trying to learn<br>the the greeting of a child's home<br>language for when the family brings them<br>and to say the Lang the language you<br>know the the greeting um and then the<br>parents look and go did you just speak<br>my<br>language and they're like I tried and<br>and you know everyone has a big laugh<br>because maybe they said something wrong<br>or they mispronounced it and then it<br>what it did was it it really lowered one<br>of the things that we're talking about<br>this year is lowering atmospheric walls<br>and that was inspired by the work of<br>Sarah ammed she talks about you know um<br>in in zalis um Melina zalis they talk<br>about effective<br>atmospheres and um that we have these<br>atmospheric walls that are in place that<br>stop you know people from feeling like<br>they long or stop them from entering or<br>stop them from interacting and so what<br>we notice as parents were saying um you<br>know school is separate I don't want to<br>push in because you know it might be a<br>cultural thing or I don't want to seem<br>pushy I don't want to seem like I'm my<br>own agenda so parents were feeling<br>actually really worried about you know<br>coming in and speaking and saying things<br>because they they felt self-conscious<br>and and oftentimes they were<br>apologizing for the fact that their<br>child um didn't have a lot of English<br>and um so what our teachers are doing is<br>is saying oh no need to apologize at all<br>I think it's wonderful and I can't wait<br>to learn some of you know your language<br>as well and the other children are<br>looking forward to learning about your<br>language and so it really helped to<br>lower these walls and we what we've<br>noticed is that parents are interacting<br>more and they're wanting to come in and<br>be a part of it because now they see it<br>as a safe<br>place yeah um thank you so much it's um<br>interesting uh some of the work with<br>families around this as well and that<br>apprehension and Atmospheric walls is an<br>interesting way to describe it um you<br>know feeling like they either you know<br>they're not a teacher so what could they<br>possibly do I I hear that a lot as well<br>in some of the work with families which<br>is nice to have those conversations and<br>hopefully break down some of those WS<br>actually you can do a lot you don't have<br>to be a trained you know early childhood<br>teacher to um Foster Children's Learning<br>so thank<br>you others<br>I'm not sure if others want to jump in<br>comment I just wanted to acknowledge how<br>fascinating it was Jamie um I've done um<br>my research area around student voice<br>and how that interacts with teacher um<br>practice as well and that whole idea<br>that uh teachers are<br>autonomous um can kind of be quite<br>dangerous too so it's that whole<br>entanglement of teachers and discourse<br>and pressure and where teachers<br>um because I'm not early child primary<br>that whole idea around uh the spaces<br>that they'll create um for children and<br>voice and bringing um agency together is<br>is really interesting to me so thank you<br>um and I'm trying to work with um<br>effective atmospheres at the moment too<br>so it's interesting to have somebody<br>mentioned that to yeah yes so thank you<br>very much good I'd love to hear about<br>your work I'm really really we we got<br>into um zal's work we had him actually<br>come visit and he he worked with us so<br>it was just amazing for Melina zalis to<br>come to our professional learning<br>community meeting to have the teachers<br>actually present their action research<br>on lowering atmospheric walls with<br>family so they they presented what they<br>did their their critical action research<br>projects and um you know they're as<br>they're presenting they're saying and<br>michelino simbala said who's sitting in<br>front of me and they're quoting him in<br>in their presentations it was it was<br>really humbling experience but um it was<br>good to see to have him there and to<br>give us advice and for the teachers to<br>see that what they were doing really did<br>matter not not just to the families but<br>that other people were excited to see<br>about what they were doing and were<br>learning from it<br>I would love to hear<br>about hopefully we G outlive the uh the<br>current um discourse around pre<br>prepackage curriculum and preparedness<br>and for some kind of future hopefully<br>we'll get Beyond it again hopefully<br>hopefully have to keep resisting or keep<br>you know I think it's showing examples<br>of good practice you know I think we I<br>think we need more examples like this we<br>need to make these examples visible like<br>this is what's possible and the fact<br>that it just really turned around not<br>only were the children you know scoring<br>better and in the literacy indicators<br>but they actually loved coming to their<br>preschool they loved being there and<br>they felt like you know the families<br>could see it and it just really changed<br>the whole feeling of it the<br>atmosphere you've got that eded um<br>respect for children in early childhood<br>as well that the the children chose to<br>engage whereas I was thinking about<br>translating that across into a primary<br>classroom where there would not be the<br>other opportunities they would not be<br>able to run because if they did they<br>would be considered a runner in a<br>different sense you know that they'd<br>taken off or that they were disruptive<br>so that whole embedded um the children<br>chose not to engage as a as a meaningful<br>thing that even in in itself that's it's<br>quite a lovely discourse to have um<br>intention with the official discourses<br>as well coming<br>down yes so<br>Emily thank you Jamie for such amazing<br>presentation I'm really impressed by the<br>research you have done and you're going<br>to do um I'm currently am um studying as<br>a PhD students as I'm still on my<br>proposal stage um in ECE and my research<br>um focus is in uh assessment for<br>learning in ECE space from the teachers<br>perspective so my question for you would<br>be um how you think um the assessment s<br>in the pedagogy and your research and<br>and and also as you mentioned at the<br>beginning your of your presentation the<br>changes in the US the suddenly changes<br>to the um summative assessment and the<br>children's engagements get get uh<br>reduced um but in this scenario you give<br>them more choices more um followed to<br>more more power to Children than how<br>from teachers perspect perspective how<br>you think or where you think the<br>assessment can fit in there and what<br>type of assessment can fit in there yeah<br>it's a really good question and um you<br>know I think when I was a teacher I<br>definitely didn't have any agency<br>because um and I didn't tell you this<br>part of the story I I did have agency<br>but then my agency was taken from me so<br>um we had the standardized assessment<br>and I saw what it was doing to the<br>children so I actually resisted and I<br>stopped doing it um and at the end of<br>the year you know the question was well<br>where are your scores and I said well I<br>don't have any because in my my comment<br>was I don't believe in child abuse and<br>that that was my comment and you know<br>said aha very funny we agree with you<br>but we need to do this to to get our fun<br>fing so it's important that you do it<br>and um I I couldn't see it took up so<br>much of the day it there was no pedagogy<br>so in that sense when we were doing that<br>assessment it it took so many weeks<br>because the teacher had to sit<br>individually with every single child you<br>know there was no other engagement that<br>I could have with them in a meaningful<br>pedagogy so it it took away everything<br>that I could do with them um so that's<br>you know on one extreme and I believe<br>they've moved away from that now<br>um you know but what we have in South<br>Australia is um we talk about having um<br>a cycle of assessment informing and so<br>assessment not in the terms of sitting<br>down um doing flashcards assessment or<br>you know written assessment it's more<br>about observation about observing<br>children so in the sense of the runners<br>they were you know when we started<br>Shifting the way they thought about<br>assessment it was more about observing<br>to see what the children we're doing and<br>understanding it from A New Perspective<br>so instead of separating and saying okay<br>they don't have language because they<br>can't do language in this narrow context<br>which is you know this context that I've<br>designed because they can't sit still<br>and they're not engaging with me they<br>don't have language and they don't have<br>attention span so broadening up um the<br>assessment to see let's look at<br>Children's everyday experiences and<br>where can you see evidence of long<br>attention spans and you know engaging in<br>communication in different ways so then<br>you know once they kind of Switched<br>their thinking from assessment needing<br>to happen at a certain time and place to<br>seeing it happen um in context they<br>could actually see children having<br>higher capacities than they were able to<br>see before so I think um you know back<br>to your question where does assessment<br>play in is I think assessment plays um<br>kind of in a in a<br>in the entanglement assessment's part of<br>the entanglement because it's part of<br>what you're constantly doing um informed<br>by other things that you're listening to<br>and the and the pressures that you have<br>and and what you're reading and what you<br>bring to it you know determines where<br>you see assessment happening but um in<br>many ways you know teachers who I see um<br>that<br>are really engaging meaningful with<br>children they're able to create that<br>cycle all the way through everything<br>that they're doing they're always<br>looking for opportunities of seeing<br>Children's Learning in in<br>anything is that what you're finding<br>what what are you<br>finding um very similar I think uh as<br>more have the um the the is more about<br>the power shifting between the teachers<br>and the children and sometimes we give<br>the children more choices and follow<br>their interest and sometimes way we can<br>um facilitate that interest and we can<br>guide that interest towards more<br>learning and from you um you just<br>described so more observation from the<br>teachers and just give the um like from<br>the back from the background and and<br>follow the pattern follow the trajection<br>of children's interest and then we can<br>get a better idea from from the children<br>how they can we can foster their<br>learning so mainly it's about<br>what sit at the background how the<br>teachers can do when we look at in in in<br>scenarios so it goes I think it connects<br>too real really nicely with what Emily<br>was saying too it's you know relational<br>and so when when we're when we're moving<br>and following the children and seeing<br>what they can do in those context we're<br>develop developing that trust in that<br>relationship so that then maybe later<br>when you know there comes to a time<br>where we need to sit and do assessment<br>in a particular context because there's<br>been this relationship that's been built<br>um you know then then they're more able<br>to uh be successful in that scenario as<br>well yeah hopefully AG<br>you thank you so much BR just sent a<br>message that she needs to leave and I<br>think actually we are a bit actually uh<br>any the time so I will just close us<br>with another kakia but before I do that<br>thank you so much Jamie it was amazing<br>and so many actually questions uh one of<br>them we are not talking about now but<br>I'm just thinking about also teachers<br>and their understanding of their<br>cultures and their identities as you<br>kind of said something like um teachers<br>agency if it is limited it limits<br>children a agency so that even<br>understanding or maybe assumptions that<br>we can share our cultures might to all<br>other kind of uh limitations that you<br>just spoke about but uh anyway thank you<br>so much it was amazing to have you with<br>us uh I will close this with kakia and I<br>want to thank you all for coming today M<br>M M<br>M thank you so much for coming and we<br>will see you soon in some other seminar<br>probably later this year thank you you<br>thanks thank thank you nice you all it</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
