Plants,<br>lichen and mushrooms provide the air we breathe, the food we<br>eat, pleasures we crave, medicines, and shelter. They also<br>have the power to poison us or kill us by other means. When<br>faced with this familiar-strange intelligence, human arrogance<br>assumes that humans have the deciding power. Human-Plant<br>Studies (HPS) questions this assumption, as do indigenous<br>ways of understanding the living world. This presentation<br>endeavors to open up a richer understanding of human-plant<br>relations, using storying as a means of reimagining human<br>relations with the vegetal world.<br>Childrenâ€™s literature, typically expresses adult desires, hopes,<br>and concerns about the future, and so often provides fertile<br>ground for imagining new ways of being in the world. In this<br>presentation, I am interested in whether young readers of the<br>books I discuss would be able to imagine human-plant<br>relations in the ways I describe. I use them to tap into collective<br>ideas about plants to (re)imagine relations with the vegetal<br>world. Three cases will be presented: 1. Losing contact<br>2. Becoming compost 3. Becoming native.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Lydia um is going to talk to us today<br>about uh storing engagements with<br>vegetal intelligences Insight from music<br>from children's literature and Lydia has<br>had a vared research career her research<br>interests focus on how narrative<br>engagement Fosters thoughtful and<br>critical thinking and she's examined<br>this theme in relation to L2 reading<br>Holocaust studies sexuality and most<br>recently understanding plant<br>intelligence so this presentation is<br>from her latest research focus and um<br>we're thrilled to have you here Lydia<br>hoping that you might be visiting us<br>later in the year as well which is<br>fantastic um and maybe being part of the<br>at class conference um being hosted at<br>the University of w Castle so uh without<br>further Ado I'll hand over to you I'll<br>remind people that we've got about 45 to<br>50 minutes of talking and then there are<br>a few enough of us here for you to be<br>able to ask any questions that you'd<br>like in person at the end um and just a<br>reminder to put yourself on mute during<br>the um the talk and I'll hand over to<br>you liia oh well thank so much I'm<br>really excited about being able to be<br>here and be part of this this event and<br>and to get to know you all and because<br>we're a small group it means that<br>there'll be even better discussions and<br>so on so I thought I'd start by kind of<br>not assuming that you know where Olo is<br>so here is Olo in Finland so to get you<br>kind of oriented to where I am in the<br>world and that does become a little bit<br>relevant in relationship to the second<br>case study that I look at which is um<br>set in the Border countries um it's<br>become a bit sort of trendy in the world<br>to kind of acknowledge whose land you<br>occupy but Olo is<br>actually not part of the area of the<br>indigenous peoples of the northe army uh<br>and the second story that I look at<br>includes Sami a Sami character or party<br>Sami character<br>um the area that's uh marked separately<br>on the left hand side is the area<br>Finnish uh stap me you probably know it<br>by the name laand um but s me is it is<br>its proper name um and that area extends<br>into Sweden and into Norway and into<br>parts of Russia as well Ola was is a<br>trading area but today it's actually<br>home to between 40 to 50% of the Sonic<br>population of wom um for various cult<br>reasons but allo itself was is um was<br>the first major inhabitants of the area<br>were were<br>fins uh so Nicol and I have organized<br>that Nicola is going to run a very small<br>uh little um quiz for you now uh and my<br>first question is I'm going to show you<br>the cover of my uh wife's cousin's uh<br>book and so he's he's a nature<br>photographer and the question is simply<br>what do you see so what is the first<br>thing that you pay attention to in the<br>image I'm about to show you now so I'll<br>show you the image and then Nicha will<br>give us the the little um interactive<br>thing so you can press your button and<br>say what it is that you saw so the first<br>thing your your eyes is drawn to here we<br>go and nichas we could have our little<br>toll<br>results there we go right okay you've<br>been primed because of the title to<br>think about the plants to actually look<br>at the to so I am very impressed that<br>most of you three of you or 30% uh saw<br>the liting that's actually fairly<br>unusual what you're drawn to is the<br>color um because of the brightness of<br>the color and so on but typically what<br>happens is that more people will see a<br>bird um and they will particularly<br>notice the bird on the left hand side<br>due to our pred predilection for<br>noticing um moving objects and that bird<br>is in movement so our ey is often drawn<br>to that it's on the side of the familiar<br>but the orange the bright orange is also<br>a color associated with danger and<br>something trepidation and so on so our<br>eyes are also drawn into that um our<br>eyes tend to be drawn to the living<br>moving objects because that is part of<br>our survival skills we're genetically<br>programmed to observe moving objects<br>because they may cause us harm um but<br>the red color also indicates harm so I'm<br>very by the life and<br>observers uh William James Drew<br>attention to our cality of Interest<br>while highlighting its perils millions<br>of items in the outward World present to<br>my senses which may properly enter my<br>experience why because they have no<br>interest for me my experience is what I<br>agree to attend to only those items<br>which I noticed shape my mind interest<br>alone gives accent emphasis light and<br>shade background and foreground<br>intelligible perspective in a word so if<br>we look at the image on the right it's<br>more likely that you would describe that<br>as a bird on a rock rather than a rock<br>with a bird on it we still tend to<br>notice the animal form first because we<br>are close to this we tend not to we<br>would say a bird on a rock rather than a<br>bird on likeing would be much more<br>likely to say<br>that uh and this is what we call or has<br>been called by wus the blant plant<br>blindness and it refers to this tendency<br>to overlook plants to fail to rec<br>recognize that they're living beings and<br>simply to regard them as a backdrop for<br>animal life but the term is problematic<br>because of its um ableism and the way<br>that it uh conflates a lack of awareness<br>with a lack of visual acurity so a a<br>scholar uh by Katherine parsley who is<br>herself visually impaired she has<br>proposed the term plant awareness dispar<br>to try and capture this same idea that<br>the problem lies in perception and<br>attention I'm not entirely comfortable<br>with this term yet um sometimes it<br>doesn't seem to catch all one disparity<br>who is the disparity it kind of assumes<br>that their plants awareness of us and so<br>on uh so I'm I'm going to try and use it<br>but if I go wrong forgive me um this<br>stive attention has led us to overlook<br>the forms of intelligent behavior on the<br>plant in relation to the vegetal world<br>this perspective has allowed humans to<br>view plants as passive in their<br>relationship to humans and to overlook<br>the way that they act on us it also<br>enables us to ignore how dependent we<br>are in the vegetal world for generating<br>a livable planet now Lyin is not a plant<br>although it is vegetal it's one of the<br>oldest forms of vegetation on the planet<br>it produces acids that break down the<br>rocks that perform the first Veges of<br>soil um along with mosses these are two<br>of the oldest types of vegetal matter on<br>the planet and they still dominates the<br>landscape of the European Arctic where I<br>live um uh however this particular life<br>in covered rock is part of partly formed<br>by human intervention Hannah spent years<br>spreading the liyen spores using a<br>mixture of sour milk and liyen spores so<br>that the whole Rock would appear in this<br>lovely orange color that matches the<br>coloring of the Siberian J the shot<br>looks natural even though it's actually<br>out belongs as though it belonged<br>outside the human centered anthropos<br>world as though we had no control in<br>that but actually it it is the result of<br>human intervention spreading the liyin<br>and regularly feeding Siberian js on<br>that rock in order to capture this<br>picture it took him over 10 years to<br>create this picture uh and what I find<br>fascinating is this is that he put so<br>much work into building creating the<br>image of the Lykan and yet still our<br>eyes are drawn to the bird um<br>typically right done that um so this<br>particular entanglement then is uh is<br>has in fact benefited the vegetal world<br>but many do not and yet life on this<br>planet including human survival depends<br>on the meshing of multiple more than<br>human intelligences with whom we share<br>the planet the thin layer of hummus that<br>supports all life on land is generated<br>by a small top layer of soil primarily<br>formed from decaying plant matter but<br>also animal matter broken down by fungi<br>by microbes by Critters and by plants<br>that is life on the planet depends on<br>the cycle of multispecies<br>collaboration har Hannah Donna harway uh<br>talks about this as in inhabiting the<br>Huma cities and she talks about how<br>Critters are at stake in EV in each<br>other in every mixing and turning of the<br>Teran compost file we are compost not<br>post posthuman we inhabit the humi not<br>the humanities Critter human and not<br>become with each other compose and<br>decompose each other in every scale and<br>register of time and stuff in semi<br>poetic tangling in ecological<br>evolutionary developmental Earth<br>worlding and unworld I just love the<br>language powerway so I want to include<br>quotes within within my talk in their<br>full form yet such as the arrogance of<br>humankind that attention is currently<br>focused on human- centered algorithms<br>artificial intelligence when our<br>attention should be on the vegetal<br>intelligences that produce the very air<br>we need to breathe the soil in<br>intelligences that nurture us all and<br>other animals with whom we share this<br>planet when faced with these familiar<br>strange intelligences human arrogance<br>assumes that humans have the deciding<br>power human plant studies the approach I<br>adopt in this presentation questions<br>this assumption as to indigenous ways of<br>understanding The Living World which I<br>shall illustrate through one of my<br>examples intelligence is designed uh is<br>defined as the ability to acquire and to<br>use information and skills so so when a<br>plant designs itself for example flowers<br>to attract a specific pollinator such as<br>the sunu sticky pears designed to ATT<br>trap insects it demonstrates the<br>sophisticated acquisition of information<br>and skills needed to attract the<br>pollinator another easily observed plant<br>example of plant position is the bur<br>catching onto a passing creature to use<br>its movement to disperse seed in the new<br>environment other examples include fruit<br>and nuts which encourage an animal to<br>collect it and consume it resulting in<br>the dispers of seed either being spat<br>out into new areas like an orange piit<br>or by passing through the digestive<br>tracks like tomatoes which allows the<br>seed to then be emerge in a rich bed of<br>s or matter now like and Moss proceed to<br>animal life on Earth and so their den<br>designs are not as dependent on animal<br>forms as those of more recent arrivals<br>this does not mean that they lack<br>purpose intent or valtion plants moss<br>and lyen provide the air we breathe the<br>food we eat the pleasures We crave the<br>medicines that prong forong our lives<br>and shelter they also have the power to<br>poison us right now I'm describing<br>vegetal actions using verbs normally<br>associated with human intelligence<br>implying a conscious mind thought and<br>processing and intentionality this may<br>be irritating you it may be IR inerting<br>you because you're aware of the debate<br>surrounding the attribution of brain<br>derived action to living entities that<br>lack<br>SE and alternatively it may be<br>irritating you because in the words of<br>the first Editor to publish my work in<br>this area it is<br>Whimsical my own problems with this<br>language are twofold firstly it troubles<br>me that I an anthrop<br>anthropomorphize vegetal intelligences<br>in ways that render them analogous to<br>human forms of cognition but secondly it<br>troubles me that I don't have a better<br>language to describe what I want to talk<br>about building a sustainable relation<br>between human societies and more than<br>human world on the basis of scientific<br>language alone has proven<br>unsuccessful and while the amount of the<br>natural scientific and data on the<br>degradation of ecosystems and<br>environments has grown exponentially<br>this knowledge has actually failed to<br>drive significant societal cultural<br>changes in human environment relations<br>and this indicates a failure of speaking<br>truth to power especially in the global<br>North for SC social science and human<br>humity theories the human imprint on<br>flry life now often discussed in<br>relationship to the concept of the<br>anthropos indicates that knowledge<br>making Frameworks which depend on the<br>division between humanity and nature are<br>no longer adequate when we need new<br>approaches to knowledge making which<br>would Express this codependence and co-<br>entanglement of human and more than<br>human<br>agencies what is needed are radically<br>new conceptions of more than human<br>intelligences expressed in forms that<br>are meaningful and applicable to humans<br>in their daily<br>lives educational policy documents such<br>as the future of Education skills by<br>oecd and UNESCO emphasize the creative<br>layers such as curiosity Wonder<br>creativity and Imagination to supplement<br>traditional skills like reading and numy<br>and here I argue that we need those<br>creative Liars alongside the natural<br>scientific knowledges in order to engage<br>with more than human intelligences we<br>need to turn this knowledge gain from<br>thought experience into communal<br>knowledge and for this I draw on<br>storying and restoration as tools for<br>sense making Donna haraway's uh idea<br>about storytelling is also her method<br>she describes it as having the capacity<br>to evoke an ethics of care each time a<br>story helps me remember what I thought I<br>knew or helps me to new knowledge a<br>muscle critical for caring about<br>flourishing gets some aerobic exercise<br>such exercises enhances Collective<br>thinking and movement into<br>complexity so in this presentation I am<br>interested in the story uh from three<br>books and how they uh promote the<br>capacity for empathetic care but it<br>wasn't a typo I am uninterested in<br>whether children would be a to<br>understand this I'm interested in the<br>more of thought experiments to<br>understand what it might be to think in<br>this particular way I have to push back<br>against the text in order to find the<br>plants those are with with within them<br>storying has been understood in a great<br>variety of ways but I identify three<br>main themes with within them the first<br>is the kind of Western model which looks<br>at storing as a kind of a tool for<br>thinking and communicating ideas and<br>that has built into it the idea that the<br>the idea exists prior to the<br>storytelling about the<br>idea the second way it draws more on the<br>kind of indigenous model<br>a thinking of story as a means of<br>remembering for paying respect or as a<br>gift um in this idea that there is uh<br>for example A Y which is the kind of s<br>singing that the Sami do um to well<br>there you always y to something or to<br>someone um and that is a y to an animal<br>would be a gift to the animal but it<br>also serves as a tool for knowing the<br>animal more<br>intimately indigenous Scholars such as<br>for and have noticed the tendency within<br>Western Academia which she calls<br>epistemic ignorance that is when ideas<br>drawn from indigenous sources are taken<br>outside the indigenous cosmology simply<br>taking elements such as storing and<br>using it peace ignorant in her view so<br>using the story there was simply a tool<br>for communicating ideas and then<br>ascribing this form to indigenous<br>knowledge moves Beyond epistemic<br>ignorance to epistemic<br>violence um and in this presentation I<br>do not align myself with this second<br>view although one of the characters that<br>I discuss in the stories does perhaps<br>align herself in this<br>way uh the Third Way of uh thinking<br>about storying would be to consider it a<br>means of communicating with more than<br>human others to think about how they<br>might communicate with us uh this is<br>particularly evident in the work of<br>Monica gagana who claims that the true<br>authorship of Thus Spoke the plant were<br>the plants themselves and in then the<br>final part of this presentation I<br>examine a novel in which the protagonist<br>demonstrates her capacity to actually<br>listen to what the plants want to say so<br>all the works are works from children's<br>literature um and um I've taken one that<br>is English and I do mean English not<br>British so the Lost words uh and then I<br>have um what I'm a section I'm going to<br>call becoming compost uh which is<br>written primarily in Swedish but it's<br>set in the Borderlands between Finland<br>and Sweden um and the idea is that the<br>the child characters home language would<br>be May Andi which is a crle version of<br>Finnish with lots of Swedish influences<br>and some Sami influences uh and it turns<br>out in the story that this child's<br>father is in fact<br>Sami uh and then the final one is set in<br>Cuba uh and it's a bilingual book so<br>it's published in verse uh it's uh<br>written in both Spanish and in English<br>so the translations that appear on from<br>Big B as if I did wasn't as if I wasn't<br>there the second book are my own um but<br>the other ones I'm just in English<br>versions of<br>them so starting with uh losing contact<br>uh with a book that explores what<br>happens when we become unmeshed from the<br>world so Robert mfar and Jackie Morris's<br>lost worth began derise from a problem<br>that emerged when the school dictionary<br>was revised during the revision several<br>words that relate to the Natural work<br>were removed and supposedly because<br>children were not using them and the<br>quote there is about how um how this<br>came to be so once upon the time the<br>words began to vanish from the children<br>language of children they disappeared so<br>quietly at first that no one noticed<br>faing away like water on stone so what<br>words were missing Acorn Adder Bluebell<br>Bramble coner gone Fern Heather king<br>fisher otter Raven Willow Ren all of<br>them gone the words were no longer were<br>becoming lost no longer Vivid in the<br>children's sto voices no longer alive in<br>their stories and this is a spell book<br>it's a play on words and the structure<br>of the book is first such that first<br>there is an image or in which the uh the<br>name of the plant or the animal that is<br>gone missing and there's a jumble of<br>letters and the idea is that you have to<br>spell out the word find what what is the<br>the thing that is missing here so here<br>we have blue bells the blue bells are<br>missing uh you have to chase the letters<br>to find the word and then by saying the<br>word alloud you produce this kind of<br>Botanical<br>image that is you perform the spell and<br>it brings it into assistance but it's<br>isolated from Context and this<br>botanically detailed illustration is<br>like those uh um that come from the line<br>system now the primary purpose of the<br>Lan system as John Charles Ry observes<br>is to produce a universal system that<br>can transcend cultural Regional and<br>linguistic specificity and so enable<br>people around the world to refer to<br>their lived environment in the same way<br>now the categories of the linear system<br>are generated solely on the basis of the<br>plant's appearance and their means of<br>rep reproduction without reference to<br>the physical environment in which they<br>grow so it's deliberately cont context<br>independent and it's also a hierarchical<br>system begins with the Three Kingdoms<br>animal vegetable<br>mineral and which are then divided into<br>the Gen Gena and then down to species<br>now it's in worth noting that L's system<br>has also divided humans into four<br>species uh and that has been completely<br>blown apart and yet we still accept the<br>linear system is also being blown apart<br>in his relation in relationship to his<br>descriptions of the mineral world but<br>for plants it still seems to hold um and<br>underpins our everyday thinking about<br>plants Ryan questions the TA the tax<br>taxonomy and the reduction of by<br>disecting living beer body into its<br>constituent Parts he also shows that<br>before Lin's taxonomy knowledge of<br>plants was intimately connected with the<br>human body through herbal medicine and<br>he talks about Nicholas cpers the<br>complete herbal which was first<br>published in 1653 which encourages<br>readers to by a range of Senses so touch<br>and smell and taste as well as sight to<br>determine which plants are likely to<br>proove with most effective When<br>developing medicinal compounds impulses<br>and elixis so even at the time when L's<br>work was first published it was<br>questioned by the Swiss naturalist<br>Albert vanhall who argued for the role<br>of geography in understanding flora and<br>Temple changes as these are absolutely<br>Central so uh this is a somewhat<br>problematic image in many ways that it's<br>a kind of biological one but then by<br>reading allowed a poem so by spelling<br>you um it is appeared but look what<br>actually happens the whole Blue Bell is<br>lost it it's no longer a an individual<br>flower it's not even a plant anymore<br>it's just a color backdrop for a plant<br>now to me this is an example of loss<br>this is um plant blindness or plant<br>Awareness<br>disparates on the on the bird not on the<br>flower<br>itself the text that accompanies uh this<br>image oh oh sorry sorry and this isn't<br>sorry and just to show that this isn't a<br>oneof so you see that coner dandelion<br>Bramble they still look like the actual<br>plant itself Heather looks less like the<br>plant itself but in all cases what is<br>um this loss of ination is is most yeah<br>so the text that accompanies them is<br>takes the form of a prootics uh and I'm<br>not even going to read that aloud<br>because I just think it's so terrible<br>again the idea is the readers will seek<br>out the words spelling making spells<br>it's a very clever marketing device for<br>a school system that insists that<br>children produce poetry Without Really<br>caring about the quality of that<br>poetry to dat analysis of this book and<br>it's sequel the lost spells focused on<br>the idea of Rec Conjuring the words that<br>have been removed from the dictionary<br>because they were not deemed important<br>to know and the beauty of the<br>illustrations and there it is a really<br>beautiful book that I can't really get<br>across that in this PowerPoint but it's<br>got gold uh shining imagery it's<br>extraordinarily<br>beautiful um but as you see from this<br>truly atrocious poem about the blue<br>bells it's actually um The Poetry is<br>pretty terrible but it's very hard to<br>get away from the beautiful idea behind<br>this text in a study subtitled skillful<br>sensing Katherine Ola Notes The<br>Importance of Being able to sense one's<br>surroundings for understanding climate<br>crisis she notes that the effects may be<br>easy to perceive when you're running<br>from a forest fire or caught by flooding<br>but harder to perceive in the slow<br>sensing of the everyday she notes how if<br>we cannot recognize a particular bird<br>song we will not notice its absence if<br>we do not know when a tree normally<br>blooms we will not notice them it B<br>blooming early as a result of global<br>warming quite simply if we're not able<br>to sense the slow impact of the osine we<br>will not change our behaviors losing the<br>vocabulary to describe the living world<br>is symptomatic of this inability to pay<br>attention to the world around us and if<br>we cannot describe the Living World then<br>we will not pay due attention<br>nevertheless this very logocentric human<br>Centric way of viewing the world is<br>deeply problematic the literal<br>imposition of the language onto the<br>environment as plants are replaced by<br>alphabetic symbols resonates with the<br>human centeredness of um Adam naming<br>every living creature language helps us<br>PID your attention but repeatedly send<br>us back into the world where humankind<br>is in the center as though we were<br>normal not just common and the across<br>fit poetry is let's just go with<br>problematic but what about the<br>undeniable beauty of this book the<br>images are National romantic and the<br>book does not travel well in a fourth<br>coming article by Erin spring and her<br>colleagues they discuss how poorly the<br>Lost words fit with their Canadian and<br>blackf foot context in no small J Parts<br>due to the history of<br>colonization I agree but actually I find<br>the context specificity of the book one<br>of its strengths um is it really draws a<br>light on the context specificity of<br>where plants can flourish this<br>particular Blue Bell is the English Blue<br>Bell it doesn't live well even in<br>Scotland or<br>Wales I do take issue with the beauty of<br>the book my problem with the beauty of<br>the book is its habit of always favoring<br>beautiful plants youthful plants and<br>cute fluffy furry animals with eyes that<br>resemble humans at the expense of what<br>Donna Haro calls the on ongoing sneaky<br>unheroic tentacular dread<br>once earthworms ants termites and dung<br>beetles all have vital roles play in<br>generating fertile soils but human<br>attention is drawn to companion speeches<br>species which typically have eyes enjoy<br>grooming or animals that serve a<br>functions such as providing transport<br>and of food and there is a long TR<br>tradition of anthropo mizing these cute<br>animals and interpreting their<br>intelligent behaviors in human terms but<br>humans might survive the extinction of<br>chenes but will not survive the loss of<br>pollinating basts and flies Earth<br>breaking worms and beetles and others<br>who provide us with the composted matter<br>vital to sustaining the soil so to sum<br>up if we understand relations with<br>plants with the way envisaged in the L<br>words we will continue down the same<br>destructive Road we're on naming a blue<br>belt will not promote an ethics of care<br>if that perception is then reduced to a<br>color black drop of the beautiful bar<br>now focusing on the human human language<br>human Aesthetics human power relations<br>is simply more of the same so my next<br>case study moves then to the Border<br>areas uh it is available as a film uh in<br>with English subtitles so you can see it<br>but many of the things that I'm talking<br>about won't actually appear in in the<br>film um I'm taking out one part of the<br>story and exaggerating it because that's<br>how I look at that that's my method for<br>for refining plants it is actually about<br>a school policy where children were<br>forced to study in in Swedish and were<br>punished for not doing so uh and the<br>main Thrive of the narrative is actually<br>to talk about this young girl whose<br>father has just died um and her<br>difficulties in school where she has to<br>operate in Swedish although her home<br>language is<br>mayangi uh and she also had problems um<br>with the food and this reflects a very<br>real situation so it's uh it's a fairly<br>old book but it's one that's in very<br>important because it is part of the<br>compulsory uh sorry learning about this<br>historical event is compulsory in<br>Swedish schools but there are very few<br>materials available so although it's a<br>fairly old book it is actually quite<br>well known within the Swedish<br>context so in staying with the travel um<br>Donna har posits that we are compost uh<br>and in that turning of the compost bre<br>causes new entanglements with other<br>forms of life and in doing so she<br>foregrounds the process of decay in the<br>renewal of life in mod than human<br>ecologies this nerve Network means that<br>we are not alone even when we feel<br>lonely or alone and we do not get to act<br>alone either as all our actions hold<br>implications for the lelt the the<br>meshing the the way in which a living<br>experience experiences<br>life envisaging ourselves as compost<br>Demands a recognition that we are all<br>Critters heading towards death and that<br>now is the moment to consider what kind<br>of ancestor we wish to become at the<br>same time haray suggests it behoves us<br>to rethink consider our lives in the<br>sick presence as a meshing with other<br>life forms including earthworms microbes<br>and<br>fungi and she talks about how this helps<br>us to uh this meshing helps us to live<br>and die well uh and living and dying<br>well is one of the kind of themes of of<br>about sorry um got out of my notes right<br>so<br>someo as though I wasn't there uh it's<br>invisible elen is the way that it's been<br>translated into English um the original<br>is the original is as though I wasn't<br>there Elena spends time in the Maya<br>because she feels a connection to the<br>spirit of her dead father there when her<br>teacher starts to behave as though she<br>were not there that's the title of the<br>the novel if I literally translate it<br>Elena runs away to the mire normally<br>she's very agile in the mire and can<br>jump from tough to tough finding her way<br>safely<br>when she runs away from school however<br>she is lur to the most dangerous parts<br>of the m and becomes trapped the climax<br>of the novel involves Elena being<br>rescued and receiving an apology from<br>her teacher although Ellena is portrayed<br>as having May and KY as her home<br>language because her mother's family<br>came from the finished side of the<br>Border a careful reading of the text<br>concerning elen's father indicates that<br>he was in fact Sami uh and more<br>specifically that he appears to be one<br>of the SMY who lost their rights in the<br>1928 uh hering act and if that's<br>interesting to you as we talk about that<br>afterwards more importantly for my<br>discussion ellena's connection with<br>Amaya resonates with Sami worlding<br>practices especially her respect for all<br>living organisms selfhood she recognized<br>the plants and the Maya as having<br>autonomy and intention and she also IND<br>participates in what indigenous Scholars<br>such as pami botan botanist uh Robin or<br>Kimmer talks about as the web of web of<br>reciprocity sty scholar around Quan<br>explains that in order to maintain the<br>balance of the socio Cosmic order gifts<br>of the land must be actively<br>acknowledged through practices acts and<br>ceremonies which Express gratitude and<br>which recognize that the land is a<br>living being that cannot be endlessly<br>exploited this relationship is not a<br>mechanistic exchange rather it reflects<br>a way of being in the world pred<br>predicated on active participation in<br>its processes and in this novel I<br>understand that as being becoming konos<br>the novel starts sorry I'm still here<br>um the novel starts with Elena creeping<br>towards the Meer as quietly as she can<br>uh it was it wasn't as easy today as it<br>had been the frost had made the grass<br>stiff and it rustled gently it was<br>important not to frighten the invisible<br>ones away the invisible ones are um part<br>of the salon<br>mythology they live in the Cyber in the<br>spirit world in saling world there is a<br>constant measuring meshing between the<br>worlds sometimes for example in the<br>Northern Lights the boundaries between<br>the worlds are more permeable for Elena<br>the Maya forms a place where the<br>boundaries are are interpenetrated and<br>so she comes to the Maya to deal with<br>her bereavement she feels the presence<br>of her father's Spirit there but in<br>addition she also senses the presence of<br>a cow that wandered into the mire and<br>never return moving Waters and several<br>plants uh including a birch and a fern<br>who has per profal names she also<br>renames herself in the<br>Maya so Myers have formed one of wet<br>areas such as shallow Lakes have formed<br>from melting snow or glassier that<br>become filled with plants most commonly<br>spagna noses which Kimmer veins create<br>their<br>own uh their own ecosystem there's no<br>ecosystem on Earth where mes that chain<br>more prominence than in the spum bul<br>there is more living carbon in fagman<br>Moss than in any other single genus of<br>the plant on the planet inter testro<br>have mes have been overshadowed by the<br>vascular glants and assume relatively<br>minor roles but in buls they are Supreme<br>fagman and Peak mes not only flourishing<br>bogs they create them now the Samu<br>understand all lands including rock<br>formations as living but it takes an act<br>of willful ignorance a form of plant<br>awareness disparity for anyone not to<br>recognize the Meers as living in death<br>the Moss is decomposed to form Pete<br>which then provides the habitats needed<br>for the vascular plants although acidic<br>is slightly less acidic than the me<br>itself and can support shrugs and plants<br>however the level of acidity DET deter<br>many larger plants for making use of the<br>environment Kimmer also explains how the<br>Spiderman leave the the soil<br>saturated which the roots of the larger<br>trees require air and need soil that it<br>has space for air between the particles<br>and so by filling those spaces with<br>water the Moss prevents large trees from<br>taking root and the M remains open and<br>sunny allowing the the living cells to<br>photosynthesize the small trees that do<br>grow there some kinds of birch and pine<br>occasionally Willow remain stunted in<br>comparison with the trees that growing<br>in more arated soil with a more neutral<br>pH it Al these stunted trees Decay they<br>too are absorbed into the beat however<br>the leaf mold that they produce from<br>these deciduous trees will gradually<br>aate the soil making it possible for<br>Forest to emerge trees growing in the<br>mire are thus contribute to the web of<br>Rosy being good ancestors to the larger<br>trees that will follow ellena's<br>participation in the web of Rosy it<br>results in actions that directly nurture<br>the Maya by living as Compass she does<br>not just take from the living breathing<br>landm she also gives on her journey to<br>the m at the beginning of the story she<br>looks at the leaves that are lying on<br>the ground she picked up a large golden<br>leaf and carried it with her she looked<br>at the sensitive nurse leaves are more<br>beautiful than people she thought it was<br>perfect well formed the leaf would have<br>a home in the Meer perhaps it would we<br>ear for its own tree but it would<br>already fall into the ground it would<br>never refer to um return to its own<br>Branch but out no on the Maya it would<br>be become one with the Maya rest under<br>the blanket of snow or winter become one<br>with the soil<br>merge um so I this idea of becoming one<br>with a mile resting under the blanket of<br>snow merging she will put it next to the<br>Papa place his Spirit would Rejoice so<br>she brings the leaf which will then<br>produce leaf mold which will then create<br>the kind of environment where a tree can<br>grow so the description of the leaf<br>positions it as convox being part of the<br>Liv world of the tree but now its<br>purpose is to become a future ancestor<br>the living and dead are not separate but<br>rather parts of an assemblage associated<br>with that place Elena is bringing the<br>gift of food to the Maya she brings it<br>to the Papa place the place where she<br>feels the strongest connection to her<br>father Spirit she then engages in a<br>narrative in which she acknowledges the<br>presence of<br>evil uh and various other kind of living<br>creatures within the<br>Maya um she also brings Gifts of little<br>Twigs so uh she weaves a little map a m<br>mat of twigs and puts it over uh an<br>anness in Elena's M world uh she sorry<br>uh<br>so yeah Ellen action inum involve<br>providing vegetable matter that feeds<br>the compost in the form of the leaf and<br>twigs and weaving the small matter Twigs<br>which then places over the antle The<br>Twig weaving is intended to help the<br>cow's Spirit esap Escape while its body<br>still feeds the mile now this kind of<br>construction would obviously not<br>actually prevent ants from moving but it<br>does suggest that she regards the ants<br>as moving between the lands of the dead<br>and the lands of the living between the<br>spirit world and the world in which he<br>lives as a becoming ancestor tors ANS<br>would be unlikely to welcome the<br>structure but they might recycle the<br>matter to produce their own architecture<br>they perform a vital role in Forest<br>breaking down vegetable and animal<br>matter to produce environments which in<br>which fungi bacteria mosses and liken<br>can reproduce to perform the kind of<br>compost that's needed to sustain life on<br>this planet but from this we can<br>determine it makes biological<br>biologically no sense to think that<br>there would actually be an antill in the<br>middle of a bog because uh ants don't<br>like to be in wet places like that so<br>the only way we can interpret that is<br>just say that the papa place is a small<br>island where the soil is deep enough to<br>support humans and to keep them dry to<br>reach the paper place uh Elena has to<br>jump from toughed TFT and she descri<br>this described as being quite a tricky<br>thing reaching the puer place if you<br>feel falling between the toughs you are<br>dead I had a quote for that one<br>um so you risk death arrival means<br>Sanctuary the boundaries between the two<br>worlds are not<br>absolute uh<br>the the mesing between the worlds of the<br>living and dead in in Eleni worlding<br>practices comes very close to the<br>reality of the spag and led way of being<br>himmer describes the way in which the<br>living and the dead cells intermesh with<br>the plant cells as follows the<br>asymmetric corelation of 1 to 20 of<br>living to dead cells in a single plant<br>Mur the structure of the entire blob<br>most of the bog is dead unseen uh<br>wicking the dead cells Wick the water up<br>through the Des and carrying it to the<br>living L layer above the density of the<br>plants growing in a mile is such that<br>they form in highly effective carbon<br>sinks and thus essential for addressing<br>the climate crisis and promoting human<br>chances of its survival the lack of<br>human reciprocity in this relationship<br>is starting the only time other people<br>come to the marsh is when uh to pick<br>Cloud<br>berries now Cloud berries as this uh<br>image shows you at the bottom uh they<br>are you I they don't grow in many parts<br>of the world so they they're a bit like<br>a A rasbery in the sense that you<br>consume theer they contain seeds that<br>pass through the digesting tract so that<br>visitors U might be considered becoming<br>compost however unlike the other animals<br>who eat the berries humans are unlikely<br>to leave the seeds in a place that will<br>actually be an advantage to the plant<br>navigating in this environment envire<br>requires a person to distinguish where<br>the spongy mat of living mes is strong<br>enough to Bear their weight and the<br>weaker areas that will cause supression<br>to sink the decaying process is such<br>that the spongy masses May extend down<br>for very many meters and stepping off<br>the beach into the living the Mosses is<br>like stepping up a raft into into the<br>water and just as you can't push down on<br>the water to lift yourself up you can't<br>push down on a m to lift oneself kicking<br>your legs is likely to C cause you to<br>sink instead you need to almost swim<br>over the surface now in real<br>life uh in real life the edges between<br>the areas that are strong enough to hold<br>human weight and the areas where you are<br>likely to S you'll get a warming you'll<br>get a boot full of water first but in<br>literature the edges are dramatic the<br>literary life and death struggle for<br>survival suggest that the collective<br>thinking about Myers and mes is that<br>they are in fact lifethreatening in<br>which is quite contrary to they are in<br>but likely to save our lives Ellen's<br>close connection to the spirit of her<br>father prevents her from Living Well in<br>the thick presence she cuts herself St<br>off from the world of the living humans<br>reorganizing her routines and her<br>psychic space to come into closer<br>contact with the vegetal world and in<br>this way she lives her life as compost<br>however uh uh it does entail certain<br>risks in the main narrative when Ellen<br>is treated as though she doesn't exist<br>by her teacher she is uh she runs away<br>to the May and doesn't pay attention and<br>so she falls in she's rescued by her<br>teacher and in the book it's actually um<br>her teacher's wife the teacher's wife<br>without picking mushrooms which again<br>makes no biological sense but<br>whatever um but if we think about what<br>this means in terms of nutrients for the<br>plants if we look at this from a plant<br>perspective Elena falling into the thing<br>she is there to provide soil but what<br>what kind of soil not soil for the<br>Mosses of the mouse but rather for the<br>papa place to create that that kind of<br>soil thick soil that is needed for the<br>vascular<br>plants so understanding the um spag<br>mosses incorporation of dead matter into<br>living matter is directly analogist to<br>the sty understandings of the meshing of<br>the worlds of the living and the dead is<br>one way of thinking about the moss in<br>the story context this acting on this<br>belief actually endangers Elena's life<br>however as a speculative activity it<br>opens up a new way of engaging with<br>vegetal intelligences by storing with<br>plants and with her ancestors Elena<br>addresses her reement and regains a<br>sense of selfhood that has been<br>questioned by her teacher and up until<br>the point in which she offers herself as<br>food for the Mya to feed on the<br>relationship is nurturing and<br>reciprocal uh and in the final example<br>oh I'm going to jump that that I'm going<br>to take is from Cuba um and this this<br>was the the one that was considered to<br>be two Whimsical for Words uh by my by<br>the first<br>um so this is a verse poem as they say<br>it's published in simultaneously in<br>Spanish and English uh and it's set in<br>Cuba uh and it tells the story of the<br>Three VI Wars uh towards independence uh<br>and ends with the raising of the<br>American flag and the sad recognition<br>that they've kind of fought so hard to<br>get rid of the Spanish that now they've<br>now been taken over by the<br>Americans uh the story St is about<br>uh several characters uh and what I want<br>to suggest in this one is that the<br>native Flor and forner and even the<br>mineral world as betrayed in Engles<br>poetry play an active role into who<br>lanin to Cuban uh Nativity now as an<br>island nobody has ever suggest<br>questioned its borders but who is Cuban<br>is a question of timing in the sense<br>that the indigenous people the arak um<br>were all killed by<br>um either by by force or by small<br>pox nle uses the historical figures of<br>Rosio castellan castan know Rosa La<br>mesas who's here in the down bottom left<br>and her husband Jose franisco Varona as<br>her primary vantage point to express<br>this intimate connection between human<br>Cuban peoples and that Island<br>Home Rosa is committed to to Healing her<br>treatment centers refer to as hospitals<br>and her herbal cures there's green<br>medicine and the EOG informs us that<br>these are still common in Cuba today she<br>also treats her enemies as well as her<br>people and some of those whom she treats<br>CH treats change sides others most<br>notably left him in death continue to<br>hunt her even after she has saved his<br>life<br>uh Cuba's turbulent history a uh battles<br>fought for European between the European<br>nations and were then America for<br>dominance in the Caribbean were<br>primarily fought over plants the devire<br>for plants such as Ginger sugar cane<br>Indigo sweet potato casaba tobacco and<br>cotton all of which were indigenous to<br>the region was the root course and<br>intended for uh for the wars fought in<br>the Caribbean Basin from the arrival of<br>of Columbus onwards indeed I was suggest<br>it's no exaggeration to say that the<br>slave trade itself was established in<br>order to provide plants with the care<br>they needed in order to to produce their<br>desired Beauty humans have literally<br>been willing to enslave one another for<br>their desire for plants in the botony of<br>Desire Michael Poland introduced four<br>principal desire human desires which<br>have shaped human plant relationships<br>sweetness Beauty intoxication and<br>control which he discussed discussed in<br>relationship to the Apple pulip<br>marijuana and the potato now the same<br>desires underlight that each of the car<br>car and crops that the Europeans wanted<br>to colonize Ginger and sugar cane<br>exploit human desires for sweetness and<br>spice Indico provided affordable<br>clothing die in a region starved of<br>beauty of color tobacco's sulfur purpose<br>is to<br>intoxicate uh and sweet potato and Casa<br>can also produce these although they<br>were provid provide primarily grown in<br>order to fill the stomach and cotton<br>provided comfortable Fabrics stomach<br>curiously poen ignor IGN the medicinal<br>value of plants touching briefly uh only<br>on the capacity of marijuana to num pay<br>and serve as a medicine in the treatment<br>of those dis and suffering from<br>conditions such as cancer and multiple<br>sclerosis nevertheless the world of<br>pharmaceuticals is almost entirely<br>dependent on plants for raw<br>ingredients in the first section of the<br>novel called the names of plants uh Rosa<br>learns to classify the vegetation like C<br>pepper she understands the regional<br>Flora in relationship to the powers the<br>plants possess and learning how to find<br>them which she demands that she sees the<br>world from the plants perspective where<br>would the plants St U um where would<br>they flourish but notice how this<br>learning of the names is quite different<br>from in the Lost words she's learning<br>the names because she's trying to get to<br>know the plants she wants to know what<br>they can do how they can act sometimes<br>she says I feel like a bee making honey<br>a bee feared by all the wild bees and we<br>also see this being used a weapon so in<br>fact that she says that they are<br>harmless stingless and harmless and yet<br>because the invading soldiers don't know<br>that they can use tricks with hives to<br>send the bees uh towards the soldiers so<br>that the soldiers will Retreat or<br>without knowing that they are in fact<br>harmless she's also by aligning herself<br>with the bee she is aligning herself as<br>a<br>pollinator uh sorry yes I'm<br>uh she does not impose her names onto<br>the plants as lus does but rather tries<br>to learn the plant's own<br>names uh this uh she suggests so um<br>she<br>uh the yeah the soldiers fear her magic<br>powers because as a like an alchemist<br>she develops medicines from her<br>surroundings she's not consistently<br>successful and must learn to know the<br>healing flowers of each plant separately<br>one flower cures only certain fevers<br>which try another we fail then we try a<br>root Leaf Moss or burn one petal fails<br>another succeeds unlikely Nas Rosa<br>classifies the plants in what terms of<br>what they do notice that they have<br>ascribed subjectivity they cure they uh<br>fail they succeed they ascribe the power<br>of of their own<br>valtion we roses weapons in the struggle<br>for Independence are simply petals armed<br>with fragrant herbs fighting in the<br>woodness of my own private war against<br>death Rose's enemies are unable to<br>understand her symbiotic relationship<br>with the plants and describe all the<br>power she has to herself rather than to<br>the cumulated for them she is the witch<br>not the<br>plant um I'm G to jump over this bit<br>because burun out of<br>time uh but she Associates herself with<br>the forner of the island again picking<br>up the notion uh of having um<br>of of uh the idea of birds um and she<br>refers to the soldiers behaving like uh<br>the parakeet uh noisy chatting Birds<br>which actually because they're so noisy<br>it makes it possible for the Cubans to<br>hide themselves and just shrink away<br>which is why they appear to<br>disappear but notice when she says<br>animals and plants help me learn how to<br>understand all the ways of what people<br>are trying to say so this is a complete<br>reversal of the normal pattern of having<br>plants as kind of a backdrop or as<br>reflecting human concerns for Rosa it's<br>a way of she understands the plants and<br>through the plants she can understand<br>what people are trying to say so it's<br>reverse of these uh two<br>systems but even Rosa cannot manage<br>everything um uh and she uh she has to<br>draw on additional Powers uh and she<br>draws on the powers of the Crystal Caves<br>that we see in um in Cuba and day big<br>tourist attractions so she draws on the<br>crystal Powers um she uses lights from<br>the form in the form of um fireflies to<br>to light up the Gaze to bring in the<br>healing powers of the<br>crystals but this only works when she's<br>trying to do good when she is uh sent<br>out as a young child to try and uh help<br>cure runaway slaves so that they can be<br>returned to<br>slavery um<br>she her the the Rocks actually break her<br>down so the sharp rocks slice my face<br>and hands I would be useless without<br>Health he fingers so she won't be able<br>to help the the slaves be restored to um<br>Health in order to be able to continue<br>enslaved<br>life so what I'm trying to suggest here<br>is that in this book it's the the<br>plants and to some extent the animals<br>and even the rock formations are the<br>ones who have the power to decide who is<br>Cuban they are the ones with the valtion<br>and the power uh to make the decisions<br>but it is not a human made<br>decision the novel ends with the section<br>titled the set the the surrender tree<br>the place where the Spanish flag is<br>lower than the American flag is raised<br>also reveals that the tree itself the<br>kok the a gigantic native tree<br>considered Sacred by many of the ethnic<br>groups who inhabit uh Cuba the cover of<br>the the surrender tree depicts the COK<br>in a pool of blood held by a human hand<br>both the tree and the Hand of black and<br>the hu of the black red blood and the<br>yellow background are the same as the<br>Spanish BL the battle has fought over<br>the veget vegetable products such as<br>tobacco Indigo coffee and even the COK<br>itself is it fibers are used to produce<br>filling for mattresses up Fuller teddy<br>bears and gusion um will Outlast human<br>lives<br>so to bring that together I've presented<br>three kind of pace studies the one in<br>losing contact where simply imposing<br>human order onto the environment<br>continues the downward spiral it's a<br>form of green washing it doesn't take it<br>anywhere and then I've introduced this<br>idea of becoming compost the idea that<br>we need to live within the web of<br>reciprocity that we need to be good<br>anest but there's also warning there of<br>a loss of self and then in the final one<br>I suggested that maybe we could think<br>about what does it mean to be native or<br>what does it need to be to belong to an<br>area and how actually the plants<br>themselves might have the valtion to be<br>able to decide that for rest uh and that<br>also that they these learning to<br>understand these intelligence will<br>provide us with the well-being that we<br>need for our<br>survival</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
