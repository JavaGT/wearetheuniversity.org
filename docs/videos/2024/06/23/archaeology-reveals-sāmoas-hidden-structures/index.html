font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the discovery that my team and I have<br>made in Samoa is that we are uncovering<br>the origins of hierarchical society in s<br>and also perhaps in the World At Large<br>um we've done this by first uh noting a<br>dramatic rise in population in s about a<br>thousand years ago from a previous<br>genetic study and we've paired that with<br>archaeology and environmental science to<br>understand the development of the<br>archaeological landscape that consists<br>of massive rock walls boundary walls<br>agricultural ditches platforms that are<br>used for ceremonies and housing and all<br>of those structures begin about a<br>thousand years ago and in doing so we<br>think we have the kind of Rise of<br>chiefdom like behaviors and control and<br>power of those over those populations<br>beginning in those sem areas around that<br>same time the technology that we use to<br>find these archaeological structures<br>which are ubiquitous across landscape is<br>called lidar and it's a mapping<br>technology that involves firing lasers<br>from an airplane and those lasers are<br>bounced off the ground surface and<br>caught by instruments in the plane again<br>to produce a really precise map that<br>cuts through the vegetation and the<br>jungle to reveal just the bare ground<br>below including these massive uh border<br>walls ditches and platforms and it it's<br>um really revolutionized archaeology in<br>around the world not only in the Pacific<br>but also plac places like Central<br>America where you have dense jungle the<br>universities involved include the<br>University of Auckland the University of<br>Hawaii and the University of Canterbury<br>um and graduate students PhD students<br>and Master's students as well as<br>students and staff from the National<br>University of Samoa and their Center for<br>Samoan studies in particular people on<br>the ground that I kind of work with<br>every day are mostly s and men from The<br>Villages and they help us to clear Bush<br>to identify structures to do the work of<br>excavation essentially all the things<br>that I do in the field they do with me<br>um and the knowledge that we've gained<br>from this uh project is uh relevant to<br>people in Samoa as well so the again the<br>local Sans that I talk to every day<br>they're fascinated by the kinds of<br>findings we have um that tell tell about<br>uh political boundaries that don't exist<br>anymore or structures that are now<br>uncovered and are related to oral<br>Traditions that they've grown up with um<br>the Chiefs themselves in the Villages<br>are fascinated by um the timing of these<br>developments that link up with<br>traditionally known genealogies that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
