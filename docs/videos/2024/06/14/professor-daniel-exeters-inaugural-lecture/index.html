it's<br>wonderful to see such an uh fantastic<br>turnout I think this is probably the<br>fullest turnout we've had this year so<br>if there's a little race going on Dan I<br>think you're in the in in the lead just<br>at the moment um not that you're<br>competitive um because I hear we're all<br>about social justice spatial Justice<br>tonight um as I mentioned last time for<br>those of you here I think we're going to<br>have a competition for the titles and we<br>might run a little poll um which will<br>rival the the lottery win that's going<br>on the weekend um to see who had the<br>best title for the year no in all<br>seriousness It's a Wonderful pleasure to<br>have colleagues friends and family here<br>with Dan tonight to celebrate um what is<br>an outstanding achievement and<br>recognition of excellence in research<br>teaching and service and in every one of<br>those boxes Dan you exceed and Excel so<br>it's really a great pleasure to welcome<br>you all here this evening for those of<br>you who aren't familiar with the process<br>it is a huge undertaking to make it to<br>become a professor um it is uh not<br>undertaken lightly and it's with many<br>years of work and international<br>recognition that you only get to be<br>called Professor so um to formally<br>introduce you to Professor Dan exitor<br>I'm going to call on N curse to do that<br>and then we'll let Dan have a chance so<br>welcome up Nar thank<br>H uh well I'm surprised to be here not<br>because I knew Dan would be here I'm<br>surprised he asked me to ruce<br>him but I'm very honored and I'm very<br>pleased to do so but you still don't<br>know what I'm going to say do you<br>um so how do you<br>int he and he hasn't paid me so how do<br>you introduce a new professor it's it is<br>an esteemed thing for me to do it is a<br>wonderful honor to become a professor it<br>has been wonderful to see Dan over the<br>years come through the school and<br>through the various levels he's actually<br>been with us since the 1990s when he<br>used to work in the community health so<br>he knows all of the people who've been<br>here longer than me some of whom are in<br>the room and um and I'm sure you have<br>many stories to tell especially about<br>the various moves that Community Health<br>has made over the years as I was trying<br>to prepare this talk I reflected on the<br>school of population Health's Mission<br>providing the knowledge and skills<br>needed to improve the health of all<br>people by Focus in on factors that<br>affect the well-being of entire<br>populations and I think Dan really<br>exemplifies this Mission his career is<br>built on a focus on equity on fairness<br>on ways to explore and visualize and<br>study those factors affecting well-being<br>through geographical Health inequalities<br>that was the title of his PhD which was<br>from St Andrews in Scotland it was<br>almost from Lancaster I'm show but was<br>I've told but there was a last minute<br>change and he followed the supervisor to<br>uh St Andrews and I think that was a<br>good thing in the long<br>run that followed his Masters in GIS<br>which of course is the visualization<br>software for health and a lot of other<br>things um and I know we will hear more<br>about that now geography what do I think<br>of with geography I think of maps isn't<br>that lucky because Dan uses maps in ways<br>that I couldn't even have imagined<br>before I saw the<br>maps um it's perhaps better put as<br>understanding the complex interplay<br>between geographical context<br>socioeconomic position and health but<br>the visualization that Maps give you has<br>really got a lot of salience with<br>ordinary people in the field with<br>governments with researchers and it's a<br>a very powerful tool it is also heavily<br>statistical and a little birdie told me<br>that Dan actually failed stats at High<br>School<br>so so it is a new day a man with<br>assistance Dan Also Rises to meet the<br>challenges I know we will also hear much<br>about this but I did want to mention<br>this thing called triple one 111 what is<br>that that is a large class of over a<br>thousand students who were all competing<br>horribly to get into medical school but<br>also the other health um the health<br>fields and Dan coordinated has<br>coordinated and continues to contribute<br>to that course for many many years<br>during um and this is an example of the<br>passing on the Knowledge and Skills that<br>are necessary to make impact on<br>health and interestingly this is a major<br>teaching role in the in the in the<br>school he was told um when he was at<br>high school by the school counselor that<br>he should be a<br>teacher um and his reply was well you<br>have to like children to be a<br>teacher and so I guess the children are<br>older and potentially on the way to<br>being adults um but he is a very good<br>teacher and um he moves those students<br>they talk about that course for the rest<br>of their careers wherever they go they<br>understand Equity fairness in its<br>broadest sense um the incidentally the<br>time of peak 111 lecturing and setting<br>exams is the same time is the guavas<br>ripen I don't know how many people<br>around the school have been uh been the<br>wonderful beneficiaries of Dan's<br>preserves and maybe Heather as well uh<br>preserves and other baking items they<br>they really enrich our lives and uh<br>provide us with necessary distractions<br>I'm sure from the 111 work which was<br>going on at the time so Dan is a very<br>well-known locally nationally and Inter<br>internationally and the school of<br>population health is known for doing the<br>ward rounds so this is where you pop<br>around and just say hello to people and<br>while it takes up a little bit of time<br>it actually is an excellent opportunity<br>to get your message to the now academic<br>director in a timely manner and also for<br>him to remind you about something that<br>you haven't done so the ward rounds I I<br>highly recommend that technique so Dan<br>maintains links with colleagues at<br>University of St Andrews and Edinburgh<br>and uh and Edinburgh in Scotland and<br>Leeds in England he's also traveled<br>widely to to present his work with many<br>different folks the first accommodation<br>he had in Scotland uh was University<br>accommodation and it was described to<br>him as a formal council a former Council<br>house and so of course that engendered<br>visions of the council housing you see<br>on TV from the<br>1980s however it was completely<br>different than that it did have mustard<br>yellow carpet and Paisley curtains but<br>it was in a block of 50 Flats over three<br>fours so six plats Flats per staircase<br>two on each side and three stories high<br>but then a Terrace connected to another<br>lot it was something new to the lad from<br>AA but it must have worked out okay<br>because hither decided to stay with<br>you Dan's work on deprivation indices is<br>World leading and has moved the way our<br>government thinks about deprivation it's<br>moov the way researchers think about<br>deprivation and he's even created one<br>with for older people which is dear to<br>my own<br>heart at home Dan has been increasingly<br>influential in the school the faculty<br>and the university with many roles<br>including the long-term faculty<br>education committee for a long-standing<br>contribution when I was head of school I<br>was a bit instrumental in enabling Dan<br>to take on the post of the postgrad lead<br>for the school perhaps he was a little<br>reluctant at the time I'm sure he'll<br>tell you about that but he did a great<br>job and has now gone on to lead the<br>academic de development of the school<br>the CFT whatever that means curriculum<br>framework transformation and and as<br>academic director and now working with<br>the faculty so I'll finish soon because<br>we've got to get on with the real Joy<br>which is listening to Dan I just want to<br>read you some a list of awards so he's<br>had the butland teaching research award<br>for innovation in 2020 the New Zealand<br>spatial Excellence award for people and<br>communities in 2018 and the ja mayor<br>Award for best doctoral thesis among the<br>association of American geographers<br>medical geography group in 20 2005 so<br>he's been awarded through the me through<br>the breadth of academic work from<br>teaching to research and also now<br>service so in conclusion Professor<br>Daniel John Exodus Journey exemplifies<br>Excellence Innovation and a commitment<br>to equity in advancing health research<br>we see the current impact and look<br>forward to continued impact on everyday<br>lives of new zealanders in his role as<br>professor as Professor please join me<br>and welcoming Professor exodor to the<br>Kingdom no<br>tamim<br>Barry Co Christin<br>AK Melissa<br>thank you war and thank you Nar for the<br>I'll say kind words some of that<br>detective work I can zoom through about<br>10 slides now cuz you've already heard<br>the introduction from n so it's always a<br>risk but hey it was a well it was a well<br>bit<br>one before I begin I'd really like to<br>say thank you<br>as I look around the<br>room at you the audience you are what I<br>Aspire the university to look<br>like people from all walks of life<br>sitting alongside University staff those<br>University staff not categorized by rank<br>not divided by status like academic or<br>professional clinical or<br>non-clinical staff not in different<br>faculties fighting for funding but here<br>at the<br>University to make the space a better<br>place for everybody to live<br>in<br>so I thank you I thank you so much for<br>coming and I'm just blowing away that<br>you could take a bit of time out to<br>celebrate this talk so here we go most<br>of you will know my wife hither and as I<br>was writing this talk she said just<br>explain it to the people who aren't<br>usually hear that it's just like a<br>eulogy but for somebody who's<br>alive so here you go you've got you<br>don't know how old I am but I'm going to<br>cover some of that while I go through so<br>anyway so here we are as I celebrate my<br>achievements to comeing to Professor I<br>also recognize that it's not just my own<br>work that got me here my students my<br>colleagues my friends<br>myano<br>hether we got here<br>here I'm a health geographer I'm a<br>spatial epidemiologist I'm a big data<br>person careful how you emphasize those<br>three<br>words and my work is using big data and<br>geographic information to tell a story<br>about social justice so we can inform<br>policy and make<br>change I just Begin by giving a little<br>bit of a warning that some of the work<br>that I do discuss tonight does result uh<br>does focus on some of the suicide<br>research that I have and so just a heads<br>up I know that might resonate with some<br>of you in the<br>class sorry<br>class it's a room it's a class we have<br>one class all<br>righty so I guess you could argue that<br>my interest in health here and the role<br>of geography has on health came from a<br>really really young age my mom and the<br>doctors knew that I was going to be<br>quite a bit of difficulty at Birth and<br>when Mom went into labor and called the<br>ambulance the ambulance went to the<br>closest hospital not the most<br>appropriate<br>one so essentially the upshot of that<br>was that I was born dead I was moved to<br>another hospital and stayed in an<br>so and I joked to one of my friends that<br>you know I was born blue it sucked the<br>light out of me and I've been R ever<br>since so there you go um but Jokes Aside<br>so there we<br>go<br>um I guess that's one of the first<br>Lessons Learned don't tell me I can't do<br>something don't laugh at one of my ideas<br>cuz I'll just dig in and I'll do my dest<br>to<br>succeed hether would just say I'm just<br>plain<br>stubborn life at home as a child was<br>fantastic with mom Christine dad Barry<br>and Melissa my sister we were a really<br>close-nit family and lived the life out<br>west my big sister Melissa lissy was<br>really protective of me<br>immensely and so you know as a youngster<br>partially crosseyed with a brown Fury oh<br>helps if we've got these photos then we<br>can all laugh okay so with the brown<br>Fury face birth mark you can imagine<br>some of the names that I was getting<br>called at school so many are lunchtime<br>at glendine primary school I think<br>Melissa's got memories of dealing with<br>mercy again I don't think I ever said<br>thanks<br>Mom and Dad provided unconditional love<br>and support for everything that I wanted<br>to do even though they knew that I was<br>going to be absolutely useless at it but<br>hey the kid's got to<br>try dad was a life member at the<br>softball club or is a life member at the<br>softball club and much of our youth was<br>running around the parks and having just<br>great<br>times I think I learned some of my<br>resilience there when I was watching dad<br>coaching and he knew that he was right<br>and the Umpire might have been wrong but<br>that's that's that unequal power right<br>the Umpire can say he wins in the end<br>and sometimes dad got ejected but you<br>know resilience I can't get rejected<br>from here just tonight so that's all<br>good we moved to Mount Albert when I was<br>about 11 years old and I went to marelin<br>intermediate uh marelin college for<br>intermediate I was meant to go there for<br>my uh high school years but walking<br>through the short I took a shortcut<br>through man Albert grammar one day about<br>10 days before school school for third<br>form and I bumped into the principal of<br>Mount Albert grammar school well I had a<br>couple of words to say to him and we<br>asked a couple of questions and I went<br>away and did my shopping and got home<br>and told Mom and Dad hey we've got a<br>9:00 meeting with the principal at Mount<br>abber grar and so we went to manab at<br>grammar school during my ba here at the<br>University of Oakland I did a geography<br>and ancient history degree and like many<br>of my peers of that decade I also worked<br>at<br>somewhere just recognizing some people<br>who are influential to the social<br>justice way my n and Granddad Jack and<br>Margaret and the um together<br>here whenever we were kids we had go to<br>n and grandads and they they had a deep<br>Christian faith and they were always<br>handing out Parcels or going to collect<br>food or do something with the community<br>so much so that we joked that we were<br>going to visit St Vincent<br>saton Heather's mom up there telling<br>Helen Clark what's<br>what was also like Ken who hasband<br>passionate about their own faith and<br>deeply faithful as well they lived their<br>social justice rout they had a much<br>bigger diary much more activity in their<br>diary than we did when they were in<br>their 70s and we were leaving to go over<br>to Scotland so I'm not quite sure how<br>that worked Ken for his sins a scientist<br>geoscientist said that like what are you<br>going to do when you grow up doing your<br>PhD and I said well I'm going to do<br>geovisualization no no you you have to<br>do stats you have to do stats it's going<br>to take you much better if you know how<br>to talk to Stats you can make an impact<br>in the work that you're doing I'm like H<br>okay so there we go um with a little bit<br>of like hurrying along and as my uh<br>esteemed colleague said I failed stats<br>at high school so so there we go I had<br>to do a bit of an inroad but here we are<br>we did some stats and I did your<br>visualization and the best of both<br>things Heather's mom was amazing she<br>volunteered throughout her life in many<br>different<br>organizations and one one thing about my<br>my work she she wasn't really fully<br>aware of what I was doing I worked at<br>the<br>University a congregation at church one<br>day she did tell to one of her members<br>of the<br>congregation my son-in-law does Research<br>what which is<br>like kind of the merging of deprivation<br>and poverty which are the two things<br>that I do do so you know conjunctions<br>might have been a thing that we needed<br>to retach her my first foray into<br>epidemiology was in 1997 as a student<br>and ockland was going through their<br>measles epidemic well Oakland Public<br>Health knew how to do the classic<br>epidemic wave and curves that we've seen<br>recently<br>but mapping wasn't in their wellhouse so<br>they asked for some advice at the time I<br>had my Master's uh supervisor and he's<br>thought we need to do something so I<br>jumped into uh doing some spatial<br>epidemiology and before I get into my<br>masters it would be remiss of me to talk<br>about medical geography or spatial<br>epidemiology without reference to the<br>Broad Street pump and Jon Snow for those<br>of you who are thinking about Jon Snow<br>this isn't the Game of Thrones this is<br>isn't the channel 4 news reader this is<br>the older older older guy in the 1850s<br>who was a physician who was mapping the<br>incidents of cola in his<br>location he marked a little black dot<br>next to where the households were that<br>disease was happening and he could see<br>that there was quite a cluster happening<br>close to the Broad Street pump which was<br>one of the water pumps that people get<br>get their Town Supply<br>from so he walked up and removed that<br>brown uh the Broad Street pump and then<br>slow the incidents of cases around that<br>place started to subside now<br>epidemiologists will argue whether it<br>was really happening or not but for this<br>case if nothing else he identified that<br>it was indeed a waterborne<br>illness onto my masters I was looking at<br>doing two parts of my project I never<br>did anything by half so I went all<br>in for my ma I did two parts I modeled<br>the spread of disease and I decided to<br>do that using a road network using this<br>little scario we made some maps and yes<br>they absolutely look hideous but for<br>those in the room who know what argis<br>and AR plot and AR editor you know what<br>I'm talking about these are pretty<br>good so we used those techniques and we<br>did a survey and we created a framework<br>to help the people at Oakland Public<br>Health and further of field to<br>understand what they wanted to show and<br>how best to communicate that using this<br>disease<br>framework after my masters I got a job<br>working for Oakland public health and<br>this is what our colleague Chris Bolan<br>says is A $64 million map It's A $64<br>million map because it showed really<br>clearly the association between the red<br>dots the manager cocko cases and<br>household overcrowding in South<br>Oakland this map was used at a street<br>level to intervene and identify where<br>places need to go uh where the workers<br>need to go to immunize people along the<br>way but it'll also set the standard and<br>part of The Narrative of why people<br>needed bigger houses bigger State houses<br>in South Oakland because the household<br>composition wasn't just your new your<br>kids I forgot to mention that my masters<br>was by uh supervised by pip for and he<br>got me working on some some work with<br>the then very new nzed de<br>1996 he was working with a colleague<br>from<br>titoo and she got me to do these maps<br>and I had to present them so as a fresh<br>grad you know 20 something I was<br>presenting this these maps and you know<br>if anybody knew Judy you'd know that<br>that Judy was a a pretty fierce fighter<br>and so I said she suffered no<br>fools so she said what's happening here<br>with that dot in the middle that's<br>that's yellow what's happening in<br>deprivation in this place and I like<br>Well ma'am if you'd like to look at the<br>legend the red down the bottom says that<br>it's bright red it's the 10% most<br>deprived areas of the whole country hm<br>what about this point she pointed to<br>another point on the green on the map<br>that's red too what's driving<br>deprivation there I'm like well if you<br>look at the map so by the third time I<br>said this I can assure you she was not<br>very very happy but it did get the cogs<br>we thinking about how we could look at<br>deprivation and how could how we could<br>tell a<br>story so with Pip we started on a<br>project what we called visualizing<br>Landscapes of deprivation and in part<br>this was about how to lie with maps 101<br>we had some data sets we could group it<br>and and show different Maps so if we<br>wanted to we could predict or or prepare<br>a map that showed that Oakland was<br>really really deprived with the bright<br>red in the top left in the middle there<br>or very not really deprived in the<br>bottom right we looked at population<br>cagrs to distort the importance of place<br>so that we focus our eye on where people<br>were rather than people weren't which<br>was a problem with the CH map at the B<br>him and of course anybody who knew pip<br>knew that he was a bit of<br>a think outside the box kind of person<br>so here we used Chun off faces and and<br>ascribed data from the Census to<br>represent the different elements of the<br>NZ dep at the time so that we could map<br>the data and we could see side by side<br>there's two blue areas and those faces<br>mapped very very differently when we<br>looked at the different profiles of the<br>deprivation and I I think this is a<br>really good learning about how we do<br>things and one thing that I learned for<br>my masters just because there's a common<br>way to do things or a preferred way to<br>do things doesn't mean there's other<br>ways that we can't that that we have to<br>explore go out use your use your<br>opportunities and and think<br>broadly imagine if we had dessert with<br>only vanilla ice cream how boring would<br>that<br>be so I came back after working with<br>perp and with Chris I came back to work<br>with uh toor kelstrom at Community<br>Health doing some environmental mapping<br>and I bumped into this guy called Adrian<br>field and he was working for<br>afro so we got talking and he said oh<br>you you need to come and talk to um<br>Karen she's working on this project and<br>so we developed the community resource<br>accessibility index the cray for<br>short for this I had to get 36 data<br>types but we didn't have web scraping we<br>didn't have Google<br>we had the Yellow Pages we had White<br>Pages we had the phone can you just<br>confirm that this is the right address<br>okay right okay then we had to geocode<br>it then we had to map it and we left<br>this map running for 5 days over<br>Christmas so that we could get the<br>results and hope like mad that we<br>actually got those results when we came<br>back from the Christmas<br>break it worked but nowadays we could do<br>that for the whole country with more<br>data scraping data off the internet and<br>the whole process we could probably do<br>in about four or 5 hours which is just<br>phenomenal at this point I also have to<br>acknowledge not only Adrien and Karen<br>but also Sally Caswell Jan Sharon and<br>Lisa Morris because if it wasn't for<br>Adrien I wouldn't be going upstairs to<br>see afro and I certainly wouldn't have<br>met hither so um well my life was kind<br>of the rest of my life has been with<br>Heather so there you<br>go pip was really really fantastic as a<br>mentor frustrating as a supervisor CU<br>he' never give you a right answer like<br>do we do this or do we this well Dan if<br>you wanted to do this you should do but<br>if you wanted to do this nevertheless he<br>was a fantastic mentor and recommended<br>that I travel the Seas look for<br>somewhere else and and broaden my<br>Geographic understandings and go<br>overseas to do my<br>research so from an Oakland kid who knew<br>Oakland a lot you can imagine that when<br>we first saw the map of St Andrews with<br>three Main Street thinking what on Earth<br>have we moved to where is St Andrews<br>like we've heard of Edinburgh and maybe<br>dande but where on Earth is<br>this so most people will know St Andrews<br>as the home of golf well about a day<br>before we went to do the reconnaissance<br>mission to meet the team at St Andrews<br>somebody else announced that they were<br>going to go to St Andrews as<br>well which was really really cool<br>because he did do ography and he was<br>always uh he was living just across the<br>way from us and he had this sort of<br>really pass like understanding so please<br>tell me minda what do we mean about this<br>Anthrax gear do I need to worry about it<br>I mean just this whole different life<br>that we lived in St Andrews for us it<br>just meant that our rent went up about<br>$150 a month<br>overnight so I went and did my my PhD<br>with Paul here at um in the top photo<br>and with Robin flow through powerhouses<br>and human geography and population<br>studies and my PhD was about the small<br>area analysis of of really understanding<br>that Scottish mortality gap for the<br>students who are going through their<br>pyrs or their confirmation years this<br>was actually about option 15 I gave to<br>the supervisors in the end I went well<br>you tell me what you want me to do<br>because I've already decided that you<br>you don't want to like you're not<br>listening to what I want to do and so<br>this was one that we settled on I<br>developed the consistent areas through<br>time which which was a different way of<br>thinking about how we can do population<br>geography where we had different census<br>areas they overlap to do stuff in GIS<br>but when they overlap we say well well<br>is is Zone one 80 20 75 25 all this<br>population estimation I told you I<br>failed stats I did it the easy way I sum<br>them up by merging the data together so<br>the super zones meant that also every<br>household was in the same census zone<br>for three census periods so that we<br>could do some analysis without any<br>issues around geography which is really<br>really important and it's one of the<br>things that I find really really<br>interesting in terms of epidemiology<br>that we control for age and sex and<br>ethnicity deprivation but we never worry<br>about the underlying spatial patterns<br>that we we're zoning and and geography<br>can have a massive<br>impact one of my first Publications for<br>my PhD was looking at suicide among<br>young adults between that period 19 1981<br>and 2001 with a couple of years around<br>it this was a really really good<br>opportunity for me<br>um there were three learnings for me at<br>this point first of all Paul was an<br>amazing supervisor and at one of the um<br>the at Krogan which I know I saw um<br>Janine in the room I hated kronin it was<br>a 3 or 4 day residential training for<br>all postgrads who are doing geog rhy in<br>uh Scotland at the time and we're<br>talking about ethics and qualitative<br>methods and things I'm like um I'm doing<br>an analysis of dead people I can't do a<br>sance like how do I do my methods and so<br>in this particular case Paul also uh<br>this this Gap showed that mortality was<br>much higher among the most deprived and<br>it had widened between 1981 and<br>2001 and<br>Paul a couple of other lessons that I<br>learned from Paul when we submitted this<br>to the bmj the British medical journal<br>we aspir to the top<br>Publications and and this was it this<br>was like now what well Paul also and at<br>to us Krogan to write a list of all the<br>different places that we wanted to see<br>our Papers written in over the course of<br>our<br>career Paul also suggested that surely<br>the esteemed bmj wouldn't want a PhD<br>student to be submitting this<br>information probably be much better<br>regarded if it had come from a professor<br>so hence this is exitor after boil and<br>before flower Jew so another lesson<br>stand up to these challenges if your<br>sort of Supervisors trying to discuss<br>these things if it's your PhD research<br>yours we also did a whole of population<br>study looking at the suicide cases in<br>Scotland and again one of the learnings<br>here was that for me personally I have<br>to step back and remember that the<br>statistics that I'm talking about are<br>people people who have died and people<br>who have left Family behind grieving so<br>not withstanding the significance of<br>what we've seen and what we<br>study I do believe that the research<br>that we're doing towards understanding<br>the drivers of uh inequities and indeed<br>and and the risk factors for suicide<br>needs to<br>continue the map here on the right shows<br>some of the study that we did that<br>looked at the whole of the cases of<br>Scotland and said we abouts do suicides<br>cluster across the whole of the country<br>using a whole of population study<br>previously the universal definition for<br>suicide clusters was a copycat event<br>similar cases occurring in a similar um<br>similar fashion and and Clos in<br>proximity to time or space and it was<br>also focused on the highlands and<br>Islands in Scotland with these two<br>papers the the suicide clusters and uh<br>the more deprived situation for the bmj<br>paper these informed the Scottish<br>Executives uh policies the prevention<br>plan for suicide prevention to focus on<br>low socioeconomic populations as well as<br>deprived areas so that we could try and<br>improve um those risk factors this is my<br>list that I wrote and it's been slightly<br>reordered so that I could say when I<br>first published them um and so yeah<br>there's a few gaps there that I need to<br>fill in things like transactions or<br>progress in human geography population<br>space in place so if you've got some<br>time and you've got some ideas come and<br>give me a<br>call graduation is always quite a a<br>special event and in in St Andrews it's<br>a little bit different where you kneel<br>before the chancellor to get your cat<br>and then the hood comes over your head<br>um as you can see here the by the<br>ballist doing that on me it was an<br>amazing event and technically I crossed<br>the stage before this uh before oh it's<br>gone he didn't he wasn't there William<br>'s gone I don't know where he's gone<br>anyway so I had told hither and my Foo<br>to meet outside at a particular place<br>which all the congregation were walking<br>past yep yep yep we'll do that my best<br>friend HH who I've known since I was 3<br>years old was there he found me hey how<br>you doing congratulations I saw the<br>Queen's little lemon hat Bob past and<br>the the official University party like<br>Oh They'll be here soon they'll be hello<br>Heather who was sitting right next to<br>the Royal party with Mom and Dad close<br>by followed the Royal party out of the<br>camp graduation for about 45 minutes<br>into the secured space for the<br>University to meet with the royal family<br>while our friends were well my my my<br>graduation friends but also my mate hus<br>was like where are they where are they<br>so they got unreal photos of well<br>unbelievable photos um like this one<br>where Dad's saying right you've got your<br>graduation you've got 6 months then you<br>got a start paying rent or at least find<br>a<br>job that sort of competition right the<br>best photos from graduation they're just<br>not of<br>me so we did have some official photos<br>the four of us left up on the top right<br>and then uh we did have to have a few<br>photos as you can see outside our flat<br>um a few days before Mom and Dad left<br>one of my learnings here around cystic<br>fibrosis was that I did a study with<br>Paul as a postto and for the cystic<br>fibrosis team they wanted to find p<br>patterns they thought that there was<br>going to be uh a social gradient and<br>they were asking so many questions when<br>we said this is there's no association<br>the cystic fi surely there is go and go<br>and find one can you do something what<br>else have you done what do something<br>find it more find another statistician<br>gladly so I did um but one of the things<br>that I walked away from this particular<br>study was because the board members of<br>the cystic fibrosis trust had the power<br>of veto over your research so if you<br>didn't if they if you presented your<br>work whether it was like this or in a<br>publication you had to submit it to the<br>board a couple of weeks before they'd<br>read it they'd give you some feedback<br>but they also had the power of veto if<br>you didn't if they didn't like what you<br>were presenting they could say<br>potentially don't present it so again<br>one of those lessons walk away and keep<br>your head high if you've got strong<br>morals keep keep your ethics strong and<br>stand by them so we came back to the<br>school of population Health in 20 in<br>2005 we' always committed that if<br>anything had happened to one of our<br>family members would' come back in a<br>flash in the middle of 2005 Heather's<br>dad got a mysterious respiratory illness<br>it was 2005 it wasn't 2019 wasn't Co I<br>did ask either if it was Co 5 but she<br>said<br>no we came<br>home um and I touched base with Rod<br>Jackson who I'd met with my days down in<br>tour down in community<br>health and then uh the then head of<br>school aliser Woodward gave me a space<br>to work for a month which was fantastic<br>um we went back to Scotland and we came<br>back later in the year after we found<br>out that uh Ken had been diagnosed with<br>M neuron disease in December that year I<br>also uh interviewed for a lectureship in<br>population Health triple one and the<br>inevitable question well<br>you're well it doesn't matter if it was<br>nine people on 900 so long as the<br>content's engaging and you know I'm a<br>good lecturer surely it shouldn't matter<br>OMG what a difference it makes when you<br>come to the reality of teaching a large<br>lecture theater for those of you in this<br>class this is about 250 students<br>population health is double this and one<br>of our lecture theaters is double this<br>alone so um this is where I started<br>working with uh rod and then we've had a<br>few changes as a guard in the team I<br>think Rini is here and I've seen Dennis<br>here as well tonight so um this is our<br>team po Health triple one um yes it has<br>been a massive undertaking when I took<br>over as course director from Rod it also<br>gave me the opportunity to to meet so<br>many people across the faculty I saw<br>this has been one of the well the<br>Gateway into the medical and Health<br>Sciences programs in many ways so it<br>allowed me to get enduring Pro um<br>relationships with the likes of the<br>School of Pharmacy with people in<br>medicine with nursing and throughout so<br>um I'm very privileged to have those<br>relationships my teaching focuses on<br>social determinance of Health for what<br>we teach first years as the causes of<br>the causes of disease we know that<br>smoking causes lung cancer but what<br>causes people to smoke it could be a<br>whole number of different things and the<br>aim for the research for our teaching is<br>not to say oh those those poor people or<br>that person this person does that or<br>that household we go back to my house<br>geography roots in some part and start<br>thinking about the micro the Miso and<br>the macro scale what are the Upstream<br>determinants that might be policy<br>changes or or regulations that we could<br>change rather than saying oh that bad<br>person they really shouldn't smoke let's<br>Upstream in in now uh in the political<br>climate at the moment in particular<br>you'll hear we should be voting we<br>should be looking for equality in<br>outcomes equality of opportunities and<br>outcomes well from an equality<br>perspective from a population Health<br>perspective equality is is giving<br>everybody the<br>same so in this particular case<br>everybody gets a 10-speed<br>bike it doesn't matter if you're unable<br>to ride a 10-speed bike because you're<br>too short or Too Tall or you're uh spend<br>your life on a wheelchair living with<br>disabilities however Equity is changing<br>the response so that it's fit for<br>purpose for all<br>people so when we're talking about<br>equality and equity I drive people<br>towards that Equity Focus as much as I<br>can from a geographer perspective that<br>spatial Equity comes into place when we<br>look at maps and say is it really a good<br>thing that some parts of Oakland have<br>you know maybe an inundation of vaping<br>stores of tobacco stores good access to<br>gambling Outlets all of these things and<br>then we could maybe go for a drive 10<br>minutes down the road and find none<br>when we're thinking about the equity we<br>also need to look at where they are on<br>the map and what some of those drivers<br>can<br>be not all of our<br>Innovations make sense are seen in front<br>of the classroom and so in a class of a<br>thousand students you might expect you<br>know some variation so it might be very<br>possible that this guy who's also Dan<br>exitor turns up to a test when this Dan<br>exitor should be sitting the test and<br>might do the test test if he did the<br>test he'd probably do a lot better cuz<br>he's the sports med doctor and I'm the<br>Epi bio so if you're looking if you<br>you're wondering why I've got I bio in<br>the background he's the reason<br>why but I was talking to the exams<br>manager at the time and said we we've<br>got the situation how do we know that<br>Dan exitor is really doing the test and<br>it's the right Dan exitor and so we<br>decided on a barcode scanning tool and I<br>worked with a good friend of ours and<br>and a professional staff member Chris<br>J and she was a computer science<br>scientist she was a fantastic teaching<br>admin person but we leveraged that<br>computer science skill and this was a<br>part-time project for her in the<br>background where she worked on this and<br>I think the learning for us here as<br>academics sometimes we look over our<br>professional staff and we say oh that's<br>our gsse they do this or they do that<br>they come with a heap of capability and<br>skills that we should be<br>leveraging and for her um for her work<br>on this Chris actually won a<br>professional staff Ward as well so well<br>done Chris if you're here I came back<br>into the research space and this is<br>where I thank you all I know many of you<br>have been emailing me over the last 20<br>or so years going damn we've just got<br>this data and I want to in dip it now I<br>respond and go no you don't you want to<br>IMD it but I can give you in dip as well<br>alternatively it's the other colleagues<br>in the room who I'm working with as a<br>named investigator on a much longer<br>project this is where I say thank you to<br>you because without your Publications<br>without your science and allowing medic<br>to collaborate with you I wouldn't be<br>here right<br>now so you know that old adage that<br>geology rocks and geography is all over<br>the<br>place well these are some of the uh this<br>word cloud is some of the things that<br>I've done over the past 20 years or so<br>where of influence change if you like<br>it's not just about health and social<br>factors but it's also a range of<br>different um different projects as<br>well and this is um I hope I've got you<br>all in here apologies if you're not here<br>but my col my collaboration network is<br>wide and I think this is also um I guess<br>part of my granddad who again whenever<br>we'd go to him would' say oh we need a<br>new battery for the car or something oh<br>well go and see Jim he thought you out<br>you know all those kind of stories it's<br>about linking and staying linked and<br>with one of the other learnings I had<br>was talk to people about anything and<br>you find out the most interesting things<br>a story this paper came from a master<br>student who was actually looking uh I'll<br>go<br>back we had a tree expert come and visit<br>our house giving us some guidance on<br>some of the Native planting that we<br>should be putting in our backyard we got<br>talking about me being at Uni and he<br>being in an environmental scientist and<br>he said oh you should see how much<br>byproduct of of meth production is just<br>dumped in the whiteaker ranges it's<br>Insidious we need to do something about<br>it so that conversation started another<br>Cog turning and uh we got some data from<br>the New Zealand Police and it was some<br>very very specific data about where the<br>clandestine Labs were located and um so<br>we looked for the geospatial patterns<br>but the learning here again is to not so<br>much about the geospatial results but<br>also have those conversations and and<br>learn and there's often so much to learn<br>from some of our least expected um<br>communities this was a great Masters<br>project the other learning here was that<br>the data environment changes so<br>quickly a few years after we did this<br>project we wanted to update it and the<br>New Zealand Police said um know our data<br>protocols have changed could you please<br>put in an oia request and get an<br>official Information Act request<br>so that changed their data protocols um<br>we just didn't do another<br>publication when I came back I was<br>fortunate enough I see Helen in the room<br>here as an emerging researcher from the<br>HIC looking at immunization coverage and<br>and looking at disparities across the<br>country that was a great project but as<br>I was writing this I remembered this was<br>also interrupted in 2009 with another<br>pandemic of of um a in flu so that kind<br>of skewed out influenza and other sort<br>of uh immunization patterns quite a lot<br>but I flagged this one as well because<br>big farmer were really really interested<br>in our results so much so that they're<br>kind of gearing me towards a a space<br>that I didn't really feel comfortable in<br>they're kind of trying to change the<br>language a little bit and and use the<br>results in their way bit like those<br>directors were doing in the CF database<br>so um I stepped away from that<br>opportunity as well and and held my my<br>morals<br>High soon after I got a project from the<br>Oakland Medical Research Foundation and<br>and I've had great success with them and<br>I think if Denise is in the room um I<br>owe you a a sense of gratitude as well<br>you were the one who kicked me off to go<br>and do all of these different Grant<br>applications and and great stuff at the<br>time the rumor was that amrf doesn't do<br>population health research<br>they do they found good research I just<br>had to learn how to write to the<br>criteria and I was very fortunate I put<br>the map up here because it was about<br>local variations and it was also well<br>there's three District Health boards to<br>do vascular Atlas we couldn't really<br>show much variation between ockland whak<br>and middlemore uh counties Monaco so we<br>used the electorate this is one of the<br>first maps that I used the electral<br>boundaries for um to show some variation<br>they're great they've got roughly 65 or<br>70,000 people they're broadly<br>understandable and most important<br>they've got Representatives that we vote<br>in they're our<br>employees so we can use the Electoral<br>boundaries to actually say this is going<br>well or this isn't going well and make<br>that opportunity to work with the MPS to<br>hold them accountable and see what we<br>can make how we can make change going<br>I got I got that buag for deprivation<br>again I needed to go and and revisit<br>that that understanding and so we with a<br>great team uh Sue kingle who's now in in<br>Vago I don't think that's an indication<br>of my working relationship with her work<br>with Dan and move to possibly as far<br>away as possible Michael Brown Jin frong<br>Jin fou and ARA Lee we created the NZ de<br>how many times have I seen that happen<br>not generally by myself so we developed<br>the IMD largely built on some Scottish<br>research we could show the overall<br>picture of deprivation but we could also<br>break it down into different pillars so<br>access this was a huge undertaking and<br>we worked with communities we talked to<br>ewi we talked to government agencies<br>then we talked to anybody who wanted to<br>listen to us who could provide us<br>information about what the measures we<br>wanted to capture to ensure that we were<br>doing what we needed to<br>do it was an immensely massive project<br>and I'm super proud that we as a team<br>got the uh spatial Excellence award as<br>an I mentioned for uh for the University<br>but also for the work on people and<br>communities part of the base that we did<br>for the um the project was about<br>developing data zones and this is kind<br>of like Goldilocks in the Three Bears<br>mes block too small we can't get any<br>information census areas too big way too<br>much variation so we settled on<br>neighborhoods that we called Data zones<br>which was a huge undertaking but the<br>learning here was when we went to Stats<br>New Zealand we said we've got a million<br>dollar Grant to do this research we've<br>got these zones that you could use for<br>all of this research and we can show you<br>how it's been used in the<br>UK<br>disappointingly the manager at Stats New<br>Zealand said I'm really sorry we've got<br>a statistical review in 2 years time can<br>you back then and so when we went back<br>they still didn't want them and their<br>mainstream is is lost so I guess the<br>learning is um you know keep doing what<br>you can and um try and go higher up and<br>and seeing who you're talking to in that<br>space so this is my response to the kuer<br>from 1990s when I was saying what's<br>driving deprivation here we've got two<br>map uh two places showing in the in<br>purple here and the line plot on the<br>bottom uh left hand side is showing the<br>rank of deprivation overall but also for<br>each of the seven domains and the higher<br>the level of the the line the more<br>deprived the community is so we could<br>see that even though they were categor<br>categorized as quinti 5 they also had<br>much variation in terms of crime or<br>housing and health and in fact swapped<br>over in terms of<br>access I've got an enduring uh working<br>relationship now with the amazing team<br>at uh the center for E research because<br>I distribute did a whole lot of work<br>with um a<br>report to all of the CEOs of the<br>District Health boards and said this is<br>our new product this is your deprivation<br>profile this is your demographic profile<br>and one came back and said this is<br>amazing but we've actually got five<br>different territorial authorities that<br>are in our in our um Health Board can we<br>have one of them as well for all of<br>those I like well with funds drying up<br>we needed to find a solution so I went<br>knocking to the Center for e research<br>and whenever I've gone with very random<br>questions ever since they could be<br>like any random question that I could<br>ask them they've always come and said<br>yes sure do you mean something like this<br>and so that relationship has been<br>awesome whenever I found the center for<br>e- research we can collaborate and keep<br>working and so um many thanks to that<br>collaboration we could produce reports<br>by elector by um any different type type<br>of geography that you want and you could<br>provide a different response uh for<br>different levels of<br>geography when we wanted to get spatial<br>Justice in action we really need to talk<br>with Community groups and so i' done a<br>presentation about the IMD to alcohol<br>and and um drug researchers who are<br>Advocates about alcohol licensing and so<br>that started another collaboration and<br>we created another report which<br>basically means that with these four<br>steps you go into our imdm website which<br>is the one that uh the center for E<br>research has developed you can search<br>for an address and this is a previous<br>example from uh tipie down in Christ<br>Church and you could click the local<br>alcohol report and you get a PDF with<br>about six or seven pages and it tells<br>you within 2 km of your uh proposed<br>address what's happening in terms of<br>deprivation in terms of ethnic Pro uh<br>population terms of age structure and so<br>forth and so massive Mah's gone behind<br>this and I think it's a fantastic tool<br>to get out there um not wanting to favor<br>any of my Master's students or PhD<br>students pointing them out but this<br>serves a purpose hopefully it's going to<br>play um this shiny app actually allows<br>you to look at the licensing trusts out<br>west we pay a little bit more for our<br>alcohol but those funds go back into the<br>community for things like sporting kit<br>or maybe um smoke alarms or anything<br>anything for the<br>home but this allowed Us in this<br>particular shiny app to say actually<br>what would happen if we removed access<br>to the alcohol outlets on a number of<br>controls such as within a kilometer of a<br>school or a kilometer of a marai or even<br>having a distance of between 500 M<br>between another alcohol Outlet what<br>would that do in terms of not only the<br>overall picture here on the left with<br>the deprivation pattern but we also<br>broke it down to show<br>that the reduction and inequities would<br>be um significant as well so a great<br>little advert here I think for the BSC<br>on these Master students are amazing uh<br>these honor students and it's my<br>them we finished the IMD and we went<br>down to Peter krampton who developed NZ<br>and we said hey we want to write a paper<br>with you and say we've got these two<br>indices they could work well Wy use them<br>and said oh let me consult with my team<br>and came back a few days later and said<br>I've consulted with my team we want to<br>do a little bit more<br>work unfortunately Peter and his team<br>didn't come back to us and publish the<br>paper um in cou which is a New Zealand<br>journal and the upshot was there's a few<br>discrepancies there between what we<br>would have put in for the IMD and so<br>forth But ultimately the thing that kind<br>kind of really really disappointed me<br>here was that we put our hand out to<br>collaborate and they closed us down and<br>then I guess it's a little bit of a<br>little bit of a bit of sweet statement<br>here is that in their disclosure<br>statement they said they had no<br>conflicts of<br>interest I think it's a little bit like<br>going through customs when you come in<br>from overseas if you declare it you're<br>not going to get fine for it so I'm not<br>going to go and Sue anybody but if<br>you're thinking about research and you<br>think you might have something to<br>disclose disclose that conflict because<br>it's better to have two many then to not<br>have none uh to not advertise that you<br>have<br>them I was fortunate enough to be at the<br>the bleeding edge as we say slightly<br>ahead of time we were doing some work<br>with uh Car Carmel Williams here looking<br>at keeping<br>um I guess keeping the government uh<br>honest keeping their monitoring the mon<br>the government's Behavior here but this<br>paper was really focused on SGS and one<br>of the sustainable development goals<br>that New Zealand's committed to<br>achieving before we as an institution<br>and indeed other institutions got behind<br>it and started using that as a tool to<br>to reference so Na's already mentioned<br>one of the groups that we missed in in<br>our uh deprivation analyses blatantly<br>obviously was the population aged over 6<br>5 deprivation indices focus on the<br>working age<br>population so we had a great student who<br>had a really simple<br>question can we use the Census Data to<br>create a socioeconomic position for the<br>whole of the population aged over 65 and<br>in fact if you ask a couple of questions<br>about uh housing tenure and maybe uh<br>Investments and type of accommodation<br>and any other supplements that you might<br>be receiving you can and you get a<br>really good measure a simple measure of<br>low socioeconomic low medium or high<br>socioeconomic position for the 65 and<br>above we also did a more complex OPI IMD<br>calculator which had 15 questions that<br>are basically here yes or no yes or no<br>yes or no going through this list and it<br>will determine a deprivation score for<br>you<br>again data Landscapes changing and<br>unfortunately one of the best tools that<br>we could have used in this is the<br>interide data but again we're a little<br>bit ahead of time and that wasn't<br>available in the IDI when we were using<br>it this is another paper that we<br>published a little bit ahead of time I<br>feel where there's a spatial Justice<br>that you need to be able to use data to<br>inform policy change but you also need<br>to protect the lives of the population<br>that you're using of that data so we did<br>went to a conference and there was a GP<br>study in Australia and we had very very<br>accurate data of where people<br>were well we set this uh scheme up that<br>said well people should have good access<br>to data but there needs to be some<br>wraparounds around it and we need to<br>develop that project a little bit<br>more this is actually my prompt to thank<br>you Peter uh Peter Thorne sitting down<br>here about to wrap up this<br>conversation when hither came back to<br>the university with me in 2006 she<br>started working with Peter Thorn and the<br>Audiology team<br>I've had a fantastic working<br>relationship with Peter and with Grant<br>and with<br>Suzanne and one of the projects that we<br>did was really looked at the future of<br>hearing health and to measure what the<br>risk is going to be in the next few<br>years and to develop some workforce<br>planning around that and so this is some<br>work that I've done with Grant and Peter<br>and Suzanne but also thank you Peter for<br>your wisdom over the last many years<br>guidance of the your understanding of<br>the University system why we should do<br>things and why we do do things and how<br>we can discuss that with your wisdom and<br>your C temperment it's been very much<br>appreciated thank you so<br>much I can see another colleague in the<br>room and this is a fantastic project I'm<br>not going to do all of my collaborations<br>but this is another one for spal justice<br>this is where spatial Justice is at the<br>four talking to people with lived<br>experience of uh mental distress and<br>addiction or or addiction while in the<br>criminal justice<br>system Katie and Stella and her team did<br>a fantastic qualitative survey about all<br>of this they presented some amazing pako<br>around that and I played a really really<br>small part and doing some GIS mapping<br>and stuff around it the key thing here I<br>think is talking to the people with the<br>lived experience working as academics as<br>we do we've got the platform to take<br>that further and take it to the<br>government or whoever needs to listen to<br>make some change and I think that is<br>really really an exemplary project for<br>me to be part of I'm immensely<br>privileged uh sorry this is another aut<br>project wrap up but I'm not leaving the<br>institution War it's not my<br>intent um I think Scott's in the<br>audience as well I'm working on the<br>Tonga haori connecting communities<br>project and this is really about going<br>back to 199 1990s when I was doing the<br>work with the cray community resource<br>access but this time we're talking about<br>thinking much more about the community<br>getting people's advice but working with<br>researchers from all over the country<br>working from a broad network of Industry<br>as well as the community to make some<br>change so again it's a fantastic project<br>and I'm I'm just so grateful to be part<br>of<br>it I couldn't have done any of the work<br>that I've been doing without any of the<br>support from many many different funders<br>whether that's a little bit of<br>Conference travel to get me to a<br>conference from a far away or maybe<br>something a bit more thank you very<br>much to my students um I've got many<br>some of you may be listed here twice but<br>um I think you've been fantastic<br>students I'm I'm privileged to be doing<br>some really really interesting projects<br>not just in the school of population<br>Health but in other parts of the<br>I spoke about equity and equality to one<br>of to a group of teachers on a<br>recruitment Drive I did a we while<br>ago and it really resonated with one of<br>the Stu with one of the teachers there<br>and I'm not sure whether Mary's in the<br>room but thanks for sending<br>this instead of talking about bikes this<br>one talks about a different type of shoe<br>and I think in the same way that I<br>challenge my students or I encourage my<br>students to challenge social norms I<br>think this is an opportunity for us when<br>we move when we move when we leave<br>tonight to move away from a rhetoric<br>around equality and thinking about<br>diversity but maybe becoming a little<br>bit more inclusive and thinking about<br>the space in which everybody can<br>belong non-judgmental just looking at<br>people for who they are and making good<br>progress for the institution or whatever<br>whatever we're doing I think it goes<br>back to my social justice roots to get<br>that sense of inclusion and belonging at<br>the Fort not just thinking about<br>equality or<br>Equity thank you everybody it's been<br>amazing this evening I've just loved it<br>I don't know if you have you I haven't<br>heard that bang of somebody falling<br>asleep and everybody's been laughing at<br>the right places so thank you very very<br>much another key lesson for me is that<br>these opportunities around networking<br>they're the future collaboration<br>opportunities as well there's a lot of<br>people here from outside of my school<br>outside of our faculty<br>even I'd really encourage you when we<br>have drinks and nibbles in a little<br>while find somebody you don't know say<br>hi strike up a conversation who knows it<br>could be the next<br>transdisciplinary uh initiative that we<br>submit across the university kakit<br>tenot to m<br>to<br>no Peter Thor to no uh Dan that was just<br>wonderful and uh thank you very much for<br>inviting me to to to just say a few<br>words at the end here I wasn't quite<br>sure why now I understand but I will<br>have to come back to you to find out<br>what those words with actually were and<br>uh especially the understand understand<br>understanding what how it all works and<br>what goes on in the University I think<br>we could all learn something find find<br>out what what we actually talked about<br>over those<br>things um look it's a real privilege to<br>be here just to to to wrap it up I did<br>see when we got to the the slide on<br>alcohol I noticed there was a little dot<br>on the map just in the Grafton campus<br>and uh so we're all sort of keen to<br>possibil to get out there to have a<br>drink and to celebrate with you so I'm<br>not going to take too<br>long um I just wanted to say a few<br>things I think um it's been a wonderful<br>presentation uh and wonderful lecture<br>which is really befitting of somebody<br>who has really reached the this uh level<br>in in their career and um you took us on<br>a journey which was uh some fascinating<br>insights there uh the the concept of<br>going from Blue to Red was rather<br>interesting I was thinking actually that<br>maybe we should package that in some way<br>and uh for the Americans as to how they<br>might be able to reverse that<br>um there's also a lifetime time of um<br>studying depravity I thought that was<br>kind of<br>interesting and and you even map where<br>it is uh and you I was wondering about<br>where it's worst and where it's best but<br>depending on what you how you consider<br>depravity is what is worst and what is<br>best yeah you stalk princes um you even<br>stalk their their dads and their grand<br>Grandma I thought<br>that and SE sances and various other<br>things we learned all about tonight so<br>um learning a lot about you which we<br>didn't really know I<br>think um I think too we heard a lot<br>about excellence and we heard a lot<br>about impact I rather love your Cloud um<br>your your word cloud about impact that's<br>quite a novel idea actually of being<br>able to demonstrate what the impact of<br>our research is but you are able to fill<br>that with true impact which is around<br>policy and practice and changing<br>changing uh attitudes and changing uh<br>some of the the the um you know having a<br>real real uh impact in your research is<br>something which we all strive for and I<br>think you can take a lot of credit for<br>that with all the teams that you work<br>with that you actually do achieve that<br>we try to many of us but uh you<br>demonstrated at least in a nice slide<br>with the world Cloud which is<br>rather um we learned a lot really about<br>fairness and fairness and equity and<br>these are not<br>negotiable points and I don't think you<br>necessarily say that but you say you<br>Shen your demeanor and you Shen the the<br>way that you actually act and you and<br>you<br>behave and I think that's something that<br>I've had a huge amount of respect for<br>and very valued and uh followed where I<br>can and learned from you about how to<br>actually not just to talk about it but<br>to actually show it and to and to<br>practice<br>it um I think too we learned a lot about<br>the diversity uh the diversity of your<br>research A diversity of the groups that<br>you work with the collaborators that you<br>have and you're a very collaborative<br>person you are genuinely collaborative<br>you enjoy the collaboration is not<br>because it's going to give you another<br>publication or another Grant it's just<br>you're actually truly interested in the<br>work and you're interested in how you<br>can apply your approaches to another<br>problem and to another another issue and<br>uh it's a real Joy working with you and<br>um and we really we all enjoy that and<br>just the number of people that you<br>collaborated with uh is is is<br>extraordinary um I think the one thing<br>which I felt through the lecture you<br>didn't talk a lot much about your<br>teaching and I know that this is a lot<br>about research and and how things uh and<br>and what and how that is actually really<br>identified but you are I mean you're<br>teaching and and you're very very you<br>know it's you're an outstanding teacher<br>and you've had awards for that and I<br>think two it's more about how you<br>consider and you um consider your<br>students and you care for your students<br>and you care not to know about the the<br>learning environment and what they're<br>doing but actually about their<br>well-being and that all sort of pastoral<br>care and I think that was exemplified by<br>a lot of the things that you did during<br>the co uh pandemic you know just<br>actually going out of your way uh well<br>outside hours of work to make sure that<br>the students were all right and I have a<br>lot of admiration for that I think we<br>all<br>do<br>um so look I'm not going to to say much<br>more I think I love this slide because I<br>think this really sums up all those<br>things that you were talking about<br>tonight and um and I like the point that<br>you make is not to challenge social<br>norms and to think about being the<br>Agents of change and I think is<br>something which we actually need to<br>constantly have in our minds uh as<br>academics and we we're talking about a<br>lot of these things currently but I<br>think we do need to think very carefully<br>and seriously about how we can challenge<br>society and CH challenge those social<br>norms so thank you for raising that and<br>demonstrating it so well so Dan um<br>I think you that deserve the drink um<br>I'm sure that you know these are they<br>these are wonderful thing wonderful um<br>opportunities as you said because you<br>got this captive audience they're not<br>going to go anywhere and you can say<br>what you like for an hour and uh but I<br>just wanted to make a point here is that<br>you know this is probably the first time<br>I've ever seen this lecture theater fall<br>at an inaugural lecture well no at an<br>inaugural lecture I have seen it fall at<br>other times but um it's a real Testament<br>actually to both the way the people the<br>respect that people have for you as a<br>person and for your work uh the love<br>that they have for you and I think that<br>everybody's come out tonight to to<br>Really share this wonderful um<br>achievement with you and with Heather as<br>well um and uh we just congratulate you<br>on this um elevation to Professor so<br>Dan we'd want to just give you a little<br>momento of tonight something to take<br>with you um that you can remember we<br>just have to smile for Chris<br>um so congratulations on an outstanding<br>lecture um belonging incl inclusion<br>that's where it's at and um when we're<br>out there tonight let's practice<br>belonging and inclusion the way you've<br>um challenged us to do thank you for<br>your lecture folks please enjoy your<br>time out the back and um congratulations</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
