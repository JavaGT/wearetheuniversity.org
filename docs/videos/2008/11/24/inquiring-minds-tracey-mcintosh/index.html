Today, she is a leading researcher into the sociology of death, criminology and incarceration. Although she admits her areas of study "tend to the dark side" Tracey believes the interrogation of death provides the chance to examine and celebrate life.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hello and welcome to inquiring minds a<br>conversation series featuring some of<br>the renowned academics at the University<br>of ockland I'm krie woodam and joining<br>me now is Dr Tracy McIntosh from the<br>Department of sociology and the faculty<br>of Arts the car now you had a<br>fascinating journey into Academia didn't<br>you because you didn't go to university<br>immediately after school no so you know<br>I I grew up in South Oakland um I came<br>out of school at the time when it was<br>full employment University was not<br>really something that was even<br>particularly talked about you know at my<br>school or any of those sorts of things I<br>went out I got a job and sort of within<br>a a year a year and a half of leaving<br>school I found myself first in France<br>which I stayed for a number of years and<br>then in in central Africa where I also<br>stayed a number of years uh and then<br>back through the Pacific and finally<br>found myself at the University really in<br>my late well I was 30 I think when I<br>enrolled at at the University of Oakland<br>that's not the traditional kiwi<br>France central Africa the pacifican home<br>no I guess it wasn't I decided I I was<br>working at the airport when I first left<br>school you know sort of waitressing uh<br>and um watching planes come and take off<br>and had made some sort of plans to go<br>elsewhere talk to people uh who worked<br>for UTA at the time you know the French<br>Airline and they said you should go to<br>France Without Really any more<br>consideration than that any more sort of<br>information about France I didn't speak<br>French I didn't know anyone there I got<br>on the plane in February and arrived in<br>France having never even seen snow<br>before and it was this this this huge<br>snowstorm so I guess it wasn't the the<br>normal beaten path and actually it took<br>me years to get to England what did you<br>do when you got to France um for the<br>first few days I wondered how long you<br>know how long I'd have to stay without<br>losing face and going home when I sort<br>of suddenly realized you know that I<br>didn't speak the language that it was<br>totally different from me and I didn't<br>know anyone uh but I ended up doing what<br>a lot of people do do and that I ended<br>up teaching um English and I mean even<br>that was a huge education for me because<br>like many new zealanders had not learned<br>the language grammatically and so I was<br>you know one sort of lesson ahead of my<br>students and uh and often not even that<br>lesson ahead of my students so really in<br>many ways it taught me about English it<br>talk about the structure of English and<br>at the same time of course I was<br>learning a new language and I was<br>learning French um so so I I ended up<br>staying in France for I think near five<br>years altogether and certainly<br>unexpected after that and have stayed<br>very sort of very strong even research<br>links within France now and then<br>different opportunities came up and I<br>took them and went to to Burundi and<br>spent time both in Burundi and in Rwanda<br>uh as a as a volunteer for just over two<br>years</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
