He talks about the challenges of working within a culture that has deliberately distanced itself from western influences, and the kind of future that lies ahead for the 500 residents of this threatened island.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hello welcome to inquiring minds a<br>conversation series featuring some of<br>the renowned academics at the University<br>of ockland I'm K woodam and joining me<br>now as associate professor Richard World<br>director of the center for Pacific<br>studies and the faculty of Arts nice to<br>have you with us you're an<br>ethnomusicologist what exactly is that<br>Richard the term was coined only 30<br>years ago and then it related to uh the<br>music of other cultures not your own and<br>so people went out to remote parts of<br>the world and recorded and came back<br>with recordings and analyzed them and<br>then compared them with European music<br>very<br>eurocentric but over time it's changed<br>and now ethnomusicology is much more<br>about not music the product but<br>performance of Music a kind of process<br>and so it fits neatly into some<br>anthropology departments in universities<br>and also into music departments so like<br>musical mag pies just got out and taking<br>all that was bright and originally yes<br>yes and and and archives are full of the<br>fruits of that it's not to say that they<br>weren valuable no that's right because a<br>lot of these musical archives would have<br>been lost wouldn't they if they hadn't<br>been collected a lot of the information<br>recorded in the 50s and 60s and '70s is<br>now very much in demand by the<br>grandchildren of the people who<br>originally provided it such as the rapid<br>rate of culture<br>change what can an ethnomusicologist<br>tell us about a community or a society<br>well one of the the exciting things I<br>believe is that musicing make performing<br>music whether by itself is singing or<br>together with instruments and together<br>with dancing doesn't exist in isolation<br>from everything else every society we<br>know has values and it tries to express<br>those values in different ways we have<br>words that can do it but we also have<br>the language of of symbol the language<br>of gesture why do rock stars receive<br>fabulous salaries why are there only two<br>things two Commodities worldwide that<br>people spend more money on the music and<br>that is on food and on on shelter music<br>comes in number three you got to ask<br>yourself why is that so if music is<br>something that we in New Zealand<br>frequently relegate to an optional extra<br>particularly at schools and the answer<br>is that we can say things through<br>musicing that we can't express in other<br>ways to our<br>satisfaction and so ethnomusicology is<br>able to look at how people perform their<br>music and relate that to values in<br>society the way they organize the<br>society how they prioritize things over<br>other things um how they express values<br>towards each other uh towards the<br>institutions that that make up that<br>society and they can express those in</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
