balance.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>as a yes<br>work-life balance and mindfulness<br>different name same aims this talk came<br>about because I read an article in The<br>Huffington Post and it posed that<br>particular question it was is<br>mindfulness the new way to talk about<br>work-life balance and I thought that was<br>an interesting question so I explored<br>the topic further I really do enjoy the<br>whole sort of work-life balance<br>mindfulness being more organized that<br>sort of topic so this is what we're<br>going to cover so what is work-life<br>balance what is mindfulness is your life<br>actually balanced and how we can improve<br>work-life balance before we get started<br>I do have a question for you if you<br>don't have paper we actually have some<br>paper up here and pens and what we'd<br>like you to do is just think about what<br>you do for fun very broad Christian we<br>just like you to brainstorm that from a<br>couple of minutes even or to see how far<br>we get okay so you might want to think<br>about that for during the course of the<br>seminar you're wondering what the point<br>point of this is we're actually not<br>going to tell you into the very end but<br>there is a point I promise so our next<br>question is work-life balance and<br>mindfulness the same so Tim's and over<br>there is going to write your definitions<br>of work-life balance in mindfulness if<br>you just want to shout out what you<br>think work-life balance might be how<br>if the kind of control of anyone else<br>someone else had their hand up yeah okay<br>so boundaries between work and home any<br>other definitions you've got something a<br>lack of stress lack of stress entirely<br>or okay so you feel comfortable with<br>with the balance and yeah but of lack of<br>and what about mindfulness how would you<br>define their being present yeah aware of<br>people your fee share oh I like that<br>must be where your feet are I really<br>like that it struck a chord obviously<br>anything else I think that encapsulates<br>it do we think being that work-life<br>there is an overlap isn't here and we<br>will explore that tonight<br>I covered all my bases so what is<br>work-life balance so what it isn't and I<br>think actually it's already been talked<br>about it's not equal there's not equal<br>balance it's not like you have to get a<br>perfect score of five every single<br>aspect of your life<br>it might even change daily it can vary<br>over time even daily in terms of sort of<br>that balance for you and then there's no<br>perfect one-size-fits-all so what I<br>think is good work-life balance in<br>Tamsin would change for Natalie for<br>example so what is that meaningful daily<br>achievement in enjoyment in each of my<br>four life quadrants work family friends<br>and self and I think some of those<br>definitions we're heading in that<br>direction<br>so I guess the question is do you feel<br>we're going to get you to do another<br>exercise and this is what you will be<br>doing so this is a Wheel of Life<br>so what we actually want you to do so on<br>this one you can see in the middle there<br>is zero then we've got five and then<br>we've got ten and this person has<br>decided that they're sort of roles in<br>the areas of their life a sports player<br>team member colleague manager mother<br>father I don't know how they can be both<br>partner health career work friend and<br>community leader and so we actually want<br>so really what you need to do is to look<br>at roles or areas so roles it might be<br>the issue it might be a part now you<br>might be just your individual you might<br>be a brother or a sister so I think<br>about those roles then think about the<br>broader areas could be career could be<br>education could be family think about<br>the areas but and it can be a<br>combination of both of those but think<br>about what's most important to you<br>think about your own personal values<br>because your combination is actually<br>going to reflect your personal<br>priorities and life and your values then<br>think about the amount of attention that<br>you're actually allocating to each area<br>and and as Peter said the values as a<br>scale of zero to ten zero being lowest<br>ten being highest and looking back again<br>to this tins are on the outside fives in<br>this the mid end zero and them right in<br>the center there and once you've matched<br>the scores for for each of those then<br>so again I'll just flip back so you get<br>it joined up like this once you've done<br>it for your your current present present<br>tense then think think about your ideal<br>levels and what we want you to do is to<br>have two different sets of scores one<br>for where you feel you are currently and<br>what your ideal level is and I won't<br>give you any more instructions because<br>that's enough for now<br>so I'm going to flip back to this so you<br>can get a sense off of this again so<br>that could be your present and then<br>we'll get you to do another one for what<br>your desired your ideal is so then<br>differentially exercise but you can talk<br>to the person next door to you if you<br>wish just to get some ideas so most of<br>you have got to the action stage I think<br>so you're considering what actions you<br>might take to gain balance that<br>Huffington Post article I was talking<br>about actually asked the question whose<br>responsibility it is so if you have a<br>look at those actions are they your<br>responsibility or is it someone else's<br>responsibility so work life balance we<br>usually actually talk about our employer<br>we do a survey of students and ask them<br>what they most want from an employer<br>what would entice them to actually take<br>a job and work-life balance comes up a<br>lot as though it's the employers<br>responsibility yeah or as so what does<br>it fears or is it a house it is true<br>that an organization and the<br>organization's culture can definitely<br>affect work-life balance but we also<br>have to take some responsibility<br>ourselves so aligning your priorities<br>and life and your values with your work<br>also sitting and communicating<br>boundaries which is really really<br>depakote and then with the whole<br>managing stress so before when we were<br>talking about definition stress came up<br>and then the whole pay attention to what<br>you're doing while you're doing it so<br>that those last two in particular might<br>sound similar to mindfulness so that<br>brings us to the definition of<br>mindfulness mindfulness is paying<br>attention to the present moment with<br>openness curiosity and without judgment<br>and I think that that's what we were<br>talking about on there so it's being<br>present aware of all five senses be<br>where your feet are so I think that fits<br>really nicely and with that particular<br>definition there's two parts to<br>mindfulness so it's actually learning to<br>focus attention on one thing and being<br>able to bring the attention back when<br>your mind gets distracted and mind is<br>very very easily distracted and the<br>whole thing with mindfulness is actually<br>being able to bring it back so it's like<br>your brains are muscle and every time<br>you bring that back you're actually<br>getting better at mindfulness in more<br>focus and attention and then also it's<br>the attitude though it's that attitude<br>have been open and being curious being<br>able to pay attention open long judging<br>and curious about what you're focusing<br>on so it's both of those things my<br>listeners is the opposite of mindfulness<br>so I'm sure we've all had that<br>experience right thing to think but<br>you're driving you get home you have no<br>idea how you actually got there or you<br>have no idea of all those lights are<br>green that you drove through and then<br>there's also that one work one eating<br>lunch at your desk there might be a<br>conscious choice as your employer making<br>you or is it your choice and is it your<br>responsibility to do that or not do that<br>so there are examples of stay<br>automatic pilot and we go through life a<br>lot on automatic pilot we were going<br>through the motions in our mind and<br>we're disconnected from our body I went<br>to the gym before and I was actually<br>thinking about tonight's presentation<br>and so when we were supposed to skip<br>machines I was still thinking about<br>tonight and I keep going on that one in<br>particular machine I was an automatic<br>pilot which is actually really good when<br>you're in the gym so who is responsible<br>for the mindfulness so with work/life<br>balance we think it's both of us some<br>would argue in a net huffington post<br>article he certainly did that it's<br>personal responsibility but it starts<br>with personal responsibility and then<br>radiates out to your colleagues in your<br>family your relationships but if we go<br>back to those choices so those first two<br>in particular you really need<br>self-awareness and those last two I<br>think it's sort of definitely<br>if it is an individual responsibility<br>how come all these organizations are now<br>mindful organizations and these are just<br>a small sample mindfulness is definitely<br>infiltrating work counties Medicare<br>health Auckland District Health Board<br>ey zero Callaghan innovation and then<br>we've got places like Apple Google UK<br>government be becoming more mindful as<br>well so there must be some benefits in<br>it once again<br>work/life balance in mindfulness it<br>looks like it's the responsibility of us<br>but also the organisation and its<br>culture<br>I'll I think I will answer that question<br>but if I don't yeah you may have heard<br>this word mindfulness it's become<br>something of a buzz phrase of later I'm<br>gonna give you one simple serviceable<br>definition which is this mindfulness is<br>the ability to know what's happening in<br>your head at any given moment without<br>getting carried away by it imagine how<br>useful this could be just as an example<br>driving down the road and somebody cuts<br>you off in traffic how do you normally<br>react I think most of us we normally<br>react by having a thought which is I'm<br>pissed and then what happens next<br>you immediately habitually reflexively<br>inhabit that thought you actually become<br>pissed<br>there's no buffer between the stimulus<br>and your reaction with just a little bit<br>of mindfulness in that same situation<br>you might notice my chest is buzzing my<br>ears are turning red I'm having a<br>starburst of self righteous thoughts I'm<br>getting angry but you don't necessarily<br>have to act on it and chase that person<br>down the road screaming at them with<br>your kids in the back of the car<br>thinking you've done nuts now you might<br>be thinking don't I need to get angry<br>sometimes aren't I justified I would say<br>yes but probably not as much as you<br>think the proposition here is not that<br>you should be rendered by mindfulness<br>into some lifeless non-judgmental blob<br>the proposition is that you should learn<br>how to respond wisely to things that<br>happen to you rather than just reacting<br>blindly and that my friends is a<br>superpower how do you get it the way to<br>get it is through meditation<br>I believe that meditation and<br>mindfulness are the next big public<br>health revolution in the 1940s if you<br>told somebody you were going running<br>they would have said who's chasing you<br>but then what happened next the<br>scientist swooped in<br>it showed that physical exercise is<br>really good for you and now all of us do<br>it and if we don't we feel guilty about<br>it and that's where I think we're headed<br>with mindfulness and meditation<br>it's gonna join the pantheon if no<br>brainers like brushing your teeth eating<br>well and taking the meds your doctor<br>prescribed for you let me just close by<br>saying mindfulness is not gonna solve<br>all of your problems it's not gonna<br>render your life a non-stop parade of<br>unicorns and rainbows nonetheless this<br>is a superpower and one that is<br>accessible by you immediately so I've<br>got a link at the end but those that<br>video and another one I'm going to show<br>you later are all on the university<br>health and wellness page - the benefits<br>of mindfulness so it's a tool it can<br>help you reduce worries anxiety stress<br>give you more energy sense of calm sort<br>of sounds too good to be true really<br>doesn't it help you learn to relax<br>regulate your emotions creativity<br>enhance awareness improve concentration<br>productivity develop a sense of empathy<br>and connectedness and enjoy better<br>health and sleep so they actually have<br>done brain scans and have found physical<br>changes in people's brains when they<br>practice mindfulness on a regular basis<br>terms of sort of like what a mindful<br>organization might look like it depends<br>on the organization some of this would<br>embrace this wholeheartedly in a little<br>while I'll get on to a sort of<br>meditation and whether that's<br>mindfulness so some regular meditation<br>others it's an optional program so it<br>looks different in different places but<br>they certainly embracing some of the<br>organization's are really embracing this<br>just the same as the embracing other<br>sort of elements of health and safety in<br>Auckland District Health Board I've<br>personally experienced the fact that<br>they're giving out mindfulness as a<br>prescription I have a bit of an issue<br>with blood pressure when I go in for I<br>get white coat syndrome essentially and<br>I was going in for surgery earlier this<br>year and they I said how can i how can I<br>avoid just about being turned down for<br>surgery like happened to me<br>you see they gave me a mindfulness<br>meditation I was still stressed when I<br>went to the surgery but my blood<br>pressure was not crazy high it was just<br>a little high and so I said to the<br>anesthetist and she said you thank<br>goodness because we had all the notes<br>about like you were going to be like and<br>they now they they suggest so many<br>people do that and they are seeing the<br>benefits across the across the operating<br>theatres and invisibly so so yeah I<br>thought it was a hallo d'etat shrink<br>frankly before I did this but now I<br>actually do but I'm a believer and that<br>leads me beautifully and the science of<br>it I'm glad you laughed at the last<br>video if this one I can't say it's a<br>funny video but I think it's very<br>motivational<br>my name's associate professor Craig<br>hazard and I work at Monash University<br>based originally in the department of<br>general practice mindfulness is very<br>simple it has to do with paying<br>attention<br>it's a present moment to our life as it<br>unfolds but also they cultivating an<br>attitude with which we pay attention<br>researchers and psychologists start to<br>adapt mindfulness that help people with<br>chronic and relapsing depression and<br>when those thirty started to come out<br>showing major reductions in relapse<br>rates some other people start to take it<br>seriously and and literally on the back<br>of the research it's um it's just gone<br>up exponentially since the early 2000s<br>to the point that say last year alone in<br>2016 there were just under 700 new<br>papers published in refereed medical<br>psychological journals one of the<br>interesting things and the challenging<br>thing for people to understand is how<br>mindfulness can have profound effects on<br>our physical health now to understand<br>that we<br>understand a little bit about the<br>fight-or-flight response so for a short<br>period of time we're faster stronger and<br>we'll have more endurance than we<br>normally have now the unfortunate thing<br>is that when we're not mindful we often<br>activate that response when we don't<br>really need it so one of the people to<br>really put this on the map the the<br>chronic effect of this over activation<br>the response was McEwen and he described<br>what he called allostatic load<br>physiological wear and tear like<br>flogging the cart day-in day-out and<br>that's associated with the poor immune<br>function we get less defense against<br>coughs colds infections people like that<br>you get sick during periods of high<br>stress or we get more inflammation the<br>technical terms of immune dysregulation<br>it metabolic affects blood pressure<br>blood glucose blood lipids are out of<br>whack with ins our bones it increases<br>the agreat of that's roast the roast is<br>to hardening of the arteries that leads<br>the heart attacks and strokes and so on<br>if we want to accelerate age and this is<br>how to do it it damages the brain as<br>well so this dress chemicals they entail<br>damaged areas that are very important<br>like the hippocampus so that's a<br>learning and memory center of the brain<br>and the prefrontal cortex so that's<br>working memory and executive function<br>these are our higher functions and<br>damaging those areas the brain is not<br>what we want to do the effects of this<br>high activation of the stress response<br>and so on psychological emotional stress<br>is even been found to go right down to<br>the DNA of ourselves<br>oh so Elizabeth pack Berman an<br>Australian woman who won the Nobel Prize<br>for medicine in 2009 for discovering<br>telomeres she and her team eliezer Apple<br>particularly prominent among the team<br>have found that some over activating<br>this response accelerates the aging<br>process is measured by DNA in terms of<br>telomere length so we can be about a<br>decade older by middle age you've got<br>high levels of anger and hostility and<br>stress and so on compared to somebody<br>who might have the same situation in<br>life<br>but is getting less stressed and<br>reactive over them the interesting thing<br>is when we practice being more mindful<br>and it switches off these the distracted<br>default circuits it engages the sensory<br>errors and the attention centers the<br>brain<br>and when we're sitting down practicing<br>mindfulness meditation those centers in<br>their brain and getting a workout and<br>it's like they're going to the gym<br>alright you're lifting some weights<br>they're on the treadmill it starts to<br>have a whole range of positive effects<br>on the health so we get immune<br>regulation so better immunity we're less<br>likely to get sick with coughs colds and<br>infections<br>switches off excessive inflammation take<br>stress off the cardiovascular system<br>switches down cortisol all the damage<br>there has on the bones Elizabeth<br>Blackburn entertainment in doing work on<br>that in a whole series of studies that<br>started first one published in 2009 that<br>showed that mindfulness switched on the<br>repairing zone and I called telomerase<br>and has been found to slow down the rate<br>of Aging down to the DNA of the cells if<br>that was a drug that would be a<br>so not so happy but definitely<br>motivational I think so<br>they talked in both of those videos<br>about meditation and I used to I went to<br>the Sri from noise center this is years<br>ago to learn how to meditate and I felt<br>like an utter failure because I kept<br>thinking about having what I was going<br>to do afterwards having to pick up<br>dinner etc etc instead of focusing on<br>the Rose that we were supposed to be<br>focusing on so I always thought I<br>couldn't do meditation failure and then<br>I discovered this video and also there's<br>an app called headspace there's also the<br>smiling mind app which I've got links to<br>in the presentation at the end for you<br>and I listened to the app and I watched<br>this video and I thought ah I was<br>actually doing it right all along I just<br>despite what you may have heard<br>meditation does not involve joining a<br>groove paying any fees wearing any<br>special outfits sitting in a funny<br>position or believing in anything in<br>particular it is simple<br>secular scientifically validated<br>exercise for your brain you don't have<br>to do it yet but just so you know here<br>are the three steps 1 sit with your back<br>straight and your eyes closed to notice<br>the feeling of your breath coming in and<br>going out pick a spot where it's most<br>prominent usually that's your nose or<br>your chest or your belly and just focus<br>your full attention on the feeling of<br>your breath coming in and going out now<br>as soon as you try to do this your<br>mind's gonna go nuts you're gonna start<br>thinking about what am I gonna have for<br>lunch what I'm thinking my boss your<br>brain is gonna go nuts and that's fine<br>the whole game is to notice when you've<br>gotten lost and to start over and then<br>to start over again and again and again<br>every time you do that it's like a bicep<br>curl for your brain and it shows up on<br>the brain scan scientists have found<br>this in the lab it's also by the way a<br>radical act you're breaking a lifetime's<br>habit of walking around in a fog of<br>projection and rumination and you're<br>actually focusing on what's happening<br>right now<br>meditation is unlike anything you do in<br>the rest of your life<br>failure is actually success as I said<br>the whole game is just trying failing<br>starting again failing starting again<br>here's my advice you should be<br>meditating every day 5 to 10 minutes a<br>day that's it this doesn't require some<br>giant investment I don't care how busy<br>you are you have 5 to 10 minutes to give<br>this a shot I guarantee you it will make<br>if you find yourself slipping and not<br>able to do that I think all you need to<br>do is look at that science video again<br>every time I watch it that kind of<br>freaks me out a little bit so is<br>mindfulness just meditation so not<br>everyone wants to meditate and so do you<br>have to meditate and is that the only<br>way to be mindful meditation is the<br>formal practice of it but there's also<br>informal mindfulness as well so<br>meditation formal practice women<br>irritate to strengthen our mindfulness<br>skills so that's what that does but<br>there's informal ways of doing that too<br>walking running cooking eating I was<br>having coffee with a friend on Monday<br>and at the cafe<br>besides the coffee you know sometimes<br>they have those little cookies or a<br>chocolate-covered bean or whatever it is<br>and this was was actually apricot and it<br>was really nice so we were talking and<br>then I had her and I was eating it and I<br>was enjoying the flavors and she was<br>chatting to me and she picked up the<br>little apricot thing and she ate it but<br>she was still talking<br>she didn't taste it at all so mindful<br>eating is actually really tasting it<br>enjoying it I'm savoring it and it's<br>just being aware of the textures and<br>everything else and yes I heard a a life<br>coach who is actually a trained<br>psychologist speak and he does executive<br>coaching for extremely high-powered<br>executives and one of the things he does<br>is he goes out to dinner with them but<br>they can't speak neither of them speak<br>they have to just focus on the on the<br>meal and so for 15-20 minutes they just<br>sit there silently eating their meal<br>then at the end of the meal he actually<br>discusses and and the revelations that<br>people get through that of what food<br>tastes like of what what actually they<br>can think about while they're eating<br>he said that some people that's it's a<br>really it's a bit a radical act just<br>eating because they're actually putting<br>their full body and mind into it and<br>there's also such thing as walking<br>meditation as well or walking<br>mindfulness which is pretty much what it<br>sounds like instead of just walking<br>along and listening to your music it's<br>actually when you're walking it's<br>feeling the ground beneath your feet<br>it's playing the tension to the wind on<br>your face or the sunshine and actually<br>noticing your surroundings tamsin and I<br>did it in Albert Park and the things<br>that we saw in that park that would<br>neither notice before no not like that<br>but it wasn't better there but well yeah<br>yeah okay but things like birds in yeah<br>the blossoms and even just the trunks<br>the tree and the back on the trees and<br>the patterns at formed was stuff that<br>would never notice and the stuff we<br>heard too because we heard stuff outside<br>the park so the traffic they were there<br>was bills I think there was a clock<br>tower going stuff that usually you just<br>did you just tuned out but actually that<br>we were really heard all sorts of stuff<br>that just sort of it was mind-blowing<br>experience wasn't it yeah so it doesn't<br>have to be their formal meditation it<br>could be there and I actually know a<br>student who instead of sort of like<br>doing 5-10 minutes a day he actually<br>when he's studying and if he's doing an<br>assignment and he starts feeling a bit<br>stressed he'll just start and just focus<br>on his breathing for a few minutes and<br>then he'll get started again so there's<br>lots of different ways of doing that the<br>playing the music one another thing that<br>you can do and this is a really good<br>stress one is sing silently to yourself<br>but visualize the words as well as what<br>you're singing and visualize the<br>spelling of the words and the shape of<br>the words and all of a sudden you're<br>concentrating so much on the the<br>visualization that you actually the<br>stresses starts to go away because you<br>really read<br>you getting into the nitty-gritty of the<br>shape of the words and those sorts of<br>things so there's all sorts of different<br>little tools that you can use to reduce<br>your stress and we be a much more<br>mindful person so that list that we had<br>you have a look at at the beginning if<br>you have a look at that list now and<br>just think about whether some of those<br>can be mindful activities and then the<br>other thing Timson is giving you a<br>handout and you might be able to find<br>some of those activities on that hand up<br>and that handout will actually tell you<br>what type of addict you are so just as<br>an example I was talking about clearing<br>out clutter so that means I'm getting<br>the serotonin him hit when I do that or<br>I was talking about my to-do list that<br>means I'm getting ahead of dopamine does<br>anyone want to share what they're<br>addicted to you might find that these<br>sort of are in terms of that list maybe<br>you're it's more of the serotonin<br>activities or the dopamine activities<br>you will see some crossover so exercise<br>features and a number of different areas<br>yes I start to like take three of the<br>boxes just by something like going to<br>the gym if you're wondering about coffee<br>and what you're sort of doing with those<br>sorts of activities is it's activating<br>the pair of some sympathetic nervous<br>system so it's empathy and empathy<br>increases your tolerance increases wider<br>perception improve your immunity it<br>sounds very much like mindfulness really<br>it helps yourselves repair and<br>rejuvenate relaxes your muscles slows<br>your heart rate slower and Carman lungs<br>improves your digestion and even<br>decreases blood pressure so all of those<br>sort of activities and the different<br>chemicals that they release within<br>moderation and some of those could<br>become addictions anyone want to share<br>their list yeah the hugs in the shear in<br>a meal and the people-oriented things<br>I'm a mix between the serotonin and the<br>dopamine but there's elements of the<br>others on there as well anyone else and<br>a lot of these when you look at it<br>whether it's the exercise whether it's<br>hugging whether it's sharing a meal all<br>of those things can be done mindfully so<br>then that would increase the pleasure<br>and increase the hit of chemicals that<br>there's like one that's better and we're<br>all a mix and as I said there's some<br>crossover so like exercise comes in<br>there and a number of different ways but<br>we are getting chemicals and ways we<br>didn't realize so if you go to a cafe<br>and you're surrounded by people you get<br>a chemical release so that's why people<br>go to work in cafes and they find their<br>productivity increases even if it's a<br>total they don't talk to anyone they're<br>on their own we're actually getting<br>chemicals<br>we're just addicts basically we just<br>don't realize in social media don't get<br>me started on social media mainly<br>dopamine yes yeah so if you get a like<br>so you go and click I take your Facebook<br>in you someone likes or makes a comment<br>and it also some of them manipulate you<br>like LinkedIn to actually complete the<br>profile because we love to complete<br>it's been in the present moment in its<br>not thinking about what you're doing the<br>next day it's being present with your<br>friends enjoying it not worrying about<br>whether the souffle is going to collapse<br>or not but actually but actually you<br>know sort of like being present with<br>your friends and designing it in a way<br>that you don't have to worry about those<br>sorts of things so it's being where your<br>future yeah I love it and it's also not<br>having your phone on it's not that so<br>it's those sorts of things as well it's<br>being actually in the moment so we were<br>at a restaurant the other night<br>and besides wonderful food they also<br>have a really nice cocktails and we<br>enjoyed ours and then we saw one being<br>served that was in a tube and it was<br>blue and it just looked fantastic it was<br>about this tall and the person that it<br>was put in front off was on her phone we<br>were looking at it in Marvel and she was<br>on her phone and even when she did look<br>up I neither saw his smile or notice<br>that at a wall and he's winix and cheap<br>cocktails over and I just yeah I<br>couldn't get over there she definitely<br>okay so we started with a work balance<br>and mindfulness the same and the answer<br>hopefully it will show we combined the<br>two kind of cheated so we do so these<br>resources the PowerPoint will be sent<br>out to you so we do have some resources<br>for you so the University Health and<br>counseling that's we have those happy<br>videos were but not so happy video is on<br>smiling mind website and there's<br>actually an act that you can download<br>which is free I think it was originally<br>designed for students but now it's for<br>all different age groups they've got<br>different sort of a range of ages the<br>headspace is there's a 10th day free<br>course but then you've got to pay for it<br>Ministry of business innovation<br>employment is a little bit about<br>work-life balance and the benefits for<br>employers and employees and then the<br>article that kind of made us all think<br>about this workshop is the Huffington<br>Post one down the bottom because I do<br>enjoy my books the first one there is<br>actually called unsubscribe and it's<br>about email anxiety and it gives you<br>tips for email anxiety which I don't<br>think you can be have work-life balance<br>if you have your emails going to your<br>telephone for example and if you're<br>continually checking them on the weekend<br>it's about unsubscribing and it's about<br>training the people that receive emails<br>from you about what to expect so if you<br>keep answering them straight away<br>they'll expect you to respond straight<br>away but if you kind of train them<br>that'll take half a day or a day set up<br>those expectations but it's um it's<br>available as an e-book as well as paper<br>as well and I think that's really<br>interesting and I'm not sure if it was<br>the out of date book but I<br>because Everage about fifty four times a<br>day people will check their emails just<br>think of what you could do with<br>achieving a bit more work-life balance<br>if you weren't checking your emails<br>quite so many times each day there is<br>actually an F lots of apps around that<br>you can download onto your phone to<br>actually figure out how many times you<br>actually look at your phone which for<br>some people could be really frightening<br>the heaviness project through him<br>because I just really loved the book she<br>basically takes a different aspect of<br>her life every month and drives and<br>improves it so one of them is<br>decluttering for example so for a month<br>she just focuses on me at one thing<br>which is mindful or another month she<br>focuses on a new hobby another month<br>it's a book book group it's just it's a<br>really nice book it's easy to read but I<br>love the way she just does one thing per<br>month it doesn't try to overextend<br>yourself and then the other two are<br>highly recommended the life matters<br>creating a dynamic balance of work<br>family time and money and then deep work<br>is about focusing it's all about focus<br>and concentration and deep work so once<br>again be mindful not multitasking<br>focusing on the one thing and then as<br>do you have any questions not really<br>it's whenever you can squeeze it in but<br>often things like that are easier to do<br>in the morning so you've got more<br>willpower for a start and your mind is<br>clearer if you think of willpower as a<br>bucket when you've had a good night's<br>sleep the bucket of willpower is full by<br>the time you get tonight their bucket<br>might be empty so that's why you can<br>stick to your diet during the day or go<br>to the gym earlier in the day and at<br>nighttime you stand in front of the<br>fridge open that and you et every link<br>inside your bucket is empty until you've<br>had another night sleep so probably<br>morning<br>so who was that Robert Robert right why<br>Buddhism is true<br>thank you I've just noted that down we<br>can add that to the resources<br>anything else okay thank you very much<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
