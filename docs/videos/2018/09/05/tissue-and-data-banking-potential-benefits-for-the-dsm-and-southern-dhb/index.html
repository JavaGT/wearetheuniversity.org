Perhaps even more so, patient data and patient tissue-derived data, has dramatically increased over the same timeframe.<br><br>Professor Eccles believes a Human Disability and Ethics Committee (HDEC)-registered tissue bank with an associated data bank in the DSM and SDHB would be helpful to manage patient tissue and data for unspecified future research. Pertinent to this idea is the anticipation that tissue- and data-led translational research will soon be able to directly inform clinical decision-making. <br><br>Professor Eccles is involved in two national research programmes, the Maurice Wilkins Centre, and National Science Challenge - Healthier Lives, in which cancer tissue and data processing is centrally involved and evolving towards tissue- and data-led translational research. <br><br>In the USA and Australia, for example, tissue and data banking are an important part of the infrastructure of many leading hospital/ medical school environments. In this presentation, Professor Mike Eccles will discuss these ideas while relating them to the research programmes he's involved with, and discuss new technologies on the horizon for cancer patient management.<br><br>https://www.otago.ac.nz/dsm-pathology/people/profile/index.html?id=728</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and

pathology<br>department and it's my great pleasure to<br>introduce professor Mike equals today<br>Mike is a kit as funded by the cancer<br>research trust is a leading thinker<br>chair so he's a research-only professor<br>and his significant amount of expertise<br>and epigenetics and cancer and he's<br>going to be speaking today about some of<br>this work on it is funded through than<br>healthier lives national science<br>challenge on liquid biopsies but also<br>going to be talking about the concepts<br>of tissue banking and and some of the<br>the ways that we can facilitate that to<br>enhance research in the whole<br>bench-to-bedside translational and<br>research impact around diseases such as<br>cancer thanks bye right hopefully<br>everyone can hear me all right great um<br>thanks Sarah that introduction now I<br>just put you on the spot a little bit<br>there thank you very much so I want to<br>talk today and about the idea of tissue<br>and data banking just just to sort of<br>get a feeling of what sort of interest<br>there is and whether there's you need to<br>the appetite for this sort of thing in<br>the Dineen School of Medicine and the<br>sth be so tissue banks have been<br>obviously around for many years long<br>time decades and registries similarly<br>have been around for a very long time so<br>the question is the fact that these have<br>been around registries can actually<br>exist on their own independent of tissue<br>banks but quite often registries are<br>also associated with tissue banks<br>because they often contain codes that<br>link information and specimens to their<br>so a couple of very good examples of<br>tissue banks in New Zealand include the<br>Auckland regional tissue bank which is<br>part of the a Auckland District Health<br>Board ad HB and also the the Cancer<br>Society tissue bank which is at the<br>Christchurch School of Medicine but<br>clearly these types of tissue banks can<br>facilitate translational research so the<br>translational research activity at the<br>Doreen School of Medicine is is<br>coordinated by Health Research South<br>which is a partnership between the DSM<br>and the Southern District Health Board<br>and looking at what the division of<br>Health Sciences has involved in it<br>clearly is involved in a lot of research<br>including the translation of the<br>research and I'm going to be talking<br>about a couple of these sorts of things<br>today including the genomics our Tarawa<br>and their national science challenges<br>healthier lives so New Zealand has a<br>health research strategy through to 2027<br>and I'm not sure if you've actually had<br>a look at this document in general it<br>can be summarised under areas of common<br>agreement involving the submissions that<br>were made some some a few areas of<br>difference in the submissions and there<br>were some additional themes that were<br>mentioned as well right down the bottom<br>there you can see the idea of building<br>infrastructure and I was reading this<br>document and I was quite surprised that<br>this idea of infrastructure came through<br>time and time again in the submissions<br>which included the idea of building up a<br>national level data and tissue banks so<br>clearly a lot of people are thinking<br>about this in New Zealand but if you<br>look at what global trends are happening<br>in translational health research I came<br>across this review there was in Nature<br>Reviews<br>drug discovery it was a little bit<br>negative and in saying that the<br>development of new medical interventions<br>simply takes too long costs too much and<br>too often ends in failure and also said<br>that the decline and bias by a<br>pharmaceutical productivity ie the<br>innovation gap between fundamental<br>discoveries and and that there's a gap<br>between this and the delivery of new<br>therapeutic products however on the<br>other side of the fence I was at a<br>conference recently the New Zealand<br>Society for oncology and there was a<br>presenter by the name of Rohit Gupta<br>who's from the Stanford bio bank and he<br>was much more positive he's says that<br>every sample has a story to tell<br>then bio banks and and big data will<br>change the world<br>so one of those more famous comments is<br>that samples are not meant to live in<br>the freezer<br>their sole purpose in life is to produce<br>data and I was encouraged as I read<br>further in this nature of views article<br>that they were saying that the field of<br>translational science is poised to<br>provide solutions to those these<br>barriers that I just talked about and in<br>to help bring more medicines to more<br>patients more quickly there's some good<br>examples of this in in Australia and<br>Melbourne and Sydney at various research<br>institutes and also the the UK has<br>started on a very large sequencing<br>project which is called a hundred<br>the 100,000 genomes project was<br>announced by the UK Prime Minister in<br>2012 with the aim to better understand<br>and treat rare diseases and cancers with<br>the project now well underway<br>sue Sabol visited genomics England to<br>see how genomics and personalized<br>medicine will be a key part of NHS<br>deciphering an individual's DNA is<br>entering mainstream medicine in the NHS<br>genomics England is setting up the<br>infrastructure to tailor treatments to<br>patients in the most advanced project of<br>its kind in the world<br>the team running the 100,000 genomes<br>project is making great strides<br>they've already decoded 14 thousand full<br>genetic Maps or genomes we'll know how<br>to choose treatments for cancer<br>individualized to that patient's<br>particular cancer sorry it's a very<br>interesting video goes on for some time<br>but I mean 100 the coming back to New<br>Zealand in the New Zealand research<br>scene what I want to do today is talk<br>about an example of a project that we're<br>doing that aims to incorporate genomic<br>studies and collaborative tissue<br>networking to improve the outcomes for<br>cancer patients so in this work what<br>we're doing is we're taking blood<br>samples from cancer patients and we're<br>taking the plasma from the blood samples<br>and we're isolating nucleic acids and<br>this we should be able to answer several<br>questions that relate to cancer<br>prognosis diagnosis prediction and<br>recurrence and this is part of the<br>healthier lives national science<br>challenge project that we're doing and<br>the work I'm going to talk about in the<br>next few slides was actually done by<br>Sandra Fitzgerald who's in Chris Prince<br>lab at the department of molecular<br>medicine in pathology in Auckland<br>University but there is a this project<br>as a multicenter project and there is a<br>another part of the project been done in<br>Dunedin here and professor Perry<br>Guilford's lab which is on placement<br>genomic biomarkers in bowel cancer and<br>in my lab you and Roger whose pictures<br>here has just started this project in<br>currently the the gold standard is<br>histopath illogical analysis of of<br>melanoma samples or melanoma and<br>biopsies so if the suspicious lesion is<br>seen by a health professional a biopsy<br>usually taken and then that is examined<br>processed and examined by a pathologist<br>who will look to see whether or not a<br>melanoma lesion is present in the tissue<br>sample so what this project that I'm<br>talking about hopes to be able to do is<br>to provide a complementary type of<br>technology which looks at plasma<br>biomarkers and this hopefully should be<br>able to facilitate detection or<br>confirmation of cancer increased<br>flexibility in the monitoring of tumor<br>responses following treatment and<br>potentially for the earlier detection of<br>of tumor recurrence so this just a<br>general principle outline in the general<br>principle to what's involved in plasma<br>as so-called circulating tumor DNA<br>testing one gets a blood sample from a<br>patient typically about 10 mils of blood<br>takes the plasma and isolates the<br>nucleic acids and then following this if<br>so tumors are shedding DNA into the into<br>the blood at a fairly consistent rate<br>and if the tumor contains mutations that<br>one can detect such as for example the<br>shown here the v600e mutation then using<br>various methodologies you can actually<br>detect that in the circulating tumor DNA<br>in the blood so this methodology has<br>been around for a few years and there<br>are actually now already are not quite a<br>number of publications which are rapidly<br>increasing since about 2014 and so it<br>was actually first found back in the<br>1960<br>and seventies that you could detect<br>circulating free DNA in blood plasma was<br>in 2012 that was shown that you that<br>minimal residual disease could be<br>detected and blood plasma DNA in since<br>then that's been looked at in a number<br>of cancer types including breast<br>colorectal lung cross prostate<br>pancreatic cancers and so on however in<br>ESCO this year it was said that more<br>evidence is needed to establish<br>effective and appropriate use of liquid<br>biopsy tests and people with cancer in<br>the clinic so there is a need for more<br>so now on OMA it turns out is probably a<br>perfect fit for doing liquid biopsy type<br>studies because the mutations that occur<br>in the BRF in the inner ears oncogenes<br>very frequent and they occur probably up<br>to about 60% of all cutaneous melanomas<br>some of our colleagues that the Edith<br>Cowan University in Perth have that's<br>Elin gray and Mel Simon have written<br>this this little review and this is a<br>table from that review that indicates<br>that quite a number of studies have been<br>already and so what we're currently<br>looking at with with Sandra Fitzgerald<br>and in my group here at Otago we're<br>looking at how sensitive this technology<br>is so as with all technologies there<br>will be a limit of detection we can get<br>down to around one mutant copy of DNA in<br>about a thousand wild types or even as<br>far down as one mutant copy in about<br>10,000 world hard copies<br>and so this is most achievable using<br>droplet digital PCR which which I'll<br>talk about more in my talk today detects<br>single mutations and in the plasmid DNA<br>there are other technologies which were<br>also trying out one called ultra seek<br>which is a mass spectrometry type of<br>detection method and it's able to detect<br>it's about same sensitivity as droplet<br>digital PCR and it could detect multiple<br>mutations simultaneously in the plasma<br>and then another technology we were<br>trying as next-generation sequencing<br>where one can detect even a couple<br>hundred mutations simultaneously but<br>it's a little less sensitive so there<br>are some variations and how these<br>various methodologies come here<br>so the ultra-secret a bit more volume<br>input in terms of DNA i mentioned that<br>about sensitivities probably the lowest<br>cost is the drop of digital PCR and also<br>it has the lowest time taken for going<br>from sample to result so droplet digital<br>PCR seems like it's quite a good<br>methodology for this type of analysis so<br>what what actually droplet digital PCR<br>involves is the encapsulation of DNA<br>into little droplets of oil and so the<br>less than or equal to one copy of DNA<br>per droplet is encapsulated and along<br>with that is all the people the reagents<br>required for carrying out PCR reactions<br>and so as a result of doing the PCR one<br>can detect either the wild type or the<br>mutant copies so each of these spots or<br>dots here represents one droplet and<br>that's the fluorescence of the droplet<br>as as detected as being either wild type<br>or mutant so to date Sandra and Auckland<br>has actually analyzed 24<br>or patient samples using all three well<br>twenty four of them in it have been<br>analyzed using droplet digital PCR for<br>mutations in these couple of genes<br>twenty-one have been screened with the<br>ultra seek method and seventeen using<br>next-generation sequencing all of these<br>patients have been recruited through the<br>Auckland regional tissue bank which has<br>been fantastic for them to be able to do<br>that and what I'm thinking about now is<br>just as we are getting started and<br>Dunedin we should we'd like to really<br>set up a Dunedin based bio being for<br>this kind of work so I want to talk now<br>just introduce or bring you show you<br>briefly some of the results that have<br>that Sanders been getting with some of<br>these patients so on this slide is<br>showing these this red line here is the<br>lactate dehydrogenase or LD h level and<br>there gray line is as the probably upper<br>limit of the normal level that you might<br>find in circulating in blood so in this<br>patient who is a stage four melanoma<br>patient who's actually on immunotherapy<br>treatment from day you can see from day<br>one to day 148 the levels of the LD h<br>have been going up and you can also see<br>that the levels of the shown here the<br>circulating tumor DNA shown and the blue<br>columns has also been going up which<br>parallels the increasingly old eh live<br>was clearly well this patient also has<br>stage four patient had a mess that's<br>shown here in the in the groin of the<br>patient and you can see between the<br>scanner before day 1 min later scan at<br>about day<br>this mess has actually grown in size so<br>this patient appears to be progressing<br>while on immunotherapy treatment and<br>that's actually shown by all of these<br>three methodologies that I've just<br>talked about the next patient here this<br>is a patient also a stage four melanoma<br>patient who is receiving immunotherapy<br>and and here the LDH is sort of fairly<br>flat so that the circulating tumor DNA<br>showed sort of that wind up initially a<br>day 41 and then and then scum down by<br>that day 80 and then then it went up<br>again since day 80 or since about day<br>100 and it's it's gone way up again so<br>what happened to the to the tumor<br>well this tumor did show at day 100 also<br>a sort of a reduction and size which<br>corresponds with the the circulating<br>tumor DNA result but we haven't that we<br>haven't got a CT scan since then and it<br>appears from a CT DNA work that this<br>tumor this patient may be relapsing but<br>we haven't actually communicated these<br>results back to the clinician at this<br>stage the next patient patient three you<br>can see from the leg LDH that this this<br>tumor seems to be growing and<br>progressing you can see from the CT scan<br>this is nodules that are present you can<br>see many more Nigel's in the lung at at<br>the CT scan at day 64 I think it is and<br>along with that you can see that the<br>circulating tumor DNA levels are<br>actually increasing inexorably over this<br>time frame so this patient is also<br>progressing on treatment with<br>immunotherapy and lastly this patient<br>and the arrays mutation was detected in<br>this patient<br>there's this LDH also appears to be<br>fairly flat and it's under their levels<br>of normal normal they also fell th and<br>the blood you can see these CTD and<br>circulating tumor DNA decreased over<br>that time and sort of went away entirely<br>and on CT scan this is a a tumor mass<br>which is the first gain is under the<br>right armpit here but of tumor mass<br>there and the second scan is also under<br>the armpit and a different plane and<br>although there seems to be some sort of<br>mixed response going on CT scan the CT<br>ships reclaimed tumor DNA might indicate<br>that this patient was having a response<br>so so in just to sort of summarize this<br>and we're doing a lot more pattern I've<br>only talked about a few patients here<br>Sandra's got results on a lot more<br>patients and I hope I'm not presenting<br>here but one of the patients we saw that<br>the circulating tumor DNA rose very<br>significantly several weeks before we<br>could see a rise in the LDH and and also<br>any changes that were happening on the<br>CT scan so this this type of work<br>suggests that that it could be useful<br>for the identification and monitoring of<br>melanoma patients for<br>treatment-resistant or response or<br>relapse it also could be useful for<br>patients who live in smaller centers in<br>New Zealand who could seen their blood<br>samples for testing at regular intervals<br>so it's possible that dropper digital<br>PCR could predict response to treatment<br>to immunotherapy for example and and<br>could be more accurate than LDH it's<br>possible that monitoring the see<br>circulating tumor DNA could complement<br>standard of care treatment but you know<br>as the ESCO things did we need a lot<br>more work and so this is really still<br>under under investigation<br>so we're going to continue collecting<br>monitoring melanoma patients circulating<br>tumor DNA we're going to try and develop<br>more sensitive essays we want to<br>integrate the clinical side and the<br>genomics and the patient registries and<br>patient electronic medical health<br>records together we won't also do a tube<br>trial for those patients who are living<br>in the smaller centers and see whether<br>or not the DNA survives the several days<br>that it takes to get from our centers<br>into a testing center in a more Maine<br>Center and collaborations are important<br>and also we want to we have to move<br>quickly it's this research is spanning<br>between translational research and the<br>clinical realm so we also think that<br>this could actually shift some of the<br>cancer surveillance potentially away<br>from hospitals and closer to primary<br>care situations it might complement the<br>use of CT and PET scans and it could<br>have implications for treatment<br>decisions such as whether to do advant<br>treatment or or to whether to continue<br>on systemic treatment and we hope that<br>it will be specific for New Zealand<br>patients and that it would be available<br>eventually at and at an affordable cost<br>so what we need is we need coordination<br>between the clinicians and the<br>scientists for this and we need to<br>develop our systems of for data and<br>tissues this is going to require<br>collaborations and we also need to do<br>further consultation with Maori and<br>Pacific er experts in order to be able<br>to reduce the inequalities that there<br>are in the population not so much with<br>melanoma but certainly we're going to<br>expand this hopefully to other tumor<br>types like breast cancer and it's<br>already been investigated and bowel<br>cancer and in Perris lab the genomics<br>infrastructure is probably not at the<br>level and it's a bit limited to be able<br>to do<br>sorts of research that we want to do in<br>New Zealand so we need to develop better<br>infrastructure and one of the new<br>approaches that it's just to come around<br>as the genomics era who had just started<br>their their whole operation very<br>recently and it's been led out of the<br>University of Otago by Professor Peter<br>dead and in the biochemistry department<br>and it's hoped that Missy which is the<br>New Zealand East science infrastructure<br>will help help to host some of the<br>systems that genomics our taro will<br>develop so genomics Ferrara will have<br>several exams in fact one of these will<br>be sequencing of a thousand genomes of<br>Maori individuals from around New<br>Zealand they also want to develop<br>bioinformatics capability in New Zealand<br>and also the sorts of things that I've<br>been talking about which is<br>computational interfaces which might be<br>available on DC systems so in relation<br>to this I've been thinking for quite a<br>while and we've started some work on a<br>potential garda infrastructure called<br>cancer hub which is actually not part of<br>GA at this point but you can actually<br>have a look at cancer hub bits<br>it's a dub dub dub can't have dotnet<br>what we are aiming to do is to allow<br>researchers to be able to access New<br>Zealand cancer patient datasets via<br>cancer hub and to be able to use online<br>tools for doing cancer research<br>including hosting New Zealand cancer<br>patient data in a repository and having<br>facilities like C by a portal to be able<br>to carry out genomics analysis we also<br>hope that this portal and this facility<br>will be able to support the involvement<br>of patients in<br>be more becoming involved in cancer<br>research so we want to be able to<br>provide infrastructure for care for<br>patients to be able to know what kind of<br>things they need to do to be able to get<br>involved in research - and included in<br>this is consultation with with Maori to<br>actually you know do things which are<br>appropriate for Maori to help to address<br>the inequities that are in the<br>population and patients may be able to<br>go onto the portal right now even and<br>from an amalgamation of different<br>clinical trial sites that there are<br>we've put these together as a as a<br>facility that patients can look for and<br>find clinical trials on cancer in New<br>Zealand and also we're hoping they'll be<br>able to develop a network so researchers<br>and Dunedin for example could look in in<br>Auckland and try and find a person who<br>has similar interests for example who<br>they may not know at this stage so about<br>ten days ago I had set up this online<br>end of an invitation for people to have<br>the SI and so so far actually we've had<br>some 27 responses and I did my<br>completion at 23 responses at 8:00 p.m.<br>on the 3rd of September but I still come<br>in and right at the moment and so 22<br>people gave the their scores from one to<br>five on several on seven discussion<br>points that I raised and 11 of these<br>also gave some additional free text<br>comments so I thought I would just share<br>these with you and go through some of<br>these discussion points so discussion<br>point one is that local integrated<br>databases aimed at collecting and<br>storing research data which are linkable<br>to other health data if done in the<br>right way will be a message to New<br>Zealand and I was reasonably surprised<br>that a lot of people will actually<br>fairly strongly agreed with<br>a statement with the median an average<br>of five and one one person said that he<br>they felt that integrated data is<br>extremely important for innovative<br>research and the major barriers to the<br>use of data reside at the at the<br>approvals level or you can actually have<br>a look at there were all these points<br>later on and you can come back to this<br>by going online I think to the to the<br>talk so I won't go through all of these<br>individual points but I'm just raising<br>some things that have popped out that I<br>thought were interesting discussion<br>point to is the existing levels of<br>protection are not adequate to protect<br>patient privacy in the context of either<br>genomics or clinical trials health<br>research databases in New Zealand and<br>there was a fairly mixed response<br>neither<br>well.some strongly agreed some strongly<br>disagreed but it was very mixed some<br>people said they were very concerned as<br>to who retains ownership of biobank<br>materials one person said what we need<br>sensible informed discussions around how<br>to best protect people's data use these<br>data in an ethical way engage properly<br>at all levels with Maori and Pacific and<br>ensure these data are used for the<br>public good discussion point three was<br>that enhancing local collaborations and<br>increased use of tissues and data will<br>be important to facilitate more<br>translational health research then as<br>currently happening so the one person<br>commented that a national guard abase<br>would be an excellent step in the right<br>direction so that researchers can at<br>least assess what tissues might be<br>available I think they're talking about<br>like having some kind of framework where<br>you can actually see what what's<br>available across all the different<br>tissue banks in New Zealand which i<br>so discussion point four was there lack<br>of time in other resources at the<br>disposal of healthcare professionals<br>within the DHBs is impeding growth of<br>translational health research capacity<br>locally and there was you know<br>reasonably strong agreement with a<br>statement one person said that maybe the<br>key is to start small and but rather<br>than to build all aspects of the system<br>another person said that collaborative<br>banking and New Zealand makes sense as<br>our institution to small discussion<br>point five was that participation in or<br>collaboration in translational health<br>research eg such as clinical trials<br>research there's not really part of the<br>culture of New Zealanders at the present<br>time one person said what cultural<br>considerations would be needed if<br>biobanking was to be implemented more<br>frequently in New Zealand another person<br>said collaborative banking in New<br>Zealand is absolutely necessary to<br>enable any meaningful research to occur<br>here on low incidence type pathology for<br>example pancreatic malignancies overall<br>that was a fairly mixed response to that<br>statement then discussion point six was<br>that greater development of the concept<br>of dhb based translational research<br>centres will enhance the growth of<br>translational Health Research locally<br>and there was fairly strong agreement<br>with the statement one person said I<br>think this depends upon a collaboration<br>between universities and DHBs and lastly<br>discussion point seven was that DHBs<br>should be funded by the government so<br>they can support infrastructure in<br>resources for translational health<br>research and I was really surprised by<br>the response to this a lot of people<br>were actually strongly agreed with this<br>statement one person<br>may be a better option may be to<br>separate out the funding like the UK<br>does to the National Institutes of<br>Health Research which sits separate to<br>individual NHS trusts so I was you know<br>really encouraged by the responses and<br>an I feel as though we should make an<br>effort and I want to also point out that<br>the University of Otago has a strong<br>foundation for collaborative tissue<br>networking and being able to do<br>associated data data registries in a<br>host of related areas for example we've<br>got excellent tissue banking going on at<br>the Kent Society tissue bank in<br>christchurch we have researchers here<br>who are leaders and ethical and legal<br>aspects of tissue banking and patient<br>registries and the Denning School of<br>Medicine has strongly established and<br>highly integrated links to the Southern<br>District Health Board and to the Dunedin<br>hospital the University of Otago and the<br>Doreen School of Medicine have strong<br>reputations and clinical trials research<br>and and and so the health research<br>itself is also extremely good at the DSM<br>we have strong genomics capabilities as<br>well as we has been the host for<br>genomics our Tarawa as well as there we<br>have strong genetics research and<br>teaching at Otago for example genetics<br>Otago so all of these I think bode well<br>for the idea of actually going forward<br>in you know doing some more in regards<br>to tissue collaborative tissue<br>networking and in collaborative data<br>registries so what I'm thinking about is<br>how to plan this and how to involve this<br>and the research that I'm doing and<br>planning how to do next steps so I think<br>what we need maybe is to form a planning<br>group here in Otago and we need more<br>consultation with Maori and Pacific Oh<br>we need constipations with our academic<br>and clinical colleagues many of whom are<br>collecting tissues already we need to<br>develop the ethical applications for<br>this and we need to think about the<br>infrastructure that's needed for<br>coordinating data in tissue respond<br>repositories and we need to develop and<br>governance in an oversight of this<br>activity we need to think about how we<br>can actually do you know for some say<br>the staffing needs and gain some<br>financial support one thing I want to<br>really emphasize is we're on the cusp of<br>doing some major genomic sequencing with<br>genomics arturo<br>and in particular i think this all needs<br>to be coordinated in coordinated with<br>Dunedin Hospital rebuild so hopefully<br>leave some time for some some discussion<br>at the end<br>but I want to acknowledge my colleagues<br>that are involved in this and at the<br>University of Otago particularly Harry<br>Guildford and Rob day you and Roger in<br>my in my lab Tanya Slater<br>Heather Kamath and Sarah Sarah Gallagher<br>has helped me put this presentation<br>together and Becky Laurie has been very<br>important and putting this together as<br>well a lot of the stuff that I talked<br>about was actually done by Chris prints<br>lab group particularly by Sandra<br>Fitzgerald but here in Dunedin we've got<br>collaborations that are becoming<br>undergoing are coming underway with<br>Chris Jackson DB Skinner will McNichol<br>will Macmillan and petrol Island in<br>Collins and other collaborations are in<br>Auckland as well and also this has<br>involved as I see the Auckland regional<br>tissue bank team hopefully we can<br>develop a team here at Otago for for<br>doing this work so I'd like to thank you<br>all for coming along and listening and<br>your discussion will be welcome thank<br>you<br>so um Mike's happy to take questions now<br>for the next ten minutes or so before we<br>had to move out for a class so any<br>questions I'd like to ask for comments<br>I'd like to make about some of these new<br>initiatives that we want to give up when<br>to use them you need to we need to pass<br>the microphone around because quite a<br>number of people's watch this on<br>livestream and the use the microphone<br>sorry so you can throw it around like a<br>I think so a presentation is really cool<br>to see these ideas taking shape<br>ourselves that the Faculty of Dentistry<br>have been discussing similar things as<br>well doing a tissue bank more dental<br>bays one so be interesting to discuss<br>further this with you guys I'd like to<br>know how do you see this complimenting<br>or even overlapping with the work that's<br>done with the Cancer Society tissue bank<br>and how do you see alternatives for for<br>funding for this project because my<br>understanding is that the Cancer Society<br>tissue bank they use the university<br>facilities in space but the funding is<br>provided pretty much hundred-percent<br>by the Cancer Society so how could we do<br>this happen here hmm that's true so I<br>think that we would set up systems which<br>are very complimentary to the Cancer<br>Society tissue bank and try to work with<br>them as partners and they have a<br>separate board so I don't think we would<br>actually be under the governance or<br>anything like that but I think we would<br>try to actually have systems which can<br>interact with with the systems that they<br>have so they received as you say some<br>funding from the the Cancer Society and<br>Cantabrigian the west coast well maybe<br>we could actually approach these<br>Southland and Otago Cancer Society here<br>to see if they're interested in<br>providing some support along these lines<br>maybe the Freemasons might be an idea I<br>think the Freemasons actually has had<br>provided support for the Auckland<br>regional tissue bank it at the start I<br>think obviously the kids can study in<br>Christchurch gets a little bit of its<br>revenue through charging for use of the<br>sample so there is that possibility you<br>go to charge although that's not going<br>to cover the majority of the costs I<br>don't think but I think the more we<br>think about it there the more<br>possibilities and things will come up<br>with it they could facilitate funding<br>opportunities for this thanks for a<br>really good talk so I was also thinking<br>about funding and nationalized databases<br>and that sort of thing but if you were<br>going to start with in a local area like<br>Dunedin one way of generating some<br>funding if we just wanted to leave it to<br>departments to actually do the banking<br>of the tissue and the way they wanted<br>and but have centralized IT benefit of<br>having centralized IT is that that<br>reduces some costs and also enables us<br>to hear nationalized IT if we follow<br>whatever Christchurch is using it also<br>helps to ease that ethics process which<br>I'm sure you've considered and perhaps<br>also easier process of universal consent<br>to help ensure that tissue that's bent<br>and doesn't all get used can then be<br>used for other purposes but a way of<br>achieving planning for that might be to<br>create a bit of departmental somo and<br>the end of the I mean these are a lot of<br>departments probably represented in this<br>room that together would be able to<br>generate a reasonable source of funding<br>just that idea if that was all we were<br>trying to achieve you agree so another<br>possibility is if we could make it a<br>research infrastructure that could be<br>boredom through the kind of the drink<br>mechanisms and the division of Health<br>Sciences perhaps but I agree with your<br>points and I think that to some extent<br>you know if we were able to tap into<br>individual research grants with just a<br>little contribution from each then that<br>could actually go quite a long way from<br>I might thanks very much for your<br>presentation and just quickly on some of<br>the things that we haven't talked on is<br>the quality of the specimens I know that<br>Carolyn Compton the director of the<br>biospecimen effort at the National<br>Cancer Institute for that the Cancer<br>Genome Atlas Project learns that you<br>know for those samples that they need to<br>acquire from multiple laboratories and<br>science can fall over if the<br>preservation isn't by a national<br>standard I know there's a lot of<br>guidelines such as there's Bri<br>guidelines that are now in place and I<br>think that that's something that we if<br>we're going to kick off an effort like<br>this perhaps we should suggest some<br>national policy guidelines to to flesh<br>out that everyone should follow yeah<br>thanks for that giver I think that's a<br>very good point and I think that<br>Christchurch has been setting up some<br>pretty good systems for getting good<br>quality samples and be interesting to<br>actually sort of compare and contrast<br>with what Auckland has been setting up<br>and pick the best of both worlds I guess<br>and set up you know and and I actually I<br>think have standardized protocols that<br>we know what kind of samples were<br>getting for what kind of purposes in the<br>end and everything is as best quality as<br>about the question of focus how do you<br>miss setting us up obviously we've each<br>got an interest and we could itemize<br>those is that where we should be<br>starting they say that Hocus focus yeah<br>because we can't collect everything<br>specially you know the confirmation is<br>really quite time-consuming yeah<br>either I think that we should be pretty<br>focused initially on projects that are<br>at hand and what's actually required to<br>make those projects work so in the case<br>of the one that I was just talking about<br>I guess we could focus on the<br>requirements for the blood samples and<br>and trying gets infrastructure that<br>makes that work if other people are<br>bringing other projects we perhaps we<br>need to make a decision as to what<br>projects we are willing to bring in at<br>this stage just so that it's not<br>overwhelming but actually try and set up<br>the requirements for each project so<br>that we can make each project work and<br>thank you for the tour we're interesting<br>do you think we have adequate<br>computational support at at Agra for<br>this kind of initiative or is this<br>something that will need to be developed<br>and when I say computational support I<br>mean not just the hardware and things<br>but also methods and software and I<br>think we have very good capabilities<br>I've got good tumour bioinformaticians<br>that I'm working with and I think that<br>computationally we can I think we can<br>see it up systems which can manage to do<br>these sorts of things that I'm talking<br>about like bringing and see by a portal<br>making the appropriate repositories at<br>the moment on I am and discussions with<br>neesey and we're working because they're<br>actually just you know re-freshing their<br>systems and coming up with with new<br>infrastructure and so I'm actually<br>working with them to see if they can<br>actually provide some support as well<br>that we can do something that actually<br>is useful for more people than just just<br>comments or questions come and talk to<br>Mike at the end and as Mike has alluded<br>to he's gonna be setting up a group to<br>discuss the idea about biobanking and<br>how we could move forward so if any of<br>you have any particular interest in that<br>please contact Mike and make sure that<br>you're known to him so we can make sure<br>that we capture your thoughts about it<br>and also a couple of additional points<br>so as mentioned I mean dreg so the<br>divisional research infrastructure<br>governments group could be an<br>opportunity and we have discussed this<br>in the past around funding sitting up<br>some seed funding for a biobank and also<br>with the new hospital that's being built<br>certainly biobanking as part of the<br>schedule activities that have been<br>captured by the planning team to go into<br>an a research area that's associated<br>with clinical research and the new<br>hospital so and we've got some great<br>opportunities coming they're coming<br>up in this space so thank you very much<br>for coming along and just join with me</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
