autumn awry<br>terracotta terracotta terracotta Cartaya<br>contribution in the series of the 50<br>50th anniversary lecture series of the<br>Faculty of medical and Health Sciences<br>thank you for coming out on an evening<br>like tonight I'm Erin Murray and I'm<br>head of the School of Medicine here and<br>I will be master of ceremonies tonight<br>but before we start the main part I'd<br>like to introduce sue brewster to speak<br>about a MRF good evening everybody and<br>I'll just echo Ellen's words thank you<br>so much for coming out this evening<br>it's cold and it's rainy so you are the<br>brave frontier that has come out tonight<br>and you will not be disappointed we've<br>got a fantastic range of presenters<br>talking tonight about a whole host of<br>subjects so I am from Auckland Medical<br>Research Foundation and we've been very<br>fortunate to partner with the Faculty of<br>medical and Health Sciences for this<br>lecture series it's the 50th year<br>celebration so I'd actually just like to<br>acknowledge Distinguished Professor Ian<br>Reed and also professor John Fraser and<br>thank them very much for our partnership<br>in the opportunity to be involved it's<br>been absolutely invaluable in the 6<br>lecture series we've had have all been<br>different but immensely worthwhile in<br>terms of knowledge and information<br>that's been imparted so thank you and<br>I'd all just like to say there<br>tonight's lecture series includes a<br>whole range of subjects one of them<br>being diabetes and if I reflect on where<br>research has taken diabetes over the<br>years it's been hugely significant in<br>terms of understanding both type 1 and<br>type 2 but I think I also saw something<br>recently which showed how insulin used<br>to be injected so the things that we<br>used to take we take for granted as the<br>way that even we administer medication<br>these days and pharmacology is one of<br>the subjects tonight has changed so<br>immensely and that is due to research so<br>for all of our supporters here tonight<br>and everybody who makes that research<br>possible thank you so much<br>because it does change lives and it<br>brings massive advancements and medicine<br>and last word on Oakland Medical<br>Research Foundation for those of you<br>that don't know we fund medical research<br>and that's our sole purpose and due to a<br>generous benefactor giving us all of our<br>administration expenses a hundred<br>percent of your donation can actually go<br>into medical research so that's<br>something that people really value for<br>our organization so thank you very much<br>for coming tonight thanks for the<br>opportunity to say hello and I'm sure<br>you will enjoy all of the wonderful<br>presenters here tonight thank you thank<br>you very much and I would just<br>reciprocate with the thanks of the<br>faculty for the support of the Amr if<br>and my own personal thanks because I<br>have been a recipient of some of the<br>grant money from time to time now the<br>format for this evening is that we have<br>four very distinguished speakers who<br>will each present quite different talks<br>actually but I think it will work best<br>if we take the four talks and then<br>they'll come up as a panel and we'll<br>have a chance to have questions on any<br>of them at the end so if you have<br>burning questions during any of the<br>presentations just make a note of them<br>and we'll deal with them at the end so<br>the first of our speakers<br>tonight his professor Sally Mary<br>professor Marie is a child and<br>adolescent psychiatrist the cure kids<br>Duke family chair in child and<br>adolescent mental health and the head of<br>the department of psychological medicine<br>in the faculty professor mary is<br>interested in the development and<br>implementation of effective therapies in<br>child and adolescent mental health<br>including computerized mobile<br>phone-based<br>interventions and she's going to talk to<br>us on but spots and beyond the promise<br>of challenge and technology in improving<br>mental health Sally<br>Thank You Ellen and greetings to<br>everybody tena koutou katoa<br>talofa lava Malloy Daly Wampus if occur<br>greetings will Mary greetings and warm<br>greetings to all our varied population<br>in New Zealand it's a great pleasure and<br>honor to be here tonight and I'm going<br>to talk to you about bits and BOTS and<br>the promising type and challenges of<br>using technology and I guess one of the<br>questions that's that people say to me<br>is you're a child psychiatrist you<br>shouldn't be using technology we're<br>supposed to be getting our kids off<br>phones we're supposed to be getting them<br>off computers we're especially getting<br>them to exercise more to interact more<br>aren't you worried about the<br>difficulties about that for me<br>technology is a two-edged sword and I<br>think the first question is why use<br>technology anyway and I've been an<br>advocate for this for many a long year<br>and for me the reason is that 13 to 20<br>percent of young people have a mental<br>disorder in one year and less than half<br>of us gets treated imagine if less than<br>half of our young people with asthma or<br>with diabetes was treated imagine the<br>outcry<br>and yet we leave our young people with<br>mental health<br>without the help they need we've got you<br>us figures on the lack of treatment but<br>this is also borne out in New Zealand<br>and in New Zealand the secondary mental<br>health services are funded only for the<br>three percent of young people with the<br>most severe mental health problems on<br>the other hand New Zealanders at early<br>adopters and by the middle of last year<br>there were 3.8 million mobile phones<br>with active internet connections and we<br>know that young people are on phones we<br>know because it's driving us crazy<br>because we keep telling them to switch<br>their phones off we also know that it's<br>spread around the country and that it's<br>actually spread very widely so including<br>for Maori and Pacific people some of the<br>people who have the biggest disparities<br>in mental health so my story with this<br>and I'd like to share a little bit about<br>this goichi goes back to through 2003 I<br>had a conversation with a GP friend of<br>mine many years ago who was picking up<br>mental health problems in her general<br>practice and couldn't find therapists to<br>see the young people she was seeing and<br>she said to me I think you should take<br>cognitive behavioural therapy one of the<br>evidence-based therapies particularly<br>for depression and anxiety and put it<br>onto a cd-rom so that I can run it in my<br>office and I had a PhD student who's now<br>doctor Karolina Stasi AG who's very able<br>and quite charismatic researcher and she<br>set out to make a very early prototype<br>using flesh based program to put CBT<br>onto a cd-rom and she also created a<br>education program and she did a<br>randomized control pilot trial to<br>compare the two and showed that the<br>journey worked all well and good except<br>that she got feedback from the young<br>people who said well this is ok but<br>actually it's quite boring compared with<br>the games that we play and they had a<br>whole list of things that they thought<br>thought that they wanted us to do to<br>improve it<br>they were very fortunate to be able to<br>then have this to take to the Ministry<br>of Health who then funded the<br>development of a serious game and we set<br>out to create sparks and what we wanted<br>to do here was to address some of the<br>differ<br>Cortese that they had identified so we<br>wanted to make it immersive we wanted to<br>make it like the games of the day we<br>wanted to use a fantasy game format we<br>wanted to make it very engaging<br>we drew not only on gaming technology<br>but also on eLearning theory and we<br>particularly drew on something called a<br>bi centric frame of reference which was<br>proposed by D D which actually says that<br>you can learn by emotion but you learn<br>better still if you can actually step<br>back and make sense of it so we landed<br>up with the two-phased game and you can<br>actually see that this here you will be<br>looking at the guide and the guide is<br>looking straight back at you so this is<br>a first-person game and the guide<br>interacts with the young person and he<br>will provide opportunity for screening<br>he will provide psychoeducation he will<br>provide challenges in the real world he<br>also provides choice so that young<br>people can screen to see whether or not<br>they've got problems that are likely to<br>be helped by sparks and then he offers<br>them a choice would you like to play<br>this game or would you like to do<br>something else and offers options if<br>they do if they choose the game it then<br>goes into a third-person format so you<br>can see here they can actually choose<br>the avatar the avatar is customizable by<br>skin color hair color hair styles the<br>trim on the clothes and so on and then<br>the avatar enters a fantasy world in<br>which there are a number of challenges<br>and the goal in this world is - the<br>world is beset with nets which are<br>gloomy negative automatic thoughts and<br>they need to be guarded by a circle of<br>power the circle of power has been<br>destroyed that gems are scattered to the<br>four corners of the earth and your job<br>is to go and find the gems and restore<br>the circle of power and to do so you go<br>through different provinces and each one<br>of these is loosely linked to the<br>cognitive behavioral therapy construct<br>so you deal with unhelpful thoughts and<br>with unhelpful emotions you overcome<br>problems along the way you find some<br>necks which have gloomy negative<br>automatic thoughts and you get to fight<br>those at the young men that we work oh<br>designing with<br>he wanted to shoot stuff we didn't want<br>anybody to die in a game for depression<br>so so we thought we that they could<br>shoot the nets and and also catch sparks<br>smart positive active realistic expected<br>Ott's having developed us we then wanted<br>to test it to make sure it worked and so<br>we did a randomized control trial and we<br>were very thrilled with quite a small<br>research team were then and we're very<br>thrilled when it was accepted by the<br>British Medical Journal and they liked<br>us so much they put us on the front<br>cover now I think until that point we'd<br>really thought that you know we're in a<br>tiny little country at the end of the<br>world and Silicon Valley's probably<br>doing it better but we attracted a huge<br>amount of international interest and we<br>actually realized at that point that we<br>were a bit ahead of the curve we won<br>some international awards we've got<br>quite a lot of media coverage and we<br>were feeling like the bee's knees<br>however no sooner had we done this then<br>the technology started a date and we had<br>to move it very quickly from the cd-rom<br>has anybody and everybody remember those<br>even onto the internet particularly<br>because at the time the Prime Minister<br>John Key had a youth mental health<br>project and he wanted to launch it as a<br>national program and it was launched in<br>April of 2014 and has been running and<br>is available free of charge in New<br>Zealand just on the internet you can you<br>can get you can get it by by just<br>searching for sparks and since then<br>we've been collecting data on its usage<br>and since it was released more than<br>18,000 people have accessed the website<br>and we've been able to keep those those<br>web views going because we've been<br>iterating as we've actually been going<br>and built into sparks as a as a system<br>to actually see whether or not it keeps<br>working so this is the pH QA which is a<br>measure of depression that's built into<br>sparks we built this from people with<br>mild to moderate depression we thought<br>the people with moderately severe and<br>severe depression should actually go and<br>see somebody but you can actually see<br>here that the no symptoms don't change<br>much you would expect that and neither<br>do the mild<br>the moderate people with moderate<br>depression improve the people with<br>moderately severe and severe depression<br>improved the most which was a bit of a<br>surprise to us and a bit reassuring<br>because at least half our users in the<br>moderately severe to severe group so<br>that was all great and if you remember<br>when I started when we when we set out<br>to develop this we wanted something that<br>would be really exciting and infuse<br>young people and we wanted the sort of<br>reaction the sad news is that we didn't<br>quite get it although we've got really<br>good completion rates within the trials<br>in the wild it doesn't it isn't the same<br>and we get quite a big drop-off at each<br>module so about two-thirds of people who<br>do each module do the next one so that<br>by level four we've got about eleven<br>percent of people completing and I guess<br>perhaps we shouldn't have been surprised<br>at this if you think about the number of<br>people who take up gym memberships then<br>don't follow through the number of<br>people who don't finish the antibiotic<br>courses and so on but I think that's one<br>of the challenges is going forward to<br>make it more sticky to use the parents<br>the other big challenge is the design<br>cycle so we started in 2003 we actually<br>designed sparks in 2008 we were going<br>quite fast to get the national rollout<br>in 2014 but we've had to really work<br>hard to try and keep up with technology<br>and we released a mobile phone version<br>now but we're getting a lot of feedback<br>that this is looking like a 2008 style<br>game and the way that you interact on on<br>phones is actually really quite<br>different from how you interact on<br>computers and so I'd like to spend the<br>second half of the talk actually talking<br>about where are we going to go to from<br>here and what might we think about and<br>we've been very fortunate to be part of<br>one of the national science challenges<br>very fortunate and also somewhat<br>challenged because it's quite a<br>difficult funding process but it has<br>actually given us access to funding to<br>allow us to think longer term and the<br>these challenges are funded by the<br>Ministry of business innovation and<br>employment and the idea here is that<br>researchers from across New Zealand get<br>together to collaborate to tackle some<br>of the big problems in New Zealand the<br>problems being tackled here in a better<br>start a cheaper area obesity literacy<br>and youth mental health and the use of<br>big data to inform and better care and<br>so we've got in this habits health<br>approaches through behavioral<br>intervention technologies and our vision<br>is that we would create a go to IT<br>ecosystem to improve health and<br>well-being for young people I sort of<br>trade me of health and well-being for<br>young people that's known within New<br>Zealand is the place to go we've got the<br>important thing from this is the<br>platform and this hosts things like<br>online screening to see if people have<br>actually got difficulty that could then<br>provide ongoing ongoing referral to<br>face-to-face therapy or could provide a<br>range of apps a smorgasbord of apps that<br>might help various problems and that<br>could then be monitored to combat the<br>problem of rapid development we could do<br>rapid online RCTs and then we can also<br>link to the national databases<br>particularly the integrated data<br>infrastructure which has been created by<br>States New Zealand to look at the<br>longer-term impact of some of these<br>interventions<br>co.design is really important we started<br>off Co designing with young people but<br>we now realise that Co design is a much<br>wider process and it's really important<br>to be thinking about how does that sit<br>in current health services what does the<br>gut what are the government priorities<br>what about families and communities and<br>that we need to really Co design with<br>developers and learn from them this is a<br>little group from a lovely group of<br>young people from One Tree Hill College<br>who've been helping us with the design<br>of our new apps and in the corner there<br>is Toni petróleo who's a Pacific<br>researcher system we've got two Pacific<br>and one Maori so we're also trying to<br>support development of the workforce in<br>one of our Co design workshops we've<br>decided we've discovered that young<br>people are different users so depending<br>on how old they are and whether or not<br>they have symptoms they want different<br>interfaces<br>so we've actually bought players or<br>gamers young people who who are pretty<br>much engaging you know like 11 12 13<br>year-olds pretty happy to engage as long<br>as you've got a game interface in<br>contrast older adolescents who might<br>have symptoms you say cut out that game<br>rubbish we don't want any games just<br>tell us like it is and then we can put<br>some help and then then we know what to<br>do<br>so what we're working on is youth chat<br>for screenings there's an online<br>screening that can be used in schools to<br>identify young people with the<br>difficulties and we've carried out a<br>visibility study comparing it with heads<br>which is an interview and we've actually<br>shown that's a very effective and<br>efficient young people like it so does<br>school nurses it helps them to triage<br>better we've actually built we're on our<br>second prototype of the platform and<br>we've got a lot of functionality in<br>there and we're looking to link it to<br>the Big Data project into this<br>integrated data infrastructure we've got<br>whole suite of apps here we've got play<br>kindly and super kids for parents of<br>young children preschoolers we've got<br>Carcano which is a project in<br>christchurch following the difficulties<br>some of the young children there have<br>ongoing mental health problems and the<br>parents want extra help that's five to<br>twelve year olds we've got an app and a<br>chat box for mental health and an app to<br>decrease risky behavior and these are<br>all being developed and we're trying to<br>run clinical trials for these over the<br>next 18 months or so to give you an idea<br>about what it looks like two-fifty young<br>at the crease is our app for emotional<br>health and this is the relaxation module<br>in this you go from island to island<br>again doing various things that you can<br>actually do on your phone and earning<br>money and being on the leader board and<br>things not real money money in the game<br>this is headstrong which is a chatbot<br>and I didn't even know what chatbots<br>were but apparently you access you can<br>get you can download these on your phone<br>but they can also enter things like<br>messenger so tracking where young people<br>are and what they're using is actually<br>quite a challenge<br>and so we're using chatbot for 15 to 18<br>year-olds these are sort of the more<br>skeptical young people with a cast of<br>characters to represent young people in<br>New Zealand and this will give us in the<br>future the opportunity to use machine<br>learning and artificial intelligence to<br>further develop these things this was<br>played kindly which is a project that<br>we've been doing linked in with the<br>Pacifica group and I don't know if<br>you'll recognize but this is actually<br>who's been involved in this project and<br>this is actually to support parents of<br>young children and this is Carcano this<br>is the Christchurch project that we've<br>actually been doing we need to integrate<br>it into services which I've talked about<br>before and we've been thinking about how<br>it's going to link into communities<br>how's it going to link into health<br>services how will it link into schools<br>so what I'd like to do is finish by<br>actually showing you a little video that<br>we've actually got that gives you an<br>idea about how we see it in practice in<br>it's common for young people to feel<br>stressed out or down mental health<br>problems affect at least one and for<br>young people there's about seven<br>students and an average-size New Zealand<br>class over half of these young people<br>don't let us support they need because<br>they find it hard to ask for help and<br>access services habits as a secure web<br>and mobile space where young people can<br>access digital screening and<br>intervention tools for mental health and<br>well-being it's based on proven<br>strategies that work for young New<br>Zealanders so how does it work meet a<br>donor she's just started high school it<br>Allah is nervous about being at a new<br>school<br>Idina lives at home with her farno like<br>many families they don't always see eye<br>to eye and editor finds it hard to talk<br>about what's going on<br>all of these worries are adding up and<br>she feels down a lot of the time<br>sometimes she cries in her room alone at<br>night she doesn't know what to do and<br>where to go for help so where does<br>habits come in it Anna's school has<br>signed up to use habits and all year<br>nine students are trying it out it<br>earnest starts with Chicot answering a<br>few questions about how things are going<br>for her<br>once she's filled it all in habits<br>responds with feedback on her scores and<br>gives us some options to move forward<br>the school nurse gets reports on all<br>their names who have completed Chicot<br>Edna's results show that she's feeling<br>down and so the school nurse makes a<br>time to see her the nurse and Ed and I<br>have a talk about what's going on at<br>home and school they work together on<br>what might help including choosing some<br>support people it and it chooses to tell<br>her dad about heavens internet agrees to<br>try one of the habits apps they start<br>the app together it looks helpful and it<br>Anna decides to keep using the app at<br>home on a phone at the end of the<br>activity Edna has the option to share<br>her progress with her support people it<br>Anna likes using the app and decides to<br>check out what else is on habits site<br>she finds other apps that look helpful<br>when but by but she starts to feel<br>better by using habits it in a school<br>have been able to identify other<br>students who are having a hard time and<br>support them to get help via the apps<br>the school nurse and other options the<br>research from the habits team can use<br>anonymous data to improve the apps that<br>way they can help more and more young<br>people to flourish with the support of<br>digital technologies obviously I haven't<br>done this on my own I'd like to<br>acknowledge Hamato Alfred Amati who has<br>snipped each sticker this way along with<br>me and my wonderful research team who<br>are enormous and I'd just like to<br>acknowledge all our funders and what<br>isn't here but we actually have a a<br>co-funding project with a MRF as well<br>within this so thank you very much<br>thank you<br>sadly that's a great start to the<br>evening our second speaker tonight is<br>associate professor Ricky Murphy Ricky<br>Murphy is an endocrinologist who works<br>in Auckland and Counties DHB she's an<br>associate professor in medicine at the<br>University of Auckland and a principal<br>investigator at the Morris Wilkins<br>Center for molecular bio discovery a<br>national center of research excellence<br>bring his research in diabetes and<br>obesity spans genetics Fazil physiology<br>and clinical research ricky is going to<br>speak to us tonight on diabetes and<br>obesity when one size does not fit all<br>thank you baby thank you very much Ellen<br>tena koe so tonight oh so tonight oh<br>sure Couture Manohar Lele namaste<br>greetings to you all I'm delighted to be<br>able to speak with you tonight on<br>diabetes and obesity two of the biggest<br>health challenges to face New Zealanders<br>like I just heard me projector on so we<br>all are aware of obesity we're not<br>particularly proud of being on the top<br>of the leaderboard for obesity around<br>the world we food and placed second to<br>Mexico and United States this is in<br>selected countries in 2009 and since<br>then our obesity rates have actually<br>continued to rise from about 10 percent<br>and then late 1970s to almost 1/3 of our<br>adults being a base in recent times<br>we're concerned about obesity because of<br>all the host of medical complications<br>from lung disease fatty liver coronary<br>artery disease diabetes and certain<br>cancers and the impacts that hairs on<br>quality of life healthcare and quantity<br>of life as well so we're aware of the<br>environmental drivers<br>of obesity in terms of the availability<br>of high caloric density of foods and and<br>mechanization and automation in the home<br>and in the workforce that means that<br>displaces the need for human labor<br>transportation communication and<br>electronic devices that all favour us to<br>consuming more and spending less<br>calories to some extent those of us who<br>are financially better off are able to<br>shield ourselves from the Sbisa genic<br>environment to some extent by making<br>time for physical activity and and being<br>able to prepare nutritious foods of<br>lower caloric density however it's not a<br>level playing field for other reasons in<br>terms of obesity in that there is<br>alterations and our genetic<br>susceptibility to obesity such that from<br>various international studies of<br>hundreds and thousands of people who<br>have had genetic analysis of the genes<br>show that people who are obese tend to<br>have variation in their genes that<br>control satiety or that feeling of<br>fullness and the brain and so what we<br>can conclude from that is that certain<br>people are more predisposed genetically<br>to overeating in the same environmental<br>influences when we look at obesity<br>treatments for quite some time we're<br>focused on personal efforts to exercise<br>and to eat differently and in order to<br>lose weight<br>there are several commercial weight-loss<br>programs like Jenny Craig and Weight<br>Watchers<br>there's also a range of very low calorie<br>diets and meal replacements that can<br>help as well as medications and<br>bariatric surgery so these are two of<br>the common forms of bariatric surgery<br>where you can see that the stomach is<br>either disconnected from the passage of<br>food or the ruin why bypass or a sleeve<br>gastrectomy where the majority of the<br>stomach has<br>removed and most of these are BCD<br>treatments unfortunately are very<br>difficult to sustain and maintain an<br>achieve weight loss and this is because<br>of the strong biological mechanisms that<br>we have to defend weight loss and to<br>some extent the master regulator is in<br>the brain in terms of integrating<br>signals from the gut from other organs<br>such as the pancreas and the fat itself<br>that tells us when the fact stores are<br>adequate and any efforts to decrease<br>meal frequency and size I met with a<br>whole host of adaptations that serve to<br>regain weight back to what what it was<br>and to some extent that is mediated by<br>genetic influences such that some people<br>have stronger adaptations to defending<br>weight loss than others so I think<br>obesity can be should be seen as a<br>disease and it's not simply a lack of<br>willpower that means that some people<br>aren't able to lose weight and it should<br>have the same degree of empathy as we<br>have for other diseases and so with that<br>I'd like to turn to diabetes and and the<br>prevalence of vet and diabetes in New<br>Zealand which was also rising at a<br>similar rate to obesity so in the last<br>12 years it's increased from about a<br>hundred and forty thousand people in New<br>Zealand to well over two hundred and<br>fifty thousand and New Zealand and most<br>recent times diabetes is defined as a<br>blood glucose above the threshold at<br>which the blood vessels are likely to<br>get blocked and hence the organs that<br>they supply are at risk of complications<br>so the cutoff for diabetes is a fasting<br>blood glucose above seven or a random<br>marker of glucose and the blood called<br>hba1c and a level above 50 and beyond<br>that there is a risk of micro vascular<br>complications that lead to retinopathy<br>or blindness kidney disease neuropathy<br>and medium-sized blood vessels and in<br>the brain causing strokes heart disease<br>and peripheral vascular disease<br>and the and the good news though and<br>diabetes is that there are several<br>glucose lowering treatments such that<br>people who are able to control their<br>blood glucose are able to lower their<br>risk of these complications pretty<br>effectively the range of treatments<br>however in terms of diet exercised a<br>whole host of tablets and insulin and<br>even bariatric surgery their effects<br>vary by the types of diabetes and it's<br>important to distinguish between type 1<br>and type 2 diabetes as the two main<br>subtypes in type 1 diabetes which is<br>actually causes about 5% of adult cases<br>of diabetes I mean the predominant cause<br>of diabetes and childhood is due to a<br>loss of insulin production and the<br>pancreas so this can occur at any body<br>weight it's not linked with for the<br>collectivity or diet and and really the<br>replacement of insulin is the only<br>treatment for type 2 diabetes which<br>affects the majority 90% of adult cases<br>with diabetes the risks of these<br>increase with age and increase with<br>increased body body fat gestational<br>diabetes has a similar etiology to type<br>2 diabetes affects 5 to 8% of women and<br>their pregnancies and it's generally<br>associated with excess body fat the<br>diabetes generally goes away after the<br>baby is born but those women are at a<br>higher risk of having developing type 2<br>diabetes later in life there's a number<br>of other very rare specific types which<br>we don't have time to go into but it's<br>important not to think that everyone and<br>adults has type 2 diabetes just a bit of<br>physiology on how blood glucose is<br>regulated here the master regulator is<br>an organ called the pancreas and this<br>senses blood glucose high blood glucose<br>particularly after a meal and so that it<br>releases insulin and responds to the<br>glucose insulin being the key hormone<br>that signals to the muscle and fat cells<br>to take up the glucose and restore<br>normal blood glucose levels in type 1<br>diabetes the specific insulin producing<br>cells and the pancreas<br>are destroyed usually through an<br>autoimmune process and there's a genetic<br>susceptibility with certain HLA or other<br>autoimmune type genes as well as the<br>second trigger usually a viral trigger<br>is thought to to destroy those those<br>beateth pancreatic cells and and that<br>leads to progressively high blood<br>glucose which is actually treated by<br>insulin that needs to be injected and<br>Tom Italy or infused through an insulin<br>pump and one of the difficulties with<br>insulin treatment and type 1 diabetes is<br>the need to sample blood glucose in<br>order to judge the right amount of<br>insulin to give and with recent advances<br>in technology there are some better ways<br>of monitoring diabetes and administering<br>those however these are very expensive<br>at the present time and we do hope that<br>that will reduce over the years and<br>contrast type 2 diabetes is actually<br>affects the muscle and fat cells in<br>there which become more resistant to the<br>effects of insulin and hence they don't<br>take up blood glucose the glucose well<br>there were also other defects and the<br>pancreas for example and other organs in<br>terms of controlling blood glucose<br>levels and these multiple defects arise<br>largely from an excess of fat cells and<br>they have again a genetic predisposition<br>with reduced pancreas function to<br>produce insulin as well as environmental<br>causes that determine weight gain and to<br>treat the multiple defects in type 2<br>diabetes we have a range of medications<br>to lower blood glucose as well as<br>insulin and bariatric surgery which are<br>very powerful ways of treating diet to<br>diabetes<br>however at this point we don't have any<br>tailored treatments for the type 2<br>diabetes medications and what we are<br>thinking about currently is that with a<br>certain medications such as Valda gluten<br>might be more effective and people who<br>have a weaker pancreas and ability to<br>produce insulin<br>type-2 diabetes while it's alternative<br>medications such as pioglitazone may may<br>be more effective and people in whom a<br>more obese and have high blood lipid<br>levels or cholesterol levels and we're<br>aiming to test this and by recruiting<br>people who with type 2 diabetes who are<br>willing to try these two different<br>medications and succession to measure<br>how well their control blood glucose<br>according to characteristics measuring<br>insulin production and and lipid levels<br>and body fatness so we're aiming to work<br>out whether we can predict glucose<br>lowering response to certain diabetes<br>medications using these characteristics<br>and to compare them but with various<br>genetic factors as well as variation by<br>ethnicity and in order to improve the<br>ability to treat people with type 2<br>diabetes in a more personalized way and<br>one of the interesting factors by<br>ethnicity is how obesity and diabetes<br>differs in New Zealand in different<br>ethnic groups so in this graph here you<br>can see that obesity prevalence is<br>highest and Pacific people in the green<br>bar here we're almost two thirds of<br>adults have obesity whereas in the<br>yellow bar here you can see that Asian<br>Asians and Indians have the lowest<br>prevalence of obesity in about 12%<br>we have intermediate levels and Maori at<br>almost 50% and 25% in Europeans however<br>when we turn to type 2 diabetes which we<br>know is related to body fat the levels<br>increase with age but we see the highest<br>prevalence of diabetes is affecting<br>Pacific and Indians in the orange so<br>green and orange refer to Pacific people<br>and Indian people and the lowest risk is<br>that and New Zealand Europeans that red<br>bar refers to those of Maori ethnicity<br>and it's interesting as to why this<br>might be and and much of us is thought<br>to be due to ethnic differences in body<br>fat so when we talk about obesity we<br>usually talk about a BMI or a<br>or a wait a courted by Heights<br>measurement of 30 and this corresponds<br>in Europeans and the blue line to a body<br>fat of 28% so basically this is a graph<br>inviting people of different ethnicities<br>and measuring their body fat and<br>relating it to their height and weight<br>measurements and you can see in the blue<br>cluster that refers to Europeans and<br>there's quite a lot of variation from<br>one individual to another<br>but overall the 30 the threshold of<br>height to weight of 30 corresponds to<br>about 28% body fat when we look in other<br>ethnic groups particularly Asian Indians<br>this a threshold of 28% body fat is<br>reached at a much earlier or slower BMI<br>so lower weight for height and contrast<br>specific people have reached 28% body<br>fat at a much higher BMI weight for<br>height and this is likely to be<br>genetically determined and there are<br>individual variations according to how<br>well people are able to store body fat<br>versus muscle mass versus bone mass at<br>any particular weight this highlights<br>the limitations of measuring obesity and<br>how we define it in simplistic terms we<br>use weight and height which are easy to<br>measure and you can each work out your<br>own BMI by taking your weight in<br>kilograms and dividing it by your height<br>in meters squaring that and a fuel BMI<br>is over 30 that's an estimate of obesity<br>that just indicates that you are likely<br>to carry excess body fat however this<br>doesn't apply to all ethnicities and the<br>inverse we may use judgments and the<br>street of who might be a beast and who<br>might not exert always reliable in terms<br>of of metabolic health many of our All<br>Blacks if we use the same weight and<br>height threshold of 30 to classify<br>obesity they would be a beast but in<br>fact their body fat percentage would<br>actually is actually quite low and and<br>that determines metabolic health and<br>type 2 diabetes which is not easy to<br>measure without doing more<br>expensive tests ideally mr MRI scans or<br>body fat scanners and contrast this<br>woman here probably if you measure on<br>the streets you'd think she was quite<br>slim but she happens to have a genetic<br>defect that means that even at a low BMI<br>she has very high liver and pancreatic<br>fat and has developed type 2 diabetes at<br>a very young age so so there are some<br>important caveats to how we assess<br>obesity one of the things that we've<br>been looking at and our researchers is<br>to look at the genetic susceptibility to<br>obesity and Maori and Pacific people<br>living in New Zealand and just over 2200<br>people have donated blood samples to<br>look at genetic variants that predispose<br>to obesity and what we've identified<br>recently is that a particular coding<br>change in a gene called crib RF where<br>there's an A instead of a G is present<br>and 30% of Maori and Pacific people this<br>gene variant is not found in any other<br>ethnic group that's been studied across<br>the world and what this a instead of G<br>gene change means is those carriers are<br>heavier approximately four kilos per<br>copy of that gene and surprisingly even<br>though they're heavier they have a 40%<br>lower risk of type 2 diabetes so that is<br>really interesting it brings us to doing<br>further studies which are currently<br>underway to assessing what this crib RF<br>gene variant means in terms of muscle<br>mass in terms of hormones regulating<br>appetite in terms of body composition<br>and so forth so we hope that this<br>information will help us tailor the BMI<br>guidelines and weight and type-2<br>diabetes risk for populations in New<br>Zealand<br>so to summarize I'd like to leave you<br>with the message that not all people of<br>the same sadi size have the same risk of<br>diabetes and there are genetic<br>differences between ethnicities and<br>between individuals as to how much and<br>where we store our body fat and in terms<br>of what types of diabetes we are at risk<br>of so thank you very much for your<br>fantastic lecture thank you very much<br>Frankie and uh I'll just be careful not<br>to suggest to one of the All Blacks that<br>they're obese quite a quite an<br>insightful point our third speaker is a<br>social professor Jeff Harrison Jeff is a<br>hospital pharmacist by training latterly<br>specializing in carrier vascular<br>intensive care medicine originally from<br>England Jeff was awarded a PhD in<br>surgery quite an unusual path for a<br>pharmacist perhaps but we're not trained<br>in evidence-based medicine at McMaster<br>University in Canada he moved to New<br>Zealand in 2001 taking up the post of<br>senior lecturer at the University of<br>Auckland in 2005 and became head of<br>School of Pharmacy in 2016 his primary<br>research interests are cardiovascular<br>disease diabetes comparative<br>effectiveness research and pharmaco<br>epidemiology and he's going to talk<br>tonight on people not potions the Reaper<br>thanks I'm I'm delighted to be speaking<br>to you today today of all days actually<br>in you probably didn't realize that<br>today is world pharmacist day so it<br>couldn't be more appropriate just in a<br>little bit of a change of pace what I'm<br>going to talk to you about today is<br>about the profession of pharmacy but I<br>will it towards the end be talking a<br>little bit about research and arguing<br>that the profession itself is the<br>intervention that we should be<br>interested in in applying to our<br>patients so when I say pharmacy you<br>probably think of this the dude maybe<br>he's not a dude the gentleman standing<br>behind the counter handing out pills or<br>maybe for some of the old people in the<br>audience maybe you think of this but<br>there's a serious point behind that<br>particular slide as well so what I'm<br>going to talk about today is where<br>pharmacy came from where we are now and<br>where we should be going as as an<br>intervention to improve the health and<br>wellness of New Zealanders so hold that<br>image in your mind so pharmacy and<br>medicine have a long and interdependent<br>history and in fact that was recognized<br>by professor Lewis when first setting up<br>the medical school on all those years 50<br>years ago when he envisioned that the<br>faculty would have a School of Pharmacy<br>and a School of Nursing that unholy<br>alliance but this pairing of medicine<br>and pharmacy has been around since<br>prehistoric times pre-written history<br>times and in fact this stone you see<br>here is found in a thesis in Turkey and<br>dates from the 10th century and what<br>you're looking at here is actually a<br>mortar and pestle and it was a matching<br>stone on the other side which represents<br>the staff of s collapse which is the<br>symbol of medicine and so they're often<br>seen as a pair and I've heard an<br>economist in the last two weeks argue<br>that without pharmacy medicine wouldn't<br>exist<br>but I think that might be stretching it<br>a little far in this audience but<br>fantasy has been around for a very long<br>time the first prescription first<br>written prescription was recorded in<br>1550 BC and if you look at different<br>parts of the world similar time lines of<br>the evolution of pharmacy have been<br>recognized and in fact the state's been<br>involved for a very long time as well<br>the first record of a state controlled<br>pharmacy heralds from Baghdad in Iraq so<br>a long history of medicine and pharmacy<br>together so where does pharmacy come<br>from so the modern pharmacist as we know<br>them has taken over the role of the<br>apothecary as was who was a medical<br>professional who formulated and<br>dispensed products from materia medica<br>that is the the herbs the plants the<br>roots that were then used by the<br>physicians the surgeons and their<br>patients so as well as dispensing herbs<br>and medicines the apothecary also<br>offered general medical advice there's a<br>story developing and a range of services<br>that are now we see performed by doctors<br>in a British view of this there's an<br>event in 1704 where apothecary<br>apothecaries divided into what we now<br>know as general practitioners who treat<br>patients and what we now know as<br>pharmacists who prepare that medicines<br>and the case went that an apothecary was<br>sued by the College of Physicians in the<br>High Court for having the brass neck of<br>visiting a patient at home prescribing<br>and dispensing medicine for that patient<br>the College of Physicians felt that this<br>was completely inappropriate and took<br>the Apothecary to court unfortunately<br>for the college<br>the court had agreed with the apothecary<br>largely on the basis that this was<br>custom and practice that physicians were<br>rare and charged too much<br>there's an interesting parallel with<br>today where pharmacists are now working<br>in general practices seeing patients<br>prescribing treatments and dispensing<br>medicines not this time because general<br>practitioners are too expensive but they<br>are too few so this is one of the<br>emerging roles of the modern pharmacist<br>so what then happened so we had a path<br>Korea's pharmacists emerge from now<br>what's happened since then well as being<br>technological change when we think about<br>medicines we no longer think most of us<br>no longer think about compounded herbs<br>we think about the tablets that rinky<br>showed you the injections so industrial<br>pharmacy led to the creation of<br>pharmaceuticals into those products as<br>we know them to be distributed by<br>pharmacists that specialist knowledge<br>that pharmacists held about how to make<br>drugs became lost from the high street<br>where it had been remember thinking back<br>to the Victorian pharmacy that was where<br>the pharmacist compounded products for<br>an individual patient they made a<br>consultation decided what the patient<br>needed compounded it there and then and<br>sold it to them a professional service<br>whereas now increasingly fascists were<br>seen as distributors of products that<br>were ready prepared Frances remained the<br>medicines expert but their daily<br>activities the daily activities of being<br>a pharmacist are perceived to be the<br>distribution of a product this<br>unfortunately hides the real role<br>because what goes along with handing<br>that box of medicine to you is the<br>assessment of whether that's the right<br>medicine for you whether it's the right<br>dose whether it is in the right<br>formulation for the individual but I<br>would argue that the profession has had<br>a little bit of a crisis of confidence<br>around its professional identity and<br>what it's there to perform and I think<br>some of the profession and some of the<br>the public's perception of what pharmacy<br>is has been has been caught up in that<br>so when I say pharmacy what I think is<br>this and you'll notice in these images<br>yes in one of the images<br>as a product or a row of products behind<br>but what I actually see is pharmacist<br>interacting with people and I think this<br>is really what we're seeing starting to<br>emerge again is the value of the<br>pharmacist and the pharmacist knowledge<br>no longer about the product but about<br>the interaction with the person and<br>about ensuring that the right individual<br>therapy for that patient and I see one<br>of my colleagues in the room who's a<br>brilliant example of a community<br>pharmacy a high street pharmacy that<br>that provides all of these services<br>right now the value of this emerging<br>role has been recognized by governments<br>they've started to talk about not<br>valuing the distribution of medicines<br>you may know for those of you who read<br>the papers that Amazon has just spent a<br>billion dollars in acquiring a<br>distribution network for pharmaceutical<br>products in the u.s. it was interesting<br>to read Sydney Morning Herald's response<br>to that which was there's going to be a<br>crisis in Australia in Australian<br>pharmacies and Amazon is going to take<br>over there are two reasons why that's<br>not going to happen one of which is to<br>do with GST being charged in to Amazon<br>in Australia and the other is the fact<br>that Australia and New Zealand have<br>fundamentally different healthcare<br>systems to the US and there's less money<br>to be made from the distribution of<br>medicines in that way but that sort of<br>technological change I think will be<br>empowering for pharmacists Frances are<br>now moving to and this is the research<br>part of the presentation pharmacists are<br>now moving to providing patients<br>professional services extended services<br>and I'm just going to talk to a few<br>examples from my own area of interest<br>cardiovascular disease and diabetes so<br>they're now being 39 randomized<br>controlled trials a pharmacist LED<br>management for hypertension as opposed<br>to general practitioner LED management<br>of hypertension when comparing those two<br>interventions with a pharmacist without<br>a pharmacist<br>you see an average systolic blood<br>pressure reduction of seven point six<br>millimeters of mercury that's better<br>than any single drug where pharmacists<br>are able to not only just assess the<br>patient and make recommendations to the<br>general practitioner but they're<br>actually able to enact that change<br>themselves you see an average reduction<br>in blood pressure systolic blood<br>pressure of nearly 20 millimeters of<br>mercury there's extraordinary so this<br>big change in in in blood pressure how<br>does that translate in terms of patient<br>outcomes so they've been some studies<br>done looking at how many strokes that<br>would save how many heart attacks that<br>would save and also whether that would<br>be cost-effective<br>clearly you've got to pay the pharmacist<br>to run this service right and you're<br>already paying GP so by adding a layer<br>of cost that's going to cost more but<br>what that analysis shows not only is the<br>treatment being the pharmacist more<br>effective it's actually more cost<br>effective as well and it's been said<br>that it would be unethical not to fund<br>this if this was a drug we would have<br>general practitioners lobbying the<br>Minister of Health we'd have the general<br>public in the street demanding that<br>Pharma paid for it and yet it's not<br>funded here and it's considered to be<br>something that we don't necessarily want<br>to do again I've heard it said it would<br>be unethical not to fund a service like<br>this similarly they've been randomized<br>controlled trials of pharmacists led<br>care versus usual care for diabetes<br>management specifically around glycemic<br>control using existing treatments so not<br>new treatments just using the treatments<br>we have better and an average reduction<br>in that study of nearly one percent or<br>ten millimoles per mole and the hba1c<br>and as rinky showed you that translates<br>directly into reductions in retinopathy<br>reductions in nephropathy cardiovascular<br>events there was also an attendant<br>reduction in blood pressure and<br>associated lipid levels LDL cholesterol<br>and triglycerides that often go along<br>poor glycemic control as well and that<br>don't directly translates into improved<br>patient outcomes again this is just<br>adding the pharmacist as an intervention<br>to the existing healthcare system and<br>then talk a little bit about<br>anticoagulation management so many of<br>you will have come across you'll know<br>somebody on warfarin might even have<br>taken it yourself or used it to kill<br>rats one or the other is a commonly used<br>medicine it has some interesting<br>pharmacokinetics and interesting<br>pharmacodynamics so different people<br>need different doses but the same person<br>will need a different dose from time to<br>time as well so they're quite comp is<br>quite a complicated drug to use when<br>pharmacists and Murray was one of them<br>in in the pilot study when pharmacists<br>see patients and manage warfarin as<br>opposed to general practitioners<br>outcomes improve what this graph shows<br>is this is the distribution of blood<br>test results so you may have seen or<br>heard of an INR so and I we if you're<br>not taking warfarin you're iron I would<br>typically be about one so normal<br>clotting the higher the number longer it<br>takes your blood to clot ideally when<br>you're treating somebody with warfarin<br>you should be aiming for an INR of about<br>two and a half somewhere between two and<br>three is acceptable above three the<br>patient is at risk of bleeding<br>side-effects below two they're at risk<br>of of clotting abnormal clotting which<br>might cause a stroke heart attack or or<br>a blood clot in the leg a DVT so this is<br>the distribution of the amount of time<br>that an individual spends in the correct<br>range in that range of two to three this<br>is usual care what happens in most of<br>New Zealand this is what happens when<br>you put a pharmacist in charge of<br>selecting the dose and tailoring the<br>dose to the individual ideally the<br>International gold standard would be to<br>spend more than 60% of time in the<br>correct range<br>so what you see here is turns out<br>pharmacists are quite good at this<br>there's an increase in the time in<br>therapeutic range of nearly 17 percent<br>importantly there's a 15% increase of<br>sorry at 15% decrease in the amount of<br>time a patient spends below the required<br>therapeutic range at risk of stroke but<br>also there is a reduction in the amount<br>of time that the patient spends in the<br>bleeding risk in the above three level<br>as well so why is it that pharmacists<br>are good at this turns out with pretty<br>good at pharmacology now there may be a<br>hematologist in the room there's not a<br>lot that I could tell a hematologist<br>about how warfarin works you know that's<br>that's their area of expertise they will<br>understand that there is genetic<br>variation in V course c1 particularly<br>amongst Asian populations which means<br>that the variation in dose is about 30%<br>due to that one gene alone they'll also<br>understand that the wayne warfarin is<br>metabolized through 2d6<br>has a genetic variation that's<br>responsible for about 10% of that change<br>in dose I'm not going to tell her<br>hematology as much about how warfarin<br>works<br>turns out warfarin has lots of drug<br>interactions it also interacts with lots<br>of foods including turmeric which<br>probably not a lot of hematologist would<br>know just off the top of their head<br>turns out pharmacists are pretty good at<br>pharmacology and that's why when things<br>go wrong or when the patient has a<br>complicated drug therapy we are in a<br>position to perhaps make better<br>judgments about whether to adjust the<br>dose or whether not to it may be to do<br>with the fact that we also have more<br>time we don't just have those six minute<br>consultations that GP is unfortunately<br>seem to have to manage through this<br>service has been funded across New<br>Zealand and they're about eight and a<br>half thousand patients that are<br>currently in this service but there are<br>about thirty thousand patients on<br>warfarin so there is a shortfall so<br>there are a number of people that are<br>not getting this service again I would<br>argue Maria I'm sure has got a waiting<br>list for her CPM service and I know<br>certainly know their eye areas in the<br>so everything old is new again Pharmacy<br>is in an exciting transition face<br>pharmacy professions always talking<br>about being at the crossroads I<br>sometimes feel that it's roundabout<br>rather than a crossroads but there has<br>been a shift from a product focus to a<br>patient focus pharmacies are harnessing<br>technologies to automate some of those<br>processes around dispensing so<br>dispensing robots that can reduce time<br>and cost in getting the product to the<br>patient which then allows the pharmacist<br>to spend time talking with the patient<br>identifying their problems and<br>individualizing their therapy the<br>profession is also recapturing its space<br>as the medicines experts we've talked a<br>little bit about potentially different<br>responses to different treatments based<br>on an individual's genetic profile or<br>predisposition integrative medicine I<br>don't know whether you know what that<br>means<br>integrative medicine is really combining<br>traditional therapies maybe traditional<br>Chinese medicine wrong Pacific medicines<br>with what we lovingly termas Western<br>medicines often patients want to be able<br>to take both together in order to be<br>able to do that safely we need<br>pharmacists and pharmacologists to be<br>able to understand how those two<br>approaches to treatment interact<br>pharmacists therefore become those<br>knowledge brokers there to support their<br>medical and nursing colleagues and<br>others and specifically their patients<br>understanding and using<br>existing therapies better just very<br>briefly what defiance's study when I<br>went to university I studied all the<br>things on the left we did a lot of<br>physiology immunology pathophysiology<br>pharmacology in spades I did two solid<br>years of pharmacology what I didn't do<br>any patient assessment I didn't learn<br>clinical reasoning until I was treating<br>patients and having to work it out<br>critical thinking I could think<br>hopefully I did a bit of critical<br>thinking I didn't learn anything about<br>communication skills I didn't learn<br>anything about behavioral therapies<br>we're actually starting to teach our<br>students right now these skills I didn't<br>learn anything about teamwork until a<br>Thursday night in the butter market in<br>Shrewsbury when I had to interact with<br>my medical and nursing colleagues over<br>half a pint of mild we do I did learn<br>about evidence-based practice and I did<br>learn about research methods but mostly<br>that was looking down a microscope or in<br>a test tube rather than clinical trials<br>with patients our fourth year students<br>are leaving University with all of these<br>skills equipped to deal with the general<br>public and with patients to understand<br>their needs and ensure that they're<br>getting the right treatments so just to<br>finish on the place of pharmacy in the<br>future is very much in a one-team<br>approach working with doctors nursing<br>nurses other pharmacists providing<br>person-centered we and interplan<br>interdisciplinary healthcare I think we<br>do have a role in managing long term<br>conditions I think we can reliably and<br>I've demonstrated through evidence that<br>we can at least as well as is done now a<br>pharmacist can take on that role and<br>arguably do better I think we can<br>harness technology to individualize<br>health solutions across the country but<br>only as part of their integrated team<br>and sharing information so thank you for<br>your time<br>another remarkable lecture thank you<br>Jeff I have a user of community pharmacy<br>in this respect that I can confirm that<br>it's a fantastic way to deliver<br>medications our last speaker is<br>Professor John Fraser John Fraser is<br>Dean of the Faculty of Medical Sciences<br>at the University of Auckland

into immunology at<br>Harvard University he returned to New<br>Zealand as the inaugural Wellcome Trust<br>UK senior fellow in medical science he<br>received a personal chair in molecular<br>medicine and 2000 and was made a fellow<br>of the Royal Society of New Zealand in<br>2005 for his work on super antigens John<br>has a long-standing interest of immunity<br>and infectious diseases and

graduate and<br>doctoral students John is a strong<br>advocate for the role of science and<br>society and the importance of research<br>led teaching in medical education his<br>lecture tonight is entitled new<br>initiatives in rheumatic fever and I<br>think he's also going to tell us about<br>in a manner<br>Narelle and how wafer-thin akuto tena<br>koutou tena koutou katoa Thank You Ellen<br>slightly long-winded introduction I<br>think that was taken from a bio I had<br>many years ago yes I am indeed the Dean<br>of the Faculty and it's my very great<br>pleasure to pretty much finish this<br>wonderful lecture series that we've had<br>as part of our 50th anniversary<br>celebrations before I start I'd just<br>like to acknowledge all the work that's<br>gone into this lecture series and the<br>work that the distinguished producer Ian<br>Reed has put into what I have believed<br>has been an outstanding lecture series<br>in tonight's lectures notwithstanding my<br>lecture which I haven't given you I<br>think have been outstanding and I hope<br>that I can at least express a little bit<br>of my interest in a field which I feel<br>doesn't get a lot of attention in New<br>Zealand infectious disease but it is<br>equally important and of course I'm<br>hopefully I'll be able to convey some of<br>their importance to you tonight so<br>although my talk is entitled new<br>initiatives and rheumatic fever it<br>really is only a part of my talk I'm<br>really going to talk about a more<br>general topic and that is superbugs<br>superbugs have always been an interest<br>to me they are a fascination maybe<br>somewhat ghoulish fascination because<br>they do cause a great deal of concern<br>they are the cause of a considerable<br>disease quite disparate diseases across<br>New Zealand and of course in this<br>country we have a very significant<br>disparity in the diseases that these<br>bugs caused between Maori and Pacific<br>particularly in a young as opposed to<br>non-marring and non pacific and<br>rheumatic fever is a very very good<br>example of how as a country we still<br>have a major third world disease problem<br>which has essentially been eradicated in<br>other countries first of all countries<br>such as the UK North America and Europe<br>both Australia and New Zealand have a<br>very significant problem still<br>the high rates of rheumatic fever that<br>occur in a young Maori and Pacific<br>children so what is a superbug superbug<br>is not every boat there are some very<br>nasty bugs out there that cause very<br>serious illness but they're not<br>superbugs because they're easily treated<br>you can drink foul water on water and<br>end up with cholera caused by an<br>organism that lives in the water you<br>probably find it in the history of<br>Auckland but it's not a super bug<br>because color is very easy to treat it's<br>easy to identify and it doesn't occur in<br>epidemics or pandemics superbugs really<br>are characterized by bugs that are able<br>to change their makeup the genetic<br>makeup to resist any attempt to try and<br>destroy them of course we all know that<br>antibiotics have been the mainstay of<br>the treatment of organisms such as the<br>ones I'm going to talk about tonight but<br>at the those antibiotics are beginning<br>to fail more and more and of course just<br>recently you will have noted those of<br>you who've been listening to the news<br>the appearance of a new form of<br>drug-resistant intra eye in New<br>Zealand which is essentially resistant<br>to all major forms of antibiotics and<br>that organism is essentially here to<br>stay although it's an umbrella tively<br>small number of our population it will<br>continue to grow over the decades and<br>the question is how fast will it grow<br>and how much disease it will cause that<br>well we will be unable to treat with our<br>current repertoire of antibiotics so<br>superbugs typically are recognized by<br>their ability to try to resist<br>antibiotics they are very difficult to<br>treat and then talk about one organism<br>particular which is probably the most<br>difficult to treat they have high rates<br>of community transmission which means<br>that they are in the community will read<br>people in this room will be carrying<br>these bugs without knowing it and for<br>most of us they don't actually cause an<br>illness it's when the immunity barrier<br>has broken down and those bugs are able<br>to establish a colony or an infection<br>within the body and then that<br>fiction is not controlled by our immune<br>response that it then becomes a florid<br>infection and causes very serious<br>disease and often death they are the<br>constant cause of disease the ones that<br>I'm going to talk about these two<br>organisms here<br>Steff aureus I'm sure you've heard of<br>staph aureus and strep pyogenes<br>constantly cause disease in New Zealand<br>and this one in particular causes old<br>widespread variety of diseases and as<br>the organism which probably is best<br>suited to change its genetic makeup to<br>be resistant to pretty much all forms of<br>antibiotics and of course New Zealand we<br>are unique we have certain strains that<br>prevalent in this country that you don't<br>see in other countries which makes it<br>slightly more difficult to develop<br>strategies to combat these particular<br>strains this organism here is an other<br>gram-positive organisms called strep<br>pyogenes it typically lives in the<br>throat and the nasal passages and<br>sometimes lives on the skin it's another<br>gram-positive organisms and this is the<br>one that causes rheumatic fever but it<br>also causes a number of other conditions<br>so this is really just a summary of some<br>of the nasty conditions that these<br>organisms cause Steff aureus causes a<br>number of this is probably the most<br>common these two here abscesses and<br>impetigo that predominantly skin<br>infections the organism gets under the<br>the upper layers of the skin and causes<br>an infection so in here you'll have a<br>small colony of staph aureus growing and<br>you can see the immune response around<br>this is becoming quite prevalent so it<br>becomes hot and hot to touch very<br>sensitive and that simply means that<br>your immune response is trying to rid<br>the body of that growing colony of staph<br>aureus the problem of course is that<br>organism has defense mechanisms to stop<br>your immune response from working and in<br>individuals where that immune response<br>fails that organism can then become<br>systemic it can get into the bloodstream<br>and you can experience a very severe<br>often fatal condition called septicemia<br>Staphylococcus septicemia in Patito we<br>see on children it's really just a skin<br>infection which is relatively easy to<br>treat but the way in which we treat it<br>has caused a very significant problem<br>which I'm going to talk about in the<br>next upcoming slides toxic shock a<br>relatively rare condition which is<br>caused by staph aureus not limited human<br>cows get mastitis that's also caused by<br>staph aureus that the strains that cause<br>mastitis are different from the strains<br>that infect humans and cause disease<br>cellulitis is really a more severe form<br>of this where the organism has started<br>to spread into the lower forms of this<br>part of the skin and into the soft<br>tissue underneath then into the muscle<br>and that is a very very severe condition<br>and if left untreated the patient is<br>very likely to die this is the guy that<br>worries us the most it's called mr sa<br>mrs a stands for methicillin-resistant<br>Staph aureus and it's a strain of<br>bacteria which has become very prevalent<br>worldwide which is really the poster<br>child for super bug it is the one drug<br>one organism that has become very<br>difficult to treat and of course the<br>rates of mrs a infection in new zealand<br>becoming increasingly problematic<br>particularly those infections that occur<br>in what we refer to as<br>community-acquired so they occur out in<br>the community rather have been in the<br>hospital hospital acquired infections<br>are slightly different from those that<br>occur in the community settings such as<br>aged care facilities well and those<br>community acquired infections are often<br>much more difficult to treat but this<br>little bug here<br>amara say is a major cause of morbidity<br>and mortality worldwide now in us a very<br>very severe problem and it's got that<br>way because it's become resistant to the<br>mainstay of antibiotics which the<br>penicillin based antibiotics of which<br>methicillin is a classic form we have<br>high antibiotic how high antibiotic<br>resistance and staph aureus and of<br>course the problem is that it has a very<br>high asymptomatic carriage which means<br>about twenty to thirty percent of the<br>people in this room at the moment are<br>carrying steph horus in the upper areas<br>the interior narrows of the nose up and<br>here so it's very very easy to spread<br>this organism is the one that causes<br>rheumatic fever strep pyogenes and<br>rheumatic heart disease you're probably<br>familiar with strep throat I'm sure many<br>of you have had a strep throat often<br>really easy to distinguish between a<br>standard viral infection<br>because it hurts like me and there<br>that's because your tonsils swell up to<br>such a size that you can really have<br>it's almost impossible to to swallow but<br>of course you get a systemic and fix you<br>get a high fever you feel very unwell<br>and that's because the organism growing<br>in these tonsils are releasing these<br>virulence factors which are causing<br>quite significant systemic effects that<br>make you feel very unwell also causes<br>scarlet fever this common in New Zealand<br>that it used to be like rheumatic fever<br>this is the particularly nasty form of<br>strep infection where it's got into this<br>soft tissue and into the muscle<br>cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis<br>often referred to as flesh-eating<br>bacteria the only solution here is<br>really amputation because the soft<br>tissue has really just been destroyed by<br>this infection and rheumatic fever is<br>one of these significant problems that<br>we have a museum because it is a disease<br>of poverty and overcrowding so most of<br>the key cases of rheumatic fever in New<br>Zealand are associated with playing<br>young Maori and Pacific children who<br>live in low socio-economic areas such as<br>South Auckland and other areas where the<br>transmission rates of this organism are<br>very high and the treatment rates are<br>very low and often the condition is left<br>until the rheumatic fever has developed<br>to a point where there has been<br>permanent damage done to the heart<br>valves of the valves of the heart<br>thankfully strep pyogenes is still fully<br>sensitive to penicillin<br>so it's relatively easy to treat you<br>just give a dose of penicillin and<br>within 24 to 48 hours the the infection<br>has has been eradicated I grew the day<br>when we discover a antibiotic version<br>the resistant version of his strep<br>pyogenes I hope I'm not around when that<br>day comes<br>so mr SI is the classic poster child of<br>the superbug family<br>methicillin-resistant Staph aureus we<br>know it arose sometime in the 1970s from<br>Brazil we have records that date back<br>that way and of course now with genetic<br>techniques and careful screening we can<br>go back and look at the genomes and the<br>organisms that are ROS so it often is<br>ciara with infections in the lung and on<br>the skin it causes information of the<br>heart muscle bone and joints and also<br>causes particularly in the US for some<br>reason a very severe severe form of<br>necrotizing pneumonia so it gets into<br>the lungs and it starts to eat away the<br>lung tissue and that's a very very<br>severe infection so half of<br>staphylococcal infections in the USA now<br>due to methicillin-resistant Staph<br>aureus and they are resistant to<br>penicillin methicillin tetracycline and<br>erythromycin so really they've only the<br>only way you can treat them is with long<br>treatment so the antibiotics antibiotics<br>that are only used as last resort<br>community quite mr saye is on the rise<br>and New Zealand quite significantly and<br>it is a problem one of the great<br>mysteries of course is that some people<br>develop em RSA and if only forms a mild<br>or treatable skin infection whereas<br>others succumb to a very severe invasive<br>form and it's almost impossible to treat<br>now those of you who understand<br>microbial genomics and genetics the<br>classic strain in the u.s. is called USA<br>300 it has some certain prototype<br>genetic features that we refer to and<br>these are often what we look for when we<br>screen and new infections in New Zealand<br>to see if this prototype in Marseilles<br>has made its way to New Zealand shores<br>and really one of the great questions is<br>what is it about this strain which makes<br>it so infectious it's not just that it's<br>able to resist methicillin it carries a<br>gene which actually destroys penicillin<br>based antibiotics that's not the reason<br>why it's so severe and we still don't<br>understand why an infection of EMR say<br>causes such invasive difficult to treat<br>well of course it's difficult to treat<br>because it doesn't respond to<br>antibiotics but the types of infections<br>that cause up a particularly severe so<br>I'm going to get to the Musil and<br>situation now and this is research that<br>was done by a group particularly by a<br>PhD student who was working in our group<br>in the<br>from 2012 through 2015 deep williamson<br>and this is really a study which looks<br>at what types of staph aureus clones are<br>appearing in New Zealand and what are<br>the predominant disease-causing strains<br>now I realize that this is probably a<br>complex slide it's not meant to be it's<br>really just to reflect that Debbie<br>looked at over 3,000 disease-causing<br>strains or clones that have been<br>isolated from various patients around<br>New Zealand and she did a genetic<br>analysis of all of those clients and she<br>just was discovered that in fact 36<br>percent of them and this was across the<br>entire population in New Zealand were<br>represented by only three particular<br>unique clones one two and three here in<br>the aspartic this is just a way in which<br>we identify and you can see that each of<br>the three clones are different this this<br>particular claim which is the most<br>common thankfully it's still sensitive<br>to methicillin misses methicillin<br>sensitive staph aureus which means it's<br>still easy to treat with standard<br>antibiotics this is also sensitive but<br>this one here in our assay is resistant<br>to peasant penicillin based antibiotics<br>the most important discovery that<br>they've made was the fact that each of<br>these three strains was resistant to<br>another antibiotic called fuse siddik<br>acid so 36 percent of the strains in New<br>Zealand are now few siddik acid<br>resistant now if you said 'ok acid is<br>not a particularly important antibiotic<br>in the hospital setting we don't use it<br>in the hospitals we use penicillin and<br>tetracycline and are from ice and all<br>the powerful antibiotics a few CITIC<br>acid as an antibiotic that's used<br>particularly to treat mild skin<br>infections so most of you will have had<br>a skin infection where you've gone to<br>the general practitioner and he's<br>prescribed an ointment where you rub on<br>that infection and that treats it and<br>that's usually if you said okay sir<br>20 years ago these three clones did not<br>exist in New Zealand so where did they<br>come from and why well the simple fact<br>is that 20 years ago January 1998 few<br>siddik acid was first prescribed as a<br>treatment for skin infections and this<br>is the prescription rates of few siddik<br>acid in New Zealand you can see a steady<br>climb so this is community<br>the dispensing rates per a thousand<br>population per month is now up to by<br>January 2012 missus continued to climb<br>this is a tube of foam and I looked an<br>our cabinet at home and we have a tube<br>of foam and sitting in the cabinet<br>this is Pacific acid so the reason why<br>these three clones have appeared and<br>these are three very difficult to treat<br>clones is because we've been using few<br>CITIC acid too much it's been used<br>prescribed for skin infections that has<br>caused the staff for us on our skins to<br>develop few siddik acid resistance and<br>that has caused the establishment of the<br>scoobys three strains and now they have<br>become the predominant disease-causing<br>strains in new zealand so this is a<br>clear lesson and how over prescription<br>of antibiotics for really treatments<br>that probably could have been treated in<br>other ways has led to a very significant<br>problem this is a lesson and how fast<br>antibiotics selection and resistance can<br>occur in a population such as New<br>Zealand this is another antibiotic new<br>person which is also used for skin<br>infection and interestingly the rates of<br>prescription have stayed relatively the<br>same in fact they've gone down a bit so<br>really the reason why this has increased<br>was really marketing drug companies have<br>marketed this to general practitioners<br>general practitioners have seen patients<br>have had a mild skin infection the<br>practitioner has decided well I'm not<br>going to test to see if it's def aureus<br>or something else I'll just prescribe fo<br>ban and you can get it across the<br>counter as well and people have used it<br>and if the consequence has been that<br>within about 20 years we've got three<br>strains which are all resistant a few<br>psittacosis<br>so that is a lesson in in how quickly<br>antibiotics can cause these very<br>significant and very problematic strains<br>to appear and they're now essentially<br>here to stay<br>so one of the questions we have and i'm<br>an immunologist by trade is whether<br>vaccines are a logical solution to<br>treating antibiotic resistance because<br>of course antibiotic resistance has been<br>around for millions of years<br>bacteria antibiotics essentially have<br>come from fungi<br>I finally get infections just like we do<br>and finally over millions of years have<br>produced these molecules which interact<br>and destroy the bacteria or destroy the<br>ability of the bacteria to grow we've<br>used these compounds for the last 60<br>years very effectively but of course<br>that's starting to fail us so what is<br>the other solution well the only other<br>solution we have because infectious<br>disease is not going to go away is to<br>look at vaccine approaches because<br>vaccines are still very effective in<br>treating infectious disease however with<br>staph aureus it's been a bit of a<br>problem because Steff for us also<br>doesn't respond particularly well to<br>staff vaccines that's not to say that I<br>don't believe step vaccine for staph<br>aureus might work it's just that the<br>number of vaccines that have been tried<br>clinically have all failed and this is<br>really just a reflection of the failure<br>of a number of very important vaccines<br>that were developed these two by a<br>company called nabi steph x failed even<br>though it showed very good promise in<br>animal studies there the stem x which is<br>based on a cell surface molecule on the<br>surface of our staff forests really<br>showed no effect in clinical trials they<br>modified that and that was also failed<br>and shelved another vaccine that was<br>tested in clinical trials around the<br>world<br>called Paquime AXA babe nabbed was<br>failed really didn't show any efficacy<br>another company inhibit X or excess<br>produced another vaccine which again<br>failed in clinical trials and their most<br>publicly or the one that caused the<br>greatest interest was this very publicly<br>touted vaccine called v7 one team by the<br>company moog which looked like it was<br>really going to work all the animal<br>studies appeared to be very effective it<br>was based on a single molecule on the<br>surface of stepha is called the IsdB<br>protein which is on all strains of staph<br>aureus and in animal studies that look<br>like if you're vaccinated with this<br>particular protein and got good<br>antibodies against it<br>then the animals were entirely protected<br>from for<br>infection by staph aureus so it went<br>into phase 2 and phase 3 clinical<br>studies particularly in the u.s. and<br>cardiac units whereas cardiac units have<br>problems with staphylococcal infections<br>most surgical units have problems with<br>the staph aureus infections but cardiac<br>units are in particular notable for the<br>problem in having post surgical<br>infections due to staph aureus the trial<br>was ended when it was discovered that<br>the vaccine actually increased the death<br>rate amongst those who have exited by a<br>factor of 5 fold so that told us that<br>vaccines don't always work in fact they<br>do quite the opposite they actually<br>enhance the ability of the organism to<br>grow because the vaccine we now know<br>actually protected the organism rather<br>than caused it to be more susceptible to<br>immune attack and surprisingly that<br>study was halted immediately has that<br>put an end to vaccines for steroids I<br>don't believe so and certainly my group<br>has a real interest in developing<br>alternative vaccines which don't<br>actually work the same way as that that<br>Merck vaccine based on there are<br>inspectors that we know through a lot of<br>work that we've done very very important<br>in the initial colonization of tissue by<br>staph aureus so the idea is that by<br>vaccinating with these immobilized<br>virulence factors there is a quite<br>unique to staph aureus that you can tell<br>about an antibody response that then<br>protects the patient from further<br>infection from colonization so my vision<br>is that a vaccine will be useful in all<br>surgical settings people who are going<br>in for elective surgery or cardiac<br>surgery would be vaccinated 2 to 3 weeks<br>or a month before the surgery so that<br>they are at less risk of developing that<br>post-surgical infection which is such a<br>problem around the world so we are<br>actively working on this and we have a<br>project grant from the Health Research<br>Council to develop such a vaccine so I<br>did want to talk a little bit about<br>rheumatic fever it's still a problem in<br>New Zealand we are working very hard to<br>develop strategies to deal with<br>rheumatic fever<br>you're probably aware that over the past<br>10 years we've had a very major program<br>run by the Ministry of Health which was<br>really to screen a primary prevention<br>program in high-risk areas where young<br>people if they had a sore throat they<br>would be seen by the the public health<br>nurse in the school the nurse would swab<br>the throat and give prophylactic<br>antibiotics to those children who<br>presented with a sore throat it was a<br>very expensive exercise I think<br>government's been about 80 million<br>dollars in total on this prevention<br>program and was really to try and stop<br>the infection of the throat by strep<br>pyogenes before it occurred using<br>penicillin as the prophylactic<br>antibiotic I have to say that it wasn't<br>particularly successful because the the<br>rates of transmission in those<br>communities is too high and unless you<br>get every single child that it's<br>carrying strep pyogenes then really a<br>primary prevention program it's<br>expensive as it is to run really does<br>not provide the efficacy in small<br>communities that's been shown to work<br>because you can get every child in that<br>community but in larger communities such<br>as South Auckland unless you vaccinate<br>every child at risk sorry if you treat<br>every child with penis on<br>prophylactically over a long period of<br>time those rates of rheumatic fever are<br>not going to go away or not going to<br>produce so we have been working with our<br>colleagues in Australia to look at the<br>development of a vaccine for strep<br>pyogenes this is a little bit more<br>developed than the vaccine for step for<br>step for us and this is really just a<br>slide looking at all of the partners<br>that are involved in this very<br>significant program which has been named<br>canvas it's the coalition to develop<br>novel vaccines against strep pyogenes<br>it's primarily involved ourselves<br>University of Auckland myself and<br>Jonathan Cara Peters who's the director<br>of the telephone institutes and kids it<br>was really started by former Prime<br>Minister John Key who asked me one day<br>at a meeting what it would take to<br>develop a vaccine against strep pyogenes<br>I said ten million dollars<br>and he went away and said well I'll see<br>what I can do so he then spoke to the<br>Prime Minister of Australia at that time<br>and they developed a program which was<br>funded on both sides of the Tasman to<br>look at fast tracking vaccines that was<br>four years ago and after a lot of work<br>we've identified a number of vaccines<br>that we think should be likely ripe for<br>clinical trials and the one that we are<br>looking at most seriously is this a<br>vaccine that's been developed by a<br>company GlaxoSmithKline which is a<br>complex vaccine which has been well<br>developed through the developmental<br>program it's a vaccine which is has four<br>components to it and we've been working<br>very closely with GSK with the intention<br>of a clinical trial beginning in<br>Australia and New Zealand hopefully<br>within the next two years so that the<br>vaccine is currently under development<br>to GMP manufacturing stage at that stage<br>we're hoping that New Zealand and<br>Australia will be the first sites for<br>this clinical trial for this vaccine<br>that's not to ignore the fact that that<br>associate professor Thomas prophet and<br>Auckland here is also developing an<br>alternative vaccine based on another a<br>potential antigen which I think also has<br>significant developments so there's a<br>lot of work going on looking at a<br>vaccine approach my future for New<br>Zealand and Australia will be that<br>simple vaccinations and children at risk<br>and we know where these children are<br>they're in South Auckland they're in<br>poor irrora they're in the western part<br>of the North Island and Northland<br>they're in schools we can identify them<br>and we can vaccinate them relatively<br>easily so we are hoping that the the<br>trials that are due to start within the<br>next two year will show that this<br>vaccine is at least some way if Acacia<br>s-- in reducing the rates of<br>streptococcal infection that would<br>suggest that it will also be effective<br>in reducing the rates of rheumatic fever<br>in this country so I've presented a<br>somewhat grim tale of antibiotic<br>resistance and superbugs my two favorite<br>organisms strep pyogenes and staph<br>aureus<br>there is really no solution yet<br>particularly in rheumatic fever with<br>strep pyogenes but there is a shining<br>light on all of us you're probably all<br>worried like everybody else about<br>antibiotic resistance and the<br>development of superbugs and what we're<br>going to do about it the one problem we<br>have is that over the last 60 years<br>there'd be no new antibiotics that have<br>been developed all the antibiotics that<br>have been developed are different<br>modifications of the same old antibiotic<br>so the classic penicillin that was first<br>discovered by Alexander Fleming has<br>simply been modified over and over again<br>to try and overcome the resistance<br>that's developed against it so most of<br>the antibiotics that are used today are<br>still based on what we referred to as<br>the lactam antibiotic molecule it's been<br>a problem of course because we haven't<br>discovered any new types of antibiotics<br>just recently however and this was a<br>very celebrated paper that occurred in<br>nature was a very clever and fellow<br>called Kim Lewis decided to look for<br>organisms that had never been seen<br>before and what he did was he made this<br>little cell and he planted it in mud in<br>his back garden and in these cells<br>he made the summary that the organisms<br>that had never seen before would only<br>grow under the conditions that they were<br>used to ie in mud and so he actually<br>cultured these things in these cells in<br>the conditions that they were most used<br>to growing and he discovered this new<br>organism called Eleftheriou ti-ti being<br>earth and it produced a new compound<br>called Takeo Becton and this is the<br>compound for those of you entered a<br>molecular structure it looks nothing<br>like the lactams it's a completely new<br>structure and it is very powerful<br>against all gram-positive organisms<br>including mr sa and vancomycin resistant<br>staph for us so this is a real shining<br>light for the future and of course<br>there's a lot of work going on now to<br>try and repeat these this work in other<br>areas to identify other new organisms<br>that are producing other very<br>interesting antibiotic molecules there<br>in theory should have no resistance<br>against them because they are so<br>completely<br>and quite rare so with that I'd like to<br>finish I'd like to thank you all for<br>coming along tonight and I guess now is<br>the time for a few questions we are out<br>of time so I would like to just<br>acknowledge that over the years we've<br>had that very generous support from the<br>Health Research Council and of course<br>the Maurice Wilkins Center that I've<br>been a member of for many years and of<br>course the canvas funding that we<br>received from both Australia New Zealand<br>has really supported a lot of the<br>research that we've done like the last<br>ten years thank you thank you John I<br>think that was a remarkable final<br>closing lecture in this 50th anniversary<br>series of lectures we do have gifts for<br>the for the speakers I think we've had<br>remarkable presentations tonight all of<br>them very professional very interesting<br>and very varied but I think more<br>importantly than the gifts if you could<br>join me and again expressing our<br>appreciation for what I think has just<br>I'd also like to thank Jasmine barber<br>for the organization either you at the<br>top for the organization tonight thank<br>you for that and again thank you all for<br>coming every pie her Cora rope I caught<br>a mare Nui karma 2pi hockey pi are two<br>key tequila nor era terracotta<br>terracotta terracotta guitar good night<br>to all of you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
