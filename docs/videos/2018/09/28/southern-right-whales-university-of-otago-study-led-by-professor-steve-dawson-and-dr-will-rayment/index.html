Their colouration making the task of recording them easier for Marine Science PhD student and UAV operator/pilot David Johnston.<br>“They really stand out from the surface. They look almost luminous, making them really easy to track,” Mr Johnston says.<br>This pigmentation pattern occurs in around three to four percent of calves, nearly always males, and is caused by the expression of a recessive gene different to that which causes the typical black colour. The white pigmentation usually darkens as the animal grows older, developing into a mottled grey colouration.<br><br>Music: “Betterdays” by Bensound, www.bensound.com</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so we're gonna answer the Auckland<br>this time of year they come into Shore<br>and - they're carving habitat and the<br>Auckland Islands is the primary carving<br>grounds and we're studying the recovery<br>of the population they were heavily<br>impacted by whaling they were almost<br>wiped out from New Zealand altogether a<br>little remnant population hung on in the<br>7th Arctic's and they've been recovering<br>since commercial whaling finish so we<br>can track individuals through time and<br>so photographing individuals and<br>photographing them and recognizing them<br>again year after year we can study lots<br>of things about the population like<br>population size survival rate how<br>frequently they come back and have their<br>curves and this enables us to to chart<br>so the other tool we've been using<br>within the last three years is aerial<br>photogrammetry so with the development<br>of drone technology were able to get<br>really really good aerial images looking<br>straight down from above the whales we<br>can calibrate those images and we can<br>measure the whales really precisely so<br>we can measure their body lengths and<br>also we can measure their body condition<br>essentially how fat they are and we're<br>looking to see how healthy they are how<br>health this recovering population is<br>these animals also feed on zooplankton<br>copepods and other krill which<br>themselves feed on phytoplankton which<br>is essentially the powerhouses of the<br>ocean so there's a really small linked<br>chain between the whales and primary<br>productivity so by tracking changes in<br>body condition through time we can get<br>an idea of what's happening through time<br>in the Southern Oceans productivity so<br>the white cast we saw this year are a<br>normal feature in right whale<br>populations um however it's still<br>relatively uncommon and only occurs in<br>about three-and-a-half to four percent<br>of populations and instituted the<br>expression of a recessive gene and seems<br>to only occur in males now they don't<br>stay white throughout their lives as<br>they grow although these individuals<br>will actually get darker they'll never<br>reach the complete black coloration<br>patterns of the rest of the population<br>but they do reach a mottled kind of gray<br>coloration which is really useful for us<br>and remember it means they remain<br>strikingly obvious err through to<br>adulthood and allows us to identify them<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
