it's our<br>pleasure to begin the award ceremony I'm<br>just going to be the housekeeper if<br>there's an emergency<br>we'll go to the back doors and stand<br>outside and on the edge of the street<br>also if you're an award winner there is<br>a blue mark for you to come here and<br>stand on so that we can actually see<br>your face this year we noticed everyone<br>last you when they came and got their<br>awards this is all we saw of them we<br>want to see your best side so please<br>come and and face everyone as you're<br>giving your award department heads if<br>you're here please come stand on the red<br>mark because we would really like for<br>you to be able to that's not the danger<br>mark be able to actually hand your your<br>staff member the award we feel it would<br>be really wonderful to have your<br>involvement in the ceremony along with<br>Ralph and Barry this year there are any<br>questions before we begin all right<br>Ralph good afternoon welcome I'm sure<br>many of you familiar with the meeting of<br>this sort where we really acknowledge<br>top performing teachers these are people<br>who've gone out of their way and have<br>been rated very highly by their peers<br>and by the students and also this year<br>we have people have provided innovations<br>into teaching and perhaps haven't<br>themselves been at the coalface these<br>sort of awards are pretty common at<br>every medical school all around the<br>world and there is a little bit of<br>literature on them in medical education<br>literature and they're usually people<br>usually justify them by saying well it's<br>one way of thanking our teachers and<br>it's also considered to be a way of<br>engaging other teachers I'm not sure<br>that there's any evidence that that's<br>true but anyway that's that's the theory<br>behind it so we'll be acknowledging our<br>teachers and you'll be hearing about<br>each and every one of them why they've<br>got their award and you'd be able to<br>acknowledge them personally but I<br>actually want to talk about the other<br>teachers who didn't get the award lost<br>about five weeks ago we're all nervously<br>facing the AMC Australian Medical<br>accreditation body who was at our<br>University and I was kind of worried how<br>our students would have come across now<br>look everyone knows that reproduce<br>really really good graduates and that's<br>down to our teachers but for the IMC is<br>that you actually have to show what<br>you're doing to get there and I was a<br>bit worried that we wouldn't have all<br>our teachers coming to the meetings but<br>they excel themselves and they blew the<br>IMC accredits is a way the sort of words<br>they used when describing them were<br>collegial enthusiastic dedicated I can't<br>tell you exactly what the result of that<br>is but I'd be really really disappointed<br>if we didn't get a 10-year accreditation<br>I think we're going to do really really<br>well from it so the question then comes<br>up is who contributes to that well it's<br>all the teachers who contribute to that<br>this year I'm sure the All Blacks are<br>going to be the world champions again<br>and there would also be a ceremony where<br>the players of the year are awarded<br>prizes two or three people did<br>particularly good jobs but you now know<br>that they didn't get the position they<br>are with two or three players and so I<br>want to acknowledge all the people who<br>didn't get an award but who really<br>helped us in every other way including<br>with the accreditation so I'm going to<br>stop now I don't have to do anything<br>more but I really would like you to<br>8j fan or jenna koto katoa amy nui ki<br>our control die look at the title has<br>been on discussion about the title of<br>today's session and it's been okay the<br>because these are teaching awards but in<br>fact I thought they probably should be<br>encouragement or teaching encouragement<br>of learning or what was rather than a<br>teaching award because from my point of<br>view good teaching requires both<br>curiosity and enthusiasm and most<br>students really respond to enthusiasm<br>preps the most of anything but the more<br>I thought about it the more it seemed to<br>me that curiosity and enthusiasm is not<br>enough and that in fact the key<br>attribute of a good teacher is actually<br>empathy and respect for students that<br>enables the student to actually learn an<br>environment that encourages them to<br>actually be a bit like the teacher like<br>if you've got a good family they will<br>actually teach by example and that<br>example needs to respect that the<br>student and the environment which their<br>imminent and demonstrate I guess respect<br>for the patient so without that you will<br>actually have Nikki if you have a<br>negative influence in other words you<br>are bullying or disparaging of the<br>student you actually set up a negative<br>environment that actually turns its<br>student off and that's the opposite to<br>being a good teacher<br>so we're increasingly aware of those<br>issues over the last four or five years<br>so I want to pay tribute to the people<br>who actually respect and have empathy<br>for students in this particular occasion<br>I think the people that have been chosen<br>and selected by the students are few by<br>some others actually<br>demonstrate those particular attributes<br>nor era genic autogenic or job Couture I<br>wanted to pay tribute to the prime<br>minister who said she wished she was the<br>first Prime Minister to be able to speak<br>fluently in Tahrir and I can't so I'm<br>both but also acknowledge the negative<br>message that came that if you're a a<br>presenter on TV or on radio and you<br>mispronounce Maori I think you're likely<br>to be dismissed from your job which came<br>up this week if you listening report so<br>I'm very nervous with using any marine<br>okay so we're not going to have a long<br>session we're hoping to be finishing<br>fairly soon so with the first Dunedin<br>campus awards are coming straight up<br>trading into an award for excellence in<br>teaching Daniil Bly okay going up the<br>line house officer Award for Excellence<br>in teaching the awardee is dr. Richard<br>McLeod going again up at the knotch to<br>nursing team Award for Excellence in<br>teaching a particularly important one<br>the nursing team in this particular year<br>okay registrar Award for Excellence in<br>teaching dr. Jeremy Wong and finally the<br>senior medical officer Award for<br>Excellence in teaching dr. Paul Trani<br>always nice to give somebody in my own<br>discipline thank you very much now that<br>actually leads on to actually a guest<br>presentation by the one for thank<br>you<br>while my mark can you hear me<br>yota I was asked to give some some words<br>about teaching about what it means to me<br>and I consider it and considered it and<br>considered it and then I asked my wife<br>who's much smarter than me and she well<br>I wrote down my brainstorming um I don't<br>know what to say I don't know what to<br>say I don't know what to say<br>say thank you that's her writing so I'll<br>try off' Atty kkeok way I hope I<br>did that justice I am I'm really quite<br>honored to be here<br>to stand in front of you to use five<br>minutes of your time on a Wednesday<br>afternoon to talk about something I<br>absolutely adore when I was in medical<br>school and watching the lecturer parade<br>back and forth in front of the podium I<br>thought to myself I wanted to be there I<br>wanted to help I wanted to do that I<br>wanted to be the person who sort of<br>figured out how to do it and when I<br>moved here to New Zealand five years ago<br>and I was informed that I was going to<br>be teaching I was really excited and<br>then I was informed I was going to be<br>teaching behavioral developmental<br>medicine which is something I love and<br>something I do and something I really<br>had a hard time figuring out how am I<br>going to teach what's in my head and I<br>can't say I figured it out I can't say I<br>get can give anybody any advice but what<br>I can give you is an anecdote that I<br>think leads to a point that I'll make<br>I'm a geek huge geek I love it a geek<br>out in various ways I won't go into the<br>ins and outs of it but I've been known<br>to<br>a convention con for those of you who<br>are in the speak a time or two there's a<br>specific convention that takes place in<br>the United States around this time of<br>year actually it's the first weekend in<br>September it's called Dragon Con Dragon<br>Kahn's convention it's known for one<br>specific thing in America cosplay which<br>some of you might recognize but for<br>those who don't recognize it it's just a<br>amalgamation of the words costume and<br>play cosplay is very very common at<br>Dragon Con in fact it's basically the<br>reason for Dragon Con people are just at<br>our wars characters and Starfleet<br>officers from Star Trek and hobbits and<br>dwarves and whatever is the movie of the<br>moment that year the very first year I<br>went to Dragon Con was the year that 300<br>the movie was out in the movie theaters<br>that summer and so in the lobbies of the<br>Hilton the Hyatt the Ramada and one<br>other big H named Hotel in downtown<br>Atlanta Georgia where Dragon Con takes<br>place you had a hundred different guys<br>running around dressed up like<br>gladiators from 300 some of which<br>shouldn't have been dressed up as<br>gladiators from 300 you had all sorts of<br>characters from any walk of life<br>mainstream geek related movie you had<br>hobbits you had dwarves you had ents<br>guys on stilts walking around the lobby<br>as trees it's a four-day convention I<br>was there for all four days after four<br>days three days really at the convention<br>I was in nerd two costume I didn't see<br>it any more I couldn't see it the people<br>that I see walking around dressed up his<br>armored Knights was just Oh from room<br>405 down the way the person dressed up<br>is you know a fuzzy Ewok was my friend<br>Larry didn't see it<br>you also out of sleep so that might have<br>had some<br>to do with what would happen next I was<br>down in the sub-basement to of Hyatt<br>central doing something Iggy I finished<br>up my session I get into an elevator I'm<br>gonna go up to my hotel room be freshen<br>up I haven't taken a shower in two days<br>so I'm getting and then come back down<br>to the lobby and see what else has gone<br>on I get the elevator elevator goes up<br>one or mmm on to the elevator comes<br>older guy kind of overweight salt and<br>pepper beer loud weather flanked by two<br>guys with dark sunglasses dark suits one<br>white one black I'm no slouch<br>I said cement it say it out loud but I<br>was like ah it's a good costume where's<br>this little starts up community<br>have a brain flash I'm like oh of course<br>so I tapped the guy in loud sweater on<br>the shoulder and I said hey man<br>great George Lucas costume he doesn't<br>even turn around and it around his neck<br>goes like this it shows me his badge<br>which announces that it is George Lucas<br>I just touched the big George Lucas gets<br>off his two bodyguards get off and one<br>of them goes like this elevator door<br>closes I use that still to this day to<br>remind me to not lose the forest for the<br>ents to not lose the forest for the<br>trees in something that you love doing<br>I love teaching I don't want it only to<br>be an environment like this don't to be<br>only in an environment where sitting or<br>standing in front of a crowd of wrapped<br>people who have to a<br>or their phones or their laptops or<br>asleep I want to teach all the time and<br>that's times leads me to around clip<br>chronically running 15 to 20 minutes<br>behind because I can't stop talking<br>about this really interesting thing but<br>I think it's really interesting and<br>maybe the student with or the person<br>who's shadowing me finds it interesting<br>but I'd like to think that in in some<br>way passing on my love for this field<br>that I participate in is part of my<br>responsibility so much in the same way<br>that George Lucas did not engage with I<br>want to engage and not lose the forest<br>for the trees when it comes to teaching<br>and so that's the that's I mean if I<br>were to give you any advice whatsoever I<br>would say just don't lose the<br>opportunities that are right there in<br>the moment and the next time you see<br>George Lucas in the wild ask him why Jar<br>Jar Why Why Jar Jar lock I will say<br>there is a postscript to this what long<br>story if you don't you don't believe my<br>story<br>there is evidence three months after<br>DragonCon I was phoned by a friend of<br>mine and said Paul you're on television<br>friend of mine who is at DragonCon with<br>me Paul you're on television like I'm<br>not on television he's like no no Robot<br>Chicken put you on television Robot<br>Chicken for those of you who may or may<br>not be aware is a Adult Swim cartoons<br>show where they basically take action<br>figures or claymation and they make fun<br>of pop-culture things they did a Star<br>Wars Episode or Christmas time in 2007<br>there is a George Lucas convention<br>related sketch where someone who is bald<br>and has dark frame glasses comes up to<br>him and thinks he is not George Lucas at<br>this convention and tries to make fun of<br>him George Lucas on the writing staff<br>for that particular Robot Chicken<br>episode<br>I'm in George Lucas's head that's my<br>story thank you so we have online from<br>our campus in Invercargill hopefully our<br>so sit Dean down there and now he's not<br>here just register on a house upstate<br>okay so welcome to the teaching awards<br>for ALM at the jeannine School of<br>Medicine and which you're obviously part<br>of so in the absence of

Andrew<br>Moore great picture there Andrew are you<br>there yes we just knock that off so hi<br>Andrew hey do you want to say word or<br>two no no I just thank you<br>I'm very nice and short and guys just<br>cut off again okay great thank you for<br>your work and finally it's a senior<br>medical officer Award for Excellence in<br>teaching for the Invercargill campus is<br>dr. Animesh Chatterjee and I don't think<br>he's down so we'll acknowledge it and<br>he'll get us that since in the post so<br>that takes us to the student reps bin<br>Watson and so shuka you are here to come<br>hello okay so we've been asked to<br>discuss briefly from the students voice<br>are now perspective for what makes a<br>great teacher I like to share my<br>anecdote so I like to share an<br>experience with the consultant who I<br>would consider an inspirational teacher<br>to me and one of my role models this<br>consultant to me epitomized empathy he<br>was able to break down the power<br>distances for these patients and walk<br>beside them through their journeys he<br>was able to flatten the historical<br>hierarchy among his students and<br>included them within the discussion with<br>the patient I remember fondly that<br>between each outpatient it would wipe<br>out without his whiteboard marker<br>scribble on the whiteboard and discussed<br>the care of that patient I felt like his<br>colleague as we would challenge each<br>other's knowledge and importantly he<br>sought deficit deficits in my own<br>knowledge base for us to discuss on this<br>drove me to not just read up about the<br>core knowledge but delve into the<br>literature which meant our discussions<br>elevated to discussing clinical Mansion<br>management in reference to the current<br>literature I do not believe this<br>experience is unique to myself or<br>exclusive to a consultant but also house<br>officers TI's nurses and many more I<br>believe we all have had role models like<br>this along our journeys they've<br>challenged us to do more and inspired us<br>to become who we are today it is<br>important to recognize these great<br>teachers as they are not represented by<br>hospital key performance indicators like<br>the number of patients seen or surgeries<br>carried out but by their impact in<br>shaping future doctors in the years<br>ahead<br>okay I'm still shaken fourth year<br>medical shoot and also on the education<br>rate for this year so in my role I've<br>started to realize how important<br>education is for all of the students<br>here at medical school and I've started<br>to realize how we're taught in a huge<br>variety of ways so not just in a<br>tutorial setting but also especially in<br>a Liam you're taught when you are<br>walking between patients when<br>you are and the you know walking in the<br>corridors or if you're waiting for your<br>coffee these are all opportunities where<br>you get taught so it's quite important<br>to engage with students and sort of any<br>opportunity that you can get so it's<br>hugely important to recognize how the<br>good teachers and we need to realize<br>what a positive impact this has on<br>students because not only do we and<br>learn a lot from these people but we<br>also make quite a lot of career choices<br>based on these teachers as well and<br>because it has such a big impact on what<br>we think about a particular specialty so<br>um with that in mind Ben and I quickly<br>just came up with sort of a very non<br>exhaustive list of what makes a good<br>teacher so and so someone who listens<br>someone who is passionate but I guess<br>that comes up just naturally someone<br>who's engaging and inclusive someone who<br>has very clear key messages that you um<br>they want you to take away someone who<br>figures out what are the gaps they need<br>to build before just talking about it in<br>general and someone who knows how to<br>pitch the information in the right level<br>so since the influence of teachers<br>extends beyond the classroom well into<br>the future we sincerely want to thank<br>every one of you for being such great<br>teachers and including the ones that<br>didn't get Awards today so thank you<br>know me so we now move to departmental<br>Awards and as they come up the heads of<br>departments would come and make a<br>statement about the awards and why<br>they've given the awards and then our<br>award so I'm not sure they do all the<br>instant partners are here so bioethics<br>so do you want to announce it and then<br>I'll give it the bioethics alien teacher<br>goes to dr. Simon Walker now the reason<br>why Simon got the award this year is<br>because of his dedication to to teaching<br>and engaging with students and working<br>alongside clinical staff to to really<br>perfect as teaching and to provide the<br>very best of environments for student<br>the general practice I don't think so so<br>I'll go straight forward to the award<br>from general practice so the award goes<br>to dr. Kristen Kendrick Kendrick and the<br>statement that goes with this is she's a<br>senior lecturer and general practice is<br>the module convener for fourth year and<br>Co convener for the 60 attorney engine<br>attachment she's highly rated by her<br>peers and students the quality of a<br>teaching and also for the leadership<br>that she shows in the department's<br>undergraduate teaching program we used<br>to be neighbors but that's got nothing<br>to do with us<br>okay so Nix is the Department of<br>Medicine and Michael Schwartz is coming<br>Shing students so who knows scream<br>Hammond choke we could say this is a<br>lifetime of water because Graham has<br>been with us for about 30 years now and<br>he's been heavily involved in teaching<br>for 30 years so I wasn't here 30 years<br>ago so I don't know how you guys taught<br>30 years ago Graham would tell us that<br>it was a big mess and it needed<br>improvement it needed constant<br>improvement I think that's one of the<br>reasons why we choose Graham to receive<br>the award because he stepped on and he<br>kept going with the teaching he<br>innovated the teaching constantly in the<br>area of neurology and he is still a<br>fantastic teacher and he still left left<br>by his students he still left by his<br>peers and that's why the Department of<br>Medicine decided that Graham Hammond<br>talk should get our departmental of<br>water Thank You Graham he will come and<br>doesn't matter<br>and Susan jack is a public health<br>medicine specialist who's been convening<br>the AL in public health attachment for<br>several years now and has really taken<br>it in hand and reshaped it and<br>introduced a number of innovations<br>including a global health classroom<br>which involves the students linking in<br>with students and the Medical School in<br>summer to learn from each other in<br>several other innovations which have<br>really been very well received by<br>students and Susan's student evaluations<br>are amongst the best we've ever seen in<br>this attachment and getting better so<br>it's fantastic to have her on board and<br>sorry I didn't do something prices right<br>okay thank you very much okay<br>Department of surgical Sciences and is<br>Mark here in which case shall I announce<br>and go<br>the surgical Sciences departmental<br>teaching Awards as the person who has<br>been a longtime convener involvement in<br>it dr. Andrew mr. Andrew Aldo nice<br>picture<br>I'm happy to present this war to a<br>shaman lang who's one of our og<br>registrar's many of you may not have<br>encountered her because she's only been<br>here for a few months time and what's<br>incredibly remarkable she hasn't had a<br>lot of formal teaching opportunities<br>within our courses as far as tutorials<br>her teaching is mostly in the clinical<br>arena and with trainee interns at the<br>end of every trainee intern run we ask a<br>the students to remark who was the top<br>teacher that influenced your learning<br>and since she has come here she's only<br>one that's really mentioned which is<br>really incredibly remarkable and I<br>suspect that while she's here no one<br>else is gonna win any teaching Awards as<br>she does that just but by making them<br>feel like such a part of a team and<br>seeking out and and paving the way for<br>them to have learning opportunities in<br>the clinical setting<br>and taking the time I know gee registrar<br>there aren't many people in the hospital<br>who are busier than they are so to be<br>able to to make the environment that<br>that the students feel like they're<br>being given a significant portion of<br>their time is very very remarkable and I<br>think it's it's outstanding and you know<br>certainly a deserving recipient of this<br>award that is the yeah and thank you<br>very much for all those we're now having<br>a dis presentation from the clinical<br>stills team<br>No<br>Oh<br>um good afternoon good evening thank you<br>for asking me to say some kind and wise<br>things about Paul this first award<br>you'll probably get 50% of that so we'll<br>see how we get on and I've got to start<br>by chastising the other poll for asking<br>it's better half as to where to start a<br>speech or at all I mean I did what any<br>self-respecting academic would do and<br>that head straight for Wikipedia there's<br>a few things I didn't know about<br>Medeiros first of all it originates from<br>northern Portugal known worth waa<br>worldwide nights named Madeira<br>participated in ending the Moorish<br>subjugation of Iberia as well as<br>fighting the Spanish in order to<br>maintain Portugal's sovereignty the<br>Madeira<br>heraldry and coat of arms is genuine and<br>well known so Paul clearly has some very<br>important and regal genes to carry on<br>into the work he does for us now the<br>other thing some of you may well know<br>about Paul is that he's a very keen fan<br>of Star Trek so he's a trekker I'm not a<br>Trekkie as chastised currently they're<br>not Trekkies or trekkers and I was<br>thinking about how I was gonna link this<br>in to say a few words about Paul and I<br>thought which character in the in the<br>series sort of most if it's Paul and<br>there can only be one<br>it's got to be Spock as a couple of<br>reasons for that clearly the the the<br>love of mustard colored jumpers is high<br>on the list but there's a few other<br>parallels which I think are quite<br>important as well<br>Spock is half human half Vulcan and that<br>paradox was quite difficult for him so<br>I'm led to believe and Paul has a<br>paradox of working half for the DSM and<br>half for the DHB<br>and that is a job which is clearly very<br>very difficult it's a balance which is<br>difficult to strike he's got two masters<br>in the skills lab and it's it's a work<br>he does exceptionally well he knows he<br>who does work with the PD who works with<br>Mel and the SD HB team to make sure we<br>give a good service to the HB whilst<br>also working with the<br>Dean's Department the School of Medicine<br>to make sure the students get as good a<br>deal as possible<br>now this difficult because the skills<br>lab is in greater than a hundred percent<br>demand and Paul negotiates and navigates<br>that with great aplomb the other thing<br>of course Spock has is his the console<br>and the Starship Enterprise and you've<br>seen that photo of Paul already with his<br>computers and his ex-girl Excel<br>spreadsheets and I think this is<br>something which is worth commenting on<br>certainly for the junior doctors and<br>medical students amongst you the need<br>for clinical governance and clinical<br>audit is paramount but what is most<br>important in that is you owning your<br>data if you own the data and you ask the<br>questions and you can get the<br>information you need for the best care<br>of your student best care of your<br>patient exactly the same parallel in<br>teaching you need to audit teaching you<br>need to understand what you're doing and<br>teaching and as part of that therefore<br>you need to own the data and Paul does<br>that with multiple screens and many many<br>spreadsheets and can tell us exactly<br>what's going on the skills lab what the<br>call on resources are and where we need<br>to add extra resources and extra support<br>the Lea spoke has got Captain Kirk and<br>Paul has got Oh had and Spock's role is<br>too late Captain Kirk do his job and<br>there's no question that Paul allows Oh<br>had myself to run the teaching side of<br>things and he does the work a bit like<br>you know the old idea of a duck<br>moving on serenely on the surface Oh had<br>and I are the serene surface people<br>Paul's a fellow who's doing all the work<br>underneath and making these things<br>happen making sure that the for example<br>the the recess courses have got the kit<br>required so they're ready to go first<br>thing in the morning I think it's it's<br>really important to remember how much<br>work goes into setting up simulations<br>and putting them away setting up the<br>days in skills lab and Paul does all<br>that with a smile spoke unflappable<br>logical intelligent had pointy ears well<br>I'll accept the poll is unflappable<br>logic moderately intelligent and I'm not<br>going to comment<br>on the ears the only one thing I would<br>say of course is that he supports North<br>FC which Spock would say was illogical<br>undoubtedly so Paul can I just get you<br>to come down and receive this award I'll<br>leave you this quote I'll let you guess<br>oh if I'm allowed an anecdote the last<br>award was actually sinful in my book as<br>a result of the accreditation visit<br>where I'm somewhat nervously they said<br>well I was nervous when they said we<br>want to go to schools wish and so I went<br>over and I was astounded about the sort<br>of spaceship like efficiency just to use<br>the right analogy then to the whole I<br>guess area was running and that<br>contrasted really quite markedly two or<br>three years ago we have two further<br>special awards one is actually a<br>regional center teaching awards and I do<br>have something to be done the the person<br>receiving this award is Kirsty Merle<br>McMillan and she is a rural nurse<br>specialist and professional practice<br>fellow based in the Newcastle and<br>involved with our fourth and fifth year<br>program she was instrumental and sitting<br>up the end of the carve us a 5048 urban<br>GP module centre and since then has done<br>and contributed an enormous amount of<br>work with GPS and that local in the<br>cargo area and delivered a significant<br>chunk of the tutorial teaching for the<br>catchment in general practice down there<br>she has them over to home for meals she<br>arranges various outings for them such<br>as Mike baiting and flounder fishing<br>with her husband she encourages the GPS<br>to include students and their peer<br>groups and other similar events and was<br>recently acknowledged by the GP<br>community for what they see as their<br>part from the increasing number of new<br>GPS coming to Invercargill so she<br>deserves this award as regional center<br>teaching<br>now our last award is going to be<br>introduced by Microsoft right no I can't<br>yes I thought you would yeah okay so<br>realize we're just about positions<br>refreshments outside so the last award<br>of the evening is to dr. Steve Johnson<br>for innovation and teaching yes thank<br>you very much very much very fast me to<br>present this last award on innovation<br>and teaching to my colleague Steve<br>Johnson so some of you might say well<br>he's just handing out the award to his<br>body's buddies because he's also a<br>gastroenterologist and I happen to be<br>one as well but that's actually not the<br>case Steve came to us as a senior<br>lecturer a couple of years ago and he's<br>one of those senior lecturers where you<br>use definitely need a person who kind of<br>makes the other half of you in your<br>gastroenterology department I was on my<br>own for a while and the teaching and<br>gastro is is is a lot so we needed<br>another teacher but how to find another<br>senior lecturer with publications and<br>everything's like that so I talked to<br>Barry and very gladly agreed with me<br>that we need somebody who can actually<br>focus on teaching we do a lot of<br>research in gastroenterology already and<br>in the Department of Medicine and such<br>but we need somebody who is really<br>passionate about teaching so Steve came<br>along and said well you know I don't<br>really have much in terms of research to<br>show you I don't have many publications<br>but what I'm really passionate about is<br>teaching so Steve was appointed he also<br>then enrolled into a master's of medical<br>education and with with that combination<br>of being passionate in having a course<br>that gives him the theoretical knowledge<br>in teaching this was just a fantastic<br>combination and Steve has taken onboard<br>the teaching in the Department of<br>Medicine<br>once and it's not just well<br>horns from Texas it's really literally<br>taking it on by its horns and he's done<br>so many things that I didn't think a<br>part of teaching we now do a quiz show<br>we do almost something like a roving<br>reporter in the Barnett lecture theatre<br>and go around with the microphone and<br>our students to answer questions we<br>don't have students as some of my<br>predecessors you said that look in their<br>phone or look in their laptop or even<br>fall asleep with Steve in the room that<br>doesn't happen because they are all just<br>on the spot they have their cell phone<br>in their hands but to answer questions<br>to to bring questions up to the screen<br>it's been just absolutely fantastic and<br>I think what it was a little bit of a<br>dusty teaching that we had in in<br>gastroenterology is now for me as a head<br>of department of medicine and absolutely<br>shining example how teaching should be<br>done so thank you Steve for all your<br>enthusiasm and innovation so thank you<br>very much for attending the time is up<br>refreshments are in the foyer noir era</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
