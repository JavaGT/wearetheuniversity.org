Andrew received a NZ$1500 study grant, and airfares and accommodation to represent Otago at the Australasian Three Minute Thesis Competition at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, which was held on 11 October 2012.<br><br>Second place and a NZ$750 study grant went to Allamanda Faatoese from the Department of Medicine at the University of Otago’s Christchurch campus, whose topic was ‘Why are Māori dying earlier of heart disease?’<br><br>Hemakumar Devan from the School of Physiotherapy was awarded third place and a NZ$500 study grant for his presentation ‘Amputation, Asymmetry and Low Back Pain.’ Hemakumar also won the NZ$250 prize for best presenter as voted by Dunedin high school students who were invited to attend the final.<br><br>Our other finalists were:<br><br>- Tim Crawford – Departments of Biochemistry and Botany<br>- Rebecca Cooke – Departments of Human Nutrition and Medicine<br>- Rebecca Van Amber – Department of Applied Sciences<br>- Neil Vallelly – Department of English and Linguistics<br>- Wiebke Finkler – Department of Tourism<br><br>https://www.otago.ac.nz/3mt</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>tena koutou katoa and welcome to this<br>event this is the 2012 final of the<br>three minute thesis competition or 3mt<br>as we call it this is the fourth year<br>that we've run this event and I trust it<br>will be as informative and entertaining<br>as usual i'm rachel sprung can Smith the<br>acting director of Graduate research<br>services and we oversee this event a<br>special welcome to our local schools<br>they will be instrumental in determining<br>the school's prized that present that<br>they think is the best and because we<br>have our schools here just a little word<br>of background really on what it is that<br>these students are doing in terms of a<br>thesis when you embark on university<br>study you generally start off in a<br>three-year bachelor's degree some people<br>may opt to do an extra year and honors<br>year and following that could be a<br>two-year master's thesis which has one<br>year of coursework and one thesis year<br>where people undertake research on a<br>topic of interest now if you get through<br>all that you can then go on to a<br>doctorate or PhD so people can go there<br>from either and honors or a master's<br>degree the PhD is three years of<br>full-time study where students are<br>following a research that they're truly<br>passionate about we hoped and and then<br>they after that they come out with a<br>doctorate or a PhD when you do that you<br>get to wear a fancy gown like this one<br>so mine came from the University of<br>British Columbia in Vancouver this year<br>we've had many entrants across the<br>divisions and the University and today<br>we're going to hear from nine finalists<br>we had hopes there would be a tenth one<br>but unfortunately due to illness she had<br>to pull out a big thanks to OfficeMax<br>for their generous sponsorship and this<br>is the fourth year running their office<br>makes of sponsored us and towards the<br>end of the session today will be getting<br>the two representatives here they've<br>been at the key account men<br>Murdo ross the account manager to help<br>present prizes now to the rules of the<br>competition each presenter has three<br>minutes to speak and they're only<br>allowed one static slide the<br>presentation should be engaging and<br>perched at the level of an intelligently<br>person it should describe the research<br>but also communicate the enthusiasm and<br>the significance of the work and judging<br>this today we have our panel of judges<br>up here and I'd like to just introduce<br>them in turn first we have our chief<br>judge professor richard leakey richard<br>is our deputy vice-chancellor research<br>and enterprise so he has oversight of<br>research at Otago he's a graduate of<br>Otago he did an honest degree and<br>science and he went to Cambridge under<br>his doctorate there his research field<br>has applied electromagnetics his<br>principal interests of the development<br>of low-cost nano scale imaging using<br>near field light and other<br>sub-wavelength<br>optical phenomena for something lighter<br>and perhaps more easily understood it's<br>rumored that Richard as a master of the<br>Rubik's Cube so he can think fast which<br>is a necessary skill for a 3mt judge our<br>second judge is associate professor<br>she is in the Department of politics she<br>did a picture of arts honors degree at<br>Canterbury and a PhD at Victoria<br>University in Wellington she's an expert<br>in constitutional politics and the media<br>so maybe she understands sound bites and<br>we gather that with her net spoiling<br>prowess she's definitely up for a good<br>competition finally we have dr. Michael<br>Stedman Michael is our first-ever guest<br>judge from outside the university he has<br>an Otago University of Otago honorary<br>degree of the Doctor of Laws to<br>recognise his outstanding contribution<br>to film and media and New Zealand he's<br>managing director of the Natural History<br>New Zealand this is the largest producer<br>of wildlife films in the southern<br>hemisphere so we're very fortunate to<br>have him here today and he knows all<br>about the importance of communicating<br>science and research and a compelling<br>fashion what are the judges going to be<br>looking for well a few criteria that we<br>need to keep in mind you're going to<br>look for communication style was the<br>thesis topic and its significance<br>communicated and a language appropriate<br>to an intelligent but nonspecific<br>audience secondly comprehension did the<br>presentation help the audience<br>understand the research and thirdly<br>engagement did the presentation make the<br>audience want to know more now a few<br>other people to introduce firstly and<br>most importantly as actually Susan Craig<br>of timekeeping this is a very important<br>role she will start the timing when the<br>present when the presenter starts<br>speaking<br>and will hold up a sign indicating when<br>there are 30 seconds meant so take note<br>our presenters she will hold up another<br>sign when there are 10 seconds left<br>this is the reg sign and then she will<br>ring the bell at 3 minutes<br>presenters must stop talking as soon as<br>they hear the bell or they will be<br>disqualified at the end of the prism to<br>each presentation will be seeking<br>feedback from the judges<br>and will go and tune to get their views<br>and their most importantly what about<br>the prizes the third-place winner will<br>receive $500 the second-place 750 and<br>the supreme award winner will get a<br>$1,500 prize plus there's more a trip to<br>Brisbane to compete in the Australasian<br>final on October the 11th we also have a<br>school's prize a special 250 dollar<br>prize to the presenter that the school<br>pupils have thought was the best based<br>on their vote what is your role as the<br>audience it's to be very supportive and<br>vocal in your appreciation for these<br>finalists and very importantly we want<br>to hear from you but we don't want to<br>hear your cell phones so if you've got<br>cell phones please make sure that they<br>are switched off all right now we get<br>into the exciting part the presentations<br>as I said we've got nine finalists<br>presenting today we had hoped for a<br>tenth Ruth Cunningham from the<br>Department of Public Health and<br>Wellington was supposed to be here but<br>unfortunately due to illness couldn't<br>make it I will now call upon our first<br>presenter andrew filmer comes to us from<br>the department of music<br>he's an international student from<br>Malaysia who is on a prestigious New<br>Zealand international doctoral research<br>scholarship he transferred to Otago from<br>Victoria University so clearly he saw<br>the light<br>he started here in March the seer and<br>his supervisor as associate professor<br>Anthony Ricci good afternoon I asked<br>myself recently why I'm doing a PhD the<br>robes are fantastic of course and I love<br>this quest for knowledge I think what I<br>really really enjoy is finding out all<br>these things which I've taken for<br>granted in the field of music nothing<br>fits this description better than the<br>tuning of stringed instruments violins<br>and violas and cellos have a standard<br>tuning and where we rarely deviate from<br>this standard tuning it wasn't always<br>this way there's this wonderful lost art<br>of alternative crazy even you know just<br>the most unimaginable tunings you can<br>believe in the 17th century there was a<br>composer who decided that if he could<br>find the most harmonious tuning of his<br>strings he could create music that<br>inspired people to be more spiritual he<br>even tried to do this in a visual way if<br>you look at the left-hand side of the<br>graphic you'll see a violin that has<br>strings crossed in a metaphor for the<br>crucifixion of Jesus Christ two hundred<br>years later you had a composer who tried<br>to do something completely different he<br>tried to find the most dissonant<br>mischievous tuning in order to conjure<br>up the image of a devil fiddler who<br>comes to your house in the middle of the<br>night playing the violin and steals your<br>children<br>I tried to take this creative spark and<br>bring it to the 21st century I<br>experimented with tunings I bring it<br>into a lab I record samples and I<br>consult an expert in acoustics to find<br>out why things work this way how do we<br>get new colors of sound I also consult<br>makers of instruments including the<br>world's leading innovator instrument<br>design and you can see one of his<br>designs on the right hand side of the<br>slide what do I do with this I create<br>new additions and bring it to the<br>concert hall why is it significant if I<br>could put it in one word its creativity<br>I try to provide new channels of<br>creativity for composers and for<br>performance it's about understanding the<br>instruments to which they have dedicated<br>their lives and in doing so realize that<br>their new possibilities literally at<br>their fingertips it's also significant<br>because I've helped answer a<br>hundred-year-old question that deals<br>with one of Bach's<br>most famous pieces of music he used an<br>instrument which we do not have in<br>common usage today but with retuning a<br>common instrument today I've managed to<br>preserve the kind of sound the kind of<br>contrast that he wants it in this very<br>famous work but it has just a personal<br>significance for me as well at the end<br>of the day when I finish this and get<br>this lovely gown I'm gonna ask myself<br>what's the next thing to do and I know<br>what it is it's to question the things I<br>take for granted thank you very much<br>thank you Andrew and now we'll hear from<br>our judges and first up Richard<br>yo Andrew hey I was told that this was<br>like American Idol and I love that show<br>so I hope you're not Simon Cowell and<br>you know no no look I've got I've got<br>really Jackson's votes in for every year<br>and and boy you were the right thing to<br>start this show because with American<br>Idol I can say this one was a hot one a<br>bit pitchy here there but I really liked<br>it spiritual visual mischievous Jesus<br>and the devil<br>you had it all man so way to go thank<br>you so much Andrew ever watched American<br>Idol so I'm probably in the wrong place<br>no it really was a great start for the<br>competition I thought it was great that<br>you could be spontaneous and what you<br>were presenting with adding in a few<br>jokes very engaging and really seemed to<br>come in a way that people could relate<br>to and certainly making it very personal<br>I think he was trying to do a Simon I<br>really do<br>yeah he read that whole thing from his<br>iPhone so I'd be concerned about that I<br>thought he was just a wonderful natural<br>storyteller it was just fantastic and<br>you're engaged in a way that was very<br>very connected with the audience you<br>know I watched you you worked across the<br>entire audience you used humour you used<br>pace you were rose and fell that was<br>just wonderful so congratulations and I<br>wish I could do that you know it's just<br>terrific well done thank you<br>so clearly Andrew set a high bar for the<br>competition this afternoon our second<br>contestant is Tim Crawford he comes to<br>us from the department's of biochemistry<br>in botany<br>he started his PhD in May 2010<br>so he's been going two years and four<br>months his supervisors dr. Tina<br>Sommerfeld and associate professor<br>Albert Einstein once said that<br>everything is energy it is at the very<br>core of our collective civilization and<br>every year our thirst for it grows even<br>as the resources dwindle and the prices<br>skyrocket for it is a process so<br>efficient at capturing and storing the<br>limitless energy of the Sun that it has<br>changed very little in over two billion<br>years so I asked what if we could tap<br>into such a process what if we could<br>somehow capture that endless energy and<br>convert it into forms that we could use<br>for answers return to the evolutionary<br>pioneers of photosynthesis the<br>cyanobacteria when they first came into<br>existence almost three billion years ago<br>they inhabited a world unrecognizable to<br>us and devoid of oxygen but they<br>possessed the microscopic innovation<br>that would change all that photosystem<br>two is a unique powerful and intricate<br>molecular engine built of chlorophyll<br>and protein in place of steel and oil<br>powered by water and sunlight instead of<br>petrol and the oxygen that it releases<br>as exhaust is now vital to almost all<br>life but the sign of bacteria have kept<br>some genetic relics from before the<br>machines had failed our atmosphere with<br>oxygen my research has focused on a set<br>of genes that are switched on from time<br>to time to help them survive when they<br>encounter these stressful conditions<br>once again the key gene in this set is<br>an alternative form of the core<br>component in photosystem ii PSB a1<br>looking backwards in time this gene has<br>implications for the evolution of<br>photosynthesis but in today's aerobic<br>environment<br>we've found that PSB a1 is still<br>important for the synthesis of<br>chlorophyll and for regulating the<br>levels of photosystem ii more<br>importantly we think that these genes<br>are crucial for the function of another<br>enzyme the hydrogenase which when<br>coupled to the solar energy being<br>channeled into photosystem 2 could<br>provide the solution we've been looking<br>for this tiny protein acts as a safety<br>release valve taking some of the<br>damaging excess energy from<br>photosynthesis and turning it directly<br>and to hydrogen gas now hydrogen is one<br>of the best fuels we have it burns with<br>a clean flame and it has<br>time's energy per kilo of gasoline if we<br>could somehow understand and tap into<br>this process then hydrogen producing<br>cyanobacteria Granum bioreactors like<br>these could one day make our coal plants<br>and oil works obsolete cyanobacteria had<br>provided the energy for life on earth<br>for almost 3 billion years it is no<br>stretch of the imagination to envisage<br>them powering our cities vehicles and<br>industries and a sustainable and<br>completely natural fashion forever thank<br>you<br>okay some let's hear what the judges<br>have to say for that Janine you have<br>quite the support crew here - thank you<br>so much for that um you had a hard job<br>with all the technical jargon and so<br>forth and I actually felt that you<br>connected it well to issues that lay<br>people could understand so well done<br>with it and made it interesting and<br>engaging you did seem to have a slightly<br>shaky start but made a really good<br>recovery so well done thank you love of<br>the turnout fantastic ten out of ten for<br>you know putting real effort um good one<br>there the only thing I would say with a<br>couple of things I've got to say what<br>you are doing<br>I have often likened to standing naked<br>in the Octagon that's how tough it is so<br>well done but what I would say is to<br>relax a little more and to enjoy<br>yourself would have made the journey a<br>wee bit easy only didn't you did they do<br>that slight slip but you picked it up<br>and that was well done there's a great<br>recovery I would have just sort of<br>walked out I think that you know that<br>this was and the early part was aimed at<br>an intelligent person well I'm sub<br>intelligent and so I rank myself<br>somewhere about a 12 year old and that's<br>where you should be pitching and I felt<br>that the end of your presentation was<br>what I would have started with because<br>you can save the world from a pretty bad<br>sort of outcome with what you are doing<br>and so you sell that at the front and<br>then you talk about the hair so I would<br>have turned it on its head but I thought<br>hey dude you rock and remember I'm the<br>Randy Jackson so you got to pitch it for<br>the six-year-old as well so everything<br>is energy and you showed good energy on<br>the stage again through the good in the<br>bear I love that suit as well and you<br>know just sharp and smart and confident<br>and so well done mate our next presenter<br>is Rebecca cook she comes to us from the<br>Department of Human Nutrition she<br>started her PhD in October 2009 so she's<br>been going in for two years and 11<br>months her supervisors are dr. Rachel<br>Brown associate professor Rachel Taylor<br>and dr. Paula injuries and I had see<br>she's got quite the support crew and the<br>back of the theater I'd like to take you<br>on a short stroll down Great King Street<br>sixteen years ago the only takeaways<br>available in the area were fish and<br>chips now in a strip of less than 200<br>meters there are two fish and chip shops<br>McDonald's KFC Pizza Hut Domino's Pizza<br>house pizza and a Copeland's bakery not<br>only that there were two rental outlets<br>where you can pick up a DVD or game to<br>certain watch or play while you consume<br>your calorie Laden food and drinks but<br>wait there's more you can also pick up<br>some alcoholic beverages from the bottle<br>store or stop in and for a few cold ones<br>at the bar this is an example of the<br>obesogenic environment at work the<br>availability of high-energy palatable<br>inexpensive food combined with an<br>abundance of labor-saving and<br>entertainment devices designed to keep<br>us from moving too much<br>his meant we've essentially evolved from<br>a society of hunter-gatherers to a<br>society of drive-through picker-uppers<br>yes clear away the Big Mac wrappers and<br>discarded gym memberships and you will<br>find people that have surprisingly<br>managed to remain lean somehow resistant<br>to the obesogenic environment you know<br>who I'm talking about<br>that person who seems to just eat and<br>eat whatever they want and never seems<br>to gain an ounce well most of us<br>struggle with our weight and sometimes<br>feel like we only have to look at a<br>piece of cake to gain 2 kgs what magic<br>ingredient to the bodies of these<br>obesity and resistant individuals<br>contain is this something intrinsic that<br>they're doing or not doing that somehow<br>protects them and most importantly can<br>we use this to develop strategies to<br>help those who continually struggle with<br>their weight I've recruited groups of<br>obesity resistant and obesity<br>susceptible individuals and compete a<br>number of characteristics that may<br>impact on obesity risk<br>aside from genetics I've looked at the<br>usual suspects dietary intake physical<br>activity body composition and metabolic<br>rate but more uniquely I've also<br>measured the body's hormonal response to<br>a meal and even the sensitivity to fit<br>in food I've also developed<br>questionnaires to try and delve a little<br>deeper into what makes our beastie<br>resistant and Friends different do they<br>listen um do they spend less time<br>sitting doing nothing do they only eat<br>when they're hungry but it's not they're<br>interested in food and eating do their<br>coat better when you give them extra<br>dietary calories did the appearance<br>refrain from using the starving children<br>and Africa guilt trip to get them to eat<br>everything on their plate or they just<br>plain lucky I certainly don't have all<br>the answers yet but for those of you<br>that fall in the susceptible to obesity<br>camp watch the space for those of you<br>that appear resistant to obesity keep<br>doing what you're doing but please don't<br>complain about how hard it is for you to<br>gain weight when the rest of us can hear<br>Thank You Rebecca right and start with<br>Michael this time well done Rebecca<br>fantastic you know tough being out there<br>in front not easy the M what you have is<br>something that is so germane and so<br>important to every person in this room<br>in this city in this country and indeed<br>in the world and that this is we're<br>looking at the first generation ever<br>that will live a shorter life span than<br>their parents as a result of obesity I<br>got slightly lost because I wasn't short<br>times where your research was heading<br>and again a lot like your colleague<br>earlier I would have picked up the<br>headline and put it at the top because<br>what you are offering is a key to a<br>future that is about health longevity<br>and a quality of life that's so<br>important so III think you were<br>fantastic and again thank you wonderful<br>oh you've got um he's kind of Randy's<br>got his iPod there no do some points I<br>should I should say I'm going through<br>these let's Rana be the one on that<br>cause I can't touch Syme anymore but I<br>could probably shouldn't say that one<br>but great great Rebecca look I I like it<br>I like you you're um what you did at the<br>start to draw us into the talk you took<br>us on a journey through a visual that we<br>could all connect to and imagine<br>ourselves going past those those takeout<br>joints and it was a very good way to<br>start again it would have been good to<br>have some take homes to take home but<br>that's a reflection on where the<br>so keep up the good work really<br>impressed thank you very much thanks<br>Rebecca I want to check the RULES to see<br>if I can give you extra points for that<br>fantastic banner I've never seen a go<br>nutrition banner before I'm not sure<br>that I have a working I actually really<br>liked the structure of the way that you<br>did it with the leaden I did think at<br>one point perhaps could have been<br>slightly shorter but I thought that by<br>the time you got to your research<br>I was completely engaged and what you<br>were talking about and really wanted to<br>know where you were going with the<br>research and exactly well it was the<br>only other comment I was gonna make was<br>you you raised so many interesting<br>questions I'm dying to know some answers<br>even some guest answers on your part<br>would have been good for that<br>you know anticipation but thank you<br>excellent presentation<br>our next speaker is Hema Kumar Devan he<br>comes to us from the school of<br>physiotherapy he's an international<br>student from India he started his PhD<br>only in May this year so he's only four<br>months and so to give him to this<br>competition for Munson is quite an<br>achievement<br>his supervisors dr. Ellen Carmen and<br>good afternoon everyone let me start my<br>talk by telling you a story of three<br>different people in this life the one in<br>the extreme bottom right is Oscar<br>Pistorius he is called the fastest man<br>with no legs on the planet next to him<br>is Mark ingles many of you will be<br>familiar<br>he's a Kiwi of course he's the<br>first-ever double amputee to climb the<br>Mount Erised the lady next to him many<br>of you won't be familiar<br>she is sudha chandran she is one of the<br>most acclaimed volume dancers from India<br>so what is quite common of all the three<br>they all are quite famous and they all<br>look like quite active but that's only<br>half of the story<br>on the other side it is only in this<br>group of people with lower limb<br>amputation have the highest prevalence<br>of low back pain lower back pain is a<br>global problem in New Zealand every<br>second person with lower limb amputation<br>suffer from low back pain this<br>percentage is approximately twice that<br>reported in the general population such<br>a high prevalence made us to think why<br>is it so common and what are the factors<br>that could contribute to this high<br>prevalence it has been hypothesized<br>walking with an artificial limb could<br>predispose them to asymmetrical loading<br>of low back regions and that could<br>result in low back pain what is this<br>asymmetrical loading say for example a<br>person with right lower limb amputation<br>walking with an artificial limb could<br>walk or perform movements with some<br>degree of asymmetry like leaning more<br>towards this left leg perhaps it is how<br>they adapt to their artificial limb but<br>how much of adaptation is good and when<br>it becomes a problem it's what we don't<br>know and that's where my thesis comes in<br>whether asymmetrical loading of low back<br>region is this a potential mechanism for<br>low back pain to answer this question<br>our initial literature review revealed<br>that there is no study to investigate<br>the link between asymmetrical loading<br>and low back pain in this population so<br>we are flying to further investigate<br>this link by conducting focus group<br>interviews and a national survey this<br>will be followed by a biomechanics or<br>movement analysis study in a group of<br>low limb amputees with and without low<br>back pain so why is it so important<br>because our<br>we'll be the first to inform a new area<br>of research investigating the mechanics<br>of asymmetrical loading in this<br>population it will inform the clinicians<br>and researchers to better understand the<br>link between asymmetrical loading and<br>low back pain if we are able to find a<br>link from my thesis that will help us to<br>devise prevention strategies to prevent<br>asymmetrical loading in this population<br>although low back pain is not a<br>life-threatening problem like a cancer<br>but just imagine the process of<br>undergoing an amputation itself it's a<br>major life-changing event by preventing<br>the second disability following<br>amputation will definitely help them to<br>have a better quality of life come back<br>after two years I'll be here to show the<br>results of this link in 2014 3 minutes<br>final I hope to see you all there thank<br>you<br>fantastic let's see what I just have to<br>say about that loved every minute of it<br>dude you'd a bomb and certainly prize<br>for best pressure best job and the<br>presence of competitor cellphone<br>interruption but again really good good<br>style leading us in with stories people<br>we know people we don't know again even<br>with the technical language coming back<br>to what it means you're a fantastic job<br>for our youngest competitor thank you<br>very much thank you thank you you really<br>seem to be enjoying yourself and the<br>audience enjoyed it too really good<br>reference to your slides too I thought<br>to kind of keep people's attention with<br>that and engaging with what you've got<br>up there and really nice translation of<br>some of that technical language to give<br>people something else to understand it<br>by before you started using those words<br>so thank you that's Dan thanks Wow a<br>great energy unbelievable you reminded<br>me of one of those infomercials but wait<br>there's more I had to work really hard<br>to keep up because you you were going to<br>get you everything you couldn't have<br>that three minutes so you know sometimes<br>a little list can be more yeah so you<br>know there's a lot of information I was<br>really working the energy there was<br>terrific and just congratulations but I<br>really loved the beginning because you<br>framed it in a wonderful context and you<br>exactly where you were going and you<br>took me there albeit at high speed<br>so thank you our fifth presenter is<br>Rebecca van amber she comes to us from<br>the Department of Applied Sciences again<br>with a fanclub present here<br>Rebecca is an international student from<br>the United States<br>she started her PhD in October 2009 so I<br>was approaching three years her<br>supervisors are Professor Rachael Lange<br>associate professor Cheryl Wilson and<br>Bronwyn Lowe who here today is wearing<br>socks as I suspected it's nearly<br>everyone in the room we don't know how<br>many people worldwide wear socks but<br>it's estimated that roughly 4.5 billion<br>people wear shoes so we can assume that<br>a similar number of people wear socks as<br>these two garments are inextricably<br>linked<br>now the sock is a humble garment which<br>is critical to human comfort and health<br>as it provides a barrier between the<br>soft skin of the foot and the relatively<br>more rigid materials of the shoe this is<br>to prevent the formation of friction<br>blisters which can be not only painful<br>but they can impair locomotion and<br>provide an opening for infection now<br>many sock companies today are promoting<br>their products as having unique high<br>performance properties and/or features<br>and these claims can be confusing or<br>even misleading to the consumer so the<br>aim of my PhD is to determine which<br>common variables affect the properties<br>of socks for sport and outdoor<br>activities to do this I'm investigating<br>three common fiber types mid micron will<br>fine wool and acrylic three yarn types<br>single conventional twist and low twist<br>and three common fabric structures<br>single Jersey half Terry and Terry and<br>you can see those different structures<br>on the upper right hand corner of my<br>slide now my research is different from<br>previous studies in that I'm using<br>carefully controlled sock fabrics which<br>were made specifically for me<br>and this will allow me to directly<br>compare the variables that I'm<br>investigating now I know you're all<br>dying to know what sort of sock should I<br>buy and can a superior sock really be<br>developed well so far my research<br>indicates that the most important factor<br>on the thermal and moisture transfer<br>properties of sock fabrics is the fabric<br>structure yes the fiber does have an<br>effect but this effect is small and it<br>is likely masked by the much larger<br>effect of fabric structure you can see<br>this clearly in the two graphs of<br>thermal resistance and water vapor<br>permeability that are behind me on my<br>slide the fiber types are in blue the<br>yarn types are in red and the fabric<br>structures are in green clearly the<br>differences between the different<br>structures are much larger than the<br>differences among the fabric and the<br>yarn types or sorry excuse me<br>fiber and yarn types so what does this<br>mean for you as a consumer well it means<br>that a tarry sock is going to be warmer<br>and transmitted less water vapor than a<br>half tarry or a single Jersey sock so<br>you might want a tarry sock for cold and<br>dry conditions like skiing and you might<br>want that single Jersey sock for hot and<br>humid conditions maybe going on a hike<br>so to sum it up my research greatly<br>improves our understanding of sock<br>fabrics and we now have the knowledge<br>base required to develop sport and<br>Thank You Rebecca let's take it to the<br>judges Thank You Rebecca I have a son<br>who refuses to wear socks of any kind so<br>exactly I'm really interested to know<br>what's the best kind of socks so I can<br>at least try that out on them again the<br>fan clubs fantastic I was interested to<br>know where the sock thing was going and<br>now I do know I thought that your<br>presentation was very clear you have a<br>very clear voice to listen to and I<br>enjoyed listening thank you I found the<br>foot graphics sufficiently disgusting<br>that I really didn't pay much attention<br>to the graphs underneath you know that's<br>probably my fault and not yours but<br>overall I thought it was really a very<br>good clear presentation and you did a<br>really nice pitch of the value of your<br>research thank you you certainly did you<br>did you feel these people on their own<br>accord oh yeah what are the things at<br>the beginning you said that there was<br>something like I think was four billion<br>people with shoes is that right that's<br>what estimated estimated and most of<br>those always sucks well I'm not sure<br>about that because in Asia a lot of<br>people don't wear socks and that I found<br>that sort of an interesting premise it's<br>to start but that said I think what you<br>present it was terrific and I really<br>really look forward to the answer<br>because I go through every conceivable<br>type of suck for on the boat when I'm<br>tramping in the winter well I'm noting<br>the winter head method not hand at it I<br>get the best for Reno and it still<br>doesn't keep me so I really think that<br>what you have has a huge application to<br>everybody in this room and beyond I<br>thought in your presentation that was<br>good it was clear I understood it and<br>unlike some of the others because I'm a<br>simple person not six but twelve I<br>understood and comprehended everything<br>I've struggle with Randy on the Sun I'm<br>like wow so I think absolutely best soft<br>talk of the day in tights I didn't wear<br>my socks because I thought that might be<br>construed as a costume no really good I<br>like I like the way you presented and<br>start I got a little bit lost in this<br>it's one of these issues we've got a lot<br>of variables you got three by three<br>variables but you'd brought up you<br>started well I thought well what are we<br>talking about here lots of variables you<br>did bring it back very well at the end<br>in terms of clearly describing what the<br>main findings were so you know it's one<br>of these things when you when you give a<br>presentation you can lose people in the<br>middle sometimes but as long as you<br>bring them back at the end that can be<br>very good so well done<br>our sucks presenter is Neil Vallely he's<br>from the Department of English in<br>linguistics he's an international<br>student from Northern Ireland and he's<br>on a prestigious New Zealand<br>Commonwealth scholarship also a good<br>group of supporters here he started his<br>own PhD relatively recently as well and<br>March 2012 his supervisors are professor<br>evylyn Tribble and dr. Schiff Rodgers<br>Neil we flick a switch and our<br>surroundings are be at the light we go<br>out at night and our streets are lined<br>with lights we go to the theater and our<br>attention is directed by light for us<br>light is everywhere it is such a<br>fundamental narrator and the story of<br>our daily existence yet we are rarely<br>conscious of its defining beans we<br>depend so much on its ubiquity that we<br>dare not contemplate an existence<br>without it yes it hasn't always been<br>this way in fact far from it in the<br>pre-industrial worlds of 16th and 17th<br>century Europe life often had to be<br>contemplated without light imagine a<br>time before electric were like was just<br>a fling imagine going to a theater where<br>there is little contrast between the<br>lighting of the stage and the auditorium<br>these are just some of the conditions in<br>which the early modern individual<br>experienced light Elizabethan playwright<br>John Marston values candlelight so<br>highly that he personifies it as a poet<br>but not just any put a rare and skillful<br>poet when we consider the night time<br>that Marcin would have experienced we<br>can see why light would be worthy of<br>such high praise for Marcin and his<br>contemporaries light was a precious<br>material that offered an escape from the<br>acute anxiety of night my thesis argues<br>that the ways in which we<br>experience like are ways in which we<br>represent like in language characterize<br>ways in which we experience light in the<br>world since experiences of like differ<br>so vastly in the 16th and 17th century<br>then I call for re-examination of the<br>meanings of light on the early motor<br>stage we must ask what was light what<br>materials were used in artificial<br>lighting who had access to these<br>materials how when and where really used<br>in what ways the lighting differ between<br>outdoor and indoor theaters what was<br>daytime like what was nighttime like<br>it's through answering these questions<br>that we come to understand the<br>conditions which the early modern<br>individual conceptualized light so when<br>Byron's theater Shakespeare's Love's<br>Labour's Lost light seeking light doth<br>light of light beguile I argue that we<br>cannot simply interpret these<br>representations of light and release<br>into the world that we experience rather<br>their meanings are deeply embedded in<br>the conditions of the early modern world<br>is through investigating how the early<br>modern individual experienced these<br>conditions that we come to understand<br>she experienced light and the rare<br>freaking satirist that was Martha's poet<br>thank you<br>so than the light yeah the excellent<br>yeah you are a storyteller and you posed<br>questions and they're great questions<br>and I felt engaged I felt entertained I<br>wasn't quite sure where you take me but<br>I was willing to go to the rock and at<br>the end of the dark tunnel there was<br>light I really want the interpretation<br>of searching I'm not quite sure what<br>that is yeah I had to be careful that<br>that's okay well I was transfixed<br>transfixed mine but they're really<br>wonderful questions because in in<br>looking back we assume that it is like<br>it it was like it is and it isn't so I<br>think that's a wonderful journey and so<br>thank you for that and um a little bit<br>of Dylan Thomas and there I thought yeah<br>dude this man is in it to win it so for<br>a scholar of your discipline the<br>language was immaculate and it resonated<br>with me because of my background and<br>optics and light and the fact that you<br>wanted to connect the language to the to<br>the physical world that was was lived I<br>thought it was great you use some very<br>good techniques of repetition the word<br>light then in the middle imagine and<br>imagine and imagine this and in repeated<br>questions at the end you're very<br>talented thank you very much thank you<br>indeed thank you very much Neil I found<br>that enormous ly relaxing to listen to<br>in fact I was sitting here listening and<br>listening and I said thought written<br>anything down<br>certainly so then I furiously wrote lots<br>of things down it was a little blip when<br>you came to talk about what your PhD is<br>and I felt like saying no stop say that<br>again so I couldn't take it in and<br>listen cuz I that was really important<br>and I really wanted to make that<br>connection but I thought it was an<br>outstanding presentation beautifully<br>delivered thank you thank you<br>right got two speakers to go our next<br>speaker is allamanda farty OC she comes<br>to us from the Department of Medicine<br>and the University of Otago Christchurch<br>she started her PhD in January 2008 and<br>who supervises a professor Becky Cameron<br>and associate professor Richard<br>Troughton elamandha<br>now heart disease is one of the biggest<br>killers and is the cause of about forty<br>percent of all deaths and new zealand<br>but when we look at how heart disease<br>affects different ethnic groups across<br>New Zealand what we see is that Marty<br>have the highest rates of death from<br>heart disease compared to non Marty and<br>that we may die of heart disease they<br>die on average ten years younger than<br>nan Marty which leads me to the question<br>why are Marty dying earlier of heart<br>disease well in New Zealand we have the<br>National cardiovascular guidelines and<br>these guidelines and form doctors when<br>they should start screening for heart<br>disease risk factors but also how to<br>treat these risk factors in order to<br>improve heart health so my project was<br>to compare the levels of heart disease<br>risk factors between two very different<br>Marty communities the first were a rural<br>Maori community up and waddle and the<br>North Island and a second were at an<br>urban Maori community in Christchurch<br>City these were then compared to an on<br>Marty group and the non-motor group were<br>living in Christchurch City and they<br>were age and gender matched to our urban<br>Marty group so we recruited<br>approximately 250 participants within<br>each community group and they were all<br>randomly selected from the electoral<br>roll and aged between 20 to 64 years of<br>age now the finding government of my<br>thesis showed that even though eighty<br>percent<br>of all people within each of these three<br>communities had regularly visited their<br>doctors there were very different rates<br>of heart disease risk factors between<br>the communities and the key risk factors<br>are shown in that figured only on the<br>right hand side and in all cases as you<br>can see these respecters were much<br>higher and Marty than non-maori so why<br>are Marty dying earlier of heart disease<br>well again from our research it is clear<br>that Marty are going to their doctors<br>just as much as Don Marty but they are<br>not being adequately screened for heart<br>disease risk factors and that their<br>respecters are not being managed well so<br>in order so I ask again you know why are<br>Marty don't Ellie well you know we need<br>to have adequate screening for Marty<br>participants and so what can the health<br>system do in order to improve heart<br>health and Marty communities well<br>there's no need for new interventions<br>but simply that doctors screen more for<br>heart disease risk factors and they<br>effectively treat these heart disease<br>respecters in order to improve heart<br>health amongst all Maori communities<br>across New Zealand thank you<br>anyone to actually complete a PhD during<br>what's happen in Christchurch recently<br>that's a terrific achievement so let's<br>take it to our judges yeah hey I'm Dan<br>big ups for Christchurch oh that was<br>great<br>nice simple compelling question with<br>good information along and you've you've<br>done what is a really good thing for for<br>a talk<br>you've got me wanting to come up and<br>talk to you afterwards and ask you a<br>thousand questions and about what we can<br>do in and what leads on from that so<br>you've provided a good a good beginning<br>a middle and an end a little bit shaky<br>towards the end but you've got me<br>wanting to know more so that was great<br>thank you<br>thank you yes very clear beautifully<br>paced little shaky but maybe at the end<br>but I thought the difference perhaps and<br>style was that you kind of well I felt<br>drawn in to what you were talking about<br>rather than it being pitched at me so it<br>was quite a different style and I found<br>it really engaging so well done thank<br>you absolutely agree you have a<br>wonderfully easy style<br>you're a natural communicator you took<br>your time and you walked us through<br>something that was complex but I never<br>got lost you engaged so well with people<br>and as Richard said or we should we say<br>yo Richard I understood everything and<br>and you kept control and so it was just<br>wonderful so thank you for that thank<br>you<br>now we come to our last presenter for<br>the afternoon and at speaker finked what<br>she comes to us from the Department of<br>Tourism<br>she started her PhD in October last year<br>so she's been studying it for about 11<br>months her Otago supervisor is Professor<br>James home and she has a Spanish<br>supervisor as well who I will try to<br>pronounce that's Professor Ian Veneto<br>Leone vitka I remember going on my first<br>whale-watching trip 16 years ago dressed<br>up in a red survival suit travelling off<br>the coast of Vancouver Island in the<br>small zodiac no other boats around just<br>us the sight and the sound of the 14<br>meter grey whale surfacing beside a<br>small boat shortly after has stayed with<br>me since overwhelming experiencing such<br>charismatic giants four years later I'm<br>standing on a cliff top on nearby San<br>Juan Islands conducting field work for<br>my master's degree on whale watching in<br>the distance I noticed the flotilla of<br>boats approaching shortly after i'm<br>counting 25 killer whales and 120 boats<br>what was going on we had only just<br>brought whales back from the brink of<br>extinction and now it looked like we<br>were loving them to death instead in<br>2008 13 million people went while<br>watching in 119 countries generating 2.1<br>billion US dollars since the save the<br>whale movement of the 70s while watching<br>around the globe has developed into a<br>mass eco tourism industry widely<br>regarded as the antithesis to whaling<br>and equal to conservation my PhD will<br>challenge that perception marketing for<br>operators and non-governmental<br>organisations has played a key role in<br>the growth of whale watching in how it<br>is perceived by the public promoting<br>close encounters and attaching those to<br>conservation while this marketing wants<br>us to believe that while watching is a<br>benign<br>activity in reality that is not true a<br>significant body of research indicates<br>that while watching can endanger<br>populations of whales and dolphins<br>mainly due to proximity of boats and<br>associated underwater noise pollution<br>yet management and communication of<br>science have largely failed and there's<br>widespread public naivety about the<br>impacts of whale watching the solution<br>requires that the public's attitude<br>including whale watchers has to be<br>changed and that they become aware of<br>the need to keep their distance from the<br>whales we need to manage expectations my<br>PhD research is investigating a new<br>communication framework based on the<br>concept of a sy commercial it's a<br>commercial conveying science drawing on<br>elements of documentaries and TV<br>advertising I will produce and test sy<br>commercials and for the consumer to buy<br>into the concept that sustainable way of<br>watching has to be experienced from a<br>safe distance to the whales only an<br>informed public can make informed<br>choices and this sy commercial framework<br>is a new science advocacy management<br>tool for the whale watching industry<br>that can be used to bridge the gap<br>between scientists operators and the<br>public we have saved the whales once<br>before and potentially my research can<br>help to save them once again thank you<br>good use of the full three minutes there<br>all right let's go to the judges I was<br>gonna say old discount the words once<br>again since they came after the bell but<br>fantastic support crew again in fact<br>there's just been such great audience<br>participation and engagement in it it's<br>really fantastic to see I thought you<br>gave a really compelling and clear<br>communication of the problem that you're<br>addressing which is obviously a very<br>important one and one that I've often<br>wondered about myself so I'm really<br>personally interested in what it is<br>you're gonna find<br>I suspect the challenge for you when it<br>comes to trying to apply your research<br>will be how not to come across as the<br>party pooper but I hope that you do find<br>a way to do that really nice<br>certainly a very very important subject<br>tourism has held up as the great answer<br>to a great many things and it isn't it<br>has a very dark side to it I thought you<br>said with a wonderful story you engaged<br>the audience he painted a terrific<br>picture and it you I fell in love with<br>the whales and then you put them back<br>under threat now there's a very very<br>good device you gave people a great<br>context and which to understand your<br>research and your art from beginning to<br>end was a wonderful arc so it's a very<br>very well told three-minute story and<br>you know 10 out of 10 for hitting the<br>bell with only two words over and I<br>absolutely understood everything about<br>man the kids this time I think they want<br>it worse than ever<br>no really really great we've I again the<br>storytelling and the one of the things<br>about this competition is that you get<br>the opportunity to use visual cues but<br>you can only use one slide I think<br>everyone's done that very very well of<br>use of visuals and not using it as a<br>crutch because you used some modulation<br>and pitch you use your voice to signpost<br>the talk just as I was getting to the<br>end of your story and thinking well when<br>are you gonna tell me what the solution<br>is you say the solution will be and then<br>when I'm thinking and what are you gonna<br>produce you told me what you would<br>produce from your work and you<br>signposted that talk very very well<br>bringing me through from the beginning<br>again through a middle to an end thank<br>you very much<br>well I think you'll agree that's been a<br>fantastic set of presentations and we<br>can see why they are all finalists so<br>well done everyone<br>now we're going to have a break so that<br>the judges can deliberate so probably be<br>up to about ten minutes so I suggest you<br>stretch your legs and have a chat to<br>your neighbors and as soon as the judges<br>are back we'll get into the final<br>prize-giving phase okay we are now going<br>to hear the verdicts from the judges and<br>I will ask professor Richard Leakey our<br>chief judge to come up and say a few<br>words and then he's going to get our<br>office max staff here to come up and<br>thank you all Susan can you start the<br>clock<br>I should be time for three minutes for<br>this I need to say some general comments<br>on the afternoon impressions of the<br>judges I thought the judges did a very<br>good job I think their judge there's an<br>outstanding performance from all three<br>judges and I think you should give us<br>all a round of applause<br>likewise to Rachel Chris Andy and the<br>team who have put this together and<br>clear of course big round of applause<br>for them as well let me tell you this is<br>hard to do a PhD is a significant body<br>of work you have to make a significant<br>contribution to knowledge and you have<br>enough material even after four months<br>in a PhD to talk for many many hours so<br>distilling that down a simple message<br>that is deliverable to this kind of<br>audience in three minutes is a very<br>significant task and all of our<br>competitors today did very very well<br>they've gone through some preliminary<br>rounds they're well practiced and well<br>versed and the skills that you've<br>learned and doing this will serve you<br>well in whatever careers you have so I'm<br>really pleased to have been involved as<br>a judge this year and I have to say it<br>was a firkin hard job this item who'd<br>award the prize - and that must just<br>about me three minutes is it well thank<br>you to the sponsors as well without our<br>sponsors and of course to our school<br>student judges this would have been a<br>lesser event and OfficeMax who's here<br>from office mix that we can all give a<br>without you it would have been a lesser<br>event particularly from the competitors<br>point of view I will now invite the<br>school student representative to present<br>the school's prize which is a two<br>hundred and fifty dollar award and it is<br>Emily Gordon from Queens High School I<br>believe he's going to come down and<br>okay so the winner of the student prize<br>well done thank you very much<br>right and now I'll ask David Bennett the<br>key account manager from office next to<br>come up and printing the judges prize a<br>third place which is a five hundred<br>dollar study grant from office max goes<br>second place which is a $750 study grant<br>from OfficeMax goes to allamanda follow<br>say go Christchurch<br>and the supreme award winner which is a<br>$1500 study grant from OfficeMax plus<br>the expenses paid trip to attend the<br>third Australasian 3mt company<br>competition at the University of<br>Queensland that one sponsored by<br>Graduate research services is Andrew<br>filmer from music<br>thank you David so thank you all for<br>attending I think we've done it we've<br>had a very nice afternoon's<br>entertainment and I think it's served a<br>purpose very well I'd like you to thank<br>the organizers and the contestants again<br>and I just like all the other<br>contestants to come up we have a<br>certificate and a small gift of<br>appreciation for all of the other<br>contestants who performed extremely well<br>so thank you all if you just want to<br>come up here we'll get those presented<br>finally we do have a small gift for our<br>judges so they've done a tremendous job<br>I think they have providers for the<br>entertainment and some very constructive<br>feedback for the contestants as well it<br>was a really tough job to judge that lot<br>I think they were all terrific so big<br>I'd also like to invite our audience<br>back to some drinks and levels at the<br>postgraduate lounge the Gazebo lounge<br>and the and the center aisle sorry in<br>the Union in the ASB so please come up<br>to that all the audience unfortunately<br>we can't extend that welcome to our<br>school pupils but but those of age are<br>welcome to join us for not only for some<br>refreshments there but to further<br>discussions with our presenters because<br>I'm sure that sparked our interest in<br>the research and it'd be terrific to be<br>able to talk to our presenters and learn<br>a little bit more about their research<br>so I hope you'll join us there that'll<br>be at 4 o'clock finally we hope to see<br>you again next year this was a terrific<br>event we have heard about whales music<br>light heart disease it's been just<br>incredible so if you're disjoin with me<br>a final round of applause for our</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
