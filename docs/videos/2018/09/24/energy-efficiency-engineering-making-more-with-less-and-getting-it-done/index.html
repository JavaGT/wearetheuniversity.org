Lab-scale experiments may help to demonstrate overall effects and give confidence to try things on a larger scale, while numerical analysis may enable testing without the expense of a large-scale equipment. “While all of this work is great for academic publications and peer esteem, without passing through the R&D ‘pinch point’ to an installation in industry, no PJ’s of heat energy or kWh’s of electricity are actually saved,” says Professor Walmsley.<br><br>He says managing R&D projects above the ‘pinch’ is therefore important for delivering long-term benefits and research impacts to industry, and managing projects below the ‘pinch’ is important for staying on the landscape in a university setting and contributing to research excellence within the institution.<br><br>In his lecture, Professor Walmsley will discuss how the tension between scientific excellence and research impact is managed in engineering research, using dairy processing energy efficiency projects carried out by University of Waikato staff and students over 13 years.<br><br>Professor Michael Walmsley is currently the Assistant Dean of Academic programmes in the School of Engineering and is a founding member of the Waikato Energy Research Group. He was also part of a group that established engineering at the University of Waikato in 2000.<br><br>His academic career has led him to many universities around world. He has taught and/or done research at the University of Auckland, Monash University, University of Washington, University of Idaho, University of California Davis, University of Pannonia, Hungary and Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic. In 2014 he was a Fulbright Scholar, going to UC Davis to study renewably energy.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not

granddad during the talk but<br>really appreciate them being here<br>appreciate the support of my wife all<br>these years going to conferences and and<br>staying late at work and working on<br>papers and all that sort of stuff<br>appreciate all that she has done as well<br>in my talk today I'm going to be sharing<br>and some of the experiences that we've<br>had at the energy research group<br>collectively and I'll also be sharing<br>some of my thoughts along the way let me<br>just begin by laying out what I see is a<br>significant global engineering challenge<br>for the 21st century you know we live a<br>lot with the dependency on oil 85<br>percent of the world's energy supply<br>comes from oil and over our lifetime in<br>our children's lifetime another way of<br>powering the globe is going to be<br>required other than oil so energy<br>efficiency is going to be an important<br>part of the solution and when we look at<br>each country what happens in New Zealand<br>is going to play its role each country<br>has to contribute if a small country<br>says look I'm only small on less than 1%<br>don't worry about me if enough of people<br>do that then we're not going to get the<br>change happening now just for the sake<br>of simplicity most people don't know<br>what a Peter Joule is but you probably<br>know what a tanker of oil is so I've<br>translated some of the figures to<br>tankers of oil so New Zealand's energy<br>supply consists of about 450 tanker<br>loads of oil a year now that's not<br>strictly correct but approximately the<br>world<br>is living on about thirty three hundred<br>thousand tanker loads of oil and they<br>arrive at Marsden point regularly and<br>get unloaded and we we sort of live off<br>those now when a country wants to<br>improve its energy efficiency it makes<br>sense to focus on the big energy users<br>this is the world's largest dairy<br>factory located in Taranaki it uses<br>about two tanker loads of oil energy<br>equivalent per year now what's<br>interesting is when you compare that<br>with Hamilton you find that all the<br>homes in Hamilton will use about that<br>amount of energy<br>approximately okay<br>so where you make changes at one of the<br>large energy users it can have a big<br>effect now the politicians sign<br>documents that say we're going to meet<br>certain requirements they say that we're<br>going to improve our energy efficiency<br>but how is that going to happen the<br>engineers are going to play a key role<br>and the devil is in the detail of<br>exactly how that's going to happen now<br>let me just talk a moment about the yko<br>energy research group and some of the<br>important people that have helped to<br>make this possible let me acknowledge<br>professor peter camp who actually<br>started this in the 90s when his with<br>his research in the oil and gas geology<br>area in the early 2000s he helped us get<br>some work going in the energy efficient<br>industrial energy efficiency area with<br>James Neil and then later Peter Carey<br>later Martin Atkins and Lance Wong<br>helping to form our group we've also had<br>PhD students over the years these are<br>three of the ones that we have at the<br>moment we've had final year students<br>working on projects related to energy<br>efficiency we've had international<br>students mainly from Europe these are<br>3/4 of of 3 from Germany and one from<br>the UK and we've also formed<br>International collaboration with world<br>leading research groups in the process<br>integration area and collectively a lot<br>of what we've been able to learn has<br>been a team effort both locally and also<br>internationally through attending<br>conferences around the world and<br>presenting papers in the literature now<br>the research philosophy which we adopted<br>in the the energy research group was one<br>where we wanted to make a difference in<br>New Zealand industry we understood that<br>there's attention at times between<br>research and science excellence at a<br>university level and being able to make<br>a difference in an industrial setting<br>okay both of those things provide<br>attention and so one of the approaches<br>that we took was to have a strong<br>industry focus and James Neil was a key<br>part of that had a strong interest in<br>seeing things happen in industry and so<br>he helped to lead us and get us doing<br>stuff up here and not just sitting in<br>our comfortable locations of the office<br>and the lab and the computer room and<br>there we were able to get data fed back<br>to us so what we worked on was real<br>problems not just imaginary things that<br>academics like to dream up so practical<br>engineering solutions was something that<br>we endeavored to do we also set up<br>relationships with industrial producers<br>and suppliers and once again James<br>Neil's interest in the practical side<br>helped to lead that and overall we were<br>interested in influencing industry best<br>practice and ultimately changing what<br>was seen as standard practice so with<br>some of the partnerships clearly the<br>large energy users are ones that are<br>worth focusing on because some gains<br>there can have lots of benefits<br>understanding the government<br>organizations and we<br>the funding comes from was another key<br>part of what we've done<br>forming close partnerships with local<br>manufacturers and with the industrial<br>equipment suppliers was all important as<br>well<br>now when we think about engineering<br>research is an era there's a subject<br>area now as it is pinch analysis it's a<br>part of the research that we've done it<br>became clear that in order to get<br>something that's initiated at the<br>University all the way up to a<br>technology rollout in industry is not an<br>easy exercise industry rollout is sort<br>of a great goal but where we start is<br>way down here at the Fundamental<br>Research int and there's a long journey<br>from 0.1 to 0.6 some of the things that<br>you might do along the way is you might<br>do some lab scale experiments that mimic<br>what happens in the plant you might do<br>some numerical analysis on the computer<br>and digital and spreadsheet optimization<br>to give you an idea of what happens on a<br>larger scale in a plant but a lot of<br>these activities actually converge and<br>lead you to a pinch point and a lot of<br>university research and a lot of the<br>papers that you will read never really<br>get beyond that point right there a<br>critical step has to be undertaken and<br>that is you've got to convince industry<br>to do something in their plant in the<br>case of the process industry so they can<br>see firsthand that some benefits can<br>come if you can get a pilot plant<br>installation then there's a chance of<br>the full-scale if you can prove that<br>that can work then there's a chance for<br>technology rollout so that was something<br>that we saw very early on was needed in<br>order to have the lofty goal of making a<br>difference in New Zealand<br>industry now when you consider where<br>does the money come from to make these<br>things possible if we look at government<br>funding what you notice is most of the<br>funding actually gets channeled below<br>the pinch point at the University and<br>the fundamental end and there's some<br>funding channeling above the pinch to<br>help industry to encourage it to do R&amp;D<br>and where there is strategical strategic<br>initiatives there may be some funding<br>there when you look at industry a lot of<br>people will say industry doesn't fund<br>enough research what the problem is<br>there is sometimes we're looking in the<br>wrong place what we're looking at is<br>they're not funding enough research for<br>us down here but they can actually be<br>putting a lot of money into making<br>changes up there which are making a<br>difference and so both of those things<br>need to be taken into account when you<br>think about what is needed to make a<br>real difference so let me discuss the<br>New Zealand dairy industry that we've<br>been working in as a bit of a case study<br>I'm only going to focus on one<br>particular initiative that we worked on<br>is numerous others that my other<br>colleagues can talk about at length but<br>when we talk about the New Zealand dairy<br>industry it's one of the export<br>successes of New Zealand New Zealand as<br>an export country if we want plasma TVs<br>then we need to export things and buy<br>those things in so about fifty eight<br>point seven billion dollars with the<br>export earnings in 2017 dairy was 14<br>billion or about 26% of that now what a<br>lot of people don't realize is that we<br>actually turn ninety five percent of our<br>milk into exportable dairy products of<br>which a large amount of them about 75<br>percent is milk powder products now<br>clearly too<br>make milk powder requires a lot of<br>energy because you have to evaporate off<br>the water to make the powder so it's not<br>surprising when we look at the New<br>Zealand industries and we look at how<br>much energy they need for process heat<br>the food sector is one of the largest at<br>42.2 petajoules and dairy is a big chunk<br>of that process heat requirement now why<br>is so much process heat needed well<br>let's have a look at the milk powder<br>production process it's a simple<br>three-step process we start off with a<br>big supply of milk and initially there<br>will be some pasteurization we might<br>standardize the milk we may even<br>separate out the cream if we're going to<br>make skim milk powder but there's that<br>initial process step after that we send<br>the milk to a set of evaporators where<br>we concentrate the milk up to over fifty<br>percent solids and then we feed into the<br>spray dryers a large amount of steam is<br>required to heat up the air to then<br>drive off most of the water to where we<br>end up with a product that's essentially<br>dry at 96% silence so this process has<br>been around for quite a few years so how<br>can we improve the energy efficiency of<br>something that's been around for so long<br>it's not an easy task human nature has<br>it that we will often improve over time<br>so we're arriving late on the scene how<br>are we going to improve it so here is an<br>interesting diagram the exact numbers<br>have been removed but it tells a story<br>this the height of these bars represent<br>the energy per ton of milk powder to<br>produce the specific energy at a range<br>of factories built in New Zealand over a<br>number of years a high figure means<br>we're using a lot of energy a low<br>figure means it's more energy-efficient<br>so what you notice is there's been an<br>improvement over the years and now we've<br>sort of plateaued off have we plateaued<br>off because that's the best we can do or<br>is there some other opportunities that<br>still need to be determined so one of<br>the tasks that we needed to determine<br>was is there room for improvement we<br>believe that it was so we set a goal of<br>a 30% improvement to milk powder<br>production in New Zealand and began to<br>look at the research pyramid the<br>engineering research pyramid I've called<br>it and we said what are all the projects<br>that we need to do to feed in at the<br>bottom of the pyramid in order to reach<br>our goal of 30% improvement now not all<br>of these projects are going to<br>necessarily bear fruit but they may well<br>help us on the journey now from an<br>academic research point of view you know<br>we look to some of the thermodynamic<br>theory to find out what were the limits<br>of heat exchange that was possible to<br>share exhaust heat with some of the<br>streams that needed to be heated so<br>theory says yes we can do it but when we<br>talk to industry questions have doubt<br>raised is it really possible will it be<br>economic so this is sort of where sort<br>of theory has to hit with reality so the<br>work that we did needed to address<br>applying a theory but also the practical<br>reality of being economic and that's<br>what engineering research aims to do to<br>create things that ultimately can lead<br>to products and systems that are<br>economic the other thing that we were<br>aware of is that industry has practices<br>that they're used to doing and we're<br>going to have to influence that and<br>change industry practice so how do we<br>dearest things so they more willing to<br>make a change how do we get the<br>economics to work if I ask one of the<br>international suppliers to give me a<br>quote he almost says to himself I wonder<br>how much we can charge that's what a<br>free market is like right you charge as<br>much as you can get away with so how do<br>you get the guys to sharpen the pencil<br>the engineers from the international<br>suppliers to sharpen the pencil and say<br>hey we've dearest's the project so as we<br>can get the economics to work and what<br>is the implementation pathway that's<br>going to make this possible the other<br>thing that we had to think about was<br>what are the plant complications if<br>we're going to provide a solution for<br>the world's largest dairy factory what<br>things do we not know that we should<br>know that we need to take into account<br>well the first thing was realizing that<br>milk production in New Zealand is not<br>constant the cows give off milk to<br>supply to the calves and there's a peak<br>October and November there's a large<br>amount of milk that has to be treated<br>and then at other times in the year is a<br>lot less so what does that mean for the<br>plants well a lot of the plants have<br>multiple factories or multiple processes<br>they're not running all the time so<br>anything that you dream up of a scheme<br>to save energy when you do the cost<br>analysis you have to be aware of how<br>often the plants running which ones are<br>running and how does that affect the<br>scheme that you're dreaming up the other<br>thing that happens you're making a food<br>product it has to be cleaned regularly<br>the plants are not always running<br>they're having to be shut for cleaning<br>purposes for changing to a different<br>product so they are semi continuous<br>operating plants that adds a level of<br>complication there's a need for any<br>storage in any solution that you might<br>be coming up with the other thing you<br>have to be aware of is fouling and<br>hygiene issues the slide that you can<br>see on your right is a photograph that<br>we took at six o'clock in the morning at<br>the Tarawih dairy factory why was a<br>group of academics at the factory at six<br>o'clock in the morning well that was<br>when they clean the dryer that was one<br>of the doors or the hatches to one of<br>the large spray dryers and this is what<br>happens to it over a number of hours 12<br>16 24 hours it's dirty has to be cleaned<br>the operators that were there was<br>surprised to see us in the morning who<br>are you guys what are you doing here<br>we're from white Kelley University<br>really<br>we've never seen guys from white cat<br>from any University at six o'clock in<br>the morning well you know James can tell<br>a lot more stories I think he's been<br>there all night some of the time but one<br>way to build respect is to be there<br>early in the morning with the operators<br>and seeing them have to keep the plants<br>running and deal with their problems not<br>the usual thing for most academics the<br>other thing that you learn when you're<br>there is that operators have their own<br>culture and if you don't learn the<br>culture of the company when you come<br>along with your bright idea then these<br>guys will say you're a dreamer it won't<br>work did you think of this did you think<br>of that<br>okay so changing the culture is also a<br>very important part of the process so<br>having training of operators plays a<br>role and the energy research group has<br>been involved in some of that activity<br>so what areas of research do we need to<br>focus on in order to come up with a way<br>to improve the energy efficiency of one<br>of these large plants well here's sort<br>of four project areas that we can have<br>I'm gonna focus down here on<br>three and four milk powder fouling and a<br>heat exchange a design that is able to<br>recover heat from the exhaust of the<br>dryer and do some preheating with the<br>inlets so let's have a more detailed<br>look at a milk spray dryer and how heat<br>recovery can be achieved so here's a<br>schematic of a spray dryer operation as<br>you can see in the bottom left hand<br>corner we have outside air coming in at<br>15 degrees it's heated by steam to over<br>200 degrees mixed with milk concentrate<br>at the top of the dryer and evaporation<br>occurs milk powder is formed and comes<br>out the bottom and we end up with hot<br>warm air exhausting there now it's<br>pretty simple take heat from the exhaust<br>and exchange it down there well problem<br>solved well many years ago twelve<br>probably ten to twelve years ago we<br>looked at this since there's all that<br>simple but then people start telling you<br>of all the problems remember the Devils<br>in the detail so what's wrong with doing<br>this you know what are the issues that<br>have to be overcome in order to create<br>an economic heat recovery system that's<br>not going to fail that's not going to<br>just block and stop operating after six<br>hours then we have to turn the plant<br>down and clean it out so what are the<br>barriers to implementation do the<br>barriers give us an idea of what<br>research needs to be done<br>so clearly milk powder fouling was of<br>concern there was the risk of blockage<br>if we were to put some heat exchangers<br>in the exhaust the last thing the<br>company wants as unplanned shuts<br>millions of dollars can be lost quite<br>quickly it's not standard practice in<br>New Zealand so you know how do we<br>make the change they might be resistance<br>to change a number of years ago 2009<br>James was down James Neal was visiting a<br>plant in the South Island it was a new<br>plant being built there was actually an<br>exhaust heat exchanger that was going to<br>be put into the dryer the factory got<br>nervous and changed its mind and didn't<br>put the heat exchanger in and I don't<br>know if it still sits there in the<br>outside but it was there for a number of<br>years but the project did not go ahead<br>because of the fears of blockage so that<br>was another important area the other one<br>that we found was significant was<br>questionable economics was the rate of<br>return good enough for this to go ahead<br>so with those barriers being understood<br>we were able to start thinking about<br>what's the university based research<br>that is needed to help overcome some of<br>those barriers and if we go back to our<br>research engineering research pyramid we<br>sort of said what projects do we need to<br>put in there and there and there<br>to enable this to happen so let me show<br>you some of the projects that we<br>initiated we had master's students we<br>had a PhD student we had fourth-year<br>students work on this this here is a<br>piece of equipment that we set up in the<br>lab we could heat up air we could inject<br>milk powder the milk powder would be<br>affected by the hot air and we've chewed<br>it at a plate and we would look at what<br>were the properties of the air and the<br>milk powder that caused sticking or<br>fouling on stainless steel surfaces like<br>true academics we got excited about the<br>data we curve fitted we developed all<br>sorts of fancy models we wrote papers we<br>got accolades for good work industry<br>never read the paper but we felt good so<br>we went to the next stage and we<br>a small lab scale fouling Taric simply<br>heading milk powder against the plate<br>was sort of too idealistic why don't we<br>see what happens when the milk powder<br>comes in contact with tubes so this is<br>what's happening here the milk powder is<br>put in that little port hot air comes<br>here moves along and there's some tubes<br>about this location we can feed water<br>into the tubes to change the temperature<br>and here's some of the results okay so<br>on the front and on the back we could<br>measure how much milk powder was<br>sticking we could play around with<br>thicken what conditions doesn't cause<br>sticking what temperature what air flow<br>rate and so on we also looked at finned<br>heat exchangers and looked at when do we<br>get milk powder sticking to the fins and<br>all of this information was put into a<br>spreadsheet optimization model so we<br>could then design and make<br>recommendations to an optimal fin tube<br>heat exchanger which was then made by<br>the local supplier windsor so what we've<br>just done is we've worked our way up the<br>pyramid to this point and now we're at<br>the critical pinch point how do we<br>convince industry to do this to put in a<br>pilot plant now fortunately we applied<br>for funding before EMB changed the way<br>that they run the portfolio's and we<br>successfully wrote a bid that gave us<br>some money<br>with some help from industry to put in a<br>pilot installation okay so a pilot<br>installation was put in the trap a dairy<br>factory on the roof of that main<br>building that you see when you drive<br>past it on the motorway or on State<br>Highway one a few months or probably a<br>year before we did this a couple of us<br>climbed up to the top of the roof when<br>we happen to see this up there on the<br>roof this is the exhaust from one of the<br>dryers it's quite a big exhaust and this<br>hatch if you open it up you can look<br>inside there and you've got air flowing<br>hot air flowing out so the idea was why<br>don't we attach to that hatch and we can<br>put a rig that we can test to see if we<br>get blockage how much milk powder is<br>going to be caught in the in the heat<br>exchanger and we could also monitor the<br>performance of our heat exchanger so<br>this rig was what was designed this is<br>the heat exchanger that we're going to<br>test this is another heat exchanger that<br>we connect with that that is doing the<br>heating up that's doing the cooling as<br>part of a water loop this was the day<br>that the rig was lifted up 50 meters to<br>the top the roof of the of the at the<br>factory July 2015 this is the rig<br>installed here's the various parts as I<br>said there's the exhaust so the hot air<br>is coming down there and out there's the<br>heat exchanger that we're testing and<br>thus the heat sink heat exchanger and we<br>had a water loop so water is pumping<br>around so we can measure the performance<br>of the heat exchanger now let me just<br>show you some interesting results the<br>green represents the change in the<br>pressure of the air going through the<br>heat exchanger after 42 days they've<br>been minimal change the blue represents<br>the performance of the heat exchanger<br>after 42 days once again minimal change<br>so there hadn't been any effect at all<br>basically we were able to confirm what<br>we had worked out in the lab that if we<br>operate it under certain conditions we<br>will get no fouling industry was a lot<br>more convinced now that we had actually<br>put it in their factory with their milk<br>now we had all that we needed to produce<br>an informed business case we'd already<br>worked out quite some time ago that this<br>approach of extracting the heat from the<br>exhaust of the dryer and recovering it<br>and reusing it to heat the incoming air<br>or any other incoming stream could give<br>us between 10 or 15 percent energy<br>efficiency improvement and if you think<br>back to our 30% goal then it had the<br>potential to be 35 to 50 percent of our<br>goal potentially different factories<br>have different slightly different<br>potential we showed that you could come<br>up with a system that doesn't have<br>fouling we also showed that because of<br>the de-risking you don't need to<br>oversize everything just in case and<br>make it so expensive that it no longer<br>has a good enough rate of return we can<br>put a bit of pressure on the suppliers<br>to make sure that the business case can<br>work so essentially we're taking heat<br>from there and feeding it down there<br>so just to recap we've successfully made<br>our way up the pyramid through the pilot<br>stage and now the group those that are<br>full-time in the group are working<br>closely with industry for a full-scale<br>implementation and we're pretty<br>confident that this will become an<br>industry standard as the industry has<br>signed up to reduce its emissions and<br>hence its energy usage significantly by<br>2030 the other thing that we've learned<br>is that there's some differences between<br>academics sitting in their office and<br>Industry people especially in processing<br>plants this is a little bit of a<br>humorous list but a lot of academics<br>love to be the first and get lots of<br>citations if industry<br>is the first they likes to keep it a<br>secret or in other cases they don't want<br>to be the first because it's too risky<br>which is interesting<br>another thing we love proposing new<br>theories they want you to keep it simple<br>especially if you're training operators<br>who ultimately you have to implement<br>what you're doing we like to come up<br>with new methods that quite satisfied<br>staying with what's tried and trued we<br>love theoretical and simplified studies<br>we like to make sure it's a confined<br>problem they want us to do real plant<br>studies with all of the complication so<br>that way what we suggest actually is<br>real academics in their office are<br>always optimistic with costs industry<br>people often are very pessimistic with<br>costs they know what the cost of the<br>change will be in any costing it's what<br>you leave out that's the biggest source<br>of error and once again you know in your<br>office you don't know what you don't<br>know and that's the biggest source of<br>error the other thing here is we're<br>often not aware of the worst case and<br>the problems that arise periodically<br>that we don't take into account we often<br>less time and money sensitive to us yes<br>we'd love to do the project here we'll<br>give it to the student they can work on<br>it for the next couple of years<br>meanwhile industry wants it solved next<br>week because it's costing them and<br>lastly publish publish publish<br>production production production so how<br>do you work with industry when we have<br>these different needs these different<br>drivers well one of the things that we<br>have found is you've got to build trust<br>a trust between the research group and<br>the industry partner is key and having<br>people in the research group that are<br>willing to spend time with the industry<br>partners is a really key part<br>and lastly there are many engineering<br>challenges that benefit from university<br>industry partnerships but they do<br>require Vice Chancellors and university<br>leaders to understand the difference<br>between scientific research and<br>engineering research which is not just<br>interested in fundamentals but is<br>interested in forcing its way through<br>the pinch point and making a real<br>difference in industry thank you very<br>much for
