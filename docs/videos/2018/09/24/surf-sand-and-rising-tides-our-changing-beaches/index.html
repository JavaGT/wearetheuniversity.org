Breaking waves rapidly reduce wave energy, channelling it into hazardous rip currents and surf beat, and killing more people in New Zealand than any other natural hazard. Despite the random and unpredictable nature of surf, some intriguingly simple patterns emerge, if we view the beach through the lens of time-lapse imagery. Rip currents and sand bars often order themselves into neat arrangements which take substantial storm events to reconfigure. Headlands, which are common on our volcanically controlled land, play a special role, channelling currents seaward and trapping sand. Such variations make it difficult to assess coastal hazard zones, plan beach safety and prepare for sea level-rise, particularly when our wave climate is driven by long-period climate variations. Whether it be to protect the land where we live, or to enjoy the amenity of a good surf-break, New Zealanders are world leaders in their passion and interest in surf.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

by<br>acknowledging tiny wee who on the land<br>that we are here standing here today and<br>I'd like to start my talk by showing you<br>these videos video clip and with this<br>video clip I want to tell you about why<br>I find it interesting and exciting so<br>when you're a physical oceanographer you<br>study waves and currents and the problem<br>was studying waves and currents is you<br>can't see them with the naked eye you<br>have to think about them and imagine and<br>visualize them in your head but<br>basically as the currents move around<br>sandbanks and shape and form them we<br>can't see it so when I was doing my PhD<br>in the 90s satellites had just come into<br>action the first satellites went up in<br>the mid 80s and with those satellites it<br>was absolutely mind-blowing changing by<br>the way we thought about our own science<br>because everybody was trying to figure<br>out how we could extract information<br>from satellites to take the parameters<br>that we understood about our science and<br>if you're a waves person the particular<br>thing that you get from remote sensing<br>and imagery is the breaking wave<br>patterns they tell us where the waves<br>are now this video clip that I've been<br>showing you is from Tyrone Beach in the<br>Coromandel Peninsula and it's from the<br>Waikato Regional Council monitoring<br>station there and it shows it's been<br>going there for 20 years and what you<br>can see is sometimes the surf zone is<br>really really big during storms and<br>sometimes it's small you can see really<br>complex patterns evolve and sometimes<br>you see the beach becomes really simple<br>they're really really big rip currents<br>sometimes and then sometimes really<br>small ones<br>the beach sometimes has these bumps in<br>it and sometimes it goes flat so<br>basically what these averaged images<br>I've just shown you allow us to do is to<br>take a very complex wave breaking<br>environment and when we average it we<br>see these simple patterns evolve now if<br>we start looking at<br>video imagery and now satellite imagery<br>from around the world we see these<br>intriguingly regular patterns all around<br>the world for an example here these<br>welded bars in Cape Cod that's a house<br>there for scale so that's about a<br>kilometer here on a very small scale we<br>see these Beach cusps on hot water beach<br>the wood are so clear there that we can<br>see these Crescenta bars that are about<br>250 meters long here on the accutane<br>Coast in France we see extremely regular<br>rip current patterns and then if we go<br>up in scale we can see these flying<br>capes in the sea of asthma's they're<br>about 50 kilometres along so to figure<br>out how a complex environment with waves<br>breaking everywhere can make some simple<br>patterns we need to know a little bit<br>about how waved waves transfer energy in<br>the surf zone so we look at the beach<br>the waves come in from off shore and<br>then here they begin to feel the seabed<br>and they begin to break and as they<br>break the wave energy basically depends<br>only on the local water depth there so<br>if you're standing here the wave energy<br>only depends on the depth here and not<br>on how big the waves are offshore so<br>during storm events all that happens is<br>the waves start to break further<br>offshore and down here in the shoreline<br>the waves are quite a similar size<br>that's pretty odd so where does all that<br>energy from breaking go well I like to<br>think of energy as buckets of waves<br>buckets of energy there so the size of<br>the bucket is equal to the size of the<br>way for the wavelength or wave period<br>and the amount of water in the bucket is<br>the energy of the wave which is measured<br>as its size so we can put current meters<br>and pressure sensors out on the beach<br>and measure the relationship between<br>energy and size what we call an energy<br>spectrum and there's an example here<br>plotted here this is size on this axis<br>with the small buckets down here and<br>then the larger buckets here and here's<br>the wave height or<br>energy if you look at this red line here<br>pictured here we can see the small<br>buckets have little bits of energy and<br>this one has a large amount of energy<br>but if we go down here this bucket the<br>very largest scale is still empty as we<br>move towards the shoreline to this blue<br>line here we can see all of a sudden<br>this biggest bucket has filled up and is<br>now full of water or energy now this is<br>from tyro Beach on the East Coast but if<br>we go to the west coast the situation is<br>even more dramatic this incident peak<br>here that we can see the normal ways<br>that we can see has completely<br>disappeared and this big bucket has<br>taken all the energy all the energy that<br>is available out of those waves and put<br>it in here so if you're unconvinced by<br>the graph this picture this video clip<br>has been prepared by my former graduate<br>student PhD student Raphael Pettis and<br>he digitized the shoreline at Tyrone<br>Beach each of these yellow dots as the<br>shoreline and at Raglan or narrow nui<br>beach which is Ragland beach and you can<br>see the little dots go up and down with<br>every single wave coming in in tyro<br>beach whereas on the west coast Beach<br>the water line doesn't change very much<br>it only changes on a really slow cycle<br>so what happens gradually through time<br>this lo big bucket of energy gathers up<br>on the beach and begins to spill seaward<br>and start to scour out little holes<br>those little holes gradually continue to<br>grow and make big rip current channels<br>and it's those rip current channels that<br>you can see so well from the video<br>imagery when it's averaged there's an<br>example of Tyria Beach again that I was<br>showing you at the beginning now then we<br>can develop computer algorithms that go<br>and extract the channels and also the<br>sandbars like here and clean them up and<br>gradually track what happens to these<br>rip current channels through time and<br>here's an example each one of these<br>dots is a rip current channel obviously<br>these are the areas where we the waves<br>weren't breaking so we couldn't get<br>information and this is through the<br>summer of 2000<br>this is days on this axis and this is<br>long short distance on this excess so in<br>the beginning here we had three big rip<br>currents on one side of beach in the<br>summer and then the big winter storms<br>came by and changed the beach<br>reconfigured it moved it around and at<br>the end of the summer the beach had<br>rotated the sand had moved to the other<br>end and those big rip kurt channels had<br>gone completely to the other side well<br>repeat the same experiment two years<br>later in 2002 and the same thing didn't<br>happen the three rip current channels<br>went away completely and were turned<br>into eleven or twelve small rip current<br>channels well that sort of gives you the<br>indication that the beach isn't very<br>predictable and we can't make any sense<br>of it at all but that's not true we've<br>now analyzed many many many years of<br>this data and we can see that at least<br>some of the patterns are related to<br>rotation down here we've got the a long<br>shore scale and the cross your scale<br>plotted here and you can see that the<br>bigger the along shore scale the bigger<br>the cross Shore scale but over here<br>we've got the amount that the beach is<br>rotated and you can see quite easily<br>here that when the beach is in a<br>strongly rotated state we get those<br>really big scale currents up here well<br>what does this got to do with everyday<br>New Zealanders well I have to say I<br>admit I am NOT solving cancer I'm not<br>coming up with the cure to cancer here<br>but having said that New Zealanders have<br>put an immense amount of money into<br>property in fact the amount of money<br>that we have in coastal property is up<br>in the billions of dollars in New<br>Zealand and much of those assets are<br>below the 5 metre line all right and a<br>lot of those places and many of our<br>beaches are having severe erosion<br>problems through time and the erosion of<br>problems appear to be getting worse if<br>we look at this schematic<br>the Waikato Regional Council website we<br>can see on this axis all the Care Amanda<br>Beach has plotted and these lines<br>represent the distribution of houses in<br>the coastal zone in the Coromandel and<br>this is 0 to 50 meters a hundred meters<br>and so within this 50 meter line they're<br>an awful lot of properties that are<br>close to the ocean well when we<br>superimpose that on my shoreline<br>database from Tyra which is in the<br>middle here somewhere we can see and I<br>haven't picked a particularly dramatic<br>shoreline change this is a pretty<br>typical rotation for Tyra we could see<br>at the end of the beaches the shore<br>rotor can move up to 40 meters so if<br>you're one of the properties at the end<br>of the beach you're way too close to the<br>shore interestingly we tend to profile<br>beaches and monitor beaches right in the<br>middle which is exactly the worst spot<br>to monitor some of these beaches because<br>it's the place that changes the least in<br>New Zealand and on our coromandel<br>beaches at least well that was the slow<br>onset hazard associated with coastal<br>erosion and it kind of creeps up on you<br>as storms compound through time but we<br>also with rotation comes those really<br>big scale rip currents and those ripped<br>currents they're a much more immediate<br>hazard in fact they can even be<br>life-threatening<br>now you can't study the speed of<br>currents from a video camera or at least<br>not easily and so in order to do that we<br>have to deploy things like these<br>drifters these are neutrally buoyant PVC<br>plumbing pipes that have been filled<br>with insulation foam and so they float<br>just beneath the surface and sticking up<br>out of them is another PVC pipe and on<br>top of it is a GPS and so that GPS<br>contract these drifters through the surf<br>zone of course health and safety first<br>we had to accost guards help to pick<br>these up because they tend to get swept<br>out to sea so that's our Coast Guard are<br>also our technician beams and well who<br>happens to also volunteer for the Coast<br>Guard<br>very handy okay so this is our<br>experiment at Nera nui beach which is<br>Ragland beach at the south end of nari<br>nui beach is a very big rip current<br>system which tends to persist through<br>time in the same place now interestingly<br>enough just very very minor changes in<br>the wave patterns can make a very big<br>change to the rip currents these dots<br>here are where we deployed our drifters<br>and on the first day every single one of<br>them except for this guy here got shot<br>out to the open ocean and we had to go<br>and pick them up on the second day the<br>wave height changed by only 10 to 15<br>centimeters so tiny little bit of a<br>difference and that activated the<br>braking on this outer bar here see that<br>and that braking force Tolar drifters to<br>come back into Shore right so only one<br>escaped so the escape strategy that you<br>might have or the hazard that this rip<br>current poses is completely different<br>depending on these little braking<br>patterns well if we scale back if we<br>move zoom out with that camera we can<br>see our little rip currents there or a<br>big rip current down there but this is<br>what else that video camera shows it<br>shows the whole Delta system offshore of<br>the raglan harbor entrance and that<br>Delta system is the one that boats often<br>overturn on it's quite hazardous if we<br>plot gee Oh rectifier images or get a<br>bird's-eye view of our images we can<br>then plot our breaking wave pattern on<br>the Whitehead original council<br>multi-beam data which we collected for<br>them a number of years ago and you can<br>see that those breaking patterns really<br>line up nicely with where the sandbars<br>are which is very encouraging<br>interesting this little area here down<br>here is very important for surfers the<br>surfers love this wing of the ebb tidal<br>Delta our PhD student Sean Harrison<br>digitized the location of this AB tidal<br>Delta through time and these are the<br>results of his efforts and you can see<br>these blue<br>life or where the F title Delta is in<br>late that's December January and<br>February these red lines are where it is<br>in November October September and so you<br>can see that it moves in and out where<br>flaps its wings like a bird very<br>interesting<br>along the side here as it flaps its<br>wings the surfing conditions can change<br>completely along that side so you have<br>seasonal changes in the surfing<br>conditions well I never really thought<br>about surf that much<br>and in fact surf has become much more<br>important in my life than I ever<br>expected New Zealand's one of the only<br>places in the world where we protect<br>surf breaks and that their surf breaks I<br>think 17 of them are listed as<br>nationally significant breaks in the New<br>Zealand coastal policy statement well we<br>really are passionate about that to the<br>point where we can protect them now what<br>are we protecting about a surf break<br>we're protecting here is what's called<br>the peel angle which is the speed at<br>which the white water moves down the<br>crest and how long it takes for that<br>white water to move down the crust for<br>the length of the ride<br>interestingly those are exactly the<br>parameters that I can extract from my<br>video imagery and have been doing for<br>years so we have this program called the<br>surf breaks research program and we have<br>sites around New Zealand that we've<br>elected to study in more detail we've<br>got Adam Juana and Fatih aqui aqui and<br>that's down in in Dunedin and what's<br>interesting about those sites is that<br>the surfing conditions are completely<br>regulated by the port of Otago dredge<br>spoil dumping program which is offshore<br>of here we have Lyell Bay here where the<br>airport that's in Wellington where the<br>airport extension is supposed to<br>influence this or should influence the<br>way the surf changes along that side<br>down here we have Fung amitié and we<br>have in New Zealand one of the most<br>controversial issues in between the<br>fungal Matata<br>surfers and the marina development<br>within the harbour so that's why we have<br>that site and finally we've got our<br>natural sites my new Bay which is a<br>rocky shore break post one of the most<br>famous P huh up to the north which is<br>one of our earliest surfing sites in New<br>Zealand and finally why new e in<br>Gisborne now one of the challenges with<br>monitoring surf is that we're trying to<br>detect a human induced change in a<br>system that is varying hugely not only<br>between seasons but also between years<br>and and through and even long-term<br>changes with changes to the wave climate<br>and in fact if we look more closely in<br>New Zealand our waves are really<br>strongly driven by climate cycles this<br>shows the summer wave conditions and<br>whether or not they're correlated with<br>the Southern Oscillation index so down<br>here in New Zealand our significant wave<br>height or wave height our wave period<br>and the direction of our waves<br>well significant wave height increases<br>with la niñas if we go over here to the<br>States and the west coast of the states<br>in Canada it does the complete opposite<br>you get whig big wave during El Ninos<br>and so the whole Pacific is changing<br>with one side getting high the other<br>side getting low and so on fascinating<br>and because it was a big study we needed<br>all those people on the paper factor on<br>my PhD student Victor Gordo who's just<br>finished worked with the neo wave pine<br>cast that was developed by Richard<br>Gorman at neewa to look at the wave<br>climate in much more detail and he found<br>that not on the Southern Oscillation<br>index was important and waves coming<br>from the Pacific Ocean but all sorts of<br>other wave climates around the oceans we<br>have one of the most complex wave<br>climates in the world here we have the<br>Southern Oscillation index and yes it's<br>correlated with la niñas on the north<br>coast but it's also correlated with El<br>Ninos on the south coast the Southern<br>Ocean of course is a huge driver of wave<br>conditions in New Zealand the Southern<br>Oscillation<br>so that southern annular mode and the<br>zonal wave number three funny name I<br>agree and of course the conditions in<br>the Tasman are important and finally<br>even the Indian Ocean is important<br>because we're situated at a higher<br>latitude than Australia the waves from<br>the Indian Ocean can come round from<br>underneath Australia and hit our<br>southern coast so this indicator which<br>is the dipole mode index which is the<br>movement up and down of the Indian Ocean<br>also affects the wave climate around New<br>Zealand now with a 45 year wave Prime<br>cast that should be enough to see<br>changes we should be able to detect if<br>our wave climate is changing it's<br>problematic<br>I admit because these climate drivers<br>have very long scale changes and so it's<br>difficult to detect a mean change over<br>something that's varying on such a long<br>scale also over 45 years the way we<br>force our models the wind conditions<br>they are also changing the way we<br>measure them is changing but with our<br>best guess our most knowledgable<br>actually is not a guess with our best<br>calculations um we think that they are<br>changing this is the mean wave climate<br>around New Zealand and it's changing by<br>about 2 to 6 centimetres per decade but<br>for a coastal hazard kind of issue it's<br>not the mean conditions that are<br>important<br>it's the extremes and we can see that<br>the size of extreme waves is changing by<br>a few centimeters per year it's not so<br>much the size it's the number of events<br>so all these points down here show that<br>the number of events per decade is also<br>increasing now what's the problem we<br>really really lack validation data New<br>Zealand has only three boys that are<br>functioning all the time around our<br>coast if we look at somewhere like the<br>British Isles they have about 24 25 boys<br>working all the time to validate their<br>home castes so the last thing I'd like<br>to say is that new data is coming online<br>all the time and that new data is the<br>satellite data that we have and one of<br>the things that fascinated me is the<br>effort that people who run satellite<br>programs are going to make it accessible<br>to everyday people so now you don't need<br>to be a super computer program or be<br>able to remove all the clouds yourself<br>you could do it yourself and so I just<br>wanted to finish with this image you<br>know try and get the actual image and so<br>this shows and it's animated and you can<br>go to the site this shows the red dots<br>here show all the satellites that are<br>active in the world right at this moment<br>right now and all those satellites<br>streamed to various commercial operators<br>but also government operators and a lot<br>of them are making that data freely<br>available to us as academics so transfer<br>back so that's all I have to say thank<br>you very much thank you and glad to see<br>so many people here I appreciate you<br>coming and of course I do need to make<br>some acknowledgments I'd first like to<br>acknowledge my family of course the<br>students you make this the best job in<br>the world you know who you are the<br>technical masters who put all the data<br>together they even in the office and the<br>computer people all those people I'd<br>like to acknowledge Mentors<br>and in the beginning it was scientific<br>mentors helping me with the research but<br>gradually through time those people<br>became mentors on how to communicate how<br>to project manage how to navigate the<br>new zealand science system which can be<br>very tricky sometimes<br>on vision math how doing and learning<br>more about that and also I'm really<br>fortunate to have academics and my<br>family to help me along there's a bunch<br>of people that I would call opportunity<br>makers who sometimes don't realize<br>they're helping you but somewhere along<br>the line they open a door that changed<br>your pathway and of course she took the<br>chance when it was there but they made<br>that key thing that made your life<br>different of course the many colleagues<br>that I've worked with the publications<br>that we worked on together and there'll<br>be colleagues in the future that<br>I'm looking forward to working with on<br>new problems but finally I'd like to<br>acknowledge the University of Waikato<br>and you know I came from Canada and I<br>came down to this place in the southern<br>ocean a long way away from the real<br>world as I conceived of at the time but<br>still I have had the ability and I've<br>had the opportunity to create a mark on<br>the world which is absolutely amazing to<br>me and I want to acknowledge Chad and<br>Bruce and Richard price before that have<br>made these opportunities for us no one<br>have finished with one last thing and<br>that's the number two hundred and<br>seventy fourth we're ranked two hundred<br>and seventy fourth if you think of all<br>those universities in South Africa in in<br>in Canada in the states in England and<br>the Netherlands and Germany that is<br>pretty amazing for a small place down in</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
