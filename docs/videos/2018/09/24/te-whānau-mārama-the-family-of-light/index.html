Titled ‘Te Whānau Marama – The Family of Light’, Rangi will discuss new findings covered in his soon to be released book of the same name.<br><br>Professor Matamua says he is excited by the opportunity to share his expertise in Māori astronomy at a time when the celebration of Matariki has seen a massive resurgence. “Matariki has played a key role in the revival of interest in Māori astronomy, but there is so much more to the story. Te Whānau Mārama is another piece of the puzzle people may not know about – another narrative that can deepen our understanding and appreciation of Māori astronomy.”<br><br>Professor Matamua was part of the team that curated the nationally recognised exhibition Te Whānau Mārama at the Waikato Museum. More than 200,000 visitors have participated in the interactive exhibition and this interest in the family of light, coupled with the success of his Living by the Stars facebook page, were the inspiration for writing his second book.<br><br>“I realised people wanted to learn more and that Te Whānau Mārama was a story often left out of our understanding of creation, and the origins of the world in which Māori live.”</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thirty total reward everyone

Kyoto Tina puta<br>Tina Tata Tata well thank you very much<br>for coming along this this evening and<br>to this lecture I suppose some of you<br>might be thinking that this is just<br>going to be a lecture about Maori<br>astronomy or or Metallica maybe but I<br>prefer professorial lecture or inaugural<br>professorial lectures more about talking<br>I suppose a little bit about my journey<br>to be here tonight and to have been<br>given the title of Professor here at<br>this university and some of the research<br>that I'm involved in so that's really<br>what I'm going to talk about now just<br>outside was saying you've got 25 to 35<br>minutes that's not gonna work just sorry<br>might be a bit longer and I don't have<br>many words most of what I've got to show<br>you our images and I've entitled this<br>lecture they far no Maruyama or the<br>family of light and the family of light<br>is the origins of really my research and<br>how I come to be standing in front of<br>you tonight so I suppose we should begin<br>at the beginning and from darkness to<br>light so there are many tribal<br>variations of the snare<br>there are many tribal variations many<br>different areas have their own spin on<br>this and I'm not about to say that what<br>anyone else says is wrong and what I'm<br>saying is more correct I don't have the<br>only version like I say I have the only<br>correct version I have my version and<br>this is where my research begins so as<br>any astronomical class will tell you any<br>astrophysicist will say that everything<br>begins in a singularity everything the<br>whole entire universe was squeezed into<br>this immensely small tight hot space<br>about the size of your thumbnail and<br>then it exploded outwards Maui believed<br>that in the beginning Danny and papa<br>were stuck together innocent brace so<br>tight was that embrace that no light<br>existed and within the Union a number of<br>children or gods were born and it fell<br>upon the eldest Lord or the forest<br>garden earmarked to separate his parents<br>and he tore them apart he ripped them<br>apart sending his father into the sky<br>and leaving his mother here our mother<br>Papa to Onuaku the earth the problem was<br>as after he'd separated his parents the<br>world was still dark and he had two<br>other siblings tumble tumble tumble<br>tumble was our word for darkness for<br>night blackness and I had an uncle Tamil<br>Tamil<br>he was purple and wainui wainui is<br>personified in the oceans and the vast<br>waters and they had a number of children<br>the eldest was there are the son then<br>was the madama the moon followed on by<br>Navi two or all of the stars Nix was he<br>Napoli which is a phosphorus light the<br>putty Khoikhoi which is a gloomy light<br>and the final child of the family of<br>light all too far no ma Roma as he<br>narrow amor which is a very fine<br>delicate beautiful star and if I know ma<br>Roma were held by their father tunnel<br>tunnel in a house and it was the first<br>house ever constructed it's name was Hui<br>getting older and as you walk into a<br>fuddy nui through that door along that<br>wall up against the roof of the ceiling<br>of the house he hung the son then<br>further along the roof of the house at<br>the potable Manila where it meets the<br>roof he hung the moon and he adorned the<br>walls of the house with the Stars<br>and he placed them in patterns and this<br>is the origins of the tukutuku panels<br>that are dual in our houses today and at<br>the back wall of the house he placed he<br>not only but equally in he need o amor<br>and this was the far no ma roma in hua<br>tera Nora and tani tani Lord of the<br>forest also the God who placed the stars<br>and the heavens decided he wants who had<br>wanted to adorn his father and so he<br>enlisted his relation timidity who was<br>the owner of the first canoe my people<br>call this canoe Pinard Ikki others call<br>it who are this is a canoe upon watch<br>tarney had three baskets the first<br>basket held the Sun the second basket<br>held the moon and the final basket held<br>all of the stars and he put them on to<br>the canoe<br>and he spit out across the ocean and<br>they came to a place called the byway or<br>that idea now this is a name that we've<br>given to one of our scholarships here at<br>the university because the buyer way up<br>there Dagny is the water horizon that is<br>a place where the sky meets the ocean<br>and it's a transition point for Thamud<br>et al thani who got to that point and<br>then began to ascend into the heavens<br>and we gave that name to that<br>scholarship for students coming to<br>university high achievers as a<br>transitioning point for them to ascend<br>into the heavens and to achieve<br>greatness so they got into the heavens<br>and the first thing you do I don't know<br>my tribe doesn't have an ocean so I<br>don't know about boats but apparently<br>the first thing you do is drop your<br>anchor and so they threw their anchor<br>overboard attached it to the canoe<br>vasenka the boone up will they walk or<br>thommeri duty or the anchor of the canoe<br>of Thamud EDT is still visible in our<br>sky tonight this is my honor this is the<br>Southern Cross and here are the names<br>within this group of stars now this<br>group of stars is a circumpolar a group<br>of stars meaning it's always in the sky<br>and the South that doesn't rise and sit<br>like the other stars but goes round and<br>around and around and if it wasn't for<br>my Ultima and this anchor all of the<br>stars would float off and disappear this<br>is a point that holds all of the stars<br>in place ensuring that we have a night<br>sky the beautiful night sky we have so<br>Thani finally decided he was going to<br>hang the Stars and patterns and so he<br>began to hang and suspend the major<br>stars<br>and the major star groups and he hung<br>them and place the big star three who<br>were or Antares and he hung up Takuya or<br>serious and all the stars that you see<br>in patterns all of the big ones and so<br>happy was darling with what he'd done<br>that he decided to perform a haka and he<br>put the basket down at his feet while he<br>was in the sky and he did this haka and<br>he got a little bit carried away in his<br>arms were thrusting out and he kicked<br>his leg out and toppled the basket over<br>and scattered the Stars across the night<br>sky now I see my relationship will s'en<br>here tonight<br>this is his Mountain or Peru and this is<br>Donny's basket if you look into the<br>Milky Way you're looking back inside a<br>basket the mouth of a basket with all<br>the stars spilling out of the basket<br>this is hell the Milky Way came to be<br>this is why some of the stars are in<br>patterns and designs in the sky and some<br>of them are scattered randomly across<br>the sky and I want you to take note of<br>this particular star here can't see this<br>image very well there's a bit of light<br>but this star here is the oldest and<br>most sacred of all of the stars this is<br>a to date my favorite star I too thought<br>he was hung outside of the basket<br>purposely and I want to come back to<br>that in a few moments so my research has<br>mainly been dealing with matariki and<br>dealing with disseminating Matariki<br>across the country and I've been very<br>fortunate to have been invited to a<br>number of places to talk about my thirty<br>key or the Pleiades now have probably<br>caused a little bit of controversy in<br>some areas particularly saying that<br>there are nine stars in the cluster as<br>opposed to seven now if you have seven<br>who you Paul Walker okay you row your<br>canoe okay my ancestor left the record<br>of nine he left a record of nine and<br>explains their names explains why<br>they're positioned where they are and<br>what they mean now by no means do I I do<br>not mean to offend anyone that has a<br>different version of the story but this<br>is what I've been promoted<br>as I've been going around discussing my<br>thirty key and one of the things that<br>I've been really trying to do is to move<br>our perception from seeing this these<br>giant balls of gas burning I know I<br>think that's about 460 light years away<br>from Earth to seeing this understanding<br>that for Maori these are not giant balls<br>of gas<br>they are our relations they are our<br>ancestors they are deity they are things<br>that are connected to us throughout our<br>lives and this is<br>Matariki as I understand it there are<br>nine stars mythology the mother or the<br>healer and who eight children that bring<br>our bounty to mankind every year and<br>this is a philosophy in the sky you have<br>a star that deals with our deed or who<br>took our the star here deals with the<br>food we grow in the ground the birds in<br>the sky freshwater saltwater rain winds<br>and our hopes and dreams for for the<br>future so it's about our past our future<br>life and death and everything that we<br>need to survive is encompassed in this<br>philosophy that is mythology and as part<br>of my work I've been trying to support a<br>widening view of how we understand our<br>science because MALDI narrative is<br>embedded with empirical science we are<br>scientists I've not long come back from<br>Hawaii and they call themselves Hawaiian<br>tests we are scientists you don't<br>traverse that expanse of ocean without<br>knowing your stuff they were scientists<br>you don't survive and flourish in a<br>place like this without understanding<br>the science but what our ancestors did<br>wasn't beat it into narrative it becomes<br>part of cultural practice and it becomes<br>part of ceremony and it's the ceremony<br>that keeps the metaphysical spiritual<br>dimension of our knowledge alive and<br>this<br>is how I view my 30 key some of the<br>other things that I've been challenging<br>as part of my research is number one the<br>notion of Seven Sisters and month<br>etiquette being seven sisters yeah there<br>is a Greek myth and yeah I always say<br>you know me and my relation from Lata<br>who know might look like we come from<br>their movie 300 with big muscles but<br>we're not we're not Greeks and Seven<br>Sisters is not a mildly narrative or an<br>understanding of play tease the little<br>lies one gets me the most that is a<br>nelson beast translation he translator i<br>wasn't translated by a mile be that was<br>translated by a non-maori<br>and we perpetuate these myths we say<br>little eyes there is no narrative around<br>little eyes the idea that matariki rises<br>on the same day every year is incorrect<br>because we follow a solar GOG Orion<br>Western calendar and methodius based in<br>a lunar calendar which is 11 days<br>shorter so it doesn't rain rise on the<br>same solar GOG Orion calendar day every<br>year and the other idea that my 13 marks<br>the winter solstice that is not true and<br>I've been pushing back against some of<br>these misconceptions about mythology and<br>who was telling our stories it's full<br>name - my understanding is now a month<br>up what the our ticket are for you<br>Martha<br>the eyes of the Gods I'll feed you mark<br>there watch the people on the East Coast<br>poor mother Ida T which is probably a<br>little bit more correct<br>and we've truncated that shortly there<br>to be not very keen that's how I<br>understand it gets its name as part of<br>the research we've been trying to<br>support people to go outside and look at<br>our environment and understand the<br>movements of the celestial bodies just<br>basic things like understanding the Sun<br>doesn't rise in the same place every day<br>that it rises and sets in different<br>places depend<br>upon the season and when it goes nice in<br>winter<br>my teddy key will rise next to the Sun<br>telling the Sun to come back to the<br>south and bringing us warmth and the<br>summer season the problem with that is<br>that wasn't our major marker and our<br>division of time our ancestors followed<br>a lunar calendar cycle thus lunar<br>calendar cycle is something that led our<br>day-to-day lives there are good days and<br>there are bad days it rises and falls<br>rises and falls and I know lots of<br>people ask me is it a good day to do<br>this is it a bad day to do this I don't<br>know if you want to know go outside and<br>look at the moon you know people want<br>you to tell them what they should be<br>doing the only way that you can truly<br>live by the lunar cycle and understand<br>this mechanism of not only timekeeping<br>but also of determining how well your<br>day is going to be your week your month<br>is by going out and observing the things<br>in our environment and that's what we've<br>done we have moved away from this system<br>and we are following a different system<br>and someone else is telling us how to<br>keep our time and when we should be<br>doing something and there are good<br>nights and days and bad nights sometimes<br>the best day to work is the weekend and<br>the worst days to work on Monday to<br>Friday I've been trying to ring Brendan<br>to tell him I'm not coming in Monday<br>it's called a career<br>I'll see you Friday Brendan's like you<br>get in otherwise it's quarter quarter<br>for the year this is part of a much<br>wider phenomenon where people are<br>starting to return to our traditional<br>lunar calendars and having these sit at<br>another issue that that I've been<br>working on throughout my research is the<br>timing of Matariki<br>and quite often we're going out to<br>celebrate Matariki season and it's not<br>even in the sky it hasn't risen above<br>the horizon yet we're so embedded our<br>understanding of who we are is so<br>ingrained in us is the solar calendar<br>that we follow today that this is the<br>system of timekeeping doesn't work and<br>there are basic things like this my<br>thirty key as a as a star group of stars<br>needs to be five degrees above the<br>horizon while the Sun is sixteen degrees<br>below that's basic any closer the light<br>of the Sun is going to wash out my<br>thirty key and so when you understand<br>that then you understand when my thirty<br>key is not visible in the month of<br>Peabody and the lunar phase of tunnel<br>door because this is too close you<br>insert an additional thirteenth month<br>into our yearly cycle that period of<br>time is called blue Harley or the<br>listless period<br>rou-ha-nee and that is the second<br>Peabody or not Paul Teutul money or<br>Peabody the long extended nights of<br>Peabody<br>my works taken me across the Pacific and<br>I've been lucky enough to particularly<br>work with people in Hawaii where they<br>have Macaulay which is Matariki and<br>actually right throughout the Pacific<br>you'll see that Matariki is the name<br>that they apply to those this cluster of<br>stars I've been fortunate enough to be<br>on a Marsden funded project<br>this is associate professor here my<br>this is on the island of Kahoolawe we in<br>Hawaii<br>thus Island was bombed by the US Navy<br>for a few decades it was actually a<br>place where people from Hawaii went and<br>practice ceremony and was bombed and<br>used as a target range and it was given<br>back to the people of Hawaii and<br>particularly the Native Hawaiians and<br>they have been restoring the island part<br>of that restoration has been maintaining<br>the cultural integrity in their<br>spirituality and they go there every<br>year to feed Maliki to feed the Stars to<br>feed their gods and traditional gods<br>so they place food and do karakia or<br>prayers on these lily or to arden and<br>this is us a one-year our marsden<br>project along with our my colleagues<br>from tamata pnina traveled and<br>celebrated on Koloa with professor<br>calico baker from hawaii and there's<br>been a really really important<br>connection to make I think some of the<br>other milestones perhaps have been the<br>release of the book here that I released<br>18 months ago here in this room and also<br>online and I'm not too sure if many of<br>you have are following this page living<br>by the Stars but it's another platform<br>that trying to disseminate traditional<br>Maori knowledge of astronomy the thing<br>I'm most proud about through the<br>research that I've been conducting for<br>the last few years<br>is the gathering momentum around the wok<br>on AutoKey and the celebration that we<br>hold every rising of Matadi key to feel<br>well outdid and to feed our stars in<br>order for them to continually bring us<br>bouncy and ensure that our cool mother<br>grows and we catch lots of tea tea and<br>this is methodically here as part of<br>this massive cosmic canoe<br>now this canoe was kept in by tata minor<br>KU who was the owner of a cosmic neat<br>that he drops to the earth every day and<br>for 11 months of the year the star is<br>visible this clusters visible he hauls<br>to the sky the souls of all of the<br>people who have departed that day and<br>suspends them from the back of the canoe<br>and here they hang night after night<br>after night and they disappear in the<br>month of hirato which is made Younis and<br>they rise in peabody June July and when<br>they rise we celebrate with a hope top<br>of ceremony where we feed the stars and<br>so this is our lone alter our - ah-hoo<br>that we have put up on running out there<br>which is just south of Kiki and we have<br>been practicing the whole top of<br>ceremony farewelling out dead of the<br>year for them to become stars against<br>the chest of ringing nui we feed the<br>different stars of Matariki so in the<br>lunar phase of pandora we heat a loom<br>ooh we prepare our food we have a fish<br>for an ocean fish for white power we<br>have an ear for white tea Okumura for<br>Tipu our lucu and for temporarily I'd<br>like to say we have a kiddy do but we're<br>environmentally responsible<br>so we had a chicken now was a TT and<br>here we have l 2i l l rather fell ik<br>looking alte not as big as they get in<br>Hawaii but it was pretty cold here and<br>we prepare this woman and this is us up<br>on top of the hill now the lights you<br>can see here are all over the cars<br>driving to be part of the ceremony they<br>came and they came and they just came in<br>the droves to be part of this growing<br>understanding of reviving our<br>traditional practices and our<br>traditional spirituality and here they<br>are with the headlamps the Smurfs came<br>marching one by one coming up to the top<br>of rainy Atiyah in waiting waiting with<br>a tunnel or moon faced with the rise of<br>Matariki in the sky for us to take our<br>read and then we take the food from them<br>and place it on the to our and here we<br>are conducting our karakia thanking the<br>stars for the bounty that they have<br>brought us sending our wishes and to the<br>heavens along with our deed of the year<br>that's passed and the Sun rises and<br>there are children and adults and<br>communities coming to be involved many<br>of the students from this University<br>here they are here eating all of the<br>this opens the Martha Hilda though or<br>our Maori new year so we're - from here<br>I put this image up because I've been<br>this year I did 36 Matariki lectures in<br>two months from Auckland down to Dunedin<br>was as far south as I week<br>and I'm kind of sick of Matariki I have<br>to be honest I love the practice and but<br>talking about it and the reason is is<br>because that's one of a thousand Maori<br>stars that's one out of a hundred and<br>three Maori constellations all of them<br>having their own narrative their own<br>purpose their own practice and we're<br>just infatuated the only time anyone<br>wants to be an astronomer is when it's<br>my thirty key time okay we are<br>disconnected from our sky<br>we are estranged from our sky and often<br>from our environment this is one<br>constellation of 103 this is tuna Nui or<br>the great eel all of these different<br>points of stars are names of eels and<br>when they run this cluster starts its<br>pre-dawn rise in the month of November<br>and ends in May when this star is in the<br>sky and you align it either with the<br>full moon the day after the full moon or<br>the day before the full moon that<br>species of the old will run in the<br>rivers and so this is one piece of time<br>keeping my suppose one tool that our<br>ancestors followed and was built into<br>our cycles and our environmental cycles<br>this is always also the pathways the<br>pathway that the Eels took as they<br>descended from the heavens before the<br>Sun was placed in the sky coming down to<br>earth so Sidney fee to keep that onion<br>there are so many many stars in the sky<br>from here I'm hoping to begin a funny<br>call coredegon Marley or an Institute of<br>mildly astronomy I'm hoping to gather<br>people with expertise and students who<br>are interested in learning about the<br>other 999 stars and begin to practice<br>and revive our core core any how<br>astronomical practices I want to grow<br>another generation of Maori astronomer<br>this practice has been missing from<br>and from Maori for generations and for<br>me I'd like to revive this this is not<br>saying that they can't be<br>astrophysicists I really like Star Wars<br>and The Big Bang Theory but while I<br>really enjoy that there is a cultural<br>perspective for me that is missing from<br>our study and I want to establish this<br>Institute and grow a new generation of<br>Maori astronomer I'm here because of<br>this individual that is my ancestor he<br>me or not the peaky cortical who was a<br>donor a fire and a tomahawk irani<br>the man next to him is to talk inaho<br>that is a donor from Manipur - he is<br>Elton Biss main informant for most of<br>his writing and such an influential<br>character and we probably don't realize<br>just how influential he was the Maori<br>months that we follow today come from<br>him the core Co he Milner was an<br>astronomer and he had the foresight in<br>1898 to begin a manuscript of 400 pages<br>where he records the thousand names I'm<br>talking about a hundred and three<br>constellations every one of them he<br>gives a narrative what they mean how to<br>read them when they rise when they see<br>most importantly for me and the center<br>of that book of their manuscript he<br>writes a curriculum of how to teach in a<br>funny call order I'm here because of him<br>having passed their knowledge down to<br>his son and that manuscript who was<br>passed down to his grandfather his<br>grandson and from him who was my<br>grandfather to me and that's why I put<br>him up there just to as an example he<br>wasn't the only person like that in the<br>camp<br>all tribes had their astronomical<br>experts he just had the foresight to<br>write that knowledge and hand it down I<br>want to come back to this though I'm<br>just about finished yes the star here<br>the star is uh today like I said before<br>this is the great star outside of the<br>Milky Way all of the stars here in the<br>Milky Way and here is uh truth they it<br>is the brightest star outside of the<br>Milky Way not the brightest star in the<br>sky but as the brightest star out side<br>of the Milky Way and that is because the<br>star is Topol here's a corner and as a<br>thought owner it is his responsibility<br>to ensure the cultural and spiritual<br>integrity of everything else in the<br>Milky Way if it wasn't for him<br>maintaining the top of the night sky the<br>night sky would not move in unison and<br>everything would collapse<br>now his younger brother who were the<br>star Antares approached him early in the<br>piece and said to him brother<br>return to the Milky Way come and join us<br>and he said I cannot do that I cannot do<br>that because if I join you<br>then my topper will be negated the night<br>sky will lose its integrity and<br>everything will collapse and for me I<br>likened the star our two day to my<br>faculty of if --mess the Faculty of<br>Maori and Indigenous Studies Maori and<br>Indigenous Studies for me and this<br>faculty has been of all the places I've<br>worked this has been for me the most<br>important place I've come to has been<br>delve into the depths of my research I<br>work with what I believe to be the most<br>fantastic people on the face of the<br>earth<br>I admire the staff and students of my<br>faculty and I love the staff and<br>students of my faculty and as a faculty<br>for me I see our role as ensuring the<br>cultural and spiritual integrity of this<br>institution to ensure that we function<br>yes today he may sit outside the Milky<br>Way but it has a role and a purpose for<br>doing so and on to my last slide this is<br>my mentor my uncle and my landlord I was<br>taken by my grandfather to Poe as a 14<br>year old to learn how to do fake audible<br>30 years later he's still teaching me<br>how to do play caught it all when I<br>first went to university I was taken by<br>him into his class and I instantly in my<br>first class said I want to be like my<br>uncle I'm still trying to get there but<br>for me this is one of those moments<br>where I want everyone to know that my<br>journey here has only been possible<br>because of the support systems that I've<br>had around me and I want to acknowledge<br>my mentor Poe my his
