Most recently he has been working In Tanzania, where it’s not uncommon for schools to have up to 200 children in a single class. He worked with educators to help teachers there develop and align their formative assessment and teaching. The result was a set of Assessment Guidelines with 100,000 copies printed for distribution across East Africa.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

on that you do not wish<br>to acknowledge or you not aware the<br>caliber of disaster indicated but the<br>lining achievement of our children today<br>well you got trouble my friends you got<br>trouble<br>and I say trouble right here in River<br>City you see you got to find a way to<br>help to keep the young ones achieving in<br>school trouble trouble trouble trouble<br>yes we got trouble right here in River<br>City and that starts with T and that<br>rhymes with sorry that's that's that's<br>trouble the capital T and that rhymes<br>with test that starts with test that<br>rhymes with best and that's the way to<br>get out of this trouble testing is the<br>solution to our problems in helping our<br>students achieve with apologies to the<br>music man I want to talk a bit about<br>what I call the measure man but what I<br>really call the measure of man and the<br>reason I chose the music man as a sort<br>of a start for it is I know if you know<br>the story of the music man but basically<br>be able to con artist who comes in he he<br>tries to con the city about that and get<br>me know I don't concern myself to be a<br>con artist but what I do have an<br>interesting story to tell and that is<br>when I first got interested in testing<br>in schooling and becoming a teacher I<br>was really quite concerned because at<br>the time they had introduced a new<br>testing program in British Columbia and<br>all of a sudden all the graduating<br>students would have to write exams and<br>as part of those exams it was 40% of<br>their grade and I said well this can't<br>be a good solution to the problem right<br>they want accountability and all they<br>wanted to have some sort of common<br>measure of achievement and I said this<br>is just a disaster this how's this going<br>to help so one<br>my professors at the time said you know<br>dawn just take your time to learn a bit<br>about this and so I started to read<br>about it and just like the music men in<br>the story that he falls in love I kind<br>of fell in love with testing so I know<br>you all laugh at that but it's true I<br>mean for me it is a real passion and<br>that's what I really want to start to<br>talk about and this is what I'm going to<br>talk about my journey today that led me<br>and hopefully all of you to start to<br>love testing as well so when I when I<br>speak and when I talk I like to use<br>analogies and metaphors now that<br>sometimes it's confusing for people<br>because I'm a quantitative researcher<br>and they don't think we can work with<br>metaphors and analogies so well we'll<br>see how we do here I will argue that<br>tests are like rocks now how many of you<br>have seen a rock before okay so for<br>those who didn't put your hands up those<br>are the little round things on the<br>ground so we have several of them other<br>so how many of you ever written a test<br>probably most of you I've just like the<br>rocks so you can see the similarity<br>between the two right right there but I<br>can make it even stronger than that how<br>many of you have ever been hurt by a<br>rock right felt the pain of a rock right<br>you can all remember how many of you<br>have ever felt the pain of a test yeah<br>now you're seeing the comic how they<br>connect so well right so it's not it's<br>much more than an analogy all right so<br>all kidding aside what I talked about<br>with tests is we've all experienced<br>we've never thought deeply about them<br>and - same with rocks as you look at<br>rocks from the distance they look quite<br>plain normal they're very just it's a<br>walk let's be honest but as you start to<br>get closer you look more closely at the<br>rocks you see there's actually quite a<br>bit complexity underneath that surface<br>of the rock and that's exactly the same<br>with tests you know once I started to<br>look at tests a little more closely I<br>started to appreciate just how the<br>complexity of testing and some of the<br>real amazing things that we've done with<br>testing<br>over the years what we can do with some<br>potential of them but also some of the<br>real pitfalls that we get into so that's<br>one way talk to you about today is some<br>of two aspects of my research one is<br>looking at large-scale testing and the<br>other is looking at you know more<br>classroom testing and some of my work on<br>that<br>so just to give you a sense how many<br>test questions do we need on a test now<br>let me give you a bit of the science<br>that's come up on testing we can<br>actually measure stuff that's a pretty I<br>mean I've got a ruler I can measure<br>height quite quite simply measuring what<br>you're thinking right now is more<br>complex measuring your attitudes<br>measuring your abilities in math that's<br>more complex but is it we actually have<br>the tools right now to develop tests<br>that for every question you answer<br>depending on the answer you give I can<br>choose I can of a computer choose I can<br>choose the next question to give the<br>tests will adapt to you as you respond<br>to it and what that will let me do is<br>very quickly get to your ability or what<br>you're thinking now to give you a sense<br>you've all done this game before 20<br>questions that's the exact same kind of<br>thing that we can do with testing we can<br>use a series of questions and adapt them<br>to your responses to get to specifically<br>what you're thinking or in this case<br>your ability in math or in reading write<br>the new theory on this is called modern<br>test score theory because it was<br>developed in 1960 right we're slow in<br>the measurement field to adapt but in<br>fact when a modern test score theory<br>came out in 1960 there was not a<br>computer on the planet that could run it<br>it was that the mathematics is so<br>complex today that computer right there<br>doesn't about three seconds you can take<br>a full set of data for a whole country<br>of testing and give you all the data in<br>three seconds so that's the changes this<br>in computing power but that modern test<br>score theory or what we now call item<br>response theory<br>allows us to develop large scale tests<br>that can really focus in on abilities on<br>your on your on your structures in terms<br>of what your thinking your attitudes and<br>get really good sense of how good you<br>are in whatever thing we're trying to<br>measure ie map reading usually academic<br>achievement type thing now any of you<br>have written any tests like the GRE or<br>the MCATs the Isles TOEFL all these<br>large scale tests they're all by RT<br>based on response based tests every one<br>of them they have a lot of power exam we<br>can adapt them for each person we<br>typically don't do that because of<br>political issues it's not fair there's<br>one person only have to write 20 items<br>another person have to write 50 items so<br>people get a little nervous about that<br>so we've often had to change the system<br>just to deal with the politics of<br>testing which of course is another part<br>of my research is what happens when we<br>deal with these kinds of things so that<br>gives you one sense I one thing I've<br>done a lot of work in is the whole area<br>of large scale test this is what got me<br>started is I was looking at how to make<br>tests shorter because I don't like them<br>to begin with so I was trying to do that<br>I don't like marking them either that's<br>another story but what one things I got<br>into was this whole notion of what can<br>we gain from tests and so one of my<br>first big studies was looking at what I<br>would call predictors of achieve and we<br>looked at school factors and student<br>factors and teacher factors that seem to<br>make a difference in the achievement of<br>children so a good example of this is a<br>study we want my first studies I've done<br>it's still one of my most cited studies<br>I think times a benefit on this one but<br>basically what we found was that the<br>vast majority of the difference is not<br>due to teachers I hate to say this it's<br>not due to school it's due to the<br>background of children this is what they<br>come to a school or come to a classroom<br>environment how<br>a big impact on their achievement on any<br>kind of test their social economic<br>status matters a number of books no home<br>you know all the kinds of things we<br>think of language background things like<br>that but there are other things that do<br>matter so at this teacher level we seem<br>to have found some evidence that<br>teachers who teach mathematics in the<br>morning seem to be result in higher<br>achievement in math we know that the<br>gender of a teacher can matter we've<br>seen some evidence of that for certain<br>subject areas subject area knowledge<br>seems to have some impact not as much as<br>we'd like sometimes but it's definitely<br>there other things at the school matter<br>so for example schools larger school or<br>smaller school right it seems that<br>larger schools seem to result in higher<br>achievement now what that causes a whole<br>different story because it could simply<br>be a matter of where they're located<br>because we've also seen evidence that<br>being in suburban locations seems to be<br>there now you're getting to<br>socioeconomic status as well so these<br>are all complex things that we get the<br>base measure but what it means after<br>that is much harder another one that<br>seems to matter on this is the climate<br>of the school and what I mean by that is<br>how much the school cares about students<br>a number one predictor at a school level<br>is what we call the discipline climate<br>do children think the school is a fair<br>place or the teachers fair or the<br>principal's seen as being fair am i<br>treated with respect to the students<br>those schools seem to have higher<br>achievement results than schools that<br>don't have the same kind of measure so<br>we've got a lot of work around<br>achievement we've also done some work on<br>what I call health outcomes and this is<br>more interest run because we can't seem<br>to find any school level factors that<br>matter there we there's a small amount<br>but it doesn't seem to matter and we've<br>also noticed a lot of differences across<br>different countries so for example does<br>anybody here and I've talked about this<br>before you know what the best schools<br>are in the world for children<br>you probably won't believe the answer<br>United States of America do you want to<br>wear some of the worst schools are in<br>the world for children right we talk<br>about the u.s. is having a slope like<br>this right the school your child goes to<br>matters a lot the country I come from<br>which you may have picked up on is<br>Canada and our slopes like this actually<br>does it really matter which school your<br>child goes to in terms of the quality of<br>education that they'll receive we're<br>much more equitable than our outcomes<br>for children it doesn't mean there are<br>differences but the school level<br>differences are much less New Zealand I<br>don't know the data on yet I'm still<br>trying to find that one but I suspect<br>you're somewhere there so again this is<br>a policy decision right because the only<br>u.s. is like this you got high cheap and<br>at the one end and much low at the end<br>so if you really if you want to system<br>in that but let's just in the back now I<br>was trying to using something redone is<br>trying to bring you this far up this way<br>as we go through that's where our<br>challenges are because the hardest<br>research is actually finding out what<br>teachers can do differently and what we<br>are it's much harder to serve that<br>directly so that's a big part of the<br>research I've been working on the last<br>couple of years all right so I want to<br>talk a bit about what we can't you're<br>through these tests so we know we can<br>measure academic achievement that that's<br>not a problem we can actually measure<br>attitudes at least what people tell us<br>are their attitudes we can measure<br>perceptions but of course nowadays what<br>we're interested in measuring things<br>like integrity right communication<br>empathy<br>now I bring those ones up in red because<br>we actually did a study with medical<br>students people applying to be to be<br>doctors to go into medical school so in<br>North America to be coming to going to<br>medical school you must first have three<br>years of University and then you apply<br>separately to do that and so it's a very<br>competitive process for example that my<br>university there are six thousand<br>applicants each year they narrow that<br>down to four hundred and fifty and then<br>they narrow that down to one hundred so<br>that's every year one hundred students<br>will get in out of approximately a pool<br>of six thousand so the final process<br>used to be something called an interview<br>just a giant panel interview and there's<br>been some research out of McMaster<br>University that said these don't work<br>and they've changed the model to use<br>something called the multiple mini<br>interview where each applicant goes<br>through a series of interviews little<br>small scenarios and what they're<br>actually trying to measure are these<br>skills up their communication empathy<br>critical thinking problem-solving and<br>they go through each station and they<br>each station measures one or two of<br>these traits and at the end they make<br>decisions and who should get into<br>Medical School from the results of this<br>of this MMI as they call it so our<br>research what we did we looked at I said<br>are we actually measuring these traits<br>and so we took all the data and we do<br>something called factor analysis and we<br>break it down and we look at and say<br>what are the traits coming out and so<br>we're trying to measure in this case<br>there's actually five sorry there's<br>eight trait so we were trying to measure<br>and there's across eight stations and<br>they had multiple transportation and<br>we've got a perfect result we've got<br>eight factors we were happy except for<br>one small little detail the factors we<br>got were the eight stations not the<br>traits so every station seemed to create<br>some sort of global response that<br>students got measured on the applicants<br>got measured on not the traits so we<br>couldn't measure communication try as I<br>might I tried every kind of statistical<br>we don't cheat in statistics but we<br>definitely manipulates so so I tried<br>everything to help the data get to where<br>I wanted to it didn't get there it just<br>those those eight stations clearly came<br>out so what we've what we basically<br>concluded is that these complex traits<br>that we're trying to measure are<br>actually very difficult to separate from<br>each other and they're very contextual<br>they each situation each little multi<br>mini interview actually controlled what<br>we were measuring in the end we got a<br>global measure that seemed to be<br>readiness to become a doctor or what we<br>might call professionalism but this idea<br>that we're measuring independent traits<br>couldn't get them and I argue you<br>actually can't they're in and they're<br>too complex and then two interrelated to<br>do that now this is a really important<br>study because the same time I I don't<br>know if it hasn't caught on here because<br>the structures but police forces have<br>been using it since then I've been asked<br>to consult on that and how they could<br>use it to develop items on that medical<br>schools dental schools nursing program<br>become a really dominant model of it<br>because it seems to work globally<br>it just doesn't capture these things at<br>a smaller level now I bring this up<br>because you may have heard of this term<br>called 21st century of learning skills<br>and you're all smiling right but you<br>know they've been around for a while you<br>I can show you doctors from 1924 where<br>we list the same skills largely they've<br>been there for quite some time but<br>there's a lot of demand I've been asked<br>in several times to join commit to<br>develop measures of resilience or or<br>grit<br>I tell people watch the movie but those<br>kinds of things are we're trying to and<br>we can we just<br>I say we can't do that it's too you<br>can't capture those things independently<br>of each other and I have a real issue<br>with trying to use a measurement<br>community to try to develop these things<br>to push that agenda I think they're<br>important skills but we have to be very<br>careful as we attempt to measure them so<br>that's one thing I've really tried to<br>push back on is this notion<br>trying to capture these these specific<br>little skills because they're very<br>contextual and they're very challenging<br>alright so I now want to talk a little<br>bit about sort of the next area of<br>research that I've gone into and done a<br>lot of work in and and this one's been<br>interesting because it really brings me<br>back to where I started<br>and just to give you a sense whoa how do<br>I explain this best to talk about this<br>when I started teaching I I was a person<br>who thought testing took a lot of time<br>and it wasn't worth doing so I I was<br>looking for ways out of the testing<br>regime and I found a solution asked my<br>students to develop the criteria to<br>which they'd marked themselves on their<br>assignment I asked my students to write<br>their own report cards I asked my<br>students to monitor their own learning<br>based on outcome and I sat back and<br>watched them do this the parents loved<br>me<br>they got lots of report cards and I was<br>enjoying teaching because I got to spend<br>all my time teaching while they did all<br>the assessment of their work<br>what I discovered since then was a whole<br>science and research has been evolving<br>around the whole areas of<br>self-regulation that actually captured<br>some things I stumbled upon quite by<br>accident I claimed no research that<br>drove me to do that to begin with but it<br>did lead me down this path where I am<br>today so what were I taught what I want<br>to talk about now is this whole idea of<br>where we're coming from in today's<br>consumes which I don't think are all<br>that different from before I was<br>certainly trying to get students to be<br>more self engaged in learning but the<br>current school environment has really<br>created what I would say are<br>increasingly straining complex teaching<br>environments it's harder to be a teacher<br>because for many of us that classrooms<br>look different immigration is changing<br>integration integration classes<br>integration of students it's a different<br>world in many ways I don't think<br>students have changed all that much but<br>for the interactions are changing the<br>accountability motion<br>evolution is still there both internal<br>and external I have real challenges with<br>external accountability and I push back<br>a lot of that in my research but I do<br>believe strongly an internal<br>accountability and that's that<br>professional responsibilities but also<br>this whole aspect of opportunity to<br>learn I'll talk a bit about this at the<br>end when I give another examples of my<br>research but basically we're asking<br>students to get involved in very complex<br>learning yet they don't have equal<br>access to the resources to get there and<br>also the whole knowledge again the<br>suffering and learning the critical<br>thinking the grit these are much more<br>complex things that we used to talk<br>about so in doing that we're asking<br>students to be much more engaged in<br>their self regulated learning to really<br>monitor their learning we want them to<br>identify their strengths their<br>weaknesses we want them to set<br>short-term and long-term goals I can<br>honestly tell you that I've worked with<br>teachers for many years as teachers we<br>struggle with these things and now we're<br>trying to help our students with that<br>that's a challenge for us and of course<br>we want these our students doing this<br>earlier so this is where my path is<br>would have been kind of interesting<br>because I told you I've been very<br>interested in a lot of large-scale<br>testing but I started with classroom<br>assessment that was my first real<br>passion and trying to figure the game of<br>classroom assessment and my path through<br>my research even though it's a lot of<br>work the large scale is also drifted<br>back to classroom assessment and the<br>power of classroom assessment and the<br>challenges and opportunities within that<br>so it's a winding trail but it's brought<br>me back to where I started and I want to<br>finish up and show you a couple of<br>examples of the work I've been doing in<br>this field<br>that sort of highlight these areas so<br>one of mr. mentioned I've been working<br>with the joint committee for students on<br>four standards on educational evaluation<br>and we were asked to do a revision of<br>something called the classroom about our<br>student evaluation standards<br>so the Joint Committee is best known for<br>its work on program evaluation standards<br>it then produced the classroom so the<br>student evaluation standards and also<br>the personnel evaluation standards I've<br>worked on the last two our last revision<br>I was asked to chair the committee and<br>we spent four years developing a set of<br>standards for teachers to use that would<br>guide their instruction in terms of<br>assessment now what we purposely did in<br>this and for those interns in the field<br>we did not do what the EPA didn't go<br>after what they call the test standards<br>we were trying to avoid that but what we<br>were trying to do is capture especially<br>in the u.s. their kind of structure for<br>a classroom assessment and some of the<br>rules of the game that they were playing<br>by which I have to tell you if you<br>haven't seen it is different they<br>education system in the u.s. approaches<br>teaching and assessment very different<br>they're much more under diagnostic<br>always into that kind of monitoring<br>approach so we really have to try to<br>watch our language around this now the<br>Joint Committee is a group of 14<br>educational recognized organizations so<br>we're talking about AARA American<br>Education Research Association APA<br>American Psychological Association I<br>also has Canadian ones cssc Canadian<br>evaluation Association American<br>evaluation Association so a lot of the<br>biggest educational type groups so they<br>oversaw our work so in four years what<br>we develop was a set of standards that<br>really tried to show classroom<br>assessment is something that is about<br>supporting student learning now anyway<br>all say this is obvious it's not to the<br>American educators so what we've done is<br>in doing this we've created a couple of<br>and this is where all the the original<br>student evaluation standards were 258<br>pages somewhere around there and we<br>think the total readership was eight<br>we're not sure but I think ten books got<br>read but not a very reads the books they<br>buy so but we've had a real they had a<br>real problem selling them so what we<br>want to do is create a much small<br>document that would be like a handbook<br>that teacher to be able to use so in<br>doing that we spent four years taking 37<br>standards that were there before<br>revising them and then trying to make<br>them much more user-friendly and to give<br>some guidelines for teacher use the<br>result is a reduced amount of standards<br>we're basically down to 17 standards and<br>we try to capture the breadth of things<br>that we thought would cover formative<br>assessment and classroom assessment so<br>and we then organize them in a very<br>different way we started with what we<br>call foundations as you can see here<br>right and these are kind of things that<br>we talked about in terms of the basics<br>again my walk the foundations we then<br>switched into something called use and<br>we tried to put us over an orderly<br>system into how people would use these<br>assessment standards write or use<br>assessment in general so right from the<br>idea of starting with student<br>performance how do you how do you<br>analyze that and then how do you get<br>feedback and follow-up and things like<br>that so that's been a lot of working in<br>that area now the interesting one and<br>this one for me even though we call<br>feedback I do want to give it a quick<br>side story I don't talk about feedback<br>anymore one things that we've discovered<br>and the reason we put its own separate<br>section here was feedback is largely<br>seen as one of the most effective ways<br>of supporting learning so from an<br>assessment perspective the better the<br>feedback you give the more effective the<br>learning will be the problem with<br>feedback is it's very transmissive it's<br>very unidirectional even we talk about<br>others it's very interesting so some of<br>my research with medical resource to<br>Daan's has been more around a much more<br>dialogic approach and that is a dialogue<br>between the student and the teacher if<br>you want or between two students and<br>they start to call that the feedback<br>dialogues the problem we still had was<br>the nerve the term feedback still<br>created that issue of directionality so<br>we start<br>learning dialogues and what we did is we<br>discovered we watched in the case of the<br>medical students we had the student<br>working with the with the attending and<br>was much more of a dialogue you could<br>actually see the attending learning as a<br>student was as well I then transfer this<br>over to a grade 9 classroom so for year<br>10 classroom math class we were watching<br>two students talk about an assignment<br>they did separately they were doing<br>feedback but I had watched him they<br>started asking questions of each other<br>and all of a sudden you could see ball<br>students think about what they had done<br>a little differently and so we talked<br>about it being a learning dialogue and<br>that switched our language we have kept<br>it around feedback for now but I'm going<br>to argue from now on that this is<br>actually a dialogue it's a learning<br>dialogue as opposed to a feedback and<br>assessment dialogue right it's like it's<br>a reporting and then lastly of course my<br>passion is the whole issue around<br>quality how do we assure good quality of<br>assessments and what we decide to put<br>right up front was the whole issue of<br>diversity and exceptionality this is for<br>the u.s. a big jump in that so we<br>thought was critical to put it right up<br>right up front where we got the most<br>pushback not from teachers but from<br>people in the associations was we put<br>reliability and validity together which<br>of course anybody that's in the<br>measurement field says oh you got to<br>talk with those separately because there<br>are such separate constructs but the<br>field doesn't talk that way and we were<br>trying to make this useful for teachers<br>so and the last one we put in we want to<br>get into something called reflection<br>meta-analysis you want to call it but<br>again when you're trying to use teacher<br>friendly terms so the guidelines the<br>standards I should say have a set of a<br>sentence for each one what they means<br>and then a set of guidelines they give<br>guidance for that easy to use and we've<br>tried something different with them as<br>well we put them on Google Doc are not<br>Google Amazon to sell and so we've<br>actually use Amazon as a<br>as a mechanism uptakes been better it<br>still needs some work so we're working<br>on how to do that<br>I tried argue with the United States I<br>said each state just by the rights to<br>the book and you could use it freely and<br>but apparently they can't give up five<br>six hundred dollars to get the rights so<br>they're so controlled financially so<br>we've had to go a different way and<br>that's another story for another day<br>isn't it so I do want to finish up with<br>a couple of interesting new studies that<br>I've been working on and this is really<br>around trying to find out ways to get<br>teachers much more effective in<br>classroom assessment I'll say it right<br>now for those of you in the room that<br>believe in assessment literacy I don't I<br>think we we spend way too much time to<br>trying to find out if people are<br>literate when we actually know they<br>aren't so I've been focusing on how to<br>get them literate in the world of<br>assessment and that's been a lot of our<br>research creating models of professional<br>learning that support assessment<br>development in teaching and what I've<br>discovered is it actually works across<br>context so the one I'm going to finish<br>up with is we've been working for the<br>last three years in in Tanzania in rural<br>Tanzania and this is part of a funded<br>project so this is a school just the<br>morning assembly and this is a grade or<br>a year three classroom one of the<br>smaller ones this class had 96 students<br>in it so for year three and one of the<br>things were and this is just give you a<br>sample of another one this is a year the<br>classroom it was actually on the smaller<br>year one classroom it only had 105<br>students in it we did have one school<br>that a hundred had 198 students in it<br>and I was told there's another one that<br>had 240 so I didn't get to that school<br>but basically what we did in this study<br>was we took a model I worked with<br>African colleagues it's is not me coming<br>to say how to do things it was me<br>working with my colleagues and we looked<br>for a way to help teachers develop some<br>skills and assessment so one of the<br>things that's happening in Africa is<br>every teacher must assess every student<br>every day<br>so now do that do the math that's a lot<br>so we were trying to show it well<br>there's different ways you can do it<br>says it doesn't have to be formal the<br>classic wall they were doing there was<br>heed asking questions doing get the<br>answer check if they got it right got it<br>wrong go the next student we said well<br>let's change that get the students in<br>small groups ask the question how the<br>students work together teacher said they<br>can't do that so they'll be they'll be<br>running all over the place<br>well he said well let's try it tried it<br>students loved it they got to talk to<br>each other teachers walked around only<br>had 16 20 cable to look at as opposed to<br>140 students and then all of a sudden<br>said you know these things might help us<br>to some extent so we got into issues of<br>questioning and what we did we used<br>something called instructional rounds<br>where they actually watch each other<br>teach so over time they watch each other<br>they give to others some feedback in<br>terms of what was working other people<br>call this lesson study depends on the<br>context you're in they didn't want to<br>have it be evaluative so we kept that<br>out and we also provided in between we<br>did a lot of work in between and giving<br>some strategies for questioning for<br>writing multiple choice items for<br>writing different kinds of questions<br>different kinds of activities feedback<br>some interesting stories on those but<br>throughout it we got their stories of<br>what they were learning and that we then<br>turned into a book called the classroom<br>assessment guidelines and what I want to<br>talk about here is what what the book<br>contains is learning stories that they<br>go on from our observations and we<br>modify them a little bit depending on<br>the situation and we captured the<br>different examples of classroom assess<br>what they were doing interestingly<br>almost every situation that came up was<br>similar to context I had seen in the<br>North American or North American<br>classrooms<br>different kinds of challenges but same<br>questions same difficulties with certain<br>students being off task you know all the<br>things that we see in a<br>possum they were seeing as well so the<br>differences weren't as great as we<br>thought<br>but Turner you can imagine you know when<br>you got a hundred twenty students by the<br>way no textbooks sometimes uh you know<br>again this is me I'm a bit even though I<br>quantitative research random they were<br>running out of desks so the government<br>brought in more desks so I got there<br>between two visits and all of a sudden<br>is a giant piled a desk outside the<br>building right<br>they had no room for the desks so they<br>had them but they used own room so they<br>had this beautiful wit I love the wood I<br>prefer the no I like wood so I want to<br>take the wood home because it was so<br>nice anyway sorry sorry alright<br>but here's it so I have to turn the side<br>there because this is another part of<br>the contextual part of all this and that<br>is I had all these great photos of<br>students learnings that we don't do that<br>here all of our textbooks in our books<br>use cartoon type drawings of what's<br>happening the classrooms so what we did<br>is we hired an artist to draw some of<br>the things we talked about and saw and<br>he's basically conceptualized it and<br>then that's throughout the book are<br>these examples of the of the students<br>working in these cartoons and just<br>recently we were presenting at wera and<br>my colleague with Shira said I think<br>there's a whole paper on this whole idea<br>of how do we contextualize<br>these guidelines and so and how do we<br>talk about that process of doing that<br>now for me this I would have never<br>thought of this is unless that's guy<br>alright I would have thought but but I<br>see the value of that and it really fits<br>into some of the things that I've<br>learned since I've been here at the<br>waikato as well this idea of the by<br>cultural nature of the country and<br>contextualize learning i I just been<br>woken up to it so to speak and for me<br>that is the pleasure of being a<br>researcher is every day there's an<br>opportunity to move forward and think<br>differently about the things you've done<br>it can be a little thing it can be a<br>comment that was made in this case about<br>it one of the questions in the audience<br>came about have you thought about<br>talking about that and that's what I<br>think is so great about being an<br>academic researcher being education<br>researcher and so for that even today I<br>stand in front of you looking out into<br>what I call the fog but if you look<br>closely even through that fog there's<br>bits of light bits of land forming new<br>ideas that are starting to form and<br>that's what I have to thank for my<br>colleagues most the students I work with<br>the the research I've been honored to be<br>part of and I will continue to do that<br>and I hope you will do that as well -<br>your journey I hope we'll have the<br>chance to work together on many of these<br>things so with that I do want to say<br>thank you for for being here today I do<br>want to have a special thank you can you<br>see her my daughter is here from Canada<br>someone there she is it so yeah so thank<br>you so so much for being here and I see<br>my 35 minutes is bang I got lucky on<br>that you see up to measuring guide we<br>got it that matters right so thank you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
