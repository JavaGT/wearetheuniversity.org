font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>ts is doing a PhD in mid Sun University<br>of Otago Wellington her supervisors are<br>Sonny Collins Elliott Bell and Gabriel<br>Jenkins the topic is the therapeutic<br>crafting of love journey to the core of<br>the clinical encounter with patients at<br>risk for suicide<br>hi please take a look at this picture<br>and try to identify the emotion that<br>comes to you hold on to it and I'll get<br>back to it I work in clinical suicide<br>ology studying how the therapeutic<br>encounter can be affected by the way<br>clinicians feel like any other patients<br>suicidal people need a strong<br>therapeutic relationship to benefit from<br>therapy yet they can be difficult so<br>that clinicians tend to feel manipulated<br>or anxious and therefore can be avoidant<br>or rejecting of suicidal patients which<br>can have lethal consequences on the<br>other hand conditions positive feelings<br>of closeness and affiliation or<br>associated with better outcomes yet<br>maybe because it is uncommon<br>this is rarely studied in regards to<br>suicidal patients so we address this<br>knowledge gap by using a mixed method<br>designed to explore specifically the<br>stance of clinicians who feel positively<br>inclined or like working with suicidal<br>patients first we used a national survey<br>to estimate the prevalence and of the<br>267 clinicians who took the survey in<br>New Zealand just under 15% declared that<br>they liked working with our patients we<br>invited them to a second study where we<br>used grounded theory to construct an<br>understanding of the positive<br>inclination we conducted 12 interviews<br>in total and at the core of the<br>therapeutic encounter we found<br>clinicians experienced of forming a deep<br>emotional connection with the suicidal<br>patients and this was both what was<br>soothing for patients<br>and deeply satisfying for clinicians<br>themselves first clinicians empathize<br>with a patient's distress then they sit<br>with the shared emotion this creates an<br>interpersonal emotional regulation where<br>patients benefit from clinicians own<br>ability to bear and regulate difficult<br>emotion akin to a mother who uses her<br>capacity to become to calm her baby in<br>time this emotional connection induces<br>an attachment which is ultimately<br>therapeutic suicidality decreases as<br>connectedness grows so back to the<br>picture to use an analogy where most of<br>us would feel annoyed with a stubborn<br>dog or anxious with an aggressive one<br>these conditions instead strive to see<br>this to see past the behavior and feel<br>warm and compassionate by exercising<br>their empathic ability these clinicians<br>whom I call our AHA Commission's have<br>developed the art of crafting laws<br>thanks T is a very powerful slide there<br>and I love the way you started with it<br>to get us thinking about it and came<br>back to it at the end and also this is a<br>great example of how you can actually<br>tear all elements of your research from<br>the background the Christians and how<br>you did it and your findings and three<br>minutes so well done in great body<br>language I kept on finding myself<br>leaning forward and leaning forward and<br>leaning forward which I take as a sign<br>as I'm engaged I want to hear more I<br>want to be a bit closer on I want to<br>hear a little bit more good job with the<br>puppy dog we should ban those next time<br>because that's like the the nuclear<br>weapon of gaining attention great I feel<br>like I've just been to the theater it<br>was just a wonderful performance it was<br>engaging it had that it had that hook at<br>the start that then you were wrapped up<br>at the end again in terms of the<br>research again you've got within that<br>watts and the actual numbers of studies<br>participants how you'd focus down and I<br>think I even got insights of how you<br>might then use those are aha clinicians<br>to help train others and transfer that<br>knowledge further so wonderful wonderful</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
