November 2018, Phil Williams from Centrality spoke about an open ecosystem where companies can innovate and cities play a guiding role for the benefit of all their citizens.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

right<br>here we are lucky to have Phil Williams<br>today well not taking a rich long<br>introduction Phil is an expert on<br>blockchain and the plan is Phil will<br>talk about about blockchain and other<br>solutions they are providing at<br>centrally from 5:30 to 6:15 and then we<br>will open the floor for Q&amp;A and then<br>after that we'll see how it goes<br>thank you welcome thank you actually<br>yummy sinked remedy does a lot of things<br>a lot of things very wide range of<br>things and mobility<br>is is one of them and tonight because<br>there what is defining how we are<br>approaching at this problem putting it<br>the womb is it's skinny it's a pretty<br>crowded place and it's getting even more<br>crowded and one of the reasons we<br>created blockchain and decentralized<br>technologies is that as the world is<br>more crowded than a - epoch sharing<br>becomes vastly more important the<br>question do I believe that business like<br>this is here or something or do I<br>believe that we all have a project that<br>we attributed that's wrong and it's a<br>bit of a cosmic way to start a business<br>tool well we are a little bit like that<br>we do believe that the technologies we<br>use will make a huge difference to the<br>way we succeed project mobility is a<br>massive global market and it is serving<br>a crucial role in society and economy<br>and you're probably not thinking about<br>it day to day<br>this you driving up the southern<br>motorway in which case you're thinking<br>about it a lot particularly as you're<br>stuck in there's a big traffic jam it's<br>there every day but the private look at<br>it it has an incredible growth industry<br>and it's one of the greatest of<br>insurances the thing that probably<br>defined the technology that define the<br>20th<br>but it changed experiences we can have a<br>change to the jobs that we didn't have<br>changed how we designed that citizen<br>countries it's also a pretty selfish<br>technology it's got amazing comfort<br>inconvenience but that comfort and<br>convenience in terms of the jobs to be<br>done they've covered everything to me it<br>ate all of the demand private transport<br>trips from about 90 that the odd words<br>you don't need to be a transport<br>economist or even this is just and then<br>you just need to gather with pay<br>and there's a cost to a communities of<br>course it it's extinct the distance we<br>know procedures so we build wider cities<br>to suit the community to this<br>integration and some of that community<br>connections and people are is happening<br>because of the cap there also have had a<br>lot more opportunity a lot of wealth so<br>all these notes balance so we talk about<br>the feature of mobility the spoiler here<br>is the car isn't going anywhere it is<br>here the state about how we manage it<br>and the roles and the other parts of the<br>system they have to play our what is<br>really interesting and we have to change<br>the way that we approach mobility<br>because we can all be aware that cities<br>researcher so what do we actually want<br>from our future well if you ask people<br>they would tell you know what these<br>things they want options that are kinda<br>traceable we need that task we need it<br>they want equitable assistance that<br>would lower use of resources roads being<br>one and they are not a fee because there<br>are infrastructure that's not and what<br>the time they wanted to be getting back<br>to them because conditions and we want<br>health throughout people in essence in<br>their environment so he'll break this<br>into three sections and we're going to<br>talk about a bunch of the forces here<br>and micro mobility there's one that you<br>got and surfing around the streets<br>recently it's it's gonna impact our the<br>way we moved in six we're going to talk<br>about autonomy and Emily to application<br>I'm not going to talk about it for a<br>long time because cars and you probably<br>absorbed a lot of the data on it as well<br>so I'll touch in digital infrastructure<br>in mass and this is we're what we're<br>doing really comes into play in it's the<br>part that I'm personally passionate<br>about when we interview can make the<br>biggest difference at the lowest cost<br>for the most people couple things we<br>want to cover on a virtual much better<br>public transport which might be weird<br>but there's a whole realm than an of<br>itself it's fantastic we need to create<br>the public test but we should all do<br>more than just take that as a given and<br>if you think I'm ignoring it just know<br>how much you chip in micromotor link<br>starting here so what is it<br>it's it's not just those Alliance<br>scooters that you see<br>crashing into people on the sidewalks of<br>Queen Street it's nearly transport<br>they have vehicles under 500 penis in<br>that include scents like candy beads and<br>cats we're not going to talk about those<br>much because they are a little bit of a<br>weird one and they will have a role play<br>that I'm to let you get out of the lanes<br>of traffic they're not gonna make it I'm<br>a good girl<br>we make big change as students are<br>pretty awesome and they've got a having<br>an interesting economic impact<br>there's probably that that fastest<br>infected second the data sees that it is<br>that fastest-growing mobility business<br>even in the history of transportation<br>what they do is they grant short across<br>the sea agents that used to go to the<br>cars test in particular and they extend<br>the range of all engines so they<br>actually induce demand for instance is<br>that a lot of stay connected bracelet in<br>Christmas star and that as well but the<br>big dog in them actually sixty pieces of<br>the microphone or the Revolutionists the<br>ebike and they are going to be the real<br>Game Capture<br>once and it's the fastest way to get<br>across town actually statistically you<br>can pack it anyway in a retention time<br>building bridge into the 5:30 to come in<br>from but that's weird so you can steer<br>and microphone Billy isn't super<br>all-time Ginny's has do<br>fantastic job that is the so general<br>purpose they get us there any conditions<br>but we'll talk about some of those<br>cadets it's really today so that's the<br>proposition and there are three factors<br>that we need to think about we try and<br>analyze what actual impact my<br>credibility will have there the obvious<br>ones at a distance in the job we want my<br>try to do the speed at the time it's<br>going to take in the cost and a quick<br>nod to Horace unions Bruce Goodweather<br>living podcast the standard is great<br>apparently and starting with the<br>distance and the this is you east out of<br>a private car trips and poverty is<br>pretty hard to read but when we look at<br>at all of the data for travel for<br>private readily it invariably conforms<br>to the log normal distribution and it's<br>not surprising at all we all spend more<br>time going down to the supermarket that<br>we do driving further to Wellington so<br>meaning of the can as we take it could<br>be taken on the economy bike in fact<br>about half of them and Horace life's<br>break it down into 15 mile map I pull it<br>up that little bit and said that they<br>pay is probably a more realistic target<br>range but about half of these trips that<br>people take this is a big big thing you<br>start seeing around there that map so<br>you can see that the distance vector<br>once you get on the bike as if it's not<br>going to be energy and if we look at<br>other modes like they obviously mention<br>in the Enbridge and subway mass<br>transport<br>and us in UK data the median is with a<br>regular blacking range so put another<br>way any of those notes if you chop it<br>all down the middle that still comes<br>within the range of a standard bike let<br>alone at an e-bike so distance it's not<br>going to be the issue<br>speak speak comparison so some great<br>data from New York where they've got a<br>ton of information about how fast things<br>move on an urban services this is the<br>question can I get there at the time<br>that's workable and that's one of the<br>two big things that has been yelling<br>they're stopping people from getting<br>applies at the local New York City Taxi<br>on a two mile trip moves<br>vii long as it it's slow as and if<br>you've tried to take a taxi from<br>Shortland Street to the viaduct at five<br>o'clock you've had a similar experience<br>probably slowed a New York City bike<br>just a push by it because there's in<br>km/h a anybody can go to be kilometers<br>now but let's just say for a second that<br>you can keep 20 if you hit some lands so<br>in digital environments no surprise at<br>all that likes of acetic acid and just<br>taking those two distance and time<br>things and putting them together in our<br>local context we can start to see how<br>much of Auckland there's open that way<br>to start without the literate buyers<br>that's what the equation looks like the<br>dotted line is out at 20 kilometer trail<br>map that's an hour each way at you a lot<br>of people who are you'd write that and<br>more importantly than 10 kilometers line<br>the errors of is a billion in each way<br>which is a no-brainer so if you're on an<br>e-bike you can get here<br>half an hour and that would rely on us<br>having more lanes to do them in our<br>context and this is a challenge for the<br>city throughout the world is how much<br>should they take away what what should<br>they change in terms of the service<br>usage to get people to these modes we're<br>not doing that is grand plans that<br>Michael point they've done with the vpat<br>to consistently improve their so the<br>last one if we're gonna get people<br>switching on to mobility is is it going<br>to be cheap app and the answer is well<br>absolutely it is<br>the graph here shows pictures of<br>services in Peoria so this is my private<br>cost of ownership staff will their week<br>interfere and the first one of texting<br>cost 12 bucks on a shared knowledge<br>lands of dollars on any bike it's three<br>dollars in it's very important for<br>private vehicles there being a<br>competition for a cap in seats in the<br>market you know so I guess it's great<br>we've got these we've got these new<br>tools we've got the option that people<br>use that we can plan for them by now we<br>can get market driving this in the<br>answer it's East because the market is<br>so big if we look at the really new back<br>its associated with revenues beginning<br>these are Horace's big numbers and he's<br>being quite optimistic he's saying that<br>below 15 15 marks is 1.4 trillion then<br>it's right on but Mike remote<br>can address all of those rights so let's<br>just have it and say that we you know<br>that that's trips that down at the brain<br>or ignite or other places and you know<br>we we still have over 500 billion on<br>that but we can have it in insane well<br>actually this whole geographies that are<br>cities that are really hot in the summer<br>or coveted snow in the winter<br>and we still have 300 so just a sheer<br>numbers being that this is going to be<br>beckoned so a little bit of a summary<br>for the section cost per mile is low<br>it's going to be lower it's going to the<br>floor and that is huge it's getting he's<br>a bunch of the dollars that we will<br>speak as we speak a lot of the pleasure<br>to fight solves the two biggest barriers<br>which is for the betterment speak and it<br>autonomy in electric passion this is our<br>second thing these two courses bundle<br>together in they are kind of acting<br>attend at the moment with cards now you<br>neighbor this is the service car world<br>that we have these are going to be the<br>two big things so the electrification<br>and can help decarbonize entrance when<br>in autonomy does a ton of things segment<br>roads and give us their time there but<br>and there is a bit of a back here there<br>will be big down sights to these<br>technologies particularly a lot of<br>downsides provided we may carry<br>electricity with wind solar car but if<br>there are did not managed these two<br>courses we make what Thomas image of<br>people's could make life in our city<br>very very difficult and to describe that<br>of the live I'm going to play a short<br>video from a curious man will Robin<br>chase who's the CEO of Zipcar<br>and she sends us out so well I just do<br>it so hopefully this will play with<br>Artie this is where we really should<br>self-driving cars could make cities more<br>livable sustainable equitable and just<br>fully automated self-driving cars will<br>be available for seven cities by 2020<br>they have very different economics than<br>our current cars and so won't fit in<br>well with today's rules that play I see<br>two distinct possibilities for our<br>automated car future heaven or hell we<br>get to choose forward-thinking<br>leadership is going to make all the<br>difference we can help by taking a week<br>and see approach in this future people<br>buy 80s instead of today's cars for<br>trips once you get your destination<br>instead of paying for parking downtown<br>it will be cheaper to have your empty<br>APD's circle the block or drive back<br>home the same is true for stores it<br>could be cheaper to have a drugstore car<br>drive to customers that to pay for<br>retail space downtown today seventy five<br>percent of all cars on the road have one<br>occupant of the driver in the future as<br>we have more cars operating with their<br>different economics 50% the cars will<br>have no people in them running low value<br>errands or avoiding parking meanwhile<br>all the taxi bus show and truck drivers<br>who lose their jobs will also lose about<br>60 percent of our tax revenue that<br>finances road infrastructure because 80s<br>are electric don't park and don't get<br>parking tickets our roads and bridges<br>get a whole lot worse we definitely<br>don't want the health scenario we get<br>heaven by taking a proactive approach<br>but four million people newest cities<br>are already car sharing and in San<br>Francisco 15 percent of people using<br>ride hailing apps now share their trips<br>with another passenger who's a stranger<br>instead spending nine thousand dollars a<br>year on your own car when we combined<br>car sharing and<br>they'll invite seeds in a shared<br>autonomous vehicle we can get<br>door-to-door transport and the speed at<br>private car travel for the cost of a<br>subway ticket this transforms people's<br>access to opportunity cost rate<br>eliminates the need for parking who<br>write sharing reduces congestion we will<br>only need 10% of the cards we have the<br>six today even at peak times no more on<br>street parking no more parking garages<br>if most of the 80s and cities are shared<br>car distinguish people considered trips<br>we could I'm gonna cut her off their<br>risk the videos is great but with the<br>Nokia saying that this is all thinking<br>about pista literally this is not not<br>the fact that we move Frank is actually<br>going to be its own beast in autonomy<br>and electrification I had an easier time<br>they've mapped that for many reasons<br>because the the person that is not at<br>the center of the equation so what are<br>then and then summary from Robin there<br>that the 2020 feather she talks about<br>needs a little bit of expansion so<br>useful but the more important question<br>is when are we going to feel the main<br>impact from that and the answer comes<br>from a couple of different divorces<br>which are described here the<br>electrification so defense really is<br>dependent on battery for us the current<br>price of a Tesla Model 3 battery is<br>about $190 per kilowatt hour and it<br>needs to get down into that blue band<br>it's kind of hundred and seventy five<br>hundred and sixty dollar range for it to<br>be cheaper than a picker power at<br>construction and so that's going to<br>happen by about 20-25 in the end of<br>course it's going to take a little bit<br>of time for that market so you've got<br>our friends of JP Morgan there have said<br>that most new sales would be<br>and at same time you've gotten support<br>on me coming along or turned a is a<br>little easier because it relies mostly<br>on software and a lot of the technology<br>that we have to provide the economy has<br>is actually not hard tip it's<br>combinations of existing team that are<br>being bundled together so that's not a<br>hard rate limit it not like but not like<br>actually density is so we're going to<br>get autonomy particularly in this is a<br>pure research saying they have they pop<br>everyone who's working feel them out<br>every officer okay<br>Everage it is 27 so begin we're talking<br>about this 23 time for when we really<br>are going to see the bigger necks from<br>these these two trends so again talking<br>about private vehicles everyone's<br>they'll want in autonomous electric car<br>because it solves all of your personal<br>personal problems with the existing<br>infrastructure without asking you to<br>change your behavior all this there<br>might cost being a date we'd like to<br>think there's only one of them but there<br>are in fact there's a little bit of my<br>costume and all of us we all like to<br>jump in our car convenient time and it<br>doesn't just come down to pay attention<br>and budget article so we have to think<br>about the how you can automate this<br>because they've got these very big<br>engines that are set up to produce and<br>sell the cars are to individuals while<br>there are big plants in the matter<br>they're starting to emerge what we ever<br>do that we've got a number of other are<br>you having pictures with right here<br>attempt no time so individuals are<br>really not really get up the freedom of<br>the private cat and in our political<br>systems are not greater than the imagine<br>a planet it's hard to pass great policy<br>really when you don't have a whole lot<br>of data it was still hearing<br>it's about how to use roads and that's<br>something we need to improve<br>dramatically<br>so we need to set up after this<br>she went vision that works for cities<br>without skipping too hard on private<br>rights so zooming out a little there's<br>two big problems in a couple of issues<br>which we want to sort of dig in a little<br>bit and see how these people would be<br>affected or can't beat them so when<br>we're talking about dealing with send<br>them off you can see at the moment we we<br>deal with their muscle traits and we<br>also deal them with it privately with<br>teachers and with cycling pimps and we<br>use congestion pricing but legacy<br>condition prices are very very blunt and<br>both of these problems could be made<br>worse by otani begin because their<br>behavior you're not necessarily gonna<br>get a benefit to either please so<br>solution inside<br>cheering and pulling maybe these souls<br>occupancy is cause for optimism and this<br>is a trap which was published in the<br>promise it's from Morgan Stanley saying<br>that by 2030 around the sixties in about<br>places going to be total one Road police<br>is going to be sheer equals now that's a<br>good start<br>it really needs to be fugitive which is<br>and because we live in that society<br>Sharon needs to be cheaper more<br>convenient than running a vehicle to do<br>the area for it to really get down and<br>is a down side view which is that<br>convenience is is negatively impacted by<br>private tripping any additional crepin<br>that hearing clearance in New York is<br>experienced in this rundown that just<br>put a cap on the number of looters but<br>late in the game but they've already<br>written that this has been a measurable<br>slowdown and it has specifically do this<br>crazy number like a hundred thousand or<br>operating in New York City at the moment<br>if we want Jim to work we need to<br>prioritize Road space for shear and pull<br>vehicles at the moment you know before<br>the - see vehicle lanes it's one<br>solution the bad news is the data shows<br>that they don't work they are great if<br>you already were getting into a car with<br>your significant other or you were<br>written from round the corner because<br>you wanted to serve you get there faster<br>but they go in actually pull anyone get<br>anyone to go around knock on the door<br>and say hey you know I'd like to go and<br>get there faster they don't change<br>behavior so the good news though is that<br>sheep bleats and Portland can go and a<br>hint because that how you giver<br>behaviorally you're much more likely to<br>accept a pulled right into sharing of<br>care of Australia that that's not your<br>car at first place and that makes sense<br>right like if you've ordered an uber<br>pool or lyft line or one of these other<br>decision without a driver and Bruce is<br>handsome and where the stretcher and<br>that psychological changed it's crucial<br>in us the biggest reason why we should<br>start altering our infrastructure<br>referencing infrastructure to support<br>our shared passive response and we need<br>to ensure that shared vehicles actually<br>do call and we were there we need<br>digital infrastructure looking at the<br>second issue pricing better pricing as<br>the best solution for smoothing Peaks<br>pricing in centers and see most people<br>are here the conversation about whether<br>they can be flexible that their work<br>time will change travel plans and it<br>needs to account for these things here<br>some super easy like the time of the<br>trailer some at least easy local road<br>conditions of what's actually happening<br>on the ground at the moment and this is<br>summit cities are really interested in<br>and it sounds quite simple you know how<br>you've got red lines on Google right so<br>it must be kind of easy but it's<br>actually really had its really really<br>deadly intensive and we don't get the<br>assistance to make to take action<br>backstory and the last one is occupancy<br>like how do you price up<br>that's to have you told to two or three<br>people in a car have you told Carol sent<br>driver more than what my book people on<br>it<br>that's impossible currently but we can<br>do it with a digital and while this is a<br>really hard problem it's also a big<br>opportunity because cities in societies<br>don't solve our problems unless they've<br>got a real pointy stick that is calling<br>them and with my pointy stickers we've<br>got to lose all that fuel revenue or<br>like text written by about 2040<br>so yeah there's going to have to be some<br>inflation<br>nothing like losing a ton of text month<br>that will get politicians off it excites<br>and you know get you something together<br>see it it's gotta be a digital solution<br>so bit of a summary if we do not think<br>we probably eat Robyn's house scenario<br>that we pretty descent because they<br>would get all that straight spend eight<br>to ten minutes past it's not cool and if<br>we do these things by the by 2030 we<br>have a good shot<br>now the scenario and it really will end<br>its on the digital infrastructure pits<br>so which leads to the last segment here<br>and if you know particular Colby it I<br>think it's the last time there were<br>shell outside quickly take them to take<br>this take a shot at the ticket but over<br>that so you can write it down digital of<br>destruction so what we're talking about<br>we say there and these are the systems<br>we need to create energy out of changing<br>for the living environment<br>mobility is a services the concept that<br>rather than opening house will be able<br>to purchase a subscription based on<br>ability needs and that that dream of the<br>need to we need transporters services<br>it's pretty cool like you live in dealer<br>port you want to get to work but at the<br>top of the point street won't let you<br>choose we need to go and a shield power<br>comes around next you out diversity<br>theory but the same ticket if you walk<br>onto the theory and while you're on<br>appearing the clouds park this is four<br>seasons in one day and this is was gonna<br>hit power go together but still this is<br>actually do you like to swap it out with<br>scooter right in the second cell mm<br>circles<br>geez that option so into equal it's<br>endless journey on multiple votes and<br>you might get a subscription for that<br>well we're going to talk about me most<br>is the digital infrastructure so we get<br>that right in that actually is what<br>enables those mobility solutions of very<br>hard to search together without digital<br>so any of you who have worked<br>commercially in or studied the<br>technology industry said of any sort<br>knowing that that that market iterated<br>systems attack if we rely on existing<br>matter plans and mobility to write<br>software the talk to each other and take<br>a hands-off approach and just say hey<br>you know this substandards over there<br>you'll need to elaborate and share data<br>it doesn't work it's what works really<br>really badly it's it's slow its<br>lovely defeats with the same setting of<br>government and if ever you needed a<br>example of a bad hitter end market data<br>it's in the health care which in the<br>u.s. is a total crisis and New Zealand<br>even getting the possible that's<br>terrible so if we think it's going to<br>work mobility we're mistaken in a<br>federated man theoretic approach privacy<br>is a major major concern here at data<br>silos everywhere there were multiple<br>copies of individual states<br>with Newberry federated provider so this<br>the possibility that breaches is huge<br>one of the other features reminded that<br>with us the private monopolies scenario<br>this is what Google wants to be there<br>have been quite open about the fact that<br>they would like to disband a lot your<br>public transport and you know Dara is<br>going to give you your you're entering<br>smooth trip that I just described and<br>when they're wonderful they've even gone<br>and around some newest towns that<br>started as pilots who they said hey we<br>just closed down UMass system<br>guys seriously we've got this regardless<br>we just seemed out humans assume we'll<br>set up shop and so they don't plant<br>that's why they're that the Bourbon<br>that's very badly it's getting it really<br>nailing privacy is concerning at this<br>one in a different way there might be<br>more secure ironically in one central<br>place at least do the security<br>consultants will be great she'll<br>everybody paid but we all go to another<br>right now we're kind of on track from<br>the data in digital infrastructure<br>duration for shady Hydra participants to<br>I would say there will be the most<br>likely current policy Sears but there is<br>a good option that we should enable and<br>it's an open network open system that<br>respects regulation it's not run by<br>governments because they and it needs to<br>be statins by government and<br>particularly by since who have the most<br>to gain and the biggest problems or so<br>he would as shared and Heather's is<br>going to be a game changer for us so<br>thankfully we had centrality and not<br>alone and thus thinking very smart woman<br>up here deliverance<br>she is very very influential transported<br>from our lane and you've read them so I<br>won't repeat them but basically she's<br>saying hey we've got to do this on a on<br>a specter of digital we can't do that<br>the speaker concrete and she also<br>believes that we need a Linux operating<br>system that city viability she wants to<br>see you know having cities around the<br>world using the kind of local people<br>that we oppose it and to toward really<br>learn from each other's experiences and<br>been at that and that's a great vision<br>because news flash<br>since broke a lot of cities that really<br>really broke as a not too many is<br>somewhere in the middle most US cities<br>right stomach bankrupt Europe's in much<br>better shape if you've got a good money<br>to speak the name you've got your a<br>performance like China in Singapore who<br>in Dubai UAE UAE you can speak what they<br>like but generally if you want to if you<br>want a big solution and you want them to<br>be so<br>another issue with federated eyelets is<br>that the private market is huge in print<br>meanest mobility citizens and it's for<br>everyone that's not blue though<br>base there are 52 different mobility<br>hats and you can store it to one end<br>competition is good and that's not the<br>right kind of competition the kind of<br>competition you want is where you<br>compete on price on service on a good<br>quality not on just sneak with<br>acquisition by building that's actually<br>everyone doing the same we've ever ever<br>again and you can't easily get together<br>from our services you've got to go<br>around stitching up individual deals<br>which you know leads to so what does<br>this mythical open mobility look like<br>it's a little bit like this is two<br>pieces of software that primarily that<br>we absolutely have had to create this<br>kind of this kind of system one is<br>mobility happen that takes all of the<br>immediate employment setting whether<br>that's public transport or private<br>private mobility operates in a Mitri<br>private cats and they all at Easton to<br>this city hub in the event they're<br>available full custody availability in<br>there and they can be be pulled together<br>into a service by an application layer<br>and so the second the second piece focus<br>will start with we're doing is<br>there's a white label app and that's<br>like a super uber app that actually<br>takes all of the mobile transporter it's<br>not actually a really good multimodal<br>front-end application out there and<br>immaculate low unfortunately but we<br>built one in a system like that there's<br>a history open source so cities who have<br>their own transit at the moment maybe at<br>the ATM on your phone Portland can pick<br>it up Los Angeles to pick it up and they<br>can just just take it and rebranded and<br>those services could be offered through<br>yes with any good tip marketplace<br>because the the top layer the add layer<br>is open source this competition and<br>that's competing and the anthem serves<br>it with all that duplication so what do<br>we get out of what we get that that the<br>ability to create those engines power<br>theory experiment and we can offer<br>citizens rewards but walking cycling<br>public transport because we one of the<br>semis we can also connect private<br>vehicles who want to Kapil so there's a<br>really interesting product that weighs<br>heavily much to the u.s. now which is<br>ways it was rigid in a way to finding it<br>it was quite a little bit that we're<br>doing quite fine here but we need now<br>put your car journey in<br>it knows where you're going and then if<br>other ways users are on there and say I<br>wanna go from A to B it kind of turns<br>you into a digger so do you want to cap<br>off along with the stream and it's<br>crucial to do is one system here for<br>both<br>not-not-not practices but commercial<br>individual services and the private<br>Colorado and the reason for that is that<br>roads are meet with and networks only we<br>work very well in that water<br>it's a few a few mentors about that but<br>that would be a little a little<br>overbearing and so I want to try Cody to<br>get broadband for an open system we do<br>however need to address individual<br>privacy because when people see a chat<br>that says hey you know we're going to<br>add my taxi broadcasting into a city hub<br>it's it's very sensitive and there are a<br>lot of reasons why I might so what we<br>need to do in one of the really cool<br>things that blockchain can do is we can<br>start to do service over identity and<br>what that means is for any individual<br>who is operating in this crisis know<br>that is driving a taxi or running<br>private vehicle that they have their own<br>by the year so we northern city was very<br>much since that's the one uses ones I've<br>been optionally active in a distributed<br>cloud with an encrypted key there's not<br>a single different<br>it most importantly it doesn't seem data<br>so at the moment an API asks if you were<br>asking a traditional API you know for<br>copying someone's data it like that<br>driver's license number whatever that<br>seemed you that number at you they can<br>kick it back against it so you get that<br>piece of data use<br>they're drunks like them and then you go<br>off to the LPN capi even say hey is that<br>balance now all of a sudden you've got a<br>copy of that data and it's just a way<br>around that we have to have it if you<br>want to if you want to call it a food<br>patio go chicken what this kind of<br>decentralized setup allows is you can<br>ask questions so you've got some<br>information over point a and then you<br>actually say hey does this person have<br>of balance of current driver's license<br>announcer perspective one of the one of<br>the examples you use is its entry to a<br>bar is it's the class appointment you<br>have to prove your age but your ID is a<br>ton of other information and you know<br>the bouncer doesn't necessarily need to<br>see all that just needs to note with you<br>I'd write them together and this is the<br>digital so this spats become quite<br>crucial in mobility assistance because<br>systems like this need a lot of bruises<br>to operate you know that's the kind of<br>registration those are the driving the<br>cab does the driver have a license there<br>are quite a few things that they do need<br>to understand<br>so they centralized identities can help<br>be that they can be great solutions<br>those concerns about privacy with with<br>it's a lot of time so you have US Open<br>Mobile in any way in your city period<br>with the decentralized private ID and<br>what that can do is snap to return value<br>to the city in its citizens so if<br>mobility down is mind say the approval<br>times day I they should get a denote the<br>moment that returns and even more simply<br>cities just need to have access to fear<br>doubt that money within the minutes on a<br>rubber in order to improve services to<br>keep it at the moment that the havior of<br>the monopoly operates and mobility it's<br>summarize that and optimize data that<br>cities can use to make good decisions<br>open source so you want software that<br>doesn't belong over here to cities and<br>nations they can support the staff and<br>they skip the rules this is with cities<br>you know around sense and a<br>decentralized market runs the network<br>in an open market allows trusts or spot<br>contracts you can sell your customers<br>arrive in receive Commission without a<br>passion so this enables some interesting<br>new use cases you could bundle trim<br>functionality can be ubiquitous we pass<br>or if I made a risk associated contracts<br>offloading demand this is a big one for<br>mobility operators to work with each<br>other and at the moment if the weight on<br>your food service is slowly and tap so<br>it's not able get to you that's the only<br>empty here when you're finally today but<br>customers don't really care too much<br>about Brandis decisions the most part<br>and so another marketplace ability my<br>place one provider and on salary that<br>demand to another provider a received a<br>commission that came without any<br>training so there's a properly open<br>market and maybe that's fifty cents per<br>dollar so the the acquiring business is<br>wouldn't the brain would that they've<br>done that the royalty that that<br>established like in the end point of the<br>users phone but they'd be in delivery<br>they have been a little bit profits<br>between the in lastly usage fees and<br>based on cowboy this is a Holy Grail you<br>can actually come in through her with<br>privacy whether a sheared product hours<br>carrying more than one in charge when<br>you say this to transport planners<br>they're like the mines because then is<br>exactly what they want to do essentially<br>they're like in at the moment they do<br>that by putting everyone in the bus<br>because they know that their carries a<br>and we can do all that without so I<br>wrote it for New Zealand I won't talk<br>through through all the skin that<br>there's a couple of key things we've got<br>this we've got a pretty limited time and<br>there are kind of three phases we go<br>through and the first one is we've got<br>to start setting up for our digital<br>infrastructure so we need to start<br>piloting these open source city maps<br>where is she talking<br>I'm off to Portland tonight to talk to<br>them about whether they going to be<br>pilots in 2019 for the technology that<br>we're developing and then once you've<br>got a bit of their commercial traffic<br>and you start using those data sets to<br>inform policy we know that our student<br>leaders one day that helps leverage them<br>on their seats so that central<br>government and so once you've got some<br>of their digital infrastructure a place<br>you go into the middle zone here which<br>is we start getting the all the<br>commercial the for higher traffic a<br>testing through Hudson and you can even<br>start having movies in which epic pay<br>Road chapters and eventually you say all<br>new vehicle status and to some it's<br>really quite a way to go down the track<br>so the technologies proven out by that<br>point and it's only once you've gone 60<br>making this down the journey that you<br>actually start to deploy the step which<br>is we but we have to do something along<br>those lines anyway because we need and<br>we need to replace with it's just no way<br>around it so in tune in Wireless will<br>work is that nemesis you can't own a car<br>it doesn't say hey we've all got to just<br>hit these sheer police running around<br>city and you can't stand by that it's<br>just gonna be part of a system it uses<br>so that's that's the guts of it we needs<br>checked our rules we need legislation<br>that preempts the autonomous electric<br>vehicle play we need to use price as a<br>mechanism to manage a single driver<br>private car condition say that three<br>times fast we need to drive behavior<br>change with shared services City<br>Planning is pathway to the supervisor<br>ability to service possibilities we need<br>to close past the city to private not<br>more crack into open war white plates<br>the micro mobility we need to ensure our<br>digital infrastructure there's open<br>source San Jose wishes challenge I<br>believe<br>I think it's fantastic absolutely in<br>favor traplines are just a city's life<br>life and the kind of so what rational<br>line bus lines into super bus once<br>they're super fast<br>I mean it is actually serving people<br>under the bus lines because what people<br>hate about transfers of learners that<br>they get the weights so that means<br>faster even when a high frequency rap be<br>wearing will definitely fight forty<br>minutes at their timers have two minutes<br>because it's a super wine or something<br>I love to so there will always be I<br>think there'll be roles for a other kind<br>of non-standard on ground transportation<br>but the bulk of us are going to continue<br>to move on roads or something little<br>slow rate spreads of routes I love<br>talking about flying cars because they<br>do make me laugh<br>they're like the the galleons of old<br>they you have to have an extremely<br>wealthy patron in order to get to even<br>going basically they are going to be so<br>expensive and so in doing that we won't<br>even see them calendar and a huge uptake<br>sonic boom tests over Kansas City you<br>just this great podcast I like just just<br>just google it then you give me some<br>insight into the little pushback we'll<br>hear they're going to be an outsider you<br>go<br>privacy digits at this long change to<br>solid way my thoughts were like self so<br>great I didn t you could have multiple<br>entities or one more transporter and I<br>think for the driver and I agree for the<br>baby and possibly something others so<br>like you know how you solve that kind of<br>scenario so if I understand the question<br>correctly you're asking how will we<br>dealing with the identities of<br>everything and it would not just be yeah<br>I've been on reporting the past<br>remarried yeah great Italia is it's<br>already sold so they're in really tight<br>so I of entity within within the<br>sovereign identity sister people in the<br>nested any ecosystem that I used to be<br>so that you know essentially using the<br>transport should have all those enemies<br>well that would be serum meathead rule<br>there would be some databases that kind<br>of specific things that had a regulatory<br>or a system function but the cool thing<br>companies between because there's a<br>challenge or something yeah then like<br>working passengers they decide it was<br>about hospitably out of their life<br>yeah yeah I see what you're getting it<br>so there are some pretty pretty easily<br>easy to define parameters about how<br>willing and an occupant initiate vehicle<br>is to diverge on fear westering car<br>accelerates up in the all the day that<br>shows us that they are actually willing<br>to go quite a way out of their path<br>provided they give a turn around if they<br>start going back the behavior just<br>changes completely so you can get away<br>like it to be a but don't you feel like<br>if they're lies when just so many<br>political veterans that are probably<br>outside of your control but just imagine<br>that you said that there should be like<br>last ladies and like we should double<br>body gleams imagine if the government<br>proposes it and next day to open the<br>herald or stop and like they're<br>don't like what we see now is kind so<br>with government they kind of waking up<br>or just not doing anything<br>like when there are going in I totally<br>understand so you're you're right the to<br>achieve their vision that roadmap first<br>it up it means you know it would take a<br>really a lot of people and a lot of<br>energy and lot of states and sitting on<br>something we do but there's that vision<br>which I think it's a great goal for us<br>and then there is our project and the<br>actual the hub and the the open source<br>software that would build it and around<br>that hub can can succeed to a number of<br>bills and the Baffert's initiative<br>success is quite low what we need is the<br>support of cities to get it installed if<br>they put the public test<br>which they have no reason not to that<br>sense that we inspect with the<br>university support because they had one<br>purpose was something they want<br>multimodal monogramming to public<br>transport then everything else<br>everything else to do to the private<br>market we would still in a situation<br>where every other mobility provider<br>who's not uber or lyft would benefit<br>from being in that he would if you<br>already know pensively work he don't<br>benefit a lot from it<br>but what you find is you get the top<br>half of the market with a couple of<br>companies and then you'll announce and<br>then everyone else would educate super<br>well with PT so the time if certain<br>cities go and we're dealing with cities<br>with a range of views on that there's<br>some of them like center for our a<br>little more that free-market approach<br>we're not going to or give you our PT<br>potential trends in here but everything<br>I suffer you Portland a little different<br>extremely progressive transit authority<br>here the woman behind the cube who<br>writes their innovation has been in the<br>ten years originally didn't code about<br>the general transit vehicle<br>specification along they Portland have<br>already gone around and and they have<br>agreements with the major shipment of<br>advising the city saying hey you have to<br>put for you you will put your impinge<br>rate into an open-plan it's a piece of<br>software that they developed which is<br>just any<br>arousing piece of software doesn't send<br>them together that's got no contracts<br>between em so they will be able get a<br>beer ecosystem and while they say for us<br>is ok cool we've done it you you could<br>provide stock<br>- initiative something succeed just just<br>with a bison school in the city working<br>seeing the city's folks good and it<br>isn't Natalie which is an international<br>support of the approach which would only<br>come out of a couple of successful<br>pilots and cities in the name of these<br>a local question so what are you saying<br>is that in this case you are saying that<br>the participants can cooperate and then<br>they can compete as well so they have to<br>cooperate so you are saying this is a<br>better market compared to open free<br>market competition is that what you say<br>it's a it's a young competition there<br>would be instances in which I think<br>cities will will tell a line between<br>saying to providers is your entry in<br>there and you have to be party to the<br>other projects what that might say is<br>you just have to attest so that we give<br>you a mobility data but if you want to<br>run here with your own network that's<br>fine but in what you give is that the<br>first scenario that I described where<br>the PT and mentary in a city can even<br>really well with the small participants<br>who gain everything in any bigger<br>operators like that who wouldn't sign up<br>into this distance and what then is<br>going to mean that over time they'll be<br>benefit even to big operators so can<br>we've got a lot of X now these that I<br>was asking is there a follow-up question<br>is so I look at like you know again in<br>the market so for example you are<br>proposing an open digital market and<br>infrastructure actually where many<br>partners can for example join in right<br>so think of for example maybe Kevin here<br>is no difference mainframe they're not a<br>supply chain operators so you think<br>you're maybe developing infrastructure<br>for supply chain operators and so all<br>many people might join in the question<br>is whether they have benefit in joining<br>in certain infrastructure so you're<br>talking about sharing demand or<br>offloading the balance so other things<br>so whether such a system can be<br>developed for these different sectors as<br>well it's that's what oh sorry yeah yeah<br>yeah absolutely<br>and that freight logistics is quite a<br>different base to human logistics which<br>is why when I score keepers here are<br>keeping society day one with eventually<br>we're doing a little bit of working in<br>their area not a logistics near are a<br>couple of of open-minded places there is<br>a blockchain based solutions from it so<br>I think we will see will see there in<br>time it said it's it if the two even<br>became the same they might be surprised<br>that they have some fundamental<br>principles<br>you mean would it be worth having it<br>open<br>even without the last moment it could<br>still still work well because it could<br>provide possible that could provide a<br>better purchasing for routing and<br>purchasing solution than me city's<br>existing PTT<br>in fact the past pretty light on some of<br>those so the answer is yes I mean ATS<br>but here it's so nice in cities who are<br>an asset so even if they took the white<br>label rein in the hub and just put the<br>badge on it the public transit benefits<br>of public transport riders would be here<br>I think we might you've just reminded me<br>that we we all did this poll and I<br>haven't actually popped it up to see see<br>what we got because this hits some<br>connections now I'm gonna hit to jump<br>I think and I think he wheeze will find<br>will struggle with it in the first<br>instance and we're not Europeans yet<br>although we might aspire to let's have a<br>let's have a look down here what people<br>said about your question thank you about<br>carpooling 11 out of living people out<br>there and 60 60 books interview send you<br>happily share your cacnea with other<br>people so immediately this room might<br>have a bit of ask you but I'm heartened<br>by by veterans own just run through<br>these so that you can see what everyone<br>else answered and ebikes<br>most of you have never tried one in no<br>one owns one then this ban is a shame if<br>I'd answer there I've just ordered one<br>from Belgium and it's coming in after<br>Christmas it's called a cowboy and I'll<br>send you the link given they read dot<br>design will look amazing yeah fantastic<br>and regarding executors I have half of<br>you here to try one but nearly half if<br>have written one in tips in be own one<br>that's cool nice it's one person who is<br>they do what you don't have to be nice<br>okay yeah yeah yes so that's the one<br>that's that birdie news right here three<br>yeah that's good my relationship will do<br>better yeah not surprised at all no and<br>this may be used in most people only is<br>it yeah I gave a much briefer talk at<br>the NZ taxi Federation conference a<br>month or two ago and there was some sad<br>yeah we absolutely should and and we<br>actually have a product called you share<br>as well which is does it has been<br>designed specifically to digitize legacy<br>taxi fleets because so many of them<br>struggle with with the end user<br>experience thinking about electric cars<br>most it near a driven one and there are<br>a few year they live durin someone<br>else's me to a buddy of mine hesita<br>Silurians drove there a little bit in<br>one of you owns or a seriously<br>considering and lucky last the thinking<br>about autonomous cars and sharing and<br>while we talked about that didn't we<br>yeah we were
