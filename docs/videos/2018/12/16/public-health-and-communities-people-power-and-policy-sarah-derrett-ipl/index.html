he knew iki okoto Katsura Kira<br>koto Co Richard Blake otaku enjoy hey<br>Khomeini ha ha Safari wanna or Tago<br>Tenneco toad in our koto tena koutou<br>katoa a good evening everyone my name's<br>Richard Blakey I'm deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for research and enterprise<br>standing in for professor having hand<br>the Vice Chancellor tonight who is not<br>able to attend as she has just got back<br>from overseas and was not sure whether<br>the travel plans would get her here in<br>time she sends her apologies though it's<br>my great pleasure to introduce this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for<br>professor Sarah Durrett to you this<br>evening and really my job is to<br>introduce introduce not the speaker but<br>the rationale for having an orbital<br>professorial lecture give some overview<br>remarks and then lead on to Professor<br>Paul Brunton the pro vice-chancellor in<br>the division of humanities to introduce<br>Sarah to you firstly welcome to those<br>who have come in some cases from afar to<br>be here in particular to guests of Sarah<br>and understand your mother Allison your<br>sister Helen and your niece Jessica have<br>traveled from New Plymouth so welcome to<br>you and that your friend Sarah has come<br>from Christchurch so welcome in I hope<br>that your travel has been safe also your<br>husband Brian and some macaé have<br>travelled from Dunedin no actually from<br>Port charmers to get here tonight so<br>welcome to you and I trust that your<br>journeys back home either tonight or<br>later are safe acknowledge also the<br>pro-vice deputy vice-chancellors Pro<br>Vice Chancellors Dean's and heads of<br>departments we have here tonight<br>visitors from our local community<br>welcome and these are public lectures so<br>welcome and those of you who are here<br>from our academic community<br>welcome welcome and thrice welcome<br>inaugural professorial lectures are a<br>very important part in our academic<br>calendar particularly for those of us<br>with an administrative loads that mean<br>that we crave we crave we crave for the<br>opportunity<br>get and be intellectually stimulated in<br>our lives that are offered often and<br>overcome by administrivia at times<br>oh no I mean very important<br>administrative duties and email so as<br>much as anything we preserve and we<br>invest in inaugural professorial ich<br>lectures for our own benefit but of<br>course as well as to allow people who<br>have been appointed to this highest of<br>our academic titles to profess to their<br>colleagues and to members of the public<br>and becoming a professor at the<br>University of Otago is no mean feat that<br>either appointment from outside into a<br>into a name door open or vacant a chair<br>or in Sierra's case<br>promotion from within requires<br>candidates to have demonstrated<br>performance at the highest level across<br>teaching research and service the three<br>components that characterize the<br>academic life at the University of Otago<br>and that is identified with a four<br>letter acronyms Sol sieve sustained<br>outstanding leadership and competence<br>that has to be demonstrated in at least<br>two of those three attributes of<br>teaching research and service with mere<br>outstanding performance in in the third<br>of them it is not possible to be<br>appointed to a professor at this<br>university by being weak and trading off<br>high performance in one of our core<br>areas with poor performance in another<br>we value and see the value in supporting<br>teaching research and service at equal<br>status here in Sarah's case look that<br>and looking through and reviewing the<br>documentation that the vice-chancellor<br>head in front of her when she was<br>determining this promotion I can see<br>that it was a very very straightforward<br>case coming from a humanities background<br>through nursing to academia and practice<br>leading units such as the injury<br>prevention route unit leadership that is<br>highly focused leadership and services<br>as highly focused towards outcomes and<br>importantly equitable outcomes<br>for people and communities Sara's Sara's<br>performance is is right on the mark for<br>me personally it it hits a number of<br>attributes of identifying that we are<br>here not only to train the next<br>generation of practitioners members of<br>our communities and outstanding<br>researchers but through that work that<br>we do as much as possible lead to direct<br>benefits that for the people that we<br>support as well I note that sara has a<br>key leadership role in a new and<br>important initiative we have as the<br>Center for health systems and<br>technologies which is aimed to<br>strengthen and enhance our our<br>translational research profile by<br>looking at supporting New Zealand's<br>first health research strategy that has<br>key strategic goals of both creating a<br>vibrant research environment in the<br>health sector and building and<br>strengthening pathways for translating<br>research findings into policy and<br>practice and I have no doubt that we<br>will hear some of the work that sara has<br>been involved with it they're very<br>applied IND in her lecture tonight so<br>with that I did not have anything to do<br>with this promotion but I can see that<br>it is very very well deserved and that<br>it was a very straightforward decision<br>based on the materials that I've<br>reviewed for the vice-chancellor to<br>endorse that promotion so<br>congratulations<br>Sara and I now hand over to Professor<br>Paul Brunton the pro vice-chancellor in<br>the division of Health Sciences to give<br>you a more formal introduction<br>congratulations<br>thank you Richard kyaaa<br>tonight a toke out or my role tonight is<br>to tell you a little bit about Sarah and<br>to do that effectively I have obviously<br>looked at her CV today and I tell you I<br>could be here all night just summarizing<br>the CV because this is a very<br>accomplished colleague of ours here at<br>the University but the key points I<br>think to allude to are that Sarah<br>graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a<br>major of history from the University of<br>Otago in 1987 she then went on and<br>qualified in nursing from Otago<br>Polytechnic in 1990 and masters a<br>master's degree and PhD from the<br>University of Otago closely followed<br>thereafter Sarah's public health<br>research concentrates on health and<br>disability outcomes policy and equity<br>and Richard has already alluded to that<br>she was a heartless fellow from 2011 to<br>2012 at the University of Chicago<br>investigating healthcare integration in<br>rural safety net clinics and is an<br>international Europol group member<br>focused on the assessment of<br>health-related quality of life and with<br>all that she's deputy head of the<br>department of preventive and social<br>medicine where she's also director of<br>the injury prevention Research Unit as<br>such much as Sarah's research is focus<br>on outcomes for injured New Zealanders<br>for which she acknowledges Health<br>Research Council funding and I could go<br>on but I won't so at this point I invite<br>Sarah to come forward to give her<br>lecture entitled public health and<br>communities people power and policy<br>Sarah<br>you know Cotto Couture I'm just trying<br>to set my timer so I don't keep you here<br>one second longer than I I ought to<br>so beer with me okay ready to go glasses<br>so Thank You professor Blakely mr.<br>Blanton pro vice-chancellor Trish head<br>of department at tena koutou katoa<br>caldera Dorito I'd like to begin by<br>acknowledging the target of FINA WA for<br>the atotal for my research and career<br>and particularly the people from auto<br>kopaka Taraki and moeraki I'd also like<br>to acknowledge the Pro Vice Chancellors<br>Trish professor Sir David skeg who's<br>here in the audience past<br>vice-chancellor and also the person who<br>interviewed me and allowed me to begin<br>my masters in public health training<br>thank you very much for coming obviously<br>my family member that Allison's sister<br>Helen Jessica mkhaya Brian all of you<br>Syria thank you very much for for coming<br>and being here this evening you've all<br>you know been such wonderful supports to<br>me over the years and my car's partner<br>via litterin recent times cooking<br>fabulous meals and Leah Taylor thank you<br>so much for coming Leah who's been a<br>constant and loyal supporter of my<br>career and pathway for many years since<br>my days at the Mornington Methodist<br>Church so it's lovely to see you here<br>and everyone else is a bit of a treat<br>some cases I haven't seen in a long long<br>time and I'm very appreciative of you<br>being here thought my talks going to<br>begin with a brief introduction to my<br>family background and personal academic<br>pathway for your history and nursing to<br>my mph and PhD then I'm going to present<br>a widely-used F initiative public health<br>drawing on some examples from my own<br>public health research to outline how my<br>work and the work of my colleagues links<br>to the subtitle of my talk people power<br>and policy so this is the lady Nugent<br>and<br>cura father I hope the technology hasn't<br>let us down but my father can't be here<br>and I'm going to be talking about my<br>father's ancestors and my mother's<br>ancestors a bit so the lady Nugent<br>it's 1841 coming in on a rather choppy<br>sea to wellington harbour but on board<br>was an inn sister of my mother Sarah<br>stood Lee and Sarah had come out as a<br>young team from Devon on the lady Nugent<br>and she ended up marrying Joseph<br>McCleary who was a member of the 65th<br>English regiment he was illiterate<br>but paid for all six children to be<br>educated including the girls which was<br>an optional item in those days so the<br>man Sarah steadily married<br>Joseph was part of the 61st New York and<br>Lynch Lancaster regiment all the Hetty<br>perps as they were known in my mother's<br>family the migration began with Sarah<br>but it continued on mostly with people<br>coming out from Scotland until 1878 when<br>my great-grandfather Simon Moore came<br>out to New Zealand on his own leaving<br>his family at the ripe old age of<br>eighteen to set up a new life here in<br>New Zealand another branch of my<br>mother's family Thomas and Janet<br>Harrison emigrated to Port Chalmers on<br>the fourth migrant ship the Blundell<br>which brought settlers to found this<br>Presbyterian settlement here in Dunedin<br>the ship the blundell lifts London on<br>the 4th of May and arrived in Port trama<br>New Zealand on the 26th of September<br>1848 so a voyage of 148 days and I<br>reflect often on these ancestors and<br>what took them to these far-flung parts<br>the world and what their motivations<br>were I think often from what we<br>understand it was a situation of<br>deprivation and need so I know that<br>Simon more leaving Orkney lift and 9<br>acres of land that was supporting two<br>families including 21 children so he<br>really needed to go and find his own new<br>place in the world quite why he came<br>here and his brother went and settled in<br>Canada I don't know in<br>way so the Harrisons came in 1848 and in<br>fact I think I spotted Paul Henson here<br>Paul his ancestors who came on the<br>blundell as well and I'm here yeah I<br>don't think so I've looked into it Paul<br>but they sit sale with five daughters<br>under the age of 10 the Harrison's but<br>seven weeks before arriving at their<br>destination Janet gave birth to her<br>sixth daughter on the 31st of July off<br>the coast of Africa and I just can't<br>believe what that must have been like on<br>my father's side so my father can't be<br>here if it's a picture of my debt the<br>Richard and Mary Langman came out to New<br>Plymouth with three young sons and the<br>substance arriving on the Blenheim in<br>1842 Robert Langman was a miner and his<br>parents had both died and the cholera<br>epidemic of 1832 and it buried at the<br>lost wideo churchyard in Cornwall<br>he had a mail run into the funginner<br>region during the New Zealand Wars that<br>ended up owning a Red House Hotel a New<br>Plymouth and hitting a number of<br>children migration on both sides of the<br>family stopped in the late 1870s and my<br>moving to sort of more recent times my<br>early childhood was initially spent in<br>cents and then Martin then when I was<br>two I removed to the remote southern<br>King country where my father farmed five<br>thousand acres and where my sister and I<br>had an idyllic childhood really of horse<br>riding kayaking lots and lots of<br>beautiful forests and idyllic features<br>there were no shops whatsoever and the<br>nearest town was a little metropolis<br>called water er<br>where we went once every six weeks for<br>groceries my parents were highly<br>organised people the the mountain<br>Taranaki featured large in our lives<br>often what could or couldn't be done on<br>the farm was based on how visible it was<br>and I believe this is my first trip up<br>to see the snow we're with my mother who<br>was looking sensational and great specs<br>and<br>sister and my father was behind the<br>camera being before the days of selfies<br>so my schooling giving to contemporary<br>times was at Foley arena primary school<br>where my mother was the sole charge<br>principle of up to 33 pupils single<br>Hendra dredging from primary you know<br>new entrants through to form to students<br>and my mother's work ethic and<br>enthusiasm for education has his<br>inspires us all and definitely myself I<br>then went to high school in New Plymouth<br>and came to the University of Otago in<br>1982 to begin a degree in medicine that<br>I stopped rightly or wrongly towards the<br>end of the second year to complete a<br>degree in history and then I did my<br>nursing training at Otago Polytech and<br>had my first job in Lenore's Ward up at<br>the rehabilitation unit at rockery<br>Hospital and it was a fantastic job and<br>as as mentored by Juliet mening who is<br>an absolutely wonderful nurse and I I<br>didn't moved to work at Ashbourne Hall<br>it's now called Ashburn clinic I spent a<br>total of ten years nursing there<br>although I began my DPH training<br>throughout that time and I really think<br>that the research I do that's focused on<br>people's quality of life and outcomes<br>and experiences of health systems has<br>really inspired by my my nursing<br>training so I'm grateful to Lenoir and<br>Juliet and others for that so I'm going<br>to move on and touch on on what we mean<br>by public health so I know a lot of you<br>in the room know that what we mean very<br>very clearly but some of you don't I'm<br>Donna actions defined public health as<br>the art and science of preventing<br>disease and I always want to add the<br>word injury promoting health and<br>prolonging life through the organized<br>efforts of society in public health<br>we're interested in stopping our people<br>from becoming sick in the first place<br>for example through healthy environments<br>and waterways through safe roads and<br>workplaces or through vaccinations<br>campaigns to prevent measles or other<br>infectious diseases or improved alcohol<br>sale and purchase policies but when<br>people do experience illness or injury<br>public health in focuses on how to<br>contain the outbreak or lessen future<br>injuries and on how we can hasten the<br>recovery process by supporting people to<br>access the necessary health and social<br>services of course health professionals<br>working in the care of individual<br>patients in our health care system are<br>crucial to both the recovery process and<br>prolonging life as those of us who have<br>ever been ill be this through food<br>poisoning renal failure and I see Rob<br>sitting up there in the background a<br>cardiac or cancer diagnosis or injury<br>well no but key to public health as its<br>lengths to the health of populations and<br>by this we can thank countries regions<br>communities Public Health is not<br>primarily focused on the health of an<br>individual person in front of an<br>individual health professional at times<br>public health professionals and<br>researchers are very interested in the<br>health of specific individuals and I've<br>got here a map of John snows diagram<br>recording the deaths of the 1850s<br>cholera epidemics in London and making<br>the connection between affected<br>individuals in the wider reach of the<br>cholera epidemic and I just like to take<br>the liberty of reading a little piece<br>here<br>I'm written about the cholera epidemic<br>at the time if I can find the right page<br>so they're talking about Spitalfields a<br>dust-heap<br>and the heart of East East End a heap of<br>dung the size of a tolerably large house<br>in an artificial pond and to which the<br>contents of cesspits are thrown the<br>contents are allowed to desiccate in the<br>open air and they're frequently stirred<br>for that purpose Mayhew described this<br>grotesque scene and an article published<br>in the london morning Chronicle in 1849<br>that surveyed the Ground Zero of that<br>year's cholera outbreak within journeyed<br>on to London Street number one of the<br>streets the cholera first appeared 17<br>years ago so they're talking about the<br>the second large evident in spread up it<br>with fearful virulence but this year it<br>appeared at the opposite end and<br>dumb H with like severity as we passed<br>along the reeking banks of the sewer the<br>Sun shone upon a narrow slip of water in<br>the bright light it appeared the color<br>of strong green tea and positively<br>looked as solid as black marble in the<br>shadow indeed it was more like watery<br>mud than muddy water and yet we were<br>assured this was the only water the<br>Richard inhabitants had to drink as we<br>gazed in horror at it<br>we saw drains and sewers emptying their<br>filthy contents into it we saw a whole<br>tier of doorless privies in the open<br>road common to men and women built over<br>it we heard bucket after bucket of filth<br>splash into it and the lumps of the<br>vagrant boys bathing in it seemed by<br>pure force of contrast as white as<br>marble and yet as we saw stood doubting<br>the fearful statement we saw a little<br>child from one of the galleries opposite<br>lower a tin can with a rope to fill a<br>large bucket that stood beside her in<br>each of the balconies that hung over the<br>stream the self-same tub was to be seen<br>in which the inhabitants put the mucky<br>liquid to stand so that they may are may<br>after it has rested for a day or two<br>skim the fluid from the solid particles<br>of Filth and pollution and disease as<br>the little thing dangled her tin cup as<br>gently as possible into the stream a<br>bucket of knights or soil was poured<br>down from the next gallery and so we<br>have London in 18-49 and the great work<br>of John Snow and also Henry Whitehead<br>this is a very very good book if you've<br>not read it it's called the ghost map by<br>Steven Johnson provides a very good<br>history of the epidemic and John Snow<br>was able to describe the houses in which<br>the the deaths that occurred and Henry<br>Whitehead because he was a Presbyterian<br>minister was able to actually track down<br>the people who had survived the epidemic<br>and moved away and together they they<br>provided some of the solutions to the<br>solving of the cholera problem although<br>the story of the pumphandle at Broad<br>streets a bit apocryphal I believe so<br>so what besides health promotion illness<br>and injury prevention and hasty<br>hastening recovery can we identify as<br>characteristics of public health<br>practice and academia the key is<br>included in HSN's definition it is<br>public health focused on the organized<br>efforts of society that make the<br>difference in public health we're<br>interested in bigger shows we're<br>interested in improvements in the health<br>of our populations through action and<br>collective change we're interested in<br>influencing upstream the social policy<br>system sources to reduce the number of<br>people affected downstream and using the<br>cholera epidemic thinking about how the<br>knowledge about the behaviors and deaths<br>of individuals can be used to take<br>upstream action for improved drinking<br>water quality thereby preventing the<br>deaths of thousands while in public<br>health research we often learn from the<br>experiences of individuals experiencing<br>health problems injury disability racism<br>or poverty<br>we ain't turn that knowledge into<br>generating findings about how to prevent<br>adverse experiences and outcomes for<br>others and to improve the overall health<br>of our communities public health is at<br>heart deliberately inclusive of our<br>communities often indeed usually we have<br>people from our communities directly<br>involved in our research projects Public<br>Health focused on improving the health<br>of populations through collective social<br>action is necessarily multidisciplinary<br>this photo board represents just some of<br>my colleagues from preventive and social<br>medicine which is one of the largest<br>departments in the university with over<br>130 staff among my colleagues there are<br>people with particular expertise in<br>certain disciplines there are Maori<br>health researchers including the people<br>highlighted here from the Nyko hamari<br>Health Research Unit<br>there are epidemiologists bio<br>statisticians and data managers health<br>economists and Trudie looks all on her<br>own there but Trudy does a lot of work<br>with Paul who's sitting beside her from<br>the Department of Economics and other<br>biostatisticians<br>end with us and a lot of qualified<br>health professionals including a number<br>of doc<br>does aside from disciplinary expertise<br>there are also groups of people focused<br>on particular topics for example cancer<br>or those of us from our Injury<br>Prevention Research Unit who focused on<br>injury prevention and rehabilitation my<br>specific area of public health research<br>is known as Health Services Research and<br>this means that I focus on considering<br>how people access systems their process<br>through those systems social and<br>financial costs equity and outcomes are<br>across a range of populations illness<br>and injury types so my public health<br>research career began with a study of<br>people on surgical waiting lists for<br>elective as opposed to acute pepperoni<br>or prostate surgery supervised by<br>Professor Charlotte Paul dr. Jenny<br>Morris and statistically by Professor<br>Peter her Burson meanwhile a new<br>approach was introduced in the mid 90s<br>an approach that became known as the<br>booking system where people were<br>referred to specialists working in our<br>publicly funded hospitals for surgical<br>assessments and they were then scored<br>and then either granted or denied access<br>to surgery based on that summed score my<br>PhD focused on that I was supervised<br>tagged in by Charlotte and Peter and<br>professor Robin Gould who's who's here<br>with us tonight focused on understanding<br>that new booking system that research<br>found that people wanted those worse<br>than them to have access ahead of them<br>that is people tend to be reasonable<br>that people preferred to delay surgery<br>until it was really necessary that is<br>they were not all breaking down the<br>doors to access theater and to have<br>operations but when people really were<br>in need we needed a better approach to<br>fairly and equitably determine priority<br>I proposed an alternative alternative<br>approach where fiercely specialists<br>would determine whether or not surgery<br>is clinically warranted and then to<br>effectively prioritize access to surgery<br>according to people's own symptoms<br>because importantly we found that<br>people's own self-reported severity was<br>the best predictor of outcomes following<br>elective surgery not the clinic<br>priority assessment tools that were<br>being used unfortunately even within our<br>own well founded healthcare system<br>changes such as the booking system which<br>was a multi-million dollar investment to<br>genuinely try and address the identified<br>problems that existed with waiting lists<br>are often implemented without a robust<br>evaluation or without even a careful<br>consideration of perverse incentives<br>that could result from such a<br>large-scale system change the perverse<br>reality of the mid-1990s booking system<br>and the legacy of which we are left with<br>today is that each region throughout New<br>Zealand was incentivized to develop<br>their own scoring tools so we had no<br>national consistency the development was<br>doctor driven with little to no genuine<br>consultation with the people directly<br>affected and my research found that the<br>criteria that may be important for<br>clinicians deciding whether or not<br>surgery is necessary which is really<br>important we're not the best criteria<br>for prioritizing access if we're<br>interested and improved outcomes for<br>patients hence the recommendation that<br>elective surgery first should have<br>clinicians determining the clinical<br>necessity for that treatment but then<br>that prioritization should be according<br>to the severity experienced by patients<br>the other interesting finding from this<br>PhD work was the evident conflict of<br>interest encountered by patients and New<br>Zealand's two-tiered system whereby<br>elective surgeries provided both by the<br>state or publicly funded hospitals and<br>private hospitals although our publicly<br>funded system ranks well in terms of per<br>capita costs and although as you can see<br>from this orange bar 80% of our health<br>services are funded via the taxpayer we<br>do not rank well in terms of equity in<br>New Zealand we have a system with a<br>wealthy and privately insured connexes<br>treatment but with much lesser need for<br>treatment and more quickly than can be<br>provided in the publicly funded<br>healthcare system often the clinicians<br>working in New Zealand's private and<br>public health sectors are the very same<br>people and there's been no clear if it<br>made to manage the process of clinicians<br>working in both the private and public<br>sectors in New Zealand<br>with the likely conflict of interests<br>arising as a consequence indeed study<br>participants reported being told by<br>clinicians that they would never receive<br>surgery in the public sector but that<br>they could operate on them next week in<br>the private hospital even in cases where<br>their scoring clearly indicates that<br>they would have met the threshold for<br>funded surgery in the in the public<br>system sometimes in our communities<br>there's an argument that runs something<br>like this that it's better for us to<br>have a private healthcare system running<br>alongside our publicly funded tax payer<br>system because in the wealthy pay<br>privately for treatment there the in<br>freeing up capacity in the public system<br>for people who can't afford such private<br>treatment more recently we undertook<br>research to examine the relationship<br>between the provision of private surgery<br>and access to public treatment and we<br>found the opposite to be the case we<br>found wide variations and rates of<br>elective surgery throughout New Zealand<br>variations not able to be explained by<br>age or other demographic features and we<br>found that in regions where the private<br>surgery rates were the highest the<br>publicly funded rates were lower and<br>even for the poorest New Zealanders they<br>were most poorly served in the regions<br>where the provision of private surgery<br>was the highest the implication being<br>that in an unregulated private sector we<br>do not appear to have this does not<br>appear to have a positive effect on<br>equity of elective surgery provision<br>either geographically or for the most<br>socioeconomically deprived and the<br>argument that private provision for the<br>wealthy reduces the burden on the public<br>system and allows better access for the<br>poor is not supported the work of Jeff<br>Fisher building on her SH months work<br>and presented in his pockets at voice<br>and loyalty points to the importance of<br>maintaining the integrity of our<br>publicly funded health care system<br>though we need the voices of the<br>educated and wealthy to remain loyal to<br>our publicly funded health care system<br>to help advocate for improvements we do<br>not benefit by those people becoming<br>disenchanted with the public system in<br>exiting that system to go to the private<br>sector if they take with them their<br>loyalty and voices calling for<br>improvement there is mounting evidence<br>we are all rich and poor<br>like it is served by living in a country<br>that holds fast to the vision of a<br>universally accessible healthcare system<br>our desert health system was not<br>designed with important core principles<br>including universal accessibility into<br>equity and our system here in New<br>Zealand preceded that in England<br>England's in HEA a decade I'm very<br>hopeful that the review of the New<br>Zealand health and disability sector<br>that's now underway will identify<br>solutions to our workforce shortage and<br>the publicly funded health system and<br>also strategies to help address the<br>evident inequities resulting from an<br>unconstrained private sector so on<br>completion of my PhD I moved to the<br>center for health planning and<br>management at Keele University so<br>slightly more contemporary now in 2001 I<br>worked for a number of years at the<br>Center for health planning and<br>management worked with a demand<br>management team and English NHS and<br>undertook a number of studies including<br>participatory qualitative research<br>focused on parents perceptions of needs<br>of health services for children with<br>conflicts neurological disability I<br>returned to Dunedin with Brian and<br>Micaiah<br>in mid 2005 and began work at the injury<br>prevention Research Unit my interest in<br>quality of life equity and people's<br>processes through the health and social<br>care systems remained constant but the<br>focus was now more on the condition of<br>injury in 1746 Lord Chesterfield said<br>this if injury an injury is much sooner<br>forgotten than an insult and so it was<br>my rot my job then to investigate<br>whether or not that was true but there<br>was an ancestral connection for me also<br>with injury it had been important in my<br>early family and as it has been no doubt<br>and many of yours<br>this man is my father's great<br>grandfather in namesake macaé Reid so<br>makar Reid worked as an early policeman<br>at the Crystal Palace exhibition in<br>London in 1851 and then in 1857 he<br>travelled with his wife Louisa and these<br>six children to Wellington where he<br>became the first governor of the<br>Wellington Jail from 1860 to 1865 and<br>we're proud of him for opposing the<br>death penalty<br>unfortunately had to witness a lot of<br>executions and his role as governor of<br>the jail but in 1886 so here's the<br>Crystal Palace in 1886 the newspaper<br>reported he was driving his Phaeton done<br>Tory Street in the direction of<br>Courtenay place when his horse became<br>frightened and bolted and came into<br>collision with a butcher's cart the<br>shock was so great that mr. Reed was<br>shot shot up in the air and came down on<br>a wooden crop wooden crossing with great<br>violence and he suffered severe injuries<br>to his head he then required<br>considerable care from his wife Louisa<br>and family until he eventually died<br>three years later macaws outcome ended<br>in being finite sadly for our family and<br>we can only imagine how challenging it<br>must have been for him and his immediate<br>family in the time between his the<br>injury event itself and his passing<br>perhaps surprisingly well it's<br>surprising to me I'm very little is<br>known either nationally or<br>internationally about people's quality<br>of life<br>or experience as post-injury if they<br>weren't weren't killed by the injury<br>event so at IP r u-- i worked on<br>developing what became known as the<br>prospective outcomes of injuries study<br>or poise for short this study was funded<br>by the Health Research Council with<br>co-funding from ACC and the pilot<br>employees ran from 2006 to 2013<br>and because the study is so<br>comprehensive we're still publishing<br>findings from poised and there are a<br>number of interesting features we<br>recruited from five regions throughout<br>New Zealand and insured that 20 percent<br>of the cohort were Maori so that Mauri<br>specific analyses could be undertaken<br>poise was necessary public health<br>research for a number of reasons for<br>example injury fits many of us and it's<br>expensive last year in New Zealand's<br>no-fault injury insurer the accident<br>compensation corporation received almost<br>2 million claims from injured New<br>Zealanders for treatment and spent four<br>point nine billion supporting injured<br>people in New Zealand that's just in one<br>year four point nine billion and there<br>are a number of aspects to the poi study<br>that I our team<br>I believe rightly proud of first and<br>foremost poise was designed with two<br>Maori co-investigators dr. Brendan<br>hakufu Nardin at Waikato and dr. Emma<br>Wyeth now director of the night ahumada<br>Health Research Unit and preventive and<br>social medicine in designing poise we<br>consulted with and listened to Maori<br>Kamara and the five study regions about<br>how the study should operate how we<br>should collect the data and analyze that<br>data and and we've written a paper<br>describing that process<br>dr. wife has since lead the analyses<br>reporting on the outcomes for injured<br>Maori informed by Maori theories of<br>health and well-being so thinking about<br>people power and policy we engaged with<br>people power came about in our listening<br>Temari advisors and taking their dead<br>advice very seriously and changing the<br>design of our study is a consequence<br>acting on this advice has meant poise<br>has been able to deliver findings of<br>relevance to Maori and communities in<br>New Zealand another important aspect of<br>poise has been considering considering<br>the relationships between work injury<br>and outcome one-third of our injured<br>poised participants were injured in the<br>workplace cuts crushers Falls even<br>assaults our ACC earnings related<br>compensation means that people are<br>entitled to up to 80% of their<br>pre-injury income while rehabilitating<br>from injury there has been and general<br>thinking the idea that many people will<br>use an injury event there's a reason to<br>unreasonably linger on ACC while waiting<br>to you know just watching 80 percent of<br>the income rolling and such thinking<br>albeit not based on empirical evidence<br>can influence policy so poised was able<br>to investigate this assumption so with<br>John Rebecca Ari and myself by<br>considering whether or not people had<br>returned to paid employment in relation<br>to the level of disability they're<br>experiencing we found indeed that 8%<br>boys beat us pants who are working<br>before the injury had not returned to<br>sustained paid employment one year post<br>injury however we found that<br>three-quarters of these people<br>three-quarters of that 8% had profound<br>disability leaving only 2% had not<br>returned to pay them<br>and had no profound disability meanwhile<br>also the economic recession had bitten<br>so rather than thinking that 2% were<br>malingering we think it's possible that<br>2% issue its 1.6 percent we're going<br>through redundancy were looking for<br>other pain employment opportunities at<br>the time the policy implications of this<br>is significant when looking at<br>indicators of success of rehabilitation<br>programs ACC and government should look<br>to assist other indicators of outcomes<br>such as disability and indeed we've been<br>told by ACC that poise has informed<br>their focus on how they can better<br>assess outcomes we also looked at what<br>factors predicted not working post<br>injury although there were some<br>individual level factors such as having<br>a number of other conditions or<br>comorbidities there were broader social<br>factors that warranted our attention<br>people on low incomes people<br>dissatisfied with their work and people<br>on temporary or fixed term contracts all<br>experienced disadvantage in terms of<br>returning to paid employment post injury<br>these effect is that we as a society can<br>insured address healthy workplaces<br>humane conditions of employment and<br>living wages are achievable and the<br>recent important states are moving the<br>minimum wage to a living wage in the<br>health sector and it's significant<br>acknowledgement of us from our<br>qualitative research employers we've<br>heard in people's own words the<br>experience of the person with an<br>extremely serious workplace injury being<br>told by their employer on their hospital<br>bed that they no longer had a job to<br>return to you said compared to the<br>person whose employer supported them<br>every step of the way to recovery<br>reassuring them throughout that the job<br>is being held for them and that every<br>accommodation will be made to help them<br>return to work these differences measure<br>but to effect change we need much more<br>legislative support to nudge the poor<br>employer towards the behavior of the God<br>and there are implications for us from<br>our poised research in our own workplace<br>here at the University where we've been<br>going through considerable changes for<br>our professional administrative staff<br>there have been positive changes and new<br>opportunities for some but also painful<br>changes for those made redundant being<br>moved away from departments with Edwards<br>years to other parts of the university<br>or having their jobs downgraded to a<br>lower level in pay scale we have<br>responsibilities as colleagues and<br>students of our university to consider<br>job satisfaction as an important part of<br>people's working environment and to<br>avoid reducing people to sets of<br>transferable skills instead our poised<br>research suggests it's important for us<br>to recognize employees relationships and<br>histories and to recognize people's<br>long-standing commitment to the<br>successful functioning of our university<br>awareness of the need to focus on people<br>and context has been available to us too<br>for many years<br>for example Viktor Frankl reflecting on<br>his years in a concentration camp has<br>written about the importance of<br>relationships and man's search for<br>meaning and Hannah Arendt and the<br>origins of totalitarianism wrote about<br>the risks associated with regarding<br>people as sets of labor skills and if<br>people feeling disconnected from<br>relationships in the sense of identity<br>those connections bring their messages<br>are as relevant to us now in the 21st<br>century as they were in post-world War<br>two another important piece of work from<br>poised was the empirical investigation<br>of the differences between those who<br>have had a serious injury and those who<br>have had a serious illness an issue<br>that's been of interest to many of us in<br>public health for some years for her PhD<br>research sue McAlister who's here in the<br>audience was able to compare the<br>outcomes for a matched sample of injured<br>poised participants receiving 80% of<br>their income from ACC with the outcomes<br>for those and the same age group that<br>had had a stroke<br>the study found considerable differences<br>between the injury group which had ACC<br>cover and the group experienced in<br>stroke both in loss of income so you can<br>see a 13% decline in income for those<br>who had ACC cover but a 60% decline in<br>income for the same age group match<br>sample but group of people who'd had a<br>stroke instead a 60% in decline and<br>income for that group in lower rates of<br>return to paid employment for the group<br>affected by stroke only 49%<br>getting back to work compared to 79% for<br>the same level of functional impairment<br>but that had an injury and they had a<br>lot of support from ACC to help them<br>return to work<br>and similarly analysis from the spinal<br>cord injuries study led by dr. Martin<br>Sullivan and this picture here found<br>similar findings so again we saw the<br>group that was entitled to ACC cover<br>because their spinal cord injury<br>resulted from an injury event much more<br>of them got back to work compared to<br>those whose spinal cord impairment<br>resulted from an illness such as a<br>hemorrhage or a spinal stenosis a much<br>smaller proportion got back to work<br>again addressing such inequities is<br>something that's within our society's<br>grasp we need to consider as a country<br>whether or not we're content with<br>individuals and their farno falling into<br>poverty as a consequence of serious<br>illness while evidence demonstrates the<br>improved outcomes for those with an<br>injury who received adequate support so<br>owen Woodhouse who led the Royal<br>Commission of Enquiry<br>and whose recommendations led to the<br>introduction of ACC which is the system<br>that's the envy of many countries<br>throughout the world always envisaged<br>that ACC would be extended to provide<br>support for those with serious illness<br>and our research strengthens calls that<br>the time to address this evident need<br>has arrived and so last but certainly<br>not least I'm going to talk about<br>service so as professor Blakey said you<br>know an academia those of us who teach<br>our lives are a sort of allocated<br>proportions of time forty percent<br>teaching 40 percent research and 20<br>percent service so I'm going to spend a<br>bit of time talking about service<br>service can be sitting on various<br>academic committees Journal editorial<br>roles but for many of us in public<br>health and other disciplines here at<br>Otago it involves working in our<br>communities and this is my community<br>this is one of Brian's lovely panoramas<br>of of Port charmers and I've been a<br>member of the board of the corporate eye<br>Lodge a facility that provides<br>residential care for people with mental<br>health conditions for a number of years<br>it's based in Port charmers or corporate<br>eye<br>in his wonderful leadership from Amana<br>who lives locally and most of the staff<br>who work there also live locally the<br>engagement of residents and the<br>functioning of corporate I Lodge is key<br>one resident sits on the board in all of<br>these things help make corporate I the<br>place it is but thinking back to the<br>importance of our recognizing<br>professional administrative staff within<br>the context of relationships here at OU<br>Targo I think it's the place of<br>corporate I in the community of Port<br>Charles that benefits all of us who live<br>there the residents are recognized and<br>valued as members of our community with<br>the interests knowledge and skills but I<br>believe the real benefit comes from the<br>recognition that we import charmers are<br>lucky enough to live in a community that<br>cares for our people and people who<br>oftentimes have very great need another<br>service role for me has been in as an<br>active member of bowel cancer New<br>Zealand I honestly don't believe that I<br>recognized the positives of being<br>diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer at<br>the age of 39 but as it turns out there<br>were some positives of course I cannot<br>think Brian Mauck are my parents<br>colleagues and friends enough for the<br>support offered to me at that time and<br>also to the excellent health care I<br>received that's led to my stool being<br>here 14 years on but the positives arose<br>as a consequence really under the<br>inspiration of Professor David Perez a<br>local oncologist who called together a<br>meeting of a group of patients and phone<br>are affected by bowel cancer in New<br>Zealand in 2009 and from their initial<br>meeting we went on to form bowel cancer<br>New Zealand which is a patient and<br>family there charity which has the goal<br>of reducing the impact of bowel cancer<br>on our communities through raising<br>awareness education support in research<br>because back in 2009 it seems hard to<br>believe but there really was very little<br>awareness of bowel cancer in New Zealand<br>as a group of volunteers we've worked<br>hard to raise awareness and change that<br>so that by now I hope that many of you<br>are aware that 3,000 New Zealanders are<br>diagnosed each and every year of bowel<br>cancer and that<br>thirdly 1200 New Zealanders will pass<br>away as a consequence of that diagnosis<br>I hope that many of you know that as<br>many women will die from bowel cancer as<br>died from breast cancer and that as many<br>men will die from bowel cancer as die<br>from prostate cancer and also an<br>importantly that 300 people under the<br>age of 50 under the age of 50 are<br>diagnosed each and every year people as<br>young as teenagers now it's a decade<br>since we first formed and we're<br>beginning to see a national screening<br>program implemented throughout New<br>Zealand<br>this is excellent news but there's a<br>long way to go in bowel cancer New<br>Zealand's working harder than ever with<br>a small part-time staff to ensure that<br>work continues and we move from being<br>recognized from having the country our<br>world worst bowel cancer statistics to a<br>country that has world leader a world<br>leading screening program in place and<br>the last component of service I wish to<br>acknowledge before wrapping up is the<br>Community Health Council which formed as<br>an advisory group to the Southern<br>District Health Board and well South Pho<br>and December 2016 I've been fortunate<br>enough to be the establishment chair of<br>the Community Health Council which<br>includes 11 people from throughout the<br>southern health region system who bring<br>within their community networks and<br>areas of interest ranging from mental<br>health and men's health and I think<br>that's Martin here before who champions<br>there you can see the people's names<br>underneath through to high water Maori<br>we've got Kelly Takara from Japan Ori<br>and matmata Heidi here from Dunedin<br>Pacific health we've got Hannah Holloway<br>Lee from or Maru younger people's health<br>with Rosa Flaherty also bringing her her<br>interests in the lgbtq+ community older<br>people's health worth with Leslie day<br>from ember Cargill and women's health<br>and disabled persons health with Paul<br>O'Grady who's here tonight so these<br>people have come together as a group to<br>provide advice to inform Ian's well<br>south pho in the DHB about how to<br>improve our healthcare system but what's<br>been key to that is recognized and that<br>is a group of 11 people<br>we can't do that and so one of the most<br>significant pieces of work the community<br>health councils been doing has been to<br>develop a framework and to implement a<br>road map to widen the pool of people who<br>are interested in being advisors to the<br>healthcare system and so far we have<br>over 50 people who have expressed<br>interest in being an advisor to the<br>system and over 20 I think that's in the<br>high 20s<br>actively involved in working on specific<br>projects throughout our healthcare<br>system to bring that important be a<br>patient far know community expertise to<br>what the system needs to improve and so<br>if any of you are interested in<br>participating in that program I<br>encourage you to to contact our<br>exceptional advisor Charlotte a denko's<br>who's on the right-hand side of the<br>picture and in the yellow cardigan and<br>participate so I'd like to end my talk<br>by acknowledging the importance of<br>values accompanying our national<br>healthcare system introduced over 80<br>years ago or 80 years ago exactly<br>actually in 1938 it was aspirationally<br>stated that it's the Analia beloit of<br>every person to be secured against a<br>stress for after all the people's<br>well-being as the highest law public<br>health research can help illustrate<br>whether or not such aspirational goals<br>have been realized<br>I would argue that we're not quite there<br>yet but if we all in our various ways be<br>it through research writing art music<br>gardening our conversations with people<br>in our communities we endeavor to<br>participate and change and we're can<br>partner ship with others to do so we're<br>capable of placing people's well-being<br>uppermost which is a shared goal of most<br>of if not all of us working in public<br>health thank you<br>Yoriko I'm Trisha priest I'm the head of<br>department of preventive and social<br>medicine and it's my job to propose a<br>vote of thanks to Sierra for her really<br>interesting talk it's one of the other<br>great things about coming to these talks<br>is that you learn things about your<br>colleagues that you didn't know so thank<br>you for your exposition on your past and<br>your ins history as fascinating<br>professor sara derek has a long<br>association with the department of<br>preventive and social medicine having<br>had three stints with us one as a<br>student and two as employees and we're<br>really delighted to be able to<br>congratulate her on her promotion Sara's<br>title public health and communities<br>people power and policy is a great<br>summary of the breadth of her work and<br>her choice to work in a<br>multidisciplinary way in a very<br>multitude multidisciplinary area at the<br>heart of Sara's talk and work is her<br>concern for people their health the<br>importance of their engagement in<br>research and health services and in the<br>development of health policy and her<br>international expertise which she didn't<br>talk a lot about in patient reported<br>outcomes as an example which arose from<br>her PhD research in which her PhD<br>research also supported and informed her<br>passion for work on equity who work on<br>injury as she said is also informed by<br>her concern for people their empowerment<br>and health and underpinned by principles<br>of equity fairness and system approaches<br>sara exemplifies the engaged academic<br>she not only does research into how<br>health services can be speedy livered<br>she's actively involved in advocating<br>for good services working with end on<br>behalf of groups of patients and the<br>public and I just wanted to highlight<br>the fact as she just mentioned they<br>don't taking on the role of chair of the<br>Kim<br>Health Council which was something as a<br>head of department I can say frankly she<br>didn't need in her life because she's<br>very very busy and all her other things<br>but she took on that role and made it a<br>point made a point of developing a<br>framework to increase the engagement of<br>members of the communities to improve<br>the southern health system many of us in<br>this room we intend to health and Public<br>Health because we wanted to make the<br>world a better place including through<br>improving equity Sarah's work as an<br>inspiration to academics perhaps<br>particularly but by no means exclusively<br>public health academics to get out of<br>the Academy and work with communities<br>work with people as research<br>participants patients citizens to<br>achieve that aim of making the world a<br>better place and that Sarah's challenge<br>to all of us and I for one feel<br>challenged and will do my best to think<br>about how I can do better on that and I<br>really encourage you all to we at<br>preventive and social medicine are lucky<br>and proud to have Sarah as a member of<br>our staff and I'm absolutely delighted<br>to congratulate on her who on her<br>promotion and to celebrate with her I<br>have a small gift to acknowledge her<br>promotion and her talk thank you and<br>I'll now invite you to join us at the<br>staff club to for a function to<br>celebrate Sarah's professorial nurse<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
