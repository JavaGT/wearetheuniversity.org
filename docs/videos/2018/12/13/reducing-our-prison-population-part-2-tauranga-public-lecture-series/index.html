Dr Tauri will also put forward an argument for the enhanced involvement of community-based providers and justice advocates in the reconfiguration of the criminal justice system.<br><br>Dr Tauri is a member of the Ngāti Porou iwi and a lecturer in criminology in the School of Sociology and Social Policy, University of Waikato. A graduate of the University of Cambridge, he is a critical commentator of Indigenous peoples' issues with settler colonial criminal justice systems. Dr Tauri has undertaken research projects in New Zealand, Canada and Australia on a diverse range of topics, including youth gangs, domestic violence, Indigenous experiences of prison and the globalisation of restorative justice. He has published widely and is currently undertaking research on the intersection of race, ethnicity and the development of restorative justice programmes, and on Indigenous youth experiences of criminal justice in New Zealand, Australia and the US, as part of a joint University of Waikato and University of Auckland project funded by the Marsden Foundation.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

have<br>a more just society we retreat each<br>other better<br>we actually have to deal with the wider<br>social structural context yeah we have<br>to in other words to my mind if we<br>really wanted to reduce the prison<br>muster and reduce reoffending<br>victimization yeah we need to attend to<br>the precarious economy we need to attend<br>to<br>absolutely shocking situation rehousing<br>and homelessness the poor educational<br>attainment the the rubbish I was going<br>to use another word level of funding for<br>our state schools in comparison to other<br>schools and particularly within poor<br>communities yeah only then I think are<br>we going to be able to actually<br>significant to reduce the prison Buster<br>by 30 percent the criminal justice<br>system not just policy Corrections but<br>all of them I'm not going to do it I'm<br>not going to do it well okay let me<br>rephrase it we can do it purely through<br>the criminal justice sector but we're<br>not going to be not going to do it<br>because of the political nature of crime<br>control yeah I'll cry and control how<br>much time do I help you okay I'll skip<br>forward to to the strategies for<br>reducing the prison population okay it's<br>not going to do it okay here's I've got<br>about four or five solutions that I<br>would offer to Minister little of he was<br>here and well maybe our friends and<br>corrections can can email and say hey<br>Lance is this do this okay so anyway you<br>have my my callers we cannot rely on the<br>sector itself to greatly reduce the<br>prison popular or to reduce offending<br>okay but I want to focus on the sector<br>itself what could it do maybe to help<br>one is we need to depoliticize<br>quiet control policy we need to mirror<br>what's happened in finland 20 years or<br>so ago there was an agreement a<br>cross-party agreement not to politicize<br>crime and social harm they have across a<br>party advisory group which includes<br>external experts psychologists<br>criminologists those expert and<br>development of in community programs<br>okay who come together scrutinize what's<br>going on in Finland in relation to<br>offending and victimization and put<br>forward solutions reprograms<br>interventions legislation to government<br>of the day there is of course party<br>agreement not to do what happens here<br>and as in Australia many think I'll just<br>come from eight and a half years in<br>Australia that we are our politicians<br>are so well behaved pizzas and the stuff<br>they say anyway but you know what happen<br>all of us know that every election cycle<br>crime and crime control is one of the<br>top three or four policy or social<br>issues that they all focus on and we all<br>of us you know when you listen to the<br>rhetoric everyone's trying to outdo each<br>other acts indeed first the<br>Conservatives well they not done exist<br>anymore<br>okay national labor even labor ok come<br>through what are we going to do and then<br>every one of them's a thousand more<br>police which is what we got through the<br>agreement with easiest a thousand police<br>by the way I have no issues generally<br>with the police I'm gonna say one or two<br>things now that may may not may<br>contradict that okay but a thousand<br>police is not going to reduce crime an<br>effective anything a probably will<br>increase certain types of crime because<br>there's more of them around the eighty<br>to catch my young cousins doing naughty<br>things and what-have-you yeah may make<br>some of you fuel at least from a<br>distance safer knowing that there's more<br>of them around but my guess is just<br>having a look and I mean no disrespect<br>across the audience that you a lot of<br>you won't see those increased police my<br>community Waldo yeah and the more they<br>police and surveil my community the more<br>of us they'd end up in prison some<br>because we're bared and some for other<br>reasons all right<br>people are sizing Crime Control Policy<br>okay that way we don't have this every<br>collection cycle outdoing each other<br>increasing prison sentences yeah more<br>police bah bah blah we've been at this<br>for 30 years do you feel any safer know<br>what most of you I'm speaking of most<br>yeah okay to my second suggestion is<br>that we our policy sector especially in<br>our politicians need to get over what I<br>call are you all heard of the term<br>cultural cringe ask New Zealanders<br>apparently suffer from it greatly always<br>looking overseas going it's better over<br>there I've been over there it's not it's<br>not over that's Dutch anyway in<br>Australia speaking those own indigenous<br>person I can tell you it's not better I<br>was looking through the comb art to it<br>before year that they pay more money I'm<br>well I'm well generous generous through<br>your numerator that why cotton but<br>nowhere near is but I don't have to put<br>up with all sorts of anyway sorry<br>getting off track while I call what we<br>have in the policy secular policy cringe<br>okay we need to get over the policy<br>cringe we need to empower the community<br>those that do the mahi are the work<br>would who work directly with victims<br>offenders and invariably I'm not saying<br>verily know<br>what they these communities they would<br>require to be to be well okay to move on<br>from social harm the impact of social<br>harm that includes by the way offenders<br>they know how what required to respond<br>meaningfully to social issues that arise<br>from social harm and I think that the<br>criminal justice policy set there needs<br>to work with them more as partners<br>rather than the sort of one-way<br>consultative process that generally<br>character it has characterized quite<br>control policy development is Eiland for<br>30 years okay this way i think we will<br>have a better chance of developing more<br>effective socially grounded solutions to<br>social harm and particularly to<br>victimization<br>and I think that this will also stop a<br>policy process that has been quite<br>damaging for our community service<br>providers and that is it will stop this<br>silly process of the importation of<br>interventions from social context that<br>are not reflective of the New Zealand<br>context like for example what's my fav<br>Innes T mo systemic therapy my favorite<br>grana mid-2000s ministry of justice here<br>we've got this great idea we've got<br>we're going to bring in this wraparound<br>multi-agency program from Bristol in<br>England which is called hot families and<br>so we're going to identify these these<br>high crime families when you know<br>intergenerational offending or prison<br>man or just intergenerational social<br>issues like unemployment etc etc and<br>we're all going to wrap around them and<br>give them support a SEP that was really<br>highly highly and it was more stick than<br>carrot so you'd have said well the<br>police look I said well how will this<br>work well the police will do the data<br>and they'll turn up and go your inaudi<br>family there are hot family and if you<br>don't pull your bloody wool socks up<br>alright and then you know chalk your<br>protection is going to be in everything<br>we're going on you do know that and up<br>in Auckland we have a couple of Mari and<br>specifically and those that deliver to<br>you so I guess poor party our families<br>actually in the South Auckland and West<br>Auckland and they'd be doing this kind<br>of mahi for about you know 20 years<br>Minister justice official really I said<br>yeah you guys you guys partly funded and<br>I said so when you have this example in<br>New Zealand context that's actually how<br>do you know it's working well well we<br>didn't have any empirical evidence<br>because of course one of the things<br>that's also and I haven't gotten my<br>notes just remembered as missing as we<br>do not have we do not fund for an imp to<br>develop an evidential basis in New<br>Zealand we don't do a lot of outcome we<br>do too much formative evaluation on<br>about our outcome evaluation alright<br>anyway I said well okay so I have some<br>anecdotal evidence you do yeah<br>chalk ear protection services and and<br>police are constantly ringing these<br>these providers can you take this one<br>can you take<br>all right so that's some some anecdotal<br>evidence I'll record an empirical they<br>policy cringe Hester we have to start<br>believing that what we can actually<br>develop interventions here that suit our<br>social context yeah so it needs to be<br>more trust in the community three here I<br>get to the the really political that<br>have you thought ahead and ready I'm<br>going to argue that we need less<br>criminalization lesson puzzlement and we<br>need more treatment and social support<br>there is a simple why people have<br>agreement okay there is a simplest<br>response there is a simple response that<br>will reduce the prison population really<br>quickly yeah and enable the minister to<br>meet a snooty percent reduction yeah<br>stop seeing people to prison all right<br>stop arresting people charging them<br>sending the court sent him send them to<br>imprisonment for victimless crimes like<br>for example a lot of drug offenses at<br>the moment I think the drug offending<br>the populate prison population is around<br>about 12 percent right okay and we have<br>about five percent that I like for<br>administrative breaching blah blah blah<br>well we could regreat lee reduce right<br>decriminalization by treating those in<br>effect you know what I think violence is<br>the biggest category 35 36 percent 45<br>now that's funny because I just went<br>online and had a look at your guys<br>report today so I'm reading alright I'm<br>reading an old report even worse okay<br>yep enough okay and we do know that a<br>number of these people these offenders<br>effect let's talk just generally across<br>the prison population when I was working<br>at University of Wollongong I was in<br>touch with a whole bunch of researchers<br>from the University of New South Wales<br>who had just finished a detailed study<br>of New South Wales present population an<br>estimated there over 55 to 58 percent of<br>Maryland mates had diagnosable mental<br>health conditions yeah a significant<br>number of those were the ones that also<br>were exhibiting drug and alcohol<br>dependency issues<br>these people are unwell and we put them<br>in an environment that is questionably<br>therapeutic like the prison and which<br>only a very small number of these<br>individuals will receive treatment and<br>then we let them out and what do you<br>think happens they continue to victimize<br>others yeah so let's also think about<br>where they get these mental health<br>disorders from are they born with them<br>some how many of them okay are<br>significantly traumatized by their own<br>experiences of for example in the female<br>prison population domestic violence or<br>all that's however it's characterized or<br>played out okay and including some of<br>our men for evidence of this I give you<br>dr. Liz Stanley from Victoria<br>diversities 2016 publication the road to<br>hell state violence against children and<br>post war New Zealand and that she's<br>talking about the postal system and I'm<br>sure many of us in here remember I come<br>from a family a huge family my dad's one<br>of 18 between 1960 and 1968 I was one of<br>17 boys born into that family I was the<br>only one that didn't go to Boston over<br>half of my and why did my cousins<br>my uncle young uncles go to borstal most<br>of them for think pinching goods before<br>we had the the book tokens yeah I'm not<br>looking at any young people they went on<br>talking about we used to put out our<br>pennies two of my cousin's got caught<br>stealing that in divorce till two years<br>raped beaten okay bye-bye not only the<br>other inmates if you want to call them<br>that but especially by the people it's<br>supposed to be caring for them through<br>the Department of Social Welfare where<br>did went and where did we get when we<br>hit the fifty percent plus<br>overrepresentation in prisons in<br>nineteen eighty we have a significant<br>amount of the men especially at that<br>time where did they come from originally<br>they came from that group that went to<br>Boston okay<br>I actually had one cousin he he got and<br>this is I only I need I didn't not go<br>only because I could run really fast the<br>police and why knew at the time where I<br>grew up we're not very fit and I was<br>absolutely terrified of my mother but<br>anyway I had I had one cousin who went<br>inside because he day the local the<br>local school inspector deemed that he<br>had a an issue with authority he had an<br>attitude problem so anyway so alluding<br>to the trauma of offenders as I know I'm<br>popular for some okay and generally when<br>I when I make that statement it brings<br>forth comments from people like you're<br>making excuses for their crime for this<br>serious crime oh no I'm not I'm offering<br>an explanation for it and if we accept<br>it as an explanation that some of them<br>are actually highly traumatized<br>individuals which by the way a raft an<br>extensive amount truckload of research<br>and comparable jurisdictions overseas<br>like you're not a kingdom in North<br>America demonstrate well we don't have<br>that here and I'll get into that top<br>evidence here I'll get to that in a<br>moment<br>alright then okay unless we attend to<br>their trauma they are going to continue<br>to traumatize others yeah I know it's<br>time I yeah okay can I do one more one<br>more<br>I'm going to miss out bias and racism<br>some of you go think for that think<br>thank you for there yeah I have one here<br>let us in and this is personal right and<br>this attack test this pertains to the<br>lack of evidence that we have about what<br>works etc etc the crime control sector<br>and New Zealand needs to let go<br>only it needs to grow up a little bit<br>needs to stop being so risk adverse it<br>needs to allow independent researchers<br>and like myself and others she's all<br>about me to undertake critical<br>independent research the truth is over<br>the last and one of the reasons why I<br>left these shores to go to Australia and<br>I reinterred my research to two other<br>settler colonial contexts was because me<br>and my colleagues people like Rob Webb<br>from might occur monologist from from<br>Auckland than others or continuously<br>blocked and been able to carry out any<br>independent scrutiny of the Prison<br>Service or policing especially or bias<br>within the system or racism if you want<br>to call it that bias at all level<br>whether it be class racial race based on<br>class ethnicity or gender yeah<br>continuously blocking us from doing this<br>work you know they've been very making<br>it very difficult for independent<br>researchers to to scrutinize the<br>performance although come back and tell<br>you all you know back in 2011 we let<br>so-and-so did their PhD research alright<br>but often the research they carry out as<br>undertaken by themselves or contracted<br>out to others and they they want control<br>okay over that type of research some of<br>you and just an example before I say<br>goodbye or I finish was remember would<br>have heard of I think now he's probably<br>the most preeminent criminologist now at<br>least years until I can be was chair was<br>Jared Gilbert down from Canterbury<br>University right and it will may have<br>heard of the cut of his case last year<br>okay when he and his colleagues wanted<br>to do research in terms of pot around<br>policing and they applied to the police<br>to actually get hold of data that they<br>hold data by the way their towers right<br>it's<br>poverty we own it right and they went<br>yeah okay but first of all we've got a<br>scrutinize you to make sure that you're<br>a pet you know that you're a suitable<br>person a researcher and then when you if<br>you are we'll give you a contract to<br>sign a contract which by the way they've<br>now currently changed which had causes<br>and it like we we we will get all our<br>copies drafts we we would have the right<br>to advise me that you can publish a lot<br>your research and we will dictate we<br>will that take any changes that need to<br>be made before it got that far they Dean<br>Jared unsuitable because of his gang<br>connections<br>Jared Gilbert's gang connections where<br>he did his PhD on gangs right this is<br>his gang connections oh you're an<br>associate well oh and then he he<br>challenged it and he publicized it thank<br>God it was overturned and that's<br>pleasing because there's no mighty<br>family that I know even the really good<br>ones that do not have some affiliation<br>with the gangs I have two cousins in the<br>mob and one on the black power okay I<br>drink with them I socialize with them<br>I've done research on the gangs they<br>would have deemed me unsuitable because<br>of the critical work that I start<br>research that I carry out okay with this<br>particular community<br>I think this attitude needs to change<br>okay the signal needs to grow up it<br>needs to allow critical scrutiny okay it<br>needs to be stopped being so precious<br>right yeah they don't get it that we<br>know they get things right as well as<br>get things wrong okay but at all they<br>actually allow us the critical scrutiny<br>until they are let until they actually<br>move away from importing interventions<br>from overseas okay and empower our own<br>communities we're not going to reduce<br>the prison population thank you very<br>much<br>sorry I win a bit over time such it's<br>such an important topic please don't<br>apologize Christians ladies and<br>gentleman just a few and one will stay<br>behind to speak as well any questions<br>hands up so I can see yep yeah thanks<br>very much for that<br>I'll just got a question about the<br>decriminalization of drugs he suggested<br>that as a way to reduce the population<br>you live the Portugal situation where<br>they sort of legalized all drugs about<br>17 years ago and what they actually<br>found was the police just ended up<br>because it's sort of they needed<br>something to do they just film different<br>people to put them what's your response<br>to that ah yeah that's been one of the<br>knock-on effects of that policy change<br>there's that's anecdotal rather than<br>empirical I have heard that claim but<br>I've also what I do know which is<br>empirical is that the decriminalization<br>of drugs Oh<br>decriminalization of drugs but also<br>refocusing or policing okay not so<br>concerned about you know Joe Bloggs or<br>Jose Boggs walking down the road having<br>a joint yeah or having a little bit of<br>tack on them what have you okay by the<br>way if you're caught you don't get off<br>scot-free you know they don't you<br>treatment so what what they actually did<br>was they did criminalized but they sent<br>it refocused on what we call therapeutic<br>jurisprudence okay so and so you will go<br>into you know you need to go into drug<br>and alcohol related therapy yeah and so<br>they took the money that they were going<br>to they forget that they were going to<br>save from decriminalization or deed<br>focusing over to refocusing over to<br>social support I guess and greatly and<br>significantly increase their spend on<br>treatment and therapy yeah but but what<br>then what the police resources were Dean<br>told to do was actually refocus on our<br>major importation because Portugal at<br>that time when they did this<br>decriminalization and refocusing was one<br>of the gateways okay from cert from<br>Italy from the Mafia and from Columbia<br>Annette into a liver lands etc and out<br>into other jurisdictions yeah and so<br>what they've also done is they've had a<br>significant decrease in the number of<br>minor of drug offenders going to prison<br>and the knock-on effect of that have you<br>said that year you right the police<br>obviously as you see because this is one<br>of the major strategies and tasks have<br>been reoriented elsewhere yeah in terms<br>of getting there because they have a job<br>to do right and they're not gonna do<br>themselves out of a job but yeah thank<br>I um I just wanted to in here any of<br>your research being a foster parent and<br>having two boys with us permanently that<br>are marry and marry an Indian so it's a<br>bit of a learning curve with us but my<br>question is I'm if you've in any of your<br>research have you determined the<br>percentage of former foster children<br>that are in the in there prison system<br>and any ideas on how to reduce those<br>numbers because from what I've heard<br>it's like seventy five percent whether<br>that's accurate or not I don't know New<br>Zealand context okay Jim million I think<br>I'll expand it out to the percentage and<br>state that company mistake here it is<br>significant seventy I've not found it in<br>researchers not a research issue that<br>I've dealt with I would say that that's<br>probably quite high in a New Zealand<br>context but I think a significant<br>percentage will come from from the<br>widest take care<br>are you mean foster like those who have<br>actually been taken from child care and<br>protection services through their<br>processes and put into foster year the<br>percentage would be hired I'd be<br>surprised if it was that high and so we<br>but we haven't had any research in that<br>context in New Zealand in any meaningful<br>way we do though have research has been<br>done for example on this issue and the<br>United States and particularly in Canada<br>because like Canada like here a<br>significant majority of children that<br>I've lifted young people uplifted by<br>talking protection services of his<br>nation okay and a significant majority<br>of Finnish nation adults and the<br>correction both the federal and<br>provincial correctional systems and<br>Canada have come through have been<br>uplifted yeah and and in Australia I<br>think I would not be surprised if the<br>figures for Australian adult male and<br>female and prisons and some<br>jurisdictions like Western Australia and<br>Northern Territory which would have the<br>highest rate of imprison where there<br>isn't any indigenous people would be<br>pretty much close to around 70 to 80<br>percent in those jurisdictions will come<br>through the system we call it at the<br>part of Morley's a colleague of mine<br>lecturer and social work and another<br>activist academic<br>was that the the childcare Protection to<br>Prison Pipeline it's so prominent and<br>Australia some indigenous critical<br>scholars actually referred to it okay as<br>the second stolen generation yeah so but<br>I'm so the answer is uh I'm not I'm not<br>aware of any research that demonstrates<br>that New Zealand I would be surprised<br>about seventy five percent and other<br>jurisdictions that certainly is for<br>indigenous people and as to how we deal<br>with that I'm sorry I think I just<br>allude to well ok firstly how much time<br>do I have<br>maybe we could talk about there half to<br>this because I think it would take a<br>really mult a multi prong approach I<br>have a su with child care protection<br>being so easily empowered to uplift our<br>children for Marty now one of the issues<br>related to that which is problematic<br>problematic for us not so much in the<br>kernel justice sector as what we can see<br>now is what we what part is also<br>referred to as the child care and<br>protection to adoption pipeline and<br>jurisdictions like in New South Wales<br>and New South Wales has just made it<br>easier for the correct for child care<br>protection and adoption eight services<br>to adopt out children without permission<br>of the appearance usually problematic<br>hugely problematic for Aboriginal<br>peoples and this is becoming prevalent<br>across that jurisdiction alright and so<br>our fear is that our kids are going to<br>be are going to easily uplifted as it is<br>that they're going to be streamed into<br>this particular into this particular<br>pipeline and there was evidence of that<br>occurring in Australia so anyway I kind<br>of got slightly off topic one final<br>hi I recently saw the documentary Celia<br>you know Celia Leslie yeah yeah and she<br>she spoke about the need to focus on<br>woman and the the flow on effect of<br>woman who are in in prison and in the<br>children of those woman's who are highly<br>likely to end up in prison<br>no and I just wonder if you know<br>anything about that whether that is<br>happening in New Zealand in terms of<br>focusing on and supporting those woman<br>that need who are the mothers of future<br>poor poor Corrections gonna get hit<br>again sorry I think it's safe to say<br>that for a lot of women that go into a<br>prison will to me to be the primary care<br>giver for their children and if that's<br>the case then a lot of them will put our<br>like are being uplifted eventually by<br>talk to him protection services yeah so<br>I think that's that's pretty common<br>practice I think or common occurrence<br>what support do we give and see here was<br>right not a hell of a lot a policy work<br>or support for women inmates and in most<br>Western jurisdictions actually takes<br>place and complete to me why because men<br>make up the vast majority yet as a woman<br>tend to be secondary of secondary<br>consumer most of our policy focus in<br>terms of for example post doesn't<br>support etc since reintegration<br>strategies Germany focuses on on men<br>even and but I guess the argument that's<br>been made by feminists criminologists<br>nothing and people like a senior as well<br>which is actually a powerful one is that<br>they may be smaller number but the fact<br>that the our primary caregivers etc been<br>the compound and effect as significantly<br>more than the attention that I get the<br>resourcing that's given to their needs<br>that makes sense okay I will give you<br>I'll give you an example and end it and<br>as evidence that Germany and of course<br>it made things<br>I've changed the corrections now<br>certainly hasn't a new Southland and the<br>Australian jurisdictions that I studied<br>when I was in a strike working in<br>Australia giving an example around the<br>early to mid-2000s they work all was<br>came from Minister Tariana Turia who was<br>the Associate Minister of Corrections at<br>the time that she was a poor that there<br>was no actual imprisoned tikanga based<br>program for a woman martí woman as they<br>were for me and so I was part of the<br>policy team they said ok make it happen<br>and what do you think that they did now<br>I took the men's one and they added wo<br>on the front and it was pointed out and<br>my colleagues on that team were<br>absolutely mortified all-female policy<br>advisers and what have you to say that<br>you know that the route and the argument<br>that was well we have no actual research<br>telling us what the actual needs of my<br>of my tea or other woman in prisons are<br>in New Zealand yeah that's because<br>they'd ever do any yeah but we do have<br>and we pointed out was and response was<br>we have significant evidence especially<br>from feminists criminological research<br>of the dinner fires that woman and<br>prison have vastly different needs and<br>require in social you know they have far<br>more trauma in their lives etcetera<br>etcetera histories which actually<br>there's not being attended to yeah and<br>those jurisdictions that we are<br>constantly going over comparing<br>ourselves to and bringing policies back<br>from Australia United Kingdom North<br>America and that was ignored so that was<br>at the time it may have changed now to<br>me was and I think explains why there's<br>a real issue is ongoing is that woman<br>don't really matter because they're not<br>submit a II they're not generally as<br>serious offenders there's not as many of<br>them and the sector is about and I'll<br>add on this top on this coming the stick<br>there is not so much about for all its<br>rhetoric in its marketing as less<br>focused on reducing making us safer and<br>reducing harm<br>is controlling risk risk to itself was<br>to it<br>budgets risk to its ministers what we<br>called when I was working in government<br>the front page of The Evening Post test<br>anyway I think we'll leave it the area<br>yeah okay thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
