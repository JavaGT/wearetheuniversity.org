Dr Tauri will also put forward an argument for the enhanced involvement of community-based providers and justice advocates in the reconfiguration of the criminal justice system.<br><br>Dr Tauri is a member of the Ngāti Porou iwi and a lecturer in criminology in the School of Sociology and Social Policy, University of Waikato. A graduate of the University of Cambridge, he is a critical commentator of Indigenous peoples' issues with settler colonial criminal justice systems. Dr Tauri has undertaken research projects in New Zealand, Canada and Australia on a diverse range of topics, including youth gangs, domestic violence, Indigenous experiences of prison and the globalisation of restorative justice. He has published widely and is currently undertaking research on the intersection of race, ethnicity and the development of restorative justice programmes, and on Indigenous youth experiences of criminal justice in New Zealand, Australia and the US, as part of a joint University of Waikato and University of Auckland project funded by the Marsden Foundation.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

really a wonderful introduction I<br>don't speak the rule so I was really<br>happy when I heard he was coming to<br>speak and open that properly so I'm<br>always very thankful when others can<br>speak on my behalf<br>coming from that generation when just<br>prior to when the school started to<br>actually have they all taught in them we<br>had our own schools and what have you<br>which was actually a driver of one of<br>the key reasons why I chose to come back<br>to New Zealand to take up a position at<br>University of Waikato which I started in<br>June after eight and a half years in<br>Australia so my my four-year-old my<br>surprise for my partner I could come<br>back here and actually do in the room<br>and have their privilege and its own<br>meaning of Komar to her and Korea<br>actually fought for reducing our prison<br>population past failures and new<br>approaches I've never spent so long on<br>thinking about and writing notes for a<br>talk as I had for this one mainly<br>because I had no idea what you were<br>going to be like because I'm used to<br>lecturing of course and also speaking at<br>academic conferences and and<br>practitioner based conferences like the<br>one I just spoke it at Saskatoon<br>Saskatchewan and and in Canada so you're<br>kind of what you're least you'd think<br>you know yeah you normally get two or<br>three kind of elements or components of<br>the audience and I he's sitting around<br>for a week I have no idea what I'm in<br>for<br>and you probably don't either so that's<br>right so we both start from the same<br>from the same position all right<br>so here we go before I start that I<br>always start with a cabbie yet this is<br>related to the position that I take I am<br>considered by many or I've caught a lot<br>of things so this is the nicest thing I<br>hear about myself as an activist<br>academic and I see it as my role texting<br>speak on behalf of not only marty but<br>now Mota who the disaffected the<br>socially disadvantaged okay so I put it<br>out there that outlet right away okay<br>you are not going to be listening to a<br>an academic that claims any empirical<br>objectivity to his position that's not<br>to say that my the research that I don't<br>do is not as I believe if a call okay an<br>empirical okay but I do start from the<br>position of wanting to speak on behalf<br>of Marty and other disaffected okay<br>communities all right so just so that<br>you know secondly I am going to be<br>controversial I'm sure for many of you<br>and the and the issues that I'm going to<br>raise and the statement that I'm going<br>to make please don't take it personally<br>okay what I am intending here is to add<br>I think at least my small almost my<br>small sort of donation if you like<br>towards the process that the new<br>government was going to say the labor<br>government but apparently indeed few<br>supporters get really annoyed so I think<br>it's the just call it the coalition<br>government okay has started in relation<br>to the Minister of Justice injury<br>littles desire<br>stated desire to have a critical<br>analysis of the performance of the<br>criminal justice system with a view to<br>what he calls or he's called significant<br>changes necessary changes to make our<br>system more effective an effective<br>meaning reducing reoffending offending<br>reoffending and social harm okay and<br>make it more just<br>okay so<br>by the way if that's anyway those are<br>the cab Utes here so please don't take<br>it too personally I will be critiquing<br>the policy industry and in the policy<br>industry I'm talking about yes or more<br>my ex colleagues that work in Parliament<br>okay down in the the core the lepton key<br>triangle and Wellington and the<br>institutions of crime control okay so if<br>there's any people from corrections the<br>Ministry of Justice and policing that<br>here yeah this is not aimed at you<br>personally man I could I could have that<br>I easily about half an hour of caveats<br>before start so earlier this year the<br>Minister of Justice changer a little as<br>most of you hopefully we know announce<br>the latest and what throughout my career<br>has been at least since about the mid to<br>late 1980s a long line of reviews<br>taxpayer-funded summits interagency<br>whole of government I do that because<br>it's usually the same players that are<br>involved projects that are aimed at<br>making the criminal justice system work<br>more efficiently and effectively now<br>this was officially launched at a summit<br>only a couple of months ago that was<br>holding Polydor and the stated aim of<br>the review that the minister has called<br>is to reduce New Zealand's prison muster<br>by about 30 percent over the next 15<br>years I have some personal professional<br>views about that target but I don't<br>think I could use the language that I<br>would usually describe it in an audience<br>like this ambitious actually is probably<br>the most polite word that I could use<br>this is based on the fact that about<br>10-12 years ago the Department of<br>Corrections through the administer at<br>the time announced that they were going<br>to actually attain a 15% reduction in<br>the prison muster okay and we didn't<br>even get close to that and here I come<br>and I'm in Australia about the breather<br>come back and then they announced it's a<br>30% one so you would understand my<br>apprehension at whether or not they can<br>actually achieve this anyway enough<br>about that and in terms of announcing<br>this review a significant focus was<br>called by the Minister<br>on the significant over-representation<br>of marty and the prison population<br>specifically and in the criminal justice<br>system overall i'm not going to focus<br>entirely on the mighty so-called mighty<br>problem okay but i will allude to it<br>every now and then and this most<br>especially at the end so as I said in<br>the beginning that my presentation I<br>think hopefully will represent a a<br>modest offering they came response to<br>the current government's attempts to to<br>make the system more effective and more<br>just okay before I move into the main<br>part of the presentation I want to say<br>something about my focus and the intent<br>of my commentary okay so there are two<br>key themes that will run through my<br>rhetoric and hopefully will actually<br>join the different elements together<br>okay and the first is that the policy<br>sector the kind of policy industry in<br>Wellington primarily and the political<br>class that it supports has had the lead<br>for decades now and developing<br>implementing responses to crime and more<br>widely to social harm that occurs in our<br>communities it's fair to say I think<br>that it's the impact of all this work<br>has been mixed okay with as many<br>failures as there has been successes<br>although given the lack of independent<br>scrutiny of governmental activities that<br>is allowed in New Zealand this is a very<br>subjective proposition that I am making<br>rather than a fully empirical one that's<br>my academic way of saying we don't get<br>to do much critical research on the<br>activity or scrutiny related to the<br>scrutiny of the performance of the<br>kernel justice sector and I'll actually<br>deal with it at the end of my talk when<br>I talk about what I believe are some of<br>the necessary changes to the system yeah<br>however regardless of its of its many<br>failures in my view it is necessary part<br>of any attempt that we make to actually<br>reduce the prison population and so a<br>reform of the pollak sorry<br>reform with the policy sector and of the<br>political context of crime control<br>policy development New Zealand is<br>absolutely necessary if we are to in<br>fact meet this 30 percent target that<br>the<br>Minister has sick okay<br>and so I'm offering I'm going to<br>critique the performance of the policy<br>sector but hopefully with a view to not<br>embarrassing<br>partly baby persuading them<br>okay dead it's time to change their<br>weight because I think they've had long<br>enough okay and actually formulating on<br>our behalf<br>responses to to crime and social harm so<br>that's the first if you like theme the<br>second is that I believe any substantive<br>move or moves to reduce the prison<br>population requires a significant<br>increase enhancement that the role that<br>communities which includes<br>community-based service providers okay<br>the academic class were wanted a bit of<br>ten and the development and delivery of<br>policies and interventions that are<br>aimed at reducing criminal behavior the<br>days of the wholesale importation of<br>policies and interventions from other<br>high crimes restrictions like United<br>States Great Britain etc okay that has<br>characterized the development and<br>delivery of Crime Control Policy in New<br>Zealand since over the last thirty years<br>has to stop okay they need this needs<br>this type of strategy of responding to<br>reducing social harm and criminy<br>Dylan has to change there needs to be a<br>reorientation of the politic by the<br>political class and by the policy sector<br>back to ok supporting our own providers<br>and communities to develop and deliver<br>programs and interventions that are more<br>suited to our social context ok whether<br>that be Marty Park a new migrant those<br>that were specific immunities etc ok<br>that's a very long introduction so I'll<br>get into the I've got a two-part<br>presentation and the first one I call<br>politely overview of password attempts<br>to review criminal justice ok so by way<br>of background you hit my academic<br>background but before in between<br>starting lecturing at Victoria<br>University in the mid-90s and going back<br>to the Academy into nine I actually<br>worked in policy for ten years okay most<br>of that time that seven seven and a half<br>years were spent at the pinnacle kadhi<br>Ministry of my development where I had<br>the wonderful job job I loved actually<br>scrutinizing Crime Control Policy so as<br>you can imagine I was very popular with<br>with the criminal justice sector policy<br>people and I hid and I did a six-month<br>sentence it was I felt like a sentence<br>at corrections he'd office I actually<br>was gonna talk about that at length and<br>then I took all the notes out because I<br>thought it might be a bit personal and<br>you know and I did a bit of time at<br>Ministry of Social Development and two<br>roles one is an advisor on my team<br>Pacifica research and the research and<br>evaluation unit within the<br>administrating for about 18 months when<br>the best jobs I had when government was<br>a regional policy advisor I'm telling<br>you this at length so that you know that<br>I'm not just in it someone I went to<br>school at most summer most some<br>academics okay that I've worked with<br>school undergrad post-grad PhD<br>University know an asset of employee<br>right okay so I actually worked in the<br>policy sector and I went there<br>abstention fiercely on a two-year<br>contract so that I could actually find<br>out the nuts and bolts and how policy<br>worked so that when I jumped out of it<br>being an activist I could critique them<br>and they couldn't say as often happens<br>where you really don't know how policy<br>but they paid me so well and I had so<br>much fun critiquing and when I was at<br>Tony Hawk I had I had an insider's view<br>that most activists and academics don't<br>get I was on the ground while policy<br>major policies and legislation was being<br>formulated to see how they worked in<br>other words I may be a bit unpopular<br>with the policy shift in Wellington<br>because they know that I know where the<br>bodies are buried<br>okay I will you so I just want to give<br>you that background I will use examples<br>in case study case studies came from my<br>policy and research experience to<br>firstly highlight reasons some of the<br>reasons why I believe we have failed to<br>arrest the rate of imprisonment in this<br>country to fail to reduce in any<br>meaningful measure the harm that occurs<br>from crime and victimization that occurs<br>in their communities and or to eradicate<br>bias and racism which unfortunately does<br>exist in our criminal justice system<br>despite what the Commissioner or police<br>may say about unintended an intended<br>bias unconscious bias sorry I'll talk<br>about that too - I want to only utilize<br>these case studies and examples to<br>evidence my key argument for a<br>significant overhaul of the policy<br>industry and a reduction in the<br>political classes influence on crime<br>control policy without which any<br>significant reduction in crime and<br>social harm and use of imprisonment is<br>impossible okay so when I did my<br>six-month standard Corrections this is<br>the first example I moved here in 2001 I<br>just done two years at so I just<br>creaking is interesting so as I try not<br>to move I tend to move right so I'll try<br>and I'll trying to keep still okay so I<br>arrived into our Corrections in 2002 one<br>and right at that point is anyone from<br>Corrections here oh cool you're gonna<br>love this bit okay they just started to<br>implement integrated offender management<br>okay now I know it's one I know it's all<br>slightly changed now it's different from<br>me but anyway I'm just using this as an<br>example yeah okay and I actually think<br>that this<br>case-study encapsulates all that was is<br>wrong with Crime Control Policy SiC<br>there in New Zealand yeah I remember<br>before see they do some things right and<br>they have some successes or I'm not<br>actually going to highlight those why<br>because the corrections and MOJ and the<br>police I'm really good at telling us how<br>fantastic they are they have politie<br>you're going to pick on you now the<br>corrections had their own policy Journal<br>and what's the you know they they tell<br>us how wonderfully successful their<br>programs are blah blah blah<br>police have all their marketing on<br>that's not my job all right they do it<br>themselves yeah cool<br>so anyway so in relation to the<br>integrated offender management it was<br>evident and why do I think that actually<br>encapsulates all that was wrong with the<br>way in which we developed chronic<br>control policy and Wellington and it was<br>evident from when I first started that<br>senior management was hell-bent on<br>introducing the process regardless of<br>any criticism any dissent any critical<br>external critical analysis which of<br>which there was very little because they<br>were very good at protecting the the<br>product and themselves from any external<br>critique and for that reason I found<br>coming from TPK that the consultation<br>with internal external stakeholders was<br>highly superficial generally kind of<br>like the tick the box exercise that as<br>community groups are highly critical of<br>in relation to government so-called<br>consultative processes yeah when what we<br>want is engagement yeah we want we want<br>to wait dialogue and generally this is<br>not what played out in relation to the<br>integrated offender management program I<br>personally attended three of these<br>community consultations and I read<br>because I was in the policy sector as an<br>adviser the policy team sorry I then<br>read the reports that were written<br>thereafter and and in each one of these<br>reports the criticism that critique that<br>I heard of not only Corrections but the<br>wider criminal justice signal they<br>either were excluded they didn't appear<br>in those reports or they were reworded<br>that does to enable in my view the<br>department to answer the these<br>toned-down<br>altered critique from frequency of<br>preconceived suite of answers now just<br>so that I can take this away from just<br>criticizing Corrections that was<br>generally the consultative process that<br>all each one of the major crime control<br>institutions carried out during my 10<br>years in government and when I was it's<br>pretty quickly it used to really drive<br>us crazy because what because what would<br>happen you see is because we were we<br>were mandated under legislation to be<br>the primary adviser to government on<br>Marty issues so every one of these<br>ground these departments were now we're<br>told by cabinet by the administer don't<br>speak to Marty or Pacifico whoever about<br>key issues they would come to us and say<br>because you guys do going when I go<br>around and do organize all their Hui<br>first which we hate it because we it was<br>we were Hui hoppin okay on behalf of all<br>these other agencies and why was it<br>annoying<br>well you might you might say well this<br>your job actually it wasn't right our<br>job was actually critique there there<br>are the activities not to go around<br>holding their hands and doing all their<br>their consultative work for them but<br>while it was embarrassing was because<br>they generally their consultation was<br>this kind that I'm describing which was<br>not the MA here at that's pretty cool<br>kadhi and was certainly not the T kana<br>in relation to how we engage with with<br>communities anyway okay so that's one<br>one issue to basically what the iron<br>represented was the wholesale<br>importation of a process that was<br>developed in Canada okay into the New<br>Zealand context and what to me was a key<br>theme that ran through that<br>implementation when you read their<br>policy papers and implementation<br>processes that were put in place by the<br>policy managers and the policy workers<br>and corrections was a liberal use of<br>what I think most accurately can be<br>called oriental ization now I'm going to<br>I will I couldn't think of another team<br>or utilization of the social context<br>with regards the potential impact on the<br>process on Marty<br>for utilization is a wonderful concept<br>developed by the Palestinian social<br>theorist Edward Saeed in the late 1970s<br>and if Saeed he sadly passed away a<br>couple years ago he coined this term to<br>describe how the Portuguese the English<br>and everyone went into the Orient or<br>Southeast Asia couldn't be just couldn't<br>handle the fact that there were just so<br>many cultural contexts and languages and<br>that's created this overarching<br>one-size-fits-all ethnicity for want of<br>a better term the Orientals that makes<br>sense okay so let me explain this<br>importation exercise of ion came up<br>against one really particularly<br>significant policy problem us all right<br>we our treaty partners we have the right<br>to become sort not only to be consulted<br>but an actual effect for any type of<br>process like this when it's implemented<br>to be able to how to put this reflect<br>our social and cultural context yeah so<br>what they did was basically ignore that<br>and they oriental eyes that by basically<br>and I was in policy and meetings within<br>Corrections when senior managers were<br>turn around and go well if you look at<br>the<br>components of the Canadian exercise and<br>integrated offender management they did<br>research that show for example that the<br>integrated offender management process<br>worked really well<br>for black Canadians and so therefore it<br>should be okay for Marty this is what<br>Sayyed meant what Orientalism<br>in this case black to black Canadians<br>are colored Marty are colored so<br>therefore it'll work for Marty if you<br>think that I'm exaggerating a couple<br>years after this I'm called to a<br>presentation at MSD Ministry of Social<br>Development by a professor and<br>psychology from the United States who I<br>won't name to embarrass service to save<br>him the embarrassment cause he's still<br>working who was over here are selling a<br>recall of WEP around program site based<br>program for youth called multi-systemic<br>therapy some of you may have heard of<br>and during his presentation one of<br>Minister Tariana Turia staff went how do<br>you know that it's going to work for<br>Marty given that we actually really have<br>our own wraparound tikanga based systems<br>and he said well research tells us that<br>it works for African Americans and<br>Hispanics the fact that I've been<br>pointed out kind of different social<br>cultural and by the way you know kind of<br>colonial context anyway Carol that's<br>oriental ization sorry to you Keith<br>hopefully that makes sense yeah yeah and<br>also I think what reflected this<br>exercise poorly was what I caught was<br>the dominance of policy based evidence<br>policy based evidence and I'm going to<br>talk about this a little bit more in a<br>moment as opposed to now some of you<br>those of you especially who work with<br>government agencies will hear them talk<br>about an even social social support or<br>social delivery agencies you will hear<br>the term<br>evidence-based policy is yeah so we<br>develop policy based on empirical<br>evidence of the impact effect and what<br>work what the ion example provides us as<br>a I think one of the key issues that has<br>stopped us from being developing<br>effective interventions in this country<br>and that is in fact is often that's the<br>reverse the it's policy based evidence<br>okay and which basically their agencies<br>will decide or the politicians who<br>direct the agencies will decide I want<br>this policy yeah and the job of the<br>policy workers is to find the evidential<br>base to it when you are directed I want<br>this policy and I'll talk about a<br>classic example in a moment which is<br>boot camps yeah then you go and you<br>cherry-pick different types of policy<br>evidence to support your preconceived<br>politically directed crime control<br>just one more thing about I am I thought<br>this is a great story so I gotta tell it<br>I will a stood six months of Corrections<br>I couldn't handle it well they couldn't<br>handle me I think it was you know a<br>divorce by mutual agreement so I went<br>back to the pinnacle Kitty and when not<br>long afterwards a couple years later the<br>the department were getting really for<br>analysis and release of the first<br>tranche of data from its suite of<br>criminal genetic programs for those of<br>you don't know criminal genic programs<br>are those programs interventions based<br>around what I seen is the three or four<br>primary drivers of criminality all right<br>cognitive issues not me now to think<br>properly and reason yeah<br>drug and alcohol anger and you know<br>those kind of things right and so under<br>the alleges under the when they got all<br>millions of dollars from the government<br>the government see that's cool but after<br>a few years we want you to report back<br>on what you're doing what effect the his<br>right so while I was there they hadn't<br>announced and they've gotten these<br>experts in Andrews and Bont and all<br>these other experts and and criminal<br>genic needs and and development of those<br>types of programs from Canada United<br>States and I remember when I was here<br>they announced we've got the gold stamp<br>okay on our on our data gathering and<br>analysis program I love the size it's<br>pretty cool could eat and one of our<br>mates run up from Corrections and said<br>you got you guys need to know this but<br>the first tranche of the analysis of the<br>first suite of data came through and the<br>programs aren't looking too healthy in<br>fact straight thinking which was the<br>cognitive therapeutic program and one or<br>two others and in fact what though data<br>he said the initial data showing us is<br>that Marty that respect that received it<br>didn't receive these programs like the<br>control group yeah had lower reoffending<br>rates than the offenders that went<br>through the interventions yes and we<br>were like yeah so when's this going to<br>come out well it's not because and this<br>is I think sometimes leads to there's<br>all issue of policy based evidence as<br>well<br>they were forewarned by by someone's in<br>the psych unit in the psych policy unit<br>within Corrections at the time by a<br>number of marty staff and and in group<br>sorry and practitioners they brought in<br>on the advisory group<br>there was a possibility that these<br>programs as though have been imported<br>wholesale to suit from if you like much<br>better for one of a bit of team you're<br>eccentric Canadian paradigm would not<br>work and they ignored it they ignored<br>this critique as they did much of the<br>critique yeah and so we thought this was<br>great except that the the poor post-grad<br>student from the Clarie diversity that<br>they contracted to write this report and<br>did analysis suddenly found it taken off<br>them and see you later go over to one of<br>their policy wonks and head office to -<br>apparently reanalyze or as record at TPK<br>rewrite and hide right in anyway so<br>someone who i had no idea who it was<br>late one of the New Zealand's first a<br>minute members of parliament the thought<br>I'd no idea who did that that this was<br>being hidden and there were questions<br>and the they could the correct the<br>criminal justice Select Committee and<br>suddenly this became knowing and they<br>they come forward and said yeah yeah<br>okay yep they may rename need to tweak<br>some of our programs okay may need to<br>tweak some of our programs there's a<br>point where I went into that story oh<br>yeah because not long after a year two<br>after this the department I can I'm just<br>I'm sorry I'm still in corrections and<br>really given my hammering why it's<br>important not only to my tea but to<br>those who work in the social community<br>service social service industry so to<br>speak well delivery of social services<br>in the community was a couple of years<br>later they wanted to corrections wanted<br>to look at if they could actually<br>centralized okay the service delivery<br>and at the time was been contracted out<br>to community groups that make sense and<br>so all sorts of weird and wonderful<br>things were happening like these far<br>north with some Maori providers up there<br>that suddenly found themselves having a<br>formative evaluation of their program<br>now a formative evaluation there's not<br>an outcome based evaluation there's one<br>where are you you know writing out your<br>monthly reports properly are you<br>tracking your customers and clients yeah<br>they don't tell you that the program's<br>actually reducing so you're offending<br>you know the big target<br>and insert and then found on the basis<br>of these formative evaluations because<br>there was a few problems they suddenly<br>lost their contracts and what-have-you<br>which I thought was totally unethical<br>because they should have been based on<br>whether or not they were actually you<br>know reducing harm and all the rest of<br>these major ones anyway<br>a couple years later I was at a<br>gathering similar to this and there was<br>a panel and it was some senior managers<br>from Corrections were defending this<br>practice and how these because they were<br>challenged by a number of particularly<br>Marty community providers about how<br>they'd lost their funding and this<br>policy manager yelled out said well you<br>know you failed the evaluation so I<br>responded to say well actually they<br>refold they they had pricked issues with<br>a formative evaluation we have evidence<br>a couple years ago that your programs<br>weren't working so when are you guys<br>going to stop using them and hand back<br>the 50 million or so that you've had the<br>last five years and of course the answer<br>was it's not the same thing said well<br>you know we've got like she got more<br>substantive evidence that you're<br>straight thinking and other cognitive<br>therapeutic programs were doing harm to<br>Marty we're not working as well right so<br>how come there's one rule for you and a<br>rule for everyone else okay so the rise<br>of this example of giving of eye on an<br>integrated offender management coincided<br>with a revolution within New Zealand's<br>policy sicker okay which was we're in<br>science and evidence became the basis<br>were supposed to become the basis for<br>policymaking this is the evident<br>evidence-based policymaking that I spoke<br>of earlier<br>okay this was supposed to to frame the<br>development of effective interventions<br>and to guide cabinet that the<br>department's and cabinets to make<br>decisions about we could put their<br>resources yeah we need to put their<br>putea their money our money all right<br>well at least that's what the policy<br>sector told itself and everyone else<br>okay and the public from the early 2000s<br>onward now quite often in my experience<br>this has not been the case with<br>pertinent evidence being either totally<br>ignored or the evidence that suits<br>appreader<br>and policy outcome favored over you know<br>the messy stuff like for example<br>evidence that contradicts the cabinet<br>or that highlights the negative impact<br>of government social and economic policy<br>yeah so and the recent classic example<br>of this was the resurrection while the<br>previous government of boot camps you<br>will know about boot camps militarist<br>extolled programs for youth offenders<br>when this idea was mooted<br>in the late 2000s there were no firm<br>evidence existed and any Western<br>jurisdiction to indicate that this<br>intervention actually results in<br>positive outcomes but you excuse me but<br>it was implemented regardless why you<br>may ask I'll tell you because the<br>minister one of them and the minister in<br>the national government at the time<br>wanted to look tough on crime all right<br>I wanted to appeal to to our fear of<br>young people in all of youth youth out<br>of control etc you know these kind of<br>myths that surround your culture in<br>Western countries like ours okay so in<br>other words you know the answers are why<br>wasn't implemented was one populist pop<br>politics and secondly ideology this goes<br>completely against the claims by policy<br>sector and even some Parliament's<br>politicians that they were only fund or<br>implement evidence-based interventions<br>okay and yes sometimes this does happen<br>I say actually probably is the is the<br>most common policy process the problem<br>is and this across the social sector and<br>in criminal justice<br>it is often because it is so because<br>crime social harm is so political and<br>it's a fantastic vote winner okay this<br>policy based evidence process happens<br>far too often and far more they would<br>say than other areas or other policy<br>sectors like health and education and<br>have you yeah so to understand how such<br>a poorly performing crime control<br>intervention such as boot camps could<br>actually be end up being introduced you<br>have to<br>ignore the rhetoric that we hear from<br>Wellington that New Zealand's often that<br>New Zealand's policy sick there is a<br>political there it's neutral okay and<br>that policy decisions are always often<br>based on scientifically derived evidence<br>this is not not the case in the sector<br>the introduction of bootcamps was purely<br>ideological of the get tough on crime<br>bring back military-style discipline for<br>those young thugs and good thrashing<br>never did me any harm kind of approach<br>to social policy and in relation to the<br>correction of youth offenders now to<br>their credit the Ministry of Justice<br>officials at this time provided the<br>administer with a thorough briefing one<br>that highlighted the lack of evidence<br>that the intervention would in fact make<br>us safer and reduce youth offending burn<br>under less the minister moved forward<br>with the policy and he actually wrote on<br>a blank at the moment I can remember his<br>name he's not a parliament anymore he<br>actually noted on it simply that he had<br>received but not read the briefing yeah<br>and and I'm not this is evidence this is<br>you can actually get a copy of it<br>through the OIA the Official Information<br>Act and you can read this I'm making<br>this point cuz I might sounds just<br>superfluous or superficial but it's<br>actually important he's given a briefing<br>by his own in ministry which in my view<br>and my experience is quite a<br>conservative policy shop in relation to<br>crime control who I think when I read<br>their report didn't actual effect a<br>fantastic job of pointing out the<br>evidential issues with this policy and<br>he does that Dean's are not worth<br>reading why because he already made up<br>his mind there's the decision this is<br>political okay this problem the tires as<br>the claims that come out of wanting to<br>know the political class okay that of<br>his evidence and science that drives<br>policy sector or policymaking in this<br>particular area so I wish to be clear<br>about our one thing at this point<br>sometimes evidence hairs does have a<br>significant impact on policy development<br>and implementation my argument here is<br>sometimes it does not and when it<br>doesn't it can actually be quite<br>damaging it can stop us from actually<br>creating effective interventions<br>and responses to social harm in to crime<br>but unsteadily I have to report and I'm<br>getting alone knob so some of you<br>obviously have experienced this through<br>your life experience all your jobs a<br>policy process can be and often is<br>highly political and ideological with<br>interventions and policies influenced as<br>much by who administer was drinking but<br>last week as it is on independent<br>empirical evidence I'm not being unfair<br>unkind and talking about politicians<br>that way because when the 2002 review if<br>you like of the sorry Sentencing Act<br>review of the sentencing that was being<br>carried out I was in a meeting the day<br>being very prominent labor minister of<br>government okay you may who's now a very<br>prominent politician in Auckland who are<br>not overheard I'm talking about two<br>things one is I was at the local RSA<br>last week there's no disrespect to<br>routine citizen please okay and one of<br>them suggested that's what a wonderful<br>idea want you to take that forward ideas<br>from all sections of the community are<br>welcome alright that was the forerunner<br>about seven eight years later to<br>national introducing boot camps okay<br>well the other thing that they said what<br>was the other thing he said are when<br>when I pointed out the impact of for<br>example taking away suspended sentences<br>which is one of the key drivers of our<br>significant increase has been perfectly<br>tested and now in prison muster he said<br>well the thing is anything that I<br>include in the 2002 Act must pass the<br>seem to porcini star anyone from the<br>sensible sentencing trust here I saw a<br>half hand someone yeah yeah that boy who<br>was the leader but just retired sorry<br>Garth McVicker yes I'm really sorry you<br>can tell that I've I have a<br>four-year-old who was annoying - hello<br>than me at three o'clock this morning<br>and - just come back a 1/2 years anyway<br>Garth II caught up the McVicker test<br>they said it's got a past them advocate<br>didn't pass the 20 quality scientists<br>but then we didn't matter because we<br>I'm realizing that I'm winning at a time<br>so I'm gonna go for a little bit so so<br>the policy sit well the political class<br>is biased yeah they're biased in terms<br>of they want your votes and they will<br>say and do whatever it is to get those<br>votes and and then the stick that they<br>play on our fear the fear of the other<br>whether it be brown people poor white<br>people young people generally yeah but<br>the policy sector because they are so<br>and they have their own worldview they<br>have their theoretical paradigm that<br>drives their development their policy in<br>Corrections is the psychology of<br>criminal conduct highly individualized<br>you're eccentric kind of way of thinking<br>about how crime was social harm occurs<br>which is highly problematic to me<br>because it by its very nature turns<br>attention away from the social construct<br>yeah from wider and the impact on<br>individual contact of things like for<br>example the precarious economy that we<br>now have a yell of our young people are<br>going into jobs okay zero contract I<br>think they call them okay and which it's<br>very very difficult for them to earn<br>enough to eat and to put roofs over<br>their head yeah<br>these social structural drivers of<br>criminality and poor behavior or<br>whatever it is poor social outcomes okay<br>are not included or a downplayed in this<br>type of theoretical paradigm their<br>drives crime control policy in New<br>I'm trying to formulate an idea about<br>her explain what I see is the crux of<br>the problem and I've come up with this<br>concept of the policy bubble policy<br>bubble this is one of the things that<br>annoys me about the Kuna just the sector<br>itself and its behavior in terms of<br>development of policies I think a lot of<br>those what they tell us about what they<br>can actually we're trying to is actually<br>quite deceitful in many ways ok there<br>are a number of issues and factors that<br>play a role I think in the overall poor<br>quality of policies and interventions<br>that are sometimes produced by the<br>policy industry and crime control sector<br>and combined they result in this thing<br>that I call the policy bubble and what<br>does this bubble this this relates to or<br>occurs from the exaggerated claims of<br>success by the sector and the in the<br>face of a little inevitable catastrophic<br>failure of policy and interventions all<br>right<br>I'm greatly exaggerating what they're<br>doing what they're doing<br>you want me to desert to basically not<br>exaggerate as they are telling you one<br>story knowing full well that they're not<br>going to reduce make you safer ok the<br>current control sector of itself will</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
