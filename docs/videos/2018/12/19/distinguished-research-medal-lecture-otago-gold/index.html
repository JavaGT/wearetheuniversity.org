cura colleagues guests<br>friends of the University of Otago<br>vice-chancellor deputy vice-chancellor<br>Pro Vice Chancellors heads of department<br>and of course our distinguished speaker<br>tonight<br>professor Dave crore from the Department<br>of Geology it's a real pleasure to be<br>able to welcome you here tonight for<br>this the distinct 2018 distinguished<br>research middle lecture my name is<br>Richard Blakey I'm the deputy vice<br>chancellor for research and enterprise<br>and it's great to be here to share and<br>celebrate this the award of our most<br>highly esteemed research research<br>distinction that we will have the order<br>of proceedings being an introduction of<br>the speaker the distinguished research<br>middle lecture and then we'll and after<br>the presentation of the middle by the<br>vice-chancellor we'll have a small<br>opportunity to share with you and some<br>refreshments at the staff club we have<br>professor Krauss head of department<br>James White here to give a formal<br>introduction for the lecture outlining<br>the details of his career and<br>achievements that have led to this award<br>but as I chair the panel that advises<br>the vice-chancellor on the award of the<br>distinguished research medal annually<br>I'll first give you a brief introduction<br>as to the nature of the war the award<br>and the kind of distinction that is<br>needed in order to get this our highest<br>research accolade our regulations state<br>that the University of Otago<br>distinguished research medal award aims<br>to give recognition to outstanding<br>performance of individual researchers a<br>medal commemorating the award will be<br>presented to each recipient at a public<br>lecture given by the recipient tonight<br>and I'm sure Dave will be able to let<br>you see the middle which actually I<br>should say we've had a new middle struck<br>this year as part of our refresh that I<br>the basis for selection will be<br>outstanding scholarly achievement<br>including the discovery and<br>dissemination of new knowledge the<br>development of innovative technology or<br>the development of concepts that lead to<br>a significant advances and activities in<br>the university these are very very high<br>standards to set and we don't we aren't<br>required to make an award every year but<br>in this case we though panel felt that<br>Dave's nomination certainly met all of<br>those standards now what happens is all<br>of the academic departments and<br>divisions are invited to bring forward<br>nominations and submit portfolios from<br>their best and brightest researchers and<br>we seek views of others to help guide<br>our decisions we get independent<br>referees reports solicited by the<br>nominators that then come in and I have<br>the the most difficult task to chair a<br>panel that includes previous<br>distinguished research medal winners to<br>try and select from all of the breadth<br>of disciplines that we have which of the<br>nominees best meets the award criteria<br>and what makes this special is actually<br>Dave tonight you join a very exclusive<br>club we very rarely award more than one<br>distinguished research medal sometimes<br>it will go to two recipients we run like<br>for example the Nobel Prize there might<br>be in any one discipline three Awards in<br>any one year so we have to select one<br>recipient across all of our disciplines<br>rather than making awards in individual<br>disciplines we have to balance overall<br>career-long scholarly achievement with<br>the discrete world-changing discoveries<br>that are often sufficient for other<br>awards so just one discovery is not<br>sufficient it has to be a significant<br>career level achievement so putting the<br>scale of the exercise in context we have<br>at the university of otago approximately<br>1600 research active staff who would be<br>eligible for this award and with only<br>one distinguished research medal awarded<br>each year since 2004<br>only around a dozen and a half<br>recipients of this award in the club<br>that you were joining Dave so that<br>represents about one percent of our<br>Academy consider also that to be<br>appointed to be an academic or a<br>researcher at the University of Otago is<br>also highly selective we can typically<br>get more than 100 applications for any<br>one position so that's another one<br>percent selection so in there your one<br>percent of a one percent but even<br>getting to the level of a PhD where you<br>are suitably qualified even to apply for<br>one of our positions that's about<br>another 1% exercise so here we are<br>tonight to celebrate the 1% of the 1% of<br>the 1% so in Dave you are officially<br>tonight the smartest person in New<br>Zealand smarter City or in most<br>beautiful city and I hope that you're<br>able to dine out on that fact very well<br>tonight<br>and at least for the next year that you<br>can claim that because I say that it<br>must be true so as a final remark before<br>we hand over to piece of white for the<br>formal introduction one thing that's<br>special about your wor award tonight is<br>its link to one of our founding<br>professors that I want to make professor<br>James Gael black it was also a geologist<br>and a chemistry and our inaugural and<br>professor of Natural Sciences and for<br>James black the practical application of<br>science was the central focus of his<br>career in his introductory lecture at<br>the opening of the university's second<br>session in May 1872 our calling to the<br>encyclopedia of New Zealand black<br>claimed that one of the aims of a<br>scientific education was an able to<br>enable a person quote to produce a pound<br>of corn or wool or iron or gold at half<br>the expenditure which had previously<br>cost and I'm looking for them tonight to<br>your lecture on Otago gold to see what<br>resonances and parallels there might be<br>with the views and the work of Professor<br>black coming close to 150 years ago<br>anyway RTI can a that's enough said from<br>me so from with so with that I will now<br>invite professor white to come forward<br>and provide the formal introduction<br>thank you very much<br>greetings and thank you all for being<br>here to listen to Dave you're not here<br>to listen to me so I'm going to keep<br>this fairly short Dave's been with us<br>for a long time and first came to Otago<br>is a his Bachelor of Science student and<br>that was in 1972 if I'm counting right<br>so 46 years he stayed for the BSC then<br>then left to went to Canada for a while<br>for his master's came back for PhD and<br>back to Canada for postdoc then he came<br>back here and he's been here with us for<br>over 35 years now in the Department of<br>Geology<br>is one of our mainstays significantly<br>longer than I've been here during that<br>time he's produced more than 300<br>publications a tremendous number of<br>those with students and many others<br>first authors so this is an amazing<br>achievement in earth science and he's<br>done that fault-finding time to to keep<br>up with his his joy of being outdoors so<br>he's a man who's keen on the wilderness<br>so he's managed to do the writing in<br>between finding finding time to go to<br>Patagonia Antarctica Baffin Island South<br>Georgia island the Canadian Yukon nanga<br>parbat Parbat and Tibet most of those<br>more than once not all of them his PhD<br>was on Mount aspiring national park and<br>this is the kind of PhD that we used to<br>do in geology a toe tag oh it was the<br>whole thing so 2,000 square miles three<br>kilometres of relief more than seven<br>accumulated months in the field for that<br>PhD all done within the PhD time period<br>so Dave's impressive and the other thing<br>that all of his nominators all of his<br>letter writers commented on is that that<br>he's changed the way that the world<br>looks at how gold moves around in<br>mountain belts how its extracted from<br>the earth moves with fluids and ends up<br>to be in hard rods or<br>sourced and he's done the same thing<br>again looking at how that gold is then<br>moved out of the mountains down into<br>alluvial gold where we can pick it up in<br>the rivers and rather than tell you more<br>in my words I'll give you a bit of an<br>outlaw and foot Dave's going to talk<br>about so he's going to tell us about<br>gold and gold mining from alluvial gold<br>which was the gold rush days that built<br>Dunedin through to modern mining which<br>is largely hardrock places like McRae's<br>he's going to talk about graphitic<br>carbon so black carbon metamorphic and<br>gold in mountain belts and how that how<br>that tells us about how we can mobilize<br>tiny amounts of gold and large amounts<br>of water bring him into the mountains<br>and turn them into a resource then he's<br>going to link those mountain sources<br>with alluvial gold and in his most<br>recent foray into that working with<br>other people has been using fish DNA to<br>do that so that's that's not a standard<br>approach to finding out how things moved<br>from the mountain into the basin so that<br>was as has been been a very productive<br>line of research that's that's unique to<br>Dave and then he's going to tell us a<br>little bit about mine waste both is a<br>hazard and as a resource so the stuff<br>that we used to process we didn't get<br>everything out we can go back he'll tell<br>us more about that<br>and one of the one of the things that<br>makes that possible is biology so he's<br>going to also talk to us about bacteria<br>and gold and bio leaching I think I'll<br>let Dave tell you now thank you<br>well thanks very much James it was very<br>flattering and yeah you could have given<br>the talk for me actually yeah you were<br>doing very well I I have a whole lot of<br>different directions that I go along<br>with with research and I work with a<br>whole lot of different people so the<br>talk tonight will involve moving around<br>all over the place I'm afraid I'll have<br>to jump around but the first but I'll<br>talk about history because we've got a<br>university that's got one hundred and<br>fiftieth anniversary next year and the<br>gold has been very important for that<br>and then the end of the talk I'll talk<br>about the future the present and the<br>future so that that's the aim for the<br>beginning in the end and in the middle<br>of the talk I'll do a lot of the things<br>that James just said I'll talk about a<br>whole lot of different directions and<br>they're sort of interconnected but I'll<br>have to hop around all over the place so<br>the first question that people ask me<br>all the time because mining is there<br>sort of a dirty word in society nowadays<br>and I'm quite happy to be a socially<br>outcast and that's just the way it is I<br>enjoy that and mining is a good place to<br>be from that point of view but why do we<br>mined gold it's because people want it<br>it's as simple as that really the people<br>ask me this question all the time it is<br>an amazing metal and it was the first<br>metal we come across way back way way<br>back 7,000 years ago well there abouts<br>the first metal we started to use<br>instead of stones and you can see on the<br>right there I mean that's not a bad days<br>work for somebody nowadays and five<br>thousand years ago that's pretty<br>impressive gold is really easy to deal<br>with from that point of view it's got a<br>huge number of different uses and you<br>can see here<br>it's getting more and more uses<br>sometimes somewhere between 10 and 20%<br>goes into the computers and cell phones<br>you've got these cell phones there and<br>you can see that the bit that Jim is<br>holding there is that doing our little<br>bit for the cell phones 170,000 phones<br>can be made out of that bar or 50,000<br>laptops and cars nowadays that computers<br>on wheels so that's why we mind gold and<br>going to Otago they get the link with<br>Otago the top live picture there Dunedin<br>1860 2000 population a real Mickey Mouse<br>one-horse town there's the horse<br>actually put up the one-horse town and<br>one year later completely transformed<br>into a gold rush City and if you want to<br>know what it was like Ellen the captain<br>has done a really good job she she<br>captured the atmosphere Oh a gold fields<br>environment it was sitting nicely on the<br>west coast but it could have been<br>anywhere in Otago Dunedin does get a<br>look in that book and it was a very<br>unpleasant place nine years after that<br>picture was taken<br>they set up a University and it was the<br>cache that came through that gold rush<br>that set up this university it didn't<br>come to the site didn't have those<br>buildings at the time but very soon<br>afterwards they started to build the<br>university and it's just been growing<br>and growing ever since I started my<br>career torn between the School of Mines<br>which was originally opened in 1879 and<br>the geology department which grew out of<br>the School of Mines in 1916 and I was<br>torn between the two walking backwards<br>and forwards across their quadrangle the<br>School of Mines closed and so I stayed<br>so getting to the gold world<br>this is Otago gold just put into some<br>kind of context this is the production<br>that we've had in cubes that's the<br>amount that we've produced over the last<br>150 years or they're about 160 years the<br>top cube they're eight million ounces<br>came out of historic mining this was the<br>gold rush and all the mining that came<br>afterwards and almost all of it that was<br>the alluvial gold in the river gravels<br>and more than 95 percent of it<br>nowadays since 1990 this a gold mine<br>which I'll talk more about the McRae's<br>mine not far from here and more than 95%<br>of the gold that's coming out over the<br>last 30 years or so it has been from<br>that environment so there's the two<br>different types of gold and I'll be<br>talking about both of those all right so<br>in a tall start start with alluvial gold<br>the gold rush everybody in this room at<br>some stage make a pilgrimage down to<br>Gabriel's gully where the the Gold Rush<br>started it's a doc reserve now and so<br>I'm not allowed to take students there<br>in gold panning anymore but it was a<br>good place in the past for field trips<br>so that's where it all started<br>it was the particularly sedimentary unit<br>that the river gravels they're the<br>largest production from a single deposit<br>in Otago and it's still the largest<br>deposit in Otago and the reason it's<br>still there it was called the Blue Spurs<br>Ament<br>by the miners it's old it's very old<br>it's the oldest gravel that we have<br>still preserved in Otay go and it's been<br>cemented by groundwater so it's very<br>very hard to work and as a result of<br>that there's quite large deposits of it<br>still where so it's 80 million years old<br>and that's from the time when we were<br>still attached to Australia so it's sort<br>of it's Australian Gold if you like this<br>is what the gold looks like these are<br>gold flakes that have been hammered in<br>the river hammered out flat the the one<br>on the left is so thin that it's<br>starting to get looking mathy it's it's<br>got holes in it and the one on the right<br>has been hammered so much that it's<br>folded and folded and folded and then<br>flattened again so that's what the gold<br>looks like it's about a millimeter or or<br>there abouts and it's scattered not very<br>liberally through the rock this is what<br>it looks like now when it's being made<br>in the river and it's what it looks like<br>when it's been taken out that the<br>processes are exactly the same the gold<br>extraction process haven't changed<br>significantly since were the Greeks and<br>before the Greeks certainly the Romans<br>took this to industrial scale 2,000<br>years ago around the Mediterranean and<br>further north so things haven't changed<br>very much since and this is exactly how<br>a river works in the natural environment<br>so you have lots of water moving a lot<br>of gravel and the gold because it's very<br>dense<br>what will accumulate and you can see<br>that at the end of the red arrow it's<br>just accumulating those that the little<br>flakes there along that riffle within<br>the the gold savings system one of the<br>notable things there is the muddy water<br>and this is one of the things that has<br>been in the news it's been in the<br>attacker Daily Times almost regularly<br>since the Tiger Daily Times started at<br>the beginning of the gold rush and that<br>is that the farmers and the other people<br>complained about the miners putting<br>muddy water into the river and there's a<br>miner who has just I think he's closing<br>down now he was<br>tackling this material very bravely and<br>he couldn't keep control of all the<br>muddy water there's a picture of Gemma<br>over a gun boots in the mud it is just<br>phenomenal now the picture on the top<br>left is during the gold rush they didn't<br>actually mine this hard rock during the<br>gold rush they mined that the gold that<br>was liberated naturally downstream or so<br>that's looking down towards Laurence<br>from Gabriel's gully it's a it's a very<br>famous picture after they'd totally<br>stripped out that valley and all the<br>time they were sending mud down on to<br>their neighbors and so it must have been<br>an incredibly unpleasant place to be<br>but after they'd done all of that they<br>started working into that hard rock and<br>it got even muddy so it was a pretty<br>unpleasant sort of environment that<br>muddy sediment contains some gold and a<br>lot of that has been reworked and<br>reworked and reworked ever since and<br>that a reworking that's what I used to<br>take students to go and do we can't do<br>anymore all right so we've got this<br>large deposit of gold<br>Gabriel's gully down near the clue the<br>river they're down there Laurence and<br>the question that was asked at the time<br>and has been asked constantly ever since<br>as where does all of this gold come from<br>and it's sort of embarrassing for me to<br>sit here with the senior university<br>management and admit that they've been<br>paying me for 35 years and I still can't<br>and all I can do now is explain why so<br>we got Gabriel Scully down there and<br>with the gold we find these distinctive<br>minerals you can see up on the top right<br>the left one is a garnet the right one<br>as a magnetite they're very distinctive<br>minerals only found in the central part<br>of Otago to the northeast and to the<br>north of Gabriel's gully<br>so we we know the gold came from up<br>there somewhere was that ten kilometres<br>or was it a hundred kilometres that we<br>don't know but a very common belief<br>amongst the gold mining fraternity over<br>the last hundred years and especially<br>over the last while is that because<br>McRae's deposit which I'm going to talk<br>about now it's the largest gold deposit<br>in otah go within the basement rocks<br>it's the other kind of gold in Otago<br>it's the largest deposit and therefore<br>it's likely that the gold came from<br>there across o-tar go to Gabriel's gully<br>and you can see that the river system<br>doesn't allow that to happen very easily<br>now so there's McRae's i've taken from<br>above it's a very large mine on a New<br>Zealand scale it's even on the radar<br>internationally that it's a world-class<br>mine something like 10 million ounce<br>resource totally although they may not<br>get all of that out they've produced<br>five million ounces over the last while<br>I showed that with the cube before and<br>importantly for trying to figure out<br>where the gold came from for the<br>Gabriel's gallery area the McRae's<br>deposit is about a thousand times bigger<br>than any of the other ones that we know<br>about so it's a pretty good pretty good<br>candidate it's quite a spectacular<br>structure it's a geological structure a<br>30 kilometer long gold bearing Fault<br>zone that goes all the way from up near<br>Hyde all the way to Palmerston and this<br>is just a small<br>portion of it that I've got there what<br>does it look like you look at the rock<br>the rock is just which used to be<br>sedimentary rock but it's been buried<br>quite deeply ten to fifteen kilometers<br>or at least and temperatures about 400<br>degrees the processes I'm talking about<br>happened to be 140 million years ago so<br>that was a long time before Gabriel's<br>gully formed we're talking deep time now<br>and you can see the white bands going up<br>through there with the arrows that's<br>where the water the hot water moved<br>through the rock removed those were<br>fractures at the time the water was<br>moving through the rock and transporting<br>some gold arsenic and iron and other<br>elements the yellow bits that you can<br>see there that's false gold so that<br>fooled you didn't that that's not gold<br>the those sulfide minerals pyrite and<br>asuna pyrite and they pervade the rock<br>they were brought in during that hot<br>water process ten kilometres down so<br>it's way down all right and that's what<br>the gold looks like this is now looking<br>at microscopically this is looking<br>inside one of those four pieces of<br>fool's gold<br>and you can see that I've ringed a whole<br>lot of them those are the real thing<br>there's a whole heap of them there and<br>they're about a micron a few microns<br>across they are tiny so they're<br>distributed right through those sulfides<br>and those sulfides are distributed<br>through the rock very very hard to get<br>this out and I'll talk about getting it<br>out later but the first thing that<br>you're gonna tell me is well that's only<br>micron across and the stuff in Gabriel's<br>gully is a millimeter across obviously<br>the gold<br>Gabriel's gully didn't come from the<br>Krays but it's not that simple there's a<br>zone just below the surface<br>all over Eastern oh and Central Otago<br>where the rock has been altered by<br>groundwater it's clay altered and<br>oxidized so all of that Brown is<br>basically rust it's oxidized iron and<br>within that the gold has moved around in<br>solution this is low temperature and<br>mobility of gold in the top 20 to 50<br>meters and this zone has been very<br>important historically for the miners<br>the small amount of the hard rock wall<br>schist derived gold that was extracted<br>historically was from tunnels like this<br>people digging along the gold bearing<br>zones and pulling out gold they couldn't<br>save that tiny gold whenever they got<br>through this brown stuff they got into<br>the the tiny gold and they stopped and<br>this is a worldwide problem that was<br>around certainly right through the 1800s<br>and into the 1900s getting the tiny gold<br>out of these deposits was essentially<br>impossible so this is the gold that they<br>were finding as a result of the the<br>groundwater movement the oxidation<br>process the clay alteration all of the<br>chemical processes that were going on<br>was also moving gold around and instead<br>of having those tiny bits we had<br>accumulation of a smaller number of<br>larger bits of gold and that's what they<br>look like and lo and behold they're<br>about a millimetre across actually some<br>of them get quite big those are quite<br>nice but we don't see very many of those<br>and obviously they're not going to<br>travel very far some of the some of<br>those are this big<br>they're quite spectacular so those are<br>Nuggets ohto go by and large is not a<br>nugget II sort of place mostly that the<br>gold is very fine but every now and<br>again we come across these rather<br>once the top left one and the top right<br>one I've asked the vice-chancellor<br>bluffer ears now I bought with beer well<br>getting back to University history you<br>can see that on the map there up near<br>McRae's yeah there was a another area<br>where there is a small amount of this<br>similar sort of gold and it was on the<br>beer would run the beer would run was<br>given to the University as an endowment<br>when it was set up and it was for<br>farming and the university rented it out<br>to some poor cocky who was farming a<br>very small number of sheep and a very<br>large number of rabbits and I don't<br>think they made very much money of that<br>at all<br>but there was one of these gold deposits<br>discovered on it and there was a lot of<br>excitement and even when I first started<br>my job there was the odd chick coming<br>across my desk from the beer wood mining<br>company they were still having to pay<br>royalties though they weren't producing<br>much in the way of gold they weren't<br>actually producing any gold but they had<br>to pay to have the rights continue I<br>don't the university sold the land a<br>while back and so those checks stopped<br>coming I think they probably made call a<br>lot of money out of the land and that<br>was very sensible so what was the story<br>there you can see in the bottom left<br>there's a you probably can't see it but<br>there is a grain of gold there that is<br>about half a millimeter or there abouts<br>and that's the sort of gold that was<br>found in the brown oxidized zone that's<br>a cross-section there showing where they<br>had their shafts going down and just<br>like it from a crash they got down to<br>the bottom of that brown stuff and that<br>was it and so no more real royalty<br>checks came to the University it was all<br>over so that was probably a university<br>of otago only mining venture and it was<br>all right so we're moving on there we've<br>still got this problem that we've made<br>some gold that big enough to get from<br>McRae's to Gabriel's gully but the river<br>system nowadays is not right how do you<br>figure out how rivers move how they<br>change there's our two main rivers in<br>Otago the the clue Thur and the tire II<br>the clue thir is a very long river that<br>goes all the way from the main divide to<br>the on the west to the sea and the East<br>and the tire II has this convoluted<br>Easter Otago course that starts you can<br>stand actually at the airport look out<br>the window and you can see the head of<br>the tyree River that's going to go for<br>250 kilometres and end up just outside<br>the other window they're both the same<br>length crazy and it from the gold point<br>of view one of the notable things about<br>the tyree River even though it flows<br>right past the largest bedrock gold<br>deposit and otah go that the currently<br>active mine at McRae's is overlooking<br>the tyree River the tyro River has<br>almost no gold<br>most of the golden Oh Louisville gold in<br>Otago is in the clue Thur system so it's<br>an interesting conundrum how can we sort<br>that out well this is now looking south<br>we're flying above the many a toto we're<br>looking south into the upper tyree River<br>and over into the clue the river and see<br>McRae's yeah on the bottom left and<br>gabriel's and the center at the top and<br>this is how we figure out well this is<br>one of the ways that we figure out how<br>rivers have changed over<br>time one of the good things about Otago<br>is that we have a zoology department and<br>within the zoology department we have<br>geneticists John Waters and Graham<br>Wallace and what what they have shown is<br>that there is there's a fish there<br>there's two species there's one in the<br>Colusa catchment galaxias Tveit up there<br>and there's one and the Tyree catchment<br>galaxias depressor SEPs and they used to<br>be in reproductive continuity not only<br>can they tell us that but they can give<br>us an estimate of how long it was since<br>they stopped being in reproductive<br>continuity and that's something like<br>half a million years give or take a bit<br>it's pretty rough but what it means is<br>that those hills in-between Galaxia<br>stevia and the the many a tow-rope lane<br>there those hills have come up over the<br>last half a million years and lo and<br>behold even I as the geologist can tell<br>the difference between Cheston and<br>greywacke and we found very distinctive<br>rocks that only found the north end of<br>the Menier Tonto<br>we found them over the other side of<br>that hill with the fish so there's no<br>doubt that at one stage the tyree River<br>in the upper Tyra River which now flows<br>to the north it used to flow towards the<br>south and this is a reconstruction that<br>call it the khyber and now the Clyburn<br>comes down and Joy's joins the atari<br>river at coking and the ancestral Coburn<br>used to go all the way from the<br>northeastern side of Otago all the way<br>down to the the clew the river and at<br>that time this is the middle of million<br>years ago it was taking all of the gold<br>and appositive met quite a lot of it in<br>that yellow circle which I'll talk about<br>it in a moment but that gold was<br>stripped out of the headwaters of the<br>tyree and in the general vicinity of<br>mccrane's and taken down now you can see<br>why I've been incompetent for the last<br>35 years is that this was a complicated<br>story to unravel and this is only one<br>million years maybe two at the most<br>now we're going to unravel the other 78<br>million years to try and figure out how<br>the gabriel's Gally things formed we we<br>can't really do that all we can do is<br>make guesses that these sorts of<br>processes were going on at the time yeah<br>the island got island block goldmine<br>just a lot of people have been past that<br>it's the top left there and one of the<br>notable things about it the road to<br>Alexander drives right beside it one of<br>the notable things about it is that you<br>can't see that it was a gold mine one of<br>my contemporaries nor Becca is part of a<br>small group of people in New Zealand who<br>have developed quite spectacular way of<br>making environmentally benign but very<br>productive alluvial gold deposit gold<br>mines within this sort of environment<br>and one of the challenges that they<br>meant almost all the time is that the<br>rehabilitated land should be more<br>productive than it was originally so<br>what they do they have a thing which is<br>sort of a floating processing plant it's<br>a more sophisticated version of when I<br>showed before<br>the mine put looking up in the top right<br>the mine pit is advancing in the<br>direction of the yellow arrow and the<br>tailings the processed material was<br>dumped out the back and then it's<br>bulldozed around and the sheep were<br>planted so this is a very effective way<br>of keeping the muddy water on site and<br>getting around that problem that I<br>mentioned before was what<br>in the attacker daily times on a regular<br>basis but for well over a hundred years<br>so it's a very good system Noah Becca<br>was responsible both for the island<br>block went up there with all of the<br>tyree River gold that got swept down but<br>he's got the act of one now in Southland<br>just looking at that processing thing it<br>looks very much like a dredge the<br>historic dredges they were developed in<br>Dunedin they were invented in Dunedin<br>and lots of them dozens of them were<br>operating all over Otago but over a<br>hundred years ago<br>120 years ago and the concept was taken<br>all around the world Doug McKenzie and I<br>have worked in the Yukon and they've got<br>a spectacular one there it's a typical<br>Otago dredge sitting up there for the<br>tourists to go and see it's one of the<br>better preserved one so these things<br>that were taken from Dunedin from the<br>Gold Rush world and taken all around the<br>world okay so we've got a pile of gold<br>there on the bottom right millimeter<br>sized gold flakes I keep on talking<br>about those they're the easiest ones for<br>the miners to extract well very uniform<br>grain size and that's because the finer<br>gold they can't keep it just gets washed<br>away and it's very very difficult for<br>them to approach this net so fortunately<br>we have a world full of bacteria and the<br>bacteria are on the side of the miners<br>so top left there there's some typical<br>millimeter sized flakes very thin but if<br>you look very closely on the surface you<br>can see that the bacteria have been busy<br>looking at the bottom left there they're<br>making these little wormy and blobby<br>bits of gold that are on the surface so<br>what they're doing is part of the same<br>sort of process that I was describing<br>before<br>for the oxidized zone within the<br>mineralized rocks that McRae's the<br>bacteria are moving the gold around<br>depositing gold to make a smaller number<br>of larger particles and every micron<br>counts in this sort of situation the the<br>bacteria need to be fed as we all do and<br>on the right there you can see we've got<br>a woody material that is very commonly<br>within the sediments and when the<br>bacteria are active they leave behind<br>these iron sulfide that they're called<br>Fram boyd's which is basically raspberry<br>like except that unlike a nice juicy<br>raspberry these things are only a few<br>microns across but these are bacteria li<br>deposited on salt also iron sulphides<br>pyrite Fool's Gold that forms in<br>association with a lot of these<br>processes in at the bottom of rivers and<br>within the river gravels after they've<br>been deposited this is an experimental<br>study that was done by a group that I<br>work with but I wasn't part of this<br>study that this is totally a lab based<br>thing where they got some bacteria and<br>they fed them some gold bearing water<br>just to see what would happen if you fed<br>bacteria some gold bearing water well it<br>allows very heavy on the stomach there's<br>what it boils down to they don't like it<br>and so they kick it out and so this is<br>the result these are bacterial gold poos<br>and this is what they do they've just<br>got to get rid of it out of the<br>assistance some of them put it into<br>their cell walls and these ones put it<br>right out and the notable thing is that<br>they make these triangular and hexagonal<br>crystals gold actually makes cubic<br>crystals well very variations on cubes<br>but the bacteria are great at making<br>these very thin hexagonal crystals and<br>also not little blobs and things so my<br>role in talking to these people that I<br>collaborate with they said well this is<br>what we do in the lab can you go out and<br>find that in the real world and of<br>course we can this is central otago<br>there's quite a spectacular piece of<br>hexagonal gold adhering to the outside<br>of one of the flakes within Central<br>Otago and a whole lot of other crystals<br>and irregular blobs so there we go<br>larger scale than the other ones that's<br>quite big gold poos so I want to take<br>the bacterial story a little bit further<br>and I should confess now I actually know<br>almost nothing about bacteria but I'm<br>learning and I really enjoy learning<br>because the the microbiologists got a<br>lot to tell us so in the top left that's<br>just something I stole off the internet<br>to show you what it looks like when<br>bacteria are actively making one of<br>these raspberries one of these friend<br>boys they're sitting there they're doing<br>their whatever they do all day which is<br>respirate and and so forth and the end<br>result of their life processes is to<br>deposit the iron sulphide the pyrite on<br>the right for their the big yellow one<br>there's a there's a friend Boyd and and<br>that one is 200 million years old<br>it's from the sediment that makes up the<br>oh cargo ships but it's the sediment<br>that hasn't been cooked like the Otago<br>shifts so this was formed on the<br>seafloor<br>at the time of deposition around about<br>200 million years ago these bacteria<br>were were active then and you can see<br>underneath that big yellow one we we've<br>got a more diffuse one and that's a<br>piece of a plant and the bacteria been<br>sitting inside the individual cells of<br>that plant fragment and depositing<br>pyrite<br>well it's not just pyrite and quite a<br>lot of work I've been doing with in<br>collaboration with some people in<br>University of Western Australia is to<br>look at these things in detail and and<br>we find that it's not just iron sulphide<br>it's a whole lot of other metals as well<br>and you can see on that bottom picture<br>that the different colors are pulled out<br>with a different technique the details<br>don't never but we've got pyrite which<br>is dominant<br>we've got spell right which is zinc<br>sulfide now we've got cobaltite which is<br>cobalt arsenic sulfide and all of these<br>things have a little bit of gold and<br>that's almost certainly gold that's put<br>into these things as gold poos exactly<br>like we were seeing in the river gravels<br>in the modern places in Otago it's<br>exactly the same sorts of processes and<br>a lot of that gold we don't know how<br>much but this is pure speculation<br>a lot of that gold probably came out of<br>seawater see one of the 13 minions our<br>milligram per liter lots of people in<br>the past of trying to extract gold from<br>seawater because they know it's a very<br>attractive concept but they've never<br>been able to do it in an economic way<br>but the bacteria can and they've been<br>doing it here so here we've got<br>localized gold enrichment within the<br>original sediments that made up the<br>otago shift the next stage is to take<br>that sediment and bury it a long way<br>down heat it up to 600 or there abouts<br>degrees Celsius maybe 20 or 15 or 10<br>kilometres down a long way down and<br>these lines are analyses of rocks from<br>different levels all the way down now<br>these are all exposed at the surface now<br>and you can see the arsenic shows it<br>very well the arsenic is about ten parts<br>per million in the way that the<br>low-temperature rocks by the time you<br>get to<br>high temperatures it's lost almost all<br>of its arsenic the antimony is B that<br>does a very similar thing and the gold<br>does a very similar thing they're not<br>quite spectacularly so this is how we<br>get the McRae's type of deposit we take<br>those little frame Boyd's with a little<br>bit of gold poo and some arsenic just<br>dispersed through them and we bury them<br>heat them up and start to move those<br>metals around and eventually they get<br>channeled through fault structures like<br>McRae's which I mentioned before it's a<br>30 kilometer long major fault zone and<br>the gold and the arsenic get deposited<br>along there as part of all of that that<br>we've got carbon the carbon is carbon<br>dioxide and methane are generated from<br>the organic material that I showed a<br>picture of before so all of this is<br>happening within what has happened<br>within this very thick sedimentary pile<br>that turned itself into schist the<br>carbon matters because you go to McRae's<br>and the place is just riddled with<br>carbon it's carbon in the form of<br>graphite which is the the most common<br>form of carbon it's used for lubricants<br>and and things like that and all of the<br>fault zone is just riddled with this<br>stuff it's closely associated with the<br>gold all through that fault zone it's<br>one of the carat characteristic features<br>the bottom right one there looks like<br>coal it it's actually got more carbon<br>than called pure graphite so graphite<br>has been a bit of an obsession with me I<br>wanted to figure out how that got there<br>and its relationship to the sort of<br>system that<br>been talking about so what do you do<br>you've got to go to some place in the<br>world where there's lots of carbon and<br>this is the the southern hemisphere and<br>an awful lot of that is limestone or<br>calcium carbonate bearing rock so that's<br>a very spectacular pile of carbon within<br>the growing mountain belt and as a<br>result of that all of that calcium<br>carbonate bearing Rock the limestone is<br>being buried underneath the the huge<br>mountains that are growing they get<br>buried down to ten to fifteen kilometers<br>or there abouts by the over thrusting as<br>the plate tectonic movement brings the<br>whole home a layer together that<br>generates carbon dioxide and the<br>chemical reaction is up there you just<br>take calcium carbonate a bit of quartz<br>and you get a calcium silicate and<br>carbon dioxide and the bottom left<br>there's hot springs with carbon dioxide<br>bubbling out lots of it and that's<br>reputed to be right along the himalaya<br>something like ten percent of the<br>natural carbon dioxide that's generated<br>by geology so let's go to the northern<br>tomorrow and it's a very different<br>situation we still got carbon but the<br>carbon is organic debris within Shaylee<br>rocks and that carbon<br>it's basically an oil forming<br>environment and so you bury that and you<br>generate methane and this particular<br>picture we've got the muktinath temples<br>here that there's a methane seep coming<br>out of the ground that's been burning<br>for a thousand years or more and it's a<br>sacred site for both Hindus and<br>Buddhists lots of people go there for a<br>pilgrimage to see the spring I've done<br>it himself<br>so in this part of the Himalaya the<br>carbon is dominantly methane you go in<br>between and you find that you've got<br>both those shales generating methane and<br>you've got limestone's berry generating<br>carbon dioxide and the two combine and<br>there's the chemical reaction at the<br>bottom there carbon dioxide and methane<br>giving you graphite<br>now that's stopping global warming just<br>by a very tiny little amount by a<br>natural process where precipitating<br>graphite that black colon looking stuff<br>that's along that active fault zone some<br>of that rock is half graphite it is very<br>very carbon rich well that's been<br>important for the structure of the<br>himalaya because that fault zone<br>spectacular one that goes right behind<br>the annapurna massif and because all of<br>that graphite is deposit along the fault<br>it's focused the fault movement on a<br>very narrow zone because that graphite<br>is lubricating it and as a result you<br>get that three kilometres high fault<br>scale the mountain would go up anyway<br>whether there was graphite or not but<br>what's happened is that the graphite<br>along the fault zone has localized the<br>movement and made that spectacular fault<br>scarp it's probably the largest highest<br>fault scar on earth so that graphite is<br>important that from the structural point<br>of view so can we look at that here it's<br>not so easy in the southern alps because<br>we don't have so much carbon i'm away a<br>great place to look at that because it's<br>full of carbon but along the Alpine<br>Fault zone we do have carbon dioxide<br>coming out and spring a little bit of<br>methane and bottom right corner there<br>little bits of graphite that's pretty<br>small this is not big chunky lumps like<br>there isn't Himalaya but the process<br>it is identical to what I've been<br>describing and within the Himalaya so<br>that we have graphite in fork rocks<br>active within the southern alps and<br>underneath the southern alps we have the<br>same sorts of processes going on adding<br>some gold and some arsenic and so we've<br>got this combination underneath the<br>southern alps of graphic rock with<br>sulphide minerals and end with gold<br>forming today these processes that I've<br>been talking about for 140 million years<br>ago to make the craze are going on today<br>underneath the southern alps and at the<br>bottom of the slide there you can see<br>that the graphite weakening rocks<br>facilitated the gold deposition it's<br>partly chemical that's partly physical<br>but the McRae zone there this is the<br>reds and oranges are where the best gold<br>are and gold accumulations are that<br>that's a long a 40 sorry a 30 kilometer<br>long zone as I said before all the way<br>from hide to palmerston and looking back<br>140 million years that was probably a<br>major structure that was causing<br>mountains wouldn't have been like<br>Annapurna but wouldn't be as impressive<br>as they're but nevertheless that<br>structure was important in the<br>topographic history early topographic<br>history of Otago so we're back to<br>McRae's I always come back to McRae's<br>just because it's close and I want to<br>switch direction now and talk about the<br>present in the future gold mine tailings<br>one of the notable things about gold<br>mines all over the world is that you<br>take about one gram out of a ton of rock<br>and the other or almost all of that<br>tongue goes out to tailings and that's<br>what those are and that's more than a<br>square kilometre<br>and it's a hundred meters deep that's an<br>awful lot of rock it's got about five<br>kilograms of accent per ton and we've<br>got to think of that as a resource it's<br>also an issue we've got to find some way<br>of looking after it but that figure<br>there in white five to ten percent of<br>global energy consumption goes in<br>crushing rocks and that's for stuff for<br>you every one of you<br>consumes something like 20 tons worth of<br>stuff it's mined for you every year<br>that's a huge amount of energy<br>so these tailings they're produced as a<br>renewable part of the mining process and<br>we've got to store them for a long time<br>in the old days there was no problem yes<br>threw them in the river and and they<br>were all gone and that in a way was a<br>lot simpler but nowadays we're not<br>allowed to do that so we have to store<br>them there Square Kilometre 100 metres<br>deep that's a lot of rock it's about 100<br>million tonnes just just to give you an<br>idea okay so what are we going to do I<br>deal with Cathy roof out who is an<br>ecologist and she's been trying for 20<br>years to teach me ecology and this<br>particular project we were out in the<br>snow in this particular day but trying<br>to find what will grow on tailings it's<br>not enough soil up there to cover this<br>square kilometer and if you can't cover<br>it then the wind comes along and blows a<br>snit all over the place and the<br>neighbors can play so trying to get<br>things to grow and what we found is that<br>the tailings raw rock just ground-up has<br>all the required ingredients to grow<br>plants nitrogen phosphorus potassium<br>salt<br>all these other things everything's<br>there but and one of the notable things<br>that came out of that was how high the<br>nitrogen is the the concept of nitrogen<br>and rocks was sort of a new thing but<br>McRae's or you'll see in the bottom<br>right there six you got quite high<br>nitrogen so a lot of environments like<br>this<br>it's the shortage of nitrogen that's the<br>problem here it's the shortage of<br>phosphorous there's actually heaps of<br>phosphorus in the rock but there's not<br>sorry it won't release fast enough from<br>the fresh or to allow plants to grow<br>easily so we ended up choosing this<br>particular species we try to hold a lot<br>of species it's a lot of fun really<br>going up and gardening whatever what we<br>found was that the fresh Rock doesn't<br>work all that great but if you put some<br>of that weathered rock there oxidized<br>rock the clay alter dropped that I keep<br>on talking about very important laying<br>you put that on and the next thing you<br>know you've got grass growing it's great<br>great stuff and they've got heaps of<br>that so it happened very quickly<br>after that and on the bottom left<br>there's implementation of the process<br>put a layer of that withered stuff on<br>orange stuff and they threw up it was<br>super on just in case but it works it<br>works very well very pleased with that<br>okay why does it work on the Left we've<br>got an oxidized rock and there's the<br>phosphate minerals the details don't<br>matter but on the right that orange rock<br>that you get at the surface the clay<br>alter dropped you get completely<br>different phosphate minerals phosphate<br>minerals are really really important in<br>New Zealand agriculture what we do is<br>bring shiploads of phosphorus phosphorus<br>bearing the<br>from West Africa a great political cost<br>and distributed around here and then we<br>send it to China as milk powder I mean<br>that's that's the process this is a<br>little bit more indigenous in that it's<br>not quite so phosphorous demanding so we<br>can cover these things with locally<br>sourced phosphorus bearing material and<br>the stuff dissolves relatively easily<br>now the top right picture there the<br>cerium lanthanum yet trium phosphates<br>you may not have come across these these<br>are called rare earth elements and they<br>matter and this is something I it was a<br>rather nice picture I got from New<br>Scientist this is the periodic table<br>according to smartphones so those things<br>you've got in your pocket now have got<br>all these elements and more and because<br>there are billions of them around the<br>world we having to extract an awful lot<br>of these things on the left-hand side in<br>the middle you can see the screen<br>there's those rare earth elements that<br>we've gotten those phosphate minerals<br>the Krays and we just put it over the<br>the tailings and growing grass on them<br>but we need those rare earth elements we<br>need all of these other ones so these<br>are potentially available from the<br>kraits tailings we can't get them out<br>yet but there is a potential resource<br>and in the future we're going to have to<br>do that for a whole lot of reasons the<br>most likely material that will come out<br>of the tailings is is tungsten because<br>there's a hundred times as much tungsten<br>as gold the price of tungsten is not<br>high enough to make it easy to extract<br>economically you can see in the bottom<br>left that the price fluctuates about<br>fivefold on<br>regular basis but it's an important part<br>and a growing part of modern technology<br>we need that stuff there's an awful lot<br>of the tungsten in the mineral she light<br>up in the crash and see it's glowing<br>purple in the dark<br>Doug Mackenzie's been doing quite a lot<br>of work on this in particular the reason<br>it's glowing purple with ultraviolet<br>light which is what it's doing there is<br>that it has rare earth elements in it<br>that help it to fluoresce like that so<br>if we could get the tungsten out we<br>could probably also make screens for<br>your smart phones all right so I've been<br>through all of this and I haven't told<br>you how we get the gold out of you know<br>that the tiny pieces out of the sulfides<br>and in the middle of that slide there's<br>a point that if you take the stuff and<br>crush it up some of the gold will come<br>out if you throw it into a cyanide<br>solution and that cyanide solution<br>approach has been around for a bit over<br>a hundred years it was developed in the<br>1890s and it spread around the world and<br>one of the main protagonists and a guy<br>who helped to develop it and spread the<br>word internationally and within New<br>Zealand that was Professor James Park<br>for the Otago School of Mines so he was<br>a great advocate of cyanide and the<br>process hasn't changed very much for the<br>last hundred and twenty years but to get<br>the gold to dissolve in cyanide you have<br>to liberate it from within inside these<br>other minerals and that is the battle<br>you can keep on trying to crush it finer<br>and finer and finer that takes an awful<br>lot of energy as I was pointing out<br>before so there's two pathways that are<br>followed one of them is the<br>high-temperature pathway on the left and<br>that's the one that they use it in the<br>Krays they heat it up they have high<br>pressure oxygen<br>they make an acid solution very low pH<br>and the the gold is liberated from the<br>sulfide minerals that way the other way<br>of doing it is the low-temperature<br>pathway it's called bio leaching it<br>works best in the thirties Celsius also<br>an acid solution and that uses that<br>particular bacterium it's a very popular<br>there acid Othar bacillus bureau ups<br>plants and that works very very well so<br>I'll talk about bioleaching in a moment<br>but just to mention in passing that you<br>can reprocess these tailings at once<br>McRae's they installed the pressure<br>oxidation system there's only about five<br>I think in the world it's a very<br>high-tech system they installed it in<br>1999 and and they reproach this their<br>old tailings and make money out of that<br>it was a very effective way of doing get<br>anymore but that was getting more gold<br>it wasn't getting any of these other<br>elements so the problem we have with<br>coming up with ways of getting these<br>elements now look at the figures they're<br>a hundred million dollar facility to set<br>up that pressure oxidation plant<br>top-of-the-line lot of research whatever<br>and all I got was an increase in 5% in<br>the gold recovery now 5% of 5 tonnes a<br>year for 20 years which now 5 tonnes of<br>gold so that's not a bad investment but<br>what they won't do in the commercial<br>environment is follow up on strange<br>ideas from pointy heads who work in<br>universities they they want to see<br>something that will actually work so the<br>final example I want to use is one that<br>that's got me fired up at the moment<br>just over the last couple of years<br>working with the microbiological people<br>in in Brisbane this is a copper gold<br>mine in<br>Brazil I haven't been over but it's a<br>cup of gold mine that's within a<br>national park in the Amazon rainforest<br>and I just wanted to wind people up by<br>pointing out that there's something like<br>four times as much copper in an electric<br>car as as there is in a standard car and<br>this is where your copper for your<br>electric car comes from the National<br>Park and the Amazon rainforest I hope<br>that makes you feel good<br>see you later Jim so they're producing<br>or to make your electric car copper and<br>a bit of gold to pay the bills and they<br>have an awful lot of rice crop and<br>tailings so the project is to try and<br>get extra copper and gold out of the<br>waste and over on the bottom right<br>we've got picture there of the problem<br>it rock has got lots of iron silicates<br>it's bit like the black rock that makes<br>up our clock tower not the white one<br>which is limestone it's the black one<br>and distributed within those iron<br>silicate so we just have little bits you<br>can see the the arrow bits there little<br>bits of yellow stuff that's copper<br>sulphide and there's gold inside that<br>copper sulphide so our problem is that<br>we've got gold inside copper sulphide<br>inside iron silicates and we want to get<br>all of that out how do we do it bags do<br>it with bags another problem we have in<br>this situation is that the pH of the<br>environment there is neutral very close<br>to neutral and the bugs that most people<br>use acidified bacillus vero oxidants<br>likes a pH of 3 or even lower but the<br>endemic ones I'll just go back a step<br>that the bioleaching that's often done<br>with that bacterium you just make it an<br>attest you you grow it in a test tube<br>stick it in to a big bucket a big bucket<br>that size of this room actually and let<br>let them work away but here the concept<br>is to use an endemic strain of the same<br>bacterium that has evolved to eat<br>silicate rocks at a pH of 7 so you have<br>to go out in the field and you get the<br>bugs there they've evolved to be quite<br>different they're not a different<br>species but they have a different<br>ecology from the their cousins that get<br>made in a lab and so there we can see on<br>the right pseudo thio vassilis eating<br>rocks and liberating the the copper<br>sulfide and the gold the tiny bits that<br>are encapsulated you can see on the left<br>there we've got an iron silicate tiny<br>little bit of pink copper sulfide and go<br>up in the corner and the bugs are eating<br>they're eating the rock and letting that<br>stuff out so on the left there you can<br>see how successful it is just over a few<br>weeks in the lab this is purely lab work<br>so far you can more than double the<br>extraction of copper from these silicate<br>rocks so this is just an example it's it<br>happens to be an example I'm fired up<br>about at the moment but we're going to<br>have to do a lot more about this this<br>sort of thing we need to become much<br>more efficient with resource extraction<br>because this transition that we're in<br>towards a low-carbon future is actually<br>creating more demand for resources the<br>amount of resources that we're using is<br>going up and a lot of those resources<br>are being generated with fossil fuels<br>and you know Tago we're lucky we can<br>produce gold with electricity and a bit<br>of diesel but a lot of these other<br>places around the world where meeting<br>your demand with fossil fuels in this<br>transition to a low-carbon economy so<br>there's major research topics but for<br>the future we're going to have to get<br>into this well I think it's great and<br>down at the bottom the take-home message<br>is something that I've learned over the<br>last 35 years is that on this campus<br>there's some really smart people outside<br>alright so that's just to thank you and<br>thank you Dave I have the unnamed evil<br>task of giving a vote of thanks and I<br>will I will not go through the many<br>threads and traces of what you said but<br>I will just highlight your point that<br>multidisciplinary researchers essential<br>and I think in what we've seen tonight<br>with your tour de force we can see that<br>though the world of the polymath is<br>still alive and well that in your own<br>research day like Professor Blake you're<br>not a geologist you're a geologist and a<br>chemist and more than him you're a<br>geologist and a chemist and a zoologist<br>and a botanist and a social scientist<br>you gave us a picture and a story of<br>those early days in Otago you took us<br>from the craze around the world and back<br>again and I think we can all reflect on<br>that actually I do have one little<br>social story just tell about my about<br>Gabriel's gully my grandfather and his<br>brother would go in their vacations from<br>their Southland farm and they would they<br>would extract gold from Gabriel's gully<br>they extracted in their youth enough for<br>one wedding band and though the first to<br>get married would get the gold for the<br>wedding band and that it was my<br>grandmother's wedding band out of<br>Gabriel's gully so I think we can all<br>link to a story from this and with that<br>I would like you all to join me to thank<br>now my pleasure before we retire for<br>refreshments the staff club to invite<br>the Vice Chancellor to come and present<br>you with the the middle and a<br>certificate<br>that ends the formalities please come<br>and join us at the staff club thank you</p></main><footer
