guitar widow<br>puma noah row bracket Adama tena koe toe<br>tena koutou tena tato katoa on behalf of<br>the University of Otago I would like to<br>warmly welcome you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor Jim<br>Carter as always it's fantastic to see<br>staff and students from around the<br>University here this evening and also<br>members of the Dunedin community who use<br>these inaugural professorial lectures as<br>part of their ongoing education welcome<br>to each and every one of you I'd like to<br>give a particularly warm welcome however<br>to the special people in Jim's life who<br>have come here to join in the<br>celebration and his promotion his<br>parents Marg and Ralph his brother Doug<br>and Doug's family his sister Louise and<br>her family his wife Kate and their<br>collective children Hamish Charlotte<br>Lucy and grace and I also understand<br>that a large number of Jim's friends are<br>also here and I welcome each and every<br>one of you now we're all collectively<br>gathered here whether we are Jim's<br>colleagues or his family or his friends<br>to celebrate his promotion to Professor<br>and I can honestly say that Jim has<br>seriously earned this promotion he's an<br>effective and popular teacher both in<br>the classroom and in the context of post<br>graduate supervision by way of example I<br>had the great pleasure of awarding Jim<br>the ous a supervisor of the Year award<br>in 2010 and I understand that two of<br>Jim's previous masters students Monique<br>and Terry have flown here from the<br>University of Wollongong specifically to<br>be here to support him in his IPL in<br>addition to his skills as a teacher Jim<br>is also an outstanding researcher he's<br>an international expert on extreme<br>endurance and as many of you know he's<br>an endurance athlete himself he<br>publishes his work in the best<br>international journals in his field and<br>when we were consulting on the<br>jarett's of jim's promotion one of the<br>referees referred to Jim as someone of<br>global excellence in his particular<br>field last but certainly not least Jim<br>is an outstanding citizen he's provided<br>excellent service to the school and to<br>the University more broadly Jim is<br>someone that I know that I can always<br>count on including to serve as a<br>graduation speaker which he will do in<br>December of this year so Jim on behalf<br>of the university of otago i would like<br>to warmly congratulate you on your very<br>well-deserved promotion to Professor<br>over the years I have personally not<br>only valued your teaching skill and your<br>research expertise and your service to<br>the University and the broader community<br>but I have always valued your extremely<br>positive attitude towards everything<br>that you do I honestly don't think I<br>have ever seen you without a smile on<br>your face<br>Namie he knew a kkeok way I will now<br>call on Professor Richard Barker the pro<br>vice-chancellor of Sciences to tell us<br>just a little bit more about Jim's<br>academic history noreda Tenneco totin<br>tonight way Vice Chancellor tena koi<br>professor Kota tena koi emeritus<br>professor booth friends and colleagues<br>tanaka tanaka tanaka Takata is my great<br>pleasure to introduce our speaker<br>tonight professor Jim kata to give his<br>inaugural professorial lecture at the<br>University of Otago as indicated by a<br>vice-chancellor professor kata is one of<br>our newer professors at the University<br>of Otago receiving his well-deserved<br>promotion to the position in February of<br>this year<br>born on the west coast into an<br>adventurous family professor Cotter<br>combined his long-standing interests and<br>endurance and academic prowess leading<br>to an undergraduate degree in Physiology<br>from the University of Canterbury he<br>then saw the light and moved south where<br>he undertook a Bachelor of physical<br>education Abby fed which was then<br>followed by an M feed in cold stress<br>physiology some of you will know and<br>some of you won't know that those oats<br>hago letters identified Jim as a fetter<br>and this is an extraordinary passionate<br>group of individuals who united by their<br>dedication to the study of physical<br>education at the University of Otago and<br>to ensuring that its traditions and<br>values endure following his 40 years<br>professor Cotter undertook his PhD at<br>the University of Wollongong having<br>stayed cold stress physiology for his<br>masters it was inevitable that his PhD<br>would be on heat stress and on this<br>theme of endurance that set of<br>qualifications kept Professor Cotter in<br>the books for I estimate around 10 years<br>and tonight we see the reward of that<br>combination of deep-seated interests<br>talent and endurance in the promotion<br>that we are celebrating with more than<br>110 scholarly publications to his name<br>professor kata is an accomplished<br>scientist renowned for his expertise and<br>sports physiology<br>but that is not enough to get you<br>promoted at the University of Otago to<br>get promoted to professor at otaku is a<br>challenge and you have to be an<br>all-rounder and what I'd like to draw<br>attention to is or really emphasize what<br>the vice-chancellor has already<br>identified which is Jim's dedication to<br>his students for his undergraduate<br>teaching he was nominated for best<br>lecturer in 2016 that year he was also<br>one of just five teaching staff at the<br>University who achieved a high number of<br>commendations and the quality<br>advancement units student and graduate<br>opinion survey he is a sought-after<br>supervisor and has supervised around 17<br>PhD students and 19 MSC students and for<br>the high quality of this supervision he<br>was nominated for supervisor of the year<br>in 2003 and 2004 and 2010 and as the<br>vice-chancellor just indicated he took<br>out that award in 2010 at a personal<br>level Jim is one of the nicest people<br>you could ever meet and from the<br>standpoint of a pro vice-chancellor he<br>is part of the social glue that holds<br>the fabric of this school together his<br>quiet leadership is enormous ly<br>important and deeply appreciated and I<br>would like to publicly thank him for<br>that tonight Jim is going to discuss the<br>interactions between exercise and<br>environment looking at ultra-endurance<br>in a context of severe stress from heat<br>cold hypoxia and dehydration please join<br>me in welcoming professor Jim cotton<br>tena koe a Tafari tena koe tu<br>no na kar t nae amici tena koutou tena<br>tutor Kyoto to Tory vice-chancellor<br>pro-vice Chancellor emeritus professor<br>booth thank you very much for very<br>generous introductions at this stage a<br>bit of start a timer because I never<br>finished my lectures and this one I'm<br>going to try and do<br>thank you very much than my family for<br>coming<br>specially from sofa and mom and Terry<br>for coming from Wollongong it's amazing<br>and everybody else friends and<br>colleagues has turned up thank you very<br>much and for your support of course over<br>the time so we're going to fly through<br>various topics not going to get into<br>some of the things that interest me<br>physiologically because it probably<br>won't interest you so we'll just we'll<br>just go through some things and it's<br>it's it's amusing allowed as much as<br>anything so this is this is where I'm<br>from and I are deeply appreciative of my<br>mum and dad and family and my family and<br>I know I'm ever vissa because they are<br>invariably asked me a question and by<br>the time I get around to answering it<br>they completely forgot what they asked<br>me<br>and I think that's the hallmark and of<br>course the friends which from from<br>everywhere that's me that's where I come<br>from and that's that me so her farm yeah<br>um I've got a mouse somewhere her farm<br>was down in here and this mountain was<br>in front and the founder was behind and<br>of course we've got quite a lot of rain<br>like five meters so I don't actually<br>find that a very extremely worried man<br>out there at all I was possibly destined<br>to be a scientist from a young age<br>because I remember my primary school<br>teacher turning around and yelling at me<br>to shut up<br>but it might have had something more to<br>do with the fact we were sitting opossum<br>in line up this mountain here and then<br>no on physique camp and the lecture is<br>turning the tables and just asking us<br>why all the time and if you get that<br>extended period where you've got people<br>asking you why and questioning your<br>values really is one of those fulcrum<br>points in your life where you wonder<br>where you're going and why in being<br>promoted and being acknowledged I also<br>have to acknowledge to have become a<br>much leaner school we've lost a lot of<br>good college from the University and<br>that that's inevitable I mean we had to<br>downsize but I very much appreciate<br>those people and I acknowledge them and<br>I still wholeheartedly believe that what<br>we represent is physical education and<br>it has a very strong future and that's<br>but partly what tonight's lecture is<br>about it's about why ok I'm a<br>physiologist I'm exercise physiologist<br>but we operate in a wider context and I<br>just want to provide those contexts this<br>is me as well I mean the West Coasters -<br>but this is also me and I'm just amazing<br>colleagues fellow Ainsley in particular<br>has taught me so much cerebrovascular<br>and he was Kate's primary supervisor in<br>Luke's and then I was Sam's primary<br>supervisor and he was<br>viki's and so we've Co supervised so<br>much and then he was McKee's as well<br>when I was Sean doesn't but we we<br>interact in their supervision and I just<br>learnt an enormous amount from Phil and<br>then co supervisor on down and then<br>supervisions and mentors of further PhD<br>students and now their colleagues and<br>and I think the mark have and something<br>that I truly truly value is the fact<br>that all of these people are smarter<br>than me and and they're going a lot<br>further than I will and I think that's<br>fantastic<br>and I also acknowledge God's leave it<br>God came and did his research live with<br>me in Melbourne and when he left Toto go<br>I came and took his job that he's no<br>longer with us unfortunately he's it so<br>he's a true legend and I acknowledge our<br>facilities they're amazing physique<br>schools just got such neat and in<br>paralleled it facilities for research<br>and teaching and staff I mean Nigel as<br>the hero they're just just a phenomenal<br>character and the mentors the scientific<br>mentors in my life that these two in<br>particular and the other people I work<br>with<br>so yeah just we we integrative Lee study<br>we study integrated systems that's what<br>the body is you know we teach it as<br>separate items but it simply doesn't<br>operate that way<br>therefore our questions are necessarily<br>integrative and of course so other<br>people all of these people have more<br>that's I guess you know what we're here<br>to talk about exercise and the<br>environment and this is Joe Donnelly him<br>any of you or no and he's clearly to get<br>himself to that kind of nice spot and<br>you might recognize this mountain here<br>five and a half thousand meters he's had<br>to do some exercise to get there and<br>it's not the easiest environment to do<br>that in so that's what you see but what<br>actually characterizes that environ<br>well when you exercise and you exercise<br>against gravity your undertaking force<br>so this for me now starting to get it<br>what actually is an environment and<br>what's exercise but it's a lot more than<br>that<br>it's has some level of oxygen it has<br>some level of so it can have excess or<br>insufficient it has a lot of thermal<br>energy well not much thermal energy has<br>a lot of water or not much whoops it has<br>a lot of vitamins minerals or not much<br>and it has a lot of oxidized stress so<br>high energy short-lived molecules that<br>can do a lot of damage or not much we<br>can block those with multivitamins so<br>they we could add noise we could add<br>light we could have pollution pathogens<br>social stress and they're all equally<br>important and if you're a psychologist<br>then you might want to substitute social<br>into one of those but nevertheless in<br>every stress that we have too much and<br>none and in fact the only place you can<br>go I think and you have to go way deep<br>into the universe to get away from all<br>of those we could just go to the Dark<br>Side of the Moon and you'd be pretty<br>close but but that's important because<br>we actually respond to all of those<br>stresses we need them all so all of them<br>and this is another fundamental point<br>all of them<br>outside your body but all of them are<br>inside your body as well and<br>particularly in yourselves and only<br>exercise generates all of them<br>internally not social stress internal<br>either moreover it's powerful it's<br>selective and selective in time it's<br>regulated it's mostly within but also<br>outside selves so we activates multiple<br>pathways multiple senses and cells<br>particularly in muscle during exercise<br>and without feeding and a stiff<br>with heating without and so forth so<br>we've got a huge number of pathways<br>being activated by these stresses<br>selectively and that's what exercises<br>for me exercise is just this all mighty<br>complicated stressor and if we want to<br>really understand exercise we have the<br>dilemma a that down and figure out what<br>each of those stresses does and to what<br>extent does it drive fatigue the what<br>there's what extent that actually<br>obligatory and driving adaptation and<br>that's going to depend of course on the<br>nature of the exercise and the nature of<br>the individual and their fatigue state<br>and the medications in their age and all<br>sorts of things and we consider all of<br>those things in our research and we try<br>and control for some of them we<br>manipulate them or we figure out how<br>these things are being manipulated so<br>for example you can have enormous<br>metabolic stress and oxidative stress an<br>untrained person walking up the stairs<br>whereas a trained person to get their<br>cells into the same state and drive the<br>same fatigue and drive adaptation they<br>might have to sprint up and down the<br>stairs a few times but as far as the<br>cells are concerned it's the same stress<br>and that's important for determining<br>safety tolerance adaptation and and not<br>only that it's not only happening inside<br>your cells but more and more it's being<br>realized the hundreds of molecules that<br>are released out of cells during<br>exercise and they communicate with<br>neighboring cells other organs so the<br>muscle talks to the liver to fat tissue<br>to the brain we're releasing hundreds of<br>molecules that go and communicate<br>elsewhere so exercise is kind of<br>complicated but it's also incredibly<br>versatile and incredibly simple just do<br>it but when you just do it there's a lot<br>going on so what this now no there's a<br>whole lot of background but what that<br>allows us to then understand is that<br>exercise is inherently and difficult<br>it's difficult in environments that<br>impose the same stresses so if you're<br>exercising the heat<br>the better the athlete the more the heat<br>you generate because the more metabolism<br>that goes on the faster you go so that's<br>why athletes find hot environments hard<br>but that fit so that used to dealing<br>with heat from the inside so they can<br>also tolerate warm environments well but<br>you also set a world record in the<br>marathon if you go to the opposite<br>environment to exercise them because it<br>doesn't cost you so much physiology to<br>be in that environment to sustain that<br>level of exercise to you so water and<br>you save the cardiovascular strain and<br>that allows you to exercise harder<br>because they have a lot of downstream<br>effects that cause the early fatigue but<br>unfortunately that environment has lack<br>of oxygen and it has a lack of energy<br>substrates and so forth and that can<br>compromise your exercise so this is<br>where exercise an environment of<br>physiology very much cross over so when<br>we deal with the Olympics and<br>firefighting and you know whether it's<br>wildland firefighters or domestic<br>firefighting these are all kind of<br>issues that we deal with that we're<br>thinking about and whether we<br>superimpose so whether we train we add<br>the heat of the environment to the heat<br>of our training to try and enhance their<br>training adaptation or we stand on a<br>vibration board and try and add to the<br>stress of that way through the<br>vibrational physical stress so there's<br>become really interesting areas to<br>actually working now last that is kind<br>of intense stuff hopefully so I'm trying<br>to front-load some of the worst of it to<br>stay alive and to thrive you need to<br>keep a bunch of things pretty constant<br>so that's this sylheti or the alkalinity<br>the temperature the glucose levels the<br>blood pressure the what the cell volumes<br>there's lots of things that get detected<br>and get kept pretty constant<br>for many of these things if they get out<br>of whack and exercise forces them all<br>out of whack you activate some sensor<br>some some thing that will try and<br>correct it so it's not a sensor the<br>sensor detects it generally in your ear<br>and your brain will coordinate a lot of<br>this stuff and it will activate<br>something like this<br>wedding all those adulation of your skin<br>blood vessels and they will ramp up<br>their activity according to how bad this<br>situations getting and they'll reach a<br>peak and that peak usually because it's<br>not how high the system could go it's<br>being competed against by some other<br>system and at some point the system gets<br>so bad that it fails so we measure all<br>of these things to try and characterize<br>the person's tolerance and therefore<br>their fitness their safety prospects and<br>so forth so for heat if this was your<br>body temperature going up where you<br>release your vasoconstriction you have<br>another system that actively dilates<br>blood vessels you start sweating but by<br>far in a way you change your behavior so<br>if you're exercising just reduce your<br>intensity because you reduce your heat<br>production so the heat stress isn't so<br>that but these occur acutely and<br>chronically we could go to the other<br>side sorry<br>so when we go cold we actually have some<br>decent response systems as well but it's<br>our behavior by far and away we're not<br>actually very good in the cold<br>physiologically we rely entirely on a<br>behavior therefore we hate the cold and<br>that's why we hate the cold because we<br>rely on mr. get us out of it or keep us<br>safe so by and large people who are fit<br>have better of all of these things they<br>start with a lower body temperature they<br>crank up the heat losses faster they go<br>to more powerful levels they sustain it<br>for longer they go to higher<br>temperatures before they fail you could<br>do that for the glucose control their ph<br>control whatever so being fit truly is<br>physiologically quite a complicated set<br>of attributes that gives you a<br>generalized stress tolerance so you<br>could go into a hot environment you<br>detect that environment and do something<br>about it earlier you can do it more<br>powerfully you can sustain that<br>environment for long but you can<br>tolerate higher temperatures for example<br>in a sauna before it fails<br>before you fail so being fit has quite a<br>cool set of attributes that give you<br>versatile stress tolerance and we'll<br>talk about some of those situations a<br>bit later but that's our physiology but<br>part of being fit also is having better<br>behavior and ultimately with you a visit<br>group in a glacial stream where you're<br>an athlete running an Hawaiian then it's<br>your behavior that by far and away is<br>the most important thing physiologically<br>we're actually relatively limited our<br>behavior keeps us out of trouble but<br>being an athlete you have this<br>competition between your behavior and<br>your physiology pushing your physiology<br>to the limit<br>the person who has the best physiology<br>pushes it the most wins so I'll give you<br>an example of how we tend to study this<br>so Gord came over and this is one of the<br>studies we did in Melbourne where we put<br>people in a fig fridge for 45 minutes at<br>4 degrees naked semi naked and we either<br>put hot packs or cold packs on their<br>thighs and then got them to do some<br>exercise and it didn't actually make any<br>difference whether they had cold packs<br>or hot packs that being in the fridge<br>compared with not being in the fridge<br>for 45 minutes when they got on the<br>'black and did standardized exercise<br>there was a massive benefit to their<br>cardiovascular system because it didn't<br>have to serve the skin to offload the<br>heat and then what we typically do so<br>this is a typical experiment we do we<br>set people off at a standard fixed<br>workload that we control so we can<br>figure out what we've done to their<br>physiology and what is driving it then<br>we let them self pace and as soon as we<br>let them go for it they go 20 percent<br>faster if they've been in the fridge<br>than if they haven't and what we see<br>here is it just closes up the<br>cardiovascular difference so it's the<br>cardiovascular benefit of being cold<br>that gives them the better work<br>tolerance so we're often marrying<br>together the physiology and the behavior<br>and I don't think exercise does as well<br>enough where it looks at both sides of<br>it you know commercial enterprises and<br>things tend to look at just the behavior<br>like altitude training and it's<br>believes it works but doesn't notice a<br>man who did they just feel like they can<br>behave better whereas a physiologist<br>would say well why does that work better<br>but we need to marry these two things<br>together so why focus on exercise why<br>extreme environments and I for me and<br>for most academics research teaching and<br>services rolls all together where does<br>one start and where does the other one<br>finish and in fact where do the context<br>finish so this is we could be talking<br>about health which is our lived<br>experience we could be talking about<br>sport and performance or survival and<br>for me exercise isn't about whether<br>you're working or playing or doing five<br>sets of ten reps or whatever you know<br>these guys are walking this is us<br>Westerners walking across a bridge while<br>this guy who's working is waiting for us<br>at the other end fairly typical of<br>Westerners but for me they're both<br>exercise I'm not going to quibble about<br>what exercise what's physical activity<br>you're just doing something that takes<br>us us as far as I'm concerned for this<br>and of course the context of disease and<br>lifestyle as well and and also you know<br>our lifestyle goes against a lot of it<br>about whether you're working or be kills<br>us and of course there's knowledge we<br>can study exercise extreme environments<br>just to understand how we work and the<br>value of that shouldn't be<br>underestimated<br>and we get an awareness writings<br>particularly this this little piece I<br>was just typing up the slide one of my<br>students contact Damini he sent me a<br>link to this and he said one of his<br>athletes asked him about it and he's a<br>coach and does he think they should buy<br>it and I'll try and read it if I can<br>because he won't be able to experience<br>though this is an amber wave bracelet<br>experience thermal comfort on-demand<br>developed by MIT scientists ember wave<br>lets you cool down when you're too hot<br>and warm up when you're too cold<br>amber wave is powered by patent-pending<br>technology that uses cutting-edge the<br>thermoelectrics and precisely engineered<br>algorithm is to produce maximally<br>effective temperature something or other<br>waves sorry you can't typical trough so<br>you can read the rest of it<br>and it cost quite a bit so for me I mean<br>that typifies westernization really<br>doesn't it they're impressive words it's<br>an association with stem quite<br>deliberately the science technology<br>engineering a mess at one level you're<br>achieving thermal comfort that seems<br>worthy for the person and the planet<br>because you can personalize your comfort<br>so you don't need to change the<br>thermostat you just changed that thing<br>but provided of course you can't achieve<br>that same goal by adjusting your<br>clothing for example a little bit<br>cheaper and say the myriad resources<br>involved in the development and<br>production and distribution of of that<br>device and as importantly and as<br>insidiously it removes you basic stress<br>exposure which is he thinks the bigger<br>issue there and your behavioral<br>responsibilities so as we do these<br>things and as we disempower people's<br>experience lives we've got to wonder<br>what we're why we're doing it and I can<br>talk 45 minutes on any of those<br>particular things that we're not going<br>so the reason I raised that one is<br>because this is actually what my PhD was<br>on it was on raising you evaluating the<br>skins role in thermal inputs and it just<br>didn't make any sense to me that device<br>because well I figured out in the PhD<br>and what was it I think a pretty cool<br>contribution was if you heat or call<br>your limb extremities it actually<br>doesn't make any difference to how you<br>feel but if you hate will call your face<br>it has a big effect so if you're gonna<br>make one of those devices pin it on your<br>forehead<br>and you'll be able to tell from this<br>wreck that I made for my PhD I don't<br>tend to endear comfort I guess in<br>experience and luck I mean their friends<br>at the time and it seemed most people<br>most of them are still friends which is<br>pretty cool cold sensitivity so what we<br>actually found some useful stuff I think<br>we respond to the temperature and rate<br>of call and we kinda already knew that<br>we confirmed it but what if you warm you<br>don't respond to the rate you only<br>respond to the temperature is if unless<br>it's particularly quick and when the<br>skin has more role as an input for<br>determining our thermal behavior which<br>again is really important more than our<br>sweating which is more than a skin blood<br>flow so they do tend to turn to Tim over<br>your brain temperature and most<br>importantly we have this strong regional<br>differences so your hands and feet can<br>detect the fact that something is cold<br>but it doesn't change how you feel<br>but if you do the same on your head it<br>can detect the cold as well but it also<br>changes how you feel so that's what I<br>mean make the device and put it on your<br>head but actually there's some kind of<br>bizarre situations here and I just I'm<br>getting a bit slow and I'm gonna have to<br>start reading some notes so I don't get<br>no people as I say guaranteed I wouldn't<br>get finished and I do want to prove them<br>wrong<br>there's some really interesting<br>situations you know I've got to tell you<br>the context we look it looks like we<br>developed to be like this because we are<br>we're phenomenally good at getting rid<br>of heat so we stand up and we're here<br>less and we're completely covered in<br>sweat glands we have double sets of<br>those that they ladders all over are<br>well distributed around our skin we only<br>don't sweat thermally on our hands so we<br>can grip stuff but it's course when you<br>grip stuff a long time that you get<br>sweaty palms or some people get nervous<br>sweaty palms but by and large we're just<br>heat loss machines that we need to be<br>because if we chase something we produce<br>twice as much heat as that thing but we<br>can still out them regulated which is I<br>think remarkable<br>and that's our physiology our physiology<br>for heat loss makes us truly unique in<br>so many ways the power and the<br>complexity of it but it's our behavior<br>that's just so much more again because<br>we can just shoot it so we don't even<br>then need to run so far and we you know<br>we have these other options we could<br>drive after it these days so we really<br>are remarkable but as I say week across<br>us twice as much heat to move as a<br>quadruped it that we're trying to chase<br>and kill and when we walk it costs an<br>enormous amount of energy because it's<br>so inefficient to walk that fast and<br>what they think happened with Craig<br>Barrett is he put ice in his cab he's<br>got his cap off there but he's already<br>overheated and what we're wondering what<br>Gordon I were wondering is did he fool<br>himself so an athlete so sports science<br>has to take responsibility for its<br>interventions and if you've got someone<br>who's redlining it physiologically be<br>careful what you do with them or as a<br>another aspect of my PhD he was showing<br>the distribution of sweating and<br>unfortunately you don't sweat much off<br>your legs you only sweat like half as<br>much as off the other body but you<br>produce most of the heat out of your<br>legs and you don't sweat that much I was<br>there on the palms of your hands so what<br>this guy did he's really heavy shouldn't<br>have been able to win the Hawaii on them<br>but he did and what he or she did with<br>Lars neba a very good thermal<br>physiologist he put gloves on his hands<br>and because in the Hawaii Ironman you're<br>allowed to use the ice baths<br>he just kept filling his gloves up with<br>ice and because that doesn't change the<br>timbre of the perception of body<br>temperature and you've got a massive<br>blood flow through your hands they gave<br>them a really good heat loss mechanism<br>without affecting as thin regulation so<br>you can manipulate these things however<br>you want but be careful sort of what you<br>do here's a really bizarre situation as<br>well and it was really sad<br>this guy was winning the World Open<br>water swimming competition and he died<br>in the last race of heat stroke and they<br>thought the water was too hot and until<br>that time they didn't know how hot it's<br>too hot to swim so Cal's PhD we actually<br>got people to do 200 swims in the flume<br>and a lot of them were in water at 2:33<br>the air temperature was 35 and we put<br>solar lamps right above them but we had<br>to protect them so they didn't smash<br>from the water and hitting people and we<br>tried to figure out how hot is too hot<br>to swim and even in 33 degrees they<br>didn't get into trouble and here's the<br>key if you're swimming in 33 degrees and<br>your core temperature goes up you know<br>that's gone up and you if you're<br>swimming in 33 degrees you get<br>uncomfortable when your core temperature<br>goes up and that's great because then<br>you're not going to overheat because<br>you're going to behaviorally and<br>regulate so that's we looked at all the<br>therm regulation and stress hormones and<br>the inflammatory mediators in the blood<br>and all sorts of stuff but ultimately<br>you want to know that this you want to<br>know whether athlete knows of the<br>situation they're in and the reason we<br>were curious about that is that's 33<br>degrees that's a skin temperature that<br>this building is designed for that keeps<br>your skin at 33 degrees which is optimal<br>comfort so we didn't know where the<br>swimmers would be in danger because<br>they're at a thermally comfortable skin<br>temperature and we actually used that as<br>a research model to figure out that the<br>brain is about four times more thermo<br>sensitive than the skin and driving the<br>discomfort and that's really important<br>it's something I forgot to mention of<br>course the better the athlete the more<br>they'll rely on evaporation so if you're<br>running through the air you absolutely<br>need evaporation and this is why Tokyo<br>is going to be such an interesting<br>situation because it's so humid<br>the faster athletes need of operation<br>more the spectator doesn't need so much<br>you can't evaporate in the flat and<br>water so that's the other reason we're<br>curious about that so anyway these are<br>the contexts we<br>so we're gonna have to move on a bit and<br>summary one of three humans detect and<br>respond to a wide range of stresses you<br>can probably read that faster than I can<br>so it's from within and without acute<br>and chronic the exercise in the<br>environment share many stresses that<br>makes some environments hard and some<br>easy to exercise and exercise is<br>uniquely complex and it stresses but<br>it's all the lousy self regulating that<br>relies on behavior that's often most<br>important acutely in chronically our<br>heat defense is a uniquely powerful<br>elaborate and complex and science<br>technology and engineering is amazing<br>but it also has major social and<br>environmental responsibilities so move<br>on the second part I ran this past my<br>daughter the other day and she got to<br>the end and she said anything like<br>positive in there and I think I was in<br>response to this slide and what the<br>slide is a really cool finding from the<br>Dunedin study well it's cool but it's a<br>bit distressing as well these were the<br>mums and these were the dads of their<br>sons and daughters and if you look at<br>their fitness as a late teenager it's<br>not looking good for the next generation<br>and this is kind of the line for<br>independent living and these are young<br>people and their physiological pryin<br>and every year you age that's what<br>happens to this measure of fitness and<br>this is an important problematic<br>indicator of your longevity because if<br>you test somebody's aerobic fitness<br>you're testing all of their<br>physiological systems at once it's a<br>snapshot and how good is their body how<br>resilient is how powerful is that how<br>much can they do we know and we've been<br>doing these experiments and other people<br>have as well where you can make people<br>do sprint exercise and endurance<br>exercise and it doesn't actually make<br>any difference you get good fitness<br>regardless of what type of exercise you<br>do provided you're responder some people<br>get about 20% I mean we get none you can<br>view the best exercise program that<br>could be designed and you get no change<br>in fitness doesn't mean that's<br>valuable you could be getting other<br>benefits like glucose control bone<br>density anti depression you know lots of<br>other effects but don't expect that's<br>necessarily going to get fitter and the<br>reason this is important is because<br>unfit people have about 70% more chance<br>of dying early well that they're a lot<br>more likely to die early then people are<br>moderately fit and people who are highly<br>fit or less likely to die early whether<br>you're male or whether you're female and<br>we don't want to get too much into the<br>detail of that but basically the more<br>you do the better and the first bits the<br>most important for longevity just get<br>out and do something but in terms of<br>maximizing cardiac function muscle<br>function brain function and things and<br>some disease avoidance is it looks like<br>more is better but for overall longevity<br>it's not the case it's very much<br>diminishing returns just go and do<br>something now quickly why does exercise<br>for example help the brain structure and<br>function and the reason for this slide<br>is we were looking at whether high<br>intensity exercise my optimized brain<br>function all I want to say about this is<br>for the brain or many other organs<br>there's multiple ways exercise does it<br>it directly is activated through the<br>brain and does things directly in the<br>brain brain is controlled by blood flow<br>blood flow you change the blood flow to<br>the brain when you exercise depending<br>how fit you are fitness changes your<br>glucose and blood pressure control both<br>of those things determine the long-term<br>health for the brain as I said before<br>exercise releases lots of chemicals out<br>of muscle that can come around and<br>affect brain structure and function so<br>when we think of which type of exercise<br>is better or worse for the brain well<br>higher systolic blood pressure might not<br>be that valuable during exercise but<br>maybe you release more my accounts from<br>muscle or maybe that has a better effect<br>we just were not in a position to know<br>which type of exercise might optimize<br>certain outcomes and why there's just so<br>many levels at which exercise is having<br>its effect<br>here's something encouraging for us who<br>are aging this is our brain blood flow<br>as we get older it doesn't look great<br>recipe halves as you go through your<br>life spin but it's higher if you're<br>fitter and more importantly what<br>Karissa's PhD showed is for young and<br>old people you improve the brain blood<br>flow control and that's the most<br>important thing the brain's ability to<br>regulate its own blood supply so it was<br>the first that was the first study to<br>longitudinally show in humans that<br>exercise training improves the brains<br>control of its own blood supply travis<br>at the moments going on and looking at<br>combinations of stresses on the brain<br>function cognitively and and invested<br>lee lena shoemakers going at the moment<br>and we're looking at what is it in<br>exercise that's that's maybe underlying<br>the cognitive improvements that we know<br>we get in exercise and of course Liana<br>was in the paper earlier this week with<br>a study looking at the role of exercise<br>and improving cognitive function<br>we talked before about the fact that<br>exercise glucose control is one of those<br>factors it's important for the brain and<br>for many other organs as well and we can<br>be smart with exercise if we time it<br>just before a meals for example what<br>Monique came up with was this notion of<br>exercise snacking and if you just do 6 1<br>minute bouts before each meal that<br>blunts your glucose levels you want to<br>keep your glucose levels down and you<br>want to keep them constant so you want<br>to keep them down here if you can but<br>these are in pre-diabetics and if we've<br>just gotten to do a little bit of<br>exercise before every meal compared with<br>a 30 minute exercise before them dinner<br>you kick your blood glucose down keep it<br>more stable that lasted also across the<br>next day and it drop your blood pressure<br>so there are you know there's<br>physiologically smart ways to think<br>about how we might want to dose and time<br>or exercise I'm going to have to skip<br>through a little bit<br>so we've got 18 minutes I think on the<br>land<br>so basically exercises I think it's<br>wonderful that it's pluripotent and<br>gives most non communicable diseases and<br>most people there's a dive and non<br>communicable disease it impacts most of<br>their system that's a nonlinear benefit<br>dose so you just have to do something<br>it's highly versatile it has low risk<br>and it's free exercise is more than<br>medicine because it's good for our<br>society in communities it improves that<br>connectedness reduces crime co2<br>emissions resource usage traffic<br>congestion depending how we do it this<br>is increasingly how we're doing it we're<br>boxing in space and time and the concept<br>of what it is and I think that's going<br>to become problematic it's useful don't<br>get me wrong but we have to look at the<br>consequences of that compared with how<br>we used to exercise and how many<br>populations do exercise these are we<br>were walking up to Everest base camp and<br>these kids were throwing snowballs at us<br>and they just walk to school which is<br>another village somewhere else now<br>here's here's another key point our<br>environment increasingly our lifestyle<br>removes all stresses and that's a<br>problem because we respond and adapt and<br>detect all of those stresses we don't<br>detect their absence it's insidious its<br>chronic and it removes their structure<br>and function and that becomes a<br>self-fulfilling prophecy because we lose<br>their capacity then to respond and we<br>need to be in a benign environment so<br>that's what that slide says so I'm not<br>going to stop there and as importantly<br>that then means we would regard this is<br>dangerous and this is not and therefore<br>we have risk management well they're my<br>kids so it doesn't matter but if there<br>was our school kids you would have a<br>risk management strategy for that in<br>fact you wouldn't do it where your job<br>so I think maybe we need to recalibrate<br>what we consider to be the locus of the<br>risk is easy to blame somebody for that<br>it's hard to blame somebody for the<br>consequences of that so maybe we just<br>need to wit to rethink that exercise has<br>caused more than medicine for<br>individuals and for our interns that we<br>learn and experience of their self and<br>others<br>we appreciate the environment we learn<br>from the environment because unlike any<br>structured environment the environment<br>is completely random it's infinite it's<br>such a rich learning opportunity and<br>therefore we develop empathy for the<br>environment and here's just another<br>little point to put in here is that we<br>are complicit ly potentiating our<br>environmental stresses throughout the<br>greenhouse gas emissions while as I<br>showed you before becoming less able to<br>tolerate them collectively and<br>individually and at some point we're<br>going to get a collision the consequence<br>of this and we can foresee this so<br>there's a bit of a worry and physio that<br>people are focusing too much on Fitness<br>first of all you have to learn how to<br>move and then you're going to want to<br>move these two scenes here within about<br>five kilometres of here that one's not<br>much further and that could be your<br>backyard then if you have that<br>capability and that desire then you're<br>going to want to go somewhere a bit<br>further afield and that's all pretty<br>local well you need a car but it's<br>reasonably local and you love that<br>environment if you build up the<br>experience to be in that environment and<br>these were just some snapshots taken<br>over the last week I was instructing on<br>a phys ed camp and the hills and it was<br>I'm completely shifted actually from but<br>I I mean the feedback you get from this<br>situation they're truly transformative<br>experiences for people and when we think<br>of what we're doing to the environment<br>and need to develop empathy and to be<br>comfortable in that environment<br>why wouldn't we so we have to<br>financially find a way I think to allow<br>these experiences in our education this<br>is a good<br>is a conference we held and we took<br>people over man Alfred on a day trip and<br>then we took a bunch of them away for<br>the weekend and you which we can be<br>doing that in New Zealand we have such a<br>unique environment and there's such<br>powerful experiences for people and the<br>great academic experiences as well so we<br>showed them we can prioritize an active<br>lifestyle we can't afford not to we can<br>meet half of the WH O's sustainable<br>policy framework development things we<br>have legislature opportunity for Maori<br>perspectives and that's that's key we<br>have Anna standing natural environment<br>of benign climate and fauna who else<br>climate may be we have a populations<br>relatively small educated egalitarian<br>and protected against big pharma I mean<br>if New Zealand can't do it who can crops<br>so summary to exercise and fitness are<br>important but not at the expense of the<br>environment their own immensely complex<br>and they must understood and<br>sufficiently understood but highly<br>versatile and accessible exercises<br>powerful medicine but it's more than<br>just medicine we structurally suppress<br>it by modernity and that's I think<br>through stem and consumerism but that<br>also allows us to get out of it and it<br>provides rich opportunities for<br>development now I'm allowed I think<br>eleven minute and ten minutes sorry<br>how about thirty nine here's just some<br>things I just want to touch on cross<br>adaptation and then a couple of<br>different environments so we've talked<br>about this but we can cross a debt<br>between different stresses so if you<br>can't go to high altitude maybe you can<br>use heat as a stressor because actually<br>use a lot of the same sort of particular<br>pathways that protect cells<br>so maybe we can chronically exposed to<br>this and protect against that if we're<br>going in for surgery and we know this<br>the surgery itself the anesthesia and<br>then the bed rest after it to be<br>deconditioning<br>stressful ones deconditioning so we can<br>use stresses and if people heavily<br>osteoarthritic or whatever an account<br>exercise use another stressor that was<br>within exercise so there's all of these<br>opportunities to cross adapt and cross<br>tolerate and and this is an amazing<br>future it's highly exciting area so<br>aerobic fitness protects you against<br>many things and here's an example we<br>dehydrated untrained people and trained<br>people when we got them to exercise and<br>this is how fast their heart rate<br>drifted up in exercise if they were<br>untrained and they were well hydrated<br>they had less drift than if they were<br>dehydrated but if you're trained you<br>don't get the heart rate drifts so much<br>and it doesn't make any difference if<br>you're hyper hydrated so Fitness<br>provides cross tolerance protection<br>against some of these individual<br>stresses I'm heating with or instead of<br>exercise for who should we actually do<br>that because of course exercise has a<br>lot of heat so just do the exercise but<br>maybe we can supplemented for athletes<br>to improve their fitness maybe other<br>people might want to do it you know hot<br>yoga changed decrease the dose of<br>exercise and increase the heat so you're<br>substituting one for another and it's<br>simply another way to achieve a similar<br>outcome unless your regards sauna<br>bathing by the fins if they saw about<br>four to seven times a week compared with<br>only once a week they're basically<br>having their mortality risk in any given<br>follow-up period they're pretty major<br>effects of heat admittedly they don't<br>know whether that's necessarily the<br>sauna or the plunge pooling or the cold<br>associated with it not competitively the<br>skirt she died and that was the world<br>saw on a bathing champ so if you do<br>something in your you ignore your<br>we don't think heats particularly useful<br>in training to enhance fitness so<br>Anthony trained one leg hot and one leg<br>cold for endurance for strength training<br>he didn't get more muscle mass so you<br>see the big distribution of people's in<br>purchase II when they trained he didn't<br>get a dip<br>friends between the two so we didn't get<br>a benefit for the muscle development the<br>strength developments weren't different<br>between whether the dealer trained leg<br>hot or not in terms of the strength<br>capacities so we don't advocate using<br>heat to try and enhance performance we<br>don't advocate altitude either I just<br>want to make a quick comment about we<br>can add stresses together so if you<br>don't upright exercise even for people<br>who are trained the next day you have<br>more blood volume if you now do that<br>exercise in the heat the next day you<br>have even more blood volume and if you<br>do exercise in the heat and you<br>dehydrate the next day you have even<br>more blood volume so if you randomize<br>the order that people do this and what<br>allowed that was the fact that you have<br>more of a hormones that conserves fluid<br>so the hotter people got the more they<br>had this hormone and the more that<br>increased their blood volume so we can<br>selectively add these stresses on to<br>each other it doesn't mean you should<br>train hot in the heat every day it just<br>means it's a possibility and these<br>stresses combined with each other and in<br>fact and some of you may not be aware of<br>this I mean athletes have about up to<br>50% more blood in their bodies per<br>kilogram than non-athletes and more<br>blood is good and you can have a lot<br>more blood and a lot lower blood<br>pressure at the same time because if<br>this was a more compliant they hold more<br>blood so that's what happened they had<br>more blood and they had lower blood<br>pressure<br>both great outcomes as I say doesn't<br>mean we should be hydrated every day but<br>it doesn't mean we shouldn't we actually<br>train people in the heat and we tested<br>this question for the first time because<br>they thought humans can't adapt to<br>dehydration and we can't if we go in the<br>heat every day on the fiftieth day we<br>need just as much water as we did on the<br>first day and therefore heat hits off<br>and I mean sorry hypo hydration<br>dehydration is often frowned upon but we<br>asked the question well what if you you<br>can you add that through dehydration not<br>to dehydration but through it can you<br>use it as a supplemental stressor so we<br>adapted people in the heat with them<br>without being dehydrated and of course<br>they improved in a whole lot of things<br>that this is whether they improve more<br>with the dehydration then with the you<br>hydration every day and and at the very<br>least what we can say is dehydration<br>didn't impair adaptation if anything for<br>several things that possibly enhanced it<br>but again we're not prepared to say that<br>people should dehydrate every day that<br>certainly we have no evidence that it<br>appears the hydration and this is<br>another big area that should be<br>researched so I think this is a<br>phenomenally exciting area so stress<br>conditioning has enormous potential we<br>can use environmental or artificial<br>stresses with or without exercise<br>particularly those who can't exercise or<br>find it uncomfortable to have physical<br>barriers or whatever we can use it to<br>provide cross tolerance to a novel<br>stressor so we can precondition before<br>removing the stress such as<br>immobilization or before a novel<br>stressor to surgery heat waves or<br>deployment to a stressful environment<br>it's relevant mostly for those who can't<br>exercise and we can use it to improve<br>our knowledge of the mechanisms and<br>performance health and disease but it's<br>early days and we wouldn't advocate that<br>athletes do it that's what should just<br>train and combining stressors I'd showed<br>you an example where it worked but<br>there's no hardly anyone has looked at<br>it in a training capacity but no-one's<br>yet showing that a few years like heat<br>and hypoxia altitude and add them<br>together that a person gets fitter they<br>don't the heat wins the altitude doesn't<br>so it's appealing to add stresses<br>together for conditioning but no one's<br>it's shown it to be useful right the<br>final thing I'm just going to quickly<br>boundaries of human weight we've been<br>doing adventure racing for a while what<br>are the minds they have come for the<br>world's toughest endurance competition<br>and we wondered how damaging the sort of<br>thing was covering over 300 miles<br>testing themselves against the sheer<br>Mountain tea's gaping ice core vices and<br>freezing rivers one of the profs that I<br>was working with in Wollongong he<br>thought we were irresponsible to do this<br>and yet he doesn't nothing for a week<br>and we exercise continuously for a week<br>and I don't I still don't know which of<br>those is more damaging in terrible<br>storms we don't find any we've done this<br>with the adventure race around here and<br>we don't find anything that<br>significantly impaired during these<br>week-long exercise bouts so this is why<br>we've got in to study it and we test the<br>cognition and blood glucose and strength<br>and power and endurance and various<br>things and nothing was really bad<br>affected what goes on when you do really<br>long exercises you see essentially<br>fatigued and that just stops everything<br>from getting over exerted the heart gets<br>a little bit affected for a short time<br>but but and the other thing is we don't<br>know whether we lose memory capacity and<br>older age but the reality is I remember<br>every day of every single adventurous<br>for the last 28 years I don't remember<br>much else<br>so what I don't even care if it's real<br>at least you have a memory of something<br>and just another point that we think we<br>we think we have good endurance we're<br>going to the 500 kilometer races this<br>guys fly halfway around the world and<br>they don't even have a compass and they<br>don't just sleep just stop to sleep and<br>they don't stop to feed these guys we I<br>mean we trained for this some people<br>trained for this for months they get out<br>of their nest for the very first flight<br>and they fly 12,000 kilometres like and<br>they don't have it they don't know where<br>they're going either cold so just quick<br>comment on cold<br>I actually think Dunedin flats or an<br>amazing model to study cook cold<br>particularly people coming from the<br>tropics because humans don't normally go<br>into cold chronically but you do it's<br>like a rite of passage if you go into a<br>student flat and I would love to study<br>long-term Effects of people coming from<br>tropical places and didn't need in flats<br>one interesting issue is we don't it was<br>now knowing humans don't adapt to cold<br>and tenzin severe cold we actually<br>called faster so if we get put in cold<br>water and this was standing our best man<br>and good mate through uni so we put<br>people in cold water and they just<br>become hypothermic and if you do that<br>every day they actually cool faster<br>they don't defend they don't adapt they<br>habituate so they cease responding the<br>aboriginal do it as well at night they<br>cool down and they just warm up the next<br>day so there's there's large individual<br>differences but we don't we don't Udet<br>this is a really cool cold environment<br>where it went and cold together<br>intermittently I mean it doesn't get<br>colder than that um people study what<br>happens when you go into cold and this<br>is the one thing that responds really<br>well the cold shock the cold shock is<br>actually deadly the the strong cardio<br>respiratory response to cooling and when<br>you put people in the cold this is<br>typically how people do get into the<br>cold in New Zealand they just jump in<br>because most of the water is cold when<br>you study it in research and you lower<br>people into the cold their brain blood<br>flow goes down to critical levels and<br>that's what's thought to be the effect<br>of cold calling<br>so what Chris button did was he dropped<br>people into the flume in the cold water<br>and when you do that and people suddenly<br>go into the cold water and they have to<br>start moving their brain blood flow goes<br>straight back up so you actually get a<br>completely different answer depending<br>how you do your research so if we put it<br>into these more practical context we're<br>better off I'm gonna ask stop there so<br>it's just gonna make one just just<br>elder-tree which I'm not going to be and<br>I just want to make the comment the same<br>thing seems to happen with the brain and<br>blood flow you have bet you out you<br>don't adapt to high altitude you have a<br>terrible night for your brain the goads<br>blood flows up and down all the time you<br>stop breathing you know 60 times an hour<br>a hundred times an hour and you think<br>you're better off after two weeks you're<br>not you just don't know that it's still<br>happening so in many ways when we go to<br>high altitude we think we're adapting in<br>some way as we are but in some important<br>you were right I didn't make it<br>so thank you very much for listening and<br>sorry to be time way up there so thank<br>you<br>just while I'm getting ready here Jim<br>get into homeostasis you've got to think<br>you're you and your three volunteers for<br>Jim Hardy congratulations on your<br>well-deserved thank you for your<br>thoughtful and evocative and insightful<br>inaugural professora lecture I know over<br>50 years ago<br>Phillips middles the founder of the<br>school of physical education published<br>the essential traits of a professor in<br>exploring exercise the environment and<br>their extremes Jim captured these traits<br>which include a passionate interest in<br>an intellectual area of inquiry<br>intellectual Diamond dynamism based on a<br>questioning mind and awareness of public<br>issues and an ability to communicate to<br>different audiences in this evening's<br>lecture we saw Jim's passion shine<br>through as engaged with the effects of<br>internal and external stressors on<br>physiological systems assumptions and<br>arguments about the human body and its<br>capacity of physical stressing revealed<br>Ginny's intellectual dynamism and the<br>woman is to question popular beliefs was<br>apparent in Jim's conceptualization of a<br>Jim's identification of the paradox of<br>the modern building environment is an<br>important contribution to contemporary<br>on the one hand the modern built<br>environment assists our biological need<br>to conserve energy on the other hand the<br>lack of useful transient stresses<br>facilitates the decay of physiological<br>structures and functions in this paradox<br>resides a warning to public policy<br>makers or the unintended consequence of<br>artificially compartmentalizing physical<br>stressors in the built environment due<br>to incorporation of behaviour and by<br>extension culture society and politics<br>into the exercise and physiology<br>equation illustrates his willingness to<br>communicate and engage with diverse<br>audiences Jim has also along has long<br>displayed his communication skills in<br>media commentaries concerning human<br>performance and physiology spills<br>referred to the importance of teaching<br>and mentoring in the role of Professor<br>Tim has extol in this front is<br>supervised more than two scores of PhD<br>and masters students and many of these<br>students have established careers in<br>teaching and researching physiology some<br>of them temperature Nene from afar to<br>BPA today the Otago University Students<br>Association as awarded Jim's supervisor<br>of the year and observing the<br>interaction between Jim and his students<br>one is struck by the collective<br>excitement they generate in their search<br>by understanding lastly Smithers noted<br>that professors peers and demons clearly<br>won this respect as is evident in the<br>large number of citations of his<br>do your peers colleagues and students in<br>the school with you all the best for<br>your Provost Oriole career we know that<br>you will continue to ask deep<br>about physiology human performance<br>physical activity and well-being and<br>that you will continue to lead the<br>search for fresh and creative answers<br>finally your colleagues and school<br>physical education Sport and Exercise<br>Science and the University of Otago look<br>forward to many more years of the<br>service and collegiality that you have<br>given so willingly generously and<br>without a second thought this stage Jim<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
