audience<br>debated the death of the public<br>university we took positions from the<br>university in ruins to the university at<br>various points on different trajectories<br>to ruins the university is zombie the<br>university is hollowed out of its<br>progressive and emancipatory potential<br>if not its will and capacity to critique<br>and the university is still vital<br>platform for critical scholarship and<br>there is projects of positive social<br>change much of the discussion centered<br>on the category of the university last<br>October in a public lecture here on<br>campus Stephan Collini gave a defense of<br>the university by forensic ly<br>deconstructing rankings and their work<br>while referring to different<br>universities and basing much of his<br>argument on the inbuilt and self<br>reinforcing biases towards elite<br>universities in the way that rankings<br>are constructed interpreted and used the<br>university to be protected seemed very<br>much like Oxbridge and the<br>conceptualizing contextualizing debates<br>seemed very British despite these<br>various distance distances I enjoyed the<br>crisper intellectualism of the talk<br>however one listening graduate student<br>reflected afterwards that she was over<br>the category of the university I took<br>this to be an expression of both<br>frustration and fatigue from a student<br>who had previously been a passionate<br>advocate frustration at distanced and<br>highbrow defenses of an institution that<br>affords great privilege to a few and a<br>deep fatigue from waging unwinnable<br>contests against student fee increases<br>and commercializing logics as well as<br>from deconstructed critique as a mode of<br>being as much as a mode of doing<br>the comment ought to be seen less as a<br>throwaway I think and more as a deep<br>challenge to the delegates at this<br>conference to grapple with<br>contradictions unpacked arguments and<br>perhaps shift to a more variegated<br>understanding of the university the<br>images of my own university are more<br>variegated and hopeful than the ivory<br>tower and the insipid brand but you can<br>see must we as English does in his<br>favorable review of colonies book<br>mobilised the figure of the dinner<br>ladies and must we conclude that all we<br>can do is warn that's the challenge I<br>wish to unpack a little today without<br>appearing as a dreadful Quisling<br>delegates at this conference need no<br>reminding of the changes that are<br>gripping our universities and what's at<br>stake abstracted from the abstracts of<br>this week's conference the list is very<br>long it runs from funding priorities to<br>commercialization bibliometrics branding<br>MOOCs internal cost accounting new<br>governance arrangements the collapse of<br>collegial governance and much else<br>besides we are experiencing an avalanche<br>of change to borrow a metaphor from<br>Michael Barbour to whom I will return<br>shortly<br>these changes are of course linked<br>upwards to and constitutive of the great<br>near liberalizing and globalizing<br>processes and geopolitical shifts of the<br>late 20th century to new public<br>managerial concentration of the exercise<br>of state powers and to crises of<br>accumulation and / q√∏ / accumulation as<br>well as to find growing technologies of<br>control that entrepreneurial eyes and<br>responsible eyes academics they are by<br>and large regressive and regrettable and<br>most in this audience have railed<br>against them geographer Nigel thrift<br>prominent blogger on the future of<br>higher government of higher education<br>recently knighted vice-chancellor of<br>Warwick University and possibly the<br>target of Inglis is Quisling quip has<br>summed up the challenges facing the<br>university as a as<br>our government unwillingness to fund<br>university education growing problems of<br>social exclusion growing inequalities<br>between universities constricted<br>possibilities for research careers the<br>rise of a third sector impact<br>assessments and the diminishing capacity<br>of universities to address world<br>problems for academics and students<br>living through them these pressures and<br>changes have gripped at the level of the<br>body and subjectivity as well as<br>practice academics face increasing<br>pressures on time and resources that<br>threatened to death deflect attention<br>from teaching public good research and<br>public engagement they resent the way<br>these changes have driven a particular<br>form of heightened competitiveness so<br>deeply and probably unnecessarily into<br>our knowledge production practices and<br>daily routines but they have changed<br>what we do and what we are undermined<br>our potential and made us wittingly or<br>otherwise the agents of the changes<br>themselves our students protest annually<br>against the increasing fees that they<br>must pay and the loans that they must<br>take out further afield debates about<br>student fees and rising debt levels rage<br>on in the UK Europe and the United<br>States along with concerns about social<br>inequities of access and debt and the<br>rise of multi tier university<br>hierarchies a student you as US student<br>debt passes one trillion dollars these<br>concerns along with a broader analysis<br>of the demise of the u.s. of u.s. higher<br>education<br>thanks Faizal for the five word synopsis<br>have been picked up in the 2014 film<br>ivory tower which premiered at the<br>Sundance Film Festival and is in the<br>mainstream distribution you can watch it<br>on you're a New Zealand flight home for<br>New Zealand delegates these challenges<br>are posed in a landscape short on<br>alternative policy imagination in the<br>months following colonies talk the Vice<br>Chancellors of our two largest<br>universities have defended the<br>universities in the dialogues pages of<br>the U of the New Zealand Herald<br>defending them by advocating a market<br>led drive for excellence<br>targeted at global measures of quality<br>and underpinned by either higher student<br>fees for a reduction in the number of<br>institutions the vision rests on mobile<br>and rational students and academics<br>clearing a quality market ironically<br>perhaps for most interesting in recent<br>post Collini commentary was carried in<br>the notoriously neoliberal business<br>weekly the National Business Review<br>professor Paul Mohan a food scientist<br>director of a Reda Institute centre of<br>research excellence and winner of the<br>2012 prime minister's science prize for<br>contributions to exporting food suggests<br>that along with the predictable<br>establishing closer connections with<br>business universities must attend to<br>broad-based educational experiences<br>really understanding what is meant by<br>the research teaching Nexus and focus on<br>the broader total educational experience<br>and strategically knowing what they<br>stand for<br>while academics again must do the<br>imagining of what this means in practice<br>my first substantive point is that this<br>kind of prescription creates some room<br>in which to vitalize the university but<br>before getting too far ahead of myself<br>my aim today is to seek relief from this<br>fog by reflecting on how we might<br>continue to practice critical<br>scholarship both within the university<br>and from the University and how we might<br>find ways to do university differently<br>as a platform for critical research all<br>while still rallying against disabling<br>change being attentive to and critical<br>of its rationalities and acting to<br>oppose further erosions of institutional<br>autonomy and academic freedom this is<br>what I mean by making a call for a more<br>than oppositional politic critical<br>politics if there is a short answer to<br>these questions it is I think that we<br>are already doing this but really think<br>or talk about what it is that we're<br>doing<br>I begin by suggesting to necessary<br>intellectual moves first rethinking<br>critical practice and then thinking<br>beneath the category of the university<br>it's not now it's not now enough if it<br>ever has been to reveal deconstruct and<br>critique without responsibility that is<br>to indulge as Boland suggests in the<br>discourse which transforms and unmasks<br>other truth claims and replaces them<br>with what he says as a stock a vision of<br>reality this is a form of critique he<br>suggests that is permanent promiscuously<br>and these are his words connected with<br>cynicism and risks becoming a sort of<br>permanent and variegated opposition to<br>different forms of constraint it risks<br>taking for granted the critic and<br>conscience clause enshrined in New<br>Zealand's Education Act as defense of<br>academic freedom or treating it or<br>treating it as a right to practice only<br>a passively disengaged and<br>deconstructive critique it might be more<br>interesting to ask what kind of critical<br>practice is now possible or meaningful<br>Matheson Russell yesterday suggested<br>that the court that the cause of critic<br>and conscience authorizes universities<br>and its academics to be active political<br>participants and gives them the freedom<br>to question and test received wisdom<br>advanced different ideas criticize<br>public powers and to hold them to<br>account these are his words from another<br>cover from a publication we might go<br>further to suggest that the clause<br>imposes an individual and collective<br>responsibility to do this at a time when<br>the state no longer sits so obviously as<br>the actor that might respond to<br>criticism and make material any<br>alternative thinking with or without<br>explicitly articulated recommendations<br>from researchers for example and public<br>choice Theory presents alternative<br>thinking as narrowly self-interested but<br>recommendation to policy is no longer a<br>simple option here<br>as a geographer in a science faculty I<br>occasionally have this conversation with<br>the ecologists and other environmental<br>scientists who cannot understand often<br>why the government does not act on their<br>science arguably as social scientists we<br>should know better the state does not<br>make policy and command resources and<br>investments decisions as it once did<br>while in the new state we are<br>researchers deliverers of evidence by<br>instrumental means not keepers of a<br>deeper knowledge we are of a sector<br>often lumped together with crown<br>research institutes in the New Zealand<br>context we are a group defined up with<br>definable common consistent and rational<br>rationally articulated stakes we are to<br>be consulted rather than to be trusted<br>with the capacity or moral authority to<br>define alternative national or community<br>goods or to argue from anything other<br>than from sectarian positions this<br>suggests I suspect that we need to find<br>new actors with whom to engage and new<br>ways of engaging with the state while<br>still building concepts and still<br>critiquing at a distance thinking deeper<br>within the university in much of my my<br>own scholarship I used the work of<br>Timothy Mitchell Michelle :<br>and even Nigel thrift to deconstruct the<br>category of the economy economies are<br>messy and I have begun to use metaphors<br>such as that of assemblage to draw<br>attention to their partiality and<br>temporariness as well as to the act of<br>assembling of actors objects relations<br>practices regulation investment<br>trajectories objects and so on that<br>constitute them through such a lens a<br>university might be seen as less the<br>fully autonomous singular preordained<br>and somewhat paradoxical configuration<br>of disciplines and unconstrained<br>academics and students who are safely<br>located away on the hill above the town<br>and above the state often in practice<br>they are looser and more Multiverse<br>assemblages of different types of<br>students and academics knowledge<br>productions<br>missions political projects of<br>enlightenment disciplinary<br>configurations and so on even before we<br>throw in the student learns loans<br>research institutes interdisciplinary<br>networks research offices<br>commercializing units and HR PR and<br>staff service centers of today's<br>universities along with the performative<br>along with its performative and<br>calculated objects X FTEs kpi's rankings<br>h indices rates of return and so on and<br>of course universities are located in<br>different places with different<br>histories statuses and student<br>catchments and with different funding<br>and regulatory regimes any university is<br>a complex of variegated institution and<br>all actualized universities are<br>different assemblages of often different<br>elements the roar of the avalanche of<br>change contains discordant and/or<br>context specific notes arising from<br>different actualized neoliberalism's<br>differences in the way that the<br>pressures play out among them within<br>different universities the equity gains<br>from mass education new targeted equity<br>programs and the enduring absences<br>silences and class gendered and other<br>privileges of the Academy along with<br>various romanticization that swirl<br>around those in the arts and humanities<br>need to be wary of seeing universities<br>only from where they inhabit inhabit<br>them and from the type of university<br>that they inhabit without actively<br>researching what goes on in medical<br>schools science labs law libraries<br>ICT Suites and so on and engaging with<br>the different projects of social good<br>that are often launched and developed in<br>those spaces we risk privilege in the<br>role of the university as critique of<br>power in domains of economy and social<br>politics only in my part of the<br>university I see laboratories modeling<br>programs field machines and the budgets<br>that my students fund to sustain them<br>I also encounter some of the many<br>projects of the Enlightenment still at<br>work in different parts of different of<br>different in different parts of the<br>university<br>despite the assault on institutional<br>autonomy and researcher initiated<br>research that threatened the capacity to<br>exercise academic freedom by identifying<br>in the 2013 document and Avalanche is<br>coming a joint publication by higher<br>education corporation pearson the<br>Institute for Public Policy Research and<br>universities UK Michael barber put the<br>question of unbundling of university<br>practices firmly in the middle of the<br>Avalanche although clearly designed as<br>an intervention to bring into being that<br>of which it speaks and to act as a<br>betrayal for the privatization of<br>universities the document points to the<br>breaking up contracting out<br>privatization and globalization of<br>research teaching curriculum funding<br>conferring degrees all of those<br>dimensions that constitute the<br>university unbundling is the language of<br>the asset Stricker's of the 1980s who<br>sought to create money profits from<br>socially created rents and release<br>unbundling will intensify many of the<br>pressures on the university however in<br>his conclusion to the forward Lawrence<br>Summers observed that the future of the<br>university belongs to those who rebuttal<br>creatively for they will find that they<br>had reinvented higher education for the<br>21st century very biblical kind of<br>language rhe bundling then is a<br>curiously derived hopeful metaphor<br>at least in my take on this for the<br>university and leads me to ask whether<br>it is possible to find and learn from<br>expert examples of creative rebounding<br>or alternative ways of performing<br>critique or simply living with these<br>changes on at least partially different<br>terms the third mission is a term used<br>in EU policy to refer to a broadly<br>interpreted raft of university<br>engagements with various public in<br>research on its rise in New Zealand<br>about which you will hear more later<br>today<br>Chris Shore Nigel how√≠s John Morgan and<br>myself we've encountered a dominant<br>variant of the third mission although<br>unnamed as such it reduces towards the<br>pursuit of external revenue through<br>commercializing and marketizing<br>relations this mission resides in a new<br>language for knowing and performing the<br>university commercialization units and<br>research institutes new research offers<br>practices and expertise and their<br>proliferation and a host of new<br>subjectivity<br>we hypothesize that it may be<br>supplanting more or less subtly the<br>first and second missions of the<br>university teaching and public with<br>research however we also encountered<br>diversity in the way it is articulated<br>with the other two missions across the<br>universities of New Zealand and some<br>interesting deployments of it<br>these included commitments to more<br>engaged in dialogical pedagogy in<br>science education and business schools<br>associated with the centres of research<br>excellence and new programs of science<br>and enterprise respectively whilst<br>lacking critical reflexivity and<br>demanding the sort of critique levelled<br>yesterday by Karina Balaban at the<br>performative figure of the knowledge<br>worker in this teaching these programmes<br>take seriously both preparing their<br>students for an altered world and<br>experimenting with learning we also<br>encountered multiple cross faculty and<br>cross institutional initiatives among<br>scientists deeply committed to<br>identifying opportunities to do<br>fundamental science as well as a<br>determination to engage publicly albeit<br>in a communication sort of way we<br>encountered see safe the Center for<br>sustainable agriculture food energy and<br>environment where I spent a day three<br>weeks ago as a casual visitor<br>press-ganged into being quiz master in<br>the compulsory collectively completed<br>daily morning tea quiz from the Otago<br>Daily Times that they all set to do on a<br>daily basis I witnessed the welcome to<br>the group of a new Fulbright ma scholar<br>one of three currently working at the<br>centre where there are also currently 14<br>PhD students and four postdocs all<br>working on questions of socio<br>environmental politics in the words of<br>its founder Hugh Campbell at was<br>launched informally in 2001 on a<br>conjunction of possibilities to pursue<br>politically motivated research on things<br>green and things social he notes that<br>there are complex institutional's there<br>was complex institutional stuff going on<br>and with the research group in the media<br>sorry and with the research group in the<br>media they formed a virtual Center he<br>adds that if we hadn't been quite so<br>successful we would have got into<br>formalized in 2006 see safe has has<br>dedicated itself to a particular<br>socio-environmental and food politics<br>and to engaging that politics with<br>economic actors engaging that politics<br>with economic actors in agri-food whilst<br>building a genuine global leadership in<br>rural sociology and agri-food studies at<br>the core of its approach has been a<br>community ethic commitments to students<br>and a real politic of engaging<br>critically and creatively with economic<br>and policy actors and New Zealand's<br>cloying economic nationalism as<br>foundation<br>intellectual foundations for supporting<br>rural communities so that politics is<br>directed to that the quiz and a regular<br>column in the newspaper along with<br>alumni networks but it's student focus<br>have created are as you suggest pivotal<br>to the center's success he directs he in<br>interview he directed our attention to<br>the the value of these alumni networks<br>in generating and new contracts to keep<br>the center running so there is a game<br>being played here by an entrepreneurial<br>academic but again played connected to a<br>particular politics it has not always<br>been easy to survive the pressures of<br>competitive soft funding for C safe and<br>half a dozen other similar centers<br>across New Zealand's universities it is<br>not easy to have staff on short term<br>contracts every leader of one of these<br>centers to whom I've talked has has<br>spoken of being awakened in the early<br>hours of the morning worrying about<br>their staff and whether they will have<br>jobs<br>it's not easy then for staff staff on<br>short-term contracts to negotiate<br>complex arrangements with departments<br>overacts and FTEs these centers are<br>always skillfully and cleverly crafted<br>into the established structure of the<br>university and to be continually writing<br>funding brids and all the while under<br>increasing pressures from universities<br>to get contracts and squeezed by new<br>managerial technologies and the<br>encroachment of various forms of what<br>might be called exhortation expertise<br>and go and get us new contracts and we<br>will show you how and we will tie your<br>hands and we will possibly tell you<br>now paya tomorrow Madonna the Center for<br>of research excellence to which Tracy<br>McIntosh introduced us yesterday is<br>another example of a political project<br>of knowledge production thriving in and<br>across universities it has initiated<br>funded and stuarti the range of critical<br>scholarship research and community<br>engagement and built a very different<br>form of third mission in practice and a<br>very different ethos of critical<br>practice it has found transformative<br>ways to tick the boxes and to speak the<br>language of new public management when<br>required while its capability to do all<br>of that all this is born of a complex<br>politics and related resources that are<br>New Zealand specific it demonstrates<br>that academic freedom and critical<br>engagement can be exercised differently<br>in my own work I've been encouraged by<br>law and Aria and Gibson Graham to<br>practice a more muted politics in my<br>case it's more muted of potentiality by<br>engaging with others to know otherwise<br>together with my research collaborators<br>we've sought to build what we're calling<br>an active in active research one of the<br>features of this work is to run<br>workshops and Chatham House engagements<br>with different policy community and<br>economic actors not to lecture or to<br>question them but to discuss questions<br>in our terms rather than those of<br>stakeholder consultation or<br>dissemination to discuss our concepts<br>the terms these terms our terms our<br>experimentation non sectarianism and<br>engagement and a willingness to engage<br>with unfamiliar ideas and unfamiliar<br>others often under Chatham House Rules<br>our project is pointedly political to<br>learn influence cocoapod to learn<br>influenced and co-produced knowledge and<br>to foster call activity and collective<br>institutions that is to make a relevance<br>for our political work and create<br>conceptual quote and create conceptual<br>we developed this approach from work on<br>the building research capability in the<br>social sciences initiative generously<br>funded more than ten years ago now to<br>build networks across disciplines<br>institutions and generations at the<br>national level to foster new research<br>agendas and to enhance an institutional<br>profile for social science a combination<br>of accident and creative leadership<br>resulted in a trajectory for this<br>initiative in which it took its own<br>direction guided by those committed<br>enough to engage those in those involved<br>over delivered on deliverables and<br>reporting requirements and used the<br>freedom that that created to focus<br>attention on encouraging and supporting<br>specific national networks of scholars<br>Maori researchers early career<br>researchers Pacifica researchers nu<br>setta researchers and graduate students<br>it spawned a later initiative isse oxide<br>for his intern given birth to a set of<br>about 22 the active and thematic<br>research networks that assemble<br>researchers from across the country and<br>across the disciplines for regular cyber<br>meetings and occasional conferences no<br>longer funded these networks are<br>generally led by early to mid career<br>researchers and are beginning to pay<br>dividends in the form of journal<br>specialist issues and new research<br>agendas they also involve academics in<br>conversations with ministry officials<br>activists and independent community and<br>NGO researchers a steering committee<br>maintains the website and continues to<br>engage with government ministries on<br>issues of research funding and social<br>science capability as well as particular<br>questions we are here today as a result<br>of two successive EU funded<br>multinational research projects that<br>have examined the future of universities<br>urge and unique both have involves<br>significant forms of funding and has<br>been made possible by the mobilisation<br>of heavy CDs of prominent critical<br>scholars careful analysis and strategic<br>creative interpretation or<br>he of the --use Europe making aims and<br>new manageress language and skillful and<br>skillful grants person ship urge was<br>co-funded by by Morse they are Ministry<br>of research Science and Technology in<br>its old name under its science exchange<br>program and our new Ministry of business<br>innovation and employment has supported<br>this conference I'm not sure that<br>critical theorizing of the knowledge<br>economy and Industry training in<br>universities were ever part of the<br>funders visions but the projects have<br>over delivered on their promises to<br>engage with the economic actors involved<br>to produce research and to present<br>present opportunities for PhD students<br>these projects and these projects are<br>not narrowly subversive or some sneaky<br>sleight of hand rather careful attention<br>to the details of the contract and<br>over-delivering have facilitated further<br>critical knowledge production as well as<br>an engagement via critical ideas with<br>economic policy within and beyond the<br>universities the global higher ed web<br>blog edited by Chris olds and Susan<br>Robertson was established in 2007 it<br>claims to receive approximately ten to<br>fourteen thousand visits a month from<br>people associated with consulting firms<br>credit rating agencies these are its<br>words foundations and funding councils<br>higher education associations the media<br>ministries and associated development<br>agencies multilateral agencies and<br>universities including students<br>administrators and faculty and these<br>from all around the world but blog<br>Kerry's entries from many of these<br>sources and has defined a research field<br>and a space for engagement founded on<br>critical thinking it is paved the way<br>for Chris and Susan to access figures<br>rooms and presentation platforms to<br>which critical academics are rarely ever<br>given access in their latest engagement<br>the lordship launch of the MOOC<br>globalizing higher education and<br>research for the knowledge economy there<br>again deploying a mass technology to<br>blur in a positive way the boundaries<br>between critical<br>scholarship and public knowledge in my<br>own school academics are involved in a<br>project to revitalize New Zealand's<br>rivers called Tara raw it is built on<br>community ties and funded by the next<br>foundation a philanthropic funder of<br>projects that aims to create in its<br>terms a legacy of environmental and<br>educational excellence for future<br>generations of New Zealanders the<br>project is socio-environmental and the<br>knowledge production the project the<br>political project is socio-environmental<br>and the knowledge production process<br>pushes boundaries of accepted<br>interdisciplinary science it is<br>explicitly political aiming to clean up<br>environments redesign regulation and<br>empower communities through distributive<br>democracy now I've got those things in a<br>conclusion then if there is a direct<br>target for this talk it is the argument<br>that would identify barbers avalanche<br>plot it's likely track through<br>institutional autonomy assume all is<br>lost and proclaimed the death of the<br>University by neoliberalism it would<br>squeeze out of the story University<br>based critical projects such as those<br>that I have listed fortunately this may<br>be a straw target three years on from<br>death of the from the death of a public<br>university symposium we have enjoyed a<br>debate over institutional autonomy as an<br>historically and geographically<br>contingent field of struggle rather than<br>a right and the papers in this<br>conference are asking more fine-grained<br>questions of the constituent elements of<br>the category of the University this is<br>an encouraging context in which to make<br>an argument for a more than oppositional<br>politics that works with whatever<br>institutional autonomy is available to<br>exercise academic freedom engage with<br>publics and secure the university is a<br>platform for academics to frame their<br>own critical questions to demonstrate<br>the value of their work and renew or<br>improve for contract the social contract<br>between University and its publics yet<br>whilst keeping the more pointed<br>criticality very truly alive perhaps it<br>offers an answer to the narrower<br>question of what the public gets for its<br>money but we're always that's always<br>posed to us and perhaps it offers a<br>means to take back the university using<br>gifts and grounds terms I will finish by<br>pointing to a few tentative strategies<br>that we might be able to draw from these<br>examples practicing critique in and from<br>the University requires continued<br>forensic analysis of of university<br>practices and continued critique of its<br>repurposing this pillar of practice<br>should be matched by continued attention<br>to teaching and to shaping environments<br>and opportunities for valuing infusing<br>and learning with students and<br>colleagues<br>I'm not sure about Hugh Campbell's<br>reference to social capital but the<br>morning tease with the Otago Daily Times<br>quiz our identity for me and deeply<br>affirming at the risk of replacing one<br>form of critical conceit that of<br>offering a sharper analysis of reality<br>with another that of imagining academics<br>is actually making a difference the<br>examples I cite invite engagement with<br>publics what I term an inactive critical<br>scholarship this requires a different<br>critical disposition and perhaps even an<br>unfamiliar form of academic<br>entrepreneurialism in regard to<br>mobilizing resources to make but<br>possible here each of the examples are<br>believers enlightening there is<br>something about New Zealand here also<br>indeed there is always a situatedness of<br>a political potential and practice of<br>critical thought in New Zealand this<br>lies in the very institutional thinness<br>and smallness that on the one hand<br>produces our limited intellectual<br>culture and the capacity for governments<br>to change stuff we heard a bit about<br>yesterday but on the other hand gives us<br>the sort of access s access underpinning<br>my my workshop worked by thinking about<br>criticality more politically we might<br>work this as a field of potentiality we<br>should act as Mathison Russell suggested<br>three years ago as if the University and<br>state were committed to Education Act<br>two the Education Act and to add to its<br>own visions missions and plans<br>this might include embolden in our thee<br>seas by celebrating our mutual interests<br>in the quality of critique which is the<br>university's competitive advantage in<br>rankings and is the rent that Barbara<br>and colleagues would seek to unbundle<br>and flog this seems ground for an<br>embolden alliance after all there is<br>still agency and VC's a critical of the<br>loss of institutional autonomy and<br>genuinely committed I believe to<br>research excellence they get to make<br>decisions and can and do so differently<br>in different universities they can<br>choose to<br>accept or reject the recommendations of<br>management consultants to centralize<br>administrative services just as Dean's<br>can choose to support or caution<br>publicly against such decisions it's not<br>impossible that they may frame these<br>commitments in terms different to<br>external research revenue there are many<br>in this room who perform this politics<br>within the Union and beyond all this<br>might be understood using Gibson Grahams<br>terminology as part of a long-term<br>project to take back the university for<br>her taking back involved standing<br>largely outside of the corporate world<br>and creating something different<br>perhaps in the university case<br>Imagineering like right Greenwood and<br>Bowden our trust University modeled on<br>Mondragon in my work it means inhabiting<br>and use the new spaces and exploiting<br>the critical potentiality of the<br>University differently as Tracy McIntosh<br>suggested yesterday for some this might<br>involve a more direct engagement with<br>others in different communities as well<br>as state and capitalist actors it might<br>mean a creative politics that can be<br>practiced alongside or even in strategic<br>alignment with critical theorizing the<br>example suggests that we are doing this<br>but don't talk enough about it or indeed<br>theorize it for others politics is more<br>overtly for others politics is more<br>overtly resistant or may remain our<br>library or or may remain a library or a<br>laboratory based exercise running from<br>painstaking forensic deconstruction all<br>the way to scientific measurement the<br>core of the university might be seen as<br>the capability to continue to ask the<br>questions I suspect that is the core<br>gripped by forces that would direct our<br>expectation expertise to questions posed<br>by others this may require more and more<br>of a creativity displayed by those cited<br>in the examples the university is not<br>dead until its academics no longer frame<br>for questions that they asked<br>perhaps in the meantime it's a good<br>thing<br>I guess to rattle some of its privileges<br>and some of its exclusive practices to<br>betray myself finally as Angelina Jolie<br>rather than Quisling I'll leave you with<br>the Raymond Williams line but to be<br>truly radical is to make hope possible<br>that was the wonderful thank you so much<br>and in France the last session of the<br>day today very nice indeed because we<br>have people from the Ministry and the<br>funding lot is in New Zealand for<br>daughters and you've set out a<br>particular politics which I know you've<br>been very active in developing with<br>others in New Zealand and which is an<br>export that gives you and also make more<br>clear to the rest of us in the world so<br>thank you very much for doing that<br>have we got some questions we've got<br>five minutes<br>yes<br>so so what we do if you came down is its<br>impact it's becoming a management device<br>it was look at universities of the UK<br>and our pinkie making packed case<br>studies so the decks for surge<br>situation<br>yes<br>yeah I think this in many ways they're<br>similar questions the the impact one is<br>is an intro is is interesting because<br>our our variants our PBR F out there<br>enter the performance assessment<br>exercise is has known about impact since<br>it obviously since it was first<br>developed in the UK and as far as we<br>know it's not been rolled out over us<br>for the next PBR F round and they had<br>they have had the opportunity to do that<br>and to specify what impact might be some<br>of this may actually filter into<br>directions to the panels a bit later a<br>nice I wonder about that I wonder<br>whether our rather purist new public<br>managers are waking up to the costs of<br>some of these things and whether it's<br>actually worth it but I also think that<br>two comments you made it it's a it is an<br>ongoing field of struggle and that's the<br>point I think that's the very point of<br>the whole talk in many ways these things<br>we don't fix these things so we just<br>continue to struggle and it's a it's a<br>feel that it's a particular field of<br>struggle so in in our context the panels<br>are empowered to make decisions they are<br>not simple what's the right word I can't<br>think of it and cyphers of the<br>technology they can make decisions so<br>that some of what I did today I would be<br>able to articulate into it into a set of<br>claims about impact and perhaps find the<br>old kind of thing to put that in the old<br>kind of piece of evidence to demonstrate<br>that they defeat being some kind of<br>impacts so I think even in an impact<br>world it does introduce another game of<br>being able to demonstrate this kind of<br>stuff so I haven't had to live through<br>it so I live the dark side of it very<br>good question how do we get the<br>network's to expand and and occupy wider<br>wider spaces one of the ways one of the<br>ways that that they have found some<br>purchase to get beyond themselves is<br>being able to not simply to name<br>themselves in in research grant<br>applications in NSS in performance<br>assessments annual performance reviews<br>and so on as being part of this network<br>of being able to mobilise the arrival of<br>of international scholars to invite<br>scholars to give presentations to get to<br>interest people internationally how do<br>you how do you generate money for these<br>networks I'm not quite so sure again<br>within the structures in which we live<br>you're able to demonstrate that you've<br>got multiple people involved multiple<br>disciplines multiple multiple<br>universities so you are able to leverage<br>off of that one would hope that a<br>Jodie's Dean's and we have been to the<br>Dean to get some funding for one of<br>these one of these networks begins to<br>look they begin to look stable and and<br>something to to actually invest in so<br>it's again an ongoing struggle and I<br>creatively bundling at one level a cheap<br>metaphorical trick sounds good you kind<br>of have a title but another at another I<br>think that many of us the examples that<br>I cited are actually bundling up<br>particular dimensions of being of of<br>what a university is in new ways into<br>into a network the kind of particularly<br>collegiality and this is an answer to<br>question over there as well they're<br>bundling up and performing collegiality<br>different differently giving academics<br>an opportunity to to discuss to get<br>outside of their administrative frames<br>which are often now no longer<br>disciplinary in this part of the world<br>so there re re bundling discipline their<br>rebounding<br>there's forms of academic commitment<br>there rebonding the student academic<br>relationship because many of these it<br>networks are held together by student<br>participation as well grad students so<br>there is a redundant so I think it does<br>stand scrutiny from that perspective but<br>also I also like the notion because of<br>the way it plays round with and never<br>lunch is coming opening up completely<br>different way of thinking about the<br>politics of home within universities so<br>thank you very much and we move straight<br>into the next session so thank you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
