Nick Lewis and<br>associate professor of geography at the<br>University of Auckland I have the<br>pleasure to invite him to this interview<br>because of his expertise in geography of<br>education particularly the higher<br>education internationalization of higher<br>education and he has extensive<br>experience in the Asia Pacific region<br>and I have a few questions to ask dr.<br>Nick Lewis what do you think the trends<br>in higher education had changed over the<br>past two decades in the war<br>I suspect the the the major pressures<br>bring brought to bear on on higher<br>education are those associated with<br>globalizing pressures those associated<br>with new demands from from governments<br>from States as to what they want the<br>universities to do for them in their<br>national development projects or in<br>building knowledge economies the<br>increasing mobility of students and<br>research agendas and research monies<br>across the world and all all of these<br>things<br>I guess brought to bear on on the way<br>that universities operate and the<br>experiences of academics and the<br>experiences of students within<br>universities so a lot of change it's<br>commonly simply reduced to questions of<br>big bogey person in the room<br>neoliberalism as as universities change<br>their responses to changing government<br>structures to changing funding levels<br>that if you really want to you can shoot<br>them all back to - neoliberalism but I<br>don't think you have to do that we can<br>find much more kind of specific details<br>about the changes and do you think that<br>the changes are similar in the<br>developing war and the develop war it's<br>an interesting question it's very<br>difficult for us in in the developed<br>world<br>the global north and and it's outposts<br>in places like New Zealand and Australia<br>to to really understand what's going on<br>in other parts of the world and I don't<br>think we have a very strong sense of<br>those changes I don't think we have a<br>very strong sense of where they were<br>before the changes started so you it's<br>very difficult to to measure change if<br>you don't know where things came from in<br>the first instance so the literature's<br>not great my own experiences I noticed<br>you said that I have extensive<br>experience I suspect you are overstating<br>that somewhat I I spent some time<br>working with a group of academics from<br>around the East Asian region in in<br>Singapore and for me that was a real<br>learning experience as I came to<br>understand how universities are<br>structured in that part of the world<br>before I started that project I had no<br>sense of what a national university was<br>are the experience is different yes they<br>must be because they all start from<br>different places there are the flows of<br>funding are different the legislative<br>structures under which universities<br>operator are different the expectations<br>of universities and and what work they<br>might do for the nation are different<br>so yes fundamental differences yet at<br>the same time a range of policy<br>mobilities if you like in terms of the<br>but different ways that that university<br>should be managed and run those sorts of<br>ideas are spreading very rapidly from<br>places in in the developed world into<br>African and East Asian South Asian<br>universities very often not as a as a<br>sort of top-down trickle into those<br>places but they're very often into as as<br>universities reach up to to grab things<br>to reposition themselves<br>in local politics reposition themselves<br>in relation to global rankings of<br>universities and so you get a lot of<br>yeah you get a lot of movement but<br>there's a fundamental difference in<br>terms of the work that universities are<br>supposed to perform or expected in the<br>way in which they perform it as well as<br>how they organized and most of the<br>academic literature that we came across<br>in graduate school of education most<br>graduate school of education in Europe<br>and perhaps in Asia as well most of us<br>Scholar talked about the negative output<br>of these changes but I would think that<br>you might have experienced some of the<br>positive output of these changes can you<br>give an example in the Asia Pacific of<br>anything is that positive yes I think so<br>I I mean it's it's it's my belief yes<br>all these changes are happening and by<br>and large they are regressive and I said<br>yesterday regressive and regrettable but<br>if you are if you're subjected to those<br>changes to wallow around in anxiety or<br>or self-pity if you like it in the<br>Universities which are on the basis of<br>it or which are in in reality very<br>privileged places very privileged places<br>to work very privileged places to study<br>to live an experience for us so for some<br>time so if you start from a position<br>that they are privileged start from a<br>position that the universities are not<br>simply being wiped out by changes and<br>they're still having a significant<br>amount of autonomy sit then provide a<br>lot of academic freedom still no one<br>tells me for example what to do I mean<br>there lots of pressures on me and I'm<br>highly privileged at it at a leading<br>University in the Asia Pacific and it's<br>not the same for people in other<br>universities we've put all that aside I<br>think you can begin to see examples and<br>in the New Zealand case for example I I<br>talked about enough I of tomorrow<br>McDonough which is a center of research<br>excellence in basically University of<br>Auckland but in in New Zealand where<br>they're doing really in<br>interesting things funding new projects<br>making new possibilities for young<br>researchers connecting with a range of<br>community actors developing very<br>interesting Maori projects around things<br>to do with the economy things to do with<br>community now it would be wrong to<br>suggest that this was created by the by<br>neoliberalism all or some of the things<br>that we blame for the bad changes but it<br>has occurred at the same time and it is<br>connected and it is a kind of positive<br>outcome I also cited another another<br>example that I've been involved with<br>which is the building research<br>capability in the Social Sciences<br>Network which in a sense is a<br>consequence of the changes as<br>governments ought to to think about how<br>it could deal with some of the some of<br>the barriers to fostering capability<br>within the disciplines that have been<br>put in place by the changes so how to<br>deal with that they in they funded<br>across across the university cross<br>institutional cross generational cross<br>disciplinary program of network building<br>where the networks that got built where<br>Maori research networks Pacifica<br>research networks early career and new<br>settler our kind of networks that begin<br>to fill in some of the gaps and create<br>some of the connections that have been<br>ripped out of the universities because<br>of the changes so you get these sorts of<br>things here so changes and challenges<br>actually create space for emerging for<br>for new knowledge they do create they<br>long as they're not too extreme so that<br>they tie your hands and you can't do<br>anything new and and these examples are<br>drawn from a New Zealand context of<br>course which is is privileged you<br>mentioned earlier about your experience<br>with Singapore and I<br>would like to ask you about your latest<br>paper published last year about the<br>mobility and desire international<br>student in aspirational Singapore can<br>you give me a little bit of background<br>or the fighting in that papers yeah I<br>talked to a wee bit about it I should<br>acknowledge in the first instance that I<br>was Theodore from that paper and my<br>colleagues were of indicee do and<br>Francis Collins actually led led the<br>work and let the writing of the paper<br>the the paper itself is fascinating<br>because it emerged from that project I<br>was telling you about a project called<br>GU ism which was I can't remember what<br>the acronym stands stood for but I'm<br>sure University was in there and<br>globalization was in there but it<br>involved researchers from across the<br>region and brought them together in<br>Singapore Singapore lots of money so<br>it's what lavishly funded I probably<br>should say that the Singaporean<br>government wouldn't maybe not like that<br>too much but what a consequence of this<br>is that we managed to actually probably<br>create the the biggest data set on on<br>changing experiences among students in<br>particular that's been created around<br>the internationalization of fund of<br>education so we talked to students we<br>talked to university leaders we we did a<br>questionnaire so we have a lot of kind<br>of quantitative material to to draw upon<br>and the some of the I guess what the<br>paper did was was challenged challenged<br>the presumption that all the decisions<br>that are made around these processes of<br>internationalization by by students<br>challenged the presumption that though<br>those emerge from rational choice<br>decision-making processes and that those<br>processes are how we might imagine them<br>if we're not the student if we're the<br>university or the researcher from the<br>outside or maybe even the parent who's<br>paying for them imagines that students<br>are doing certain things<br>because they they read the rationality<br>offer of a predefined grid now what we<br>were able to find of course is lots of<br>different motivations but but but no<br>discrete motivation no discrete<br>independent motivations that sort of add<br>up to something or influence it it's all<br>a mix and it's about aspiration and and<br>desire and students positioning<br>themselves within their family within<br>their national economy<br>within the global economy and global<br>labor markets a range of different<br>aspirations at work that are very<br>difficult to reduce to one on one kind<br>of not one on one that's the wrong way<br>of saying it that are difficult to<br>reduce to single variables to explain<br>things so they're always contingent and<br>always dependent upon the individual the<br>individual each of the individuals has a<br>range of different effects that work on<br>different socialization processes and so<br>you have you have students who were<br>happen to some of the students I talked<br>to in Osaka who discovered comics they<br>were there because they fell in love<br>with Japanese comics at at an early<br>stage others who had a desire to work in<br>a foreign office others who just had a<br>desire to know more about the region and<br>okay if I make one more comment there<br>one of the really interesting things<br>that it taught me this project maybe<br>less the paper itself but the project<br>it's that in this part of the world we<br>come to understand internationalization<br>as a as an industry New Zealand<br>government New Zealand universities<br>seeking to fund their activities by<br>selling education to international<br>students and we come to see it all about<br>that being all about English language<br>acquisition but of course large numbers<br>of students move not in order to study<br>English in fact increasingly in order to<br>study China Mandarin so they're moving<br>from the US and moving around the East<br>Asian region for that purpose all they<br>may be moving to position themselves for<br>jobs in in Japanese<br>in Japanese global corporations and so<br>on so it's a great deal of complexity<br>and in a Singaporean case they they<br>haven't charged their international<br>students so it's about developing<br>Singapore as opposed to you know making<br>money to fund domestic education or for<br>back up in international students lots<br>of complexity and and desire is<br>something that will endure and and<br>Frances are interested in there's a<br>something that's inside the body inside<br>the mind inside a range of cues social<br>cues and so on I know that you have<br>experience teaching international<br>student here in New Zealand and all<br>supervise international students as well<br>so what is your learning poi by working<br>with international students from<br>different cultural backgrounds who<br>travel a long way here and how is it<br>different from what you've seen in<br>Singapore yeah that's an interesting<br>question I the second part of the<br>question would be more difficult to<br>answer because I haven't spent time in<br>Singaporean classrooms or with with so<br>the work we did was very short-term kind<br>of interviews are very difficult to get<br>a handle on those kinds of things but I<br>will will say some things about engaging<br>with international students in in my own<br>work work and it's it's always a great<br>pleasure but a pleasure that comes with<br>a number of challenges of course the<br>challenge is we we often think about the<br>challenges from a student's perspective<br>there are also challenges from from the<br>academics perspective working with with<br>a student who's whose cultural<br>background is different whose response<br>to whose response in supervisory<br>relationships for example is very<br>different it that I mean it's it's<br>wonderful but I always feel awkward for<br>example that my international students<br>give me gifts you know and am I supposed<br>to reciprocate it I've actually never<br>asked anyone within the university am I<br>supposed to even accept those gifts<br>and I do accept the gifts because it's a<br>cultural practice in it it's fun<br>and look there's something around the<br>way that you know that our British<br>Traditions I guess around the Academy<br>and we're just doing it now at old<br>government house having a beer with<br>students after many of our students are<br>non-drinkers from international students<br>how do you replicate that moment of that<br>really rich moment of social of<br>engagement with a graduate student that<br>occurs within a within a pub or a bar or<br>something when you're after working<br>you're relaxing and it's a moment a<br>moment of rich learning that doesn't get<br>replicated so easily when you're working<br>with students who are who don't drink<br>and so there are there are lots of lots<br>of little things there and of course the<br>the language issues of of writing and<br>are always difficult it takes a lot<br>longer to work with an international<br>student often if their second language<br>student your commitment as an academic<br>has to be stronger just as the students<br>commitment but I do i do marvel at the<br>way that people can learn in a different<br>languages you know I can barely string<br>together 15 words in French or you know<br>a few words in Maadi but that's about it<br>yeah but I really enjoy your your<br>sharing of experience and I believe that<br>once a student international student<br>decided to go abroad to study is also<br>very terrorist you know a lot take a lot<br>of courage to travel but once a study in<br>one place they probably become friends<br>of the country for life and I think that<br>the experience working with professors<br>in another academic culture is probably<br>along it's really precious for Experian<br>for international students and thank you<br>for being with us today<br>thank you you're most welcome and you<br>know anytime it's always a pleasure to<br>to to work with students and to work was<br>sort of such a talented group as the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
