Dean of the Business School, outlines the role of education in delivering the skills needed to thrive in a shifting world of work.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>well much of the discussion at the<br>moment seems to be around technological<br>changes with the implication being that<br>advances in artificial intelligence and<br>robotics and other fields are really<br>going to change the kind of work that<br>that we do and potentially put a lot of<br>people out of work but there are a lot<br>of other forces that we need to be<br>thinking about and some of those are<br>demographic and because they're<br>demographic forces they take place over<br>a longer period of time so they've been<br>more invisible to people so one that's<br>very important particularly in developed<br>economies is the population is aging and<br>a smaller proportion of the population<br>is of working age and the participation<br>rate is declining another factor that we<br>often don't think about is the movement<br>in a number of large populous countries<br>like China India Russia towards more<br>open markets and because of that there<br>are literally hundreds of millions of<br>new people competing in a global labor<br>market if you combine those two things<br>you think about a number of developing<br>countries that are opening their doors<br>and relying an immigration to fill some<br>of their labor market which is creating<br>a much more diverse workforce than we<br>would have had previously and then of<br>course on top of that we have all of the<br>disruption that arises from different<br>digital platforms the ability to create<br>social networks that truly span the<br>globe the ability to work from any from<br>any location and that's really having an<br>impact on the kinds of jobs that people<br>do it's fragmenting markets it's taking<br>jobs and sort of breaking them up into<br>smaller pieces so there are a number of<br>forces that are changing the nature of<br>work and many of these are technological<br>and orientation but a lot of them art as<br>well<br>so the result of all of this is nearly a<br>perfect storm for today's graduate you<br>have a number of fields where there are<br>jobs wanting and no people to fill them<br>in other fields you have recent<br>graduates who are employed but they<br>aren't using their full skillset and we<br>also have a number of people who are<br>truly frightened because they are<br>employed but they see an end to the kind<br>of career that they're currently in and<br>that they need to move on to something<br>else and they don't know how to do it so<br>the primary issue is how to better<br>prepare young people for jobs that don't<br>yet exist and that we don't even know<br>what those jobs will be but also to<br>prepare people who are currently in<br>employment to make a shift into the new<br>kinds of jobs that will exist as well<br>and that's often portrayed as being an<br>issue of training but I think it's much<br>more than that so I think this means<br>that we also need to think about how to<br>restructure education for example<br>traditionally within universities<br>knowledge is usually thought of in terms<br>of disciplines and it's quite clear that<br>in the new economy knowledge isn't going<br>to be the source of competitive<br>advantage there are a number of<br>fundamental skills that are important<br>and these cut across traditional<br>disciplines so at the School of Business<br>we've already realized that this is an<br>issue and we're beginning to change the<br>way that we teach our students so we're<br>moving away from traditional<br>lecture-based classrooms and towards<br>opportunities to provide students with<br>more real-world experience to work in<br>teams and to experience the kinds of<br>workplace environments that they are<br>likely to encounter in the future a good<br>example is our center for innovation and<br>entrepreneurship which has recently<br>opened the unleash space the unleash<br>space incorporates both a maker space<br>where students can interact with<br>technology and equipment work in teams<br>try out ideas build prototypes but also<br>a more general activity space where they<br>can engage with businesses and with<br>others on projects related to<br>to future-proof themselves I think that<br>individuals have to change the way that<br>they think they need to stop thinking<br>about jobs specific skills and rather<br>start thinking about the core<br>fundamental foundational skills that<br>help them deal with change people should<br>focus on becoming more resilient I'm<br>becoming more adaptive and by deepening<br>their understanding of a few<br>foundational skills that probably find<br>that it is much easier to pivot between<br>careers that on the surface don't have a<br>lot in common but underneath rely on a<br>few basic skills that will that they can<br>use in different ways throughout their<br>lifetime paradoxically the foundational<br>skills that are most important are those<br>that make us most human they're things<br>like emotional intelligence and our<br>understanding of culture and our ability<br>to collaborate and communicate with<br>other people<br>in essence the skills that machine's<br>can't take over and the last thing I<br>think we need to think about is we have<br>to stop thinking about education as<br>being something that's separate from our<br>work life education is not something<br>that we do until our early 20s and then<br>we transition into work rather education<br>is something that is intertwined with<br>work throughout our lifetime that helps<br>us to continue to deepen our<br>understanding of those foundational<br>skills but though that also constantly<br>gives us an overlay of new technical<br>skills that help us to move between<br>different jobs no matter what those may<br>be</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
