font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>many hundreds of University of Auckland<br>students and supporters have rallied<br>today to protest against the closure of<br>several specialist libraries the<br>universities architecture and planning<br>music and dance and Fine Arts libraries<br>are all earmarked for closure but<br>students say there haven't been<br>consulted about of what it means and<br>they fear what the closures will mean<br>for their learning and research and with<br>the sense that the university is losing<br>something as an institution our reporter<br>Sarah Robson was the lead by a band from<br>the music school hundreds of students<br>carrying banners and placards much from<br>the university's general library to the<br>office of the Vice Chancellor one of<br>them was thirdly a finance student Rose<br>Burge she says it feels like the<br>university is taking resources away from<br>students with its library closure<br>proposal gabriela jimenez rojas studies<br>planning and urban design the<br>architecture and planning library is set<br>to be demolished and she's worried about<br>how they'll access the books they need<br>but visual people and we need those<br>around us we need the ability to look at<br>something and be inspired by it because<br>it's in front of us and not have to<br>always like think of oh this might be<br>something I need in terms of my research<br>and then I have to go looking for it<br>that's it's not the way architecture<br>works it's not the way planning we're<br>x-ray driven by what's around us under<br>the proposal the specialist libraries<br>will be merged with the general library<br>but because there's not enough space<br>there some of the books we put into<br>storage that means students will have to<br>request books and it'll take 24 hours<br>for them to be delivered gabriella<br>Jimenez Rojas says some people are<br>rethinking their future study plans I<br>know I'm rethinking definitely dreaming<br>my<br>design masters and my penny masters here<br>because I don't know whether the<br>resources are gonna help me and whether<br>they're gonna give me the the scope that<br>I need or maybe I need to go somewhere<br>else to be able to get all of that so if<br>the university is trying to drive<br>students away it's doing a very good job<br>the Oakland University Students<br>Association president and a Kozak says<br>students haven't been consulted on the<br>library closure proposal we want the<br>process to be halted before it goes to a<br>panel so it's going to go to a panel<br>there's no students on that panel we've<br>been asking and we're not allowed to<br>have any students on that panel and<br>we're not allowed to have any Evan use<br>of official consultation so we want it<br>now to be halted and for students to<br>actually get a say on these faces and a<br>kuszak says they understand they can't<br>be involved in any decision-making<br>around employment issues but they should<br>be able to have a say about the spaces<br>students use Rachel Ashby who finished<br>her honours degree in finance last year<br>sister university has ignored the views<br>of its biggest stakeholders that's<br>really absolutely unacceptable for a<br>university to neglect as large a<br>stakeholder to neglect the people that<br>it predominantly exists for as its<br>researchers and its students and to<br>refuse them access into a process that<br>is fundamentally challenging their major<br>resources and Rachel Ashby sees they're<br>not giving up we're not going to be<br>quiet about this you know we care about<br>our specialist librarians there's 45<br>jobs on the line here we care about<br>these spaces there are community<br>gathering points and that's something<br>that the university fundamentally hasn't<br>understood because they haven't talked<br>with us the students wanted to present a<br>petition to the universities Vice<br>Chancellor Stewart McCutcheon but they<br>were locked out of the Clocktower<br>building and had to hand it over to the<br>head of security instead a university<br>spokeswoman said the university had no<br>response to the students calls for the<br>consultation process to be halted<br>so the abuse could be included morty<br>Horta courtier here he coursera Robson<br>aho</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
