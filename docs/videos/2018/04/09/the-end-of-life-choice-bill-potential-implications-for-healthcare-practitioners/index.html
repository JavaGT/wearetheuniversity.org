Last year David Seymour’s End-of-Life Bill was drawn from the parliamentary ballot, and passed its first reading in December.<br><br>This Bill seeks to give people with a terminal illness or a grievous and irremediable medical condition the option of requesting assisted dying. In its current form, the Bill sets a number of conditions that require the involvement of healthcare professionals.<br><br>The Bioethics Centre of the University of Otago is holding a panel discussion to discuss these conditions and their possible implications.<br><br>The panel considered what changes, if any, might be made to the Bill before its second reading.<br><br>Associate Professor Colin Gavaghan, Director of the New Zealand Law Foundation Centre for Law and Policy in Emerging Technologies https://www.otago.ac.nz/law/staff/colin_gavaghan.html<br><br>Dr Janine Winters, Senior Lecturer, and Dr Simon Walker, Lecturer, Bioethics Centre, Dunedin School of medicine, University of Otago https://www.otago.ac.nz/dsm/index.html</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening welcome to this panel<br>presentation<br>my name is Timon Walker I am a lecturer<br>at the university of otago bioethics<br>Center our topic is the potential impact<br>of a that euthanasia or assisted dying<br>might have on health care professionals<br>and also the possible ways that the law<br>might be written to address those<br>impacts I'll tell you a little bit about<br>the format and the content of our talk<br>but first let me introduce our speakers<br>just here we have dr. Janine winters<br>Janine's a senior lecturer at the<br>bioethics Center and also a specialist<br>in palliative care at medical<br>specialists in palliative care at Otago<br>Community Hospice<br>Channing moved to New Zealand in 2014<br>from Ohio having previously worked as<br>the physician director of palliative<br>medicine at nish Nationwide Children's<br>Hospital in Columbus actually she'd been<br>in New Zealand in 2005 at working at the<br>Bay of Islands as well<br>Janine's got extensive experience and<br>ended life care including pediatric<br>end-of-life care she's keen interest in<br>ethical issues related to end of life<br>care and also an interest in medical<br>education she's worked in psychiatry<br>family medicine in hospital medicine and<br>obviously palliative care and bioethics<br>so welcome Jeanine okay thanks very much<br>for bringing your contributions to the<br>talk today and here we have associate<br>professor Colin Garrigan Colin is the<br>first director of the New Zealand Law<br>Foundation Center for Law and policy on<br>emerging technologies now and their role<br>colin has lead research on the legal<br>ethical and policy issues around new<br>technologies including biotechnology<br>nanotechnology<br>information and communication<br>technologies and artificial intelligence<br>Colin also has expenses an extensive<br>experience in health law before Colin<br>came to New Zealand in 2008 he had<br>worked at Glasgow University as a<br>lecturer and medical law now both of our<br>speakers have given a number of talks on<br>euthanasia and assisted dying and<br>Sealand : was the actually an expert<br>witness at the High Court case of seals<br>versus attorney general and he's advised<br>Parliament on our draft legislation so<br>great to have you with us :<br>thanks for attending um so I'll tell you<br>about the format now so both of our<br>speakers have thought deeply about these<br>issues and together they're able to<br>comment on a wide range of practical<br>legal and ethical our factors a purpose<br>tonight is to have a discussion to open<br>a discussion about power law change<br>could affect healthcare providers and<br>how these effects could be addressed now<br>this is a discussion we want to invite<br>you into somewhere around ten past six<br>all going well now I want to stress that<br>this is a discussion we're not setting<br>up a debate Janine and Colin both care<br>deeply about the issues they also have<br>our different views on the messes we're<br>going to be discussing but they're also<br>open-minded read to hip and respectfully<br>consider a range of perspectives no my<br>view that's fundamental to ethics Center<br>they health about our society um so you<br>know it's it's possible that through<br>this kind of discussion we might find a<br>way of addressing the diverse and<br>various concerns that we have it's<br>equally possible of course that we won't<br>find an agreement to be stacked with<br>disagreement but even then it's still a<br>lot better I think if we've we've had a<br>discussion where all the views have been<br>considered and taken seriously rather<br>than simply relying on a vote okay so<br>that's their format um I'm going to talk<br>you through our current context in New<br>Zealand very briefly just gonna take two<br>or three minutes there are some copies<br>of the slides I'll be speaking to now if<br>you want to look at the details because<br>as Janine will be telling us the details<br>for this sort of thing are really what<br>so as most of you will be aware number<br>of jurisdictions an increasing number of<br>restrictions internationally have<br>changed the laws to allow some form of<br>euthanasia or assisted suicide there's<br>some examples for you in New Zealand we<br>do have of course active euthanasia and<br>assisted suicide are currently illegal<br>but we have a bill before Parliament<br>which I'll tell you about briefly and<br>that'll be actually the focus of a lot<br>of our discussion public debates<br>increased since the seals trial in 2015<br>and then we had the Health Select<br>Committee inquiry which received that<br>record number of submissions<br>it was June last year that David<br>Seymour's bill was drawn from the<br>parliamentary ballot and won an 80<br>chance I understand from the biscuit tin<br>and so here we are if you'd like to look<br>at the bill itself you can just go to<br>the Parliament website it's very easy to<br>find and it passed its first reading<br>last December the merchant was 76 to 44<br>now it's with the Justice Select<br>Committee and they do to report back<br>after a nine-month period the<br>submissions are closed here now you can<br>actually go on the website and watch the<br>vote in progress and I think that's<br>fantastic actually it's a bit like slow<br>TV that we now get from Scandinavia you<br>can watch them all go down some go live<br>some go right and then they have a chat<br>so that was a personal vote so which I<br>think is significant to in that we're<br>finding it doesn't fall between<br>traditional party lights people from the<br>Green Party have supported and opposed<br>and obviously the egg party as well so<br>cross party now I'm going to just<br>highlight for you some of the key<br>features of the bill talking first about<br>this section and read I'm going to<br>breathe through this Jane is going to<br>speak to some of the details but we<br>wanted to have it in your mind before<br>she came to talk this is our pretty much<br>quoting from the bill the motivation for<br>motivated by compassion<br>allowing people who so choose to end<br>their lives in peace and dignity is a<br>definition something just to notice<br>there is the assisted dying in the bill<br>refers to both what is typically called<br>active euthanasia or has traditionally<br>been and also assisted suicide or<br>assisted dying some so this is when<br>assisted sister's sister dying could<br>mean just a doctor prescribing a<br>medicine for a person to self administer<br>later but this bill is treating them<br>both under that one term it allows for<br>conscientious objection which journey<br>it's going to highlight and it asks a<br>lot let's say of them who at least it<br>requires quite a lot of the medical<br>practitioner which is a key focus of our<br>discussion these the criteria by which a<br>person would be eligible there needs to<br>be over 18<br>but they had to suffer from a terminal<br>illness likely to end his or her life<br>within six months and or or not end or a<br>grievous or irremediable medical<br>condition person would also need to be<br>deemed to be in an advanced state of<br>irreversible decline in capability and<br>experience unbearable suffering that<br>cannot be relieved in a manner that he<br>or she considers tolerable okay so<br>that's the criteria this is the page<br>about conscientious objection which you<br>can look at if you're interested the<br>only thing I want to say in passing here<br>is the contribution tinges objection is<br>a controversial issue as you would have<br>learned if you were able to attend the<br>grand round yesterday there's a lot<br>about the request process what's needed<br>in terms of informing the medical<br>practitioner what the medical<br>practitioner needs to say will must<br>the attending medical practitioner must<br>reach the opinion for that the person is<br>eligible and then there is a review<br>process where the is referred to another<br>there's something needs to happen if<br>somebody thinks the person's not<br>eligible and so on I'll let you look at<br>that for yourself then there's a lot<br>and here that just notice that the<br>medical practitioner will be required to<br>ensure that the pissants knows how to<br>take it and and advises - well consult<br>with him about what they wish to do and<br>win and so on the the day that it occurs<br>the the death the attending medical<br>practitioner must be present and then<br>she a definition of what it means to be<br>present there must be either in the room<br>or or nearby close proximity to the<br>person and then there's a reporting<br>requirement if the medication is not<br>used it will be the responsibility of<br>the medical practitioner to return the<br>medication okay and just finally noting<br>the the potential for prosecution or<br>liability at least if these conditions<br>aren't met properly so that's the<br>context that we have before us of course<br>all of this could change which is a<br>great reason to have a discussion that<br>it's with the Justice select committees<br>some of these factors may have been the<br>focus of the submissions that have been<br>given it could change before the second<br>reading and we could consider today what<br>kind of changes if any we think are<br>necessary so that's it for me for now<br>Janine is going to speak and highlight<br>her views on the bill for you and then<br>I'll give her about 10 12 minutes and<br>then 15 minutes<br>then over to : to give a response and<br>so I<br>Oh<br>I would also require finding those<br>eligible one of the ways I know that's<br>uncertain<br>so earlier to address cancer I would<br>require<br>I have a slide here this is um and I<br>read plea that seymour bill it states<br>that the motivation is action allows<br>people in their lives of peace and<br>dignity what I'm afraid you're going to<br>get he might get that for some people<br>a JetBlue euthanize that's what I'm<br>worried about we people want to get the<br>other thing is that we allow the<br>thanks to me okay so just to keep things<br>somewhat within time<br>Thank You Simon and for the emerging<br>technology guy you'd be amazed how often<br>a forgotten to switch these things on in<br>a lecture let me just see first of all<br>this is brilliant I've been involved in<br>probably dozens of debates in the years<br>the Eden dying in euthanasia and on the<br>whole we tend to be very adversarial we<br>tend to be about big top-level ethical<br>issues or Twana me versus beneficence<br>safety it's great to get involved misc<br>in a granular level of discussion you<br>can must be made to what kind of you<br>know people that are pushing it the good<br>faith and both sides I have no doubt at<br>all that Janine certainly is so what I<br>thought I'd do is I thought it<br>approached her proposals as I pretend<br>parliamentarian and to treat knees as if<br>these we're proposed amendments to the<br>bill in its current form and this is why<br>I would say about if I were in that<br>situation and I think about half of the<br>ones I'm going to talk about I agree<br>with her half I know but maybe - I agree<br>- I disagree in - I'm just not sure yet<br>I'm just not sure ever feel about them<br>that's all so here goes um the first one<br>I wanted to talk about was this to<br>carefully define those eligible and she<br>kind of divided this Center to different<br>sections there were procedural<br>requirements and then they were<br>substantive ones the procedural ones<br>look like this need to providers at each<br>eligibility step but mastication<br>capacity and coercion I don't have much<br>of a problem with that I don't think I<br>could certainly be persuaded that<br>capacity should be assessed in that way<br>even though this would mean treating<br>this particular kind of end-of-life<br>decision quite differently from most<br>other kinds of end-of-life decisions I<br>mean decisions to forego life-prolonging<br>treatment but typically the presumption<br>of capacity hold sway but but I could be<br>persuaded that this is an exceptional<br>case and that's probably merited and<br>assessment of coercion is the one I've<br>got a slight question mark over and it's<br>not because I think is less important or<br>less troubling it's really just picking<br>up on something but<br>advance look at a draft of Jenin slides<br>earlier which acknowledges that medical<br>providers are not experts in determining<br>pressure or coercion and I have to see<br>I'm neither really are lawyers these<br>kinds of situations have been assessed<br>very much on a case-by-case basis<br>the law is thoroughly cognizant of the<br>fact that no choice is made in a vacuum<br>though we all have influences that bear<br>in our decisions and for the most part<br>that's fine but there comes a point<br>where those influences become<br>overbearing of what looks like a choice<br>is actually something else but there's<br>no bright wine as to where that would<br>occur so I'd be interested to know what<br>kind of criteria would be applied to<br>that what kind of maybe training would<br>be applicable and what experience would<br>be relevant to making that determination<br>but on the whole on the whole and I<br>think I'm gonna give that one the green<br>light I think that's a decision but I<br>change that I could get behind subject<br>said that maybe someone fleshing out the<br>detail the second part was deserve a<br>substantive requirement she wants to<br>remove the non-terminal and mental<br>health diagnosis criteria and secondly<br>together more firmed up definition of<br>what we mean by a terminal condition now<br>this is one career she's taking steps to<br>see she's speaking for herself and not<br>for the palliative care movement I'm<br>gonna say the same with regard to the<br>volunteer euthanasia movement such as it<br>is because I could probably be persuaded<br>to get behind this one as well and I<br>knew they would not thank me and or like<br>me very much for seeing that and I think<br>it may be a reasonable way to proceed<br>because that would put us more closely<br>in lane with other similar jurisdictions<br>if there's more closely in line with<br>Oregon and Washington Vermont and to an<br>extent Canada are were they just talked<br>about and and avoid being foreseeable<br>doing a particular date attached to that<br>and I think maybe that's a reasonable<br>way for us to proceed for the moment<br>that the Dutch and Belgian legal systems<br>are quite different from ours and they<br>have actually quite different rationales<br>for what they've done with all of this<br>let's be keep us more closely in line<br>with the most similar on their systems<br>in the world and as a way to go that<br>might not be that may not be a bad idea<br>definition of terminal condition<br>I'm a lawyer I like definitions I<br>thought like fuzzy terms kind of<br>floating out there that has to be<br>defined later on by a court laws<br>supposed to serve as an action guide not<br>just a retrospective hold into account<br>and as such I would fever the firmer<br>definition there having said that I take<br>a point I take your point that it's<br>difficult to predict precisely how long<br>any individual will live at the risk of<br>sounding callous I'm not going to get<br>too hung up about that because that<br>uncertainty exists throughout<br>interactions between doctors and their<br>patients when a patient is making a<br>decision as to whether to undergo<br>surgery or chemotherapy or any other<br>invasive treatment often that will be<br>informed by a prognosis of what they<br>think is likely to happen in any event<br>and that proposes is fallible so my main<br>concern would be to make sure that that<br>fowl ability and that coroner of<br>uncertainty is made clear to the patient<br>this is our base destiny but we could be<br>wrong this is how should I feel about<br>this I'm not completely sure that's the<br>important part the absence of perfect<br>certainty the trick with almost any<br>advice or any it kind of decision so I I<br>don't think that should be a reason not<br>to do this so getting this one the green<br>light as well I think that's probably<br>more or less whether it should be<br>seventy five percent or something else<br>I'm open to open to evidence of that but<br>but I think it's a lot of acquaintances<br>can think I'd like to see um here's an<br>interesting thing that occurred to be<br>only less very afternoon pinna friends<br>in Canada tweeted a story let's just<br>book in there a couple of days ago<br>medical assisted their fellows couple<br>married almost seventy two years to die<br>together there's a couple of both in<br>their mid 90s aware both in the mid<br>nineties the women was pretty sick by<br>this point you'd have several heart<br>attacks and was certainly in in decline<br>the husband was not in great shape<br>either but was not thought to be<br>terminal what has been claimed in this<br>medical newspaper coefficient at Woburn<br>meal was that if Canada's requirement is<br>that death is foreseeable then to be<br>blunt when you're 96 years old<br>it kind of is I<br>if we're saying that there is likely<br>within the next year or the next six<br>months the time people are well into<br>that piece of their life it probably<br>always is in a sense and that's what<br>speaks suggested in the story so that's<br>maybe worth thinking about really a bit<br>extreme all pieces of extreme old age<br>and weather and longevity or projections<br>of longevity how that's going to play<br>that in those cases the other thing that<br>stuck in my mind about the story was in<br>a way there's something kind of<br>heartwarming about supposed that it was<br>pretty close to the end of their lives<br>and the thought of one of them good one<br>to thirty other it's not very not very<br>pleasant but I think what concerns<br>people about this kind of story is the<br>possibility of coercion or emotional<br>blackmail in some kind of way so I<br>gather this one was least according to<br>the news report scrutinized quite<br>closely and they were both spoken to in<br>several occasions and dependently of the<br>other and to try and minimize that that<br>risk he talks about the autonomy<br>argument excluding other groups affected<br>by the decision and she made a<br>recommendation to the effect that we<br>should require inclusion of our<br>representative friends and finally this<br>was the original site I think actually<br>the ocean said it should be a family<br>member or next end well autonomy is<br>already well recognized the medical and<br>ethics I don't think and tell many in<br>this room recognized in the codes of<br>health and disability service community<br>consumer rights their respects to<br>dignity and independence at the<br>individual the New Zealand Bill of<br>Rights Act always everyone the right to<br>refuse to undergo any medical treatment<br>and allows them to do all those things<br>independently if they want of their<br>family if you're competent adult you<br>have no requirement in any other medical<br>decision to involve your family if you<br>do not want to women don't need their<br>husbands permission they get sterilized<br>or have abortions relatives those<br>relatives don't get to see Jehovah's<br>Witnesses want to refuse what<br>transfusions certainly the doctors make<br>try to persuade them that it's a good<br>idea they speak to those people but in<br>some cases they may have very good<br>reasons not to want it you need be<br>strange from their families their<br>families maybe for all we know members<br>of a religious cult that they have a<br>left and they want no more to do that so<br>I'm a bit concerned I think<br>about that one 2010 myra page died in an<br>Auckland hospital after refusing to eat<br>for 16 days she was tetraplegic and had<br>decided she didn't want to go one so she<br>simply stopped eating her husband tried<br>very hard to persuade her to do so<br>Anthony that feel tried very hard to<br>persuade the hospital that she should be<br>fed against her will to keep her alive<br>he was not allowed to impose that<br>worship on her and that kind of schism I<br>think is something that can arise in<br>Lakes case I'm very unhappy I'm sure<br>it's traumatizing for the family but I<br>don't think I'm prepared to go as far as<br>to see that the family should always<br>have to be involved in that decision any<br>more than in any other Monday trail of<br>symptom management I know Maggie Bari<br>has a proposed amendment to the bill<br>that would require something of this<br>nature as well and I can see the appeal<br>I can see the logic that says how can<br>you make an informed decision about<br>treatment option or about the likely<br>quality of your life if you haven't even<br>given it a try it I can see the appeal<br>and that but it would be a substantial<br>step away from what we do in other kinds<br>of medical treatment there's a famous<br>case in the UK it was the judge at the<br>bedside of again a tetraplegic patient<br>who wanted life-sustaining treatment to<br>be withdrawn the consultant didn't want<br>to do it because he thought if she gave<br>like a chance in the state she would<br>come to see the value in it give it six<br>months he said if you still agree with<br>me they don't go along with it<br>the judge said she didn't have to do<br>that if you were correct Salter would<br>correct the absence of experience of<br>spinal rehabilitation but deny this<br>patient the right to choose whether or<br>not to go to one in short we'd never be<br>able to choose anything at the first<br>time and I think that's too far<br>for me of a step away from what the law<br>currently allows I'm conscious of time<br>here so I'm going to crack on and a<br>little bit I think this is good never<br>set up a situation that pressures a<br>person into a particular time to me<br>others expectations<br>Denis and I have a slight disagreement<br>about the respective dangers of giving<br>the patient the medication a way to take<br>in their own time<br>nicely concerned<br>oh you may be able to ascertain the<br>patient's capacity and the absence of<br>coercion at the time is harder to do the<br>future time for nearly to take the<br>medication and so I think there's risks<br>on both sides with this one I'm<br>open-minded a bit which is the safer<br>thing to go on the whole I think it's a<br>great idea to try and avoid that I've<br>been only add the conflict can arise<br>when communication breaks down and it<br>can happen again<br>with existing decisions only adir two<br>ago we saw the controversy that arose in<br>Waikato Hospital where communications<br>had broken down no idea whose fault for<br>that and resulted in a messy business<br>with trespass notice things I've done<br>the weight of a terminally ill mine so<br>that's led to significant anger from<br>from horny harita and others it could<br>happen would you have think to see I'll<br>skip over this when I think just ninja<br>sometime I just come to this last one<br>where janina's claimed that a doctor<br>might be compelled to refer to someone<br>else who will after taking doctor even<br>if the first doctor thinks the patient's<br>not a good candidate or is vulnerable or<br>depressed I'm not quite sure what she<br>means by this this sounds like a<br>different thing from conscientious<br>objection it sounds to me more like the<br>situation where the doctor is not sure<br>that the patient satisfies the<br>eligibility criteria if that's the case<br>I don't see anywhere in the bill a<br>requirement to refer to a second doctor<br>that said it doesn't sound to me<br>obviously a terrible idea - hello the<br>patient's second opinion if you think<br>the first Doc's has been wrong in that<br>assessment I don't see anything and<br>require it or it would criminalize a<br>failure to do so and in fact even with<br>regard to conscientious objection the<br>requirement analogously to abortion<br>provision is in fact ordinary to notify<br>the patient of the existence of of other<br>alternatives it doesn't there's anything<br>in there at the moment that mandates<br>specific referral so on the whole I<br>would say there's a couple I would<br>definitely agree subject to looking for<br>more detail a couple where I'm not yet<br>can then<br>and a couple where I'm really just not<br>sure I think there's good things of what<br>she's just seeing here I'm not quite<br>sure the basically to go about remedying<br>them just yet so I'm gonna leave it<br>there and we've some time for discussion<br>thank you very much okay I think it<br>around 13 past it might be a good<br>opportunity now to invite you guys to<br>make comments or ask questions of our<br>two panelists but Janine do you want to<br>respond to a one single Cowen's me it's<br>quite a lot to take yeah yeah I'll give<br>you another opportunity in a few minutes<br>if you like and yeah thank you<br>what do you know what else like to make<br>a comment now that yes what the effect<br>will be on the medical practitioner of<br>actually giving the medication and what<br>the experience was overseas some of the<br>things that I've read from overseas<br>there's an article recently our ACP<br>quoted it in in their documents about<br>people up doctors opting out in Canada<br>already and there was a very good<br>article that I read of a Belgian<br>oncologist who described what it was<br>like to be a bedside and I talked with<br>somebody from Canada who was describing<br>that when the GPS in Canada have gotten<br>involved with it was just passed two<br>years ago in Canada and that it was much<br>more than what they expected it was more<br>upsetting it was more taxing you know<br>it's not just another day at the office<br>you don't just you know go home to your<br>your family and and not think about it<br>so I'm quite worried and the slides I<br>didn't have time to go over is you know<br>doctors hold a lot of responsibilities<br>they have a high suicide rate it's hard<br>enough to decide to withhold<br>or withdraw treatment but to actually<br>stand at the bedside and have to inject<br>a substance and then stay until the<br>person dies I think that that's asking<br>too much and the doctors will have<br>mental health issues from that regret<br>remorse so on I'm the some doctors also<br>will use defense mechanisms to become<br>radicalized you know oh well I did that<br>so you know it must be okay and use the<br>intellectualization and then and lose<br>the how fine those lines are that we<br>need to make decisions about as doctors<br>one call I don't know how anybody can do<br>your jobs I really don't I think the<br>kind of decisions doctors have to make<br>the kind of burden of responsibility<br>they have to be is is just unlike<br>anything that most of us would ever have<br>to contend with I hope that there are<br>support provisions in existence already<br>up to including mental health support if<br>that comes to be required and I think it<br>would certainly be necessary in this<br>case - I'm not sure it is an open<br>empirical question to me whether this<br>would be different from the doctor who<br>withdraws life-sustaining treatment from<br>our terminally ill immune eat which<br>happens already I just I just don't know<br>I'd imagine perhaps that that in the<br>shorter term the fact that it's not<br>something of which they have experienced<br>and pushed it's not a tradition in<br>medicine me at me add to that so it's<br>that difficulty but I couldn't I<br>couldn't disagree at all there has to be<br>some kind of support mechanism in place<br>and if that's that's what the question<br>is but as to how it's gonna affect up<br>just down the lane I don't know this I<br>mean could be did this come from I<br>suppose would be or Oregon or something<br>maybe kind of does not mean go long<br>enough for us to Oregon my point is is<br>the assisted suicide is different yes<br>yeah<br>yeah<br>it's a person but it seems yeah I call<br>that agency that that you become an<br>agent we're talking a little bit about<br>contr lair today but that when you<br>inject your own decision-making in the<br>process that you become part of the<br>outcome I mean that that happens in some<br>of these other cases too horribly<br>ferociously contested cases about<br>treating of child guard being a recent<br>one in England we had the short one<br>brushes Northland case here as well<br>where there were allegations of racism<br>against a team that decided not to<br>continue treatment I don't know there<br>must be mechanisms to minimize the<br>chance of that happening it's highly<br>avoided<br>when you're dealing with these kinds of<br>decisions thanks for that question oh<br>okay<br>Janine I'll give you a chance to yes the<br>one I trust to respond to was about<br>autonomy and that this would be the only<br>time that that families were required<br>that families or friends were required<br>to be involved and I would say that my<br>how this decision is different from<br>other decisions is who has to live with<br>the decision the person who's dead is<br>dead<br>it's everybody else who has to live with<br>the result of that decision and that<br>that can cause an awful lot of harm with<br>the survivors and that they are parties<br>and I don't I'm willing to concede that<br>there might be different ways if whom<br>needs to be involved in how much but I<br>think that you have an important look at<br>that outside of autonomy that in<br>beneficence and non-maleficence are also<br>important ethical principles and that my<br>argument against the autonomy are is<br>that it isn't important but it's not the<br>only thing that's important thanks<br>Janine do you have a quick response to<br>that well Nicole and I said yeah that's<br>something extra okay<br>I would like to cube next Georgia along<br>they saw a point about the impact on<br>doctors and and I believe that it there<br>will be a significant impact on doctors<br>and the doctor-patient relationship<br>overall and I do worry that it's going<br>to be divisive that we will have a<br>subset of medical practitioners who are<br>prepared to be involved in this process<br>and others like me who don't want to<br>kill people and I I think it could end<br>up being quite divisive in that way and<br>it's that's a worry about the whole bill<br>and the whole process which obviously I<br>don't support if I'm right and you three<br>might be able to correct me initial fact<br>at the end the doctor is actually<br>required by law to go ahead with the<br>process that that the patient can back<br>out to the end but the doctor must must<br>deliver must deliver the medication and<br>I find that a little difficult that if<br>that if a it's a small subset of what<br>I'm saying but but if at the end the<br>doctor also can't change their mind and<br>you'd be aware of the conscientious<br>objection option you're saying once the<br>process starts the doctors committed<br>yeah I I don't know what the answer that<br>would be cold you know I'm not sure if<br>you're suggesting that having gone<br>through the whole process as required in<br>the bill and having decided the patient<br>needs ability criteria than the dog for<br>weight to the data size they don't want<br>to do it they should be sorry I really<br>don't I think you have wasted a<br>patient's time you took them so I'm very<br>grill and crosser you were perfectly<br>within your erased auto rate from the<br>beginning why I think that's getting too<br>much we to the doctor and none at all to<br>the patients<br>speculation if if you don't want to do<br>it don't do it if you don't think the<br>patient meets the criteria don't do it<br>having done all that and gone through<br>the whole process you don't get to back<br>out at the last minute and call that<br>good medical practice not not to my mind<br>I disagree I guess I could imagine<br>parallel situations so if you initiated<br>say surgery and then you put the person<br>through the the booking and the you know<br>the preparation is a chanela I want it<br>so much abortion yeah imagine it was a<br>porno you're not a conscientious<br>objector decided the patient meets all<br>of the criteria but in the last moment<br>you say you don't want to do it yeah I<br>think there would be something you're<br>professional well that's entirely that's<br>entirely alone that's that's your right<br>but but then but then what you're saying<br>you're seated you see if the patient<br>rates up front I'm not gonna do this for<br>you and that's fine you can seek another<br>doctor if they want you don't even have<br>to do that but you don't get to string<br>them along and they seen what the last<br>minute I agree in principle that that's<br>a bad thing I what I can imagine though<br>is somebody who the people who request<br>euthanasia tend to before thinking<br>articulate educated people and that<br>they've appealed to this doctors sense<br>of you know I want to be there for you I<br>want to help you and then they get you<br>know then you're standing on the edge of<br>the diving board and they're like oh my<br>god I'm about to kill somebody and I<br>could see that that not being able to<br>back out at that point in time without a<br>legal case would be quite frightening<br>then there could be good reasons why you<br>would back hurdle I think if the<br>circumstances changed he became aware of<br>something you went over it all before<br>if the prognosis had changed if you<br>suddenly start to get him serious things<br>that there was coercion involved on the<br>patient I'm getting critical maybe<br>cheating that Pete these would all be<br>great business the bucket though that's<br>not in the bill but the patient-centered<br>reasons they're not yeah the Thanks<br>after that question for another couple<br>oh there was one in the back I just<br>wanted to pick up on your point earlier<br>about the impact on the family I we can<br>charm use mortality review and the<br>leading cause of death and<br>nineteen year olds a suicide I spin a<br>fair part of my time reading true<br>stories of people who have killed<br>themselves and some of those suspected<br>triggers of that and something that<br>impacts deeply on young people is what<br>people older than them have done every<br>nuts a huge respecter to know someone in<br>the family who's has died family from<br>suicide but from other causes as well I<br>guess so it sort of comes under your<br>question about impact on others which I<br>think can be very substantial but also<br>wonder about what message we're sending<br>our young people when we say actually<br>that's all right to kill yourself in<br>these situations but don't do it when<br>you're young and you're just a bit<br>depressed<br>now what message are we giving our young<br>people about life and whether it's<br>worthwhile and their place in the world<br>in this conference thank you yes a good<br>point um it might be a reason to limit<br>it to terminal kitties<br>I know because what you're seeing there<br>is it's definitely when you're dying<br>it's definitely your unindicted is<br>definitely going to die soon<br>they knew the girl then you're just<br>unhappy a softening your life who says<br>it was all I and so that that merely a<br>reason to feel it definitely intuitively<br>it feels different to me um but like<br>many people I've had experience with<br>young people can have been taking little<br>mice I want it to me like no good reason<br>have also an experience of very sick<br>people we decided it had enough<br>unstopped stop having any more medical<br>interventions I can only speak to myself<br>and say those cases felt emotionally<br>very very definite to me and I had no<br>problem even as a young person seeing<br>you can't thanks for the question any<br>okay within me have actually come to the<br>time that was allotted for so could you<br>please join me in thanking our two<br>speakers this evening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
