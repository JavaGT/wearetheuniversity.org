font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i'm professor frank bloomfield direct to<br>the liggins institute and consultant<br>neonatologists at national hospital I<br>think that the research that I'm doing<br>and I'm involved with is trying to<br>address questions about how we can<br>improve the outcomes for some of the<br>most vulnerable people in New Zealand<br>and that's out either preterm babies or<br>babies who haven't grown well in the<br>womb or immediately after birth we know<br>that those sorts of babies grow up to<br>have lots of problems later in life and<br>yet we don't really know how we can<br>mitigate those long-term effects through<br>interventions either before birth or in<br>the newborn period and over many years<br>we're gradually developing evidence to<br>show that there are ways that we can<br>intervene to improve their lifelong<br>health I think one of the research<br>questions that I found most exciting<br>recently and I think that has engendered<br>a lot of excitement in everyone I've<br>spoken to about it whether it's other<br>researchers or whether it's nurses on<br>the new natal unit or the public is a<br>really really simple question that we<br>know nothing about and that really is<br>how important it is for preterm babies<br>to have the opportunity to smell and<br>taste their food before they get given a<br>feed down the feeding tube it's<br>something that we don't do routinely and<br>yet for the rest of us is such an<br>essential part of our nutrition and the<br>way that we feed having affects all<br>levels of our body from the brain<br>through to the gut and the pancreas and<br>yet it's something that we have<br>neglected in preterm babies and trying<br>to address how important that might be<br>and whether that can actually improve<br>the feeding outcomes and the growth<br>outcomes for these babies is something<br>that I'm investigating at the moment<br>what I think is really simple but<br>exciting question young researchers are<br>our future<br>and now the future of research in New<br>Zealand research Northland amudha<br>Milligan's Institute and for us to<br>continue to grow and produce excellent<br>research we have to have the top quality<br>young researchers coming through and<br>being trained to do that well so when<br>I'm looking for someone to join my team<br>with a post doctoral student the things<br>that I really are keen to find our<br>demonstration of initiative and the<br>ability to work independently the<br>ability to demonstrate creative thinking<br>and I think finally but certainly not<br>least the ability to think outside the<br>box<br>I think the Liggins Institute is a great<br>place to work because although it's we<br>call it a large-scale Research Institute<br>it really feels more like a family I<br>think it's the right size where everyone<br>knows everyone else people work together<br>across lots of disciplines and we<br>involve students and postdocs all levels<br>of what we do and so I think that really<br>makes it a great place to work</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
