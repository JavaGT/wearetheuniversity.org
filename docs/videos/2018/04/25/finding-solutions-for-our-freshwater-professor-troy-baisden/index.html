all<br>of you to this inaugural professorial<br>lecture for professor Troy based on Troy<br>specializes in understanding the flow of<br>nutrients water and carbon through<br>terrestrial ecosystems and resulting<br>impacts and freshwater it is a specialty<br>that has seen Troy apply big-picture<br>thinking to help solve some of the big<br>issues facing today's world including<br>acid rain climate change and most<br>recently freshwater ecosystems<br>Troy grew up in Maryland and attended<br>Dartmouth College before receiving a<br>NASA Earth System science doctoral<br>fellowship to support his research on<br>the use of isotope techniques to<br>understand the carbon cycle and soils<br>that research earned him a PhD at the<br>University of California Berkeley in<br>2000 his work at Berkeley fitted<br>perfectly into a period of rapidly<br>expanding climate change and<br>environmental research and the<br>reconfiguration of a number of small<br>disciplinary departments into a large<br>multidisciplinary and biometal program<br>at the beginning of 2001 Troy came to<br>New Zealand to undertake what was<br>initially a postdoctoral appointment at<br>menarche Fonua Landcare research he went<br>on to lead research projects related to<br>the implementation of the soil carbon<br>monitoring system required to meet New<br>Zealand's international climate change<br>commitments including the hero to<br>approach protocol he employed the<br>interdisciplinary skills he learned in<br>Berkeley to lead the human dimensions<br>components of New Zealand's largest<br>greenhouse gas research program<br>including synthesizing the science<br>needed to support economic assessments<br>of the development of<br>trading schemes on land use in 2006<br>Troy moved to gns sciences national<br>isotope Center where he used isotopes<br>and natural and agricultural systems as<br>a means to work across a range of<br>environmental research areas arriving at<br>his current focus on the<br>interrelationships between water<br>nutrients carbon and productivity across<br>New Zealand's ecosystems<br>Troy has an outstanding publication<br>record and has been associate editor of<br>the journal biogeochemistry for over a<br>decade<br>November last year<br>Troy arrived at the University of<br>Waikato as professor and as the second<br>Bay of Plenty Regional Council Chair in<br>Lake and freshwater science ladies and<br>gentlemen please welcome professor Troy<br>Basden to give his inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>Kyoto Kyoto Kyoto Kyoto Kyoto Kyoto<br>Katella thank you all for joining me<br>here today at a university that I've<br>always liked working with to talk about<br>looking after our freshwater I think a<br>lot of talks that you might hear on this<br>theme of inaugural lectures could<br>perhaps be somewhat esoteric and have to<br>work hard to convince you of the value<br>of the topic but I think there's no need<br>to convince New Zealanders of the value<br>of freshwater it constantly rates at the<br>top of Lincoln University's public<br>perception survey as the environmental<br>issue Kiwis care most about the<br>University's title slides include the<br>lakes here as a centerpiece of campuses<br>very much about who we are as a<br>university so we all agree on the topic<br>and the challenge is to move forward<br>with solutions I've hit a relatively<br>unique path to get here and that may<br>help us take a journey together towards<br>the solutions<br>so what I'll begin with is a little bit<br>of sort of an academic style mihi that<br>I've tried out as I've talked to people<br>about my new position and I think people<br>have liked it and it's helped them<br>understand who I am and the the journey<br>I've taken as a mix of who I am<br>personally and who I am as an academic<br>coach errick ete we I'm only a tiny bit<br>Cherokee mostly French settlers that<br>came over with Lafayette and of course<br>English but my father's family was from<br>the the northwestern corner of Kentucky<br>in the West Virginia border which is<br>where part of the Cherokee Nation lived<br>before the English and the French came<br>to North America the story of the<br>Cherokee is sad there was a trail of<br>tears when they were marked out of<br>marched out of their conventional<br>homeland into Oklahoma a land that they<br>had no connection to and so for me this<br>is a point of connection to some degree<br>but it's also appointed death<br>dispossession because being 1/16 or 1/32<br>Cherokee doesn't count as<br>being Native American in America in the<br>same way that it might you know still<br>count in a way that you could identify<br>as being Maori here moreover it does<br>help me understand though the sense of<br>dispossession as well as the value of<br>working with people who can take monofin<br>wa and chi Chiaki Tonga seriously and<br>see that as the role<br>coach Chesapeake Keawe this is the<br>Chesapeake Bay or a tributary of it<br>where my mother owned a farm where my<br>family was connected to agriculture<br>directly on a major water body the<br>world's largest estuary it's an area you<br>can see a beautiful sunset here but if<br>you read into a beautiful sunset you'll<br>know that a beautiful sunset often means<br>pollution and stuff in the air the<br>Chesapeake Bay is a troubled water body<br>it's a body that has too much farming in<br>the larger catchment and then it has too<br>much population in the larger catchment<br>and if that wasn't enough having more<br>than doubled the nutrient capacity of<br>what it can really take it also has<br>twice as much again nitrogen coming in<br>from the Midwest or new US and blowing<br>across from industry so I took with me<br>an interest in environmental issues to<br>Dartmouth to Dartmouth College and this<br>is Dartmouth Mountain<br>Teemu silica Moussa walk and this is my<br>family on top of Musa Locke Musa Locke<br>is a mountain at the heart of the<br>country where Hubbard Brook is and<br>Humber Brook is one of the world's most<br>important ecosystem watershed<br>experiments it's the place where the<br>term acid rain was actually coined in<br>studying this and if you in this picture<br>of the Hubbard Brook ecosystem is<br>essentially just to the left side of the<br>picture looking off into the distance<br>there by the time I had arrived I was<br>somewhat dispossessed of that acid rain<br>research was sort of in its dying days<br>and it mostly passed into cloud<br>chemistry research on Moussa Loch itself<br>which was interesting because it turns<br>out the high elevation ecosystems which<br>I loved received cloud inputs and those<br>are concentrated in acid by a factor of<br>10 compared to compared to the<br>in itself and so the high elevation<br>rivers lakes and forests all took a<br>beating and that was worth studying<br>I did my honours thesis on that topic<br>and moved on to Berkeley where I worked<br>in this building which interestingly<br>enough says at the top of it to rescue<br>for Humanity for human society rather<br>the native values of rural life and<br>indeed this was the heart of the<br>ecosystem sciences division in the<br>department of environmental science<br>policy and management when I arrived in<br>Berkeley we had a major transformation<br>of getting rid of the small disciplinary<br>departments like soil science which I<br>came into and building a large<br>interdisciplinary science program the<br>people I was there with who also became<br>ecosystem scientists our people I travel<br>the world with and continue to see it<br>conferences and come and visit me and so<br>in a sense it feels very much like they<br>are my people they're part of my waka<br>SoCo ecosystem science day waka is an<br>idea that feels roughly right to my<br>heart now why this matters is<br>interesting in the sense that in New<br>Zealand at the same time the science<br>complex was going through a major<br>transformation forming the crown<br>research institutes that I've worked in<br>for the last 15 years but that was 10<br>years almost before I arrived and<br>Berkeley they were forming a new way of<br>doing science and it turned out to be<br>the right way for what is called<br>post-normal science so what is<br>post-normal science it's science<br>simply where the decision stakes and the<br>uncertainties that we have to deal with<br>are enormous issues like water and<br>climate change where we deal with the<br>scale where we're talking about changing<br>the economics and the environment at the<br>scale of the whole catchment a whole<br>nation or a whole planet so it is indeed<br>high stakes high uncertainty it's also a<br>situation where typically decisions get<br>made with urgency and sometimes as we've<br>seen with climate change work out to be<br>highly unsatisfactory<br>one thing I'd like to say from the<br>outset is that I see universities as an<br>important model for making progress on<br>issues like this what they provide is<br>essentially trust in transparency as<br>well as the connections across different<br>areas where we need to understand things<br>the crown research institutes<br>interestingly were set up very much on a<br>conventional science model what would be<br>called as normal science where there's a<br>benefit because of new zealand's small<br>size between applied science or normal<br>science and consultancy going across the<br>boundary where the size of institutions<br>means that combining both of those into<br>a single institutions make them more<br>pepper more profitable give them a<br>greater scale so this work was done in<br>1992-1993 and one of the key things I<br>would say is simply that what we can do<br>in post normal science often focuses on<br>reducing uncertainties in some ways<br>that's the best we can do in other ways<br>the most important thing we can do is<br>recognizing the scope of the problem and<br>that the discourse and our ability to<br>talk to each other is really the heart<br>of success so let's talk about how I<br>think about connecting freshwater<br>catchments ecosystems and seeing it as<br>an area of science I have two favorite<br>quotes which served most usefully in<br>juxtaposition to one another<br>Otto Leopold was a famous American<br>conservationist who said the first role<br>of intelligent tinkering is to keep all<br>the pieces we can compare that with the<br>the children's book the Prince written<br>by Antoine de saint-exupéry who said<br>perfection and anything at all is<br>achieved not when there is no longer<br>anything to add but when there's nothing<br>left to take away you can get a sense of<br>the juxtaposition of those statements<br>and I think this summarizes part of what<br>we do in the sense we're at our most<br>believable when we demonstrate that we<br>have a lot of knowledge but not that we<br>have to use it all we keep the<br>workings of what we're teaching or<br>focusing on simple I'll take you through<br>some very briefly some of the examples<br>of what I do with isotopes just to prove<br>that those examples exists perhaps but<br>also that they can be simplified and in<br>fact I spent 10 years after my<br>dissertation simplifying this example<br>the goal is to constrain soil organic<br>matter dynamics we have carbon that<br>moves through systems and we know now to<br>care a great deal about carbon but years<br>before we cared about carbon we carried<br>cared greatly about nitrogen in<br>ecosystems because that's the main<br>nutrient that limits plant growth that<br>limits pasture growth in New Zealand for<br>example so carbon shown by the blue area<br>it's arrows here comes in from the<br>atmosphere goes back out to the<br>atmosphere and we can measure the way<br>that it does that with radiocarbon in a<br>way that I'll show you in a moment and<br>that in turn tells us how quickly<br>nitrogen moves through the same system<br>now this is a very tricky system to<br>actually work on as a scientist because<br>most of what happens here happens on<br>decades not on three-year time spans<br>when you can get a grant and solve<br>something but if it happens over 10 or<br>20 years how do we study that the answer<br>is isotopes and that allows us to<br>compare different soils in different<br>places today I'll focus on two soils<br>Egmont and Tokomaru on either side of<br>the Manawatu one has very volcanic<br>current material derived from the from<br>the Terra naki volcano the other is<br>derived from the grey whackies and<br>sediment that's washed down the Manawatu<br>River the latter one is that Tokomaru so<br>the end of solar volcanic soil here<br>looks very different if we look at the<br>red line versus the black line by<br>comparison the atmosphere is shown in<br>blue and this is what radiocarbon really<br>does for us it turns out thermonuclear<br>weapons testing left us a tracer in the<br>atmosphere that adds to what the<br>radioactive clock that we use for<br>radiocarbon dating can tell us and<br>essentially what's happened here is the<br>radiocarbon was measured by a New<br>Zealander named Otto rafter who founded<br>the lab that hour<br>at that last 11 years before I arrived<br>here and he measured this a number of<br>times and actually calculated turnover<br>rates for slowly Ganic matter that we're<br>very close to the numbers that I got and<br>what we see is that the toka Morrisville<br>turns over quite a bit slower than the<br>volcanic soil the Egmont soil and that<br>tells us that the rate of nitrogen<br>supply and one is slower than the other<br>compared to the amount of organic matter<br>involved but it turns out the system<br>adjusts for that and the amount of<br>organic matter that's stored in the<br>volcanic soils is much greater and so<br>both in the end grow the same amount of<br>grass I'm going to move on now to Lake<br>taupe all the example of regional plan<br>variation 5 it's one of our great<br>examples of Environmental Management in<br>New Zealand and in fact it's a<br>world-leading example because it is the<br>world's first cap and trade scheme where<br>a cap has been put on nitrogen in the<br>environment and in fact it's been<br>brought down by 20% so that farmers and<br>foresters have to stay within the<br>catchment particularly farmers<br>underneath that cap that's been reduced<br>by 20% over what they started with<br>like topo of course is an iconic place<br>for New Zealanders it has some of the<br>cleanest fresh water of any lake on the<br>southern hemisphere I believe on you can<br>typically see down roughly 15 metres the<br>objectives of the plan were pretty<br>simple they were very long-term they<br>were to restore by 2080 the water<br>quality as it existed in 2001 and they<br>looked at a simple set of indicators to<br>nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus and<br>the other stuff we find in the lake the<br>depth that you can see down to and the<br>amount of chlorophyll or algae that's<br>growing in the lake turns out that in<br>this case nitrogen was what needed to be<br>focused on and so the entire case<br>focused on nitrogen and my role was<br>essentially to come in and look at a<br>couple aspects of this table this table<br>now that I put up the red focuses on the<br>aspects of nitrogen in the lake which<br>are manageable so really there's a whole<br>bunch of numbers there but the key ones<br>are the non-dairy pastures and the<br>opportunity to convert those to pine<br>where I've just put up the red arrows<br>and the key thing there is that turns<br>out that the pine has no nitrogen going<br>into it and leeches in the end less<br>nitrogen than farming but in the<br>medium-term and in some cases in the<br>short-term there was great concern the<br>pine could actually leach quite a bit<br>more during the conversion process so<br>where I got cold in was actually to try<br>to make sense and create adjustments in<br>the whole process so this was a court<br>case that essentially this Regional<br>Council started planning in 2001 the<br>legislation was around roughly by 2006<br>and it was an Environment Court in all<br>through 2008 and this is some of the<br>stuff that came up in Environment Court<br>is a particular model that was chosen<br>the right model to use was the leaching<br>from forests what everybody said it was<br>how could we decide that was the part I<br>became particularly volved in but I<br>think what I really learned from this<br>was that there was a real opportunity<br>here to get people focused on scientific<br>principles that were in the<br>international literature and the key<br>point there was the long-term<br>equilibrium matters in the long term if<br>you're thinking out to time spans that<br>are roughly said at 2080<br>what mattered was the inputs of nitrogen<br>and there's no inputs going into a pine<br>forest whereas there are inputs going<br>into a pasture that has animals on it<br>through clover this is how it looked in<br>the end that I could find that what I<br>did actually made a difference it showed<br>up in the interim court decision from<br>the Environment Court and interestingly<br>at the time these documents were<br>basically distributed on the internet<br>and a fax quality you can read it it<br>basically says that I emphasize<br>that the land-use change might take a<br>long time to have its effect but it<br>would halt the inputs of nitrogen in the<br>end and that did have a big impact on<br>simplifying the final legislation and<br>that's interesting in the sense that<br>bringing the judge and the commissioners<br>in a very interesting environment court<br>process to a principal actually mattered<br>to simplify what everybody is going to<br>have to deal with in that catchment this<br>brings me to the heart of some of the<br>things I would really want to talk about<br>which is the value of<br>transdisciplinarity that having<br>realistic understanding of the flow from<br>soil to freshwater is what's brought me<br>to this University<br>and what's interesting about my<br>appointment that as a soil scientist<br>I've now become a professor of lake in<br>freshwater research but it's very much<br>what we should be doing because managing<br>lakes involves managing catchments this<br>is a diagram essentially what that looks<br>like that I'll come back to in a minute<br>but the main thing I want to emphasize<br>here is that if we see disciplines as a<br>filter we often have a lot of<br>disciplines we have disciplines within<br>universities we have disciplinary<br>societies that dominate the New Zealand<br>conference season agriculture and<br>horticultural society grassland society<br>soil science society and then freshwater<br>society in a competing hydrological<br>society how do we make sense of all<br>these things well I believe the key to<br>transdisciplinarity and this is what I<br>really want to focus on today is to<br>identify principles rules and models are<br>level above principles and we often fail<br>when we look at rules and we fail to<br>identify the exceptions that we should<br>have recognized if we looked at the<br>principles of what we were doing each<br>discipline is a way that we've been<br>through life and it teaches us how to<br>think but it teaches us how to think<br>down certain tunnels of thinking and so<br>we start to think across disciplines and<br>communicate about what the principles<br>are that help us communicate across each<br>discipline we actually can do some<br>consider<br>learning and improve our communication<br>we confine and spot both barriers before<br>we run into them and our blind spots I<br>think it greatly matters that we explain<br>important problems like this to the<br>world partly because it helps us work<br>across the university and that's part of<br>the reason why I came here the<br>opportunity to work across faculties of<br>law management economics Social Sciences<br>so on and so forth even the arts and the<br>communication aspects of of that matter<br>but it also means that we can<br>communicate with the rest of society and<br>ultimately if we don't explain things in<br>a way that makes sense to our children<br>we leave them the problems that we have<br>in today's world to inherit as a<br>consequence of that we have to make<br>these problems understandable in a way<br>so that society can look at them so<br>let's take a particular example in New<br>Zealand where we can draw some insight a<br>block north drinking water crisis<br>imagine that you got up in the morning<br>and suddenly started feeling unwell and<br>then your whole family felt unwell and<br>everybody on your street felt unwell in<br>total five thousand people in a town of<br>14,000 were seriously ill I was trying<br>ultimately the --have lakh North inquiry<br>and its second phase came to the point<br>of view that New Zealand had failed to<br>recognize the principles of drinking<br>water security the internationally<br>accepted principles of drinking water<br>security there are six of them and so<br>this is what I mean when I say that we<br> focus on results and the science<br>that we do we can focus on the models or<br>the rules if this then that situations<br>that we might follow or we can focus on<br>the principles that matter and I think<br>Haylock North teaches of something that<br>on an issue very parallel to fresh water<br>we can find some solutions that we can<br>use I'll go through these in sequence so<br>inhave lakh north of<br>first principle of drinking water safety<br>was to simply have a high standard of<br>care that's fairly obvious and in fresh<br>water we might say that we should have a<br>duty of care that mirrors the scale of<br>impacts so if we have a very beautiful<br>or high-value lake<br>here's Lake Tarawera for example we<br>might take extra care of that same with<br>Lake Topol in the case of Lake Rotorua<br>there was a lake that was on the verge<br>of a tipping point of going into harmful<br>algal blooms that were both unpleasant<br>and prevented swimming prevented water<br>use in general and the previous occupant<br>of my chair and the whole community<br>Regional Council City Council the the<br>District Council they all work together<br>to reverse this we still have a lot of<br>work to do to reverse that number to<br>protecting source water is paramount<br>that also makes a lot of sense for<br>drinking water security there's nothing<br>more important than the water that you<br>get as a starting point for its safety<br>in terms of fresh water and nutrients so<br>getting nutrients into our fresh water<br>as something that causes impacts it<br>should be fairly obvious that we're<br>interested in forensic allele inking and<br>explaining to farmers how the nutrients<br>that came from there caused impacts over<br>here ideally we work backward from where<br>the impacts occurred to the source of<br>the nutrients and in principle we have<br>the tools to do that<br>but do we use them perhaps not as much<br>as we should<br>I'd like to take you through a second<br>example from my science of one of the<br>tools that I developed but first I'd<br>like to emphasize the problem in cartoon<br>form the principle of where nitrogen<br>comes from that impacts most water in<br>New Zealand is the concentration that<br>comes out the back end of a cow and<br>urine it's a fairly obvious example in a<br>lot of New Zealand and where I started<br>applying this technique where we now<br>have two I taxes that are isotopes<br>nitrogen isotopes<br>on the bottom and oxygen isotopes on the<br>side don't worry too much about what<br>they mean but what I want to emphasize<br>here is that we started out doing this<br>and we found that a lot of ecosystems<br>across New Zealand retain those urine<br>spots and modify the signal that they<br>and it accumulates in soil the soil is<br>essentially providing the ecosystem<br>service of retaining the nitrogen in the<br>pasture that's what we wanted to do<br>that's how we want to think of ourselves<br>as a nation of productive farmland then<br>I moved to Southland and started doing<br>the same research the area in the very<br>middle of this plot is the area of<br>normal nitrogen retention and what we<br>see on the lower left of this plot and<br>the upper right of this plot is that in<br>Southland in particular soils where<br>different soil types are shown in<br>different colors the ones in blue acted<br>like the soils in the rest of the<br>country but Southland has enormous<br>nitrogen problems and those nitrogen<br>problems tagged to themselves on my plot<br>forensically as looking just like animal<br>urine or looking just like effluent that<br>was applied to paddocks and came through<br>straight through soils that are<br>essentially gravels and they came<br>straight through into water so there's a<br>lot we can do there another nice little<br>example of things that we can do based<br>on principles is maximize this is<br>sequential removal of nutrient<br>contaminants sequential removal is<br>pretty easy in the sense that here's an<br>example of an agricultural landscape in<br>the wild or a PHA there's no nothing<br>here between the paddock and the streams<br>to remove nutrients if we try to get<br>ninety percent out we'd have to come up<br>with something quite complex but if we<br>focus on riparian zones if we focus on<br>wetlands and we focus on farm management<br>3 50 percent solutions will get us to a<br>90 percent solution to 70 percent<br>solutions will get us to a 90 percent<br>solution the next thing I'd like to<br>focus on is examples of hot spots and<br>hot moments number four<br>by comparison this is the biggest issue<br>in Haylock north that change precedes<br>contamination examples of my research<br>that highlight this the red areas show<br>that that 9 percent of New Zealand can<br>contribute sixty four five percent of<br>the carbon that exits New Zealand rivers<br>and in fact 1.7 percent of New Zealand<br>in areas that look like this yield<br>twenty percent of that carbon that's<br>something that can actually be<br>controlled in agricultural landscapes<br>and this is something that's being done<br>by people in Rotorua where they're<br>building buns across the landscape at<br>times when water is moving now this<br>isn't as intense a hot spot hot moment<br>as those eroded ones but it's very much<br>what needs to be done to keep<br>phosphorous on the farm and not in the<br>water a last point that I very much like<br>to emphasize is that we need clear<br>ownership of impacts this is a point<br>that came up in the election or we<br>started talking about taxes before we<br>started talking about who owns water<br>it's obviously an issue that we have to<br>deal with one of the other reasons that<br>we need to deal with it is the topo and<br>Rotorua our places where ownership of<br>pollution has been dealt with seventy to<br>eighty million dollars has been<br>allocated to help pay for the shifts in<br>ownership that are acquired this is what<br>it looks like in Rotorua it's<br>complicated but it's not that<br>complicated and what you can see over<br>here on the right is a partitioning of<br>it as you move through each of the<br>arrows and a partitioning between what<br>goes to sheep and beef and what goes to<br>the dairy sector for example and what<br>goes to other schemes<br>that's the partitioning of ownership<br>that we need but as I say it's not<br>beautiful it is something that we need<br>to worry about in the rest of New<br>Zealand on the upside New Zealand has<br>catchment based management we have<br>regional councils and in fact a Regional<br>Council funds my position to work on<br>this type of science so this enables us<br>to work across to all these areas to<br>focus on multiple principles at once<br>and I'd like to close by just taking you<br>through some slides some pictures that<br>help us understand how to think about<br>water and how to understand the values<br>that we all hold in water can vary<br>depending on what we see this is Lake<br>Tarawera at its outlet if we look on<br>this view what we see is the water it<br>focuses into the freshwater system<br>itself if we take a wider view we might<br>see a taro area catchment and think<br>about land around the water if we take<br>an even wider view we might think about<br>interconnected lakes that have mainly<br>agricultural catchments that also yield<br>water to that lake if we think about<br>estuaries and Recreation we think about<br>different water users if we think about<br>agriculture putting up against the sides<br>of Lake water appala we can come to a<br>different point of view but the<br>perspective I'd like to leave you with<br>is who how we as a university can help<br>in the Rotorua lakes think about the<br>next projects as well as the existing<br>ones this is Nikki Douglas environment<br>manager for the Rotorua Lakes Trust<br>essentially the owners of the of the<br>lake bed he or she has a diagram which<br>shows her image of where we can go with<br>with managing our freshwater where each<br>hop food that has a river that rains<br>into the lake is considering what they<br>want to achieve and at the very top of<br>that diagram that says II we led we can<br>participate in code governance we can<br>participate in a we led environmental<br>governance this is our time if we focus<br>on the principles we may work towards<br>consensus we may work towards achieving<br>what we really want to see around our<br>freshwater I look forward to working<br>with you all on that and if you're<br>interested in the principles that I've<br>covered tonight I'll have the article<br>coming out in the conversation online<br>either tonight or tomorrow morning that<br>hopefully the University will be able to<br>promulgate the link for thank you very<br>much<br>Thank You Joey that was a wonderful and<br>challenging lecture my name's Chad<br>Hewitt I'm the Dean of science and I'm<br>privileged to manage Troy or at least<br>attempt to manage Troy as I'm learning<br>choice personal history has been<br>intertwined with some of the great<br>issues that challenge society the<br>environmental science the focus on water<br>quality<br>acid rain climate change they're all<br>issues that are quite wicked they don't<br>have a single solution there are many<br>different options and they certainly<br>require that that interdisciplinary<br>approach and I think Troy has<br>demonstrated that approach is really the<br>area that we need to move into some of<br>these fundamental challenges require the<br>ability for researchers and regulators<br>to work together across disciplines to<br>find those acceptable solutions<br>universities are a unique place where<br>researchers can best address those high<br>stakes high uncertainty environmental<br>issues and I think by building that<br>societal trust that Troy spoke of and<br>the sense of transparency around how<br>science inputs into those systems we can<br>identify those shared values and we can<br>more importantly identify shared<br>solutions the reference to drinking<br>water contamination Havelock North<br>looking for principles that can be<br>extended further into freshwater<br>management is a salient example of how<br>that occurs<br>truly I look forward to the<br>contributions you'll make it as the Bay<br>of Plenty Regional Council chair thank<br>you for a truly professor oriole address<br>please join me in thanking Troy once<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
