Tim's and this is Peter and<br>what we're talking about tonight is Nick<br>lurking and and hopefully by the end of<br>the evening you'll be feeling a little<br>bit more comfortable about moving your<br>comfort zone a little bit more to work<br>towards where that magic happens you'll<br>be feeling a little bit more comfortable<br>about the whole networking process now<br>of course I was a bit mean and that even<br>before you got in here we gave you a<br>task at a little networking task and I'd<br>like to just give you an indication of<br>hands through the the little task I gave<br>you as far as having it there extra<br>question there did anyone find a<br>connection or hear about a resource or<br>find out any information a couple of<br>nods excellent things that was the point<br>of it and that's also actually that<br>highlights that whole value of<br>networking I guess without further ado<br>I'll move on to the topics that we're<br>covering tonight so we're going to be<br>talking about networking and why do it a<br>bit a bit about your network and how to<br>establish who is it that is in it and<br>who to how to developers about how to<br>make a good impression and also some<br>networking tips and some strategies<br>please do ask questions as we go along<br>we're both quite quite happy to don't<br>drop what we're talking about and answer<br>those questions so don't you don't have<br>to save them all to the end so what is<br>networking would anyone like to shout<br>out what they think networking is you<br>so that's an interesting and very very<br>to them slightly freaky way I'm defining<br>networking any other sort of thoughts on<br>absolutely<br>I couldn't have actually put it any<br>better myself so if I had in the bottle<br>of wine I don't Ward you wanna note of<br>those as well<br>I've got a pre-baked one it's<br>interacting with others to actually<br>exchange information and develop those<br>professional social contacts but as you<br>say it's all about mutual benefit it's a<br>purposeful activity so it's it's it's<br>something that you actually do overtly<br>it can happen of a wide variety of<br>settings so it can be very very informal<br>or it can be very formal it's also that<br>the whole point of networking is<br>building those mutually beneficial<br>relationships and developing those<br>mutually beneficial relationships so<br>it's um it really is incredibly<br>important in fact I read somewhere that<br>it's a new critical competency for the<br>changing world that networking is going<br>to be more and more important with the<br>whole sort of advent of AI and those<br>sorts of things<br>networking is something that you're<br>actually going to be able to to utilize<br>to develop yourself and develop your<br>context and and succeed so why network<br>or yet promoting your being brand and<br>actually building on your reputation<br>helping you to access information that<br>allows you to generate better ideas and<br>also lets you communicate those better<br>ideas to others it helps you widen your<br>whole circle of influence but also it<br>allows others to influence you and you<br>can spark off their being influenced and<br>it also enables you to demonstrate how<br>you can be of value and that could be a<br>value to that person or to their<br>organisation<br>it could be a value to the community so<br>it's so networking sort of works on a<br>variety of different levels there's also<br>research that that shows that those who<br>network are more likely to get promoted<br>are more likely to hit higher salaries<br>and also have better job satisfaction so<br>it's so it wins on every level that the<br>whole network increases I'm a bit of a<br>Chia bunny for networking I have got<br>every job that I've ever got I have got<br>through networking yeah I've had to put<br>in applications but I've always there's<br>always been a networking component so if<br>I seem a little bit of an event of<br>engine astiz because I am one thing<br>that's really important in the whole<br>networking process to is to remember<br>that you're not just networking with the<br>person that you're talking to but the<br>person that they talk to in fact every<br>single person that they know so it's<br>really important and now I'm going to<br>hand over to Peter who's going to talk<br>about preparation and those sorts of<br>activities so before I'd sort of talk<br>about the preparation we actually met<br>work and we don't realize we're<br>networking so some of us have this<br>connotation that networking is using<br>people so using context to get something<br>from them but we just need to think<br>about networking as you said before it's<br>mutually beneficial and we can do it<br>when we don't realize we're doing it so<br>if you wanted to go to a dentist most of<br>us don't just randomly choose a stranger<br>to work on our teeth pain both<br>financially and physically you ask for a<br>recommendation and that's networking<br>that's using your context but it's not<br>in an active way and what I'm just going<br>to talk about is actually actively<br>networking so with actively networking<br>you need to actually think about your<br>personal style and what type of<br>networking suits you personally and then<br>you can also identify what you want to<br>achieve so in that case that was sort of<br>like identifying a dentist but you think<br>about what you want to achieve and you<br>might even have a systematic plan<br>think about sort of whether it's<br>actually return on investment even so if<br>you're trying to decide whether to<br>attend a particular event like one of<br>our careers events thinking about the<br>return on investment and then<br>researching as well and then also being<br>organized some people even love doing<br>Excel spreadsheets and working out<br>systematically and I'm sure there's some<br>mathematical equation that some people<br>might use but active networking which<br>most of us don't do but planning is a<br>good idea but his nullity in knowing<br>what your personality is is really<br>important so the cartoon I could be home<br>on the internet right now there's a few<br>of us who will be thinking that way the<br>introvert in their own is giving this<br>that's me so are you an extrovert<br>introvert are you socially awkward are<br>you shy are you outgoing knowing that<br>about yourself will really help you when<br>it comes to sort of thinking about what<br>sort of events work best for you<br>a larger events are really good for you<br>or would you be better with a smaller<br>more intimate event would you be better<br>off one-to-one would you better off if<br>you like to play golf or tennis is there<br>a better way for you to network a lot of<br>networking is done in the bar of cafe<br>time of day as well think about your<br>energy levels for some of us the thought<br>of going to a networking evening event<br>is not such a pleasant thought so maybe<br>you'd be better off meeting someone for<br>coffee or for breakfast or having<br>morning events or lunch time and sort of<br>networking so think about when your<br>energy levels are at their best and it<br>can vary so you might just have had a<br>really bad day perhaps it's better not<br>to go to that event than to go when<br>you're feeling exhausted you won't<br>promote your brand very well then<br>there's does the event fit into your<br>schedule so once again it's that evening<br>you might have commitments in the<br>morning you might have commitments at<br>night so you might have to sort of think<br>about that time of<br>in that respect as well and then what<br>platform best suits you<br>so that person who could be at home on<br>the internet maybe their best platform<br>is online rather than in person so in<br>person online so think about the<br>platform that best for you and it's<br>usually a mix so you thought about your<br>personal style and what suits you best<br>so then you can also think about your<br>purpose purpose is particularly useful<br>when it comes to the online side of<br>things so this is all sounding very<br>strategic at the moment but your purpose<br>helps you identify where and how your<br>network it also helps you work out if<br>something is worth the investment<br>but these are some ideas here about what<br>your purpose might be so it could be a<br>new job but could be getting the contact<br>it could be information so think about<br>the purpose of your networking and also<br>just remember though that it is about<br>relationships so networking mutually<br>beneficial relationships so I am talking<br>a lot about strategy and analyzing so it<br>makes it seem cold and impersonal but<br>just remember that relationships part<br>and the dentist so then it's actually<br>categorizing your context thinking about<br>who you know<br>so we heaven in the circle in the most<br>circle so that's our friend friends and<br>our family and then we've got an inner<br>circle which is the people that we work<br>with there's also an outer circles that<br>might be friends or friends or people<br>that we've sort of meant occasionally<br>very briefly and then we have sort of<br>like prospects so people we've heard of<br>that we would really like to meet for<br>whatever reason then you've got the<br>level of connectedness so there are<br>people who are called super conductors<br>or super connectors so they seem to know<br>everyone and I'm sure we all Celia's<br>smiling I'm sure we all know people who<br>are super connectors and it's how on<br>earth do you know all these people think<br>about sort of you know do they help a<br>lot of people as well so how<br>did are they do they help people are<br>they super connectors and then when you<br>go back to what I was saying before and<br>you think about your purpose different<br>people will be helpful in different<br>areas so it's about relevance so you<br>think about your purpose okay so how<br>relevant is that particular purpose<br>person for this purpose so I always<br>think about relevance<br>different people different purpose sorry<br>about all the words it's all we couldn't<br>figure out how to make that shorter and<br>you will be getting these slides by the<br>way so you've got your inner circle<br>so that's friends family colleagues it's<br>actually really easy to start with them<br>and I would suggest you do that so start<br>with sort of like the easy first<br>happened you're sort of like networks<br>your inner circle networks it might be<br>that they can introduce you to someone<br>they can introduce you to that sort of<br>like outer circle and to the prospects<br>especially if the other super connectors<br>so we've got that easy way of doing it<br>Tenzin's now going to talk more about<br>the hard way how do a question for you<br>do you think that more opportunities<br>come from those close to you or more<br>removed from you so a show of hands who<br>thinks that more opportunities will come<br>from those who are close to us so flee<br>their home or removed I think they know<br>it was a trick question<br>indeed<br>and yes the the the majority mu act<br>right there that those who have weak<br>ties those who are more removed from you<br>are actually likely to be more useful<br>for you and this this this and part of<br>the reason for that is that the strong<br>ties that you have would to say a<br>partner or or what the family member<br>often you're going to know the same<br>people and so that's why what those weak<br>ties can be much more effective now<br>we're sort of thinking about that<br>mapping your network with both your<br>stronger ties and also in your weaker<br>ties is really useful so so it's it just<br>before start actually with those<br>immediate contacts start with those who<br>are who are closest to you you could um<br>you could use your phone contactless<br>just as sort of getting out your cell<br>phone and running through that that's<br>probably the majority of those on of<br>those strong ties are going to be in<br>there there'll be some weak ties as well<br>but a lot of strong ties will be in<br>there then think think think further on<br>from this think of those who are still<br>related to but not really close to you<br>so it could be church groups it could be<br>sporting groups it could be professional<br>associations it could be extracurricular<br>activities that you go to the the<br>reading group<br>so that's but those some of those might<br>be strong ties as well I've come what<br>I've heard about reading groups in each<br>each contact from those those that's<br>sort of immediate Network and then the<br>further network can then lead to further<br>contacts now I don't know if you're into<br>mind mapping one way to actually map<br>your networks is to use something like a<br>mind map where at the core of the mind<br>map you have what you're wanting and<br>then you spring out from that but for<br>some people mind maps just doesn't<br>really work for them so you might then<br>you might look and you might find an app<br>that works for you that it actually<br>helps you to knit these things<br>or Peter mentioned spreadsheet some of<br>us love spreadsheets and that can be a<br>really good way of mapping the things<br>things out I had a boss who had a file<br>of business cards and so he would when<br>he was sort of working out his networks<br>he'd get his wad of related business<br>cards and he'd spread them all over his<br>desk it was um it was it was fascinating<br>I would never have known who all these<br>people were that he met because he<br>couldn't he'd been firing out twenty or<br>thirty at a time but that was his way of<br>establishing those networks and then he<br>might contact one of those to see if he<br>could get through the contacts just a<br>tip with business cards although we tend<br>to not be using them so much now but if<br>you do get a card I'm just right where<br>you met the person or maybe something<br>memorable about them so that they you<br>know sort of their glasses or something<br>that they see or that they've got three<br>children or six cats and then when you<br>email them you can make mention of these<br>six kids because yes you that way<br>remembering them might also help you as<br>far as remembering what it was that you<br>discussed at the time beyond that those<br>sorts of aspects of it as well so we as<br>a network once you've met met those<br>contacts think about where I'm choosing<br>we're Network and remember what Peter<br>said about your purpose because it might<br>be your purpose might actually influence<br>if we choose to network quite a lot so<br>I'm going to start off with in person<br>and some tips for success in there so in<br>person a lot of people think that<br>networking is just events its sessions<br>like this and yes it can be it can be<br>formal networking events but it can also<br>be smaller meetings it can be<br>professional interactions of a variety<br>of sorts or it can be<br>on one meeting so thinking about<br>networking not as just going doing<br>things in big groups but but of all<br>those sort of interactions that you<br>might have with someone is as important<br>important that right at the start of the<br>networking process that you do a little<br>bit of prep that you actually prepare<br>for the interaction this is not always<br>going to be possible but really good if<br>you can actually research the industry<br>that they're in if you can research a<br>little bit more about what they what<br>their industry does because that was<br>also going to help you as far as those<br>conversations go if you dry up you can<br>think oh now I remember that the sector<br>is having this issue so I could throw in<br>a really good conversational game but<br>around this think about the event<br>purpose because if you research that<br>event purpose you're more likely to<br>think and be able to recognize the sorts<br>of people who might be at that event and<br>therefore that can assist you in your<br>preparation and think about questions<br>that you might like to ask again that<br>the whole researching of the event can<br>help you build up those questions<br>because sometimes I'm sure we all have<br>had this it's really hard when you put<br>on the spot and there's that gap in the<br>conversation to actually think of those<br>Christians if you've got some pre-baked<br>ones then you can just sort of haul<br>loads out of your your key today and<br>think yes this is a good time to ask ask<br>that question during the during the<br>networking really important that you<br>think about the how the process and I'm<br>going to talk quite a lot of a bit more<br>about that but bit body language is a<br>part of it being nice asking questions<br>but not asking questions just for your<br>satisfaction asking questions so you<br>know how you can assist them and again<br>when we talked about things being<br>mutually beneficial at being a two-way<br>process that's really do keep that in<br>mind how can you benefit them<br>can they benefit you and difficut in the<br>piece in person afterwards how you're<br>going to follow up how are you going to<br>carry that Network on because really a<br>network conversation that's not carried<br>on as an opportunity missed so it's<br>really really important to think how<br>you're going to further that network and<br>that could be by an email it could be by<br>a LinkedIn connection you may have got<br>on so it's so well and you might have a<br>business card that you might have<br>exchanged business cards and you might<br>organize two-hour to meet up for coffee<br>so so I really do think about how you're<br>going to to do that as well now one<br>thing that people often worry about<br>during the networking process is what am<br>I going to say how am I going to join<br>into a networking interaction again<br>doing that homework seeing who the key<br>people are who might be attending that<br>event again it's not always possible but<br>in this this highly networked in the IT<br>sort of way world it's often possible to<br>get a lot of information about an event<br>you may also be able to see stalk them<br>going through something like LinkedIn so<br>getting a sense of what interests them<br>may make that easier to join in<br>during that networking activity don't<br>forget that again I'm harping on about<br>this I know that the whole mutually<br>beneficial thing means that you actually<br>listen to them rather than talking at<br>them and it's a it's a bit of a risk<br>during during networking particularly if<br>you're nervous sometimes people get sort<br>of the verbal diarrhea and they just<br>sort of talk at people so Britain's<br>taking a big big deep breath and trying<br>to draw their other person out trying to<br>get as much information out of that<br>person as possible though nabel's that<br>connection that enables that that<br>ability to to work with them on a<br>variety of different levels be inclusive<br>don't<br>don't hog that person to yourself<br>so don't monopolize that individuals<br>bring other people into the conversation<br>and that's also part of the whole giving<br>back to the whole network is that if<br>there's someone who obviously wants to<br>join the conversation you you if you<br>bring them in not only are you sort of<br>helping helping the the whole networking<br>thing go on but you're actually also<br>exhibiting to the other people in that<br>group that you actually have good social<br>skills that you care about the about<br>others so it's it reflects well on you<br>so it can it can work on a variety of<br>different levels as I said before make<br>sure that you think about things that<br>you might need to use as far as small<br>talk sometimes in a networking<br>opportunity you may have a lot of stuff<br>that you're going to talk about because<br>of the nature of the opportunity<br>professional associations that are an<br>academic type networking opportunity<br>could be there but you don't know<br>whether that's going to be the case so<br>thinking about things that you might say<br>and I like that there's this quote here<br>as I Drive to a party I try to come up<br>with two or three things to talk about<br>in case the conversation runs dry so<br>it's something that's something again<br>that you can do beforehand that actually<br>that other quotes really important too<br>you don't have to just the golden rule<br>is that you don't have to be brilliant<br>just nice so so during that networking<br>um interaction being nice to people will<br>go a long way I've got a question for<br>you so that slide says how do I join in<br>so you're at a networking event so like<br>tonight's you're in a group how do you<br>leave the group what strategies do you<br>hear do you have sort of like a phrase<br>that you might say oh I just got to go<br>and talk to Tim's and or any yeah yeah<br>getting another drink is quite a common<br>one yeah what else is it the most bits<br>the one there isn't it<br>I think there's another one yeah there<br>is another one yeah another snake<br>another snake go to the Louvre got to go<br>to the bathroom there is that oh I've<br>just didn't seen someone right over the<br>other side of the room that I need to<br>see there's anyone got anything other<br>than those ones interesting now we're<br>all going to be key and sort of teed up<br>for there outweighs the next time we're<br>in a growth oh really<br>okay so I'm really important when you<br>get in that group situation to actually<br>to perform your best to convey the best<br>messages and research says that more<br>than 70% of people's first impressions<br>of you is based on what they see so I've<br>got some images here so we look at these<br>images thinking about what they convey<br>the the gentleman on the left here what<br>sort of what messages is that that first<br>professionalism yeah<br>confident<br>anything else happy how about the how<br>about the one on the right absolutely so<br>so it is it is important what you convey<br>how how you how you present yourself to<br>the world in a whole variety of<br>different ways good point so again if<br>you were going to a particular<br>networking event might you think about<br>what your purpose was<br>might she think about the other people<br>at the event and might she think about<br>how they might be breast dressed before<br>you go to that particular event so again<br>it's about thinking about what's<br>relevant<br>now I love the fact that some now this<br>is the the University of Manchester they<br>have actually created a formula for the<br>perfect ten shake and I had to print<br>this out because there's no way I<br>remember it so it involves eye contact<br>verbal greeting what they call a<br>Duchenne smile I've never heard of that<br>until recently either which is a genuine<br>smile not a fake one the fourth one is a<br>full grip a dry hand a firm handshake<br>the position of the hand equal between<br>two parties strength medium vigor so not<br>too crunchy not too soft temperature<br>texture of the hand and then the<br>duration and would anyone like to guess<br>what the duration should be for a month<br>from this formula two to three seconds<br>yeah okay you're dead right there so one<br>is brief too lot and and and five is too<br>long so say yes I I do love the fact<br>that there's an educational institution<br>has has whipped that out for us<br>but it is actually um that is worth<br>thinking about because again what you<br>read what you wear but also the way that<br>you actually handle that first<br>interaction one thing that some students<br>ask of me is that what of a handshake is<br>not appropriate in their culture and<br>that that's an important thing too so a<br>perfect Angelique for them would be no<br>handshake and the way that I would<br>recommend if that's the the case is just<br>to lean forward and say I'm sorry it's<br>not appropriate for me to handshake and<br>people I've never seen anyone be<br>offended by that I've had that happen to<br>me a number of times and I've never been<br>offended by it either so so it's um is<br>perfectly okay to do that if it's not<br>appropriate next our good old friend<br>body language so it's not just about the<br>handshake think about how your your body<br>conveys<br>and is it conveying what you want it to<br>convey and that can be your body<br>movements um your face your arms it can<br>be your voice your tone your modulation<br>the pauses that you do interestingly<br>only 7% of what you convey in an<br>interaction is actually the spoken word<br>and yes I'd we'd bet to the the check we<br>did the research on this and as that<br>academically blind refereed Radhey<br>Radhey rare things so hit this has<br>actually been Studies on this openness<br>now now looking at these photos who<br>seems to be Nick working is it the photo<br>which which which one would you be more<br>so so that that's really important on<br>the alcohol sorry<br>and all because I got a little glass of<br>wine before I don't know I haven't<br>touched it I'm not touching it<br>afterwards I had to think about the<br>nerves<br>moving right along you'll also see that<br>here just the way that she's standing<br>with her own hands like it really<br>doesn't convey that she's wanting to be<br>talked to<br>whereas apart from the alcohol here<br>they're actually they're looking quite<br>open than the position of their bodies<br>the position of their arms is actually<br>welcomed people people welcoming people<br>to approach so you think if you were in<br>that particular situation and you were<br>standing there like this I don't think<br>that most people would feel quite so<br>welcome quite so like coming up and<br>talking to you in that situation so when<br>you first go into our rooms scan the<br>groups and you face me for a minute even<br>so if Tamsin and I sorta like talk stand<br>in front on like that and sort of like<br>seem intense and conversation you<br>wouldn't go into that group but if we're<br>kind of sort of you know still talking<br>but we're more open like this that's the<br>group that you could join and we would<br>be very inclusive oh yeah but you can<br>say they can also it can it can be a an<br>indicator to people that you're<br>welcoming other people coming along you<br>know this is this is an interesting one<br>and I'm going to get it you to to to to<br>to sort of come in in personal space can<br>be a really really major problem for<br>you're like oh like people getting too<br>close to me and so it would be too bad<br>but that would be too far so think about<br>when you're approaching people think<br>about their personal space<br>think about how comfortable they're<br>going to be one of the tricky things is<br>that people different people have really<br>different personal spaces and I was at a<br>networking opportunity a couple of few<br>weeks ago and I realized that yeah I was<br>going like this because this person was<br>getting closer and closer and and then I<br>got double get someone okay I'm stuck so<br>so but it can actually it started to<br>distract me it started to really throw<br>me so so it can be something that will<br>can Mac you up a bit it's very much it's<br>an individual thing but it's also very<br>much a cultural thing as well so<br>different cultures different distances<br>yep<br>I actually I have to decide on to<br>someone and to carry on talking to them<br>but to incite onto them so so so David<br>sort of can I was doing this and they<br>don't like this okay so yeah cuz I'm<br>gonna be cat you can't really carry I<br>can't really move it any closer idea but<br>we had a pretty much so say here so<br>think about the intimate space think<br>about the personal space and then think<br>about the social space now because it<br>may it may differ it can be it can be<br>tricky but um but really do think and<br>look at those those cues that body<br>language if that person is going back<br>then it probably means that they're<br>getting a little bit freaked out by how<br>close you're getting so think ah okay<br>don't want to make them feel upset I'm<br>going to um I'm going to adapt to this<br>one of the tricky things though is that<br>if it's really noisy then sometimes you<br>actually you feel that you need to get<br>closer together to actually still be<br>able to hear and that's where sometimes<br>leaning in is a better way of doing it<br>because you're not you know you may sort<br>of be the listen it more eagerly<br>listening to them but you're not getting<br>your whole body to close to them and it<br>can it can be less disquieting eye<br>contact really really important in<br>helping you to establish connections<br>because people are really quite<br>sensitive to where you look and I hope<br>though I think this is this is slightly<br>amusing but I think it is fear is that<br>business gaze and into the into the eyes<br>and the forehead social gaze more the<br>full face an intimate gaze more of the<br>body so so think about that it can it<br>can be quite interesting however because<br>you know what do you don't want to also<br>don't want to steer into people's eyes<br>and I've been on an interview panel<br>where the person I didn't blink and be<br>sort of nailed me by the end of an<br>esophagus though you thought like like<br>x-rays so thank you so that can be<br>slightly freaky but if there's too<br>little they can actually be a lack of<br>engagement so I think different that's<br>definitely it's a balance thing also<br>consider in the networking that you<br>wanted again be inclusive so if you're<br>just looking at one person in a group<br>then you're actually kind of excluding<br>the other people in the group so so<br>think about that and your networking<br>opportunities as well they talk about<br>eye contact also conveying presence and<br>presence conveying power so that's<br>something to think about as well as that<br>through through that eye contact you're<br>actually showing that you're very<br>present in the interaction also can that<br>show that you're paying attention and<br>that whole thing around being being<br>connected to being relating to people is<br>terribly important now<br>next hour I'm our whole building rapport<br>thing I think that again this goes back<br>to the mutual beneficial aspect of<br>things if you want things to be mutually<br>beneficial then you're actually going to<br>have to build connections you're going<br>to have to engage the other person and<br>the way that you can do that is by<br>building rapport and I'm hacking back to<br>the things I've talked about before but<br>ways of building rapport is through I<br>can't contact is through openness is<br>through the body position there's three<br>they hurt your whole body language it's<br>also being overt about the fact that<br>you're interested and what they're<br>saying<br>and I've read this thing that I think<br>thought was fantastic<br>be interested before being interesting<br>and so thinking about what you're giving<br>to the networking relationship before<br>you think about what you're going to<br>take from that networking relationship<br>so I thought that I thought there's a<br>good quite a good good little thing to<br>actually remind me anyway about the<br>importance of listening as well as<br>speaking in a networking situation<br>Tamsin and I went to an event on Friday<br>night and so we were having a nice<br>pleasant conversation with someone but<br>it was one of those ones where every so<br>often there was a pause were you all<br>thinking what on earth are we going to<br>say next<br>and they came on for a while you know it<br>was going on okay and then I was we were<br>in one of those pauses and it was oh he<br>mentioned something about lawn bowls Oh<br>what club do you play bowls and so then<br>he sort of like seared and he said do<br>you play and I said no but I know<br>someone who did and then thankfully<br>Tamsin's father plays balls and kerikeri<br>and then his eyes lit up it was like a<br>switch had gone on and what's been<br>tested for me because I could just stand<br>back and Thames and unhand us went for<br>it and all about Kirikiri and the<br>environment and a pub came into it the<br>Thames and wanted to buy and it was a<br>great conversation really interesting<br>but it was just that one comment and it<br>would have gone on for probably seven or<br>eight minutes the conversation that came<br>out of that single comment today it was<br>yeah and it was fascinating the whole<br>place were the places we went but also<br>how we then started to establish mutual<br>friends and those sorts of things so out<br>of that came a networking opportunity<br>that I wasn't expecting when I went<br>along to their data event that night I<br>now this is an area that Peter has more<br>knowledge of it's another place to them<br>it's another way to build rapport and<br>that's matching and mirroring the<br>expressions of others and and I remember<br>you speaking at a session recently about<br>doing a movie or at an airport or<br>something like that or a cafe and you<br>were watching a group of people and how<br>they all started to show the same<br>gestures and reflect the fact that they<br>were actually really engaged with the<br>people through that Murrow ring is<br>actually a counseling technique so if a<br>counselor is trying to sort of build<br>rapport they will actually consciously<br>mirror your movements so if you're<br>sitting there so like like in that case<br>they've got their hands under their chin<br>so a counselor will deliberately<br>just match your movements and you don't<br>realize that but it makes you start to<br>feel more comfortable but we do it<br>naturally so if we're people that we<br>feel comfortable with if we've with<br>friends we just do it and it's actually<br>fascinating to watch<br>and so in cafes if I'm on my own I'll<br>sort of like to start people watching<br>and look at the different groups of<br>people and see how many are actually<br>doing this and just even when sort of<br>like a group of friends are talking as<br>well just watching them and slowly over<br>time they'll start matching and<br>mirroring it is really fun to watch but<br>if you ever go and see your counselor<br>that's what they're doing and of course<br>last but definitely not least I guess<br>I've hit a few goals across the room one<br>way of engaging yourself with other<br>people is actually to remember their<br>names now I should not be talking about<br>this because I am the world's worst<br>person as far as remembering names I<br>know the tools I use the tools I'm still<br>completely and utterly useless that I'll<br>tell you about those tools because it<br>really does help on that whole rapport<br>building process one of them are forget<br>of course as<br>the person says their name is to repeat<br>their name and then use their name a few<br>more times in the interaction hopefully<br>that will some enters into your brain<br>there's the the the word association<br>aspect of things so it could be that you<br>associate their name with a particular<br>thing so it could be if their name is<br>gatehouse that you think okay so when<br>I'm thinking of that person I think of a<br>gate and you visualize the gate and then<br>you visualize a house so you could do so<br>those that sort of weird Association<br>another way as weird Association but<br>thinking about okay I was at this event<br>and I was talking about such-and-such<br>and I met Joe and so you you work<br>through it that way and you there's up<br>sort of a pathway to remembering that so<br>another way as and it's particularly<br>important if the person's name is a<br>tricky one my name I never thought of my<br>name is has been particularly tricky<br>tenzin but a lot of people either must<br>hear it as Tesman<br>yes I'm a very engaged see yes but also<br>it's it's it's just a bit of an unusual<br>name so one way that people can actually<br>use that to help remember is actually by<br>thinking okay Tenzin that the sheet she<br>said her name wasn't Tesman so if I see<br>her again I'll think okay her name's not<br>Tesman its Tenzin<br>so clarifying as unusual names can can<br>be helpful as well so those are all<br>techniques that you could utilize or you<br>could just be like me and be really<br>embarrassed and say look sorry I've<br>forgotten your name but or or bluffin<br>and sometimes you can do that too<br>remembering names is another way of<br>building rapport even sort of like name<br>tags are tricky things because you've<br>got to be careful about with your gazes<br>of course but if you can sort of like<br>just have a quick look at the name tag<br>and actually<br>is the name makes a difference and it's<br>something that you can practice at a<br>supermarket all the checkout operators<br>have name text so then you can actually<br>practice surreptitiously looking and<br>then actually using their name and it's<br>interesting how they face often lights<br>so what do you think about that who<br>would rather be called by the wrong name<br>or would you rather they just said sorry<br>I've forgotten your name another way to<br>save yourself if you really have<br>forgotten their name is to do to him a<br>context establishing conversation great<br>to see you again when did we last see<br>each other okay that gives me a clue<br>always last saw each other at<br>such-and-such<br>what have you been up to since then so<br>you can actually you can through it a<br>little bit of questioning build up and<br>you may remember their name you may not<br>but even if you don't remember their<br>name you may actually remember work out<br>enough from that to be able to hold a<br>very good networking conversation<br>without remembering their name and then<br>desperately go onto LinkedIn and search<br>under a variety of ways to see if you<br>can find their name afterwards so what<br>I'm now going to do is I'm going to<br>get you to do a little exercise your<br>elevator pitch it's a really really<br>useful thing to have within a networking<br>situation in any sort of networking<br>situation a useful way to structure it<br>is to think about who you are what<br>you've done and what you want number<br>three there than what you want will vary<br>immensely depending on what the purpose<br>of the interaction is or the context in<br>which you're actually meeting the clears<br>it person so what you want you may have<br>a whole variety of different ones so<br>your elevator pitch is never going to be<br>exactly the same from time to time<br>you're going to vary it appropriate to<br>your purpose also in your elevator pitch<br>you're going to actually be thinking<br>about all the things that I've just<br>talked about so the building of rapport<br>the bodily language and all those sorts<br>of things so so I'm thinking about all<br>those aspects of it when you deliver<br>that here like they made a pitch so you<br>make it as engaging as possible<br>so what I'm going to do is some I'll<br>give you a minute or so to think about<br>what your elevator pitch is and you can<br>you can make the make up the purpose<br>yourself so you can decide what you want<br>appropriate to this purpose and I'd like<br>you to deliver the your elevator pitch<br>to the person next door to you okay did<br>anyone learn any fascinating facts and<br>that yes I can see some nods or really<br>would you like to share the fascinating<br>fact<br>okay so go from accounting and law to<br>writing box brilliant any other<br>okay any anyone who talked to someone<br>who they thought oh I wish I'd talk to<br>this person before because now I<br>actually wanted to get to know this<br>person more yes it's a lot increased a<br>couple of non a couple of nods there<br>yeah so I'm so yes so the great thing<br>about your elevator pitch is like Peter<br>said you could actually you could<br>practice that with the checkout operator<br>the bank teller you could coffee guy<br>your dog your and your nearest and<br>dearest because it is one of these<br>things that the more you actually<br>practice that the more you refine it and<br>the better you get at delivering it as<br>well the better you get at incorporating<br>all those other activities because if<br>you deliver it to your family or your<br>nearest and dearest um they're surely<br>going to be really critical of what you<br>say but they can also give you some<br>really good tips they can give you some<br>stuff that might make it much much<br>better so without further ado because we<br>need to go from personal networking now<br>on to online networking I'm going to<br>hand over to Peter so online networking<br>it's basically email you might be in<br>some sort of foreign forums obviously<br>social media so Facebook LinkedIn if<br>it's professional so there are a lot of<br>different mediums that you can use for<br>online networking you need to think<br>about what you're more to achieve so<br>with any sort of online prison think<br>about your aim if you're sending an<br>email to someone what's the purpose of<br>the email if you're joining Twitter or<br>joining LinkedIn why are you joining<br>those those social media networks what<br>is actually best for the purpose so sort<br>of Facebook is that the best place to<br>build professional networks or as<br>LinkedIn a better place<br>is Twitter finding news getting news and<br>information maybe its Twitter would be<br>better so think about what you're<br>actually trying to achieve what media<br>would be best and then think about it<br>sort of split it out between<br>professional and personal so a lot of us<br>when we sort of like first got onto<br>Facebook you know you basically it was a<br>numbers game and you let anyone join and<br>they were all your friends so suddenly<br>you hit were friends with people that<br>you wouldn't recognize if you walked<br>past them on the street so at some point<br>a lot of us started thinking about<br>whether that was appropriate or not a<br>standard Joe our standing joke is that<br>at Christmastime I have a look at my<br>facebook list and I think about what I<br>want to tell you something personal<br>would I recognize you as I was walking<br>down the street and if the answer was no<br>and no Merry Christmas delete Merry<br>Christmas<br>Facebook is really shrinking for me but<br>LinkedIn is growing so think about sort<br>of yeah will they be the same also do<br>you have time to do it well so social<br>media in particular looks very sad if<br>it's sitting there neglected and loved<br>you're not actually updating it nothing<br>said oh really<br>think about the benefits and the risks<br>and also - from a work perspective if<br>your job is going online so say it's<br>using LinkedIn and making connections<br>make very sure that you know who owns<br>those connections if it's part of your<br>job it's quite possible that your<br>employer might own them not you if<br>you're doing them work time part of your<br>job you leave you could lose all of<br>those connections so just be very clear<br>so it's the planned side of things the<br>whole thing about online whether it's<br>email or whether it's social media<br>whether at some sort of forum is about<br>promoting your personal brand so we do a<br>whole workshop on branding we also do a<br>whole workshop on to workshops on<br>LinkedIn so I'm summarizing three<br>workshops and three slides yeah you mean<br>but it's also being active its<br>participating so if you join the network<br>it is a really good idea to participate<br>and participation can take the sort of<br>shape of you know it might be sharing<br>articles it could just be liking<br>someone's post it could be coming up<br>with a discussion you can be as active<br>or as little as you want but being a bit<br>active is a really good idea then again<br>just don't overdo it so you don't want<br>to start spamming and be that person who<br>is always posting and you sort of look a<br>bit do they actually have a job what's<br>with this think about whether the brains<br>appropriate for the channel so I sort of<br>mentioned LinkedIn I mentioned Facebook<br>I mentioned Twitter these Instagram so<br>for Facebook for me it's friends and<br>family LinkedIn is very definitely<br>professional and a friends and family<br>want to connect with me I've very gently<br>sort of say sorry it's professional and<br>then also Twitter every so often I think<br>I've just got to get up give up Twitter<br>but I stick with it because my audience<br>on Twitter is actually academics there's<br>some really interesting information that<br>academics come out with that I'm<br>interested in so I've got different<br>audiences<br>friends family professional academics so<br>then you think about your audience you<br>think about the brand that you're<br>promoting to them it's like those<br>clothes Twitter more casual interest<br>LinkedIn you're wearing a tie so it's<br>the same sort of thing so think about<br>so I've talked a lot about LinkedIn so<br>before I came up I just had a quick look<br>at some numbers for you so it was<br>founded in 2003 and apparently there's<br>500 million users on LinkedIn so it's<br>not as big as Facebook but there are two<br>new members per second and if you just<br>want to look at University of Auckland<br>on its own there's one hundred and<br>twenty four thousand three hundred and<br>fifty plus they say it's alumni it's<br>sort of its alumni but it's also some<br>current students as well because Tamsin<br>and I just keep making them sign up on<br>LinkedIn so it's ass if you connect with<br>someone on LinkedIn so from a networking<br>perspective so say tonight so you go<br>back you go and connect with someone<br>don't just sort of send the connection<br>request the standard automated one<br>there's an option to add a note so add<br>the note and tell them we've met them so<br>I met you at the Careers evening just<br>some sort of context or if you've never<br>met them but you want to connect with<br>them because you really like the type of<br>role they're doing or the organization<br>they work for or maybe it's just that<br>they also went to the University of<br>Auckland and you can find out all that<br>stuff on LinkedIn so just let them know<br>why you want to connect with them how<br>you might have met them it increases the<br>chances that they will just<br>automatically go except it's done but<br>when I get a request and TIMSS ins the<br>same if we don't know who the person is<br>we delay it because we've got to go and<br>look at their profile so we wait for<br>later and later might not either come so<br>if you want to make that connection<br>really good to give them some context<br>also to this some fun facts under fun<br>facts these five point five million<br>accountants on LinkedIn yeah I thought<br>that was interesting and the average CEO<br>has nine hundred and thirty connections<br>it is a really interesting place so you<br>could sort of like have a look at<br>University of Auckland alumni you can<br>figure out how many of them work in<br>Auckland or in Dubai or wherever it is<br>you can figure out where they work<br>what they're rollers as well so there's<br>a lot of research and a lot of<br>connections that you can make through<br>that form one tip apparently the word<br>motivated in 2014 and 2015 was the most<br>overused word and LinkedIn so when<br>you're doing your profile just have a<br>look and see if you've used that rhythm<br>if you just take it out so there it's<br>got you know basically it's getting<br>notice so it's just like Facebook but<br>it's they call it Facebook with a tie<br>so it's posting its taking part in the<br>forums if you don't want to do any of<br>that use it for research and making<br>those connections it's one of the best<br>ways it's getting better and better from<br>that perspective so it pretty much<br>brings us to the end this evening so<br>think of networking as connecting and<br>having conversations it's a conversation<br>whether it's in person or whether it's<br>online identify what you want to achieve<br>so have some sort of purpose ensure that<br>you give a great first impression it's<br>the handshake it's your body language<br>its eye contact building rapport<br>watching your personal distances being<br>organized so develop your elevator pitch<br>you have a different one for different<br>situations different purposes update<br>your social media and keep it updated<br>regularly work out how you're going to<br>manage your networks if you're going<br>back to sort of what I said about that<br>first impression if it's online think<br>about the words and images you use<br>online to promote your brand network<br>with existing context attend events join<br>professional associations extend your<br>network as much as you can just a little<br>bit outside your comfort zone and then<br>over time your comfort zone will get a<br>little bit bigger so you're extending it<br>and then form genuine relationships in<br>also that final point nurture those<br>relationships thank you for coming this<br>evening I think we might almost be on<br>time has anyone got any questions<br>awesome</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
