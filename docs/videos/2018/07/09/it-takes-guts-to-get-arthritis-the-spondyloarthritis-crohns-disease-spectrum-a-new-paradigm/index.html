These two conditions not only demonstrate many common phenotypic characteristics, but also share a common genetic risk. Both may be triggered by dysbiosis within the intestinal microbiota. <br><br>Gut inflammation is a frequent sub-clinical manifestation of AS and arthritis a common extra-intestinal manifestation of Crohn’s disease. This talk will take the form of two diametrically opposed, vituperative duelling specialists each with their own narrow and transparent agendas attempting to take sole ownership for this new dialectic.<br><br>Presented by  Associate Professor Simon Stebbings | Consultant Physician in Rheumatology https://www.otago.ac.nz/dsm/people/expertise/profile/?id=775 <br><br>Associate Professor

grand round and we've got<br>a particularly interesting topic that's<br>right at the cutting edge of current<br>science formal topic and take takes guts<br>to get arthritis the spondyloarthritis<br>Crohn's disease spectrum is there a new<br>paradigm now there's been a lot of work<br>in the scientific literature over the<br>last what 10 years probably increasing<br>the number of publications looking at<br>the relation between the cuts and<br>everything actually whether it goes from<br>obesity to arthritis to mental health<br>and so it seems like the gut as as a<br>major focus of just about every<br>discipline you want to talk about these<br>days so it is my pleasure to welcome<br>Michael Schultz and Simon Stebbings to<br>talk about their combination one a<br>gastroenterologist one a Rheumatologist<br>and I'm looking forward very much to<br>hearing Wallace space integrated into<br>one presentation so anything over to<br>who's going first<br>thank you very much Barry thank you very<br>much for this nice introduction and<br>homing in on the gut here Simon why you<br>here we've about the joints so you see<br>it's starting out quite nicely and we<br>already hit this discussion so this can<br>go either horribly wrong here this<br>afternoon or this lunchtime or it can<br>actually be a quite useful discussion<br>between the two of us and obviously<br>Simon and I have done this before but in<br>this town a bit but not in such a formal<br>way Simon invited me to speak at the<br>Rheumatology meeting so I was there in a<br>room of 400 rheumatologist and my task<br>was to convince them that actually<br>spondyloarthritis is a gastrin<br>theological disease so yeah needless to<br>say I missed the margin about by that<br>much I think he had some home advantage<br>there but we'll try this again so on the<br>agenda today is I'll tell you a little<br>bit of our Tron's disease Simon will<br>tell you a little bit about<br>spondyloarthritis but then what we<br>really want to bring across today is the<br>overlap the overlap that<br>this in the genetic sphere in the<br>microbiome there's a lot of clinical<br>overlap which Simon and I have done some<br>research on that's the studies from<br>Otago that we've performed in the last<br>few years we look at how can we treat<br>not one disease or the other disease how<br>can we come true to an agreement of<br>treating the spectrum and then we we<br>glimpse into the future and see what's<br>what's going on in the future now it<br>starts off with inflammatory bowel<br>disease before salmon will take over<br>with spawn of arthritis and needless to<br>say inflammatory bowel disease is an<br>important disease you might not think<br>the numbers are particularly high but<br>they are on the increase so at the<br>moment New Zealand probably has about<br>20,000 to 23,000 patients with<br>inflammatory bowel disease and this is<br>reflected in Otago as well that over the<br>last few years and this is some research<br>that I've done together with kist and<br>cappell who just talked to me about the<br>revision of the paper because this on<br>the brink of publication that we had an<br>increase here in Otago as well and if<br>you look at the the slide down here in<br>in the corner this is the bell shaped<br>curve harvest diseases in the world and<br>you can see your target Nelson and<br>Christchurch are right at the upper end<br>of this bell-shaped curve so that means<br>we really have a lot of this disease and<br>we probably almost leading the world<br>here in terms of incidence now what is<br>inflammatory bowel disease it's in it's<br>it's crohn's disease also if colitis and<br>we have a few patients left over that we<br>can't classify these these patients they<br>have a picture that could fit both and<br>some of those patients do declare<br>themselves it's either having trans<br>disease or also if colitis down the<br>roads but initially they might not be so<br>easy to explain but if you do a<br>colonoscopy on those patients you see<br>right here so if colitis does look quite<br>different to Crohn's disease Crohn's<br>disease has big ulcers which just kind<br>of seemingly normal mucosa in between<br>where sorts of colitis is a continuous<br>disease is to logically we also have<br>this picture here that Arsuf colitis is<br>more affecting the surface so it's a<br>surface disease and that kind of tells<br>us a little bit about the clinical<br>presentation of this disease as well<br>whereas Crohn's disease is transmural so<br>the information goes right<br>down through the wall of the<br>gastrointestinal tract and it came that<br>therefore lead to abscess formation and<br>fistula zation and things like that the<br>distribution of the disease is also<br>quite different also of colitis and the<br>name takes it away is is located in the<br>large intestine most patients have<br>perianal involvement but then it works<br>itself out left-sided colitis or pend<br>colitis restaurants disease can affect<br>you really from top to bottom it can<br>start with mouth observations and can go<br>all the way through to the other end<br>with perianal crohn's disease and<br>everything in the middle this is<br>obviously reflecting then also the<br>clinical presentation patients with<br>crohn's disease often present with<br>weight loss but not so much with bloody<br>diarrhea as patients with ulcerative<br>colitis would you despite the disease<br>being known for many many many years in<br>lots of research and Barry alluded to<br>that into these disorders we we are kind<br>of not really much closer to knowing<br>actually where this disease comes from<br>so this theory that my previous mentor<br>Basu Sartre put on here in 2006 pretty<br>much still stands it was like that ten<br>years before he put it into this nice<br>colorful picture and it still stands<br>that fluency bowel disease is probably a<br>multi-faceted as disease it has to do<br>with aberrant microbial antigen<br>presentation aberrant immune response<br>some environmental triggers and<br>obviously all that needs to happen in a<br>genetically susceptible patient so if we<br>take this into detail evidence for<br>genetic susceptibility was along known<br>because we know that there is a family<br>history and in a lot of those patients<br>when we have new patients presenting<br>with inflammatory bowel disease by the<br>number have a family history five to<br>fifteen and you can drill this down a<br>little bit further and look into<br>siblings the risk is about two to five<br>percent right up to two parents it's up<br>to 36 percent wonder where these two<br>parents met probably in one of the<br>support groups and then exposing their<br>children to this high risk of also<br>having inflammatory bowel disease and<br>and over there on the other side you see<br>the risk in monozygotic and dizygotic<br>twins so Crohn's disease really high in<br>monozygotic twins where it's not so much<br>I don't want to I want you to ask to<br>stay away from these lovely food outlets<br>here and this is not really the topic of<br>this talk it's just kind of exemplifying<br>the westernization that takes place in<br>probably with the westernization the<br>rise of these autoimmune and<br>inflammatory bowel diseases we clearly<br>see that where there is lots of coffee<br>cups you have lots of inflammatory bowel<br>disease where there's a big golden arch<br>we have lots of inflammatory bowel<br>disease whereas around the equator we<br>have less of that now that obviously has<br>to take in with a little bit of a grain<br>of salt here because these these<br>countries that are around the equator<br>the health system is obviously not as<br>developed as as the health system on by<br>the other sides of the equator maybe we<br>don't look at that so much maybe we<br>don't find it so much there but on the<br>other hand other factors play a role<br>they are infections in these countries<br>much higher than in the countries<br>further away from the equator so maybe<br>that's a protective role if you have<br>helminthic disease it's been shown that<br>this is possibly protecting against<br>inflammatory bowel disease all that<br>comes into into the game but what we see<br>more and more is that countries that now<br>come into a Western influence fear and<br>Western eyes much more in those<br>countries we can identify a vast<br>increase of inflammatory bowel disease<br>and this is this is true on this on this<br>graph here as well which then really<br>looks at the incidence of inflammatory<br>bowel disease again the picture that I<br>showed very early on was that down here<br>little New Zealand in this corner at<br>least I found a map windshield and so on<br>but in this corner here very high<br>incidence of inflammatory bowel disease<br>amongst the highest of the world so that<br>makes this disease quite interesting how<br>do we diagnose this disease well it's a<br>disease of the intestines and how do we<br>do this best we do a colonoscopy on<br>these patients or we do a capsule<br>endoscopy and for a few years now we can<br>do also an MRI scan which is which is<br>over here which shows lovely picture of<br>a thickened bowel wall with some<br>dilatation here and a narrowing probably<br>a stricture further down towards the<br>further down here so crohn's disease<br>again we have these big observations<br>here and<br>so if colitis we have more this kind of<br>homogenous isolated pictures the capsule<br>endoscopy is is a tool that can look<br>into the small intestine so patients get<br>a small capsule to swallow they carry a<br>little receiving device with them and<br>for about eight hours the capsule will<br>send pictures to this receiving device<br>in my I can then spend two or three<br>hours looking at a monitor a marvelous<br>film of the capsule traveling through<br>the small intestine and we can count<br>these houses here in patients with small<br>intestinal inflammatory bowel disease<br>what we shouldn't forget though is that<br>both of these disorders are multi<br>systemic disorders they are not just<br>affecting the gut in there it's quite<br>known that a lot of other presentations<br>can happen with inflammatory bowel<br>disease we we do see after stomatitis we<br>see our righties uveitis we see oligo<br>arthritis and this is where simon comes<br>into the game some of these<br>manifestations are related to the gut<br>inflammation some are not but that's<br>something that makes them then very<br>difficult to diagnose but anyway the<br>disease can present in a lot of<br>different presentations if we home in on<br>the on the joint and skeletal system a<br>little bit so we see here the extra into<br>style manifestations all of them are<br>between 15 and 20 percent in Crohn's<br>disease a little bit higher some of<br>these far are dependent on the bowel<br>disease activity like oligarch rightists<br>and so on and so forth some are<br>independent and there we have the<br>ankylosing spondylitis about ten to<br>eleven percent of all our patients will<br>develop a spondylitis like picture which<br>then brings Simon on to the plan to talk<br>about that thank you Michael<br>yes so now we get down to the<br>interesting bit which is patients who<br>actually develop us on the low arthritis<br>within this context of inflammatory<br>bowel disease so the spondyloarthritis<br>ease this sort of concept of<br>interrelated disorders which has really<br>come together over the last sort of 15<br>years so it's a spectrum of conditions<br>which has a very strong familial<br>predisposition tends to run in families<br>and the most typical<br>for miss ankylosing spondylitis which<br>has been identified really for the last<br>hundred years and spondyloarthritis key<br>aspect of this condition is inflammatory<br>back pain which particularly affects the<br>sacroiliac joints and that's the<br>predominant presentation in these groups<br>of conditions but about 40% of patients<br>also develop extra-articular<br>manifestations at some point during<br>their disease so these are the cardinal<br>features of inflammatory back pain which<br>differentiate it from mechanical back<br>pain there are five ones which have<br>really been identified by international<br>consensus so you can see from this that<br>one of the key aspects is that patients<br>present young so usually in their late<br>teens or early twenties with with<br>inflammatory back pain it tends to be<br>insidious it's improved by exercise on<br>like mechanical pain and gets worse with<br>rest and often people will wake at night<br>with pain and one of the important<br>aspects of the ankylosing spondylitis<br>spectrum is its effect on quality of<br>life so if we look at this graph here<br>this table we can see a range of<br>different conditions here and these are<br>quality of life measures in the eq-5d<br>and what you might see from that is that<br>across the range of all these different<br>manifestations of quality of life people<br>with ankylosing spondylitis come off<br>worse than other chronic conditions<br>including those with cancer so this is a<br>very serious condition in terms of<br>patient quality of life and this is sort<br>of illustrated by this famous picture of<br>a u.s. airman in the 1940s and his<br>progression over a period of 30 years<br>with his ankylosing spondylitis from a<br>fit man to someone who's very disabled<br>so beyond the articular system the aches<br>heel involvement in the spine there are<br>a number of other areas which are<br>involved too so initial presentation is<br>usually with inflammatory back pain and<br>then you get this late ankylosis<br>occurring particularly at the sacroiliac<br>joints with<br>lumber thoracic and cervical spine and<br>also involvement of the ribs and the<br>costovertebral joints which can affect<br>breathing and then other aspects include<br>peripheral arthritis which often affects<br>the lower limbs and this Cardinal<br>feature here which is end the situs and<br>this is felt to be perhaps the first<br>lesion in the condition so probably the<br>initial site of pathology is at the<br>emphasis where tendons attach to bones<br>so this is common at the tender Achilles<br>here and we can often see that shown on<br>an ultrasound scan as well with<br>information is showing up there and<br>often the involvement is very widespread<br>and I think this is why quality of life<br>is affected so I quite like this bone<br>scan here and it just shows the extent<br>of the involvement throughout the spine<br>say Priory at joints and the<br>sternoclavicular joint so it's a very<br>widespread conditioning really and<br>that's why it's so detrimental to<br>quality of life so um michael has<br>already talked about extra intestinal<br>manifestations of inflammatory bowel<br>disease I like to think more of<br>extra-articular manifestations really of<br>which inflammatory bowel disease is one<br>round about 40 percent nearly half of<br>patients with ankylosing spondylitis<br>will develop an extra articular<br>manifestation it depends a little bit<br>how you how you define that some would<br>say a lot more do but in terms of the<br>common associations which have a genetic<br>and immunological link with inflammatory<br>bowel disease and closing spondylitis<br>these are the ones that we see so<br>uveitis affects about half of patients<br>and as you can see up to 20% of people<br>will develop inflammatory bowel disease<br>within the context of enclosing<br>spondylitis of those who have extra<br>intestinal manifestations and these<br>manifestations really affect quality of<br>life - so this is dramatically shown<br>with the psoriasis of course which is a<br>very obvious way of of seeing the effect<br>that it can have on people and also with<br>uveitis which is very painful and often<br>really affects people<br>ability to work for short periods and<br>people will get recurrent episodes of<br>uveitis throughout their disease and the<br>instance of uveitis increases the longer<br>you have and closing spondylitis or on<br>others on our property and if we think<br>about the spectrum of disease now then<br>this is the new paradigm really so I'm<br>putting inflammatory bowel disease<br>within the spectrum of on low arthritis<br>and we can see that as Michael has said<br>these extra tequila or extra intestinal<br>manifestations like psoriasis and UV I<br>to span the spectrum and at one end we<br>might think of people having ankylosing<br>spondylitis the typical egg seals on low<br>arthropathy and at the other<br>inflammatory bowel disease but across<br>the range we see a sort of gradation of<br>of manifestations through reactive<br>arthritis and psoriatic arthritis but<br>all interrelated conditions<br>neurologically genetically and<br>clinically so if we come to the genetics<br>of ankylosing spondylitis and the<br>spondyloarthropathies like with<br>inflammatory bowel disease but with<br>knobs on we've got a strong familial<br>history and genetic predisposition so<br>unlike the poultry monozygotic twin<br>correlation in inflammatory bowel<br>disease<br>75% of monozygotic twins with ankylosing<br>spondylitis will have a concordance with<br>their disease process and if you have a<br>sibling or a parent a first-degree<br>relative ankylosing spondylitis your<br>risk of developing that to yourself is<br>90 times that of the general population<br>so a very strong complex genetic<br>inheritance the most strong association<br>in human disease and this is<br>predominantly associated with one gene<br>in particular the MHC class 1 gene HLA<br>b27 which many of you will have heard of<br>and here's the gene it looks a bit like<br>a a baseball glove waiting to catch an<br>antigen so it's for antigen presentation<br>its gene and if you have HLA b27 you<br>have a 40 times risk to develop things<br>under<br>arthritis but this isn't the whole story<br>because when you look at the general<br>population a lot of healthy people have<br>b27 so in New Zealand for instance<br>nearly 10% of the population carry this<br>gene a little less if you're Maori so um<br>what are the other genetic risks which<br>confer additional risk on top of this<br>gene well we do know that many other<br>genes feed into this and we can see this<br>because with your increasing distance of<br>relation from people your risk Falls<br>dramatically so if you have a<br>first-degree relative you have a very<br>high risk here but once you get to<br>second or third degree relatives the<br>risk falls off dramatically and this<br>demonstrates that this is a poly genetic<br>disease which has a number of other<br>genes involved interestingly if we look<br>beyond this b27 gene into these<br>interrelated genes we can see quite a<br>strong core risk with inflammatory bowel<br>disease so as we've seen already very<br>strong risk in first-degree relatives 94<br>times with inflammatory bowel disease if<br>you have a first-degree relative it's a<br>paltry 4.4 percent so much less<br>genetically inherited but look at this<br>cross risk here so if you have<br>ankylosing spondylitis you have almost<br>the same risk of developing IBD as if<br>you had a first degree relative with<br>inflammatory bowel disease so a very<br>strong Co correlation there between<br>these two diseases and there's a wide<br>variety of immunological target genes<br>which have been there Lou sedated over<br>recent years and more and more have been<br>coming out with gos and genetic studies<br>so in total up to the present time I<br>think round about two to three hundred<br>it's changing every week really the<br>genetic burden is being teased out that<br>some of these may only have a very small<br>cofactor in the development of these<br>diseases so that kind of leads us on to<br>the next bit which I might let you talk<br>about Michael I think you've just<br>genetic environmental trait<br>you very much it's funny what people are<br>part of genetics is nothing to be proud<br>of this just going one word on the<br>genetics I mean obviously that helps a<br>tremendous lot in in looking at the<br>clinic of these patients because it<br>makes you aware of what you should be<br>looking for and and when Simon and I<br>started working together suddenly more<br>and more patients came forward with this<br>kind of coexisting problem because<br>patients that I see would tell me why<br>should I tell you about my back pain<br>because you're my gut doctor you you<br>don't deal with back pain and I'm sure<br>Simon had the same problem why should I<br>tell you about the frequency of my bowel<br>motions when you are just interested in<br>how my joints are feeling so you really<br>have to tease it out and once you start<br>doing that more and more patients will<br>come forward and actually admit to you<br>well now that you're asking yes I<br>actually can't function in the morning<br>it takes a little while until I'm more<br>active or I have my pain and in my lower<br>back and I'm pretty sure you saw the<br>same thing happening with with frequency<br>of bowel habit and stuff like that and<br>we talked about that clinical<br>presentation a little bit later now<br>besides the genetic overlap there's a<br>big overlap in the microbiome and<br>obviously the microbiome the human<br>microbiome has been the flavor of the<br>recent years it I think personally it's<br>still in the developmental phase we'll<br>see whether that leads are somewhere<br>personally I'm a little bit disappointed<br>with the genetics because we get more<br>and more of these genes being identified<br>but in clinical practice they don't<br>really help us you have 25 risk factors<br>for inflammatory bowel disease so what<br>and I fall so 25 are lotions so that's<br>kind of a little bit difficult to tease<br>out there and I'm not quite sure if the<br>studies on the human human microbiome<br>will go the same way but it's in a<br>fascinating area to be involved in it's<br>the largest reservoir of commensal<br>bacteria and the GI tract and it's it<br>harbors a tremendous amount of species<br>500 I thought it's more a thousand in<br>the mean time because again like with<br>the genome you get more and more the<br>more you can find by refining techniques<br>so what role does the human microbiome<br>play here now if we look at one of the<br>older studies in our<br>was lucky enough to be involved in this<br>lab where the study was done if you take<br>an animal model an animal model that is<br>HLA b27 positive so according to Simon<br>it's a it's a it's a predisposition to<br>develop ankylosing spondylitis if we<br>raise this animal model in in in in<br>germ-free conditions nothing will happen<br>this animal the the rat at this point<br>here this animal is very happy in the<br>germ-free condition and will not have<br>any any signs or symptoms however if<br>this animal is then raised on the<br>conventional conditions this this rat<br>will develop colitis in arthritis and<br>you see this here this is a heavily<br>inflamed colon with a vastly thickened<br>inner lining a vastly thickened MCOs are<br>lots of inflammatory cells in here Simon<br>tells me that this is a joint here and<br>it also looks inflamed because it has a<br>lot of pink in there which kind of<br>brings us to the end of my history<br>pathological knowledge but if you then<br>look at at these pores here they are<br>heavily inflamed and and thick and<br>coarse and this animal will drag their<br>hind feet behind them because they're<br>really painful but as I said this only<br>happens if this animal is in the<br>conventional condition so it's not<br>sterile is not in a germ-free condition<br>and this was like one of the first hints<br>that you need more than just a genetic<br>susceptibility to bring this disease to<br>the forefront now one of the<br>difficulties with studying the human<br>microbiome is obviously that the<br>technology is changing and this is why<br>we're finding more and more of of bugs<br>that might or might not be involved in<br>every week we will see a publication<br>somewhere that says we found the<br>bacterium the organism that explains<br>this on this disease in the past we<br>relied on culture techniques now we're<br>way past the cultural bacteria and we do<br>the Ion Torrent last sequence analysis<br>which tells us much more about about the<br>microbiome what's actually happening<br>there but not only the improvement in<br>technology will will be responsible for<br>that the microbiome is a very difficult<br>organism so to speak to study because<br>it's it's being affected by a lot of<br>factors not only the age so it will<br>change with age and then there will<br>this very long period where it's quite<br>stable until it changes again but also<br>what shapes the microbiome is genetics<br>is the route of births geography where<br>do we live<br>what kind of hygiene do we do we have<br>how many medications are we exposed to<br>all these kind of things will play a<br>role in the shape of our microbiome and<br>it's it can be used as a sort of<br>fingerprint the microbiome because<br>everybody has a different microbiome and<br>you can distinguish people on their<br>microbiome now taking that into account<br>and then trying to find out what's<br>different in certain diseases just it's<br>another layer to the complexity of all<br>that not to say it hasn't been done this<br>is a slide that shows you how different<br>the microbiome is in certain disorders<br>especially in inflammatory bowel disease<br>and if you look at those people down<br>here this is inflammatory bowel disease<br>patients the first two is normal<br>controls so there a lot of bacteria that<br>are expanded in these kind of conditions<br>and we talk more about a dysbiosis in<br>this in these disorders so not a<br>microbiome that looks similar to a<br>healthy person but more a microbiome<br>that has certain species expanded and<br>might play a role in the explanation of<br>this disease now Simon was involved in a<br>review article T once you comment on<br>this so we looked at literature this was<br>a couple of years ago now looking at<br>particular bacteria that have been<br>associated with spondyloarthritis and<br>quite a few have been identified over<br>time I think as we get a more complex<br>knowledge of the microbiome I think the<br>idea that specific species are involved<br>is rather too simplistic but certainly<br>some bacteria have interesting<br>properties which might make them more<br>prone to causing bowel inflammation and<br>act as triggers so these ones here for<br>instance sulfate-reducing bacteria have<br>a particular way of stimulating the<br>mucosa and causing inflammation by<br>release of toxic metabolites and that's<br>one of the things that<br>is really coming up this idea of<br>metabolomics so not only do we have to<br>know what bacteria are there but we have<br>to know what those bacteria are doing<br>and some of the studies in Crohn's<br>disease have really identified different<br>metabolomics signatures in different<br>patients so that's quite interesting we<br>sort of a few years ago now went along<br>the line of looking at how we might<br>maybe modified a microbiome to make it<br>less pro-inflammatory and we did a<br>groundbreaking study really with our<br>colleague Katie Jenks is on sabbatical<br>at the moment having a nice holiday in<br>Copenhagen but Katie did a study with<br>Michael and me for her master's and<br>looked at 63 patients and we divided<br>them into two groups and we gave them a<br>probiotic here this bliss with a range<br>of different healthy bacteria including<br>lactobacilli and we looked at a number<br>of outcome measures to see how great<br>this probiotic was going to be in curing<br>disease but unfortunately it had no<br>effect so sad face emoji for that it did<br>however strong placebo effects I had<br>patients coming to clinic probably use<br>well who begged us to continue in the<br>study because they were doing so much<br>better but you know how clinical trials<br>go there is an into everything and<br>specially if it's not working you you<br>don't really carry on luckily probiotics<br>are available over-the-counter the idea<br>that that patients with ankylosing<br>spondylitis or spondyloarthropathies in<br>that major have got inflammation and<br>looking at this gut information is<br>obviously not new this has been around<br>for a long time in this study here was<br>quite interesting it's an old study from<br>1988 in the British Journal of<br>Rheumatology so what these investigators<br>did is they looked at inflammatory guard<br>lesions in in a big number of<br>seronegative spondyloarthropathies<br>patients 232 to be exact in control and<br>in some control patients now in<br>rheumatoid arthritis 65% of those<br>patients had inflammatory guard lesions<br>ankylosing spondylitis patient's 57<br>mainly in patients with peripheral<br>or a few that I shall I be 27 positive<br>in the controls they studied they sorry<br>you're happy to board here I'm try to be<br>more interactive here in the controls<br>there were no patience with with any<br>lesions in there God so that kind of<br>showed already the high prevalence of of<br>these gut lesions in those patients and<br>Simon talked earlier on about the first<br>II relatives now there was a study in<br>1986 where patients with inflammatory<br>bowel disease where studied in their<br>first first-degree relatives as well as<br>spouses said lift with them and unlike<br>this study here in the inflammatory<br>bowel disease study the first-degree<br>relatives where were challenged with a<br>dose of aspirin because we know that<br>aspirin will disturb the intestinal<br>permeability so all of these<br>first-degree relatives showed a<br>heightened response to just one dose of<br>aspirin with their with the intestinal<br>permeability and in this study was then<br>in a way replicated here in patients<br>with ankylosing spondylitis just without<br>the aspirin and and three groups were<br>chosen patients with ankylosing<br>spondylitis firstly relatives since<br>their spouses had lived with them and<br>this was really to tease odd what's<br>genetic and what's the environmental<br>factor so to speak because they shared<br>the same environment now as expected HLA<br>b27 positive we're almost ninety percent<br>of all patients with ankylosing<br>spondylitis first-degree relatives still<br>57 percent we're positive and it wasn't<br>available in the spouses that this<br>wasn't measured but what they looked for<br>the the authors was the fecal<br>calprotectin now just honor on a sad<br>note fecal calprotectin is a stool<br>marker that we can measure and it's<br>basically the product of inflammation in<br>the intestine it's a very sensitive<br>marker for intestinal inflammation not<br>very specific to where the information<br>comes from so I always tell my patients<br>you know you can bite your tongue and<br>that gets inflamed and then you poop it<br>out the other end and I will find a race<br>fecal calprotectin doesn't tell me<br>whether your large intestine your small<br>intestine or even higher up is inflamed<br>so the fecal calprotectin was measured<br>in those<br>three patient groups and it was<br>significantly elevated in patients with<br>ankylosing spondylitis so that was<br>certainly a surprise but what was even<br>more surprises that it was also<br>significantly elevated in patients in<br>first relatives who we are patients<br>those people didn't have an callosum<br>spondylitis so that was quite remarkable<br>the spouses didn't have an elevation of<br>their fecal calprotectin so that was<br>interesting what became then more<br>interesting was that there was this high<br>prevalence of subclinical intestinal<br>inflammation because all of these<br>patients didn't complain of any symptoms<br>but it was irrespective of the HLA<br>genotype in those patients so obviously<br>the intestinal information I think some<br>of the things we talked about early on<br>Simon did indicate that possibly the gut<br>inflammation is something separate to<br>the joint inflammation the frequency of<br>the intestine information was similar to<br>that frequency that we saw in that<br>Crohn's disease study with the<br>first-degree relatives so that's quite<br>interesting and now this leads us over<br>to studies again another study that<br>we've done here in you know targa where<br>we really looked at the clinical<br>presentation of those patients with<br>ankylosing spondylitis you know how much<br>gut information they have yes thank you<br>Michael so what we wanted to do was to<br>see if there were non-invasive ways<br>where we could identify patients who had<br>asymptomatic bowel inflammation who<br>might go on to develop Crohn's disease<br>or more Evert bowel inflammation Hmong<br>star cohort of patients with<br>spondyloarthritis so in order to do that<br>we adapted a questionnaire called the<br>Dudley inflammatory bowel symptom<br>questionnaire from use in bowel<br>inflammation to our spondyloarthritis<br>cohort and we looked at this initially<br>in around 75 spondyloarthritis patients<br>and compared that with controls healthy<br>controls and people with crohn's disease<br>and the interesting thing you can see<br>here is that patients who were healthy<br>and healthy controls have very low<br>levels of bowel symptoms this is a score<br>out of 60 on a questionnaire but<br>patients with spondyloarthritis had<br>significantly more bowel symptoms<br>and the healthy controls but in turn<br>significantly less symptoms than<br>patients with Crohn's disease so a kind<br>of intermediate group and if we looked<br>at this in terms of disease activity<br>obviously patients with Crohn's disease<br>are going to have more bowel symptoms<br>when their Crohn's is more active than<br>when it's in remission but similarly<br>patients with ankylosing spondylitis<br>when they had active disease they had<br>more bowel symptoms than when they were<br>in remission so perhaps there's a link<br>between inflammation and these bowel<br>symptoms more recently we looked at<br>scores over five years in patients with<br>ankylosing spondylitis throughout New<br>Zealand this is a cohort of around 365<br>patients throughout it's Zealand studied<br>over five years and over this period you<br>can see a remarkably stable level of<br>bowel symptoms over that time which<br>seems to be unaffected by treatment over<br>that time which is quite interesting if<br>all these patients been exposed to a<br>gastroenterologist yeah that's fine<br>you'd have a lot of extra work to do so<br>this is another thing you might say well<br>bowel symptoms you know could be a<br>number of reasons for that but if we if<br>we look at the famous Bristol stool<br>chart here which hopefully you all have<br>on the back of your door so that you can<br>look in the toilet and see what bowel<br>motions you have that day whether it's<br>sort of what is it<br>sausage shaped with lumps or or fluffy<br>with edges on it so these last two here<br>type 6 and 7 on the Bristol stool chart<br>has sort of diarrheal type presentations<br>of your stool and again we can see that<br>if we look at that with patient group<br>they have significantly more loose bowel<br>motions than the healthy controls but<br>significantly less than Crohn's so again<br>they fall into that intermediate group<br>what does that all mean the question was<br>then posed the symptoms the fluffy bowel<br>motions they get is that all something<br>that points to some disease some illness<br>some pathogenesis that we can find so we<br>took it a step further and we examined<br>those patients small intestine so if you<br>just look very carefully you could say<br>something about we need to press this<br>here we've got help on the way our<br>multimedia doesn't work ah there we go<br>so if we look very careful at this this<br>is a capsule endoscopy movie and you see<br>the small intestine rushing by here<br>there was an ulcer there's a mouth<br>another one yes it's excitement this is<br>really primetime Netflix there's another<br>outside of the year so this is what a<br>capsule endoscopy look like there's just<br>another ulcer passed by here so this is<br>capsule endoscopy as I said before a<br>little capsule that these patients are<br>swallowing that sends pictures every few<br>seconds from the small intestine to your<br>receiver and then we look at at this bit<br>more subtle on this side here there is<br>something at seven o'clock coming by<br>just been past there was one another one<br>you just have to believe me they are<br>nice looking ulcers here which makes the<br>day of every gastroenterologist if we<br>just suffered through about two hours of<br>normal small intestine and then come<br>into the terminal ileum and finally find<br>these ulcers this this is a study and<br>the next picture will show you that this<br>is a study on patients with<br>spondyloarthritis all these patients<br>that had increased frequency of their<br>bowel habits and and some abnormal<br>stools so what this picture here is<br>showing you is really just the findings<br>on the smaller<br>and if I go one further this is a<br>collection of data and things to<br>Africana our registrar who's been<br>through these 16 patients again and<br>interesting findings and we have to<br>admit we haven't yet had much time to<br>think about this very much when you<br>remember what simon said early on that<br>obviously the bowel symptoms went along<br>with the arthritis symptoms this came<br>through here as well so we have again<br>the DI skew sheet here or I should use<br>turn it back on thank you so if we we<br>have the DI skew here again so the they<br>got symptoms and we have on this side<br>here we have the colitis symptoms where<br>am I here that we have the arthritis<br>symptoms so with increasing symptoms of<br>arthritis so increase the gut symptoms<br>not much correlation with the fecal<br>calprotectin this intestinal<br>inflammatory marker also I don't think a<br>lot of correlation with what we find on<br>capsule endoscopy colonoscopy and all of<br>these patients was surprisingly normal a<br>little bit colitis here after then<br>provided us over this slide which might<br>be clinically relevant for all of us so<br>if we find patient with a CRP of growth<br>greater than 10 or a fecal calprotectin<br>of greater than a hundred the likelihood<br>of finding small intestinal lesions goes<br>up with these increased inflammatory<br>markers so maybe and this is something<br>that we're going to talk in them in the<br>last few minutes maybe this is a very<br>crude way of identifying patients where<br>we need to look a little bit further for<br>these small intestinal lesions in<br>finally small international intestinal<br>lesions or patients that are prone to it<br>current treatment options can be treat<br>the spectrum can we go away from the<br>silo mentality of just treating either<br>yes maybe there are treatments which<br>really make differentiating who has<br>these problems irrelevant because we can<br>treat them all with one-size-fits-all<br>therapy so this is a little mixed<br>message really here so if we look at<br>treatments which we commonly use for<br>both conditions there's a sort of mixed<br>bag of results so often one of the first<br>biologic therapies that we use in people<br>who've got severe ankylosing spondylitis<br>or who have inflammatory bowel disease<br>particularly crohn's which is severe<br>would be to use anti-tnf therapy is<br>monoclonal antibodies so and this is a<br>study which the only study really which<br>has looked at the co-existence of these<br>two and inflammatory bowel disease and<br>spondyloarthritis to see what the effect<br>of treatment is so if we look at<br>infliximab which is kind of a standard<br>biologic present for managing crohn's<br>disease we can see that the number of<br>Crohn's disease flares in a group of<br>patients who have predominant<br>spondyloarthritis Falls dramatically in<br>this group so this is really treating<br>both groups of patients very well if we<br>look at other common anti-tnf therapy is<br>used in ankylosing spondylitis really no<br>more effective than placebo in reducing<br>those instances of inflammatory bowel<br>disease so from that point of view alone<br>we'd certainly perhaps be better<br>thinking about using infliximab in these<br>patients in terms of ankylosing<br>spondylitis Thomas Jefferson really sum<br>this up very well we hold these truths<br>to be self-evident this is July the 4th<br>so I thought we'd better have<br>Declaration of Independence we hold<br>these truths to be self-evident that all<br>TNF inhibitors are created equal so if<br>you look at the various ones which are<br>used in ankylosing spondylitis all just<br>as effective for the articular<br>manifestations of unclosing spondylitis<br>as each other but clearly this is not<br>the case<br>when it comes to inflammatory bowel<br>disease and another difference in<br>ankylosing spondylitis is that we need<br>to keep patients on treatment forever<br>once you stop this is the cumulative<br>probability of a flare so very expensive<br>we have to keep people with enclosing<br>spondylitis on their biologic drugs<br>forever which is somewhat different to<br>your situation<br>yes but the world moves on into despite<br>living in New Zealand with having farm<br>act that restricts our use of<br>medications quite a lot there are lots<br>of medications that are currently in the<br>pipeline so it will be obviously<br>interesting will our knowledge now of<br>the genetics of the immune system<br>abnormality is the microbiome will this<br>knowledge translate into a therapy a<br>treatment that will hopefully treat both<br>of these agents now Simon has already<br>talked about the anti tumor necrosis<br>factor agents infliximab and all the<br>others most of them or the first two at<br>least are available in New Zealand and<br>as Simon pointed out at least and<br>there's one study it looked like<br>infliximab is the drug of choice it's<br>not quite clear why that would be<br>certainly from a gas for a logical point<br>of view attorney said doesn't work in<br>inflammatory bowel disease at the limo<br>mark works very well in inflammatory<br>bowel disease so why infliximab then<br>would work on both is is a little bit<br>difficult to grasp for for<br>Gastroenterological disorders we have<br>these anti integrants now these are<br>these are in medications that stop<br>inflammatory cells from entering the gut<br>so we don't think that those have much<br>of a future in treating both of these<br>conditions they are very specific for<br>for gut inflammatory bowel disease so I<br>don't think those two drugs are anywhere<br>in the future more interesting is is<br>anti aisle 12 file 23 and there is a<br>drug that is already on the market by<br>the name of still ARA it will hopefully<br>come to our toe to chew gastroenterology<br>as well but I think it's already in in<br>rheumatology no no not yet<br>oh sorry it is it is in Australia but I<br>think that's that's a drug that holds a<br>promise when we look at the coming<br>results the edge<br>Kinya Bishan also I think it's very<br>early to know whether these trucks will<br>treat both of these conditions or just<br>one but there is another drug say kooky<br>new map they all getting more and more<br>difficult to pronounce say kooky no map<br>anti aisle 17 which has so far been<br>disappointing in gastroenterology is it<br>different in rheumatology very<br>successful there you go this is getting<br>more and more difficult so just on a<br>second last slide here on the induced<br>economic or still ara very affective<br>truck in in Crohn's disease with high<br>response rates and mind you patients<br>that nowadays goes in to go into these<br>trials our patients that usually have<br>failed a lot of other medications<br>they're usually at the end of their<br>Tator with what's what's already on the<br>market so they are very difficult<br>patients but a 35 percent response rate<br>at week six is fantastic for those<br>patients for the two percent remission<br>rate at week twenty two is even better<br>so so this this drug is really something<br>that we are looking forward to and we<br>hope we get this our hands on in in the<br>near future<br>now there's one anecdote on that before<br>I pass it on to Simon again we had one<br>patient on this trial a patient with<br>psoriasis IND inflammatory bowel disease<br>unfortunately in that patient the drug<br>didn't work in inflammatory bowel<br>disease but it beautifully cleared this<br>patients psoriasis so from a quality of<br>life standpoint this patient was perfect<br>she showed me her legs which not many<br>patients do but she showed me her legs<br>and said Michael for the first time in<br>years I was able to shave my legs again<br>which for her was probably more<br>important then she still was running<br>through the traffic quite often some<br>studies coming up to be published on<br>Easter Kinney map in ankylosing<br>spondylitis unfortunately have been<br>somewhat disappointing in that condition<br>although very effective in psoriatic<br>arthritis interesting drug which we<br>would expect to be helpful not<br>necessarily so so just to summarize<br>really at the end what is the future for<br>this overlap between spondyloarthritis<br>and inflammatory bowel disease I think<br>what we need to do is to continue<br>working to find clinical and laboratory<br>factors which are going to help us to<br>identify patients who are going to be at<br>risk of significant problems in either<br>direction really that Co risk then we<br>need to perhaps try and elucidate the<br>complex interaction between genetics the<br>microbiome pro-inflammatory metabolomics<br>the gut and joint immune system a very<br>complex web of interrelated aspects and<br>maybe microbial profiling in the future<br>will be helpful we need to think a<br>little bit about what targeted therapies<br>will mean it's been a bit disappointing<br>that beyond certain TNF inhibitors we<br>don't seem to have a one-size-fits-all<br>drug at present but there are things<br>these jak stat inhibitors in particular<br>perhaps hold the biggest likelihood of<br>thank you thank you Simon the first<br>question and then go to people in the<br>audience one thing you didn't mention<br>that seems obvious as I was thinking<br>about that was when you've gotten<br>arthritis you get a whole lot of drugs<br>that hops up to the gut so how does that<br>interact with the discussion that yes/no<br>berry you you hit the nail on the head<br>they had this it was on one of the<br>slides but I glanced over that this does<br>make studying these patients very<br>difficult because obviously just taking<br>a picture from the small intestine<br>findings small answers doesn't give you<br>a diagnosis and and those small answers<br>could well be the result of of the<br>nonsteroidals I used this against Simon<br>and said well you know you do trying<br>very hard to give these patients that<br>symptoms so we can finally treat them<br>yes and about a third of patients who<br>take anti-inflammatories will develop<br>some form of ulceration and it's<br>actually missed I think a lot in the<br>general appreciation of what<br>nonsteroidals do for whatever reason<br>they're taken this very high instance of<br>ulceration caused in the lower gas but<br>it may be that being a bit cleverer<br>about how we use anti-inflammatories can<br>can modulate that so combining with<br>misoprostol a an inhibitor of<br>cyclooxygenase and also using celecoxib<br>the cox hips these are both shown to the<br>ways of reducing that burden<br>inflammation in the lower GI tract talk<br>talking about quality of life I think<br>which comes in there Simon that all of<br>those patients all of our 16 patients<br>they dwell on these drugs were reluctant<br>to stop them because obviously we talked<br>to them about that and said can you stop<br>them for four weeks so we have a true<br>reading off you got they were all not<br>happy about that because they basically<br>said we can't function without these<br>drugs smelko on top inflammatory bowel<br>disease and where it occurs you know in<br>places that have supermarkets that's<br>what you were attributing it to but<br>though as you pointed out there was a<br>lack at the equator so how do you<br>distinguish that between being a<br>latitudinal effect and being an effect<br>of being on a supermarket diet not I<br>it's hard to distinguish there are many<br>many factors that play into this<br>north-south gradient or south-north<br>gradient John and and one of the stories<br>was also exposure to sunlight is it is<br>it the vitamin B stadi story that plays<br>a role in the<br>that there is more exposure to sunlight<br>we know that inflammatory bowel disease<br>is less likely in patients who are more<br>exposed to sunlight than in other<br>patients so yes I agree with you there<br>are so many factors that might not have<br>it's 5-2 so time for us to get to the<br>next session so I look forward to seeing</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
