Sharon leach here<br>the Sharon's a general practitioner and<br>also there's a member of the department<br>of general practice and rural health<br>she's currently studying for a PhD in<br>patient safety and she's going to be<br>talking tonight about loneliness and the<br>elderly and we also have Fela Perico and<br>Philip has an occupational therapist<br>from the DHB and part of her role she's<br>a specialist in accessing and helping<br>staff to access that enter ie<br>data and also clinical needs assessments<br>and she's also going to be um assisting<br>with this current topic we'll then move<br>on to associate professor Deborah waters<br>and Deborah's from the department of<br>medicine in physiotherapy and she's the<br>director of gerontology and research and<br>she's going to be talking tonight about<br>the loss of skill muscle mass in<br>function and elderly and then finally<br>we're going to hear from associate<br>professor your own barek um and he is a<br>associate professor and psycho<br>geriatrics and he's going to be talking<br>about brain health literacy so an<br>interesting series of topics that we're<br>going to discuss tonight and of course<br>at the end we'll have time for questions<br>so get ready to ask some interesting<br>questions thank you very much it's<br>fantastic thank you very much for your<br>introductions and it's my very great<br>pleasure to be here with you this<br>evening thank you so much for coming<br>along and I hope you have an enjoyable<br>in informative evening so tonight I am<br>Super Ages IND their superpowers I hope<br>you're not going to be too disappointed<br>because I don't actually have a lights<br>over here with me but I hope that by the<br>end of this talk you will understand a<br>little bit about our project that we've<br>been doing<br>comparing psychosocial variables<br>associated with loneliness among<br>centenarians in the elderly so I've been<br>doing this research with Philippa greco<br>together with Paul glue and Yoram Barak<br>from the department of psychological<br>medicine in indu grave from the<br>biostatistics unit so in this talk we<br>will tell you a bit about our project<br>with the dadoes come from the entire<br>data set who's involved in the study the<br>demographic variables and psychosocial<br>variables that we looked at and of<br>course what we learnt from looking at<br>that data so first of all one of the key<br>things that we were interested in was<br>loneliness you might think this is a<br>strange thing to pick up on but you know<br>after your basic very basic needs are<br>met everyone has a deep need for a sense<br>of belonging and connectedness in the<br>lake of those things has been shown to<br>be very detrimental a wide range of<br>studies have now clearly shown that<br>loneliness is associated with reduced<br>quality of life reduced health and<br>increased morbidity in premature<br>mortality then short loneliness is very<br>very bad for your health<br>and if we can think of any ways to<br>address that problem it would be<br>wonderful the other thing that we we<br>were interested in was centenarians<br>these are a really very interesting<br>group of people the few survived to 100<br>years of age you can be defined as a<br>model of successful aging and we thought<br>that by examining their psychosocial<br>variables we may<br>to fire some vectors which promote<br>so we obtained the data used in this<br>study from our enter a assessments enter<br>I stands for international resident<br>assessment instruments it's the term<br>that refers to both the suite of<br>assessments that we use in the<br>organization that developed the<br>assessments the organization at all came<br>from the US and in the 1980s we they<br>were looking at trying to improve the<br>quality of care and nursing homes so<br>that's where we get the word resident is<br>now a suite of assessments available for<br>people in all different settings enter I<br>assessments they are comprehensive<br>clinical assessments the one that we<br>used has 236 items and they focus on a<br>person's function across all areas of<br>their daily life and the assessments are<br>specially designed to identify where a<br>person has opportunities where we can<br>help them improve their function and<br>also where there are risks to their<br>health so it highlights those areas for<br>us we use the assessment information to<br>develop a plan which you know we do in<br>conduct conjunction with the person and<br>their family and that plan focuses on<br>achieving goals in meeting their needs<br>in New Zealand an entry assessment is<br>mandatory for people to be able to<br>access funded age-related services and<br>so that's a drill ated services in the<br>community and also age was a teacher<br>here so in terms of the data we used<br>they were from assessments completed<br>throughout New Zealand so the whole of<br>New Zealand uses this assessment and<br>they were all people living in the<br>community so it's not from people living<br>in rest homes or residential care and<br>they were having their first enter a<br>home care assessment in southern dhb<br>those receiving a high<br>peer assessment are deemed clinically<br>complex which means they have a<br>significant cognitive impairment or<br>functional impairment there'll be a<br>reason why we considered complex in most<br>most District Health Boards around New<br>Zealand use the same model and in terms<br>of the way they use their assessments so<br>we had two groups of clients that we<br>looked at or the participants were two<br>groups those aged 65 to 99 so just over<br>73,000 worth and our centenarians of<br>which we had 191 and the variables<br>included were age gender ethnicity who<br>they proven lived with their marital<br>status whether or not they had a<br>close-in supportive relationship with<br>their family whether they reported that<br>all said that they were lonely and the<br>last one was people who were at risk<br>whether they were at risk or currently<br>so let's now focus a little bit on the<br>data that we collected so this graph<br>shows the age age range of participants<br>in our study who ranged from 65 years<br>old it was our lower cutoff right up to<br>109 years old you can see that as you<br>get older you're getting more complex<br>and more frail and therefore more likely<br>to have a entire assessment and then if<br>you know natural aging kicks in and<br>people pass away the actual numbers and<br>those groups that become very small as<br>well the mean age in our elderly group<br>was 81 years in four centenarians it was<br>20 years older at 101 years of age we<br>looked at some very basic demographic<br>details into the predominant mostly<br>there were women in our sample<br>of the elderly group 57 percent were<br>female and they increased to 71 percent<br>of centenarians there were no<br>significant differences between the<br>groups in terms of the ethnicity<br>breakdown but they were predominantly<br>European in of that I'm sure most the<br>New Zealand European among the elderly<br>they were 86 percent who were European<br>and they increased to 93 percent of<br>centenarians so we when you're thinking<br>about loneliness one of the things that<br>you automatically think of is how<br>socially connected at someone might be<br>and so we looked at some variables that<br>might reflect this so firstly we looked<br>at marital status and I hope you can see<br>the differences in color there on the<br>graph but the orange bars are the<br>elderly and the green bars of the<br>centenarians make this work and so we've<br>got in this group the never marriage and<br>these people are either married or in a<br>de facto relationship the widowed<br>divorced in other and you can see that<br>the elderly group her roughly 50/50<br>split between married in widowed however<br>when it comes to the centenarians only<br>six percent were married and almost 90<br>percent were widowed this is reflected<br>in the nature of the living arrangements<br>of the people in our study so this group<br>here with living with a spouse or<br>partner is pretty much the same as this<br>group of married people but you can see<br>that centenarians by far<br>almost all either living alone or living<br>with relatives and out of that group<br>with relatives<br>that's almost predominantly with living<br>with their children whereas the elderly<br>are a bit more widely spread across<br>those categories in terms of family<br>support I was really pleased to see that<br>these numbers look like<br>of the elderly group 89% felt that they<br>had good support from their family and<br>their increased to 94% of centenarians<br>so there was a just a significant<br>difference between those two groups how<br>does this relate to loneliness overall<br>we found that aging was associated with<br>decreasing loneliness and you can see<br>this as reflected in this graph so on<br>average loneliness decreed decreased<br>from about 20% down to about 16% and<br>most of that was accounted for by the<br>female decreasing loneliness over time<br>whereas the males was decreased a little<br>bit but not significantly snuck so and I<br>guess we could hypothesize that perhaps<br>the males that equally indifferent that<br>whatever age the people around them that<br>I couldn't possibly speculate as to<br>whether that's true or not the last<br>thing we looked at was depression and<br>this is really important in terms of if<br>you're feeling depressed you have much<br>less likely to go out and socialize and<br>it might increase your feelings of<br>loneliness<br>the first bar here is not depressed at<br>all these people have mild to moderate<br>depression and this little group down<br>here is moderate to severe depression in<br>centenarians on the whole were a lot<br>less depressed then the elderly and this<br>might not be quite so easy to see but<br>this is we looked at whether depression<br>was associated with loneliness at all<br>this scale along the bottom goes is<br>showing the severity of depression from<br>not depressed at all to very severely<br>depressed and the orange bars represent<br>the proportion of people who are lonely<br>in that group and over time is the if<br>the depression worsens the proportion of<br>people reporting loneliness<br>in Christ so in summary what what were<br>the super powers of our super ages I get<br>I'm afraid um they aren't really super<br>powers but it was a very catchy title<br>that I wanted to go so compared to at<br>the elderly our super ages were mostly<br>European women who were widowed they<br>were either living alone or with<br>relatives they had more family support<br>they felt less lonely in they were less<br>depressed and when we have looked at the<br>international literature and in this<br>area we found that our New Zealand<br>centenarians were actually a lot less<br>lonely in less depressed than has been<br>reported internationally so that's very<br>interesting findings and I hope that<br>having identified these things we can<br>actually put some things into place<br>which will help continue to improve<br>feelings of connectedness in community<br>within both the elderly and centenarian<br>groups perhaps by treating depression<br>more actively or preventing depression<br>in considering what might be the best<br>ways of living together in a community<br>as we age so thank you very much for<br>your time and for your attention and I<br>think of your questions and we'll<br>revisit us at the end of the<br>presentation<br>right thank you very much for coming<br>along this evening and um I kind of<br>changed direction here a little bit and<br>talked to you about something and<br>hopefully it doesn't depress you when I<br>talk about what I'm gonna talk about<br>initially because it is kind of like on<br>that's all it's kind of doom and gloom<br>kind of information but I'll be covering<br>a lot of different different kind of<br>research from different groups and then<br>I'll go into a little bit of the<br>research that I've done myself with some<br>of my colleagues in the u.s. so there we<br>go<br>so what's happening as we age is called<br>sarcopenia and that's the lost skeletal<br>muscle mass and function it used to be<br>that we just define it as the loss of<br>skeletal muscle mass as you'll see in<br>that slide on your left so when you hit<br>your peak at 25 but you start the slow<br>trajectory downwards and if you lose<br>live long enough if you've just seen an<br>ad and you've lost 70% of your lean body<br>mass your skeletal muscle mass you're a<br>very high risk of death and the thing<br>that goes hand-in-hand with this is also<br>strength so even you know people who are<br>doing clean-and-jerk which is a big<br>power lifting movement and we're world<br>weight lifters actually they continue to<br>lose weight strength as they aged as<br>well and this is actually it's hard to<br>read but this is out to age 65 and even<br>Arnold is not immune from the changes of<br>body composition and he was quite<br>muscular and worked very hard and<br>someone who wasn't always natural but<br>his body composition has changed quite<br>dramatically as well so these are<br>changes that happen but there are the<br>good news be the good news story when I<br>get further into the talk is you can do<br>things about this reversing this trend<br>the other thing that is happening his<br>obesity is rising and this is in the<br>news today I was listening to it as I<br>was driving it to work and it said<br>obesity otago research and this is a<br>different group here at Otago alarming<br>rise of obesity in New Zealand and this<br>is using something called the body mass<br>index or BMI so that your weight divided<br>by your height squared so you get a<br>relative measure of your body mass and<br>that's the news quite widely in<br>population-based research and it's a<br>good measure when you're young and this<br>is a wide age range that they were<br>looking at and<br>in 2013 there was a news article that<br>came out and stopped saying we've got a<br>crisis of obesity in our elderly and<br>we'd already seen this has been going on<br>they've been tracking this since the 70s<br>in the u.s. that's happening in Europe<br>and it's happening Australia and has<br>arrived here<br>so we also have a rising number of<br>people who are obese going into old age<br>because what is happening is we've got<br>this as I've just described you've got<br>this body fat which is increasing all<br>the way out into our 80s and Beyond and<br>some people but at the same time you've<br>got a decrease in your lean body mass<br>your skeletal muscle mass and your bone<br>ok so everything that's not fat so<br>that's decreasing as the age and the<br>weight is can stay pretty stable and BMI<br>can stay pretty stable so we get a peak<br>in this body fat in our middle age<br>really later than most people think it's<br>between the ages of 55 to 65 but when<br>you've got these two tissues fat<br>weighing less than muscle on a scale it<br>really masks what's going on if you just<br>put someone on a scale and weigh them<br>don't tell you at all as an older person<br>what's really happening with their body<br>composition so this slide shows you<br>using that measure of BMI talked about a<br>moment ago that this is the percentage<br>of people with normal BMI which is in<br>their age of 18 to 25 when you're in<br>your ages of 20 to 25 will pass to 60%<br>of the Parker sent of people have normal<br>BMI that study believed declines and<br>then you can see it steadily starts<br>rising and normalizing is that real<br>probably not because of this BMI is not<br>really picking very good at all in<br>picking up these changes in body<br>composition the other not so good news<br>but those of us who are in these age<br>ranges will probably attest to this is<br>our waist circumference keeps increasing<br>well into old age ok so a part of it is<br>that we have a shift in where fat fat is<br>stored in the body not so much in the<br>arms and legs and not so much in the<br>face but it goes into the abdominal<br>cavity so that's the other thing that's<br>happening as well see is it well this is<br>really a depressing talk when she goes<br>up but this is what it looks like so<br>this is an MRI image of a thigh so if<br>you took cross-sectional<br>straight down your leg you would be<br>looking at a muscle group in the front<br>of your leg and then that's the back of<br>the leg the muscle and this is how much<br>adipose tissue is in a person who is<br>what we call skinny fat or sarcopenia<br>and obese so when you weigh this person<br>or you do a BMI you may not this up<br>surprising as that sounds it's true and<br>if you look at this muscle you can also<br>see it doesn't look very normal and the<br>more obese a person is the more abnormal<br>that muscle looks because the fat starts<br>infiltrating muscle fibers and getting<br>in between the muscle cells and doing<br>all sorts of untoward things - the way<br>the muscle would normally look and<br>function so that's the circle pinochle<br>piece the skinny fat and I started with<br>the title of this talk now this is some<br>data that we had from a study that I did<br>here which was a baseline DEXA scans<br>because dual energy x-ray absorptiometry<br>is one of the tools that we use to<br>measure this and you can see across the<br>top there we really have four different<br>groups so we have people who and these<br>are all men these are the males of this<br>group who are in there anywhere from 70<br>to 80 s and get more older you're more<br>likely to be circa P neck but you can<br>see we have people who have pretty<br>normal lean body mass pretty normal fat<br>we have people who have low lean body<br>mass market panic but they have pretty<br>low fat we have people who have low lean<br>body mass and high fat which is a group<br>I'm interested in and we have people who<br>have high fat but pretty normal lean<br>body mass so what this is kind of what<br>you see in people but to bring back the<br>point of what I was saying about weight<br>and BMI if you look at the men who are<br>normal and circle pinochle beasts their<br>weight was the same their BMI was the<br>same so if they wanted to see their<br>doctor their GP and they put them on a<br>scale I say huh you're right<br>everything's fine you're way normal your<br>BMI z' looks good but if you look at<br>their lean body mass very different and<br>of course a percentage pad very<br>different so you're probably asking<br>yourself well why do I care what<br>difference does it make if I have this<br>body composition the reason you would<br>care is because it has implications for<br>function okay so this is the same study<br>that I just showed you but this has been<br>replicated again and again began<br>it started in the States brought it here<br>we've seen it all over Europe and the<br>other groups are in this area<br>so we actually did some functional tests<br>on that same group of people this is the<br>males and females together and we have<br>the normal the SAR kapeniak the soccer<br>pinochle beasts and obese and for every<br>test that we tested they had poor<br>performance even worse the people who<br>are obese because the people who are<br>obese had normally in body mess so when<br>we did the chair sit to stand three<br>times and much fewer significantly fewer<br>we did a step touch which is just a<br>dynamic balance test they did fewer step<br>touches and when they did a timed up and<br>going walked around a cone they were<br>slower than the other groups and this as<br>I said has been replicated in many other<br>studies and so we know that this<br>particular body composition phenotype<br>does make people or does is associated<br>with this poor function so that is a<br>problem because function also decreases<br>as I said before with age so let's get<br>to the good news story okay what can we<br>do about this I had the privilege and<br>still do work with dr. Villarreal in the<br>US and he's been doing research and he<br>doesn't call it necessarily sarcopenia<br>khabees but he calls him frail and obese<br>but we when we get in and look at these<br>people they really are sarcopenia<br>Canobie so all of his studies start out<br>kind of the same way with using BMI even<br>though we know it no it's not a perfect<br>measure but it's an easy measure to get<br>for screening or aged over 65 their<br>sedentary stable weight stable<br>medications they get excluded if they<br>had any health kind of problems that<br>would exclude them from it put them at<br>risk for exercising and then where he<br>picks up the frailty as he does what's<br>called a physical form it's test it's a<br>battery of tests and you get asked range<br>of scores and the perfect score is about<br>36 and a vo2 peak which is actually<br>measuring your cardio respiratory health<br>on a treadmill so that's how he knows<br>people are frail and he knows people are<br>obese so in his different studies and<br>this is one of the one of the studies<br>that he did earlier on and then we've<br>replicated this more recently with a<br>slightly different study design but<br>they're usually set up in the same way<br>we have four groups and they get<br>randomized into these groups so we have<br>people who go into the healthy lifestyle<br>just get education know<br>kind of intervention there the control<br>group we have a group that goes through<br>just weight loss so they went through<br>diet counseling nutritional counseling<br>coming in every week and going through<br>their what they've been eating with<br>account with a dietitian they were<br>actually actively decreasing their<br>dietary intake by 500 to 750<br>kilocalories per day everyone got<br>calcium in vitamin D supplements the<br>exercising group did a combined aerobic<br>resistance program three times a week<br>and a clinic gym it was really<br>reasonably high intensity and they did<br>that over this 52 weeks and the group<br>that was doing weight loss plus exercise<br>was doing that diet and also doing the<br>aerobic and resistance exercise together<br>so this shows you what happened the<br>control group in the exercise group by<br>design didn't lose any weight and the<br>dieting group and the diet and exercise<br>lost ten percent of their body weight<br>over that intervention period so and<br>when we got this funded by the National<br>Institutes of Health they said you are<br>never going to change people's behavior<br>sixty five-plus sedentary obese<br>sprayable good luck<br>but we've proved them wrong you can and<br>so when we look at this more closely<br>because the the big concern with this<br>kind of study was that they were worried<br>that you're losing that lean body mass<br>you're losing bone you're increasing fat<br>as you age what happens when you start<br>accelerating those tissues to change and<br>so what we found was that the people who<br>are just doing weight loss dieting alone<br>no exercise they went this was one<br>person went from 95 kg to 75 kg good<br>result<br>they were frail moderately fail they<br>maxed out the tests almost when they<br>came back it's the same person who would<br>hardly know it 30% loss of they're in<br>fact they lost 10% knee and body mass<br>hikes not really what we really wanted<br>to see so when we looked at people who<br>are exercising plus losing weight this<br>is again the same person doesn't look as<br>much weight loss but because they gained<br>4% of lean body mass which weighs more<br>than fat and they lost 18% fat they went<br>from being pretty frail to again almost<br>maxing out the chest so that's better<br>better result the other thing we looked<br>at was bone because bone is another<br>tissue<br>that you have to worry about as you age<br>and what we found again was this dieting<br>group this is change in hip bone mineral<br>density over that time after the<br>intervention ended the grip that it was<br>dieting alone lost almost two percent of<br>their bone marrow density in their hip<br>people who are dieting and exercise is<br>still lost a little but it was it seemed<br>to be mitigated and this is just a<br>marker of bone turnover which shows you<br>how high had gotten the people who are<br>dieting alone<br>the last thing over there were many<br>other things we looked at but one other<br>thing that we looked at was looking at<br>strength balance and gait speed and you<br>can see that the exercise and diet group<br>looked pretty reasonably similar but<br>what we found when we repeated this<br>study and had people doing just<br>resistance just aerobic or ordering a<br>combination the two and all the newer<br>dieting we found this combination of of<br>both resistance and aerobic exercise the<br>superior for changes in function<br>compared to just doing one at one<br>modality by itself so that was an<br>interesting finding it was certainly<br>interesting finding finding out about<br>dieting and its effect on body<br>composition so in short you can see that<br>we probably are going to be seeing<br>increases of the numbers of people who<br>are sarcopenia can peace in this<br>population in New Zealand and across the<br>world and the reason that is is because<br>obesity is increasing in prevalence<br>people are living longer there's more<br>sedentary behavior but this can be<br>reversed okay it's clinically difficult<br>to identify but what we're doing now is<br>using this BMI in clinics and also<br>you're looking at functional measures to<br>try to see if there's a way in which we<br>can pick up people who are sertapedic<br>and possibly sertapedic<br>obese and get them into some<br>interventions that we know are safe and<br>effective so this combined weight loss<br>and exercise provided a greater<br>functional improvements than the<br>individual interventions that we know<br>now that this exercise and older people<br>should be combined of a resistance plus<br>aerobic training which is something we<br>didn't expect necessarily and we also<br>now can say pretty emphatically that we<br>know that just telling people who are<br>even obese or sarcopenia cookies to just<br>diet is not really going to be good for<br>their bone health and their lean body<br>mess<br>and to end on how things can look better<br>there's one there's what can happen when<br>you really stay on top of it and what<br>like<br>Hey so for those of us survived and made<br>it so far<br>yeah I'm associate professor Bach and<br>I'll be talking about a what we feel the<br>Department of psychological medicine<br>where I'm pointed to be one of the novel<br>ways to try and help with preventing<br>Alzheimer's disease so preliminary<br>results heal and promise for more<br>results in a year's time so we really<br>should you know be here inhales time<br>looking at what we've been achieving<br>yeah apologies for my accent if anything<br>is unclear please stop me and I'll try<br>to clarify that we are looking at the<br>department of psychological medicine and<br>these are my collaborators of station<br>the wonderful andrew gray and dr.<br>Charlie Nazi and the epidemiologist<br>actually world renown professor Kate<br>Scott and and we are looking to see what<br>people are aware of about their brain<br>hand what do actually people know or<br>unfortunately are misinformed about<br>brain health and and you get a lot of<br>funny answers when you ask people about<br>what's good for your brain some people<br>think of something that smoking is<br>really good for attention because it<br>helps with concentrating and nicotine is<br>good for your brain of course completely<br>wrong but people would tend to think<br>that Oh some people think that different<br>dietary styles are good for their brain<br>people are really happy with dairy<br>products or battle which are actually<br>sort of a sign light for the brain so<br>there's a lot of misinformation lot of<br>good information out there but if we<br>want to help people make a change in<br>their lifestyle we really are trying to<br>personalize the information packages<br>according to what people really know<br>about their brain health<br>so in essence that's what we are doing<br>and and why do we need to do that<br>well the total number of people will<br>dementia will increase tremendously not<br>only because of the aging of the<br>population actually dementia rates and<br>Alzheimer's disease as the most well<br>known form of dementia will be<br>increasing way beyond the aging of the<br>population we have no idea why 50 years<br>ago we used to blame aluminum in the<br>drinking water that was completely wrong<br>nowadays in the United States that are<br>trying to blame DDT that was used in the<br>farming industry and apparently there<br>was some research showing that if you<br>look at the brains of people who died<br>suffering from a terminal disease<br>there's a lot of DDT in their brains so<br>maybe that would be the next sort of a<br>guilty a molecule but no there's really<br>no good data on why more and more people<br>are suffering from dementia and the<br>prediction is that while only one in<br>nine of us people whole sixty and<br>although now will suffer from Alzheimer<br>disease if nothing is done to stop that<br>epidemic if you like when our<br>grandchildren are in their 70s one in<br>three of them will suffer from<br>Alzheimer's disease so we must do<br>something about it we can't cure out so<br>no disease so we need to look into<br>prevention and one of the ways that we<br>can go forward with in charging people<br>to change their lifestyles into a more<br>brain healthy lifestyle is if we make<br>sure that they do now and they have high<br>levels of literacy about brain health<br>and we know that beliefs about our<br>terminal disease and about other health<br>issues change the way people actually<br>react to advice about changing lifestyle<br>so if for example and we had one small<br>study here in Dunedin where we asked a<br>small group of health professionals<br>do they believe they'll suffer from<br>Arsenal disease and 99% of them said yes<br>it's inevitable as you age you will<br>suffer for my services which is<br>completely wrong as I said only one in<br>nine of us will suffer for my disease<br>but they were absolutely sure that<br>everyone will eventually suffer for<br>maximalism if you have that sort of<br>pessimistic outlook you're not really<br>going to do anything about changing your<br>lifestyle so we know from locally a<br>informed data but also from large<br>European health surveys that for example<br>there are increasing odds of exercising<br>daily once you understand why or once<br>you health literacy levels are adequate<br>people who understand why exercising is<br>so good for your body or your brain are<br>more likely to exercise people who have<br>no information or miss understanding in<br>the information about it unless likely<br>to change or to exercise daily so the<br>way we present information about brain<br>health can change how we will each to<br>eat our brains as we go through the life<br>cycle and as we age so we want to serve<br>there a representative sample of older<br>adults although being 50 to 75 although<br>the official dick definition of someone<br>who is old is anyone who is 10 years<br>older than yourself but we were looking<br>at people who are 50 to 75 because we<br>believe that this is the age group where<br>people are more aware of dementia they<br>may have parents who are struggling with<br>that or even partners so there are more<br>aware of the issue of memory because if<br>you try to talk to people while 15<br>adolescence and tell them hey you need<br>to change your lifestyle because in 70<br>years you may suffer for months and the<br>disease portably we haven't seen that<br>yet there is a project that we are<br>actually doing at the moment looking at<br>the brain health of adolescents and<br>young adults you don't know what they<br>know about the brain yet we<br>no in a few months but we can I think<br>safely assume that you need to be sort<br>of in midlife to start thinking about<br>your aging and your memory in the future<br>and maybe get ready to change your<br>lifestyle so we want to eventually<br>personalize the information that we can<br>give people about their brain health and<br>we know that one way is to use focus<br>groups and this is what we actually used<br>for our first stage in a long awfully<br>thoughtful journey of research so we<br>presented a series of five public<br>lectures at the Dunedin Public Library<br>these were advertised on the library<br>website in the library itself in posters<br>and in the face book but also in the<br>weekend edition of the Otago Daily Times<br>which apparently is the most read<br>newspaper in Otago so they say no if you<br>can believe me but good enough and the<br>talks were described as talks about<br>brain health and knowledge of at cyma<br>disease and prevention and they were<br>held every fortnight they were free for<br>about two hours every Thursday evening<br>in the library and we had a<br>questionnaire about brain health handed<br>out every every two weeks at the<br>beginning of the talk so that people<br>actually didn't hear the data before<br>they answer the questionnaire and what<br>were the questions we asked people well<br>Stan to open-ended questions what do you<br>believe are the three most important<br>risk factor for dementia and all you<br>believe are the three most important<br>protective factors from dementia and<br>then we had prompted questions some of<br>them are some of the answers are<br>completely non essica but we wanted to<br>see people also misinformed so we were<br>covering all the known well validated<br>evidence based risk and protective<br>factors but we also added a couple which<br>are completely not evidence-based just<br>to see how people know about those so<br>alcohol consumption or how this is oral<br>hygiene or hypertension high blood<br>pressure etc etc etc so we added in or<br>like gene &amp; Co Co cumin or if you like<br>and of course smoking in the<br>Mediterranean diet and prescription<br>drugs etc etc and finally we asked<br>people to tell us what they feel about<br>the following statements I model then<br>likely than the average person to suffer<br>from dementia in the future and as I<br>said 99% of medical professionals we<br>asked that question around Dunedin said<br>yeah sure I'm more than likely to have<br>dementia eventually and how would<br>suffering from dementia also know<br>disease would change your life and can<br>do you believe that changing lifestyle<br>behaviors can reduce the risk and will<br>it be too difficult for you and do you<br>know how to make these changes to<br>prevent also know disease and do you<br>really want to start making these<br>changes you know about them but you know<br>it's like dieting I always believe that<br>Monday morning I'll start on a good<br>weight loss diet so they have a lovely<br>weekend eating whatever is not pork<br>weight and then Monday morning comes and<br>you postpone it by another week no are<br>we really ready to start so who will the<br>people who answer the questionnaire<br>there were four hundred and one people<br>who came to the public lectures and<br>three hundred and forty were fifty years<br>or older which was our target population<br>and of those 216 consented to<br>participate in in this survey which is<br>about a 71 percent response rate just<br>about okay for surveys we like 75 78<br>sent response rates in in general public<br>service to make sure that they really<br>represent the population that we wish to<br>tap into a mean age was 65 yeah with a<br>range of between 50 and 93 there was a<br>great majority of women now this of<br>course is a biased population these are<br>people who made the effort to get out in<br>the evening get to the public library<br>sit down listen to a talk about brain<br>health questionnaire these people<br>probably had a vested interest because<br>maybe they had someone in the family who<br>suffered from outside of disease or they<br>were worried about their own aging or<br>they were interested in the subject for<br>any number of other reasons so there<br>will not only be a representative of the<br>general population but probably people<br>who are more interested in brain health<br>the great majority will use it on<br>Europeans and they were quite as you can<br>see very highly educated more than half<br>had a university degree so these are<br>people who are highly educated and<br>motivated to come and learn about<br>blindness so they are not a<br>representative sample of the general<br>population of older adults in New<br>Zealand and what did they tell us that<br>they know about a risk Oh protective<br>factor so in the open-ended question<br>loneliness was most commonly emphasized<br>by 24% or nearly one quarter one in four<br>said loneliness will increase your risk<br>of Alzheimer disease and that was<br>followed by genetics and smoking now<br>genetics is completely wrong as I know<br>disease is a sporadic disorder less than<br>one point five percent of in essence<br>less than one percent of the people who<br>do eventually suffer from internal<br>disease actually have a genetic mutation<br>that can explain the disease so 99<br>percent of Arsenal's disease is just<br>sporadic it just comes on nothing to do<br>with your genetics so genetics is<br>completely wrong and it's also very<br>pessimistic<br>if it's in your genes why do anything<br>about it just enjoying life and hope you<br>know so not a good<br>so people are misinformed smoking is bad<br>for you but it's not a major risk factor<br>if you stop smoking by the age of 50<br>when you're 65 15 years later your risk<br>of Alzheimer's due to smoking has been<br>reduced to that of the general<br>population<br>so if you are still a smoker by your<br>50th birthday just have a last smoke<br>give it up and then you'll do well if<br>you're still smoking now you should<br>really stop so and loneliness of course<br>is one of the major may be the top or<br>second risk factor for eternal disease<br>so people really knew about that what<br>about preventing that some disease<br>physical exercise was cited by about<br>half the people and that's to the<br>greatest effect size we have for<br>preventing other diseases actually<br>physical exercise followed by dietary<br>changes and cognitive training there's<br>hardly any evidence for cognitive<br>training but people were really happy<br>about it so you know people go around<br>saying oh I do my Sudoku Daily Sun<br>protected completely wrong the only if<br>you like challenging game that has been<br>tested and recommended by the American<br>government to prevent dementia is<br>playing bridge card game that's complex<br>enough to to probably help prevent<br>dementia in some sense and of the<br>prompted questions you can see the blue<br>line here this is the seventy five<br>percent mark which is considered in most<br>research on health literacy to be the<br>minimum level of literacy that would be<br>fined as adequate literacy so you can<br>see that out of 14 risk or protective<br>factors only four of them were actually<br>well recognized by this highly educated<br>Education that we still need to do<br>and information that the general public<br>doesn't actually know adequately enough<br>about brain health and what about health<br>beliefs about half of the people less<br>than 99% of des medical practitioners<br>were asked but half of the people<br>thought that they are at risk of<br>suffering from dementia more than the<br>average person<br>everyone agreed that suffering from<br>dementia would completely change your<br>life optically everyone believed that<br>you can reduce the risk of dementia<br>which is really a positive message they<br>will believe that you can make a change<br>now we just have to see how we can not<br>motivate them to do that change yeah<br>only a small percentage thought that<br>making a change in lifestyle would be<br>just too difficult you know getting out<br>of your couch not watching television<br>giving up on fatty food and stop smoking<br>exercising only 12 people said that'd be<br>too difficult great majority felt<br>confident if they can make lifestyle<br>changes and about 3/4 said we really<br>want to get on with it really soon so<br>that's a quite a positive message so the<br>going attention to cognitive health with<br>a sort of grave epidemic as the<br>Americans very you know sort of<br>aesthetically called the fact that world<br>population is aging the gray epidemic<br>will bring with it a huge increase in<br>the number of people struggling with<br>dementia and Alzheimer's disease we need<br>to understand what people think about<br>that what they feel about that what they<br>know about it so that we can help them<br>to make these changes that may help to<br>event and our conclusion is that older<br>adults here in Dunedin are not<br>adequately knowledgeable about dementia<br>risk and especially not about<br>nutritional factors but they are<br>optimistic in their ability to make it<br>change to lifestyle interventions so we<br>need to harness that positive attitude<br>and energy<br>and for the future we need to randomize<br>the representative sample much larger<br>than the one I showed you and actually<br>we have already completed recruiting one<br>thousand and four people aged 50 to 75<br>so we narrow the range not just 50 and<br>over in Otago and they are representing<br>something in the sense that they female<br>male ratio and the levels of education<br>and ethnicity and and living<br>arrangements and and and being rural or<br>in the city and everything represent<br>just perfectly they if you like the<br>average older adult in New Zealand and<br>we are hoping later this year to have<br>these results a ready for publication<br>and I can only quote my favorite medical<br>practitioner dr. sauce<br>the model who you read the more things<br>you know the more you learn the more<br>places you will go<br>so thank you and think we're open for<br>Georgina I am have a lovely catch box<br>which I will not throw at you but I will<br>run around and deliver it so that we can<br>hear you all does anyone have any<br>thank you<br>I have a question whether lyrical the<br>literacy of people I think I found that<br>you have in your questionnaires you are<br>something about him that Iranian diet um<br>I wonder is most people know what it<br>exactly is Mediterranean and whether<br>their knowledge about this but metal<br>ring and diet will affect the result<br>thank you thank you for that well I mean<br>the general question diet question was<br>sort of a sub question we first ask<br>people what they estimate the effects of<br>nutritional changes on their brain<br>health we<br>be and of the people who said that they<br>think some the people who said well<br>nutrition has nothing to do with brain<br>health we didn't ask them anymore<br>but the ones who said yes of course<br>nutrition can affect your brain has we<br>asked them simply have you ever heard of<br>the Mediterranean diet and the results<br>were disappointing both amongst our sort<br>of library talks focus group population<br>but also amongst medical practitioners<br>around the needing they have very little<br>of them have actually heard of the<br>Mediterranean diet or can describe its<br>principles the Mediterranean diet is a<br>the basic the basis of a diet called the<br>mind diet designed by the US government<br>which has been shown to reduce the risk<br>of disease by about 55 percent if you<br>had to be able to eat amazing I mean<br>there's nothing we can offer medically<br>that would even come close to this sort<br>of effect sizes but people<br>you're right are heavily aware of what<br>it actually means they have a vague idea<br>that the Mediterranean site somewhere<br>around Italy or France so not much<br>knowledge around that we are actually<br>here with the School of Medicine they're<br>producing a pamphlet on the mind diet<br>that we are going to with the help of<br>care the collaborative aging research<br>excellence with four so there were<br>waters was sort of supporting us to do<br>that so hopefully within a few months it<br>will be freely downloadable and people<br>will be able to know more about that and<br>I know that has to go soon and maybe<br>Sharon so does anyone have any questions<br>particularly pertaining to their<br>presentation yeah I was just wondering<br>if you'd like you did it with people<br>living at home what about some of your<br>like a retirement villages something<br>like that if you repeatedly like that is<br>only nurses speech yes<br>those people will have been included in<br>this group so so the assessments with<br>they will be people in retirement<br>villages people in 24-hour nursing ki or<br>hey I guess I kind of have a two-fold<br>question for anybody really and if we<br>were to project out to ten years for<br>example how do you think on the one hand<br>we might have removed the confusion that<br>many consumers feel about what to eat<br>what to do what to believe we should<br>learn who to follow etc and other ways<br>literacy in secondly in terms of<br>personalizing the programs that are<br>available the education or their<br>management or however we might describe<br>it to make individual choices<br>differently how could they look what<br>would it look like and who would be<br>involved and who would pay well to look<br>it's a it's a huge question because<br>where do people go to look for health<br>information or health and when you ask a<br>lot of people many younger people<br>obviously go to dr. Google OH<br>but even if you do go to dr. Google and<br>you get like 10 or 20 or 100 websites<br>how can you trust any of them and I<br>think personally I believe that the DHB<br>should actually be leading that and<br>saying hey if you're looking for health<br>information here are sites we recommend<br>for example the National Institute of<br>Health website the NIH website in the US<br>or the National Library of Medicine in<br>the US which is a really really<br>brilliant website and probably most of<br>us and professionals and researchers<br>would go there when we want to do some<br>reading or research or maybe Medscape or<br>maybe<br>but I think there should be sort of a<br>illiteracy committee that the DHB would<br>support saying you know for austerities<br>I want to learn about that not only<br>about the brain or diabetes<br>disobey where do I go to be informed and<br>not missing home<br>but it's surprising then and oh I'm sure<br>you have Dayton and shown as a GP the<br>number of people who come because they<br>read something somewhere but and our<br>feds and fashions and so coconut oil was<br>a big thing for a while I know if it was<br>here in the States<br>I had people Skype and call from the<br>state saying hey hey is coconut oil<br>going to kill my mother's so this was a<br>big thing for a while and I'm sure you<br>get questions about muscle and diet and<br>exercise what does exercise mean how<br>long what kind of exercise and as a GP<br>you probably get so many questions so I<br>think if it was up to me I would<br>encourage the DHB to have not a website<br>where they will put the information but<br>at least would recommend the major<br>important reliable links for people so<br>that could be one way to go about it the<br>Public Library system is so brilliant<br>not only here I was in Christ just<br>before I came here and New Zealand is<br>unique in that way I don't think many<br>was still have that kind of Public<br>Library system where people really go<br>and read and take books and can be<br>informed so maybe they can also be you<br>know part of that so but that's just my<br>personal take Aaron or Debra would you<br>like to swing yeah sure<br>I mean I'm very interested in health<br>literacy and it's part of my PhD<br>research and I think it's something<br>that's within the health sector is<br>recognized as a major problem for health<br>literacy so I think from the top top<br>down there for the you know the Ministry<br>of Health has got some documents now<br>around health literacy and the health<br>quality and safety commission also has<br>some guidelines for how health care<br>organizations<br>promote health literacy but I think at<br>this stage it's still very much up here<br>and not really down and the level it's<br>you know it's really a matter of waiting<br>to see how things emerge there are some<br>very well regarded and very patient<br>focused sites available but it's a<br>matter of advertising them and in making<br>people aware of what is a reputable<br>source it can be quite dizzy and to know<br>in a measure if you go to the most<br>reputable sites or read or what either<br>do I use a little assurance yeah we<br>begin how do they talk to you it seems<br>to be great you know and some don't<br>respond yes I just think there's a very<br>huge need for community-based<br>discussions and I know the library the<br>talks is part of it and it was a great<br>turnout but it's a great game as far as<br>I can see yeah evening this is a nice<br>little box it's a privilege to be here<br>it's great to hear the presentations<br>just just some comments I'm here on<br>personal title with my wife's money of<br>working in the fear that and their field<br>of healthcare and denene but just one of<br>the mentioned I'm also remembered the<br>seven babe minister here in the mean and<br>I know that in 2005 there was a big long<br>activity study in the National<br>Geographic around the Mediterranean and<br>free groups that uh yeah one of those<br>were the sim their minister being a very<br>very populated in the area of right in<br>the middle of Los Angeles which would<br>think you think that'd be highly<br>populated so not what semester cultural<br>war right in the middle of an<br>industrialized country like America and<br>I just wanted to say with<br>love as a church because we do run quite<br>a few chip programs health programs the<br>Adventist Church but many years has been<br>promoting things like not drinking not<br>smoking I think the first non-smoking<br>programs were presented vegetarian diet<br>all those things that were found to be<br>significant reducers of things like<br>Alzheimer would also cardiovascular<br>problems so at the mind we're actually<br>looking into because I'm hearing the<br>thing how could you involve the<br>community more we're really keen on also<br>looking in working together with those<br>health authorities who have the<br>knowledge we have quite a few medical<br>students because of that we have quite a<br>few medical students who come down to<br>Dunedin and who would love to be<br>involved in community projects involving<br>a healthier lifestyle not only nutrition<br>but things like drinking I'm the<br>selflessness work at the Salvation Army<br>addictions program here in Dunedin and<br>there's a lot that can be done for the<br>community and there's a lot being done<br>in the community already for many years<br>just wanted to put that out there I<br>would love to be somehow part of that<br>anyone here is looking at how could we<br>increase community projects in these<br>really important areas yeah yeah I guess<br>I can make a comment about what Jane was<br>saying also what you were just saying<br>about how do we reach out to the<br>community aging well national science<br>challenge that's based hosted here in<br>Dunedin is being mandated actually by<br>the government to try to take some lead<br>in getting these kinds of information<br>onto our website coordinating between<br>ministry of health dhb researchers<br>community groups that's a huge ask and<br>it's early days but I think that's what<br>we're moving towards because I think<br>there is a real gap with the information<br>there people in the community get it's<br>very conflicting miss confusing so you<br>know hopefully it's not going to happen<br>overnight but if the aging well national<br>science challenge can be successful in<br>trying to do this and engage with<br>community groups as well as other<br>organizations NGOs and DHBs<br>to try to coordinate our efforts to get<br>information where you can be a one-stop<br>you know if you go to the aging Rome<br>National Science Challenge website<br>there'll be resources there that you<br>know you can turn<br>but he's got a way to go great thank you<br>is it a quick question I'm just a<br>hi I'm my work and health emotion here<br>in Dunedin and I'm also a dietician just<br>in terms of the literacy in the issues<br>you are talking about a lot of the<br>alternate effects and fads that just<br>highly accessible on Facebook they<br>require a little effort there are<br>actually really good reads for general<br>people because they first stories and<br>they're done in the sensationalist way<br>that draws people in whereas a lot of<br>our messaging it's it's not as<br>accessible and because we're regulated<br>like doctors and all that we have to be<br>evidence-based so we can't like as fast<br>as we shut down one third 50 more spread<br>up and they just spread viral because<br>there's all the lifestyle Hicks and<br>nutritionists and people don't even<br>realize that a nutritionist can be a<br>five minute job on the Antony to get<br>that qualification there's no regulation<br>but no one understands that so these<br>stories spring up and they're really<br>engaging from a human aspect and people<br>latch onto them because it's hard but<br>sexy as fast how do we counter that you<br>can recommend going to a regulated<br>website but usually it's quite dull and<br>dry and hard to understand in comparison<br>so it just and people don't want to<br>spend time looking at different websites<br>click on Facebook it's there you've got<br>all those things so it's just something<br>to think about I mean it's it's easy to<br>make Facebook our greatest enemy or<br>friend but I think we we will have to<br>find a way to engage with social media<br>and I think like you know if we had a<br>group of people again the DHB or the<br>University depending on where well sort<br>of available to answer so you could have<br>sort of a program or project like ask me<br>and<br>you wanted a question send it in and be<br>answered so you know it has been done in<br>different places in different ways I<br>can't say I'm very knowledgeable about<br>how many people actually do have access<br>to Facebook here and how they change<br>across different age groups obviously<br>younger people are probably Facebook<br>wise well I'm not sure what percentage<br>of people over 75 would have a Facebook<br>account not many I would guess but we<br>would need to see that but but Facebook<br>is one place where we need to step<br>forward and say hey this is the team of<br>people that the DHB<br>puts forward for you to to ask questions<br>and we'll be happy to answer them we<br>must engage otherwise as you said people<br>just go off and you know come with just<br>the weirdest ideas you know it's amazing<br>what anyone would read and believe on<br>the internet if it's about buying it or<br>about losing weight or about exercising<br>no it's just it's an industry out there<br>and and we have to to somehow engage but<br>still keep that professional attitude we<br>can't be just friendly players in that<br>field it's complex patient education<br>that is too spaghetti as as behavior<br>changes to a brick wall you know patient<br>education doesn't make a behavior change<br>happens and it's those individual<br>choices and under vigil decision-making<br>we could read and learn and ask and<br>whatever that concerns may the<br>individual decision making the choices<br>at home that we're not addressing you<br>know we could ever plethora of knowledge<br>but the decisions don't get made at home<br>other ones or in the shop in the<br>supermarket<br>I completely agree that's why we're<br>trying to use a model that was designed<br>in must actually not patients but the<br>general public<br>go on to a public website for free<br>answer a couple of well not cover few<br>questions and be scored on their risk of<br>developing an sama disease in the future<br>so people actually have a number to<br>contend with and if they have a high<br>score they are offered for their<br>education participation and that seemed<br>to it made quite a change it's not just<br>knowing about stuff it's like looking at<br>yourself in the mirror and saying boy I<br>am at high risk I better do something<br>about it<br>so there are different ways to not<br>frighten people but get them more<br>engaged with change we will just have<br>one last question<br>I appreciate that we were supposed to<br>finish at 6:30 but everyone's very<br>patient mine's just a question about the<br>science when they investigated the<br>Mediterranean diet then they control for<br>the fact that most people who lived a<br>long time and well lived at the top of<br>very large villages and ran up and down<br>hills a lot I think I think there might<br>be a misunderstanding about the<br>Mediterranean diet some business and<br>longevity we're not looking at longevity<br>we are looking at cognitive health but I<br>mean the walking is too i it was it<br>controlled for them because it wasn't<br>and actually it is this hotspot of<br>longevity some of them are in around the<br>Mediterranean but very few most of them<br>are in Japan Okinawa<br>people don't really go up and down that<br>much very hilly island so it's not about<br>that and and obviously exercise and<br>smoking and other factors have been<br>accounted for<br>on its own changing one's diet in<br>midlife whatever it is you're eating<br>changing it into the recommended which<br>is actually a Spanish form of the<br>Mediterranean diet designed actually in<br>Madrid which is nowhere near the<br>Mediterranean coast but nevermind if you<br>change into date and add a few other<br>touches that the American government<br>added to that and you're actually using<br>something we call the mind diet with the<br>M standing for the Mediterranean but<br>other diets have been incorporated yes<br>we have controlled for exercise and<br>education and smoking and still within<br>three to five years of changing your<br>nutrition to the mind diet or the my<br>nutritional plan you will reduce your<br>risk of our summer disease by about<br>fifty five percent it can't get better<br>than that thank you thank you everyone<br>for coming out tonight<br>wrap up the seminars thank you to all of<br>our speakers I'd like to thank you<br>Georgina for being with us
