For more information, visit https://fmhs-50years-events.blogs.auckland.ac.nz.<br><br>The last 50 years have seen profound changes in death rates for several major groups of diseases, particularly heart disease and cancer. A number of changes in lifestyle and healthcare have produced these dramatic effects, which have led to marked increases in life expectancy leading to a dramatic change in age distributions across the population. This lecture looked at what has driven these changes, the challenges created by having a much larger number of elderly individuals, and contrasted this with the continuing challenges which exist in the care of the youngest and most vulnerable members of our community.<br><br>Speakers:<br>‘Living Longer – the Data’ Professor Alistair Woodward, Head of the Section of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Population Health, University of Auckland<br>‘Living Longer – the Consequences’ Professor Martin Connolly, Freemasons’ Professor of Geriatric Medicine and Assistant Dean of

audience for presentations<br>tonight I'm Alexandra McCarthy head of<br>the School of Nursing and tonight we are<br>actually going to hear about the<br>inevitable aging is something that none<br>of us can avoid but I'm sure we're going<br>to hear some very sound advice tonight<br>as to how to deal with it the best way<br>that we can we've got a very very<br>stellar line-up for you tonight starting<br>with an overview of what aging currently<br>looks like in New Zealand and then we're<br>going to move into the intricacies of<br>sight and hearing as we grow older and<br>conclude with the discussion of the<br>consequences for our generation in<br>particular of living longer<br>I think the alarming thing about the<br>presentations tonight is that we are the<br>first and with the rising obesity in all<br>Western countries probably the last<br>generation to live as long as we are<br>going to so we're here tonight to<br>actually understand how to make the best<br>of it I'm going to in the interest of<br>time as well because the presentations<br>are going to be very captivating you'll<br>have a lot of questions but we'll save<br>them for the end where we'll have a<br>little bit of time to actually take a<br>few questions from the audience and<br>we're going to start with a brief word<br>from sue brewster who is executive<br>oh look good evening everybody is<br>introduced sue Brewster and I'm the<br>executive director of Auckland medical<br>research foundation and I'm really<br>really delighted with how many of you<br>have tuned out tonight we're a bit<br>worried when we saw the weather the rain<br>does tend to put a few people off so<br>thank you very much for coming out and<br>the range of presentations tonight are<br>going to be all worth your while so a<br>big THANK YOU I think the topic tonight<br>as a subject use my heart my mother<br>lives with us and mum is 85 and funnily<br>enough I meet up with cliff this week<br>and I was talking to Claire about mum<br>and he's<br>to me well is as your mum 85 years young<br>or she 85 years old and I think that's a<br>really good distinction because I think<br>aging well and living well for an older<br>population as all key to that quality of<br>life so and on that note I would like to<br>pay special tribute to emeritus<br>professor ke Batson who passed away on<br>the 12th of July at the age of 91 so for<br>those of you who know ke an<br>extraordinary man who lived life well<br>and made amazing advances in medical<br>research and in all of our quality of<br>life and health so special tribute to ke<br>but look once again and I think from our<br>perspective I would love to thank all of<br>our supporters here tonight I think<br>since 1955 we've funded 71 million<br>dollars worth of medical research in the<br>Greater Oakland region so it's only you<br>supporters that are here tonight that<br>have made that possible and I guess<br>continue investing and the quality of<br>life for everybody so a mess of thank<br>you I really know you'll enjoy tonight's<br>presentations and I will hand back over<br>our first speaker tonight is Professor<br>Alistair Wood Wood fresh from Barcelona<br>Alistair is a public health medicine<br>specialist who graduated from the<br>University of Adelaide and her study and<br>worked in universities in Britain in the<br>US and obviously in New Zealand he was<br>the first head of the school of<br>population health after it's moved to<br>the Tamaki camp campus he works on<br>environmental health issues such as air<br>pollution physical activity and climate<br>change and is presently head of the<br>section of Epidemiology and<br>biostatistics of particular relevance to<br>tonight's lecture he recently published<br>a book the healthy country question mark<br>a history of life and death in New<br>Zealand so please welcome Alistair<br>thank you very much sandy and it's great<br>to see the lecture theater full<br>wonderful the the topic for tonight is<br>the social revolution that we face as a<br>consequence of the population living<br>longer it really is a revolution because<br>it's something that's happened that<br>unprecedented and I believe it's going<br>to have implications for every aspect of<br>our life<br>we've got a section on the data to start<br>with because I I think that many people<br>don't appreciate just how substantial<br>the changes are that have occurred how<br>significant they are just what the<br>consequences are going to be and as a<br>result I think people either are sort of<br>not aware of what's happening or they<br>frightened by it because they understand<br>it fully but think it may be leading us<br>you know into a new ice age<br>it's important to understand what's<br>happening in order to appreciate the<br>challenges and I think you'll see<br>tonight that there certainly are<br>challenges in front of us but it's not<br>the Ice Age that's coming over the<br>horizon there are new opportunities as<br>well as the consequence of people living<br>longer and as I'll make the case and not<br>only living longer but living better<br>living healthier for longer than they<br>have in the past so that's my job really<br>to tell you a little bit about the basis<br>for this social revolution and other<br>speakers are going to talk to you about<br>some of the implications the clinical<br>implications of this enormous change in<br>survival and demographics now this as<br>you know who is part of it a series of<br>lectures celebrating 50 years at the<br>University of Auckland Medical School<br>and those 50 years have seen a<br>must change here we have the class of 68<br>now I wasn't I didn't graduate from the<br>University of Aucklanders and he just<br>said and I'm not quite old enough to<br>have been in the class of 68 but close<br>to and one of the things that was<br>drilled into me as a medical student<br>around this time was that the job of<br>medicine was to add life to years not<br>years to life and the basis for that was<br>the view that the human lifespan was<br>more or less fixed you know the the<br>Bible had laid it all out as that laid<br>out many things a long time ago<br>threescore years and ten was what you<br>could expect and indeed that was what<br>people were living and it wasn't gonna<br>change and so the job of medicine and<br>the healthcare system generally was to<br>ensure that you got as much quality in<br>there at 70 years as you possibly could<br>I was told many things in medical school<br>that were subsequently proven to be<br>absolutely wrong and that was one of<br>them because that's not the way it's<br>turned out and I think it's really<br>important that we appreciate how it has<br>turned out and just what the<br>implications might be so here we have<br>life expectancy at birth this is for men<br>the pattern for women is similar but not<br>exactly the same in New Zealand going<br>back to the 1940s but if you have a look<br>at 1968 or roughly where 1968 might sit<br>on this graph 1965 1968 here and the New<br>Zealand nan Mary is the Green Mary is<br>the purple let's just look for the time<br>being at the nan Mary life expectancy so<br>look at the Green Line here so what was<br>happening to male life expectancy in New<br>Zealand in the 1960<br>in early 1970s it was it was not<br>changing was it and it's about 70 a<br>little bit under 70 so that was why my<br>lecturers said to me you know we've got<br>threescore years and ten that's pretty<br>much where it's going to sit but look<br>what happened subsequently you know the<br>lines going up up up up up up up up up<br>and for the non Maori men in New Zealand<br>life expectancy now is about 80 but over<br>80 it's very close to world best for men<br>which is the blue line at the top and it<br>is nudging ahead of the Australian<br>figures not that that matters in the<br>slightest<br>now the story for Maori is different and<br>I'm going to come back to that shortly<br>but the point I wanted to make here is<br>that what appeared to be the picture in<br>1968 when this medical school got going<br>appeared to be the case in the early 70s<br>when I was a medical student is proven<br>to be quite wrong and instead we've<br>added 10-15 years of life expectancy on<br>top of what applied in 1968 indeed as<br>I'm going to show you just as a rule of<br>thumb a way of thinking about it in<br>recent in the last 30 years New Zealand<br>has added three years of life to everyda<br>everyday cade so every 10 years life<br>expectancy has gone up by 3 3 years<br>almost the same as you know every day<br>getting another 8 hours of life you know<br>in the day and all of a sudden you've<br>got 8 hours more in front of you than<br>you did before so that is extraordinary<br>what could possibly cause it where is it<br>leading us those are the sorts of<br>questions that follow just to give you a<br>sense of what I talked about I talked<br>about life expectancy which is you know<br>a statistical term it's a convenient way<br>of summarizing mortality across the<br>lifespan and here I've got death rates<br>by age in 1901 and 2011 for New Zealand<br>and the 1901 graph was the one at the<br>top here with the fainter line and 2011<br>is here showing that the curve has been<br>shifted to the right and the peak that<br>applied in 1901 in infancy when<br>mortality rates were extremely high in<br>the first year of life has reduced<br>enormous ly you know one of the enormous<br>great achievements of the last hundred<br>years is over coming in<br>and mortality Oh life expectancy is le<br>that's what it stands for that's the<br>average years of life lived and if you<br>remember I'm not sure if you remember<br>statistics some of you may have studied<br>it at some stage you know there's a<br>difference between average or mean and<br>median and mode so median means the 50th<br>percentile so halfway through the<br>distribution and mode<br>what does mode mean most common yeah so<br>you can see the life expectancies or the<br>average has gone up from 57 to about 83<br>that's in the space of 110 years the<br>median so that's what 50% of the<br>population could expect has gone up from<br>66 to 86 and the most common age at<br>death now is into the early 90s so the<br>difference between the mean which is the<br>average and the most common is important<br>if we're thinking about the implications<br>now I said that life expectancy as a way<br>of sort of condensing into one figure a<br>quite complex picture and just to give<br>you a sense of the complexity I'm<br>showing here that mortality rates for<br>the most common causes of death in New<br>Zealand cancer skimming heart disease<br>cerebral Rescue leur disease or stroke<br>chronic lower respiratory disease which<br>is sort of pneumonia I mean they are the<br>major ones and this is again going back<br>to the sort of end of the Second World<br>War<br>taking us up to the current day and you<br>can see that in each instance these<br>deaths from these diseases of fallen<br>from cancer many people don't appreciate<br>that but we're seeing substantial<br>year-on-year improvements in cancer<br>mortality<br>cardiovascular disease look at that you<br>know when I was a medical student we<br>were at the peak and indeed that was the<br>reason that male life expectancy had<br>stalled because we were going through<br>the at the peak of the epidemic of heart<br>disease since then since the since I<br>graduated mortality from heart disease<br>has fallen by over 80% it's really<br>changed the world of medicine and<br>healthcare and all the other causes that<br>you can see there I think without<br>exception every Joost so when we talk<br>about a social revolution a healthcare<br>revolution and you know we're looking at<br>this picture where the world is<br>different to the way it was now um the<br>question of how far we can go you know<br>is this going to continue this was the<br>question that got Tony Blakeley and I<br>interested in writing the book that<br>sandy referred to the healthy country<br>because for 80 years<br>New Zealand non-maori were the<br>healthiest in the world we were highest<br>average life expectancy 1860 to 1940<br>nobody had written about it before<br>looked very closely at it so that was<br>the impetus for our book but you can see<br>the the line here the straight line has<br>drawn through world maximum average life<br>expectancy which has gone from forty<br>five so the healthiest population in the<br>world had lived on average for forty<br>five years<br>in 1850 a hundred and sixty years later<br>you've had forty years added to life<br>expectancy forty years in a hundred and<br>sixty it's the same as three months<br>every year being added to life<br>expectancy and and the the the<br>remarkable thing about it is that it's<br>linear you know it's just going and<br>going and going and going<br>so for individual countries of course<br>they've been perturbations and that's<br>apparent<br>the colored graphs there that show four<br>different countries the effects of flu<br>epidemics of world wars of other<br>disasters but in terms of what humans<br>can aspire to at present we don't know<br>what the limit is countries like Japan<br>which the longest lived in the world<br>still year-on-year their mortality rates<br>are improving mind-boggling now the<br>question of what the explanation for<br>this might be is partly captured in this<br>table which shows you the age specific<br>contribution so which of the age groups<br>that have been responsible for this<br>remarkable improvement in mortality in<br>New Zealand and elsewhere and it began<br>with infant survival so to begin with<br>the top left-hand corner of the graph of<br>the table it was children improvements<br>and mortality and children that were<br>responsible for driving increased<br>longevity but that's no longer the case<br>if you come across to the last 20 years<br>you know mortality in childhood has<br>fallen so far that there are not many<br>gains still to be made where the<br>improvement is coming from is reducing<br>mortality in the elderly and not just in<br>what you might call the young elderly 65<br>to 79 but the older elderly over 80 more<br>than half the reduction more than half<br>of the improvement in life expectancy is<br>now coming from reductions in mortality<br>now there are some other things that<br>were regarded as certainties that are<br>not certainties and one of them is this<br>question of differences between men and<br>women and again I remember being<br>instructed that men were the weaker sex<br>and they wouldn't never expect to live<br>as long as women did and there was a<br>five or a six year gap<br>now that as you can see here is not<br>fixed and concrete overtime the<br>difference between men and women has<br>changed and continues to change as you<br>can see here the gap between male and<br>female life expectancy in New Zealand is<br>currently declining men are catching up<br>on women and we believe that's a<br>consequence of several things one of<br>which is men were first to take up<br>cigarettes and they gave them up earlier<br>than women did the cardiovascular<br>epidemic has receded and that particular<br>particularly on men the story is<br>different for married as you can see<br>when statistics were first available<br>marry men lived longer than marry women<br>and that was a consequence largely of<br>their appalling<br>maternal mortality and mortality related<br>to reproduction that married women<br>suffered at the time now I'd like to<br>just lean a bit on this notion of<br>variations and life expectancy because<br>the average very much hides a spread a<br>wide spread of experience here in New<br>Zealand and this is important in terms<br>of what we should do in terms of<br>priorities and in terms of also what we<br>could achieve Daniel su column is a<br>honours student who worked with Dan<br>Exeter and I last year and I'd suggest<br>that he look at life expectancy across<br>the Auckland transport network and so<br>what Daniel did was to take the bus<br>stations on the northern busway and the<br>train stations on the southern side of<br>the bridge and to look at life<br>expectancy of the populations within two<br>kilometers of each station you can<br>understand how that might be done and<br>what he has shown is the startling<br>variation within one city as you travel<br>from Albany - oh - whoh<br>life expectancy Falls 11 years now it's<br>not an even gradient you know you can<br>see the colors are mixed up here<br>but the point I'd like to make is that<br>we talked about an average of 82 years<br>life expectancy that hides an enormous<br>variation the married non marry<br>differential I've already referred to<br>but there are other differences in terms<br>of socioeconomic status and in terms of<br>other ethnicities so this tells us that<br>we have some work to do people say how<br>could we live longer well it's not a<br>question I believe of technology or<br>treatments it's a question of working<br>out how everybody in New Zealand could<br>have the same experience as the people<br>who live in Albany<br>does anybody here live in Albany so what<br>is it about being an Albany that enables<br>you to live so long the experience of<br>Mari I mentioned that is something that<br>is of great importance to us here in New<br>Zealand for many reasons it's a very sad<br>history in terms of the effects of<br>colonization and loss and deprivation<br>and on meri health they started from a<br>long way back it wasn't any of their<br>doing it certainly wasn't biologically<br>determined it was a consequence of<br>history the good news so that's the bad<br>news that they were six or seven years<br>adrift the good news is that that gap is<br>not widely and we believe there's some<br>evidence that it's narrowing here in<br>Auckland the life expectancy for Maori<br>is increasing currently at twice the<br>rate of non meri this was reported by<br>white a Matar dhb last year so bad news<br>good news story bad news that we have<br>these gaps good news is that<br>certainly not fixed in stone that they<br>can be changed and at least an Auckland<br>they appear to be changed changing in<br>the right direction now the big question<br>when you talk about living longer is<br>whether it's a good idea I mean is this<br>something we should really aspire to and<br>behind that it lies a fear of aging<br>people associated I think with loss with<br>misery with unhappiness with separation<br>but of course there's absolutely no<br>reason why that should be so and the<br>question of whether the improvement in<br>life expectancy has been accompanied by<br>an improvement and healthy life<br>expectancy is a really important one at<br>the same time it's a very difficult one<br>to answer because what defines a healthy<br>life expectancy it's easy enough by and<br>large to tell whether somebody's alive<br>or not but to tell whether they are<br>healthy or not is that something that<br>people decide for themselves is that<br>something that you determine on the<br>basis of a blood test how do you do it<br>well this is work from the Ministry of<br>Health<br>it's a bit old now but it was a good<br>stair but answering this question which<br>looked at years of life lived<br>independently or years of life lived in<br>various ways judged in various ways to<br>be dependent and you can see here that<br>we are talking remember I said about<br>three years and every decade improvement<br>and life expectancy bit more for men<br>than for women so that's the height of<br>the bars here and the proportion in blue<br>is the extra years lived independently<br>not dependent so good news bad news<br>story bad news is that there is extra<br>years of life lived dependently<br>but the good news is that they are<br>outnumbered two to one<br>by years lived with healthy and a<br>healthy life expectancy so an extra 10<br>in extra three years every 10 one of<br>those three is lived in compromised<br>health two of those three is lived in<br>good health is that a good story or is<br>that a bad story well I'm a an optimist<br>I would see that as a desirable state of<br>affairs there are other indications that<br>people who reach the age of 70 80 90<br>these days are in better shape than<br>people in the past reaching the same age<br>that's important for cognitive decline<br>which is a major issue for us<br>in terms of ageing where it's observed<br>that in later birth cohorts people born<br>later times the frequency of cognitive<br>decline of dementia of other mental<br>conditions of that kind is lower than it<br>was previously<br>so it's not to say that we can turn back<br>the effects of aging but the effect is<br>less amongst individuals of a certain<br>age now than it was in the past a good<br>way of describing this as this<br>remarkable man Don Pellman so this is<br>two years ago he repeated the<br>achievement of Jesse Owens you may<br>remember Jesse Owens at the Berlin<br>Olympics he broke four world records in<br>the space of an afternoon that had not<br>been done again until Don Pellman<br>fronted up at the Masters Games in 2015<br>and he broke four world records in the<br>space of an afternoon in his age group<br>he was born only two years after Jesse<br>Owen he's a contemporary of Jessie iron<br>and so my point being obviously he's an<br>extraordinary man but there's a bigger<br>picture here which says that people are<br>living longer and they're generally<br>living longer in better shape than they<br>I'm not going to go into that because<br>I've almost used up my time but I can<br>say I think we can point to some<br>important things that have happened<br>recently<br>you know since 1968 which have<br>contributed in terms of having a better<br>environment enlightened social<br>legislation and as I've already<br>mentioned better medical care what's<br>missing in this picture of the southern<br>motorway<br>well it's different in many ways from<br>how it looks these days I suppose but<br>you might notice the very effect of<br>median barrier this location which was<br>introduced by the way as a consequence<br>of agitation by the doctors and the<br>emergency department at Auckland<br>Hospital who were fed up with having to<br>deal with the damage resulting so you<br>know just an example of environmental<br>changes that have occurred and what<br>about social policy you know could you<br>imagine traveling like this in an<br>aeroplane it was once the way we went<br>got around and as I've mentioned here<br>a truly smoke-free childhood once a<br>rarity is now commonplace so you know<br>there have been huge changes in the<br>world in the last 50 years that's not<br>too difficult to draw the dots in terms<br>of how those changes have led to the<br>kinds of improvement in survival that<br>I've talked about and maybe we can<br>pursue that later in the question time<br>where are we heading I think we might<br>get to a century of life expectancy by<br>the end of the century it's a daunting<br>sort maybe but as you can see if present<br>trends continue we are likely to have<br>life expectancy for women of about 95<br>which means you'll have a 50% chance<br>women born in that in 2000 2100 of<br>getting close to a hundred so I've more<br>than used up my time this is what I want<br>to tell you an average life expectancy<br>increasing by about three months every<br>year that is absolutely remarkable<br>it's Earth's moving it's it's social<br>revolution indeed substantial social<br>inequalities don't forget that map of<br>the auckland transport network but some<br>signs that they're closing healthy life<br>expectancy is also rising two years of<br>every three that we gain h decade is<br>good life<br>the causes have touched on that very<br>lightly no sign yet of a slowdown and if<br>you've got a chance to see a movie and<br>you haven't seen this one go and see<br>Michael Caine in going in style<br>absolutely wonderful you're never too<br>old to get even that's his message thank<br>you very much I wish we had an hour to<br>listen to you<br>Alastair that was fascinating thank you<br>now we're going to delve into hearing as<br>we age with Professor Peter thorn Peter<br>is an auditory neuroscientist at the<br>University of Auckland he directs the<br>odd selmour Center for research on<br>hearing and balance disorders and is a<br>co-director of brain research New<br>Zealand which is a natural national<br>center of research excellence that's<br>focused on the aging brain he's<br>published widely on cochlear<br>pathophysiology and sensory neural<br>hearing loss and he established the<br>clinical audiology training program at<br>the University here Peter contributes<br>substantially to the hearing impaired<br>community and he was made a companion of<br>the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2009<br>that's great thank you very much but<br>Alice has given you a wonderful talk<br>about life expectancy and and what I'm<br>going to talk a little bit about is I<br>suppose maintaining good health or some<br>aspect of good health as we get older<br>and my area is in is in the area of<br>hearing and what I was asked to do<br>really was just to delve into a little<br>bit of this story and particularly<br>thinking about some of the impacts on on<br>cognition and and some of the data which<br>is coming out that suggests that hearing<br>loss might actually be a contributor to<br>cognitive decline and potentially a risk<br>factor or a modifiable factor for for<br>dementia what I thought I'd do first of<br>all was just to talk a bit about what<br>our sense of hearing is and I think that<br>we tend to take our sense of hearing for<br>granted that's a very very important<br>sense that we just perhaps don't realize<br>what it's capable of and in its<br>importance and if it if you go back to<br>some of the writings of Helen Keller and<br>this is just a paraphrase from here that<br>the view that with hearing loss and in<br>this case profound deafness actually<br>cuts you off from people so the issue<br>here is about maintaining a connection<br>with people and I would just add to that<br>it also separates you from your<br>environment and what I just like to talk<br>a bit about is how important your sense<br>of hearing is not only to communication<br>but also to your place in the world and<br>your connection with your environment so<br>perhaps this whole idea is about hearing<br>is really if you think about it was<br>actually staying connected with with<br>various aspects of living for example<br>it's really important in terms of<br>learning and and taking opportunities<br>that might be presented to us<br>as we as we need to it's about staying<br>connected with each other you know<br>through communication and it's very<br>importantly about staying connected to<br>the world around us through awareness of<br>sound in our environment so we think<br>about some of these different things and<br>think about hearing in terms of<br>interaction and communication we can we<br>can understand us the importance of it<br>for social engagement the importance of<br>it for for emotion you know that the<br>particular that comes from that social<br>engagement of enjoyment<br>the issues are sadness although sort of<br>emotions that might come through social<br>engagement important key element to<br>developing and maintaining relationships<br>to work and to learning and I think this<br>little image here of a young boy at<br>school who has a hearing loss in this<br>case completely tuned out just not able<br>to in this environment take part and is<br>not clear what's going on so it has a<br>huge impact on learning and we can all<br>appreciate I'll sure how important our<br>sense of hearing is unto into enjoyment<br>into emotional aspects of life whether<br>we appreciate music whether it be a<br>blues band or it's an orchestra the more<br>these days the idea of being tuned into<br>your iPod or your cell phone for hours<br>on end listening to to music or to to<br>podcast and so forth but also just<br>remembering the importance of being out<br>in nature listening to the whistling of<br>the of the birds were chirping of birds<br>and obviously you know things like the<br>rustling of leaves and so forth which<br>give a lot to our enjoyment of our life<br>but also our hearing is really important<br>for awareness and for safety so if you<br>think about your hearing system enables<br>you to have content through three demint<br>to a 3-dimensional world to<br>environmental sounds that provide that<br>that real will contact and areas for<br>example in terms of safety that being<br>able to listen for warning signals are<br>very important in this case in the sort<br>of traffic environment or even in your<br>own home where you may need to know<br>about warning signals about fire or so<br>forth it's very important for<br>maintaining your safety and one of the<br>things about your auditory system is it<br>never ever turns off you tune out but<br>it's always on we don't like the visual<br>system you have an island you can turn<br>it up you can reduce the the light but<br>you don't have an ear load your system<br>is on constantly but it can be<br>stimulated it can turn you can tune tune<br>itself down but it doesn't turn itself<br>off so it's constantly sensing the<br>environment the other thing we can just<br>think about is obviously our hearing<br>starts with our ears I mean that's where<br>the Sounders<br>coming in it's being detected and this<br>being passed into nerve impulses that go<br>to various parts of the brain which are<br>the auditory centers in the brain which<br>were responsible for detection of speech<br>analysis or sound for complex sounds I<br>want to make this point here that we you<br>might not be aware but you have two ears<br>and they're very important that we have<br>to because even if you have a loss of<br>hearing in one ear you're actually quite<br>seriously disadvantaged but the other<br>thing about our auditory system and<br>these are just showing the pathways here<br>going from our ear through to the part<br>of the brain and the auditory cortex out<br>here on the temporal lobe which are<br>responsible for receiving all the<br>complex information from our ears but<br>our auditory system is also connected<br>with their emotional centers it's<br>connected with our memory centers deep<br>into the hippocampus for example which<br>is very very important for memories so<br>our system our auditory system is not<br>just dealing with it with with the the<br>the access to sound but also the<br>consequences of that sound to to to life<br>and we also have a lot of interaction<br>between vision and hearing and a lot of<br>our different sensory systems they're<br>not all working independently they're<br>all working together to give us once<br>again an ability to sense our<br>environment and to and to communicate so<br>in many ways we now know that through<br>both staying can enter we and we might<br>hear a little boy about this later on<br>but both staying connected and hearing<br>is very very important part of this you<br>can sort of see is we know that staying<br>connected is really important for<br>healthy aging for brain health that<br>socialization relationship with our<br>environment and additionally now we know<br>that if you have a hearing loss as we<br>age that that has a considerable impact<br>on your health and well-being and I'll<br>just go through some of these issues<br>very briefly so let's think about<br>age-related hearing loss<br>well the deficits and hearing is quite<br>substantial enough in our population and<br>if you look at the the graph here<br>showing that the percentage of people<br>with hearing loss<br>in the population it's really something<br>for those people in older age<br>particularly over about the age of 15<br>and what you see is not only is that the<br>amount of hearing loss is increasing but<br>also the severity so as we get older<br>we're also becoming more severely<br>hearing impaired and so the impact of<br>that on healthy living is is quite<br>substantial and as Alistair was talking<br>about because of those aging population<br>there are some statistical modeling<br>which has now being done to show that<br>the amount the proportion of the<br>population that might having severe<br>hearing loss will be rising quite<br>dramatically over the next few decades<br>so what can we do about it I mean this<br>is a it's a very very important health<br>and probably and a social problem which<br>we need to think about we need to<br>improve our awareness of the<br>implications to general health and<br>well-being so it's not just focusing on<br>just general communication we really<br>need ways to detect it particularly<br>amongst older people to diagnose and<br>provide those interventions early enough<br>and there's a number of things which we<br>need to think about you know obviously<br>equitable and accessible services limit<br>of disease and so forth and and access<br>to technology but particularly is around<br>the sort of prevention and public health<br>strategies which are really important to<br>try and prevent the hearing loss and for<br>this at the University of Auckland we've<br>now established a Center which focuses<br>on research into hearing and balance<br>disorders and this is a center includes<br>a lot of groups around the world around<br>the country and the focus of this is<br>really to try and work with the clinical<br>groups with research groups and with the<br>community to start thinking about how we<br>can really develop interventions and<br>community interventions in particular to<br>reduce the reduce the impact of hearing<br>loss so what is it just coming back to -<br>thinking about this relationship with<br>healthy aging obviously from what I've<br>been saying so far keeping socially<br>active but hearing is very important for<br>that I've shown a few minutes that seems<br>to be particularly important around<br>cognitive vitality and avoiding dementia<br>it may be particularly important in<br>terms of avoiding injury so that you can<br>be aware of warning signals and so forth<br>and so it seems to be tied<br>clearly to a lot of different aspects of<br>trying to maintain a healthy brain and<br>then healthy aging as we as we age and<br>now we have another issue which is has<br>emerged from a number of longitudinal<br>studies which is showing that there is a<br>link between hearing loss and cognitive<br>decline and odometer dimension and so if<br>you look at some of the data that's come<br>out of the u.s. the risk of developing<br>dementia increases are quite<br>substantially in this case close to a<br>four-fold increase with severe hearing<br>loss if where these people have been<br>following over time there's been an<br>increase in that and how might this what<br>might this be related to so we there's a<br>suggestion that maybe it's to do with<br>changes in brain structure which might<br>be common across these two the<br>age-related hearing loss and cognitive<br>decline perhaps a big part of it is that<br>withdrawal the social isolation that<br>occurs so that connectedness may have an<br>impact and there may be some common fit<br>features which are sort of common<br>pathology and pathological processes<br>that affect both parts and there may be<br>some sort of common mechanistic process<br>which we don't fully understand you just<br>to show you that some of the work which<br>we've been doing looking at the auditory<br>part of the brain is part of the brain<br>which the cortex which is associated<br>with with audition if you look at some<br>of the pathological changes which are<br>associated with Alzheimer's disease<br>they're clearly present for example this<br>particular protein tower and Emma Lloyd<br>data which are proteins that associated<br>with with pathology of Alzheimer's are<br>clearly more present in the inside the<br>the auditory part of the brain in<br>Alzheimer's patients and if you look at<br>that even the number of neurons inside<br>the part of the brain which is actually<br>involved in audition in in patient of<br>people with Alzheimer's is really is<br>severely reduced so that the processes<br>which are possible within the auditory<br>brain are going to be severely<br>compromised in people with Alzheimer's<br>and interestingly is that the part of<br>the brain which seems to be more<br>affected in our timers at the Orchard<br>Park is actually in the left hemisphere<br>which is that<br>part of your auditory brain which is<br>associated with speech and language and<br>pitch perception which are you know the<br>areas which are quite considerable<br>within with people with with dementia<br>we've got a long way to prove whether<br>these are associated with the positive<br>but at least we started to see that<br>there were changes in the orchard brain<br>another piece of work which we're doing<br>is asking questions using our dementia<br>prevention research clinics which are<br>the part of the brain research New<br>Zealand the series of clinics right<br>around the country we were recruiting<br>people who have early cognitive decline<br>and following them over time and we're<br>investigating here under the direction<br>of Susan Purdy here looking at the<br>sensory status of these people as they<br>enter into the clinic and asking<br>questions whether these sensory changes<br>might be maybe a biomarker maybe they're<br>early changes of of cognitive decline<br>that may tell us something about the the<br>progression for for these patients and<br>just in that just to sort of show you<br>very quickly the data we have is that<br>yes people with early cognitive decline<br>against the age match controls they show<br>difficulties in conversation and<br>localizing sound poor processing of<br>complex sounds and they also show very<br>poor processing of emotion within there<br>in the auditory in their visual field as<br>well so it seems as if these are<br>measures that are sensitive to changes<br>and we need to now need to think about<br>and we're piloting whether we can<br>perhaps train people in the auditory and<br>visual domains to try and improve the<br>development of cognitive impairment and<br>just very very quickly and I are just<br>sort of running out of time here but<br>very quickly there is now The Lancet<br>commissioners last year came out looking<br>at the risk factors for dementia and<br>they have suggested that one of the most<br>predominant disparate risk factors or<br>dominant risk factors is hearing loss<br>and that if you can treat that hearing<br>loss as they suggest in early years the<br>mid years here perhaps you can reduce<br>the rate at which dementia develops and<br>so there was a clinical trial going on<br>now to look at the impact of hearing<br>aids<br>on cognitive decline and we're going to<br>wait to see the outcome it's a very big<br>study in the u.s. to see whether this<br>has an impact which will be very<br>important for the progression of these<br>conditions and just finally there is a<br>piece of work going on here supported by<br>the Health Research Council and led by<br>ground search field and audiology and<br>what's interesting here is what he's<br>looking at is if you're going to fit<br>these hearing aids you're fitting quite<br>complex devices to people who might have<br>cognitive problems and so the devices<br>are actually more advanced than the<br>content of processing of the person that<br>you're fitting them to and so what he's<br>looking at is if you actually altered<br>these hearing aids that they have a very<br>much slower cognitive processing power<br>will that optimize or or improve the the<br>the influence I suppose on hearing for<br>these for people with cognitive chat<br>problems and so what I just wanted to<br>try and show you is that number one<br>hearing is very important for good brain<br>health it's very important for your<br>well-being<br>we need awareness campaigns and and we<br>need ways to be able to provide hearing<br>interventions which are equitable and<br>accessible as almost along the same<br>lines as Alice was talking about strong<br>prevention and public health programs to<br>encourage people to use their hearing<br>and remain connected so as I say look<br>after your hearing and stay connected<br>it's may be far more important than you<br>actually realize thank you<br>I'm sure you'll have many questions to<br>Peter at the end of the session in the<br>interest of time we'll move on to<br>professor Helen Danish Meyer who is a<br>professor in the Department of<br>Ophthalmology she's a clinician<br>scientist and helen divides her time<br>equally between patient care surgery and<br>research helen graduated from the<br>university of otago and undertook her<br>subspecialty training at Will's Heart<br>Hospital in Philadelphia in 2008 she was<br>appointed as the Sir William and Lady<br>Stephen professor of Ophthalmology<br>making her the youngest professor in the<br>medical school and the first female<br>professor of Ophthalmology in New<br>Zealand she is head of academic law coma<br>and neuro-ophthalmology and the founder<br>and director of the optic nerve research<br>unit she's also chair of glaucoma in New<br>Zealand which is a charitable trust that<br>focuses on preventing blindness from<br>that's not that's ok we're gonna start<br>here um<br>good evening ophthalmology is all about<br>vision and most of you will have at some<br>stage feasted on visually feasted on<br>masterpieces such as Rembrandt's<br>paintings and perhaps even this one<br>which is the blinding of Sanson the<br>story is told that Samson had invincible<br>powers and he told the secret of his<br>powers to his lover Delilah and that was<br>that his powers came from the fact that<br>his hair had never been cut since he was<br>born<br>Delilah betrayed him and told the<br>Philistines this secret and so you can<br>see from this picture Delilah running<br>away with his hair in the Philistines<br>pinning down Samson getting ready to<br>blind him now several questions can<br>emerge from this looking at this<br>painting the first could be why did<br>Delilah betray him but I would say the<br>more important question is why are they<br>blinding him why are they not cutting<br>off a leg or an arm or cutting out his<br>top tongue why are they choosing to<br>blind him and that is because they<br>wanted to inflict the greatest cruelty<br>upon him and blindness is considered to<br>be the greatest cruelty and in fact in<br>2016 when in the United States Chapman<br>University surveyed to look at what<br>Americans fear they found that they<br>feared several things<br>60% feared corrupt governments 41% fear<br>terrorist attacks 35% feared Obamacare<br>and 47% feared Lynas saying that it was<br>the worst possible health problem<br>someone could go through and when they<br>explored this further they found that<br>blindness was ranked as the most dreaded<br>health complaint worse than memory loss<br>of speech loss of a limb or contracting<br>HIV and AIDS and when they explored why<br>they said it was because blindness is<br>ciated with loss of Independence and<br>quality of life and certainly this is an<br>important issue as we age because visual<br>impairment increases as we age in fact<br>33% of visual impairment occurs over the<br>age of 65 and if you look at this graph<br>you'll see that the spike starts about<br>the age of 50 so what are the common<br>causes of blindness well there's<br>cataracts glaucoma diabetes and<br>age-related macular degeneration so what<br>I'd like to do in the next 10 to 12<br>minutes is give you a historical journey<br>through our understanding of vision and<br>then secondly to focus on some of the<br>research we have done at the University<br>of Otago Auckland one of the common<br>threads that goes through both both<br>things historically as well as our<br>research here at Auckland is that<br>research and progress is not made just<br>through advances in technology but it<br>requires fresh approaches and looking at<br>things with new eyes in the words of<br>Marcel Proust the real voyage of<br>discovery consists not in seeking new<br>landscapes but in having new eyes so the<br>research I'm presenting to you is part<br>of a team work and these are some of my<br>students who all four are now doctors<br>and three are ophthalmologists the<br>research I'm giving you is an an essence<br>of the work that's been published in<br>papers so if you would like more details<br>please let me know afterwards and I'll<br>be focusing on the optic nerve which is<br>my area of research and arguably the<br>most important aspect of the eye so the<br>optic nerve well initially they our<br>understanding of the optic nerve comes<br>from Galen and Galen thought that when<br>when someone wanted to see spiritual<br>humor was passed through the optic<br>nerves which he thought were hollow onto<br>what we wanted to look at and then the<br>soul returned this image into our mind<br>through the optic nerves again so we can<br>see and in fact this is where the<br>concept of the evil eye comes from so<br>therefore if the soul is looking upon<br>something evil the the evil humor is<br>then transmitted<br>to the person making them sick so the<br>optic nerve was thought to be halo a<br>hollow and then in the 1700s we had the<br>invention of the microscope and at that<br>stage despite looking at the optic nerve<br>through the microscope people who are<br>afraid to over turn Galen's theory<br>so despite seeing these little tubules<br>they still concluded that the tubules<br>were hollow allowing the flow of<br>spiritual humor and in fact it took a<br>medical student in 1755 who was brave<br>enough to go against current dogma at<br>the time and say that the these fibers<br>actually do not have a cavity inside<br>them and now we know that the optic<br>nerve is very much like a cable a<br>telephone cable or the wire that<br>connects your iPhone to the brain and<br>that it sends multiple millions of<br>messages through these little nerve<br>fibers connecting the eye to the brain<br>and here at the top you can see the<br>histology of the optic nerve and again<br>you can see the cable and see the<br>remarkable resemblance between the two<br>the next step came for us to be able to<br>look at the optic nerve in vivo or in<br>the actual person and this was happened<br>through the development of the<br>ophthalmoscope in the 1850s with the<br>development of the ophthalmoscope the<br>optic nerve became the only nerve in the<br>body that could be looked at under<br>physiological conditions so if a<br>neurosurgeon wants to see what they're<br>interested in they have to take out<br>their black and decker and drill a hole<br>through the skull well as<br>ophthalmologists all we have to do is<br>pick up the ophthalmoscope and we can<br>see the nerve in action in during life<br>and therefore we have developed many<br>different techniques and toys so that we<br>can actually look at the optic nerve in<br>three dimensions but the next challenge<br>came is how do we share what we're<br>actually looking at and this was<br>primarily done through these<br>sophisticated drawings which we would do<br>after we looked at the optic nerve and<br>of course you can I don't have to<br>explain to you the limitations of this<br>of these drawings so the next major<br>advance in ophthalmology came when to<br>photography met up<br>mala ji so that we can now take<br>photographs of the back of the eye and<br>here you can see a photograph of the<br>optic nerve and therefore we all knew<br>what we were looking at and we could<br>share our knowledge however it soon<br>became very clear that although we were<br>all looking at the same thing we all had<br>very different interpretations of what<br>we were looking at and this kind of<br>muddied a lot of the research that we<br>were doing in fact studies have shown<br>that ophthalmologists were correlated<br>with what they were looking at as well<br>as anglers who do who are describing the<br>same fish they caught and it really did<br>vary significantly from the very<br>different perspectives that you came<br>into things so the next challenge was<br>how do we measure objectively what we<br>can see subjectively in these pictures<br>and this is where laser technology now<br>meets ophthalmology and with that came<br>the new revolution and evolution of many<br>of the techniques that we now use in our<br>practice so one is the Heidelberg<br>retinal tomograph which is a scanning<br>laser camera which allows a<br>three-dimensional quantitative image of<br>the optic nerve from all 360 degrees the<br>other important technology is optical<br>coherence tomography and Oct as we call<br>it uses light waves very similar to<br>ultrasound using sound waves so it<br>allows us to look at and quantitatively<br>measure the thickness of the optic nerve<br>and here at the University of Auckland<br>we've been using these technologies for<br>various conditions<br>the first one is glaucoma glaucoma is<br>the leading cause of preventable<br>blindness it affects one out of every<br>ten adults over the age of 70 the visual<br>loss is silent until light in the<br>disease but once it occurs it's<br>irreversible it occurs because of a<br>problem with the drainage of fluid in<br>the front of the eye<br>and this results in a buildup of<br>pressure inside the eye this pressure is<br>then transmitted to the optic nerve and<br>then you see you get an excavation in<br>the head of the nerve and you can see<br>that normally there's a nice shallow<br>head to the optic nerve but with a<br>buildup of pressure you get loss of<br>nerve<br>tissue in this excavation that occurs as<br>this excavation occurs of the nerve you<br>start to lose your peripheral nerve<br>fibers first and the world becomes<br>darker dimmer and more constricted until<br>ultimately you're left with very little<br>vision left in glaucoma and this is an<br>example of the Oh CT scan that we now<br>can use and to analyze and evaluate<br>people with glaucoma and what you can<br>see up here are these black spots are<br>the blind spots that are determined by a<br>peripheral visual field test in someone<br>and you can see that with the O CT scan<br>we can measure microns of change in the<br>optic nerve so this is the head of the<br>optic nerve as we look at it and the<br>areas of red or abnormal areas or areas<br>where the tissue has been dropped out<br>and the areas of green or normal tissue<br>so now we can use this technology to<br>monitor people with glaucoma and<br>determine how they are deteriorating or<br>if they're stable and so here's an<br>example of a patient who has that<br>remember that hollowing that I described<br>to you and you can now look at the<br>quantitative hollowing that's we can now<br>measure and we can do this test every<br>time they come and overlap the optic<br>nerve on one visit from another and<br>exquisitely tell them whether their<br>treatment is accurate or where whether<br>it needs to be further intensified so<br>the advances in glaucoma meant with this<br>technology we can diagnose glaucoma<br>earlier we can identify deterioration<br>earlier and we can better differentiate<br>between glaucoma and other disease that<br>mimics it but glaucoma is not the only<br>area that we've used this technology<br>because you have to remember the optic<br>nerve is the back of the eye but it's<br>also the front of the brain so it allows<br>us to look at a window of what's<br>happening deep inside the brain and our<br>group here in Auckland was one of the<br>first to try to use the optic nerve as a<br>biomarker to see what's happening in<br>various neurodegenerative disorders and<br>the first group of patients we looked at<br>were patients with Alzheimer's disease<br>and this is a graph from our table from<br>our paper and you can see that<br>this here shows you the increase in the<br>size of the optic copper that excavation<br>that I spoke about or the loss of nerve<br>tissue<br>it's a surrogate for loss of nerve<br>tissue so you can see as you lose nerve<br>tissue in the optic nerve the mini<br>mental status examination which is the<br>score the severity of glaucoma the lower<br>the number the more the severity of the<br>Alzheimer's the lower the number the<br>more severe the disease you can see that<br>this is severity of Alzheimer's and<br>that's loss of tissues so the more nerve<br>tissue we were able to show the more<br>nerve tissue you lose in the optic nerve<br>correlates with the severity of the<br>Alzheimer's disease and this was the<br>first study that was able to show the<br>optic nerve can be used as a biomarker<br>for neurodegenerative disease since then<br>many investigators internationally have<br>also been looking at this in various<br>other conditions and in fact the FDA now<br>requires in multiple sclerosis for an<br>Oct scan to be done and all these<br>patients to help monitor disease with<br>any new treatments that are being<br>developed and here in Auckland we're<br>looking at Huntington's chorea<br>frontotemporal dementia and also brain<br>tumors in the role of OCT in these<br>studies so why brain tumors is because<br>brain tumors can cause blindness because<br>the optic nerve extends deep into the<br>brain and you can see from this yellow<br>diagram here those are the pathway<br>fibers of the optic nerve and their<br>extensions which extend all the way to<br>the back of the brain so a brain tumor<br>as you see in the other neuroimaging<br>slide does push on the optic nerve<br>fibers and can cause blindness so one<br>possible area we wanted to look at is<br>can we use this technology to predict if<br>someone is going to recover from their<br>vision after when they have a brain<br>tumor after they undergo surgery but<br>what we noticed and in fact it was<br>noticed internationally is if you look<br>back at this visual field test you can<br>see that all these black spots here are<br>someone's blind spots so they can't see<br>when they have all these blind spots but<br>look at the Oct it's green and you will<br>remember I told you that red<br>bad green is good so how can someone who<br>has this have to have this technology so<br>the traditional interpretation was the<br>the machine is limited the technology is<br>limited because it doesn't allow you to<br>interpret what's happening into the<br>brain but here in Auckland we looked at<br>it differently we said that maybe this<br>is a clue to whether the person is going<br>to recover or not and so in our paper<br>what we did is we correlated those who<br>recover from vision following surgery<br>with their Oct and we found that if they<br>have a healthy retinal nerve fiber layer<br>or an optic nerve prior to surgery as<br>measured by the Oct if they were blind<br>their chances of recovery were excellent<br>and you can see that's from these group<br>of patients here who recovered while<br>those who had a poor retinal nerve fiber<br>layer thickness and were blind didn't<br>change much in their post-operative<br>tests and therefore they didn't recover<br>so I will end with this 39 year old<br>woman who is 24 weeks pregnant because<br>she came in towards the end of the study<br>just as soon as we had made this<br>observation and so she had this some<br>significant tumor which and the question<br>was really whether she should have<br>surgery at 24 weeks pregnant or whether<br>she should wait and this was her Oct so<br>you can see it was a green so we<br>discussed with the neurosurgeons and we<br>said we think she's fine she has time<br>you can wait a few weeks and let the<br>baby developed because the optic nerve<br>fibers are not stressed so they waited<br>six weeks so the baby could be more<br>fully developed and then this is the<br>change in her vision that we saw after<br>her the surgery and then three months<br>afterwards she came into the<br>post-operative checked with a very<br>healthy baby and a very normal visual<br>field<br>so in conclusion longer life expectancy<br>is associated with greater needs and<br>maintaining quality of life and vision<br>is critical to maintaining this quality<br>of life technological advances in<br>ophthalmology<br>earlier diagnosis in more precise<br>management of conditions that occur in<br>Thank You Helen I'm sure again there'll<br>be many more questions for Helen and<br>once we conclude but we're now going to<br>our final speaker dr. our professor<br>Martin Connelly Martin trained in<br>medicine at newcastle upon tyne in the<br>UK and he qualified in 1980 he was for<br>15 years consultant physician at<br>Manchester Royal Infirmary and senior<br>lecturer in geriatric medicine at the<br>University of Manchester he was<br>appointed as freemasons professor of<br>geriatric medicine at Auckland and<br>geriatrician at white Amato dhb in 2006<br>Martin's research centers around<br>healthcare provision for older people<br>with emphasis on those living in<br>residential aged care and in retirement<br>village villages he has published over a<br>hundred and thirty peer-reviewed<br>original research papers and last month<br>he became a New Zealand citizen thank<br>you<br>I'm hoping that my voice will hold out<br>the consequences that sounds bad doesn't<br>it the prose and the consequences I'm<br>hoping to present are continue to<br>present an optimistically rather than a<br>pessimistic one it's a truth universally<br>acknowledged to the single man in<br>possession of a good fortune must be in<br>want of a wife first line of Pride and<br>Prejudice 1830 Jane Austen what's that<br>got to do with the democracy demography<br>of aging well quite a lot Jane died four<br>years later at the right young age of 41<br>great loss to English literature but as<br>you've already seen not particularly<br>epidemiologically surprising this line<br>that you've this graph that you've<br>already seen if you follow it further<br>back the plateaus and around about 41<br>from about 1817 backwards so 1817 the<br>average age of death in an in England<br>where Jane died was 41 so hope I'm not<br>going to insult people here hands up<br>please if you are 41 years old or<br>younger keep your hands up hands up<br>please if you're 42 years old or older<br>so everybody should now have their hands<br>up good kick now keep them up you know<br>keep put them down if you're in the<br>first group and you'll hope you die<br>before you 42 put them down if you're in<br>the second group and you wish you'd died<br>before you were 42 so you've also got<br>your hands up if you are in though is it<br>either of those groups and you have<br>concerns that demographic aging is a<br>problem you are the epidemiologic<br>equivalent to an in be not in my<br>backyard you know that sewerage running<br>through the streets is a bad thing but<br>you don't want a sewage farm next door<br>to your house you know that you think<br>that aging of the population might be<br>causing problems but you don't want to<br>die young you're an envy so am I I<br>therefore say to you is a tooth which<br>should be universally acknowledged that<br>the so-called demographic time bomb is<br>in fact man's greatest achievement<br>because nobody in this room wants to die<br>at 41 or younger<br>demographic time bomb<br>silver tsunami gray tsunami if you if<br>you google just those three terms you<br>get 90 million a bit Google hits is this<br>the object of giddy conspiracism and<br>internet myth-making<br>as Salman Seberg Montefiore said about<br>Jerusalem or are these legitimate<br>concerns before we go on to talk about<br>that just a few examples or people who<br>died young by today's standards in times<br>past think what they could have done had<br>they lived another 10 or 20 or 30 years<br>not longer and fewer examples of people<br>who did live a bit longer either by<br>their standards at the time or by modern<br>standards and did great things when they<br>were older so Churchill was war Prime<br>Minister until he was 71 and Nelson<br>Mandela who whose birth anniversary<br>hundredth anniversary was yesterday was<br>73 at the end of apartheid is that glass<br>half-empty or is it half full this is my<br>oldest son Robert with the glass half<br>empty or half full not as a beer glass<br>not a milk glass Roberts an engineer and<br>engineers would say is a glass tube our<br>society needs to be that's not a perfect<br>analogy but it does suggest that the<br>problem may not be quite as simple as<br>the glass heart being half full or half<br>empty if only it were UK tobacco tax in<br>2016 raised thirteen billion pounds when<br>70% of people smoked my working lifetime<br>as you've already heard tobacco tax is<br>equated at today's equivalent of 52<br>billion to smoking related health care<br>costs in the UK and those could cost and<br>the total healthcare cost now if you're<br>smoking related where it was 116 billion<br>in 2016 but also they saved pensions at<br>92 billion and social care costs at 17<br>billion because the age of death in<br>smokers in 1980 was 66 and the age of<br>death in the Irish population including<br>smokers was 75 now most people don't<br>smoke if they did won't have a problem<br>the modern equivalent is fat tax fat tax<br>has been brought in in the UK and<br>brought out again because everybody<br>hated it sugar tax has just been brought<br>in everybody hates that and that's<br>probably going to go we've not tried<br>salt tax yet<br>Rob so we should think about that one -<br>but it isn't simple I'm going to feel<br>quite a few slides from work that have<br>been done in my department by a team of<br>us many people in that team<br>I'd like to particular technology abroad<br>who was part of that team doctored you<br>abroad and she's present here today and<br>this is one of her slides the nub of the<br>problem of the number the perceived<br>problem is that as we get older the<br>number of chronic medical conditions<br>that we have gets greater so if when<br>you're 20 on average or 20 year olds on<br>average 80% of them have no chronic<br>conditions at all like happens on only<br>15% or less have one chronic condition<br>but with the time you get to eighty<br>fifteen percent of people have six or<br>more chronic conditions and less than<br>10% of not at all<br>we've heard I've heard a bit about<br>healthy lifespan versus on healthy<br>lifespan we've heard from Alice there in<br>terms of disability in dependency<br>another way of looking at healthy<br>lifespan and on healthy lifespan is<br>morbidity illnesses what symptoms and<br>the jury's out really whether whether in<br>terms of illnesses and symptoms as<br>opposed to dependency we are compressing<br>morbidity and in or dissipation of a<br>bunch of the details are looking at this<br>but there is so evidence in some country<br>this is UK data there's some evidence is<br>some countries that we are compressing<br>morbidity so we're having a longer life<br>span being healthy there's some evidence<br>of those countries that we're not but in<br>in any case in either country in any<br>country there's not a lot of movement in<br>terms of more in terms of compression or<br>mobility this is New Zealand data<br>understood that I was involved in and<br>this is a prevalence of the most common<br>medical conditions in very old people<br>80 to 90 year olds Maori and non-maori<br>in the North Island of New Zealand and<br>these are the conditions high blood<br>pressure and heart disease and heart<br>failure you know not they're pretty<br>nasty conditions that you wouldn't want<br>to have and these are the percentage of<br>people in each of these groups with them<br>so quite a lot of<br>I've quite a lot of morbidity note the<br>relatively low prevalence of dementia in<br>this very advanced age group talks a bit<br>more of that later<br>so another show of hands what proportion<br>of these very young people describe<br>their health as poor was it<br>hands up 50% was it 35% hands up<br>was it 20% was it 10% it was 7 to 8<br>percent and when you ask them to compare<br>that to people at their own age it was 1<br>to 2% and 45% of these people with all<br>these horrible symptomatic things longer<br>than said their health was good or<br>excellent and you may be surprised and<br>we were we weren't surprised because<br>this is replicated by lots of<br>international data that says the same<br>thing another study from Belgium<br>note I'm not biased they beat us in the<br>World Cup but I'm still going to talk<br>about their study this is 131 people<br>with the median age of 83 ranging from<br>80 to 90 years old who had been admitted<br>to the intensive care unit because they<br>were very sick and they'd not died and<br>they'd survived to be discharged from<br>hospital and they were surveyed three<br>months after discharging year after<br>discharges seven years after discharge<br>their one-year mortality was 50% and<br>their 17 mortality was 84% not<br>surprisingly because they were pretty<br>old and they've been very very sick they<br>should they themselves felt they were<br>their disability and dependency and<br>increased over time and indeed nearly<br>40% of them by the time we got to seven<br>years of the survivors were living in<br>restaurants or private hospitals there<br>was an overall decrease in quality of<br>life they told us all they told the<br>investigators as reported by them on a<br>validated and validated quality of life<br>scales<br>however quality of life was still<br>regarded as acceptable by all of them<br>2021 seven-year survivors were glad to<br>be alive<br>82% of one-year survivors and 72% of<br>seven-year survivors would say said if I<br>was sick again<br>I'd want to go back to ICU these are<br>very old people<br>remember the oldest was 97 that the time<br>they got to the 7 years so compression<br>or comorbidity might be a bridge to our<br>step too far should we be happy as all<br>the people seem to be with maintenance<br>of comorbidity I'm not saying we should<br>I'm just posing the question so ever our<br>chances we've been hearing about this<br>already of living to 85 or 90 we're life<br>expectancy at birth 78 for men and h2<br>for women in New Zealand is not the same<br>as life expectancy at 60 or 65 and<br>that's called the survivor effect so<br>this is slightly complicated slide these<br>are people of a certain age 70 or 75 or<br>95 this is how many life how many years<br>of life you've got left when you are 70<br>forget they will just look at the medium<br>color blue thing this is this is the<br>average the median so on average if<br>you're a man in New Zealand and you're<br>70 you can expect to live another 17.2<br>years but if you get to 85 15 years<br>later you know can't expect in there was<br>another 2.2 years you live expecting the<br>living with 5.5 years and it goes on<br>goes on goes on so theoretically<br>mathematically we all live forever but<br>it's not quite as simple as though<br>but that's that's that's the survivor<br>effect and we've already heard we've<br>already seen this from Alistair in a non<br>graphical form most of that increased<br>expectations expectations of longevity<br>currently is in older people so you<br>don't stand much chat much much greater<br>chance of making it to 65 then you then<br>your contemporary or your people 50<br>years old about as did 50 years ago but<br>if you make it to 65 you stand a much<br>greater chance of living to 75 or 85 or<br>95 so it really is all these older<br>people that are living longer this is a<br>very recent story just published this<br>year that shows that if you get beyond a<br>hundred your chances of dying in the<br>next year or less than the chances of an<br>average 90 year old dying in the next<br>year these are super survivors these are<br>the really hyper fit people that make it<br>200 under suppose it now you've all<br>heard there's a very major<br>socio-economic effect so my daughter<br>here is 28 from a high socio-economic<br>group stands a better than 50 check<br>50-50 chance of living to 90 and my<br>granddaughter her niece who is three now<br>chosen three then are also from a higher<br>socioeconomic groups that's a better<br>than 50/50 chance of living to 95 what<br>improvements do come with potential<br>problems and like to introduce the term<br>dependency ratio to you this is a<br>well-recognized international term note<br>the loaded terminology dependency the<br>dependency ratio is for every hundred<br>people in the population aged 15 to 64<br>which are said to be the productive<br>people how many dependent people are<br>there how many kids under 15 and how<br>many adults over 65 and I just like to<br>talk about the adults over 65 so<br>currently in New Zealand for every 100<br>people aged 15 to 20 to age 15 to 64<br>there are 23 people over 65 but by the<br>way in the working life some of our<br>current medical students that number<br>will have double so there'll be 45<br>roughly over 65 year olds for every<br>but how they're really dependent in New<br>Zealand or 35% of over 60 of average and<br>paid work and 20% do voluntary work the<br>net intergenerational transfer older to<br>younger of money does not reverse until<br>the older generation gets to 82 so why<br>because we we older people give our kids<br>deposits for their houses or loan them<br>and do we expect to get it back well<br>perhaps we do perhaps we're done and we<br>look after their kids for free we look<br>after our grandchildren babysitting for<br>free etc and we've paid their student<br>loans off to pay the university fees and<br>we don't expect to get that back either<br>90% of the caring of so-called dependent<br>and these people are dependent oh very<br>old people is carried out by their<br>families so there may be dependent but<br>it depended on the state and 50 percent<br>of that is carried out by their spouses<br>so there may be dependent but they're<br>not dependent on the younger generation<br>so there's lots of boots in the term<br>dependency ratio however what is what is<br>not a but is that the number of acute<br>medical medical hospitalizations medical<br>and surgical hospitalizations on expect<br>it or not mean you go in for your<br>routinely expected operation the number<br>of acute unexpected operations in the<br>over 85 this is the redline has doubled<br>in a relatively short period of time<br>this is the northern region the for<br>northern DHBs from Northland down to<br>Counties Manukau and for every one<br>person that was admitted to hospital is<br>an emergency I see over 85 in 1999 there<br>were just over two people admitted in<br>2009 eleven years later New Zealand is<br>very generous when it comes to<br>healthcare expenditure is very old this<br>is your healthcare expenditure this<br>slavi old data for every dollar New<br>Zealand spends on health care of people<br>under the age of 65 it spends six<br>dollars on people over the age of 75 and<br>in relative terms that's the highest in<br>the OECD even higher than the states for<br>example and a mahtim line is we spend<br>forty-one percent of our public health<br>expenditure on the 15% of the population<br>currently 65 and over oh it doesn't<br>sound good does it when we're gonna get<br>lots more people age department over<br>well<br>here's the good news guys what this<br>actually equates to is that we use most<br>of our personal health care severe<br>expenditure in the last year or two of<br>our lives<br>trying to keep us alive at whatever age<br>we die so if you die at 41 you use most<br>of them your personal lifetime<br>healthcare expenditure between the age<br>of 39 and 41 if you died 100 199 201 and<br>beyond a certain age and that age<br>depends on the jurisdiction where you're<br>living the older we are when we die the<br>less is up to us actual money is spent<br>on us trying to keep us alive so this is<br>the EU and this is increasing age and<br>this is money spent trying to keep<br>people alive the total lifetime<br>healthcare expenditure as you see it<br>drops at about 87 that's here you what<br>four countries it's 85 others it's 89<br>but it's it's it falls off so it's<br>cheaper for health care for people to<br>live longer not for everything get the<br>health care further problems in the<br>future the medical advances more can be<br>done more should be done new or<br>degenerations have increased the<br>expectations anyway further reductions<br>in ageism will increase cost further so<br>when I was a registrar in 1990 if you<br>were 66 and you had a heart attack you<br>couldn't go to coronary care you were<br>too old if you were 66 and your kidneys<br>failed and you need any renal dialysis<br>tough you were too old that's what I<br>mean by Ages in health care we don't<br>have that now but we still have some so<br>I explained all this to my smart one of<br>my my older son got my kids in Tuesday<br>um who was just Simon he was then aged<br>11 he's now 22 and six-foot-two and<br>hates me showing this slide and I<br>explained in slightly simple terms and I<br>said so Simon what do we think for the<br>future and that was his answer<br>I think he was wrong we don't know what<br>we don't know when we don't know it so<br>this is a map of the world in 1750 very<br>accurate but we knew about big missing<br>they're missing lot missing<br>this isn't wrap up with world course<br>drawn in Europe this is the role<br>Victorian for murray in newcastle upon<br>tyne where I train pavilion ward the<br>waters called pavilion Warren this is<br>1911 I was not on it I'm not in the<br>picture that is not me it looked a bit<br>like that in 1981 I worked there but it<br>doesn't look like that now hospital<br>wards do not look like this anymore<br>medical care is advancing and it always<br>has I love this quote this is the first<br>time anybody in the world that we know<br>of ever said that doing research is a<br>there's another one of your broad slides<br>as how many people in New Zealand are<br>living in residential aged care what are<br>your chances of living in resins and<br>private hospitals as your age well one<br>way of measuring that very accurate way<br>is where you are physically located do<br>you graphically locate it at the time<br>that you die and in New Zealand if you<br>die over the age of 85 there's a 55%<br>chance that you are physically<br>geographically in a rest home or a<br>private hospital when you die we're only<br>just overtaken by Iceland on though that<br>table on that graph and this you could<br>see in other OECD of course is a wide<br>range usually lose very good at<br>institutionalizing it's older people but<br>it's getting better so this is another<br>study that I was involved in with an<br>including Joe but many learnt many other<br>people on this study we were involved in<br>this one 2008 this is the opal study and<br>this is greater or klonda through your<br>plan DHBs these are this is happens to<br>be for people aged over here over the<br>age of 85 below the age of 94 so for<br>every hundred people in Greater Auckland<br>in that age group in 1988<br>43 of them if the women lived in a<br>restaurant or private hospital by 2008<br>had fallen to 27<br>same for men same for other age groups<br>only showing the one slide busy slide<br>but just look at this line here this is<br>the actual number of rest home and<br>private hospital places available in<br>those four years spread over 20 years no<br>change despite the fact that they've<br>been a 43% increase in the population<br>over the age of 65 people were older<br>living in residential aged care and they<br>were more disabled so they were less<br>mobile and there are many more drugs<br>than there had been 20 years ago here's<br>all that a bad thing<br>well no residents renting residential<br>aged-care later in life and only when<br>they were more disabled they were<br>staying independent to their own homes<br>were longer and that's where they want<br>to be and they're also not occupying<br>hospital beds so this is the time they<br>entered residential aged-care for the<br>foot on the first day they entered<br>residential aged-care this is a year<br>before huh before that time is a year<br>after that time this is the chances of<br>acute hospitalization each of the docs<br>represents a week and as you can see<br>increasing chance that last six months<br>before they are moving to a rest home a<br>private hospital as soon as they enter<br>trans drops offer off a cliff so it<br>isn't all these old people in rest homes<br>that are blocking the medical beds in<br>hospitals pensions Bismarck Germany New<br>Zealand ten years later UK ten years<br>after that UK pension in current terms<br>then was thirty dollars a week and it<br>was given to those over 65 when the<br>average age of death was 59 not when<br>people got a pension<br>if we were equally gendered equally<br>generous as UK liberals 100 years ago<br>would start to pay pensions in about 90<br>not a great idea but even a slide today<br>increase in the pension age is not gonna<br>be very popular and probably not very<br>fair to manual workers but pensions take<br>up a very high proportion of spending on<br>older people how is he not keepin see<br>has fallen in New Zealand quite<br>dramatically it's not fallen as much in<br>older people but it has fallen in<br>younger older people not in the very old<br>as yet why is that relevant because the<br>amount of pension that New Zealand and<br>any other country pays to people older<br>people is mitigate is affected by the<br>assumption that they don't have to pay<br>rent because they own their own homes<br>they don't have no mortgage because they<br>paid it off and in fact that's less<br>likely to be true<br>pensions arising anyway even in the<br>crash there is a current transfer of<br>family capital to the state in the<br>private sector who retire mobility is<br>ongoing - why and some people have to<br>pay rest up on property hospital costs<br>unless resentment is arisen in younger<br>generations where's all the money going<br>we you got free education we have to pay<br>for it but all the people have paid<br>their taxes in their superannuation for<br>a long time and those taxes and<br>superannuation have actually built up<br>the healthcare system and the social<br>care system that we currently have these<br>things do not happen straight away<br>overnight<br>so a reasonable question might be do we<br>agree with Margaret Thatcher who said in<br>1980 there is no such thing as society I<br>very rarely find myself agreeing with<br>Margaret Thatcher but I hear you ask<br>what about dementia well you've already<br>heard opened so I won't do the show of<br>hands because you know the answer this<br>is this is the actual data from that<br>from the stories that Alistair was<br>referring to two studies both published<br>research about publishers it was one<br>paper in The Lancet in 2013 data from<br>the UK the prevalence of dementia in 85<br>to 89 year 85 to 90 rolls essentially 20<br>years to 25 years ago was worth 20% in<br>men uninformed a 30 percent 13 percent<br>20 years later and in women it was 27%<br>and had fallen through 18 percent<br>two years later that was a massive fault<br>it's a 35% fall in the age-specific<br>prevalence of dementia in that period in<br>the UK why might that be<br>we've heard various reasons why that<br>might be but an important reason is the<br>fall in vascular risk smoking high blood<br>pressure clogged control of cholesterol<br>reducing the risk of stroke and heart<br>disease but also reducing the risk of<br>vascular dementia 25% of dementia at you<br>we think or what used to think to lots<br>of little mini strokes impairing brain<br>function but if it's only 25% retention<br>that's caused by that even if you<br>eliminate all of it how can you get a<br>35% reduction in the prevalence<br>adventure well we now think that<br>Alzheimer's disease in order to become<br>manifest doesn't just need those<br>proteins that you're hearing about<br>earlier on to be deposited in the brain<br>yes it needs those before you get out<br>services ease but it also needs we think<br>and your unhealthy arterial blood supply<br>to the brain so if you eliminate or<br>reduce vascular risk you also reduce<br>Alzheimer's disease risk if so that<br>again as we've already heard there were<br>some concerns in the future regarding<br>obesity and diabetes and vascular risk<br>so evolution vs. revolution so mapping<br>Europe and mapping Africa was evolution<br>happen gradually Europeans finding this<br>bit of the world who was revolution<br>Europeans finding this bit of the world<br>whose revolution Fleming found in<br>penicillin was revolution William Diller<br>Fleming when it comes to ourselves<br>disease we can't do it all with<br>evolution it's probable increasingly<br>likely that motion that many of us would<br>live to be a hundred or possibly our<br>kids or our grandkids 110
