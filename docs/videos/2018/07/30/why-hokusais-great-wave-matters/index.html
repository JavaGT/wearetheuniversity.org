no my Heidi my<br>toady my Amy Amy Amy he tena koutou<br>katoa<br>I am so honored to introduce David Bell<br>professor David Bell from the University<br>of Otago College of Education for his<br>inaugural professorial lecture on why<br>hooks eyes great wave matters as you<br>might expect David has a most impressive<br>academic record he earned his PhD in<br>2003 only three years after earning a PG<br>departs with distinction in art history<br>in theory which was just 30 years after<br>completing his BA in history art history<br>and theory all from the University of<br>Otago David also holds a diploma in<br>teaching from the Christchurch College<br>of Education was awarded in 1975 and a<br>diploma in Fine Arts from the School of<br>Art at Otago Polytechnic completed in<br>1973 through the years David has arisen<br>through the ranks beginning with a post<br>as a teacher of Visual Arts at Hornby<br>High School in Christchurch<br>he has been head of the art department<br>at King's high school here in Dunedin<br>and for the former Dunedin College of<br>Education and the coordinator of<br>postgraduate programs for the University<br>of Otago College of Education his<br>impressive research record dedication as<br>a teacher and supervisor talent in his<br>field and outstanding service record are<br>well known and far too much to tell you<br>about in this brief introduction so here<br>are just a few highlights David's<br>research is primarily in the field of<br>art education and aesthetic learning<br>both in the classroom and<br>settings such as museums he's recognized<br>internationally as an expert in<br>substantive aesthetics and in Japanese<br>visual field in particular with Akio a<br>most recently David was awarded a major<br>contract with teh Papa Tongarewa<br>to evaluate the henna Torah learning<br>laboratory at Te Papa as evidence of<br>David's excellence in teaching he has<br>been nominated for the past three years<br>for an Otago University Student<br>Association excellence in Teaching Award<br>David's research record is equally<br>impressive he has published five solo<br>third books ten book chapters with<br>another accepted thirty-six refereed<br>journal articles 26 book reviews and<br>review articles and 14 refereed<br>conference proceedings he is a popular<br>presenter at conferences both in New<br>Zealand and internationally has given<br>just under three dozen public lectures<br>and has curated five exhibitions and one<br>catalog David is also a leader to give<br>you just a flavour of his leadership<br>activities David has

Otago<br>kid<br>society so that's the official professor<br>David Bell but I want to tell you a few<br>things that you're not going to find on<br>his CV David's love of the Arts it's<br>surpassed by his love of family and it's<br>so lovely to see so many of his family<br>here tonight David is one of the best<br>listeners on the planet David is always<br>there to lend a shoulder to anyone going<br>through a rough time David always puts<br>his hand up to help enthusiastically and<br>I can tell you I greatly appreciated<br>that when I was Dean of the College of<br>Education and there were some shall we<br>say less than appealing tasks that had<br>to be done David can be counted on to be<br>the voice of reason in a Hui especially<br>when things start to go to custard I am<br>convinced that David knows everyone in<br>the field of education certainly in<br>Dunedin David can explain anything to<br>anyone in such a way that you cannot<br>help but understand I've supervised at<br>the doctoral level with David and his<br>expertise in explaining qualitative<br>research methods is nothing short of<br>incredible and I will never forget God<br>tending one of his lectures on the parts<br>of Amer I the farinelli and protocol for<br>a visit to Amer I I was not new to New<br>Zealand but for the first time I truly<br>understood the why underpinning the what<br>David loves to travel and in his travels<br>he engages in a star quest not to see<br>celebrities not to look at the heavens<br>from different locations and not to<br>discover new talent no David searches<br>for Michelin star restaurants and then<br>he rates the food and the ambiance and<br>finally David knows the value of having<br>a wee dram of the good stuff on occasion<br>and David I think this qualifies as one<br>of those occasions so please join me in<br>welcoming professor David Dell our<br>Renaissance man outstanding scholar<br>brilliant teacher magnificent colleague<br>and my dear friend tena koutou tena<br>koutou tena koutou katoa<br>we're going I think we are thank you<br>very much<br>gosh if this place folds there's a<br>future for your both and fiction thank<br>you both very much and thank you to<br>everyone for coming tonight it's a real<br>privilege to be and work and and and<br>share in the community of a place like<br>this occasions like this though sort of<br>turn privilege into intimidation so I<br>may have kept a couple of times I would<br>like to start in fact by thanking people<br>not just for coming here but one of the<br>things I realized when I reflected on<br>where my research and my teaching<br>because they'd intermesh<br>quite closely in my mind at least where<br>they've come from and it occurred to me<br>as I pondered on this that in fact it<br>doesn't actually emanate from me at all<br>it's really the outcome of the<br>relationships I've been pleased to enjoy<br>over the last 40 odd years and the<br>profession both as a teacher as a<br>teacher on the old College of Education<br>as a teacher here in the university so<br>so the first thing I want to acknowledge<br>is that research and teaching and<br>learning sort of a synthesis they don't<br>occur separately and in in my life at<br>least or at least in my head my research<br>pathway such as it is is quite<br>unconventional I think it's toddler got<br>off to a very good start in year 13 when<br>one of my teachers actually gave me a<br>diary that he had carefully transcribed<br>from the original and the Hakan one of<br>the early settlers on the peninsula and<br>he said analyze this he didn't tell me<br>how to analyze this and he didn't<br>actually explain to me what analysis was<br>he just left me to it and it was an<br>object listen I think a little voyage of<br>discovery in which I began by by putting<br>it off as I did regularly when I was 16<br>17 18 19 but I got to it eventually and<br>when I started reading this diary I<br>found the most astonishing synthesis of<br>a life of someone who had stepped off<br>one of the very first boats to arrive<br>here at Otago having bought a piece of<br>land off a map that seemed to indicate<br>that it might be flat pasture land it<br>purchased the other side of the harbour<br>cone and he had purchased in fact what<br>really amounts to a cliff face of dense<br>bush and hard rock and what I found as I<br>worked my way through this is that there<br>were different kinds of information<br>there different clues he had kept a fess<br>studious account of every penny he had<br>spent every penny that it cost to run<br>his home as well as the farming business<br>the only income he actually made really<br>was the income he made moonlighting<br>across the the hill at Cal annex Castle<br>as it was being built and as I started<br>to analyze the figures I started to have<br>to find this human story underneath a<br>really engaging human story of hardship<br>endeavor and resilience and what I<br>didn't know then and what I now know is<br>that I was learning the hard way how to<br>do quant and qual a valuations of<br>evidence the the ingredients that that<br>really add up to research sadly I<br>squandered that knowledge in my first<br>years at university were entertaining<br>enriching and a total and complete<br>failure I think I'm possibly the only<br>person in this room to have not one but<br>two if failures in the first two years<br>of study<br>side-by disappeared there may be more<br>and what I did was I eventually became<br>an art teacher and i reaiiy have enjoyed<br>nothing more than teaching art for the<br>40 years since then but as I sort of<br>developed my teaching I discovered other<br>things the first of which was that<br>learning and practicing and teaching and<br>learning an art are themselves a<br>research process it's an iterative<br>pathway in which we we engage in sort of<br>a long-term development of ideas and and<br>imagery and then I was lucky enough<br>during my I think 16 15 Thor sixteenth<br>year at King's high school to get a<br>teaching fellowship I was housed in what<br>was then the Soviet Studies department<br>between Mikhail Gorbachev and my own<br>sort of need to get back to work that<br>dissolved at exactly the same time as<br>the Soviet Union I then was lucky enough<br>five years later to have a teaching<br>study award which allowed me to be a<br>student full-time for a year and the the<br>two of those experiences I think really<br>crystallized my engagement with the<br>interface between teaching and research<br>and my desire to sort of move into a<br>setting in which the two could<br>complement one another in richer ways if<br>I could so I came to work at the college<br>and subsequently I've developed and into<br>interface between three different<br>research interests and that's possibly<br>unusual I think most of us really<br>research intensely a field and then<br>perhaps develop and move on but really<br>the key focus for me is the first of<br>these<br>I've been really fortunate as a child to<br>grow up in an era in which New Zealand<br>lived the world and outage of visual<br>arts education for 30 years under the<br>auspices of the Tobii scheme primary art<br>education and advisory services<br>flourished in this country and really<br>worth the envy of many nations around<br>the world as I grew a little older<br>things started to change certainly from<br>when I when I started at the College<br>within the first year of college the<br>ministry decided to cut funding for<br>teacher training by 25 percent the<br>four-year degree became a three year<br>degree and at the same time we've had a<br>development of changes in curriculum<br>that have embraced way more than a focus<br>on making art which would have been for<br>decades before then since 1876 of them<br>the thing that really engaged me was the<br>opportunity to teach not just how to<br>make art but how to understand it how to<br>engage with it the world that comes from<br>the worlds that belongs to the people<br>who it's for and what it means to them<br>and that's been a really enriching<br>experience and that I think is the thing<br>that has enriched our education in New<br>Zealand since 1989 the other side of the<br>coin is that preparation for teaching<br>and support services for teaching have<br>shrunk incremental II since that time<br>and we now have levels of engagement<br>that really are no better than they were<br>at the late 19th century and what we've<br>discovered in visual arts at least is<br>that teachers are having to turn to new<br>directions to find ways of learning<br>ways of teaching and learning in these<br>areas of what I'd sort of very broadly<br>cooked aesthetic learning<br>and one of the places they've gone to is<br>cultural institutions or museums and<br>I've written and they're very broader<br>since and one of the reasons they've<br>gone there is that in many museums we<br>have outstanding educators who provide<br>new approaches new visions for teachers<br>and young people going in with them and<br>learning with objects meeting artworks<br>at first hand handling objects and with<br>it where it's appropriate and and<br>learning about different or through<br>different kinds of of evidence so they<br>are really the two phenomena that have<br>molded my approach to research and now<br>my teaching in art education the<br>question I'm always asked is David<br>why're you are you interested the word<br>they usually uses obsessed with Japanese<br>visual culture and the odd thing here is<br>that in fact this is the thing that came<br>much later I was interested in other<br>cultures because my grandmother was<br>brought up in India until she was almost<br>20 and her house had Banaras ware and<br>various other things that she bought out<br>when she'd immigrated to New Zealand<br>there I think so the seed of interest in<br>diverse cultures and the way they can be<br>embraced into my research my learning<br>but there was a couple of little<br>landmark points where things started to<br>crystallize about Japanese art and one<br>of them came in the last Saturday of<br>September 1981 we held and I came we got<br>a job in Dunedin and we came down to<br>look for a house and we were taken up to<br>see a house in Kim you a road and I<br>remember quite vividly walking into this<br>house that had the three things that I<br>could not do without in 1981 it had ever<br>kado green shag pile carpet<br>it had a conversation pit and it had as<br>you walked into the bathroom you started<br>in a sea of blues and greens of whites<br>and as you walk around and into the<br>shower the wave that the dragon's claw<br>foam of hockey sized great wave crested<br>above your head directly above the<br>shower eyes we went straight out we made<br>the estate agent phoned it in to the<br>office we had missed out on the house<br>for four by four minutes it's possibly a<br>blessing I have no idea to this day how<br>many bedrooms at had and I really don't<br>care and it wasn't until sometime after<br>that that I started to ponder on this<br>picture what had actually struck me<br>about it was not just the fact that it<br>was a pretty cool bathroom for 1981 but<br>the fact that here was a picture that<br>everyone seemed to know a picture about<br>we verging on universal significance why<br>well by that stage had achieved an<br>international current currency in a<br>transcultural one it's I don't know<br>whether you've noticed but it's on the<br>Fijian coinage I don't know whether<br>you've noticed but the wave has been a<br>guest on the map it's twice you may not<br>have noticed this but it is the only<br>artwork in history to become an emoji<br>and in addition to that it is image of<br>the rising tide of defiance and Ulster<br>street art it's an it's one of the hunt<br>British Museum's hundreds most important<br>objects in the world and in particular<br>and perhaps most poignant ly I think on<br>the coast of Rhode Island<br>a rising flock of gulls 230 commemorate<br>the lives of everyone lost on TWA flight<br>in 1996 and in fact that poignant is<br>something that I think and appends the<br>significance of this work for its<br>original audiences caucus I lived in the<br>city of adore it all's the town we known<br>in our know as as Tokyo and by his<br>lifetime it had grown to be the most<br>populous city in the world and one of<br>the most well educated there was a huge<br>hunger for works of art like this this<br>is called an ukyo a a floating world<br>picture and it catered to the interests<br>of people with a particularly<br>middle-class people who had effluence<br>and a desire to enjoy life to the full<br>and at some was one of the things they<br>enjoyed the most in 1833 when they<br>looked at this picture what would they<br>have seen well interestingly they would<br>have seen things that aren't actually in<br>the picture<br>this is a picture from above the waters<br>of the cigar of Sagami Bay looking<br>northwards towards Kanagawa Prefecture<br>and to the east behind the wave on the<br>right they would have known there was<br>the town of Kamakura the town that has<br>rich cultural significance in Japan site<br>of shrines temples brothels run by the<br>shrines as their primary source of<br>income and it was also the place where<br>the bakufu the military government of<br>the Shogun's was really crystallized<br>from the Left Behind the wave itself<br>high coney which is a town of bath<br>houses onsen town well known for its<br>entertainments a tower and much<br>celebrated for its wide views across the<br>Kanto and stretching between them and<br>between Edo and today's court or the<br>tork I do highly significant route<br>between the old city of the Emperor<br>and the new city of the Shogun's so this<br>is a picture that in which they would<br>have seen some historical significance<br>they also would have seen a much richer<br>significance that we share with them the<br>fact that in Japan nothing is as close<br>to daily experience as the meeting<br>between pearl and and see the margins if<br>you like between land travel settlement<br>existence and this key root for both<br>shipping and for fishing the waters in<br>the the Inland Sea were in places<br>extremely dangerous the affect commented<br>on by people like dr. thomas holland<br>people like the troubie Kings when they<br>traveled there recorded the the<br>difficult passages in their Diaries and<br>what we now know is that in fact lives<br>were lost quite frequently on those seas<br>so for hockey sized public this was an<br>image of the frailty of human life human<br>existence in relation to the power of<br>nature it's not an image of the sublime<br>in the European sense Japanese<br>sensibilities are occupy quite different<br>territories but it is an image of<br>ephemerality which is a recurrent theme<br>in Japanese as now all of this is<br>interesting for me but it's also just a<br>little ironic it's ironic on two levels<br>in the first instance this isn't a<br>picture of a wave at all this is<br>actually a picture of a mountain in the<br>mountains Fuji and this is one of our<br>somewhere between two and three hundred<br>images of Fuji that he did in the second<br>instance this is neither a typical<br>Japanese picture though ironically again<br>it is hokusai as the one artist that<br>every Japanese school student knows and<br>this is the one picture that are almost<br>certain to see in<br>it's in the textbooks and it's the only<br>artist in the textbook so we we have<br>this have the sort of sustain currency<br>but in fact haka sided 22,000 purchase<br>in his work in his life he also wrote<br>and published twenty two hundred and<br>forty books and between all of that this<br>subject occupies some two hundred and<br>forty<br>the second major way website there are<br>two dimensions of that of that unusual<br>quality during hockey size time an<br>artist trained to do one subject and one<br>subject only a specialist at his day<br>might focus on images of actors and do<br>nothing else for the entire professional<br>career he engaged in every single<br>subject that was available to him and he<br>did more than that he would do anything<br>he did sweet wrappers for the local shop<br>he it's that it's the historical<br>equivalent of doing designing Jimmy's<br>buy bags and what's interesting here is<br>that he was equally successful in every<br>single domain it's only history a bird<br>and in particular American Historians<br>that have documented him as a specialist<br>and landscapes and much celebrated for<br>Fuji that very feature made him unusual<br>he was known as the word that would be<br>used in was kijun or crazy person he<br>really was eccentric in every sense and<br>I chose this picture to illustrate that<br>because in his original biography<br>written just a couple of years after his<br>death in Japan the first six pages of<br>chapter two are devoted entirely to<br>accounts of a drunkenness so completely<br>he was sober some of the time he had to<br>get the work<br>the second thing that's quite unusual<br>about occupy is a gain every artist<br>trained January through a five six seven<br>year apprenticeship exercise<br>apprenticeship last of somewhere between<br>30 and 34 years<br>he didn't produce works that he was<br>personally satisfied with until his mid<br>seventies and he told us so in a number<br>of documents what's interesting is he<br>started the first apprenticeship at age<br>eleven age thirteen he'd be hid hunted<br>into the leading studio of his day the<br>cats at our studio<br>he was precocious his master was called<br>katsu cohosh and Shah so just as he<br>reached the age of fifteen a Kasai<br>christened Ansari christened himself<br>shun raw spring brilliance as against<br>spring brightness for his master's name<br>so his ego his ego costume leadership of<br>the school when his master died but as<br>you can see he went on to study in a<br>whole range of other domains the other<br>thing that I think we need to<br>acknowledge here is that Fuji itself had<br>rich significance in Japanese cultural<br>context particularly in it all it was a<br>live volcano at last erupted in<br>seventeen hundred and seven the view you<br>have here as and a century later over a<br>century later the view you have in Japan<br>Travel board posters as this one the<br>other side has a crater about the size<br>of this campus and a new mountain that<br>was formed in 1707 its characters Fuji<br>means not equal<br>peerless there is no other mountain<br>equal to this it is the highest mountain<br>in Japan and this the symmetry and it's<br>perfect curves into that that status in<br>Taoist history's the characters are<br>often read as fou shoe<br>not death and Fuji the mountain has<br>associations with immortality that date<br>at the very least back to the 3rd<br>century encapsulated in the story of the<br>Isles of the Blessed where the Chinese<br>emperor since the emissaries to see<br>cross the sea to the islands of the<br>blest two climates highest mountains to<br>to to bring back the elixir of life now<br>that myth reconstructs itself into<br>Japanese cultural context again and<br>again again it's most celebrated in<br>taketori monogatari the tale of the<br>Bamboo Cutter and the moon made the moon<br>maiden being that baby that he found<br>lying and the rushes and raised and<br>eventually returns to the moon it's<br>celebrated and classical drama<br>Fujisan sister fuji fuji has her own<br>goddess singing die by abdul bosatsu who<br>is a woman and what's interesting about<br>that is that in order to gain access<br>entry to the pure land after death<br>Yamaguchi mountain ascetics would climb<br>Mount Fuji and and that would be their<br>reward in the afterlife and that became<br>a popular pastime for children the the<br>citizens of it all at the time sadly<br>less than half of them woman weren't<br>allowed to climb the mountain which<br>meant that they weren't allowed access<br>to the Pure Land farsighted people<br>compensated and in in hockey size day<br>they built many Fugees at one stage<br>through 8 built and constructed in<br>different parts of the city for woman to<br>climb and thus gain their entry to an<br>afterlife I think the other thing here<br>that we should acknowledge us that<br>there's a very playful side to these<br>works and I didn't mention it until now<br>because we need to see though<br>whole picture but Fugees profile here is<br>repeated in the foreground and these<br>curving holes of the boats and then it's<br>asymmetric a symmetrical peak has<br>reconstructed here right and the<br>foreground what's interesting is that in<br>the 36 of views of Fuji which a there<br>are 46 in the series clearly it was very<br>popular and in the hundred views of Fuji<br>later in the 36 in particular that play<br>that visual play occurs in all but two<br>of the images that he composed we can<br>see this notion of visual players as it<br>sort of develops through his career to<br>the Great Wave has presidents this is<br>the earliest one this is a picture of a<br>group of Trevor a traveler on the left<br>and a group who are visiting the beach<br>in on the island in Oshima<br>it's a may show a as a pictures of the<br>mountain a a famous place picture and we<br>know that pictures of rough seas were<br>quite popular<br>this one doesn't represent a sort of<br>nascent tsunami or giant wave it's<br>actually a sort of a very graphic<br>description of a spring tide very high<br>tide the kind that we now call a king<br>tides that are thundering against the<br>walls of Sinclair yes Bernard at<br>precisely 5:30 every morning at the<br>moment he developed and returned to this<br>theme again and again and again this<br>time a new European style you see at the<br>top right here he's he's engaged the<br>European copper plate style for his<br>Japanese character writings completely<br>illegible as a result but he was he was<br>doing everything he could to engage with<br>this whole new cultural context he<br>reproduces it again in this image of the<br>suicide of a loyal servant here we start<br>to see some undercurrents<br>of significance of this wave both as the<br>overwhelming tide of pain as he plunges<br>his sword into his abdomen but at the<br>same time in Shinto terms in particular<br>in terms of the cleansing power of the<br>water and the wave as it crashes upon<br>the rocks the image of it so hungee and<br>his lover here on the rocks as a<br>reminder also of something else<br>something that's a light motif and<br>Hokusai's later works and that something<br>else is the ephemerality of life of<br>youth and beauty and that repeats itself<br>from the very early Heian period the<br>medieval period in Japanese history in<br>the notion of sensibility called mono no<br>aware a Hawaii is a sense of pathos the<br>underlying pathos of all things with the<br>third 46 views of the 36 views of Fuji<br>he again developed a more more compact<br>course of of graphic play and each one<br>he plays the same games we can see here<br>the profile of Fuji echoed and the the<br>theory here the cargo-boat here and then<br>and the upturned menon bridge mannan<br>Bashi across the river here as it enters<br>the Sumida River and again this is a<br>sort of a synthesis of both<br>western-style art it's in perspective<br>but also of traditional Japanese forms<br>unit or a Japanese pictures recorded<br>images of daily life than my new di<br>little little images of people fishing<br>the fire towers that were scattered<br>around the city to save it in times of<br>fire it all burned down regularly here<br>the European impact is quite different<br>it's in the adoption of the color that<br>he knew as barren blue or Berlin blue<br>the color we know as pratham blue which<br>had only<br>just been allowed for common use by the<br>authorities that have been around for a<br>while but it all was a very tightly<br>regulated society and again we can see<br>here the profile of Fuji moving up here<br>and down here and here are much more<br>subtle repetition between the slope and<br>this boat there's another theme starts<br>to emerge through these works what's<br>really interesting about Haku sires that<br>although he traveled a lot<br>perhaps unusually for his age he lived<br>in the city and the city was intensely<br>populated was teeming with life it was a<br>difficult city to move in and in many<br>ways but he in these late years in<br>particular very really ever depicted<br>anything from the city he focused on the<br>hinterlands he focused on the way Japan<br>had looked in the past he folk not not<br>politically not not with images of<br>castles or famous landmarks but with<br>very very simple views of everyday life<br>that notion of art compounding with<br>ordinariness is very much a trope in<br>many areas of Japanese art while beasts<br>are bees the term that many people will<br>have engaged with and that really<br>informs that underpins that so we get<br>this sort of notion of ordinariness but<br>we also get another dimension coming<br>through of people alone there's one<br>traveler and the theory there's one<br>traveler walking along the bank with his<br>laden horse this notion of loneliness<br>becomes quite a theme for hokusai in his<br>very last series again a picture of the<br>hinterlands but in this case not of fuji<br>sit in the mountains and this is an<br>image from a series of<br>of poetry called hyakunin isshu 100<br>people one one poem each this was a<br>volume above highly respected versus<br>very brief verses as you'll see in a<br>moment that were compiled by a member of<br>the imperial court six hundred years<br>earlier and they were in hockey sized<br>world that's what this this was the<br>reading that informed the cognitive<br>knowledge stock of the day and they were<br>great readers reading the poetry of the<br>classics being able to quote them being<br>able to cite them with ease was it was<br>considered one of the most essential<br>skills of any kind of social and<br>intellectual and of course and indeed if<br>one was wealthy enough to visit the<br>licensed brothel area which might cost<br>around in today's money around<br>twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars<br>for the evening and which would in fact<br>involve nothing more than in fact a meal<br>and drinks and and and musicians and<br>such song singing and and poetry<br>exchanges their ability to boot to know<br>the classical verses to be able to<br>exchange them to to be able to lead off<br>a half a line and for someone else to be<br>able to pick it up on the other side of<br>the of the room underpinned people's<br>ability to engage on a sophisticated and<br>and and cultivated level in this<br>instance he Illustrated every one of the<br>poems not with a picture of the person<br>who did it who wrote it not with the<br>picture of anyone it might have been<br>about but with a picture of our<br>landscape with people in it and the<br>landscape here is quite an interesting<br>one it's a mountain landscape in the<br>middle of winter and in Japan winter has<br>associated with loneliness with with<br>isolation obviously with cold the<br>the hunters and foresters gathered<br>around the fire depicted in something<br>that was very familiar to it all viewers<br>each one of them is holding a pose pose<br>was from the Kabuki theater it's called<br>a me a pose<br>kabuki plays take forever they can be<br>eight hours long and they can be nine<br>hours long the most famous one is 11<br>hours long and they're punctuated with<br>intervals and food and and and so on but<br>they're also punctuated with meta<br>moments of high drama and me a quite<br>typically occur when an actor stops at a<br>critical moment in their narrative and<br>Cesar's opposed and stands there frozen<br>and silent to emphasize the moment every<br>one of these actors our characters as in<br>such a pose what's interesting about<br>this picture is that beyond its<br>isolation beyond its winter theme this<br>is a picture about silence the hunters<br>and the the Foresters words are lost in<br>the latticework of smoke and flame and<br>snow the poem constructs what was known<br>as an hooter Makura<br>and a lose of poetic evocation of place<br>not a specific landmark again but of an<br>environment a setting if you like and it<br>mentions the mountains winter is linked<br>directly with loneliness and the<br>remainder of the poem increases most<br>when I think about how both have dried<br>up the grasses and people's visits talk<br>about that as it were a period in which<br>there is no richness and health a period<br>of great great sadness and that's here<br>code in this word Yukio which is the<br>word that probably is the most commonly<br>associated with this period look your<br>means floating<br>world and for the men and woman who<br>lived and at all what that signified was<br>our world in which you lived for the<br>moment it was a very hiddenness within a<br>narrow group of people are very<br>hiddenness d thoughts on which people<br>enjoyed food and drink theater music<br>verse and art like this but in buddhist<br>context eco means something quite<br>different this notion of ephemerality of<br>life this fleeting world of sorrow so as<br>we come to the last few minutes why is<br>all of this important to us today well I<br>think that the first reason is that<br>hockey sized voyage gives us quite<br>interesting insights and to what we very<br>broadly call in a creative practice and<br>creative dispositions or dispositions to<br>innovation in the first instance<br>these pictures were pictures of great<br>significance to their original public<br>they meant something to them it's not<br>that they helped them make sense of<br>their own world it helped them remember<br>the worlds of the past that helped them<br>remember the worlds that they had kind<br>of lost touch with in their urban center<br>and that notion that creativity is<br>underpinned by innovation that is of<br>value is the one that's most clearly<br>crystallized in a video that many of you<br>will have watched by Sir Ken Robinson I<br>think one of the very first kind-- talks<br>are TED talks<br>it's epitomized by Hokusai's polymath<br>curiosity is eccentricity his Restless<br>thirst to engage in new things all of<br>the time it<br>identifiable in this cognitive stock<br>around Fuji and classical literature and<br>the land and the particularly the<br>margins between land and sea which the<br>cognitive stock that gave a common<br>ground of understanding but which also<br>informed what Steve Jobs celebrates most<br>about creative practice the abilities to<br>take risks and make links connection<br>making there's an element of accident in<br>that but within that there is the notion<br>that Louie Pasteur voiced that in fact<br>if we have that rich cognitive stock to<br>build on chance favors the prepared mind<br>and finally there is a way of working<br>through from idea into practice that<br>requires some kind of procedural<br>methodology and the key here for Hokusai<br>and his world was this disposition to us<br>all be or play the second reason these<br>pictures matter is because they have a<br>real significance for the way we<br>understand learning today and alongside<br>learning teaching the first thing is<br>that I think within my lifetime the<br>world has experienced a significant<br>change in its worldview in in my<br>childhood<br>Keith Sinclair published one of the<br>first books that gave us a total view of<br>your abroad you of New Zealand history<br>it's called creatively a history of New<br>Zealand the very final sentence of that<br>book tells us if not verbatim in spirit<br>at least the thing that distinguishes<br>New Zealand culture from every other<br>place in the world is that we are as one<br>we are one culture and one social so<br>world that's being challenged by just<br>about every historian that's followed<br>them and what we now think about in<br>terms of education and learning and<br>particularly in my experience working in<br>museums and my attraction to museums is<br>because they provide first-hand<br>engagements with the artifacts of other<br>cultures from other times from all over<br>the world and I think that's a<br>significant change that changes young<br>people's view of the world as they're<br>developing now in ways that never<br>happened before it also helps us<br>understand how artists work and<br>understanding how artists work helps us<br>understand what they produce and finally<br>I mentioned at the beginning that the<br>significant change in art education in<br>this country in the last 30 years of<br>perhaps 35 is a shift or an expansion of<br>interest to include an embrace learning<br>about art learning about art and it's<br>world's art and its artists and art and<br>the people who enjoy it and the ability<br>to engage with that was what Richard<br>volha and the philosopher called<br>the practice of critical retrieval sadly<br>ritual volume never ever told us how to<br>do critical retrieval<br>however hockey so I think does in a very<br>real way and the third reason that this<br>is significant today there's that<br>between Christchurch between Fukushima<br>we are perhaps more acutely aware today<br>of the potentials for environmental<br>catastrophe either made by ourselves or<br>the ingot<br>emerging from the forces of nature than<br>we probably have ever been before I can<br>remember vividly when there was an<br>earthquake in Assisi reading about it in<br>the newspaper and watching an article<br>documentary about it three years four<br>years later now we see it happening and<br>I think that changes our whole world<br>view of the precarious hold we have on<br>the world we have the second thing is<br>that these works sustained really<br>significant sensibilities and values<br>across time and cultures and finally<br>they can teach us more about the world's<br>people live in more about the people in<br>those worlds than most other areas of<br>study and finally they teach us how art<br>provides a vehicle that can cross<br>borders taking understeering<br>understandings and engagements and<br>sensibilities between cultures and<br>peoples thank you<br>ten Dakota katoa my name is Tony<br>ballantine and I'm the<br>pro-vice-chancellor<br>humanities senators with great pleasure<br>there I'll deliver a vote of thanks to<br>Professor Bell he has delivered an<br>excellent lecture a set of reflections<br>that have woven together his deep<br>engagement with her art history his<br>particular interest in Japanese<br>aesthetic traditions his commitment to<br>art education and to education more<br>generally he has offered a rich set of<br>readings of this now iconic image stirs<br>repeatedly reworked here with an orange<br>and and of course he began by placing it<br>in the cultural landscape or Hokusai's<br>Japan and in that country's distinctive<br>visual culture there David introduced us<br>to the incredible range and depth of<br>Hawkeye's talents his deep commitment to<br>mastering a host of aesthetic traditions<br>his passion his restlessness and<br>playfulness that shaped against<br>convention and underpins his immense<br>creativity I think David has really<br>offered an incredibly evocative reading<br>of this image a kind of multiple<br>contextualization that aids those of us<br>unfamiliar with hawk acai or with the<br>visual arts or with Japanese culture to<br>make sense of the richness and<br>complexity of this image I also think<br>that Davis lecture has demonstrated many<br>of the qualities that make him such a<br>respected figure in both our art<br>communities and our educational<br>communities he is thoughtful imaginative<br>and incredibly engaging he has offered a<br>compelling set of reflections on the<br>interplay between the creative arts and<br>society between research and teaching<br>and between teaching and learning and of<br>course those are all concerns at the<br>heart of our mission here at the<br>University I also know from personal<br>experience that David is a tremendous<br>teacher I know that because he was my<br>fourth form<br>our teacher and I think it is true that<br>at some point in the career every<br>teacher comes up against a student who<br>cannot be helped I'm afraid that in<br>David's case I was that student but what<br>I can attest to is that David was<br>greatly respected by my peers<br>now respect is not something that comes<br>easy or naturally to 14 and 15 year old<br>boys but David was held in high esteem<br>because of his love for his subject and<br>because his love of teaching was so<br>evident in contagious and I think he has<br>conveyed that passion and enthusiasm<br>this evening and I know that those are<br>values that are very highly valued by<br>his students and his colleagues at the<br>college so professor Bell we have<br>greatly enjoyed your talk and we have<br>enjoyed coming together to join in this<br>celebration of your promotion so I<br>invite everyone to join me in thanking<br>David I do have a gift to present to him<br>and I would also invite you to join the<br>academic party for a reception and the<br>thank you all very much I'm going to<br>enjoy something cool and refreshing very<br>very soon so please do join us if you<br>can and thank you again all of you for<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
