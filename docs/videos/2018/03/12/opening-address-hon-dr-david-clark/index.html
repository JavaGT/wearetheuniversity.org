de<br>night arter Couture well it is a real<br>treat to be here not only because the<br>minister of health but also because it's<br>great to have such prestigious and<br>important events happening in the finest<br>electorate in the country since I've<br>welcomed also to those people who<br>journeyed South from Auckland and the<br>distinguished professors that have come<br>from abroad<br>professor reading and Wareham it is real<br>treat to have you here thank you I want<br>to acknowledge from the outset of the<br>work led by the Edgar diabetes and<br>obesity research centre and the<br>healthier lives national science<br>challenge and the leadership of City on<br>it and professor Jim men I'm very<br>pleased to be here to open this event<br>hosted by these two leading national<br>research organizations which are<br>collaborating to tackle a major health<br>issue for New Zealand we know that<br>diabetes represents a significant burden<br>in our communities with Maori Pacific<br>Indian Asian<br>and populations living in poverty<br>disproportionately impacted currently 7%<br>of New Zealand adults have type 2<br>diabetes in addition a quarter of our<br>adult population is estimated to have<br>pre-diabetes without preventative action<br>many of these people of course are<br>likely to go on to develop diabetes and<br>the prevalence of diabetes in New<br>Zealand has continued to rise over the<br>period 2010 to 2016 especially in these<br>inner cities although the rate of<br>increase has slowed in the last few<br>years everyone has a connection to<br>we tease my own mother actually worked<br>in diabetes prevention and care in South<br>Auckland during the latter part of her<br>medical career but my formative<br>engagement with diabetes came in<br>interactions with my grandmother when I<br>was a preschool child Grandma Lester was<br>born in 2010 and had diabetes type 1<br>from the age of 26 so in her case had<br>insulin not been discovered and<br>developed in 1921 she would have died I<br>would never have met her she followed<br>doctor's orders and survived to the age<br>of 70 although she was blind and of<br>course along the way he'd have toes<br>amputated with green gangrene my<br>earliest memories of my grandmother were<br>playing shops with those kind of<br>cardboard tea bag boxes and the old<br>yoghurt bottles the place that the round<br>plastic ones people can cast their minds<br>back yeah we played shops and and I can<br>also remember who preparing for her<br>injections it's one of my earliest<br>memories in my mother when I was talking<br>about this with fear reminded me of her<br>experience she remembers as a seven year<br>old using Eames tablets and test tubes<br>with urine to decide how many units of<br>insulin a grandmother who mother<br>required for the next injection it was<br>part of what the family were engaged in<br>during the war and the depression my<br>grandmother was given extra fat cream<br>because she couldn't have calories from<br>sugar and that even impacted on her<br>cardiovascular health and her postmortem<br>it was found that you know she had<br>clearly had many heart attacks well and<br>on that front thank goodness for modern<br>science in the continued innovation that<br>improves people's lives today although<br>health inequalities today do mean that<br>not everyone can access the kinds of<br>innovations available today and Mark was<br>using one that not everyone can access<br>currently it's Health Minister I am<br>someone who is interested in equity and<br>I'll be interested to hear more about<br>how the II do research I put in<br>the healthier live science challenge are<br>tackling the challenges presented by<br>gene environment and directions social<br>determinants of obesity strategies for<br>prevention and life course approaches<br>within their just communities the aging<br>population in people living longer with<br>diabetes contributes to the increased<br>prevalence of this condition<br>as we all know diabetes has a major<br>impact on the health system costing<br>around 11 percent of the health budget<br>annually and I note that think you see<br>on with my associate finance head on as<br>much as by health head on because<br>diabetes also contributes to our<br>nationwide loss of productivity higher<br>benefit payments in hardship for<br>individuals in their far no recent<br>mortality data shows that Maori and<br>Pacific peoples are five to seven times<br>more likely to die from diabetes related<br>cause than other population groups The<br>ministers the ministry's diabetes plan<br>living well with diabetes a plan for<br>people at high risk of living with<br>diabetes 2015 to 2020 provides a<br>medium-term plan to tackling diabetes<br>and ensures that all New Zealanders with<br>diabetes were at risk of developing type<br>2 diabetes are living well and have<br>access to high quality people seem to<br>health services obesity is a serious<br>issue that needs tackling a third of all<br>New Zealand children and two-thirds of<br>adults are overweight or obese with New<br>Zealand ranked third in the OECD for<br>obesity just behind the United States<br>and Mexico<br>we know that the high prevalence of<br>obesity is likely to increase the rate<br>of diabetes in the future in 2016 the<br>ministry published updated clinical<br>weight management guidelines for New<br>Zealand or all adults and I would like<br>to acknowledge professor man's role in<br>cheering the technical advisory group<br>that supported the update of these<br>guidelines thank you very much Tim one<br>of the key messages in those guidelines<br>is that people do not become obese<br>overnight we need to encourage and<br>support regular monitoring of weight and<br>primary care together with early<br>intervention and advice<br>someone is trending toward becoming<br>overweight or obese rather than waiting<br>until they are over they are obese to<br>intervene small changes earlier in life<br>may be all that's required in some cases<br>to prevent the future excess weight the<br>second key challenge in sorry the signal<br>each Ange in the guidelines is the<br>inclusion of sleep asleep is an area of<br>increasing research interest and I know<br>that o Tiger University has been<br>contributing to the growing evidence<br>base on sleep and its influence on our<br>eating behaviors and choices physical<br>activity levels and weight and I was<br>discussing earlier with Sioux City on<br>yet an earlier event today the insight<br>that we're in a foot but for a week has<br>given me into sleep pins I thought I was<br>doing a lot better than I am<br>but you know that monitoring and that<br>focus on improving our own lives and<br>having better information is something I<br>think we're going to see a lot more of<br>and it's incredibly valuable and I have<br>to also took my hit to see a city on who<br>cleaned me up and the in their in the<br>charts of how many steps we'd taken<br>during the week he is truly leading the<br>cause from the front<br>last year the ministry also published<br>new guidelines for physical activity in<br>children and young people and for under<br>fives it's at least smoove more sleep<br>well we were the first country in the<br>world to introduce sleep into our<br>physical activity guidelines for under<br>fives here we were acknowledged the<br>support that we received from a<br>partnership that we have developed with<br>Canada and Australian researchers who<br>were also working on new integrated<br>guidelines for the early years and via<br>countries both of the guidelines were<br>released at the end of last year in the<br>Canadians also granted us permission to<br>adopt via guidelines for children and<br>young people aged 5 to 18 years our<br>collaboration has meant that all three<br>countries have consistent messages and I<br>understand further that the UK will also<br>be considering the inclusion of sleep<br>and via next children's guidelines this<br>is a great example of international<br>collaboration between researchers in<br>policy makers<br>the ministry is in the process of<br>developing a roadmap for the next five<br>years to reduce childhood obesity<br>diabetes and other long-term conditions<br>it will have an increased focus on<br>achieving equity in access and outcomes<br>I believe we must move to taking a<br>stronger primary prevention approach to<br>reduce the incidence of diabetes in<br>other non communicable diseases<br>establishing regular healthy eating and<br>physical activity patterns are key to<br>reducing obesity preventing diabetes<br>improve Oh improving our overall health<br>of children and adults over the life<br>course this cannot be achieved by more<br>information alone a comprehensive suite<br>of approaches is required we all know<br>there's too much sugar in our diets and<br>we need to change that reducing mean and<br>takes of sugar salt and saturated fat as<br>part of the wh O's non-communicable<br>diseases plan i've arranged to meet with<br>leading food industry companies and have<br>asked them to outline their plans to<br>reduce sugar levels in our processed<br>food and drink i want the industry to<br>step up but i'll also be clear with them<br>when i do sit down with them very soon<br>that I am prepared to regulate if they<br>do not step up then we will take action<br>reviewing policies for children's food<br>environments is also in the pipeline<br>however if there is not sufficient<br>progress we would need to look at other<br>options I also believe that we need<br>better more meaningful targets for<br>addressing over weight and obesity the<br>ministry already funds primary<br>prevention services healthy families New<br>Zealand is a large scale initiative that<br>brings community leadership together to<br>improve people's health where they live<br>learn work and play by taking a dynamic<br>systems approach to preventing chronic<br>disease healthy families New Zealand<br>supports communities that think<br>differently about the underlying causes<br>of poor health and to make changes in<br>our early childhood education settings<br>schools workplaces food outlets sports<br>clubs marae businesses<br>places of worship local governments and<br>more to create healthier environments<br>for all at the recent II we cheers forum<br>at Waitangi the healthy families New<br>Zealand approach was endorsed<br>unanimously by the e we cheers as an<br>approach that is improving Maori health<br>and reducing inequalities for groups at<br>increased risk of chronic diseases in<br>addition the ministry of health funds a<br>range of primary prevention services<br>prioritizing populations with high<br>levels of lifestyle diseases these<br>services are delivered by national<br>regional and local providers using<br>population approaches that support<br>communities to make healthy lifestyle<br>changes services take a range of actions<br>including advocating for environmental<br>change so the healthy choice is an easy<br>choice providing workforce development<br>programs for staff promoting in<br>supporting individual behavior changes<br>and working with the food industry and<br>catering company companies to improve<br>the nutrient profile of foods the<br>ministry is considering a range of cross<br>government options for addressing<br>declining physical activity levels in<br>New Zealand these include proposals<br>intended to give effect to the World<br>Health Organization's global action plan<br>on physical activity which recognizes<br>that a Jeanette Jane is needed to<br>include health outcomes through physical<br>activity in countries in organisations<br>priorities and investments to conclude<br>we must work together with our<br>international colleagues to collectively<br>find treatments and Prevention's that<br>work for all members of our society we<br>are part of a global community<br>and while we strive for local solutions<br>to these issues in New Zealand we can<br>learn much from those in other countries<br>facing similar challenges I thank you<br>for the opportunity to address you here<br>today and for the good work you have<br>already done that is well documented as<br>well as the good work that as Minister<br>of Health I'm looking forward to you<br>doing that I expect will also be well<br>documented no raela tena koutou tena koe<br>TNA Tata Tata</p></main><footer
