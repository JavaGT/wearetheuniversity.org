Paul's Hospital in the<br>cardiology department connected to these<br>other organizations that hospital was<br>built in the 1930s and if there's a<br>large earthquake in Vancouver apparently<br>only ten percent of that building will<br>be standing so consequently the asset of<br>a hospital and everything it contains<br>will turn into a liability so obviously<br>we need to build a new hospital and<br>that's the plan for the new construction<br>the reason I put it up there is because<br>there's opportunities to engage<br>indigenous peoples health and well-being<br>in the health care institution that's<br>being built and will probably be<br>standing for the next hundred years so<br>that's a big part of my interest is<br>looking at the intersection of health<br>services at a hospital st. Paul's that's<br>kind of a faith based Hospital as you<br>can imagine First Nations Health<br>Authority which delivers services<br>increased policies and then the<br>University where advanced knowledge is<br>created and so it's about thinking about<br>these terms the its treatment discovery<br>and advocacy advocacy but it's in those<br>spaces between those things and the<br>intersection of those areas where<br>exciting things can happen you can<br>create new research knowledge you can<br>advocate for different kinds of programs<br>and services and then you can lead to<br>treatments so it all the intersection<br>it's about having the people who produce<br>knowledge connected to the people who<br>consume that knowledge to improve the<br>health of people that's a different way<br>of organizing health research and put in<br>policy this is the Canadian Institutes<br>for health research which used to be the<br>Medical Research Council of Canada I'm<br>taking you back to 2000 when it was<br>first created there are 13 scientific<br>directors there Allen Bernstein is<br>seated in the bottom and this<br>organization has annual funding of about<br>a billion dollars which pales in<br>comparison to the NIH but is pretty<br>significant in Canadian terms so of<br>these 13 institutes there's a woman<br>there Diane fine good<br>any of you may know sitting next to Alan<br>with the mustache she was the Institute<br>Director for nutrition metabolism and<br>diabetes and as you can imagine we had a<br>lot of interest I'm in the back row<br>standing up we did a lot of<br>collaborating and among these Institute<br>directors we collaborated on all kinds<br>of projects around cancer heart disease<br>public health health services research<br>and those collaborations were a<br>game-changer it was an opportunity to<br>sit at the table where priorities for<br>advance knowledge creation could be<br>determined and funded and we actually<br>created capacity in these areas across<br>it was a very very exciting time to be<br>involved with that so one of the things<br>I wanted to talk to my colleagues who<br>were in biomedical clinical research was<br>this notion that diseases have two<br>causes and it's been known for a long<br>time more than a hundred years the first<br>of course is pathophysiological and the<br>second is political and so I want to<br>talk to a little bit about that in the<br>context of Canada and this is just one<br>case study of many it has to start off<br>with a conversation around colonization<br>and the expansion of European power and<br>I think all of us understand this and<br>you can see that this is from the 1700s<br>and there had been some migration<br>towards the Americas primary for the<br>purposes of trade again you can see<br>coming up a couple of hundred years into<br>the 19th century you can see that the<br>colonial expansion from Europe had<br>extended all pretty much across the<br>world and included the Commonwealth<br>which included Canada Australia and of<br>course New Zealand and that had<br>significant impacts you can't really<br>talk about colonization and Aboriginal<br>health or you must talk about the<br>connection between the two because they<br>inform one another consequently in<br>Canada there were a number of treaties<br>that were determined and they're like<br>contracts that were developed between<br>the crown in England and or modern<br>treaties in Canada and the various<br>groups as the migration moved across the<br>country and it's important to recognize<br>that treaties are agreements and<br>contracts<br>between two parties so it's not like<br>indigenous people are party to the<br>treaty so it has only to do with them<br>the mainstream population of these<br>nation states Canada Australia and New<br>Zealand are parties to the treaty so<br>we're all part of the treaty where it's<br>all part of a contract we all have a<br>role to play in the expression and<br>implementation of contracts in my home<br>community as I mentioned the alliance<br>with the British meant that we signed a<br>contract a treaty back in the 1700s<br>about a hundred and ten years before<br>Canada became a nation-state<br>so what success this is I wasn't up to<br>what angee because I'd always wanted to<br>go there and I was very interested and I<br>missed the treaty day by a couple of<br>days but I thought this was an<br>interesting picture here is that the<br>it's a matter of perspective about how<br>to celebrate treaties and I think there<br>are different perspectives depending on<br>where you lit live and where you what<br>your history has been and so I wanted to<br>talk to you a little bit about the<br>health history of indigenous people in<br>Canada I couldn't really talk about your<br>health history because I haven't lived<br>here and I'm not Maori so this is a case<br>where was reported by a couple of<br>colleagues of mine one is the former<br>grand chief of the Assembly of First<br>Nations Phil Fontaine and other<br>colleagues that I worked with and it's<br>about a Canadian genocide which was came<br>about as a result of this national<br>inquiry the Truth and Reconciliation<br>Commission report and what it involved<br>was they looked at Aboriginal children<br>who were basically in these church<br>funded residential schools the federal<br>government provided funding for training<br>at these residential schools and<br>consequently that the children there<br>weren't getting enough food to eat as<br>well documented and it this is in the<br>1940s and it basically turned out that<br>that it turned out to be a very good<br>experimental model to look at the<br>efficacy or at least try to look at the<br>efficacy of vitamins and minerals that<br>are being developed at the time so they<br>basically conducted nutritional<br>experiments on children who were taken<br>away from their family<br>and forced into these residential<br>schools now Canada conducted the series<br>of nutrition experiments on First<br>Nations children in the residential<br>schools and this was disclosed recently<br>by a geographer at the University of<br>Guelph in Ontario's name's Ian Mosby<br>who's not an Aboriginal person the<br>experiments were supervised by dr.<br>Tisdale who was one of the co-inventors<br>of pablum which is a formula for infants<br>that was quite groundbreaking and useful<br>at the time providing nutrient<br>micronutrients and vitamins for children<br>children are placed on special diets and<br>denied basic dental care to see if their<br>if their gums would bleed the idea there<br>was if these consequences side effects<br>of these vitamins and nutrients there<br>they were denied services so it's a lot<br>like some other trials where they knew<br>that there were treatments available but<br>the treatments were not made available<br>because it was part of a research study<br>something like the tuskegee trial that<br>many of you are familiar with the<br>syphilis cohort that was denied<br>treatment even though the treatments<br>were available none of this was done<br>with their knowledge or their parents<br>knowledge or consent<br>super survivors of these experiments<br>were recalled being hungry all the time<br>and then today diabetes and obesity are<br>intergenerational eating disorders among<br>these residential school survivors so<br>the developmental origins of health and<br>disease and then biomedical and clinical<br>research that we now are engaging in and<br>we're actually starting to do some of<br>that work is starting to prove that you<br>know having calorie limitations during<br>developmental stages actually<br>predisposes you to diabetes and other<br>chronic conditions later in life I'm not<br>really trying to you know badmouth<br>Canada outside its borders I'm just<br>trying to say that when indigenous<br>people look at health and research in<br>general and healthcare institutions<br>there's a history there there's a reason<br>why people were not served by these<br>institutions and those memories of those<br>histories are still alive so that's<br>another thing that wouldn't occur to you<br>unless you had a knowledge of it I wrote<br>a paper about this with<br>a couple of colleagues of one of them is<br>my wife Charlotte there and it was<br>looking at a real Commission report that<br>happened in the 1997 and then comparing<br>it to this other report which was the<br>Truth and Reconciliation report in 2017<br>a 20-year period and basically came to<br>the same conclusions now of course some<br>things had happened in those 20 years<br>but it wasn't the changes that we had<br>hoped for so I wanted to go into a<br>little bit of the Canadian history just<br>to explain a little bit about why it was<br>that and maybe we can draw some<br>parallels to the circumstances here<br>because the context again is so<br>important so this is a picture of our<br>first Prime Minister and one of the one<br>of the board members who are sitting on<br>the board for the Truth and<br>Reconciliation Commission asked the<br>question what is it about the ways that<br>we have organized our lives like in<br>Canada and our communities and our<br>resources in this country that has made<br>one group so disproportionately unwell<br>and it's a question I think all<br>Commonwealth countries could ask of<br>their indigenous populations so of<br>course any good diagnosis begins with a<br>family history so let's look back at<br>Canada's family history let's look back<br>to the first head of our household so<br>Sir John a McDonald made this statement<br>in cabinet and in the on the floor of<br>the House of Commons no Indian should be<br>withdrawn or Indian children should be<br>withdrawn as much as possible from<br>parental influence and the only way to<br>do that would to be put that would be to<br>put them in a central training in<br>residential schools where they will<br>acquire the habits and modes and<br>thoughts of white men so it was<br>definitely a forced assimilation agenda<br>these children were taken from their<br>parents and brought into these<br>government-funded religious residential<br>schools and there's an example of when<br>they're there learning the alphabet I<br>guess but it's obviously transmitting a<br>lot more than the alphabet there with<br>the banner looking onto Jesus now this<br>individual here is our prime minister<br>probably prior to our current prime<br>minister<br>Stephen Harper and he actually did make<br>a very emotional apology to the<br>survivors of residential schools in the<br>House of Commons back in 2008 but I've<br>my take on that was I think he he said<br>okay we're sorry end of story<br>let's just move on forget about it well<br>it's not that easy it turns out so we<br>now we have a new prime minister who's<br>actually campaigned and talked about the<br>narrowing the gap and issues around<br>health determinants and other factors<br>related to Aboriginal peoples he said no<br>relationship is more important to me in<br>to Canada than the one with indigenous<br>peoples it's time for a renewed<br>nation-to-nation relationship with<br>indigenous peoples based on the<br>recognition of Rights respect<br>cooperation and partnership and that<br>those those words were pulled from<br>letters that were in the extracted from<br>ministerial mandate letters to 30<br>cabinet ministers who were running each<br>of the department's so the question is<br>we have 150 year birthday last year in<br>Canada since Confederation in 1967 we<br>have Sir John McDonald Stephen Harper<br>and Justin Trudeau of course his father<br>was also Prime Minister and we're<br>calling reconciliation the unfinished<br>business of Confederation recently<br>Justin Trudeau made some very<br>provocative statements in the House of<br>Commons with his justice minister who's<br>a First Nations woman from BC and they<br>are going to look at redefining the<br>relationship between indigenous people<br>in Canada as a nation-state so stay<br>tuned<br>this is like yeah there's going to be<br>some things happening especially as we<br>move forward toward another federal<br>election I did actually pull something I<br>love the internet you can get all kinds<br>of great pictures from there I got this<br>out this morning and it's from your new<br>New Zealand prime minister who is<br>standing alongside her husband they're<br>up at the Waitangi grounds<br>and at the bottom of that she says<br>there's much to do<br>in the past few days she's spoken with<br>ewwy about health education housing<br>roads employment and now makes the<br>statement that we must turn talk into<br>action great that sounds very<br>interesting so we've got these two Prime<br>Minister's or to post Commonwealth<br>countries who are sort of on the same<br>page it might be a good opportunity to<br>start some bilateral discussions around<br>how Canada and New Zealand could<br>actually function together so I<br>apologize if this wasn't what you<br>expected it has a more of a political<br>plan but you don't get to speak to a<br>minister of health every day here we<br>have a leader in Canada he's an<br>indigenous physician and president of<br>the indigenous physicians Association in<br>Canada they met in Vancouver at their<br>annual General Assembly and he's talking<br>about reconciliation and health I think<br>his words are very well thought out<br>when reconciliation is talked about we<br>often talk about sharing history we talk<br>about sharing recommendations and<br>stories from the Commission and those<br>are all very powerful things but when<br>you look at what reconciliation is it's<br>the changing of two groups two different<br>groups often on opposite sides becoming<br>something better both becoming something<br>better it's not just about empowerment<br>of First Nations or First Nations<br>patients it's about empowering you or us<br>it to be allies and to find our place in<br>the Canadian fabric that doesn't exclude<br>indigenous peoples so it's about an<br>inclusive partnership it's a boat going<br>down the river together not interfering<br>with each other but helping each other<br>and being friends decolonization is<br>about the undoing of colonialism we're a<br>nation established and maintains its<br>domination over dependent territories it<br>requires both systemic and individual<br>efforts so there is some helpful<br>documents in in the global press in the<br>global policy domain talking about the<br>rights to self-determine<br>determination the right to actively be<br>involved in health and developing and<br>determining health housing and other<br>economic and social programs traditional<br>medicines<br>accessing healthcare practices and<br>programs without discrimination to all<br>social and health services and the<br>highest achieving the highest attainable<br>standards of health and well-being<br>including mental health so this is our<br>Minister of Indian Affairs or it's<br>called Indigenous Affairs now dr.<br>carolyn bennett is a physician who<br>started the public health agency in a<br>previous government she is a very strong<br>advocate for indigenous health and<br>women's health and of course carolyn is<br>now moving forward to redefine the<br>relationship in partnership with<br>indigenous peoples around this sort of<br>treaty based nation-state like similar<br>to the kinds of model that is in New<br>Zealand I think I'm here to announce on<br>behalf of Canada that we are now a full<br>supporter of the declaration that's the<br>International Declaration on indigenous<br>health people's without qualification we<br>intend nothing less than to adopt and<br>implement the declaration in accordance<br>with the Canadian Constitution so she's<br>saying there's going to change the<br>constitution<br>I think the Truth and Reconciliation<br>Commission specific health care<br>recommendations have to do with Canada's<br>role acknowledging the poor health of<br>indigenous peoples recognizing<br>jurisdictional challenges training more<br>health professionals increasing the<br>cultural safety of health services<br>creating mandatory skills based training<br>for intercultural competency these among<br>non-indigenous medical practitioners<br>conflict resolution human rights and<br>anti racism for physicians and nurses I<br>mean these are explicit things that came<br>out of about three years of consultation<br>with communities providing resources for<br>healing centers and recognizing<br>indigenous healing practices and<br>reporting on progress report cars with<br>specific health indicators another<br>minister who is also a physician who<br>works in global health and primary<br>healthcare and who's also has an<br>appointment at the dalla Lana School of<br>Public Health at the University of<br>Toronto was mr. Jane Philpott and she<br>was the Federal Minister of Health and<br>she's moved into<br>indigenous health services part of the<br>indigenous program working alongside<br>Carolyn Bennett but at that time she<br>said we're committed to redoing our<br>nation to nation relationship with<br>indigenous peoples and my department's<br>ongoing work to improve health services<br>for persons is fundamental to achieving<br>that goal so you get the idea here we<br>actually at the federal level with<br>cabinet there's a lot of movement<br>towards creating a policy and a funding<br>environment to fundamentally redesign<br>the relationship so in the place that<br>partially funds my research chair in<br>heart health and well-being this is the<br>phrase that kind of stands out nothing<br>about us without us and it involves a<br>level of reciprocal accountability<br>between various parts of the government<br>when it with respect to indigenous<br>health issues I won't be going through<br>all this slide just to show you that it<br>wasn't that easy to move this whole<br>agenda forward to take over the<br>healthcare services of an entire<br>province it involved trilateral<br>arrangements with the federal government<br>which is responsible for indigenous<br>affairs and the provincial government<br>which was responsible for healthcare<br>affairs but it was done and it is<br>operating and spends about 700 million<br>dollars a year on the provision of<br>services in the province and additional<br>300 million comes from the province for<br>tertiary care services so it is about<br>reciprocal county accountability and if<br>you haven't heard that it's about<br>working together at all levels in a<br>collaborative manner to achieve shared<br>goals I will be providing these slides<br>if any graduate students or anyone else<br>is interested they can also look at them<br>later but there are some common ideas<br>foundational ideas here about turning<br>the health care system into a wellness<br>care system is sort of the short brief<br>on that and that's the idea is try to<br>hear the voices of communities around<br>the priorities and what to do and get<br>some respect back to into the health<br>care system for patients rights not that<br>it's not there but sometimes it's<br>missing in indigenous populations so it<br>is a tripartite arrangement between<br>ministry<br>health of health canada the provincial<br>health services authority and other<br>regional health authorities which also<br>participates so there's a lot of<br>interaction going on and i thought it<br>was an important model to at least be<br>aware of again a cultural safety and<br>humility is an important aspect of all<br>this it talks about cultural competency<br>something we strive for cultural<br>humility is the only way we can get<br>there with an open heart and open mind<br>we can increase the space for cultural<br>safety by the way this all came from New<br>Zealand we stole this from New Zealand a<br>couple of nurses came up with this<br>notion here in New Zealand and wrote<br>about it and it's just taken off in<br>Canada this is I thought I'd better put<br>in a slide about good healthy eating I<br>barbecued all this stuff on the top<br>right hand corner that's not a<br>indigenous chicken that's a regular<br>chicken you buy at a store so there is a<br>lot of ideas that float around around<br>Aboriginal people about being risky and<br>vulnerable and marginalized and there's<br>a lot of inequality what I'm saying here<br>is that words matter and they're not<br>like substitutes you have to use the<br>right words so it starts off with social<br>exclusion which I tried to show a little<br>bit which leads to marginalization a<br>marginalization can lead to inequality<br>equality leads to risk risk leads to<br>vulnerability and the cycle can get<br>worse as you go through it<br>it can also be turn the other direction<br>if you actually intervene and break that<br>cycle to try to improve and lift up<br>communities that are you know need<br>equity and they're marginals so what we<br>have here is something that we all know<br>about which is this life course<br>perspective and this is a utopian<br>picture of how when goes through that<br>journey of life along this path at<br>various life stages things happen and<br>and we kind of lived life and it's a<br>wonderful opportunity to enjoy sadly<br>it's not always the case in Aboriginal<br>peoples this is a paper we got published<br>in the Canadian Medical Association<br>Journal back in their 90s and it<br>basically is showing a six-fold higher<br>rate for diabetes for<br>indigenous men and women compared to<br>mainstream Canadians and nothing much<br>has changed over the 20 years because we<br>haven't addressed this of the underlying<br>social conditions and the different<br>opportunities within the life course so<br>I'm going to go quickly through this<br>because I expect many of you understand<br>this but there's this idea to optimize a<br>developmental trajectory through the<br>life course<br>so each stage there's stages that you<br>can address and then there's things they<br>become cumulative as you go through the<br>course of life depending on what you do<br>in each stage of course and so what<br>really matters is this complex<br>interaction of health determinants in<br>particular Aboriginal indigenous context<br>over the entire life course it becomes<br>accumulative not to say that there's<br>always room for improvement there's<br>always room for getting better no matter<br>how ill you are you can always intervene<br>so there are a bunch of factors that<br>look at you know these social determines<br>which we all know about genetic<br>endowment and biology is emerging as a<br>very strong area of research interest<br>and we actually just got a very large<br>grant to look at what we're calling<br>silent genomes undiagnosed treatable<br>illnesses among Aboriginal kid kids in<br>Canada so there is a paper written by<br>John Frank who's in Great Britain but<br>this is in case you're interested it<br>gives a better explanation of this sort<br>of framework for balancing social<br>determinants with life course and<br>looking at health services where we<br>spend billions and billions of dollars<br>and the other factors that affect health<br>we don't spend nearly as much money so<br>the idea is let's reinvest into some of<br>the things that determine health at<br>critical stages of the life course to<br>avoid some of the consequences of health<br>services down the stream again if you're<br>going to do that you want to focus where<br>the bang for your buck is going to be<br>best my personal interest is getting in<br>and looking at maternal child health<br>which is really the health of women and<br>looking at women's health has they<br>especially women of maternal age and<br>then looking at the end<br>to uterine environment and in tracking<br>especially through the early stages of<br>life to make sure that everything that<br>can be done is being done to optimize<br>the developmental opportunities for kids<br>so this is the last slide I wanted to<br>just wrap up this person Novell Morris<br>and he's passed away he was given a<br>bucket of paints different colors in<br>prison when he was in his 40s and he<br>invented something called the woodland<br>school of art and he's extremely well<br>recognized this figure on the bottom<br>that's actually an adult person with a<br>head and shoulders so that gives you the<br>size of the scale of this piece that he<br>actually drew are painted and he called<br>it and raja'na ilayk it because it<br>represents the Ojibwe shamans view of<br>the world it shows a thriving and<br>bountiful world in which all the diverse<br>elements are in perfect balance and I<br>think to me it really it really<br>exemplifies the fact that there's much<br>to be learned and gained from engaging<br>with indigenous community centers at<br>some point we're going to get to a point<br>where we can actually have this<br>reciprocal relationship and you know<br>improve well-being together thank you<br>very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
