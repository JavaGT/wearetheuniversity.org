kind<br>introduction Jim first and foremost<br>thank you Mark for your introduction and<br>it's a pleasure and a privilege to be<br>here thank you sir Ian for your<br>introduction and also Minister for your<br>speech I know you may have to leave<br>midway through what I'm going to say so<br>I'm going to say the message now in case<br>you leave before yeah because part of<br>its for you which is I'll give you the<br>summary of the talk and everyone else<br>can put your fingers in your ear but the<br>summary is that individualized<br>approaches to dealing with the diabetes<br>epidemic might widen inequalities if<br>they're not done right and they will<br>have a place but they are not the<br>solution and if we're to take the point<br>that Jeff made seriously which is that<br>that diabetes is a medical manifestation<br>of a pathophysiological problem it's<br>also a public health manifestation of a<br>societal problem and we cannot rely on<br>the same evidence train to get to that<br>point of what works so if you ask people<br>what works what's going to do it they'll<br>say we don't know and that's because we<br>need a different evidential process and<br>what it requires is bold action and then<br>evaluation so it's very gratifying in<br>your introduction to hear you say the<br>things you said about some of the bold<br>actions that you're willing to take and<br>if I don't get to the bit of the talk<br>about the food industry before you leave<br>I think whilst going along with trying<br>to get voluntary reformulation if you<br>don't hold that potential stick of<br>regulation I would say nothing's going<br>to happen so very much support where you<br>sorry you can yeah please stay what I<br>also wanted to say we've Jeff and I and<br>others and shrieky who's chaired the<br>group who've been doing the review it is<br>always a privilege to come to another<br>country and see the research that's<br>being undertaken and we have learnt a<br>lot by being here we have only I think<br>reflected back to you some thoughts of<br>ours that I don't know if they're wise<br>or not but it's very on earth of being<br>part of the evaluation of the healthier<br>lives program which i think is of<br>fundamental importance to new zealand<br>science so I as as well said I'm a<br>clinician who works in the Institute of<br>metabolic sciences so I care for people<br>with diabetes I also have a big program<br>and a big unit trying to understand why<br>some people get diabetes and some don't<br>but I also think that I would be<br>negligent in my career if I didn't take<br>a step back and say well what are we<br>going to do about it so I have a very<br>big program of research saying what are<br>the likely solutions to this problem and<br>what the essence of what I want to talk<br>about to you today is where should we be<br>intervening and these are not<br>alternatives this is a question of<br>balance so we could intervene at the<br>population trying to stop people<br>progressing from normality through<br>pre-diabetes to undiagnosed diabetes to<br>diagnose diabetes we could take a<br>screening approach and try and find type<br>2 diabetes early and treated early<br>we could take a high-risk approach and<br>try and find people at high risk and<br>intervene and stop them progressing from<br>pre-diabetes to undiagnosed diabetes the<br>question is which now you'll go to some<br>talks in the world and some people will<br>say I have the answer it should be this<br>or that they're all wrong right it's a<br>question of balance so and I want to<br>stress to you today that we haven't<br>quite got the balance right<br>so in terms of screening that first bit<br>should we be finding people who have<br>diabetes today but don't know about it<br>and it seems self-evident that we should<br>because of you this is a paper I wrote<br>many years ago about should we screen<br>for diabetes evaluate it against certain<br>criteria and diabetes fulfills all of<br>those criteria except one which is do we<br>have definitive evidence that by finding<br>the disease early in a preclinical phase<br>before diagnosis that people benefit in<br>the long term<br>now it's self-evident to everybody that<br>that's the case but there has never been<br>a randomized controlled trial that's<br>tested that and there will never be<br>because it would be unethical to find<br>people who've got prevalent undiagnosed<br>diabetes and not tell half and tell the<br>other half that would be a difficult<br>trial to get through so we have to rely<br>on different forms of evidence so we<br>have done a randomized control trial of<br>different intensities of therapy from<br>the point of diagnosis and that's the<br>two lines you can see at the bottom and<br>this this y axis here is the cumulative<br>incidence of cardiovascular events what<br>that means is how many people went on to<br>have a heart attack or a stroke over<br>time and this is tying going this way<br>and the the the red line is is routine<br>care and the blue line is intensive<br>treatment and you can see that finding<br>people with prevalent but undiagnosed<br>diabetes and throwing the book at them<br>makes a small bit of difference but not<br>much now what we'd like to say what's<br>the effect in their screening what's the<br>effectiveness of bringing forward that<br>point of diagnosis and you can't<br>directly observe that but you can model<br>it and that's what we did here and this<br>is what a three-year delay in<br>instituting routine care would give you<br>much higher risk or a five year or a six<br>year risk in in purple what this<br>suggests is there definitely are<br>benefits of screening but they're<br>probably relatively small and certainly<br>in our country they are greater than the<br>benefits of trying to intensify<br>treatment at the point of diagnosis<br>that's probably because care for most<br>people in England this is a try<br>in England the Netherlands and in<br>Denmark where Carys on the whole pretty<br>good it may be different in other places<br>so what about the closest you can do to<br>a randomized controlled trial of<br>screening so we did a trial where we<br>went to practices use the risk score to<br>predict who had diabetes and then in a<br>randomised controlled trial some of them<br>we actually went on to find who had<br>diabetes and some of them we left alone<br>so this is a randomized control trial of<br>screening at the population level and<br>you can see the the red is the control<br>the blue is the screening this is the<br>cumulative probability of death there is<br>no difference now that doesn't mean that<br>the people who've been screened and<br>found to have diabetes have benefited<br>what it means is they're only a small<br>proportion of that total population so<br>that effect is small so what my<br>conclusion is that screening probably is<br>beneficial but don't expect it to have a<br>major major public health effect because<br>you can't really see it in this trial<br>now research only gets you so far and<br>then you need politics and then you need<br>political decisive action and some<br>people argued about this but our then<br>Prime Minister Gordon Brown actually<br>just announced one day they were going<br>to have a free NHS check which I don't<br>think it's too different to what you<br>have here in terms of a cardiovascular<br>screening and we have actually just<br>published today of all days this paper<br>in PLoS Medicine about an evaluation of<br>that and because it this hasn't been<br>subjected to a trial either you just<br>evaluate it but it looks like it's<br>improving creasing quality adjusted life<br>years by 3.8 days per head of population<br>and increasing survival by 3.3 days now<br>whether you think that's big or small is<br>a matter of judgment it's not very big<br>but it's not so different to other<br>screening programs actually so screening<br>is important but it may not be the<br>answer a really important thing here is<br>that the way this is being delivered in<br>in England means that<br>local areas have the potential to target<br>particular subgroups and they are<br>intrinsically targeting people from<br>lower socioeconomic groups such that the<br>current program actually has a greater<br>absolute impact on health on those<br>living in the most deprived areas and<br>that's quite unusual so this is actually<br>reducing equities but the size of the<br>effect is quite smaller now it's this is<br>an important consideration because when<br>we did this study in Ely which is just<br>north of Cambridge four and a half<br>percent of the population had prevalent<br>but undiagnosed diabetes but actually<br>nearly 17 percent of them had a form of<br>pre-diabetes so the question is what do<br>we do for those people now they're<br>obviously detectable but is it worth<br>detecting so we know in from major and<br>really excellent trials in the United<br>States that if you randomized people<br>with that pre-diabetes to placebo in<br>read and/or lifestyle in blue and then<br>look at the cumulative probability of<br>going on to get diabetes it's hard so it<br>under ideal circumstances lifestyle<br>interventions diet and physical activity<br>half the risk of progression to diabetes<br>excellent news so in terms of taking<br>that evidence our head of our NHS Simon<br>Stevens said right let's institute this<br>here in England now that's important<br>because he's also on record as saying<br>which is true that 10% of our budget is<br>spent on diabetes care now what I want<br>to counsel against is expectation<br>because he said and by doing prevention<br>doing nothing as an option preventing<br>type 2 diabetes very important and it'll<br>help reduce costs and whilst that might<br>be true in the long term it is<br>categorically not true in the short term<br>and I'll show you why so we each year we<br>look at three million people were<br>eligible about half of them turn up for<br>a check the number who are deemed to be<br>a sufficient risk to have a test of<br>diabetes is a six<br>mm and of those about 129,000 would be<br>at a level of prediabetes to warrant<br>having an intervention that's a lot of<br>people but by doing that you also find<br>29,000 people who had diabetes but<br>didn't know about it now they are new<br>patients going into primary care which<br>is already struggling so then that's not<br>going to be a reduction in cost it might<br>be good for health in the long term as I<br>said but short term there's going to be<br>increased costs now what about these<br>people 129,000 well we were estimating<br>about a 40 percent uptake into this<br>intervention and that it would reduce<br>risk by about 26% now that means that<br>they're eighty-one thousand people<br>who've got this pre-diabetes don't want<br>to come to this intervention and they're<br>going to their GPS on top of the<br>30-something thousand you've got<br>diabetes so that's a lot of people<br>swamping the system the other challenge<br>is to do is a technical thing about risk<br>because if the risk you actually<br>introduce people in is is high then you<br>might reduce with this intervention a<br>lifestyle intervention about 4,000 cases<br>but it might be as low as two and a half<br>thousand if they were at lower risk now<br>over a 10-year period but you've got a<br>short-term increase in all those<br>patients coming into the system so it's<br>a very long-term strategy I think it<br>will work but it's not the answer one of<br>the problems is that what happens when<br>you Institute a big program is that you<br>go from what is known in trials and you<br>roll it out into the real world and<br>everybody says but we've got a lot of<br>people who need this so let's enroll<br>everyone we can and that means you it<br>gets too big and you enroll people who<br>are low risk and if you do that it's a<br>technical thing these are different<br>levels of risk and this is the cost of<br>the likelihood of something being cost<br>effective and essentially the more<br>low-risk people you<br>introducing to this type of program the<br>much less likely it is to be cost<br>effective the other tendency is to is to<br>try and dilute the the intensity the<br>intervention which reduces its effect so<br>there's a big issue about rollout of<br>these types of interventions when you<br>come to the real world so we need to<br>make a distinction a randomized control<br>trial like the one I showed you tells<br>you about effort for efficacy which is<br>you know does this work under ideal<br>circumstances but what we want to know<br>living in the real world is<br>effectiveness what does it work on<br>average in the real world and the gap<br>between those two things which I really<br>like this term is achievable benefit not<br>achieved you could achieve it but it is<br>not being achieved and this is the gap<br>okay Danny is very large so here's I got<br>to show you some data from the United<br>States a trial called the VA move which<br>compared the risk of going on to get<br>diabetes of people who participated in<br>an intervention compared to didn't and<br>they had a 20% reduction in risk of<br>going on to get diabetes it sounds good<br>if those people engaged in this program<br>in an intense and sustained way it was a<br>33% reduction in risk sounds excellent<br>the authors of this paper concluded it's<br>obviously effective okay it's effective<br>for these people who did this but what<br>about the population well they looked at<br>1.8 million people only 13% of them did<br>it at all and only 1% of the people did<br>it in an intense a sustained way so when<br>you say is it effective its effective<br>for those 1% a bit but what about<br>everybody else and we've got to worry<br>about the population so that's why I<br>wanted close been talking about an<br>alternative and complementary strategy<br>which was put forward by someone who<br>taught me called Geoffrey Rhodes who<br>said when we're dealing with issues like<br>diabetes which are societal problems<br>which are driven by behaviors which<br>shared and our collective like diet and<br>physical activity don't let's<br>concentrate only on finding people at<br>high risk let's try and shift the whole<br>distribution to the left so when we talk<br>about individual level diabetes<br>interventions we talk about five things<br>we want to change that your level of<br>obesity physical activity how much fiber<br>you eat how much saturated fat and how<br>much total fat and in the trials if you<br>achieve four or five of those success<br>scores<br>nobody gets diabetes and that's also<br>true<br>in the general population in our studies<br>in lower risk people if you achieve all<br>five of those behavioral scores nobody<br>goes on to get diabetes so what is<br>important for high-risk people is the<br>same for the whole population so why are<br>we thinking of diabetes risk only being<br>some people are not everybody we are all<br>at risk because we all share the wider<br>environment in which we live so this is<br>marginally technical but if you compare<br>this is a high risk approach and people<br>this is the risk of going on to get<br>diabetes it's 32 per thousands very high<br>and this sort of intervention if you<br>focused in on people who are sedentary<br>obese and had a family history or over<br>55 that would find high risk people but<br>this number here this is a measure of<br>how much of the diabetes epidemic would<br>be affected and it's tiny if you could<br>do something at the other end that<br>affected everybody who was sedentary<br>just by things that I'll talk about in a<br>minute the risk is much lower but<br>because the risk reduction is shared by<br>everybody<br>in total the impact on the diabetes<br>epidemic is 9 times as great so really<br>the only way we're going to deal with<br>this diabetes epidemic is recognizing<br>that it's a societal problem and<br>treating it like one so that means we<br>have to do different research we have to<br>move away from thinking that<br>way we eat the way we are physically<br>active is a matter of a matter of our<br>attitudes and preferences a person<br>choice and I would say we also have to<br>avoid words like lifestyle because that<br>intrinsically is saying it's a choice<br>it's a lifestyle it's not it's a<br>behavior that's driven by other things<br>by the layout of our schools by our<br>workplaces by the macro wider<br>environment and policy and we need to do<br>research that tackles that and try and<br>think about what is the research base<br>are shifting this distribution to the<br>left now it's a shame that ministers had<br>to leave but I'm sure someone can tell<br>them that if you contrast population and<br>high-risk approaches you also need to<br>contrast what we call low agency and<br>high agency interventions and what<br>agency is is if you had a population<br>approach you could for example not in<br>this context but you could put fluoride<br>in tap water that's a population<br>approach and it's got low agency you<br>don't have to engage in it because<br>everybody drinks the water from their<br>town but front of pack nutrition<br>labeling it affects everybody because we<br>all can look at the things but whether<br>it has any impact on you requires you to<br>do something and that's called eight<br>high agency and in general high agency<br>interventions widen inequalities so what<br>we need to be looking for is these low<br>agency interventions things we can do<br>for everybody without them having to<br>think about it now this brings us to it<br>to the end to this problem of the nature<br>of evidence and I want to share with you<br>a comment that was made in a book<br>chapter that I reviewed in the United<br>States about prevention<br>so they said and shrieky I'm not getting<br>at all Americans so they said we'll<br>review and discuss randomized controlled<br>trials of prevention using behavioral or<br>drugs we don't consider non randomized<br>things and reducing average BMI that's a<br>obesity or increasing activity in a<br>population would be expected to reduce<br>the incidence<br>of diabetes and actually might benefit<br>more people than high-risk approaches<br>unfortunately testing this hypothesis is<br>exceedingly difficult if not impossible<br>and we are aware of no direct evidence<br>to inform public policy now I'm leading<br>a lots of global Commission on diabetes<br>I have to say that is a recipe for<br>inaction inertia and doing nothing and<br>so we have to say no to that sort of<br>statement and the problem is that we've<br>been schooled in a way of thinking about<br>evidence where we do develop something<br>we do a pilot trial we do a trial we<br>synthesize the evidence and then we talk<br>to a minister and say you should take<br>action but when we're talking about<br>public health what we need is evidence<br>we need action on the basis of best<br>available evidence because we can't<br>randomize Auckland to be more active<br>than than Wellington you have to do<br>things in a non randomized way and what<br>you need is action early you need action<br>on the basis of best available evidence<br>and then evaluation and that requires<br>somebody to be bold because the type of<br>research we want is about how do we<br>change this environment and this<br>environment is impacting on on on our<br>diets and our obesity levels so we<br>measured people who were moving between<br>home and work in a big study and looked<br>at their environmental exposure to<br>takeaways and you can see this is the<br>difference in body mass index people who<br>are exposed to lots of takeaways between<br>home and work fatter and takeaways<br>expanding areas of socio-economic<br>deprivation they're targeted by<br>companies so what can we do we can map<br>those and then we can talk to<br>policymakers and we managed to support a<br>local authority in Britain in stopping<br>McDonald's putting a takeaway near a<br>school and so it's it's that evidence<br>coupled with action that we're looking<br>for<br>what about sugar sweetened beverages so<br>we know that in in our work that<br>if you have an average of one coke per<br>day more than somebody has none that the<br>risk of diabetes goes up by 25% so what<br>do you do about it what do you do is<br>like I did you put all the evidence<br>together they go towards the<br>parliamentary house of law House of<br>Commons Select Committee and actually at<br>the time nothing happened but a few<br>years later George Osborne who was then<br>the treasurer announced that we're going<br>to have a sugar levy in Britain this is<br>a right-wing government so we can change<br>what politicians do and we are sugar<br>levy starts in April and we are<br>evaluating it it's a sugar levy rather<br>than a tax and maybe we'll come back to<br>it in the questioning if you want to<br>know the difference but it's a very<br>complex thing because we don't know how<br>the companies are going to behave I said<br>we couldn't randomize Auckland and<br>Wellington to be different in terms of<br>physical activity but we can have<br>natural experiments where we invest in<br>cycling infrastructure in different<br>places and we have done that and shown<br>that in intervention towns the the rates<br>of cycling go up compared to comparisons<br>and we've also evaluated the health<br>effects of things like the the bicycle<br>sharing scheme in London to go from<br>observing impact on on physical activity<br>to say what is the impact on health so<br>what I'm trying to get at is it is<br>possible to do research it is possible<br>to produce evidence but in the end if<br>we're to do anything meaningful about<br>diabetes to shift this distribution in<br>the same way that we had politicians and<br>the head of our NHS thinking about<br>screening and early detection and high<br>risk approaches somebody like your<br>Minister is going to have to be bold and<br>take some action and I'd urge you to<br>encourage him to do that so I want to<br>close by echoing what Geoff said is<br>uncanny<br>but for me diabetes when I'm in a clinic<br>is a clinical manifestation of a<br>pathophysiological problem but when I've<br>got my public health hat on it's a<br>public health manifestation of a<br>societal problem and the societal<br>problem is one of unsustained<br>havea change its unsustainable and<br>attempting to deal with a societal<br>problem by treating it like a clinical<br>one we'll be resource intense you have<br>25 percent of your population with<br>pre-diabetes can you really afford to<br>treat all of those as patients and I<br>would say it's going to be if it was the<br>only approach it will ultimately be<br>unsuccessful and what you need is bold<br>political action based on best available<br>evidence followed by robust evaluation<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
