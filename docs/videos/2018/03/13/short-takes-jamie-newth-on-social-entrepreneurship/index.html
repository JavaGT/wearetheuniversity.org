uniquely suited to tackle 'wicked' social and environmental issues.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>social entrepreneurship is a challenging<br>thing to define because it captures a<br>big range of activities but at its heart<br>that's still entrepreneurship as you'd<br>understand it in a commercial<br>environment so it's about using<br>innovation to exploit opportunities and<br>that happens regardless of whether<br>you've got enough resources at the<br>outset and also it can happen in any<br>context we understand it and startups<br>most commonly but it can happen in any<br>kind of organization social<br>entrepreneurship there's all those<br>things but with a focus on trying to<br>address a social and environmental issue<br>at its heart as well social<br>entrepreneurs act where they see some<br>kind of failure whether it's by the<br>market in terms of not address providing<br>the the conditions for Humanity that we<br>would like or where government<br>intervention hasn't been successful<br>either and all we're not for profits or<br>NGOs typically intervene as well to<br>address these kinds of issues where<br>social entrepreneurship has a powerful<br>but complementary role to play is that<br>generally they're not constrained by<br>particular modes of operating that<br>traditional businesses or traditional<br>not-for-profits or government policy<br>often is and so they can use models<br>which blend the the best of of different<br>models of trying to achieve the social<br>and environmental change so that leads<br>to quite innovative combinations of open<br>ways of doing things including combining<br>capital different types of capital with<br>different types of business models so<br>it's an exciting and compelling mode of<br>so one of the things that were great<br>examples of social entrepreneurship<br>globally which has achieved real scale<br>is the Grameen Bank model of<br>microfinance that's one of the more<br>famous models that led to Muhammad Yunus<br>the founder achieving and receiving a<br>Nobel Peace Prize but probably more<br>importantly than that he proved that<br>it's possible to lend to the poor and<br>provide them with banking services with<br>a opportunity for them to participate in<br>the economy whereas previously there<br>have been marginalized from that from a<br>global perspective that's a it's a great<br>example of social entrepreneurship<br>achieving scale in New Zealand we don't<br>have many examples of organizations<br>scaling like that but we've got some<br>exciting early-stage companies which are<br>proving the case one of which is thought<br>wired which takes a technological<br>approach to trying to dramatically<br>improve the quality of life for people<br>with severe disabilities so they take a<br>hid sensing helmet or hits it which will<br>sense the brainwaves of people that are<br>locked in because of disability or<br>injury and enable them to use that their<br>technology to communicate or control<br>devices so to increase their<br>independence and ability to interact<br>with the world around them so quite met<br>exciting commercial opportunity in terms<br>of the the technology and that its<br>ability to scale but also has a huge<br>impact on the quality of life of for<br>people for whom the market hasn't yet<br>served<br>the development of the social<br>entrepreneurship ecosystem in New<br>Zealand is we could say it's lagging<br>behind some of the other economies that<br>we would look to and care about what's<br>happening over there particularly the UK<br>and in North America the big reason why<br>the growth of this type of activity is<br>difficult is because it doesn't fit with<br>what's normal<br>we have institutionalized that<br>traditional businesses have shareholder<br>primacy that drives the bulk of their<br>behavior and that the addressing of<br>social and environmental issues is done<br>by not-for-profits and charities so<br>we've got this binary kind of model<br>social entrepreneurs are violating that<br>to some extent because they're blending<br>the principles of business and the<br>practise of businesses with the impact<br>measurement models and the understanding<br>of issues but there was traditionally<br>you belong to the charity and<br>not-for-profit sector so their capital<br>the way their capital flows within an<br>economy the way that our legislation is<br>set up in our laws and regulations set<br>up around that binary model so this<br>creates challenges for anyone who's<br>hybrid so at the big picture that's one<br>of the one of the big challenges what<br>we've seen that's been successful in<br>catalyzing and supporting the growth of<br>social entrepreneurship is there's a<br>number of things<br>government's played a strong role and<br>creating the the space for the stuff to<br>happen that can be exists as particular<br>policies which catalyze capital and or<br>incentivize investors to invest in these<br>kinds of businesses to provide legal<br>frameworks to incorporate in a type of<br>legal legal form or organization which<br>encompasses both the social<br>environmental with the commercial and<br>increasingly it requires some leadership<br>across leadership from investors to say<br>actually you know I want to invest in a<br>way which aligns with not only with the<br>commercial or financial returns that I'm<br>looking for but with the the change I<br>want to see in the world as well so that<br>flow of capital is crucial for for<br>scaling these ventures so it does take<br>an ecosystem it's not a particular one<br>particular lever you can pull it so it's<br>a number of factors interacting well<br>social entrepreneurship is a very<br>rewarding activity you've got all the<br>benefits that any other entrepreneur<br>would realize in terms of pursuing a<br>passion and of<br>18 solving a problem that social<br>entrepreneurs have the the motivation<br>than the excitement of trying to grapple<br>with some of those wicked problems which<br>are really troubling us and in a global<br>sense as a society so the rewards are<br>you know which really trying to change<br>things we're trying to make create<br>systemic change so it's a rewarding<br>activity in and of itself but then<br>you've got also as employers you create<br>an environment where people are able to<br>align their talent with their passion<br>and what they find meaningful work<br>creates a significant competitive<br>advantage when you're attracting talent<br>so I think the core of why people should<br>do social entrepreneurship and continue<br>to be excited about it is because you've<br>got that that real alignment between<br>your talent and what you find is as<br>meaningful work and and being able to<br>create create change in the world
