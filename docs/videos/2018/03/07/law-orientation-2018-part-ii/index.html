0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so Kyoto congratulations and welcome to<br>part 2 orientation so I'm Jemima one of<br>the law advisers at the Student Center<br>so I'll be emceeing home welcome so just<br>an overview of today's program we'll<br>begin with the welcome from the Dean of<br>law Andrew Stockley followed by the<br>structure of a lobby part 2 by Professor<br>Warren swing we will then hear from the<br>course directors of your part 2 courses<br>this will then be followed by study<br>techniques and tutorials by Professor<br>Warren Swain we will then have your<br>introductory lecture for law 2 9 8 by<br>Stephanie car we will then hear from<br>quarter Higgins our careers advisor and<br>then we'll hear from Kiley Ryan from<br>University Health and counseling on<br>well-being Julie Julia told me will then<br>present on a safe inclusive and<br>supportive law school as well as hunter<br>well burg and then we'll have an<br>introduction to student societies<br>followed by your barbecue so it's my<br>pleasure to introduce our first speaker<br>on behalf of all the academic staff at<br>the law school can I just say<br>congratulations because you know from<br>everything you had to go through last<br>year that only a minority of students<br>who do first-year law get through into<br>second year law and so I know there's a<br>lot of strain there's a lot of work that<br>you've had to do and so very well done<br>on being here you'll find unfortunately<br>that it doesn't get easier once you do<br>get into second year so second year law<br>is also quite challenging one of the<br>reasons is in first year law of course<br>you learn about how to read cases how to<br>read statutes and then in second year<br>law if you've already got the case books<br>you would have seen there's a heck of a<br>lot of cases and some of them are quite<br>long and so what do you need to do<br>because law is all about the development<br>of the law the way in which Parliament<br>the way in which the courts and develop<br>our law and to be effective lawyers or<br>to be effectively trained in the law you<br>need to actually be able to use that<br>material in to work out what the law is<br>from it so therefore it'll be very<br>important during the course of the year<br>there'll be a heck of a lot of reading<br>but they'll also be coming to terms with<br>I think a whole lot of the key concepts<br>as to what the law is about so there's a<br>whole lot of I think conceptual thinking<br>that takes place at second year in my<br>own subject in public law all sorts of<br>concepts like the rule of law the<br>separation of powers and in the United<br>States at the moment there's all sorts<br>of questions about the rule of law and<br>the separation of powers but then how<br>does that apply in our own jurisdiction<br>the legal and constitutional place of<br>the treaty of waitangi all of these are<br>really big questions you'll be looking<br>at in public law in torts concepts<br>include the duty of care what is<br>causation in criminal law what is the<br>difference between strict or absolute<br>liability offenses in contract law what<br>exactly as an offer and acceptance of a<br>contract what is consideration so<br>there's a whole lot of conceptual<br>thinking that needs to take place<br>there's also a whole lot of practical<br>dimensions in second year law as well<br>I've already mentioned the fact that<br>you're learning how to derive the law<br>yourself from the materials from the<br>writings of judges scholars in the<br>statutes of Parliament<br>but there is we have instituted about<br>two years ago I think a course on legal<br>writing research and communication and<br>that's because no matter what you learn<br>about the law what you're going to need<br>to do when you go out and all sorts of<br>different careers is to be able to apply<br>it to be able to communicate it to be<br>able to write about it and so what<br>you'll find the net course is there's a<br>whole lot of practical hands-on<br>exercises where you draft you know<br>client memorandums or if you draft a<br>statement of claim for the court so<br>there's a whole aid you take part in the<br>negotiation exercise so it's again how<br>do you actually use what you've learned<br>and be and be able ultimately to talk<br>about the law of clients or to judges or<br>with other lawyers so all in all at all<br>aspects what I'm saying is there's quite<br>a lot of continued hard work an<br>application that is needed and so when I<br>look at students who succeed from second<br>year onwards and those who sometimes<br>don't I mean I think it's fairly obvious<br>the sorts of things that will be<br>important but I'll just say them very<br>briefly the first one is tuning up to<br>your classes your tutorials and your<br>lectures because in the end of the day<br>if you develop those good habits and by<br>the look of some of the smear bags of<br>whatever's inside those Auckland law<br>school bags I'm a few people may have<br>not to develop that good hair but<br>already might have overslept this<br>morning after orientation events the<br>night before I don't know but whatever<br>the case actually turning up to your<br>classes hearing what the people who are<br>experts in the field and who are going<br>to be seeking your examinations are<br>actually have to say about the law is an<br>incredibly good habit because ultimately<br>if you don't turn up in court when your<br>client is due to appear your client<br>loses the cases if you don't turn up<br>when there's a meeting between two<br>companies and you're representing one of<br>the companies you're never employed<br>again so it's very useful to get into<br>that sort of habit and straight off and<br>it's amazing that some people don't<br>though when you go to your lectures you<br>will see some empty seats but those are<br>the people who you know won't be on the<br>other side when you go into legal<br>practice ultimately but preparing for<br>the class is also absolutely important<br>so I would say you know when you do get<br>readings when you are told that a<br>certain case or statute will be looked<br>at read it in advance because if you're<br>sitting there making notes and you have<br>no idea actually what the lecture is<br>talking about they can't always go at<br>the level of simplicity that means you<br>know you haven't bothered to do what is<br>necessary because at the end of the day<br>you have a whole lot of hours every week<br>that aren't taken up by the classes so<br>get in that habit of reading the<br>materials in advance so you understand<br>what's being talked about because that<br>actually will make it a lot simpler and<br>a lot clearer and again that's again a<br>useful habit for employment later on<br>because ultimately this is an<br>opportunity you have that opportunity<br>won't come again because if you don't<br>get through part to law if you crash and<br>burn you know there's all sorts of<br>consequences to that to being able to<br>continue to do law or not but equally if<br>your knowledge is fuzzy if it's blurred<br>or it's unclear because you didn't put<br>the work in that equally is not going to<br>be very good and for your developing an<br>enthusiasm for the law or an ability to<br>practice it well but anyway you have got<br>through the biggest hurdle thus law<br>school can offer so as far as the<br>message and what I was just saying is<br>don't stuff it up now you will find<br>there's a whole wealth of opportunities<br>here available to you you have joined or<br>you are now part of a law school that is<br>unconditionally unashamedly<br>the best in this country we are ranked<br>among the top 30 law schools in the<br>world in the 2018 rankings and given<br>that there are some 5,000 law schools<br>around the world I think that's a really<br>incredible tribute to the caliber of our<br>academic staff in to the caliber of our<br>students and what they go on to achieve<br>we have the highest entry standards in<br>New Zealand as you'll be aware of but<br>they'd also means you'll have a really<br>good cohort with you and you should be<br>able to proceed at a faster and better<br>place than in some other places and<br>employers will prize that here you have<br>the largest range of am degree an<br>undergraduate elective so when you get<br>through the stage to compulsions you'll<br>find there's a whole raft about 50<br>electives each year that you have to<br>choose from<br>there'll be the opportunity later in<br>your degree to go on a student exchange<br>to do a semester of law at another top<br>law school around the world and about<br>one fifth of our code of our final year<br>cohort do that so really do seriously<br>consider that was I think that can be<br>transformative open people's eyes to<br>how Laura's practiced elsewhere and<br>there's all sorts of internship<br>opportunities as well in international<br>courts and another other opportunities<br>and to take advantage of that talk to<br>the student advisors you know if an<br>finance is an issue there's all sorts of<br>ways and to try and make those sort of<br>things possible to people who would like<br>to take part there are of course a whole<br>raft of clubs and societies that you can<br>join here the Oakland University Law<br>student society IDSA I'll be coming and<br>speaking to you later about all of the<br>academic workshops all of the social<br>drink all of the sporting sort of events<br>that they will be putting on but again I<br>know that they have you know a whole lot<br>of a whole lot of things about careers<br>workshops academic programs it begins<br>just that getting to meet everyone else<br>because in the end you're in a cohort of<br>three hundred and eighty other students<br>in the more people that you get to talk<br>to in lectures in tutorials and in the<br>sort of social and other events that are<br>organized I think you know then you find<br>people you can talk to you can ask<br>questions about the courses that you're<br>doing and they also make things quite a<br>lot easier going on we have a wonderful<br>competition program so again do think of<br>taking part and some of those practical<br>schools activities that are available<br>from witness examination to client<br>interviewing to wit to routine and<br>mooting of courses mock advocacy mock as<br>if you're appearing and a lawyer and a<br>court and I think when I look at it<br>we've got you know by far the most<br>extensive mooting program of any of the<br>law schools in this country we've seen<br>students who do very well to a variety<br>of international competitions and again<br>I think it says something for and the<br>way in which people really can develop<br>their advocacy skills here the most<br>prestigious mooting competition in the<br>world is the Jessup international law<br>meeting competition and last year to<br>Auckland University students were ranked<br>the best speaker in the world and the<br>food beer speaker of the world which<br>really are truly exceptional achievement<br>so hopefully if some of you get involved<br>it's the beach mat that you have to<br>aspire to<br>it proves finally just on clubs and<br>societies again I'm aware there's a<br>whole raft of other clubs and societies<br>Torico Tory our Pacific Islands loss<br>it's Association I know provide very<br>close supportive communities for our<br>Maori and Pacific students and so that's<br>really important you know to become<br>involved in that and to become involved<br>in the work that those societies do our<br>rainbow law society I know again is a<br>close and supportive environment for<br>LGBTQ students we have the Auckland<br>University Law Review is a law reviewer<br>published Law Review that is run<br>entirely by students edited by students<br>and entirely publishing student work and<br>it's looked at by the judges it's looked<br>at by people but members of the<br>profession so again that's something you<br>can become involved with we do have<br>another Law Review which some of you may<br>have attended last year which i think is<br>singing dancing caricatures and the like<br>but again it's been very successful over<br>the years some of the videos they've<br>produced have been seen by millions of<br>people worldwide when their sort of<br>parody rap songs and the like and I<br>think that's probably a greater sort of<br>I don't what you call it exposure to<br>greatest of uptake rate than many of the<br>articles published by academics if you<br>can reach millions of people through<br>those sorts of videos but the again<br>there's a lot of fun and enjoyment to be<br>had and perhaps the last Society I've<br>mentioned as the equal justice project<br>which again a lot of students get<br>involved with and do really good work<br>helping out in community law centers<br>looking at giving legal advice to<br>charitable organisations that can't<br>afford the cost of lawyers and again<br>looking at how can the most vulnerable<br>members of our society be assisted and<br>how can law students here assist in<br>providing legal advice to people who<br>cannot afford it<br>we of course also have a raft of<br>societies for international students and<br>all sorts of other areas so what I'm<br>saying at the end is work hard get<br>involved take advantage of all of the<br>opportunities that the you are here<br>because certainly don't glide on the<br>surface there is no excuse for<br>mediocrity because you have an<br>incredible opportunity having got<br>through into part to law and if you make<br>a real commitment if you open your minds<br>I think you'll find law can transform<br>your thinking law permeates all areas of<br>society we have banking lawyers<br>takeovers lawyers we have sports lawyers<br>we have entertainment lawyers we have<br>lawyers who deal with problems in the<br>health system because every area of Lee<br>of activity in society if there is an<br>issue if there's a problem if someone's<br>not doing what they should it is the law<br>that can be brought in to address it<br>when there are major issues of iniquity<br>and social injustice it's the law that<br>can be brought in to redress it so just<br>remember that a law degree does enable<br>you to step out and to take on<br>challengers in any particular area and<br>that probably is why you'll find about<br>half of our law students go directly<br>into legal work and about half of our<br>law students go into all sorts of other<br>careers and that's something in fact<br>we're very proud about because people<br>from this law school are leaders in all<br>areas of society yes some induct judges<br>free of the five judges on the Supreme<br>Court including occluding the Chief<br>Justice our Auckland Law School<br>graduates and the Chief Justice I think<br>is coming to speak here at the law<br>school in a few weeks time to look out<br>for the notice on that take advantage of<br>going to hear her into question who and<br>because we're hoping to get a number of<br>judges and to talk about their careers<br>and about what they see is important in<br>the law during the course of this<br>particular in the major law firms but we<br>also have people who have found that<br>learning about the law learning those<br>skills of analysis of reasoning of<br>writing can be incredibly important for<br>them in all sorts of areas so we hear<br>people who are business leaders the<br>chief executive of the Virgin Group who<br>works who's Richard Branson's number two<br>person the chief executive the<br>Commonwealth Bank of Australia our our<br>graduates people who heed local hospital<br>boards who hit transport authorities are<br>our graduates if you look at Parliament<br>I think of the National Party leadership<br>containers they seem to be even more of<br>them every day but at least two of them<br>are our graduates from the DP prime<br>minister to other members of cabinet<br>they are our graduates when I looked at<br>the new MPs elected to Parliament last<br>year 15% of the new MPs were graduates<br>of this law school and across<br>Parliament's are whole one and ten<br>members of parliament as a graduate of<br>this law school now in some ways you do<br>worry why is that the behavior in<br>Parliament's not better<br>why is that some of the results you know<br>aren't what we would achieve if we're<br>stocking one and teen but I think it<br>does show that there are people who want<br>to do things who have used a law degree<br>from this place and have gone on to try<br>and do things in society generally so I<br>mean those who aren't concerned I<br>suppose with heaviness is immediate and<br>impact on society or earning lots of<br>money of course there is the possibility<br>of an academic career so we have of<br>course the possibly of becoming a<br>professor and academic in the law school<br>so there's all sorts of ways in which<br>you can use the law but either way well<br>done take up the challenge I trust that<br>you enjoy this year and you enjoy the<br>rest of the day and on behalf of my<br>colleagues well done on getting into<br>second to your law welcome to you all<br>my name's professor Warren Swain I'm the<br>associate dean academic teaching and<br>learning which makes me responsible for<br>all our undergraduate teaching and<br>assessment those of you who are studying<br>contract will have the unfortunate and<br>dubious pleasure of me at 8:00 a.m. in<br>the morning<br>sadly my office did not allow me to pull<br>rank a move the lecture slot to a more<br>civilized time<br>but there we are I will begin as Sedin<br>did by congratulating you on reaching<br>part two as you know the demand for<br>places vastly outstrips the supply the<br>consequences they're worth having a high<br>entry standard are both good and bad in<br>the sense that they give rise to a deal<br>of anxiety but there are positive<br>aspects of this too notably the<br>advantages that it gives you in terms of<br>your employment prospects so to all of<br>you who've worked very hard to get to<br>this point I would take this opportunity<br>to congratulate you<br>so where do we go from here I'm going to<br>say something about the degree structure<br>very briefly but in your bags<br>you ought to have this document the<br>auckland law school handbook<br>and you'll see if you turn to page 12 of<br>that handbook that there is a diagram on<br>the structure of the LLB you'll note<br>that as a professional degree it's<br>structured rather differently to the<br>general bachelor's degree such as the BA<br>the beak on the BSC etc and that's<br>because there are certain courses that<br>you need to take in order to meet the<br>requirement of the New Zealand Council<br>for legal education the law degree<br>consists of a mixture of compulsory and<br>elective courses the compulsory courses<br>are in blue and the elective courses are<br>in red on the diagram you'll see that<br>part two consists entirely of compulsory<br>courses so legal research and writing<br>and other communication which 10 points<br>is the first one you must take whatever<br>else you are doing so you need to enroll<br>in law two nine eight<br>then you'll note that there are criminal<br>public talks and contract each weighed<br>at thirty points and then as we move to<br>part three there's a mixture of<br>compulsory in elective courses and part<br>four apart from a means of checking that<br>you've done enough writing and<br>participated in Moot and so on in law<br>for nine eight part four consists<br>as for the elective courses you don't<br>need to take a specific number of them<br>the elective courses come in three sizes<br>what matters here is the number of<br>points rather than the number of<br>electives and part four consists only of<br>elective courses so each year there are<br>around 50 to choose from some of which<br>are in the summer school typically four<br>or five others are in the first and<br>second semester as the denoted it's also<br>possible for students to go on exchange<br>to universities overseas and around as<br>he noted if if do so there are specific<br>exchange arrangement with other law<br>schools and there are the general<br>university exchange agreements that the<br>University of Auckland participating<br>there are actually in all around a<br>hundred possibilities that are available<br>to you and you are able to get credit<br>from those courses in other<br>jurisdictions for your ll be back in<br>Auckland<br>in respect of the co joint degree<br>student which is almost all of you the<br>structure is set out for you in the in<br>the document on out so in the handbook<br>on page 14 you'll note though that it<br>says a sample code joint degree<br>structure in other words a typical Co<br>joint degree structure so while some<br>students beginning part 2 as most of you<br>are take criminal and public alongside<br>legal writing and communications it's<br>not necessary for you to do so um some<br>of you won't do so as long as you're<br>doing legal research writing and<br>communication and at least one other<br>course then your enrollment is entirely<br>valid and there's no need to worry that<br>you don't follow the exact arrangement<br>in this diagram if you're unsure about<br>enrollments or what you need to do in<br>relation to enrollment then you should<br>seek the advice of the Student Center<br>they will be very happy to assist you in<br>questions relating to the structure of<br>your degree there is though one myth I'd<br>like to dispel and that's this you are<br>not required to complete all of part two<br>before taking courses that fall under<br>but a word of warning here that many of<br>the part 3 courses have prerequisites so<br>if a course has a prerequisite that<br>means that you must have completed an<br>earlier course before you are able to<br>enroll prerequisites are necessary<br>because courses at park 3 and 4 build on<br>existing knowledge before you really can<br>get a grip of that course note though<br>that there are different prerequisites<br>for different courses and you should<br>check this very carefully it is<br>extremely unlikely accepting the most<br>exceptional circumstance that I will<br>waive the prerequisite requirement that<br>as I say is for the very simple reason<br>that those later courses build on<br>earlier knowledge and if I waive the<br>requirement you won't have the requisite<br>knowledge to undertake the later course<br>now last year we went through all those<br>courses very carefully in discussion<br>with the course directors to ensure that<br>all of those courses had carefully<br>thought-out prerequisites so just as you<br>go into the degree further down the line<br>just make sure that you check that<br>carefully it's not an immediate concern<br>for you now because you're in part two<br>but just that this year at the beginning<br>of part 2 but just make sure that when<br>the time comes you check that quite<br>carefully<br>the other thing I just like to briefly<br>mention as part of the degree structure<br>and for something now that seems long in<br>the future is the honors degree program<br>the honors degree program is different<br>to the honours degree programming of the<br>faculties in that it's shorter it has<br>fewer credit however it still stands out<br>a non as an honors degree admission to<br>the honors program is on the basis of<br>your grades in earlier courses an<br>on your law courses as I say that's<br>something to bear in mind for now but<br>the honest course is taught by a seminar<br>and then there is a fifteen thousand<br>word research dissertation I just don't<br>like to finish by saying a few points<br>about housekeeping at least housekeeping<br>being a euphemism for faculty and<br>university regulations this point<br>people's eyes usually glaze over I have<br>to say I find regulatory matters highly<br>fascinating indeed I spend most of my<br>spare time on university committees<br>dealing with such matters however for<br>your purposes we've gone into and we've<br>gone to some trouble I've gone to some<br>trouble setting out the regulations as<br>they apply to you within the pages of<br>the handbook<br>which I should add is also available to<br>the website online it that easier so<br>quite why anyone wouldn't want this by<br>their bird I'm not quite sure<br>and the important at least smells nice<br>as all new publications do the important<br>bit for your purposes begins at page 30<br>academic information for students I just<br>simply because I really really really<br>want to avoid any of you falling foul of<br>these regulations the first is in<br>relation to penalties penalties are<br>applied for late the late submission of<br>work and for work that is over the word<br>limit note for the word limit purposes<br>that footnote count for word limit so<br>there's a little box on a word document<br>to include the footnotes in the word<br>count please ticket the second thing I'd<br>like to highlight are extensions<br>I very well appreciate more than most<br>that there are a whole variety of<br>reasons why students might not be able<br>to submit their work on time a whole<br>variety very good reasons why students<br>may not be able to submit their work on<br>time if you are unable to submit your<br>work on time you ought to go to the<br>Student Center<br>and meet with the student advisor the<br>student advisors are the ones who deal<br>with extensions not the course directors<br>the course lecturers or the tutors the<br>course directors however do have an<br>extremely important role in your<br>education in part to eat is the course<br>directors who should be your first port<br>of call with queries or questions<br>relating to the particular course over<br>which they are the course director I'm<br>very pleased at this point to introduce<br>the course directors from part two I am<br>going to be standing in for the course<br>director of part contract I am NOT<br>professor Dawson and I'll begin<br>we'll begin with criminal law and<br>professor Tommy thank you<br>kyaa Takato couture call Julia told me<br>tackle a I'm the course director<br>for criminal law and I'm here I'm<br>firstly going to add my congratulations<br>to getting into law school you guys are<br>very privileged I'm always of the view<br>that privilege comes with responsibility<br>and you're in for an amazing ride what<br>I'm gonna do today in the brief time<br>that I had to talk to you about criminal<br>law is firstly make a little bit of a<br>case for the relevance of criminal law I<br>don't have to you council for legal<br>education and said you have to study it<br>anyway but I know my colleagues and<br>they're all going to talk about how<br>their course is the most best and<br>amazing course in part two so I'll start<br>by doing that to criminal law and then<br>I'll just say make a few comments about<br>how the course is going to be taught<br>this year so we do know that one fifth<br>of you that go into legal practice are<br>going to practice criminal law if you<br>don't go into criminal practice you go<br>into government policy work or a range<br>of other areas criminal law is also<br>really relevant but even if you don't<br>say you go into company law or tax law<br>increasingly the criminal law is used to<br>back up and reinforce other regulatory<br>regimes so it's still good to know about<br>I'm going to slightly digress now and<br>read a letter from one of our alumni<br>which I received when I was editor for<br>Eaton Crescent which is our alumni<br>magazine goes out to all it'll follow<br>you around the world once you graduate<br>from Auckland and when I was able to<br>unit every year when there's a<br>particularly good addition I'd get<br>letters congratulating me on the<br>addition from alumni so this is one of<br>them written on December 2012<br>dear Julia I write to compliment you on<br>the 2012 edition of Eden Crescent and<br>then the author goes on to say which<br>articles he particularly enjoyed Thank<br>You Julia and editorial support team<br>much appreciated unfortunately for me I<br>am currently in cast<br>the in Mount Eden awaiting trial on a<br>raft of charges involving alleged<br>financial male practices and then he<br>goes on to sort of talk about the fact<br>that he's been denied bail and his<br>trials not a clear until 2014 end of<br>2014 war now now contemplate a guilty<br>plea enough of that I would have<br>convenient possible have back additions<br>of Eden Crescent the paucity of reading<br>material here is just fact so my point<br>in this is that not only my criminal law<br>be professionally relevant to you you<br>never know when it might be a personal<br>relevance there's something that I<br>always do and it's always interesting to<br>me I'm gonna segue now into a little<br>exercise it might take a little bit of<br>guts but I'm just gonna ask those of you<br>who have ever committed a criminal<br>offense in your lives to put your hands<br>up well we have some very honest human<br>beings<br>we also have a room full of highly<br>unusual and weird human beings basically<br>if you haven't put your hand up you've<br>never done one of the following things<br>you've never smoked marijuana you've<br>never taken ecstasy or one of the<br>designer party drugs gone to a dance<br>party you've never committed theft that<br>means you've never taken something<br>without someone's permission even if<br>you're hoping you won't damage it you<br>plan to return it<br>you've never assaulted someone that is<br>contacted the body on purpose without<br>their consent or threatened to do so<br>you've never used indecent or offensive<br>words in a public place<br>in other words worn in a public place<br>knowing someone could hear you you've<br>never said words to someone in a public<br>place and tinning to insult or offend<br>them<br>you've never urinated in the public<br>60% urinated in a public place rather<br>not a public toilet knowing that someone<br>could possibly observe you you've never<br>attempted to bring into hatred or<br>contempt or excite disaffection against<br>your majesty or the government of New<br>Zealand you've never attempted to do any<br>of those things so I think this little<br>exercise is interesting because if we're<br>honest basically if someone doesn't<br>haven't put their hand up they're<br>actually weird<br>seriously unusual to get to your early<br>20s and not having performed one of<br>these actions the exercise is<br>interesting because it tells us what<br>criminologists started to discover in<br>the seventies which is that criminal<br>offending is normal in the population<br>and that there's a huge body of what we<br>call the dark figure of crime which is<br>criminal offending that is never charged<br>and never ends up in the criminal<br>justice system so basically most of us<br>have had lives that have insulated us<br>from being charged or convicted being<br>processed through the criminal justice<br>system even though we've breached the<br>criminal law often multiple times in our<br>that's an interesting thought to take<br>into the study of criminal law to think<br>about why that is unfortunately for our<br>alumni who sent me that everybody<br>increase and those insulating factors<br>had ceased to operate in his particular<br>life so actually the study of criminal<br>law is immediately unperson aliy<br>relevant to all of us because in a sense<br>we've all committed criminal offences we<br>just haven't heard the label criminal<br>attached to us so turning now to say a<br>few words about criminal law we're going<br>to teach it in three streams this year<br>so class sizes will not be too large I<br>hope we have a fantastic teaching team<br>obviously I'm course director we also<br>have dr. flirtier who teaching who<br>taught it last year dr. Kate Doolin<br>who's a highly experienced teacher and<br>from a law that we've just secured from<br>the University of Birmingham and dr.<br>Anna hood and this is a team of teachers<br>that has a huge interest in restorative<br>justice alternatives to incarceration<br>and in the case of dr. flu to our<br>moldy and moldy approaches to justice<br>and indigenous human rights so what we<br>do in this course is we teach basic<br>criminal principles how you analyze the<br>criminal offense and understand its<br>legal requirements we cover a selection<br>of the most serious offenses and<br>defenses we cover different ways in<br>which you can be liable and we deal with<br>sentencing law so we have lectures that<br>you must attend in three streams you<br>have to stay in the lecture that you're<br>assigned to and we teach sentencing law<br>in the tutorial program and we've<br>revised something we were doing at some<br>point with a great deal of success and<br>that is the sentencing modes and<br>tutorials so in the tutorial program you<br>will learn basic sentencing principles<br>you will then produce a written<br>sentencing formation and an oral<br>sentencing submission in front of a<br>judge and the final part of the tutorial<br>program will be exam preparation<br>three factual problems so I look forward<br>very much to seeing you next week so now<br>I'd like to introduce professor Janet<br>McLain to speak on public law tena<br>koutou tena koutou tena koe so Carter<br>called Janet McLain tnn it's my great<br>pleasure to welcome you add my words of<br>welcome to those that you've already<br>heard to law school I'm not so<br>interested in criminal law though we<br>talk a bit about criminal law because<br>it's a branch of public law so we you<br>know we'd like to bring everyone into<br>the into our realm if you like and I<br>don't just didn't power its what I'm<br>interested in I'm interested what kind<br>of power it is how legitimate it is how<br>its defined by the law and how you hold<br>power to account and thinking about<br>where you might end up people I went to<br>law school who I was sitting next to on<br>a day like today one of my friends from<br>those first weeks of law school is now<br>caught of the appeal judge but another<br>of those friends who I went to law<br>school with is now the Minister of<br>Justice now between those two who has<br>more power what sort of power do they<br>have how do they exercise it and who<br>gets to hold them to account that's what<br>we're interested in and public law and<br>that's the way that we've structured the<br>teaching for this year and the first<br>half of the year we look at the<br>different institutions of New Zealand<br>government we look at the legislature<br>we'll look at the judiciary what happens<br>when a judge goes bad how do you hold a<br>bad judge to account we'll look at the<br>executive power executive authority and<br>it's<br>say that people don't really go for<br>public and the first semester I know<br>because I taught in the second semester<br>last year and people said you're so good<br>it's better than the first semester well<br>this year I'm teaching the first<br>semester so that's my challenge right I<br>have to make the first semester more<br>interesting the reason why the second<br>semester is more interesting is that the<br>second semester you get to hold them to<br>account right so the second semester<br>we're looking at the Bill of Rights<br>we're looking at judicial review and<br>we're looking at the Treaty of Waitangi<br>so the second semester gets more<br>concrete it's starting to show you the<br>doctrines confine and and force<br>politicians to justify their power the<br>first half of the semester is more<br>setting up the stepping-stones the<br>structures that you need in order to<br>understand what's coming what are the<br>sources of legal authority that<br>governments exercise how are they<br>defined and how do they fit together how<br>much power does the court have and again<br>a system which has no written<br>constitution and what on earth does that<br>mean so that's what we're going to be<br>talking about and we have a great team<br>and public law as well publics going to<br>be taught on two streams and our team is<br>me I start off the year for the first<br>six or seven weeks and I'll be talking<br>about the legislature and introducing<br>you to the sources of law and then<br>you'll have dr. Unruh era Witte who will<br>teach you about the executive executive<br>sources of power and then John it will<br>talk about the judges and the Bill of<br>Rights he gets a sexy teaching this year<br>but that's right we'll try and get it<br>back from him next year and then dr.<br>Edward Willis will talk to you about<br>judicial review something you've<br>probably never heard of it's about<br>holding executive power to account and<br>has very broad applications and a whole<br>lot of different space<br>and then finally we will have a section<br>on the Treaty of Waitangi at the end and<br>the reason we do that a lot of people<br>find that mystifying we will talk a<br>little bit about the treaty at the<br>beginning of the year but we'll spend a<br>lot more time on the treaty at the end<br>of the year is because treaty<br>jurisprudence brings an international<br>law judicial review the Bill of Rights<br>rules about customary law T kana the<br>Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous<br>Peoples so we think that you're not<br>equipped to talk about the Treaty of<br>Waitangi and its fullness until you've<br>got through the whole of the year so<br>that's why we do it that way so I'm<br>looking forward to seeing you on Monday<br>if you look on canvas you'll find my<br>course outlines for the first seven<br>weeks you'll find powerpoints for the<br>first week and I expect that you will<br>have had a look at the case book as well<br>so I would like to now introduce Nicky<br>Chamberlin who'll speak unlawful hello<br>everyone my name is Nicky Chamberlain<br>and to start off no I am not from New<br>Zealand originally I'm from the south<br>and not South Island south of the United<br>States and no I did not vote for Trump<br>so all I can say about that is I'm sorry<br>and let's move on I have the privilege<br>to talk to you today about the law of<br>torts professor Jo Manning is the course<br>director for torts unfortunately she<br>could not make today and wanted me to<br>convey her apologies so I am here in her<br>place I am one of the lectures there's<br>four lectures in the torts class we each<br>take six weeks of lecturing so that's a<br>quarter of the class to tell you a<br>little bit about torts as a subject well<br>what we're interested in is money show<br>me the money and the reason we're<br>interested in money is because a tort is<br>a wrongful act by someone leading to<br>civil liability so a wrongful act by<br>someone leading to civil liability what<br>I mean by that well for example in<br>criminal law if you punch somebody okay<br>the crown can essentially bring a<br>prosecution for assault that doesn't get<br>you very far if you are on the receiving<br>end of the punch so what can you do well<br>you can bring private proceedings a<br>private prosecution for civil liability<br>and tort for the tort of battery yes it<br>has<br>name it is confusing you will learn lots<br>about this and torts but it's called<br>battery so that's an example of what a<br>tort is you'll start off with Marcus<br>Roberts if you're taking torts this year<br>Marcus is great he's going to be talking<br>about accident Compensation Scheme ACC<br>essentially why is it that New Zealand<br>has far more litigation<br>sorry far less litigation than the<br>United States reason being is here you<br>cannot sue for personal injury by<br>accident that's a whole bunch of fun<br>what is an accident what is personal<br>injury we'll be looking at all of that<br>sort of thing Marcus will be talking<br>about battery assault false imprisonment<br>trespass to land etc I will then swoop<br>in for the second half of the first<br>semester we will start by trespass to<br>Goods I will make that as exciting as<br>humanly possible I promise<br>I even throw in some MC Hammer can't<br>touch this in there you will find out<br>why then we will talk about defamation<br>privacy which are all very fun topics we<br>have cases relating to Catherine<br>zeta-jones Michael Douglas Naomi<br>Campbell the cool thing about topics<br>such as defamation but in particular<br>privacy is that normally if it's getting<br>to a litigation stage obviously there<br>has been some sort of public disclosure<br>of a private fact that they don't want<br>out in the open<br>guess what it's out in the open and we<br>get to read about it so that's all sorts<br>of fun second semester is negligence so<br>we've got basic negligence the first six<br>weeks so we have professor Joe Manning<br>and then associate professor Hanna<br>Wilberg who will be talking about<br>advanced negligence negligence<br>essentially comes down to the<br>intentionality so when you can sue<br>somebody but the intentionality is<br>lacking for example somebody does<br>something and it harms you they don't<br>to do it but they were negligent when<br>can they have liability when can you sue<br>so that's a brief summary of what we're<br>going to cover in the law of torts the<br>mechanics of it essentially taught three<br>times a week<br>Monday Wednesday Friday we were able to<br>secure lecturing from 11:00 to 12:00 and<br>3:00 to 4:00 I don't know how we did<br>that professor Swain somehow picked the<br>short straw but I will be there a box of<br>birds to see you at 11 a.m. course book<br>available I think a canvas notification<br>went around yesterday here is the first<br>semester one and all of its glory a very<br>beautiful blue color very calming feel<br>assessment we don't have plushies in<br>torts so unlike some of the other<br>compulsory subjects there is no plus<br>edge and I just want to touch on this<br>quickly because unlike some of the other<br>classes are marking Kate I've waiting is<br>a bit different we have a test which is<br>worth 20% again that's now plus egde we<br>have an essay worth 10% again no plus<br>äj-- then we have a moot for 5%<br>everybody will be required to do a moot<br>this is a great opportunity to try a<br>little bit of advocacy if that's<br>something that you're interested in<br>please do not stress about that there<br>will be support to assist you tutorial<br>attendance we give you points for<br>attending tutorials yay so basically<br>there's 5% for tutorial attendance and<br>you need to attend for compulsory<br>tutorials and then Dermot<br>that's the 5% you do not have to attend<br>other people's tutorials unless you want<br>to why would you want to well because<br>they're going to be arguing about things<br>that we're discussing in class and<br>clinics want to mention something about<br>this briefly there are four clinics in<br>the year they're optional they are taken<br>by yours truly I will be talking about<br>test preparation and one test feedback<br>in one essay preparation in one and exam<br>preparation in one essentially we will<br>be going over past exam problems test<br>problems and I will be giving some handy<br>hints to help you along the way you will<br>need to sign up for clinics on canvas as<br>I said it is optional<br>I will send around an message on canvas<br>shortly probably at the beginning of<br>next week so that you can all sign up<br>for class<br>lastly lecture recordings we've made a<br>decision as a group this year that we<br>will allow lecture recordings yay<br>however the little caveat to that is<br>that we're going to post them at the end<br>of the week and that's just to<br>incentivize people to attend the lecture<br>so they'll all be posted and one go at<br>the end of every week yeah I think that<br>that's basically it so it was lovely<br>meeting all of you I appreciate your<br>time and congratulations being a lawyer<br>is a real privilege and all of you are<br>now becoming part of the club so<br>congratulations and I will see you in<br>now I welcome back warrants trained to<br>speak on law of contract as well as<br>study techniques and tutorials along<br>with my other segments I'm here to say<br>something very briefly about the law of<br>contract as I noted I am NOT professor<br>Dawson though it was slightly<br>disconcerting in the teaching<br>evaluations the other year when<br>Professor Dawson and myself were<br>but there we are we've heard in some<br>detail about the phone and frivolity<br>excitement and relevance and importance<br>of the other part two courses my segment<br>is somewhat more a aurash but I would<br>note that of course contracts in reality<br>are the cart is the type of law that you<br>are much more likely to come into<br>contact with than any of the other kinds<br>assuming that you are not a recidivist<br>criminal offender then contracts are<br>something that you're used to dealing<br>with all of the time contract really<br>divides into two neat part in a sense<br>that and one can think of these two<br>parts in two ways one can think of them<br>as semester 1 &amp; 2 of course but one can<br>also think of the law of contract as a<br>relationship semester 1 is when<br>everything is marvelous<br>the Valentine's card has been received<br>the chocolates and flowers have been<br>exchanged the Dilla dates have been had<br>you have gazed lovingly into each<br>other's eyes I think we'll draw a veil<br>over the discussion at that point<br>bullets where everything's going well<br>everything is rosy and that's a bit like<br>the first semester of the law of<br>contract<br>it's where the parties are getting on<br>it's where the parties have entered into<br>an agreement it's about the mechanics of<br>semester to be inevitable the raus have<br>started the dates have be missed the<br>frustration has shown the performance<br>as with the law of contract the parties<br>are at loggerheads one is refusing to<br>perform or both are or worse one or both<br>are performing badly semester two deals<br>with the question of contract breach and<br>remedies that are available for breach<br>of that contract if you want to think of<br>it in another way you may think of<br>contract as being like dr. Jekyll and<br>mr. Hyde for those of you not familiar<br>with gothic novels I suggest that you<br>it is usually being taught in other<br>universities that I have taught the<br>subject in that I am more mr. Hyde than<br>dr. Jekyll however this year I am dr.<br>Jekyll this year I am teaching the<br>indeed in semester two I will be in<br>Cambridge on sabbatical but semester one<br>then consists of a contract formation<br>offer an acceptance consideration topics<br>like that semester two consists of the<br>remedies for breach etcetera I just say<br>there are more general word about the<br>main resources are found on the canvas<br>page you will have received a message<br>for me through canvas over the last<br>weekend alerting you to this the case<br>book is available as a PDF and also<br>available for purchase there is no set<br>course book though the recommended<br>reading if you are rich<br>East Burroughs Finn and Todd however the<br>library do have a number of copies of<br>those a new edition has come out I have<br>to say that the first chapter is greatly<br>improved given that there are extensive<br>professor stock Lee's point that<br>academic books are not widely read I<br>used to believe until I discovered that<br>some I won't use a bad word have pirated<br>my monograph and it is available on the<br>web as a pirated copy quite why anyone<br>would be interested in the law of<br>contract 1617 to 1870 is anyone's guess<br>but there we are<br>this course is unfortunately both case<br>and statute ethic<br>particularly in relation to semester to<br>statute is really important now I know<br>this seems boring and bits of contract<br>law are I'm afraid tedious much of life<br>I'm afraid is tedious almost my entire<br>existence history and I make this point<br>not just for the levity but to say to<br>you actually you really need to<br>persevere with this stuff if the case<br>doesn't make sense first time then you<br>need to look at it again and again if<br>necessary I'll give you some guidance<br>when I teach that part of the course<br>about those authorities I can't promise<br>any exciting details of the private life<br>of who I gather as some kind of b-list<br>celebrities however<br>what the cases are really about is<br>illustrating principles and it's<br>important that you engage with them<br>there aren't really any shortcuts<br>I'm afraid with this in my experience<br>over many years teaching law in three<br>different countries that the more<br>students put into it the more they get<br>out of it and actually it is a little<br>bit unfortunately of an endurance<br>testing that it's often the case one<br>finds that students initially they're<br>quite enthusiastic they will have read<br>the case book after about week two that<br>Peters off real life intervenes there's<br>more fun to be had than reading the<br>contract course book so I'm told but I<br>would urge you to just try and keep at<br>it<br>contract does make more sense once<br>you've done some of it it all makes it<br>all fits together it's not a subject<br>that's as equally discreet as possibly<br>some others are I'll do my best to make<br>at least my segments as entertaining as<br>possible<br>this is taught in two streams 8:00 a.m.<br>is one stream lis of this dream I think<br>for memories twelve to one you will have<br>me for the first five weeks until Easter<br>I will be followed by dr. Fairweather<br>who is joining us who has taught in<br>Australia and the UK for the remainder<br>of semester one and then professor<br>Dawson will be teaching you for all of<br>semester two in its entirety professor<br>Dawson is<br>an authority on what used to be the<br>contractual remedies act but which has<br>now been consolidated in a big statute a<br>couple of years ago last year I think<br>the contracting commercial Law Act so<br>you'll have the intricacies of the<br>legislation to look forward to in<br>semester two I did teach that material a<br>few years ago in semester two but I have<br>to say well you'll have that treat<br>coming just something very briefly on<br>the assessment assessment for this<br>course consists of four items there will<br>be a test I think for memory may there's<br>an essay there's a final examination and<br>there's tutorial attendant cheat oil<br>attendance is compulsory with the<br>deduction if you don't attend plus arch<br>does apply on this course but note in<br>order to get Prasad you have to submit<br>all of the assessment equally if you<br>even if you're not wanting plus arch the<br>tutorial essay is a compulsory course<br>requirement so in essence really given<br>all students want to be able to claim<br>plus arch you need to undertake all four<br>pieces of assessment in this course<br>please read very carefully the details<br>on that assessment as I set them out in<br>on the canvas page under the syllabus it<br>is assumed for the avoidance of doubt<br>that you have read the canvas page and<br>understand the syllabus I hope we'll<br>have no sympathy whatsoever in my<br>associate dean capacity if any student<br>claims they didn't understand what was<br>required of them on this course<br>consider yourself duly notified equally<br>on that point can I ask that can I note<br>that you will be sent emails through<br>canvas at various points on this course<br>please keep out and eye an eye out for<br>those emails um on that note I have<br>nothing more to add other than to say<br>you should have received an email about<br>the course reading for the first week of<br>the semester we will consider the<br>question of agreement beginning on<br>Monday morning at 8:00 a.m. and I trust<br>on Monday morning at 8:00 a.m. you will<br>all be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed<br>which is more than I will be the best<br>thereby sack and I know some of you are<br>commuting it so I only have to walk them<br>across the road but gallons of coffee<br>are usually a good idea I'll try my best<br>to make that part of the courses<br>entertaining as I can I'll try if I can<br>to read you some poetry as I happen to<br>as I have done in the past this part of<br>the course is recorded and the lecture<br>recordings are available as we taught<br>they will be available at the end of the<br>week in which the lectures are delivered<br>I would encourage you to attend the<br>lectures in any event even though you<br>can get the lecture recordings because<br>there may be some engagement there may<br>be it's actually in my experience saves<br>time attending the lectures because it's<br>easy just to think oh I can sit in bed<br>and listen to the lecture recordings and<br>that will be you know I absorb the<br>information<br>actually timewise I have to say my<br>experience I know it's a pain to get out<br>of bed especially in the middle of<br>winter when it's dark and raining but<br>actually it probably in the long run<br>saves time sitting here and assimilating<br>the information but I can't<br>of course insist you attend but I would<br>genuinely urge you to do so thank you<br>very much I think I follow again do I so<br>I'll just continue on to my next item<br>now I'm going to say something very<br>briefly about study techniques and<br>usual with a poem and this is a poem by<br>the great English poet WH Auden who many<br>of you will be aware of I've chosen<br>orden not because or Deniz my favorite<br>poet my favorite poet if any of you are<br>interested is AE Housman who is suitably<br> especially the later poems<br>Houseman if you learn nothing today it's<br>that you should go away and read some<br>poems of AE Housman<br>there are actually at the end of the day<br>some things more important than law and<br>poetry and art are two that immediately<br>spring to mind so if you pick up nothing<br>today it's that you go away and read a<br>Houseman not just the Shropshire lad<br>which is perhaps his best-known but some<br>of the later poems which are<br>heartbreakingly sad their concern<br>subjects such as love dis<br>appointment and failure if after reading<br>a house menu feel depressed I suggest<br>that you turn to my other great favorite<br>poet Philip Larkin who many of you will<br>also be familiar with but because you're<br>here at the beginning and we need<br>something a bit more cheerful let's<br>start with WH Auden WH Auden once wrote<br>law is like love in the poem he<br>contrasted different senses of the law<br>the law of nature the law of religion<br>etc he devoted a verse to the kind of<br>law that you're familiar with or already<br>familiar with and he said this law says<br>the judge as he looked down his nose<br>speaking clearly a most severely law is<br>as I've told you before lorries as you<br>know I suppose lorries but let me<br>explain it once more law is the law I<br>know nothing or certainly very little<br>about love so I can't really comment on<br>whether the comparison is a valid one<br>however it's worth reflecting on the way<br>in which the judge in Auden's poem<br>presents the law it's something certain<br>something definite the law is the law<br>and this is commonly how laypeople and<br>party student going into the law of<br>contract think about the law the laws<br>black and white it gives us answers it's<br>some kind of supercomputer<br>where everything is black and white and<br>there are no shades of grey the truth<br>I'm afraid is more complicated the law<br>is often contradictory<br>we've got authorities that contradict<br>each other there's a famous case that I<br>will don't teach this year but an<br>English Supreme Court case called the<br>Achilleas where two judges say one thing<br>to say of the total opposite and lord<br>Walker agrees with both make of that<br>what you will and it's interesting to<br>note that Lord Walker is not an idiot I<br>don't have that view about a large<br>number of English or indeed New Zealand<br>judges but law Walker certainly isn't in<br>that category so why good question I<br>have met Lord Walker twice and failed on<br>both occasions to ask him for an<br>explanation but more usual than that<br>actually is where judges reached the<br>same result of the decision but for<br>different reasons as he should be of<br>course familiar with them legal method<br>what we need to do is to try and make<br>sense of this complexity now last year I<br>talked to all of the course directors<br>from part two who indeed are the same as<br>this year and asked them to identify for<br>me what they think is important about<br>studying law to which I've added some of<br>my own thought between us is perhaps<br>evident<br>we all have considerable experience in<br>teaching law I would suggest more than a<br>century's worth between us which is<br>something of a frightening<br>thought so what's lesson number one<br>lesson number one as I've already<br>alluded to is the importance of the case<br>law you need to read the cases that are<br>contained in the case books there is a<br>misconception<br>sometimes among students in the three<br>countries I've taught law and I've<br>taught a wide variety of legal topics<br>including tort law land law equity<br>restitution I am a legal historian so I<br>teach a legal history elective Roman law<br>legal theory a whole lot of things but<br>amongst all of those students in all of<br>those subjects there are some students<br>who think that they can go to the<br>lectures write down what the lecturer<br>says and regurgitate that in the exam<br>and be awarded in a it doesn't impress<br>me that the student agrees with<br>everything I say or regurgitates<br>everything I say indeed in one<br>University when I was younger and not<br>going to seed one student thought it was<br>a good idea to cover their exam scripts<br>in hearts and write declarations of love<br>on it in the hope that that would get<br>them an A grade they sadly were<br>disabused of that notion when they<br>received their examination mark back but<br>it's an important point this you are at<br>this stage now where you should be<br>engaging with the material yourself you<br>should come to your own view on some of<br>the material I'm quite happy if people<br>don't agree with me I'd be quite worried<br>if you agree with me on everything that<br>would be worrisome but in order to<br>properly engage intellectually with the<br>myth<br>you need to read the cases all I can say<br>about that is it gets easier I remember<br>what it's like to start reading the<br>cases I may all seem old to you but I'm<br>not actually that old I read law in the<br>1990s not the 1890s and I remember what<br>it's like the kind of support one got in<br>Oxford colleges in the 1990s was that<br>who seemed to be an old man in twe<br>turned up we sat in an oak paneled room<br>he said here's your reading for the<br>first tutorial go away and read the<br>cases he gave us a list of about 60<br>cases to read in a week we were told to<br>go away and read them that was it we sat<br>there in the middle of the night in the<br>olden days before it was all online in<br>the college library at 3:00 in the<br>morning when days without sleep reading<br>the cases writing down everything in<br>them and of course it was hopeless we<br>didn't know what we were looking for we<br>just were writing everything down we<br>didn't know what was relevant we didn't<br>know what was relevant because we didn't<br>know how to read a case and we didn't<br>know how to read a case because we've<br>not had any practice in reading a case<br>the more you do it as I understand most<br>things the better more adroit you become<br>at the particular task in hand in other<br>words it will get easier and it you'll<br>notice at one point you suddenly feel<br>it's got really much easier but law of<br>course is about statutes as well for<br>some reason students are more frightened<br>of statutes even than of cases<br>you need to try and get over that<br>initial fear though I'd know that<br>statutes are frustrating even for those<br>of us who have experienced or<br>considerable experience in reading them<br>including law professors and including<br>judges no one at your stage is a fully<br>form lawyer it's really important not to<br>expect too much of yourself straightaway<br>I know that there's a little voice on<br>everybody's shoulder and it's important<br>to note this everybody has a little<br>thing that sits on their shoulder<br>telling them that they're not good<br>enough you need to find some kind of<br>technique for silencing that little<br>voice that we all have but it's really<br>important that you don't expect too much<br>too soon so just keep honestly you just<br>keep at it it's why partly these courses<br>span two semesters you'll find as you<br>get through semester one met probably<br>around the mid semester or even into<br>early semester two it will start to<br>become a bit easier it will start a bit<br>to make more sense it will seem a bit to<br>fit together more the lectures though<br>are designed to give the subject matter<br>hopefully some structure and to be an<br>introduction to crucial ideas as I'm<br>stressing here you need to be<br>responsible for your own learning so you<br>need to look at the cases before the<br>lecture you need to do reading before<br>they do too<br>in contract I given you a detailed<br>lecture handout which should provide you<br>with a structure for that material other<br>lectures will give you PowerPoint there<br>are some expectations about the work<br>that you do for each course which of<br>course depend on the credits that of<br>course is given but as a rough rule of<br>thumb for every hour spent in electoral<br>tutorial there should be three hours<br>work outside of it and that work outside<br>the classroom is critical but where do<br>you start well you start by attending<br>the lectures remember though it's only<br>possible to recall roughly around 20% of<br>what you hear I know it's tempting to<br>let your mind wander I know it's<br>tempting to send emails or go on to<br>something I'm told he's called Facebook<br>or to go and do your online shopping I<br>understand that temptation I really do I<br>spend a good deal of my working week<br>in a whole lot of university committees<br>some of which I have to confess Oh<br>extremely boring it's tempting not to<br>concentrate on the business in hand and<br>to deal with your emails I can't say I'm<br>very effe with online shopping although<br>I have used the Book Depository and<br>bought airline ticket but other than<br>that<br>actually concentration is a really<br>important skill for lawyers really<br>really really important and you need to<br>try and grass that skill this was really<br>brought to my attention when I worked at<br>the University of Queensland and I used<br>to judge moot some irregular basis with<br>judges the concentration that those<br>people had listening to the mooting was<br>absolutely extraordinary my mind was<br>wandering I was doodling I was thinking<br>about god knows what but the judges were<br>always always able to concentrate and<br>they're able to do that because that's<br>what they do day in day out they have to<br>sit there listening to this tedious<br>boring counts or rambling on before them<br>though I did hear an anecdote and this<br>is a judge he's long dead in Queensland<br>in the 1980s he used to have two things<br>under the bench when he was listening to<br>cases one was a magazine on woodwork<br>that he used to read and the other was a<br>glass of whiskey that he kept his<br>associate and a friend of mine was his<br>associate the job with the associate was<br>to keep topping up the whiskey those<br>days are gone and those days are gone<br>for you so really at one skill you do<br>need to develop it's a skill of<br>concentration a second skill you need to<br>develop it's a skill of taking note the<br>trick is identifying what's important<br>this of course is a vital skill for<br>lawyers and one that shouldn't be<br>overestimated<br>all the research on on pedagogy which is<br>a fancy word for saying teaching and<br>learning shows that it's best to be an<br>active learner and an active learner is<br>one that engages with the content you're<br>just not always you don't just sit there<br>as a reset<br>tickle and have all the information<br>poured over you active learning means<br>putting your own order on the material<br>it means reviewing your notes putting<br>them in a way that you can engage with I<br>know some students find drawing diagrams<br>and they like helpful and putting your<br>note from the lectures alongside your<br>own reading please don't begin this<br>process the night before the test or the<br>exam it needs to be an ongoing process<br>and an ongoing discipline if you think<br>and some of you in this room will think<br>that you can wing it and sit the night<br>before reading through your lecture<br>notes and get an A in the exam or in the<br>test all I can say is the best of luck<br>to you many students of course find<br>study groups helpful and I would say to<br>you that isn't necessarily a good sorry<br>isn't necessarily a bad idea some of you<br>of course may be tempted to use outside<br>cheating firms course that's entirely a<br>matter for you<br>though I would just stress two things<br>the first is that those firms and there<br>are a number of them do have no<br>connection whatsoever with the Faculty<br>of law or the University of Auckland the<br>second point to note is that they can<br>make no guarantee that their materials<br>are entirely aligned with the<br>and syllabus that can change from year<br>to year lecturers change different<br>people set the exams different people<br>mark the exams equally of course they're<br>not checking their materials for<br>accuracy or any of those things<br>inevitably as they're and all as their<br>organisations that are completely<br>separate form us that's just a fact it<br>I'm not making any pejorative statement<br>but I'm just you do well to remember<br>that and to say to that<br>we've got clinics in tort law as Nicky's<br>already said there'll also be clinics<br>that I forgot to mention which will be<br>taking place in the law of contract<br>which dr. Carr is running in semesters<br>one and dr. Fairweather he's running in<br>but I would urge you to attend them<br>students last year found them really<br>useful<br>well what we can do to help is really as<br>follows we offer the clinics on those<br>courses secondly you shouldn't be afraid<br>to go and talk to the lecturer if<br>there's anything in the lecture content<br>you don't understand you might put your<br>hand up in a lecture some students do<br>that that's fine you might go up to the<br>lecturer after the lecture that's fine<br>too<br>or you might go to their office hours<br>that's also fine too but please take<br>advantage of that opportunity the people<br>teaching those courses are there to<br>assist you and if there is something you<br>don't understand about the content ask<br>them no question is a stupid question<br>indeed many students say to me oh I<br>think this is probably a stupid question<br>it actually proves to be an extremely<br>incisive question if you're not unsure<br>about the content or don't find the<br>content in place is confusing that isn't<br>a sign of stupidity in fact it's a sign<br>of the reverse it's a sign of<br>intelligence rather than stupidity I<br>find some of the material confusing and<br>contradictory and illogical so don't<br>feel that this is a fault of yours<br>actually quite the opposite so make sure<br>that you take advantage of that resource<br>and talk to the course lecture there<br>seems to have been in the past some how<br>do I put this some rumor that I am<br>unwilling and unhelpful and do not like<br>seeing students this is completely<br>untrue I am always happy to see students<br>between 5:00 and 7:00 in the evening<br>most days other than a Friday so if any<br>of you are in Mike<br>horses please email me and make an<br>appointment to come and see me if you if<br>you don't want to come and see me<br>individually and need support with you<br>then come as a group that's absolutely<br>fine - but I mean that quite genuinely<br>I'm really very very happy to see any<br>student who wanted to talk to me about<br>the course content so don't feel that<br>I'm in some way too grand for you to<br>come and see and really it's the one<br>part of my job that I still enjoy is<br>talking to students about the course<br>content so please any of you who want to<br>please just Oh or get me after a lecture<br>the same is true of all of my colleagues<br>I don't expect most of my colleagues are<br>there at 7:00 in the evening most of the<br>rest of them have other lives but they<br>will equally be happy to see you<br>nevertheless I'd like to though just<br>then with a plea you should make the<br>most of University working for your<br>bullets shouldn't be everything I've<br>spent my whole life since I was 12 years<br>old at my desk working and have had a<br>whole heap of academic prizes and of the<br>youngest law professors in Australasia<br>etc etc bullying isn't everything<br>certainly if I had my time again I<br>wouldn't have spent my entire life since<br>I was 12 at my desk and this actually is<br>the most important thing I'm going to<br>say to you that you must take advantage<br>of all the wider things that University<br>has to offer you I mean this most kindly<br>and absolutely sincerely it shouldn't<br>just be about working there are a whole<br>lot of<br>opportunity social and other kinds of<br>opportunity though you'll also hear a<br>bit about well-being in the end of the<br>day it's a question of balance if you<br>don't want to end up like me and who<br>would then ask you need to actually<br>think quite carefully about that and<br>know it's difficult now I know a lot of<br>you have to work I worked as a student<br>myself I came from a poor background I<br>had to work all the way to my studies<br>and know it's hard I really do and I am<br>absolutely sympathetic to this but I<br>just would urge you to allow within all<br>of these commitments on your time allow<br>a bit of time for yourself I'd just like<br>to thank you all then for listening and<br>wish you all good luck as you move into<br>party<br>so we've come to our break and I'd like<br>to just say that we'll see you all back<br>in five minutes for the two nine eight<br>lecture so back here at quarter to<br>eleven<br>so I'd like to now introduce Stephanie<br>Carr who now present your lecture on law<br>two nine eight Acura everybody has<br>everybody doing today okay awesome okay<br>so I'm here to talk to you about law two<br>nine eight legal research writing and<br>communication for this year firstly<br>congratulations on making it into part<br>two it's an awesome achievement so well<br>done to each and every one of you I am<br>here in place of the course director<br>Bronwyn Davies who gives her apologies<br>she is teaching another course today but<br>I have responsibility for the research<br>component of the course so I'm instead<br>of here in your little pack you have the<br>booklet for the orientation and if you<br>open it up hey you will see law two nine<br>eight is the very first page after the<br>ad and the contents so we must be the<br>most important course of course so law<br>two nine eight is an exciting course<br>designed to help you with the law school<br>process and thus foreign language called<br>law you'll have already found out how<br>strange some of the legal language<br>sounds to your ear so the objective of<br>this course is to help you decode all of<br>this language by providing you with<br>practical assistance to help you with<br>your legal research in writing not only<br>for your law studies but on into legal<br>practice so when you write your legal<br>essays or opinions this year you will<br>need to know how to analyze what you're<br>asked for how to find relevant<br>information and how to write it all up<br>and this course is going to be the<br>foundation for all of the studies that<br>you will do at law school also your case<br>books do not have everything that you<br>will need for your opinions and essays<br>especially if you want to do well so<br>this course will help you to research<br>and write better so as I said Brahmin<br>Davies is your course director her<br>contact email is on the screen and it<br>will be on your canvas<br>painful or 298 and here is my picture as<br>the legal research coordinator law to<br>nine eight is a ten-point compulsory<br>course you have to complete it to pass<br>your law degree will cover research<br>writing communication and well-being<br>will be integrated throughout the course<br>and it is a year-long course taught and<br>small groups so hopefully you've already<br>enrolled in your workshop classes<br>through the student services online<br>gonna start just by giving you an<br>overview of the course and if you miss<br>this information we'll put the slides up<br>on canvas for you but how the course<br>will work over the semesters you will<br>start with the legal research component<br>of the course for the first four classes<br>that you come to we work on a<br>fortnightly schedule then from class<br>five through to semester two you will go<br>to legal writing classes with a<br>different tutor and the communication<br>elements will be class 11 and 12 some of<br>the logistics you need to get your kid<br>around is that the first four classes<br>are legal research classes held in the<br>Davis law library so when you go down<br>the hill today for the sausage and<br>barbecue you will be standing right<br>outside the Davis so there's no excuse<br>that you can't find us with a big<br>building right in the middle when you<br>get into the Davis you go to the Bell<br>gulley computer laboratories so they are<br>our sponsors of one of the big law firms<br>in town you'll start legal writing from<br>the first fifth class and you will be in<br>a different room and that will be<br>announced on canvas the classes or<br>workshop schedule runs on a fortnightly<br>pattern usually from a Tuesday to a<br>Friday I'll talk more about that in a<br>moment but if you're in class 1 week 1<br>starting next week then figure out if<br>you're in cycle 4 week 1 or 2 and you've<br>just got the starting dates in an<br>overview of all the dates and weeks that<br>are going to be covered on the screen<br>semester 2 information is on canvas and<br>in the course book which I'll talk about<br>in a moment so what you need to work out<br>for next week if you're a week 1<br>or classes 1 3 5 7 &amp; 9 up to 35 so all<br>the odd numbers attend and week 1 all<br>the even numbers attend and week 2 so<br>you need to make sure you come to the<br>correct workshop there are two really<br>important exceptions to the regular<br>schedule that there are class changes<br>for the classes usually held on Friday<br>the 30th March which is Good Friday<br>those classes your workshops will be<br>brought forward to the Monday the 26th<br>of March at your usual time and also for<br>Anzac Day Wednesday the 25th of April<br>there's no classes on that day because<br>it's a public holiday so if you would<br>usually attend a workshop or class on<br>that day your classes are booked forward<br>to Monday the 23rd of April at your<br>regular time so the example is if your<br>class is usually 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday<br>the 25th you come at 9:00 a.m. on Monday<br>the 23rd instead attendance is<br>compulsory so 2 9 8 requires a hundred<br>percent attendance at all of the classes<br>if you miss a class there's an automatic<br>deduction of five marks and that will<br>happen every time you miss a class up to<br>a maximum of 50% again there is more<br>details on the class schedule on canvas<br>and in the course book if there is a<br>problem with you attending you get sick<br>or there's something going on in your<br>life that makes it really difficult and<br>you can't attend your regular enrolled<br>session then go and see one of the<br>course advisors either Martina or Emily<br>and you must have a legitimate reason as<br>you saw the video doctor certificate<br>dentists note or counseling reference so<br>make sure you follow the rules and see a<br>course advisor Brahman and I as the<br>directors cannot grant any changes to<br>your workshop times what do you have to<br>do to get through with your assessment<br>full or 298 for the research side there<br>is two pieces basically two worksheets<br>which you'll get a word document and you<br>have to complete all the little quizzes<br>if you like and then there will be two<br>online quizzes through<br>canvass and we'll give you plenty of<br>warning and plenty of details about<br>those when we get into the classes for<br>legal writing and communication<br>assessment there will be three<br>assignments they're outlined in the<br>course book and on the canvas page so<br>take a look at those but the really good<br>thing there's no exam so you get to go<br>through clear at the end of the year<br>four to nine eight any announcements and<br>information will the core for this<br>course will definitely go through canvas<br>so make sure you've got your unique<br>email turned on or forwarded to your<br>preferred email to get those canvas<br>announcements what I'd recommend is that<br>if you haven't already been in and had a<br>look at the 298 canvas page do that<br>before your classes one of the key<br>things that you should have a look at is<br>there is under files a copy of the<br>course book all of the course<br>information about assignments you can<br>put into your calendar and also a legal<br>resource online which I'll show you in a<br>moment<br>one other aspects you need to be aware<br>of is that from 2014 all students<br>admitted to new programs have to<br>complete the online academic integrity<br>course if you get a course code on<br>canvas similar to that on the board<br>decadent ao1 you need to complete this<br>course I'm assuming most of you if<br>you've been in stage one have completed<br>this but a few are new to University of<br>Auckland you've got to complete the five<br>modules and the associated tests and you<br>have to get all of them and a hundred<br>percent clearance for your answers if<br>you do not complete this semester you<br>will be re-enrolled for next semester<br>and if you fail you'll get a DNC on your<br>transcript and we don't want that okay<br>so make sure you do that if you have to<br>in regards to the legal research<br>component which you'll start next week<br>all of the information is linked on<br>canvas including this little module<br>which you'll see pictured it's something<br>you could do before class to get you<br>prepared and there are optional quizzes<br>where you can self test yourself and<br>your understanding of the material so<br>this would be really good preparation<br>this weekend just in between the Netflix<br>watching and you<br>the socialising log on to canvas go to<br>law 298 look at the legal research<br>online resource which is in the middle<br>sort of tab and click through the class<br>one information just to give yourself an<br>overview as far as the legal research<br>course content the slide just gives you<br>the outline of what the research course<br>will entail and because it's a practical<br>skills course we going to teach you how<br>to use some of the online materials so<br>if the class one will give you an<br>introduction to some basically research<br>tools plus two going to give you a focus<br>for looking at case law using the online<br>legal databases plus three will focus on<br>legislation how you find in a turret and<br>analyze all that type of source and for<br>class four we're going to look at<br>secondary sources and work on your<br>problem methodology solving skills using<br>the iraq methodology so there's a lot of<br>work there's a lot of information to<br>absorb focus on your goal to keep you<br>motivated so be like the young lady and<br>not like the sleeping gentleman you need<br>to pass this class to get through law<br>school so the legal research class is<br>just confined to the first four rounds<br>for semester one as we go through the<br>legal research courses were going to<br>introduce you to the legal research<br>process which was a diagram we've<br>formulated at the Davis Law Library the<br>flow chart shows you each of the<br>research steps that we will be focusing<br>on for law two nine eight it's also in<br>your course book so you don't need to<br>note it all down today so we're going to<br>consider how you analyze and identify<br>your issues how you consult resources<br>what you need to do to update and<br>evaluate and how you apply all of that<br>so there's a big process quite different<br>to some of the other disciplines you've<br>probably been working with why do you<br>have to do a course about legal research<br>well it's all because there's so many<br>different things about working with<br>legal information and just to sort of<br>give you an idea of what they are it's<br>all about the structure the tools that<br>you use the way that your reference is<br>completely different and how it's all<br>organized so we're going to clarify that<br>in the classes for you but if you look<br>at that<br>canvass online module there are some<br>tips in there and information for you as<br>well what I really recommend is if you<br>go to you book and you want to purchase<br>the blue law 298 course book you can do<br>that obviously at your cost but all the<br>pages are them nicely sort of bound<br>together for you there's also a PDF of<br>the course book available on canvas so<br>you can download that and work through<br>that as you look at that there will be<br>exercises for other research classes<br>we're going to do those in the classes<br>so no need for you to rush home and go<br>through and try and do those all before<br>you come to the class so we're doing<br>group practical exercises within<br>research sessions there is a prescribed<br>text it's the New Zealand law style<br>guide and this is the referencing style<br>you will be using for this whole year at<br>Law School<br>it's the required style not only for law<br>school but the whole legal profession so<br>you can purchase these from you book but<br>there are copies available to borrow at<br>the Davis on short loan so for two hours<br>use in the library or just go to that<br>website and you can keep accessing that<br>there's nothing to download it's just a<br>clickable sort of tool you can go<br>through there is a third edition jus<br>potentially this year so I would<br>actually recommend just rely on the<br>online one for now but if you like me<br>and you do like print tools purchase the<br>second edition from the book shop there<br>are two other recommended texts again<br>both of these are available in the Davis<br>for you to borrow Peter spello the New<br>Zealand Law Dictionary you can borrow<br>that from the law library and be able to<br>interpret terms and phrases that might<br>be unfamiliar to you legal research in<br>New Zealand by Mary Rose Russell also<br>gives you a really good introduction to<br>how legal research works and all of the<br>tools that you will need to use again<br>you don't need to purchase them borrow<br>them from the library the libraries and<br>learning services website you've got the<br>address there I'm pretty sure most of<br>you hopefully are aware of this website<br>there's a whole lot of study research<br>and teaching tools in there for your<br>information you can look up the books<br>key information for the sources you<br>might want to use most important<br>I'm sure you already know but this is<br>where you source your exams from so when<br>it gets to the end of the year and you<br>want to look up the creme exam from last<br>year this is the place to go and get<br>there we also have a law subject guide<br>so this is a page that's collated by the<br>law librarian team and they've put all<br>the resources you will need related to<br>particular legal jurisdictions or topics<br>in one place so you can access some<br>quick links at the top and pleading<br>canvas all the law databases are in that<br>sort of right-hand side if you want to<br>look for New Zealand legal resources you<br>can do that under jurisdiction so it's a<br>very good idea to bookmark this page on<br>your computers and devices so that's an<br>easy access point for seeking<br>information this year the Bailiwick<br>early computer lab as I've mentioned is<br>where you will come next week for the<br>first round of your two nine eight<br>research classes so when you get to the<br>Davis turn right once you get in the<br>main door and you'll see room 203<br>picture there it's a very small compact<br>room and I'd recommend bringing<br>something warm to wear it does get a bit<br>chilly just in regards to my other role<br>as the Davis law library manager we have<br>a Facebook page with our mascot<br>barrister bear or berry as we like to<br>call them so you can you know like us or<br>link to that page if you want to see<br>what's going on in the Dave and what<br>Barry's been up to along with all the<br>other Facebook pages that you sign up to<br>in regards to writing and communication<br>bronwen's asked me just to say a few<br>words<br>in regards to those parts which will be<br>after around 5:00<br>so in semester 1 what you start with is<br>introductions and some well being there<br>will be general writing tips essay<br>writing which is crucial for this year<br>because you will have essays to write<br>for your compulsory classes then in<br>semester 2 you will look at case<br>analysis and case notes some of that we<br>will start in the research classes and<br>that is a really important thing to do<br>all the way through the year they will<br>then further progress with iraq and<br>elements analysis legal memos and<br>goshi Asian so quite a full-on program<br>for legal writing communication but<br>really key and crucial for your law<br>studies this year the legal writing<br>teachers as a Mitchell Brahmin as the<br>director but there will be a team of<br>instructors who will be assigned to each<br>class and the contact details for those<br>instructors will be made available on<br>canvas later in the semester I'm sure<br>those instructors and tutors will also<br>give you their contact details when you<br>first go to their sessions so just a<br>quick summary of the things you need to<br>do after class today go and get the blue<br>course book from you book what log on to<br>canvas and look at the PDF version there<br>and also if you can go and have a look<br>at that legal research online course<br>that is linked on canvas as well<br>hey team have a great year I hope it all<br>goes really well good luck enjoy your<br>time remember to take time out and

introduce Claudia<br>hello welcome I feel I must follow<br>everyone else and congratulate you on<br>getting in here and but the hard work<br>doesn't end now as the Dean said and so<br>quick show of hands who came to<br>university because they think it will be<br>a good thing for a career most of you<br>and so I am Clara<br>I am the employer engagement manager<br>here at the law school and so<br>essentially my job is to make sure that<br>you guys know what careers are ok to get<br>into them and then as well as bring<br>industry into the law school to meet you<br>guys and I'm in the handbook page 27 my<br>big smiley face is there for you guys so<br>I have a curiosity test this is where<br>you need to stand up because we want to<br>know what your Khan joints are be a<br>okay Zidane Bachelor of Health Sciences<br>just a few of you too at the back I<br>Bachelor of Science<br>Bachelor of music just a plain ol LLB<br>excellent okay so the next thing we're<br>gonna do is I'm gonna read a three<br>career statements and then I'm gonna ask<br>you which one you identify most with and<br>stand up when I read about so I want to<br>be a lawyer and the LLB program is how I<br>do that<br>I'm thinking about being a lawyer but<br>willing to keep my options open I have<br>absolutely no intention of being a<br>lawyer but I know the LLB degree is a<br>great degree to have so the first one<br>definitely want to be a lawyer<br>straight out I'll be kids that makes a<br>lot of sense I'm thinking about being a<br>lawyer but willing to keep my options<br>and I am absolutely no intention of<br>being a lawyer but I know the LLB degree<br>is a good one to have the honest people<br>my piece of advice around that is keep<br>your options open as you go through the<br>degree there with part of the law degree<br>that you love there will probably be<br>parts that you don't love to put it as<br>nicely as possible but keep your options<br>open as to what you might do when you<br>leave here anything else any other<br>random career yeah oh do you want to<br>share<br>awesome we will try and help you with<br>that okay does anyone want to hazard a<br>guess as what recruiters look for from<br>law student what is expected from you<br>guys anything you guys are law students<br>you're gonna have to open those mouths<br>and give some opinions to sooner rather<br>than later<br>yep communica yeah absolutely I think<br>that goes for any job but a static meter<br>personality will always be good anything<br>else yes<br>hardware yep they expect good great any<br>of you guys yeah definitely<br>anything else yep yeah competency<br>absolutely I would hope you get that<br>depends on what you do but that is<br>definitely part of the legal industry<br>for sure right<br>this is what I'm talking about they<br>expect strong analytical skills out of<br>you guys we will test them trust me<br>those analytical skills will be tested<br>when you are at the law degree in the<br>law degree problem-solving it's a big<br>one written communication verbal<br>communication and a passion for what<br>they do nonetheless passion is important<br>as you go through the law degree once<br>again there will be bits that you like<br>bits but you don't like aligning what<br>you like with what the real world does<br>really helps if you're really into<br>commercial law then a commercial law<br>firm might be where you want to start<br>your career you're really into criminal<br>it might be with the public defense<br>service so aligning yourself and your<br>passions with what they do is really<br>important okay what to do while you're<br>studying they these are just suggestions<br>there is no tick the Box exercise to<br>getting a job I wish there was it would<br>make my life much easier but here are<br>some suggestions maintaining your grades<br>law still holds on to the GPA getting a<br>bad grade is not the end of the world we<br>can definitely work away it with us but<br>you need to maintain your grades you are<br>expected to have good grades leaving<br>here educate yourself in your career now<br>it sounds really obvious but it the<br>responsibility lies solely with you guys<br>luckily for you I'm here so what I do is<br>I bring employers into you guys they are<br>dying to meet you so when I sent you an<br>email you would have got one this<br>morning with all the job stuff in it<br>register attend and get your personal<br>grande out there get involved now the<br>law school has 1012 clubs and societies<br>but there also be lots of clubs and<br>societies into your other faculties that<br>you're part of and also with the central<br>campus life people getting involved<br>showing your passion about something<br>goes so far in your career get some work<br>experience cannot anyone tell me whether<br>it's summer car keys yep<br>the lonk of the world that was a bit<br>mean I'm sorry car chips are for the low<br>industry and they're essentially how you<br>guys get trained up in law so there are<br>summer Clarks chips they usually are<br>available for you guys to apply to in<br>your penultimate year but there are<br>opportunities to write your entire<br>degree where you can be gaining<br>experience low experience is one thing<br>but general experience is just as<br>relevant your part-time job in subway or<br>I don't know McDonald's is still totally<br>relevant it says great things about you<br>you can turn up on time they don't let<br>you not work when you're in McDonald's<br>you work pretty hard for eight hours it<br>says good things about you network<br>network network I can see the fear in<br>your eyes this word just strikes fear<br>into students hearts and I don't know<br>why networking isn't a quest to get<br>something out of someone it isn't you<br>have job I want job give me job that's<br>not penetrating words networking is<br>genuine conversation with people when<br>you have a genuine interaction with<br>people and you share ideas information<br>passions that'll worried again it's<br>really important and the more you do it<br>the better you get out of it becomes<br>easier and easier now between me the<br>clubs and societies we constantly shove<br>industry in your face we're constantly<br>bringing them into the law school<br>do not waste the opportunity go get your<br>face in front of the people who will one<br>day hire you<br>would be my advice I'm sure everyone who<br>has a job a chair that advice okay the<br>one thing I want you guys to walk away<br>with from here is you are probably<br>pretty good at high school I have a<br>feeling most we do pretty well at high<br>school or if you came as a mature<br>student within your career most of you<br>got into part two so you've already<br>beaten some part of the competition to<br>succeed at the little degree you're<br>gonna get big fat nose it's just the<br>name of the game when it comes to<br>recruitment it's not you it's then I<br>like to use a little dating analogy but<br>when you meet the love of your life it's<br>beautiful so I just want to end this by<br>saying you're gonna get nose and it's<br>gonna hurt it really stings<br>I still remember mine I can't even look<br>at the rejection that or it still hurts<br>so much but you are going to get them I<br>almost want to say it's okay that you<br>get nose it's not you it's then but you<br>will get there so as well as me we have<br>cedars and as most of you already been<br>at the University for a while you<br>probably come across them and so there<br>are career development and employability<br>services they're open to Kate Edgar<br>above I'm shaky oils and they have a law<br>Expo on Monday the 12th of March it's<br>well worth going to there'll be<br>employers there they're not looking to<br>hire you you're a little early on at the<br>degree program for them but once again<br>you're networking and but you can go to<br>see those four CDs cover letters<br>workshops interview tips all of that<br>lovely stuff<br>their online portal and they send you<br>lots of emails with who's coming on<br>campus and you should go and so the<br>person that you guys and would go to in<br>CEOs is Shannon ring she is the law<br>representative awesome and that's all<br>for me you can come visit me if you like<br>I live in the Student Center with these<br>guys and it's a busy period coming up<br>for me because of recruitments opening<br>on the 16th of March and but if you want<br>to come after that you're more than<br>welcome<br>so next we have Kiley Ryan from the<br>University Health and counseling and<br>she'll just do a presentation on<br>well-being<br>hello welcome well done you made it<br>through first-year law we got here I<br>once made it through first-year law -<br>and I actually got into second year law<br>and then I decided I never ever wanted<br>to be a lawyer in my life and got<br>poached and Here I am so things to think<br>about this year I know you've probably<br>all seen this stuff last year who wasn't<br>here last year Oakland University anyone<br>come from somewhere else<br>what prison that me but not me okay so<br>we're going to talk a little bit today<br>about mental health<br>welcome to law you're some of our most<br>stressed out students you're in<br>competition with med school it's not a<br>competition okay don't try and outdo med<br>school on that note okay so we're going<br>to talk a little bit about anxiety and<br>depression in particular today and how<br>some of the stuff you would have seen<br>around campus last year we spared you<br>with emails much to your disappointment<br>but how that works for you and your<br>second year so as a reminder what we<br>know is that 104 young people will<br>experience mental illness why they're<br>here once you enroll in university<br>you're five times more likely than the<br>general population if you're over the<br>age of 25 good news if you have an<br>experienced mental illness so far you're<br>less likely than those under 25 to do so<br>okay so there are some Joy's have been<br>older and so what that means we have<br>42,000 students on this campus and<br>10,000 of them will experience mainly<br>depression or anxiety while they're here<br>so it's huge<br>okay why is that I see all the time on<br>the news them going it's because you<br>look at your cell phones too much<br>obviously I'm sorry but it's genetic so<br>next time someone says that particular<br>parent you can show no it's not mom and<br>dad it's your fault okay that's the main<br>cause you have a predisposition to it<br>it's like other health things like<br>diabetes and if it runs through your<br>family you have a predisposition that<br>doesn't necessarily mean that you will<br>experience it but you may at some point<br>there's always those odd ones as well<br>that pop up where there's been no family<br>history okay but it is mainly genetic<br>so what is it that brain with anxiety<br>that blue that in the middle is the<br>amygdala if you have anxiety you are<br>pretty much born with an overactive<br>amygdala<br>okay we need anxiety it saves us and<br>life-and-death situations if someone<br>comes up and grabs you your amygdala is<br>going to pump adrenalin through your<br>system which is going to allow you to<br>get away or survive in that situation<br>okay so that's a good thing however if<br>you have anxiety your brain does that<br>constantly which isn't such a good thing<br>and is exhausting okay so it's a bit<br>like a lifeguard on duty at the beach<br>who doesn't just save the people that<br>are drowning but thinks everyone's<br>drowning and starts pulling them all out<br>of the water okay and coping with that<br>all the time is pretty tough stuff for<br>your brain to do as well as achieving<br>academically okay it's usually in<br>regards to anxiety things so people have<br>anxiety in some situations and not<br>others the main two we see in university<br>is social anxiety so when we stand here<br>go yeah you should join a club and<br>network and connect you're sitting there<br>going I hate people people hate me I'm<br>not connecting with anyone okay and<br>that's your brain just going over time<br>some of you can overcome it for some of<br>you with anxiety it's really hard to<br>overcome that because it literally takes<br>over your brain and stops you from doing<br>that the other one we particularly see<br>and with law students is exam and<br>testing anxiety if we know about it now<br>we can help you with that it's really<br>hard for us to give you skills to cope<br>with that<br>two weeks before exam time if it's at<br>the point when last year of being<br>sitting lore exams where people are<br>vomiting and toilets before exams that's<br>a full-blown panic attack<br>okay that's your body's response to an<br>over kind of saturation of all the<br>chemicals that your brains running<br>through your body okay if we start<br>working on that stuff now we can make a<br>difference in it so it's worth coming to<br>see us at the beginning of the semester<br>instead of just before exams the other<br>one we see a lot of is depression<br>there's a lot of myths around<br>Christian as well it as a clinical<br>illness that is most likely caused by<br>genetics again okay we know there's a<br>hormonal imbalance in the brain if we<br>take a brain scan this is what a not<br>depressed brain looks like versus a<br>depressed brain the reason there are not<br>so many lights on is your brain<br>literally starts shutting down some of<br>its functions so it can cope with what<br>it needs to that means your motivation<br>goes means often your appetite goes or<br>you do the opposite and eat everything<br>in sight that means you probably have<br>issues sleeping or you'll want to sleep<br>all the time you know either isolate<br>yourself and not want to talk to people<br>or you'll go out and talk to everyone in<br>sight okay so it looks different in<br>different people but it is a clinical<br>illness and we can start tuning those<br>lights back on so one of the biggest<br>issues we have around this is if it's<br>your first experience it's really hard<br>to spot if you know you suffer from<br>anxiety and depression law is one of the<br>group degrees it's gonna up your stress<br>levels and make those dips come quicker<br>so our goal is to even out those dips so<br>you don't drop too far okay and if we<br>start doing that now we can get it under<br>control by exam time it's really hard<br>both of these on memory recall that's<br>pretty much one of the first parts of<br>your brain that will shut down when it<br>comes to anxiety and depression which is<br>an issue when you're trying to do an<br>exam okay so that's worth having a think<br>about our worst possible situation okay<br>we don't want people either to just give<br>up on their degree because that's become<br>too overwhelming we don't want people to<br>hurt themselves and we definitely don't<br>want you to be alone if you're having<br>suicidal thoughts and thinking along<br>those lines okay again that earlier we<br>can help you with this the quicker the<br>intervention is so it's better for you<br>to come to us when it's just starting to<br>dip then when it's in full dip but we<br>can work with both the other thing is<br>when you're in that state that's really<br>hard to seek help yourself because like<br>I said the planning part of your brain<br>starts shutting down and the motivation<br>okay you also think you're all alone in<br>this everyone else around you seems to<br>be doing really well and it's just you<br>like I said 10,000 other students<br>we know for sure and probably five times<br>that amount when we look at you're<br>enrolled in university okay so do come<br>and seek help if you notice that friends<br>aren't turning up tutorials or lectures<br>or they're just acting a bit out of<br>sorts or things aren't going so well<br>don't just ignore that and hope they get<br>better that's going on for three weeks<br>or more please suggest er than that they<br>might come up to health and counseling<br>and see us so we can get back on top of<br>it again so some of the things to think<br>about who reach this point last miss<br>okay you are going to reach this point<br>again and again and again in university<br>unfortunately I'm actually okay with<br>that you are about to be lawyers it is<br>one of the highest stress degrees so now<br>is a really good time to learn to deal<br>with that stress and people often say to<br>me why can't we just spread out<br>assignment to make this a bit easier for<br>everyone you're one of 42,000 students<br>okay there's no way we can cater to<br>everyone so you are going to get times<br>where we give you a lot of work and put<br>you under really highly stressful<br>situations I'm okay with you reaching<br>the top but but you have to make the<br>second part of that picture again if you<br>can't pick it back up and go actually I<br>really need to do this tool like 2:00<br>a.m. in the morning or 11:59 when the<br>assignment has to be handed in by then<br>again come and see us don't just drop<br>off the face of the earth okay we can<br>put things in place for you but we need<br>to know about it so prevention wise you<br>would have seen these around campus last<br>year we know these work that<br>internationally researched ways to<br>well-being they particularly work in<br>regards to anxiety and depression and a<br>very effective when that's not an issue<br>and you're highly stressed out okay we<br>didn't make them up they've been proven<br>to work time and time again so the way<br>you do this say you're starting to have<br>a crappy week and you know things are<br>starting to go downhill pick one of<br>those parts of the bubble and add it to<br>your week second week pick another one<br>third week pick another one if life is<br>still crap<br>after three weeks please come and see us<br>in health and counseling okay that's a<br>big red flag for us that there might be<br>something else<br>clinically going on that we need to<br>address okay or perhaps it's just that<br>you've got so much stress not only from<br>University but from personal<br>relationships from working long hours<br>from trying to do placements and<br>clerkships<br>to the rest of it that we need to work<br>with you around finding some balance and<br>that as we said this is always an<br>important one at the beginning of the<br>semester and it's really hard if you<br>suffer from social anxiety as well okay<br>so some things to think about um you<br>might sit next to other people and they<br>don't talk to you or they seem quite<br>snobby or standoffish or they don't want<br>to join your study group<br>although the one sitting by themselves<br>and tutorials if you're the person who<br>likes to go up and say hello to people<br>and you're all good with that<br>please make the first move okay because<br>it's really hard for some people to just<br>take that step and by you going and<br>saying hey how's it going I'm so-and-so<br>actually allows that to happen the other<br>thing is if you see people around campus<br>not doing so well please just ask them<br>if they're okay if there's anything you<br>can do okay we won't have time today but<br>we plan to actors around campus last<br>year in various states to de-stress to<br>see whether people would intervene took<br>four hours for someone to chicken with<br>this person and see that they were doing<br>okay okay and the other two scenarios no<br>one cheek done to see if they are doing<br>okay so we really have to start stepping<br>up and letting people know that there's<br>help available so where do you find us<br>you know where health and counseling is<br>by now that would be a no so we're above<br>Munchie ma it run no emotion that is so<br>we're directly above Munchie matt you<br>just go on to the what main auckland<br>website I'm going to try and type fast<br>and it's going to custard don't try to<br>find health and counseling from here<br>because this website is impossible to<br>find anything on as you probably know so<br>just put in health and counseling which<br>I'm just not excelling at I even went to<br>school in there was typing we're not<br>even first but we're getting over there<br>slowly we're second on the list you can<br>enroll for counseling services here you<br>don't even have to talk to anyone we get<br>most referrals at 2:00 a.m. in the<br>morning okay in there triage three times<br>a day the general waitlist is about two<br>to three days but we also hold about<br>five appointments a day of people need<br>to be seen on that day okay so they are<br>always available as well we have 20<br>registered psychologists everything is<br>fully confidential your faculty can<br>access that your future employers can't<br>access it the only time it's been<br>accessed is via court records and a<br>murder case so don't murder anyone<br>there's law students<br>and then we'll be fine okay it's fully<br>confidential from there the other thing<br>to consider particularly if you know<br>anxiety and depression is an issue are<br>the welding groups these run right<br>throughout the semester things I ''tis<br>an issue I'm Luke runs a group for that<br>which is skills based surround learning<br>to turn that amygdala off quicker okay<br>so you don't get to that panic attack<br>stage mindfulness we're seeing that<br>great steps in this around academic<br>performance for people and also<br>particularly works around emotional<br>control so for anxiety but also have<br>memories not so great for you this<br>actually grows the part of the brain<br>that deals with memory recall<br>so with giving a go that's what makes me<br>laugh a little bit because I'm pretty<br>sure if you've got social anxiety you<br>don't really want to join a group but<br>there's such a confidence group and<br>again it's just people experiencing<br>similar things to you so if you're<br>freaking out about the networking thing<br>this group will give you some of the<br>skills to do that with not only your<br>peers but with future employers as well<br>mood management if you know depressions<br>an issue this aim is to get those highs<br>and lows less dramatic and keep you in<br>that balance if you think about eating<br>and what you're putting in your mouth<br>24/7 and are on a diet and binge eating<br>cycle we have the top New Zealand<br>specialists in this era and our team and<br>she runs the intuitive eating group as<br>well none of your doctors yet if you<br>lose a parent<br>this is support group rainbow men's<br>group I'm really popular so I would<br>register sooner rather than later same<br>with the MD woman's support group this<br>year we've added a well-being group<br>which I'll be running it's a drop in<br>group you don't have to register for it<br>but again if you know you're having a<br>crap week<br>and you want to look at adding some of<br>those things in but you prefer having a<br>person in front of you helping you with<br>that instead of reading it to off the<br>internet call onto the drop and group<br>which is on 12 to 1 every Monday one<br>semester starts ok and that's and the<br>meeting room opposite the main health<br>and counseling doors I'm so I hope<br>that's helpful<br>good luck try not to get do drift out<br>but when you do remember that the stuff<br>is here guys you in particular are<br>really bad at getting help<br>paid like I said it's a clinical illness<br>your brain is literally shutting down<br>hardening up and working on your<br>resiliency is not going to work okay<br>please come and see us and seek help<br>you've also got your student support<br>advisors and the law school who can help<br>as well other than that I will see you<br>at some point no doubt otherwise have a<br>so I'd like to now introduce had a<br>workbook who will be speaking on equity<br>and well-being as well as Julia Tommy<br>yes hi Kiana Tartu I am actually<br>speaking just on equity and Julia Tommy<br>will speak on well-being and witted and<br>that Aldo welcome to part 2<br>congratulations on getting in well done<br>and we look forward to working with you<br>so my possession that that's relevant<br>for today I'm also a party lecturer at<br>some stage but my the reason I'm here<br>today is that I am the law schools<br>associate dean equity and I'm here to<br>assure you that the University and the<br>law school is committed to equity and<br>committed to working on equity and so<br>that's why we have a number of people<br>and whose job it is to work towards<br>improving our practices in that area so<br>you might then ask yourself what is<br>equity well what is it that I'm working<br>on and and introducing to you the<br>university website for third Ayers<br>equity SPNs injustice that's pretty well<br>encompassing more specific mission is to<br>make this university and in my case this<br>law school a safe inclusive and<br>supportive law school for all and not<br>just for the members of the mainstream<br>for whom systems tend to be designed as<br>if they represented the entire world<br>right so a safe inclusive and supportive<br>law school for all so that means an<br>obvious sort of negative thing and a<br>much bigger and more difficult to<br>describe positive thing the negative<br>essence of what we don't want is<br>obviously discrimination is not okay<br>obviously hate speech is not okay<br>whether you're a student or a staff<br>member that<br>that is the University one tolerated and<br>the law school certainly won't and<br>because if anyone is to be concerned<br>about Vienna's and just as it should<br>surely be the law school so that's what<br>we don't do what we do you want to do is<br>ensure that all different backgrounds<br>and needs and all people's different<br>worlds are accommodated within the<br>school so to ensure that the same<br>opportunities for all isn't just a<br>theory but is a substantive reality for<br>all for people from all different<br>backgrounds with different needs and<br>different realities okay so that's the<br>objective and I guess I'm sounding very<br>serious about that but I think it's a<br>good thing right hopefully in together<br>to work form and so the main groups that<br>I identified by the University as equity<br>groups - as groups whose backgrounds and<br>realities and worlds haven't<br>traditionally been accommodated terribly<br>well by mainstream institutions Pacifica<br>people start as students in this case<br>work on concerned with students Pacifica<br>and sorry I should have started with the<br>one group that has a special status not<br>just as an equity group but Mario<br>viously in OT Aurora New Zealand our<br>treaty partner so and despite their to<br>have the world has not really been<br>accommodated generally and terribly well<br>in our mainstream institutions so that's<br>a much bigger thing than just equity but<br>it belongs to that as well and so that's<br>the first one to mention the in Pacifica<br>students and most recently added people<br>worth from a refugee background<br>and from lo the lower socioeconomic<br>background and I says last but not least<br>the university officially actually lists<br>men or women where there are barriers to<br>access and success<br>I guess the reality is that the people<br>who change is the need better to be<br>taken into account women particularly I<br>guess Kira's which could be men or women<br>was there any rejection on alright so<br>what do we went from you and from all of<br>you we would like you to join us in that<br>mission and in that and vision for the<br>law school so don't assume that dear<br>world is everyone's world and be aware<br>of other possibilities and be aware of<br>any privileges that you may have and<br>keep an eye out for others that don't<br>share those privileges and PB air to<br>support them that's what we went from<br>all of you and from those of you who may<br>be members of these equity groups or<br>indeed not a member of an equity group<br>but also somebody whose needs and<br>backgrounds and properly being<br>accommodated we would like you to do<br>your number of things make the most of<br>the support that's available and for<br>some of these equity groups there are<br>special programs and and so I haven't<br>yet mentioned actually targeted<br>admission so one of the way that we<br>accommodate different backgrounds and<br>needs is to to recognize that some<br>people haven't had the same sort of<br>opportunities in life as as others and<br>while the standard of merit of passing a<br>course the standard of getting a law<br>degree is exactly the same for everyone<br>for entry we accommodate the fact that<br>some people have not had the same<br>support and and opportunities so far so<br>that is really important to the law<br>school in the north<br>is committed to that and that's why<br>there are special support programs for<br>the large targeted admissions programs<br>unfortunately nothing formal yet for<br>refugee background and socio-economic<br>lower socioeconomic but we're working on<br>that and disability as well and no sort<br>of form a group program for those and<br>but for my group programs with Pacifica<br>and the Maori program um so that's part<br>of the support available beyond there<br>and there are student advisors available<br>that specialize in the different groups<br>I and importantly you lose your peers<br>for support though in the main the<br>larger equity groups have student groups<br>that where you get peer support to make<br>it through your school<br>and so before I say a little bit more<br>about two other things that we'd like<br>you to do if you need support and I'd<br>like to introduce and there are four<br>main student groups and hopefully we<br>have representatives of them here they<br>represent the largest groups so firstly<br>the Maori students and terrico cheering<br>so their treaty partner and equity group<br>and terrico today we've got a toccata<br>Kirikou dixon up on a door going well<br>who denote ero I'm a naughty to ferret<br>or little trash so kilda my name is<br>Dixon and I am the current president for<br>tobacco today the Mahdi lost shirts<br>association tena koutou katoa not Santa<br>hitter hitter Winnie I come from a<br>little place called heaven I mean he<br>putter in the far north so you know you<br>know what they say save the best for<br>last and the worst for first so we did<br>our code today we our primary purpose is<br>to provide a fun safe space for all<br>students but especially for Maori<br>students so we have a we have a common<br>room down in building eight 100 you guys<br>will be attending all of your compulsory<br>tutorials so I'm level for tune lifts<br>these um these<br>is that we've got tables there for study<br>groups we have a fridge there full of<br>milk all the time and we have coffee and<br>all those other sorts of things that<br>keep it going during the day it's also<br>awesome to see some of the people who<br>came to our interviews for the the<br>scheme their their henna just mentioned<br>congratulations to not only you moldy<br>fellows but everybody else you got<br>through and today as well I hope you<br>yourselves and your families are<br>immensely proud of yourselves because<br>it's a mess of achievement so Kyoto hey<br>guys my name is Tara I'm the female<br>co-president for pulse' the Pacific<br>Island Law Students Association and this<br>is my sports officer Eddie first of all<br>congratulations you guys are making the<br>cut of three hundred three hundred and<br>fifty students out of 1,000 that's a<br>huge achievement you guys should be<br>really proud so what pulser is about we<br>provide academic support personal<br>support social and academic support but<br>mainly like career support for Pacific<br>Island law students we know that a lot<br>of our Pacifica law students they have<br>financial hardship at home so they don't<br>have a lot of access to resources and so<br>we're kind of that family network to<br>provide for them but just because we're<br>poor Pacifica doesn't mean that we're<br>not inclusive or open to anyone to come<br>by as well as having social cultural<br>events we've got camp coming up to a<br>cultural day and we've also got pulsar<br>dinner what we are really good at also<br>promoting is our mentoring program in<br>the past we've been in partnership with<br>a law firm Simpson Greeson or in the<br>process of also working with Meredith as<br>well so what that provides is not only<br>mentoring you know for exams and whatnot<br>student mentors but also we work with<br>lawyers who can come in give you guys<br>advice on how to you know prepare for<br>interviews start really thinking<br>seriously about your career as a lawyer<br>you know after you graduate so you'll be<br>looking at internship interview<br>processes and you know the questions<br>that they're wanting to be asking and<br>the people that they'll be looking for<br>so I'm we're just at live<br>was it level four building across from<br>TRT building eight 100 so just feel -<br>feel free to come by and we all open<br>arms thanks everybody my name is John<br>King II I'm co-president of rainbow law<br>unfortunately micro president Alex<br>Cranston couldn't be here today but<br>basically we're here to support anyone<br>who's gender non-conforming<br>non-binary queer rainbow questioning or<br>maybe you just haven't made up your mind<br>that's fine and basically we provide<br>support to any students who are any of<br>those categories also we welcome allies<br>as well so if you're somebody who is<br>passionate about the rainbow community<br>or you have friends or family who have<br>experienced discrimination as a result<br>of their gender or sexual orientation<br>we welcome you as well basically we have<br>events throughout the year I will have a<br>launch event on the 25th of March<br>Chapman trip so if you're interested in<br>finding a little bit more about what we<br>do who we are and the events that will<br>be running this year come along and you<br>know congratulations on getting into law<br>school and just the word of advice that<br>your grades will go down so don't worry<br>you will they will have you used to Vega<br>at a student you know there'll be about<br>one or two of you who'll be that still<br>but yeah just enjoy your time here at<br>law school make use of all the support<br>services we're all pretty friendly<br>people so make sure that you get<br>involved<br>so I thought we had Lauren here from the<br>women's group as well I was told this<br>morning I was speaking so my name is<br>Lauren I'm from the woman in Laurel<br>group we're basically just a place for<br>girls to get support in his law schools<br>pretty tough and sometimes it's nice to<br>have shoulder to lean on it's really a<br>transition and we do some really cool<br>activities with some fundraising events<br>we did a sanitary product drive but we<br>also do like wine and cheese nights and<br>got to plays so we really recommend you<br>come along it's a great way to meet<br>girls and we really like flexible<br>leadership structure so we really want<br>part twos to join and it should become<br>part of our leadership team so this<br>sounds like you come sign up we have a<br>Facebook group as well it's woman in law<br>so feel free to join so as I said these<br>are the student groups that represent<br>the main equity groups obviously we<br>appreciate that other ethnic diversity<br>for example is also an issue and I think<br>you'll be meeting some of the other<br>groups that represent those in as part<br>of the student societies part so we<br>don't want to ignore that by any means<br>so very quickly two more things one is<br>for those people who may need some kind<br>of accommodation be sure to ask and I<br>guess that particularly goes for<br>students with disabilities and students<br>with caring responsibilities you can ask<br>for special conditions for tests for<br>example or different times if you can't<br>make it at night because of your caring<br>responsibilities their kind of thing but<br>we can't do it if you don't ask right<br>and that feeds into my final point which<br>is that you can register as a member of<br>some of what some of these groups and it<br>helps in a number of ways a few<br>registered helps us to push information<br>that year it helps us to be ready to<br>help you when you come because we<br>already know that you<br>and this particular background and it<br>also helps the University and being<br>aware of the numbers that there are and<br>the provision that needs to be made it's<br>particularly important I think for LGBTI<br>and there's currently no dedicated<br>funding for that if we could make a case<br>to actually show that you know this is<br>the proportion of students in their<br>group we'd have a much stronger case and<br>for some dedicated funding and so you<br>can register your your formal university<br>record you can currently shower on that<br>if you have a disability or if you<br>develop a disability which is also<br>possible because for example in mental<br>illness cans and work in progress but<br>hopefully soon to be active LGBTI<br>students can be just as such and<br>obviously that's confidential<br>information that's not going to be<br>available to every lecture little on<br>student but it serves all sorts of<br>purposes I just mentioned and finally<br>really importantly if you are a care if<br>you have caring responsibilities of<br>disappeared you can register now this is<br>a brand new system at the law school you<br>can register with sue if it's children<br>there you are see on in the Student<br>Center I if it's children please bring<br>your children's birth certificate if<br>it'll be possible if you're caring for<br>other family members and so you will<br>find other ways of getting their<br>official and then we know that years<br>somebody who may need test accommodation<br>or who may be able to not attend a<br>tutorial without a medical certificate<br>because you tie the sick for example<br>rights are things like that<br>help us to help you and register please<br>I and have a great year thank you<br>hi again I'm here this time with my<br>well-being coordinator hey horns myself<br>and dr. an AHA just agenda report in<br>well-being surveys done at the law<br>school and what these reveal is that the<br>law school can be an incredibly<br>stressful and lonely place for a lot of<br>people so I just want to give you some<br>key messages about that today the first<br>is that you're not alone don't keep it<br>to yourself<br>reach out there's a list of people to<br>contact depending on what kinds of<br>concerns you're grappling with they<br>could be academic financial careers<br>well-being issues such as stress or<br>depression or personal issues that are<br>traumatic that are making it difficult<br>to cope or equity concerns and you can<br>see that list on the front page of every<br>case book for every course if it's<br>really hard to reach out the person on<br>the list reach out to someone you have a<br>relationship with and the academic or<br>professional staff or even the student<br>body and they can facilitate that<br>engagement is absolutely no shame<br>attached the profession needs real<br>people and it needs sensitive people so<br>it's great that you're there the second<br>is I think one of the things that really<br>I found quite painful actually about<br>putting together the gender report was<br>the realization that we took this<br>incredibly brilliant and talented bunch<br>of young people which you are you<br>wouldn't be here if you weren't and we<br>make most of them feel stressed in and<br>edwart because they're not getting a<br>grades and they don't see themselves<br>getting offers from a large law firm and<br>I really just want to carry this message<br>that grades and a job with one of the<br>lot large law firms if there is our<br>vision of success that's an impoverished<br>vision<br>it may be heaven for some people Sydney<br>wasn't for me I got into a large law<br>firm and I spent my whole time thinking<br>my<br>I spent five years getting a law degree<br>and I prefer waitressing so allow<br>yourself a journey of discovery around<br>who you are and what you stand for and<br>what success means for you<br>one of my really cool experiences in<br>2016 teach a woman in the law was<br>inviting a couple of women and to speak<br>to my woman in the Noor group<br>Sandra alofi Vienna Levine Kim they came<br>in and talked about their journey Sandra<br>now gives a talk we've got a little<br>video of her on our Facebook page giving<br>a talk about her experience as a<br>practitioner they struggled to find<br>employment when they got out of law<br>school and they got really creative they<br>managed to scrape into jobs and they<br>lost those jobs because their employers<br>were retiring or going overseas and so<br>they decided to set up their own firm<br>which was pretty difficult as they were<br>young and had no money and no capital<br>but luckily one of their employers<br>provided them with a capital and<br>security to get started he's a pretty<br>extraordinary man his name he's now<br>judged Phillip recordin and this was<br>their mission and their law firm was to<br>run it according to particular Moldy and<br>also to employ other young MALDI and<br>Pacifica woman graduates give them a<br>couple of years experience so they could<br>start their own food and they were<br>joined by item a law see who's now a<br>district court judge and many many firms<br>have sprung up from their little firm<br>they wanted it all they wanted a<br>professional success in motherhood they<br>felt they had law degrees they deserve<br>the whole shebang so they started up a<br>crash in their own law firm now they are<br>woman that I really admire and respect<br>and their journey is one of great<br>success for me and Sandra was saying if<br>failure was not an option<br>what would you do to dream of so I think<br>it just comes down to thinking about<br>what success means for you what do you<br>stand for who are you what are your<br>values what contribution do you want to<br>make and not get stuck on this idea that<br>it's all about getting the best grades<br>we have a little project called humans<br>at the Law School which is about trying<br>to break down barriers<br>telling different stories of hugely<br>successful people who had failure at<br>many points along their journey of<br>success and introduced different people<br>as human beings and give you a little<br>bit of insight into them what makes them<br>interesting what their passion and<br>vision may be so you can see videos on<br>our web page and you can see images and<br>little blurbs of people around at all<br>school with these stories if you have a<br>story to tell<br>contact Tessa Sullivant because she's<br>putting together humans at the law<br>school series we have lots of well-being<br>initiatives including a fantastic group<br>of students who are champions for<br>wellbeing at the student well-being<br>group at the Law School whom you'll hear<br>from a little bit and I'm sure you're<br>welcome to join and they have mentoring<br>programs and organize different events<br>in study groups for students thank you<br>very much<br>so now I'd like to introduce Ella from a<br>uol is to introduce your student<br>societies hi everyone<br>it's all a huge welcome up here as our<br>line for law camp last year so you're<br>about to do it now um yeah welcome to<br>law school it's incredible that you're<br>all here today you're gonna have the<br>next four or five or maybe six years of<br>your life are about to be the best ever<br>so yeah thank you so much for coming<br>along today and a huge congratulations<br>on getting in as nicely before it was a<br>huge achievement and I remember first<br>year as being quite useful and I love<br>servicetrace stops here it doesn't quite<br>there's always a bit of stress that<br>comes with studying law that are the fun<br>begins it really really does so yeah AOL<br>Isis is the Auckland University Law<br>student Society so our job is to look<br>after you<br>we put on lots of fun of you so that you<br>enjoy law school we try and help you<br>achieve the

and I just want to echo what ad<br>Julie I said before grades also grades<br>aren't important because I've got the<br>room that they definitely don't define<br>you okay and you're gonna go on to how<br>amazing careers and the piece of advice<br>that I have is that you will it's a law<br>school with a degree many time you will<br>many times I've sort of been at the<br>library and I've got up and I'm like<br>that's a new deck but I always have and<br>you will too and the most important<br>thing aside from that degree that you<br>will live with as your friends and the<br>people that you've met so get involved<br>do everything take<br>the opportunity to meet as many people<br>as you can and it really just puts you<br>self-discovery in these four years and<br>find out what it is that you're<br>passionate about and what you want to do<br>and yeah I think you'll have the best<br>type of law school possible so thank you<br>very much I'm also I just want to say<br>our office is located in the Student<br>Center which you've probably all been to<br>as you know it's over the road from all<br>the lecture theaters where straight as<br>you walk in the door and we have lots of<br>techy photos that we like and so we have<br>an open door policy so come down<br>whenever you want and also our executive<br>is on the au Lacs Facebook page so make<br>sure you join the group on Facebook and<br>make sure you join the pack tool or 2018<br>page because that's our main way of<br>communicating with you after this here<br>down to law school it's always a bit of<br>a sprint and be careful because there is<br>road and hazard we nearly got knocked<br>out on the way up Johnson and and to add<br>to that hazard is actually a bit of like<br>construction happening at the moment so<br>be creative so I enjoy a job and yeah<br>line that make sure you get your<br>membership make sure you get your camp<br>tickets and there's lots of cool merch<br>available and you can look and talk to<br>the other student societies as well and<br>one more thing we do not check if bus<br>it's unavailable at the moment so<br>there's that ATM app on I think eight<br>you give these a and zebra

the equity officer I<br>kind of work very closely with Hannah<br>Wahlberg my main role as a student<br>equity officer is to be kind of just<br>another support person a lot of the time<br>you don't know who to go to you don't<br>know what to talk about you don't know<br>who's in charge of what essentially what<br>I am is the middle person I can either<br>direct you in the right way<br>advocate for you I work a lot with AOL<br>Isis and all the other groups to make<br>sure everyone's interests are kind of<br>well represented and well thought-out<br>one of my main will with the equity<br>officer because it's so fluid the role I<br>can really kind of concentrate on what I<br>really want to do is for my main<br>concentrations for this year<br>representation so minority<br>representation for any obvious reason<br>and also well-being because at the end<br>of the day like everyone else has said<br>great is not important well they are<br>important but they're not as important<br>as your own health everyone's gonna go<br>through a stage where you kind of sit in<br>the day of until 9:00 p.m.<br>stressed out and crying and then you're<br>gonna say to yourself this is not worth<br>it and still come the next day to law<br>school and do it all again so I'm kind<br>of just another support person to talk<br>to to say that if you have any problems<br>I don't know who to talk to I need an<br>extension I've got this happening in my<br>life I've got that happening in my life<br>I don't know who to talk to I don't know<br>what to do then come see me and

morning a lion wakes up it<br>knows it must run faster than the<br>slowest gazelle or starve it doesn't<br>matter whether you're a lion or a<br>gazelle when the Sun comes up you better<br>be running I'm Nadia Ilene Al SRC the<br>Auckland law school running club or a<br>casual Club that caters to all fitness<br>levels we're a casual Club caters to all<br>fitness levels and we have twice weekly<br>runs after lectures around Auckland City<br>for more details check out our Facebook<br>page and we'll be down at law school<br>after this so come say hi sup guys so my<br>name is Santosh and this is Mohammad and<br>we are from the law Association for<br>international students and we are<br>basically a law association for<br>international students we do both social<br>and academic events and so if you so if<br>you're like paying 40 grand a year in<br>tuition fees you should come hang out<br>hi everyone I'm tarika from not your<br>average law students or Niles for short<br>obviously there's no such thing as an<br>average law student but as you hear<br>people come to law school from all<br>different walks of life with different<br>experiences and through different paths<br>and so we have people who might have<br>been working in a different career and<br>want to change or people who've been<br>raising a family and still have<br>parenting responsibilities or carrying<br>responsibilities and other people who've<br>just been doing other things with their<br>life before they decide they want to be<br>a lawyer and so Niles is here for those<br>people who have those kind of other life<br>experiences and didn't follow that<br>typical typical pathway of just coming<br>to law school straight from high school<br>we all understand that law schools<br>really stressful and so it helps to know<br>that there's other people here who have<br>similar experiences and understand the<br>kind of pressure of trying to juggle law<br>school with other parts of your life<br>that you can't just put on hold well<br>while you've decided to return to study<br>so Niles is about creating a way to make<br>connections with those other people who<br>understand what it's like if you get<br>togethers during the year and one of the<br>things that we've done and will do again<br>this year is bringing gift speakers who<br>have come to the law from different<br>pathways and so for anyone here who<br>doesn't think they want to just go to a<br>big firm and follow that kind of path<br>into their career and obviously would<br>welcome you to come and learn about<br>other things that you can do with your<br>law degree after a few years of study<br>and so check out our Facebook group and<br>I'm looking forward to meeting you<br>hi I'm Mike I'm from Veritas and very<br>tastes like I create group of Christian<br>law students and we get together because<br>if you're a Christian and you're a law<br>student we have quite a lot in common<br>all right so we meet weekly in the law<br>school and we've got some stellar Bible<br>studies planned and I think if law<br>students they'll be one of your best<br>times in your life to get to<br>understanding the Bible because we get<br>quite good at understanding attics and<br>light of its purpose so you don't have<br>to be a Christian to cover long and<br>that's because the opportunities to<br>openly and honestly discuss matters of<br>faith are really rare and you know we<br>also host bigger events in the past<br>we've hosted talks by prominent lawyers<br>and judges now really Veritas is just an<br>opportunity to take a break from the<br>really highly competitive nature of law<br>school you know make a few friends and<br>sort of explore your faith so if you're<br>interested we'll have a soul a stall<br>setup at law school after this and you<br>can also like our Facebook page so<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
