Transport Planning and Modelling at the University of Sydney Business School, discusses a fair user-pays system on Australian roads that would be acceptable to all stakeholders, could be implemented in stages, and which assumes relatively simple technology similar to electricity user charges.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically

Australian roads but there<br>could pay just as well New Zealand roads<br>because there's a lot of similarities<br>between Australia and New Zealand it's<br>not just a humor and pavlova it's also<br>the set up of the cities it's a very car<br>oriented city Sydney's Auckland T's we<br>have some tall roads we have similar<br>types of ways how we pay for transport<br>so everything that essentially holds for<br>Australian roads you could also<br>translate into New Zealand roads so the<br>overview of the presentation is very<br>briefly what kind of road pricing<br>measures exist around the world and<br>specifically in Australia then I'm going<br>to talk about strategies how could we<br>maybe reform the way we pay and going<br>towards a paper kilometre system and<br>that is by many deemed as a fair system<br>you pay for what you use the<br>introduction of it is not easy how can<br>we go from the current system with<br>registration fees fuel excise tax and<br>maybe some tolls to another system where<br>we pay per kilometer how do you<br>introduce this usually it involves<br>changing the laws changing the way we do<br>things but maybe we can do it in an<br>easier way without having to do all the<br>work all at once by for example putting<br>all kinds of GPS devices in our cars and<br>then introduce it all in one go maybe<br>you can do it in an easy way so I talked<br>about phase 1 to phase 4 how we can use<br>this and do this in a probably much<br>easier transition and finally I'll have<br>some other consideration to to think<br>about so first of all some examples we<br>all know the registration fees it's a<br>fixed fee that we pay for using the<br>roads for some people this is may be a<br>lot of money maybe they drive very<br>little for other people who drive a lot<br>it's a very cheap way to get around you<br>said a fair system most of us know the<br>fuel excise tax also called gas tax in<br>the US<br>you pay additional cents on top of your<br>fuel price sometimes there's a scene as<br>for emissions to reduce emissions in<br>other ways is for the general revenue so<br>the different countries prices in<br>different ways toll roads they exist in<br>many countries but mainly in Sydney I'll<br>show you a picture later where you can<br>see that Sydney is probably the number<br>one in the world with regards to toll<br>roads inside the city and we pay<br>actually a lot of money for them there's<br>cordon charging in Stockholm in<br>Singapore and in London and you pay a<br>certain price for entering the city<br>centre a fixed price intensely to reduce<br>the congestion inside the city centre<br>this works well if only less congestion<br>in your city centre but may not work<br>well in cities where the congestion is<br>much further widespread and there's all<br>kinds of other schemes accessibility<br>pricing you pay actually for having a<br>faster travel time between cities in<br>this case so this is in the u.s. where<br>you have a parallel road which is<br>usually one is congested and the<br>parallel roads they ensure that it is<br>uncongested but a price goes up if it<br>tends to become too busy so you pay<br>always for an uncongested trip towards<br>the other city and by priced by pricing<br>mechanism they can guarantee it is not<br>congested but a price may be quite high<br>if it becomes quite busy for safety<br>there's pay as you drive several<br>insurance companies around the world<br>have introduced this so you pay per<br>kilometer and maybe more if you drive<br>during the nighttime it may also be more<br>if you drive too fast over the speed<br>limit so they sometimes put a GPS device<br>in your car you can get discounts or in<br>your insurance fee specifically the<br>younger drivers if you stay within the<br>speed limits and if you don't drive<br>during the night that has been<br>introduced in several countries what a<br>lot of countries are interested in is a<br>pay per kilometer charge kilometer<br>charging you pay for what you use<br>it was proposed a long time ago in the<br>Netherlands I'm originally from<br>Amsterdam the Netherlands was proposed<br>many years ago but there they want to<br>have a big bang all the cars all the<br>means of cars in the country have to be<br>equipped with a GPS device a quite<br>complex GPS device was expensive it was<br>very difficult to do logistics of in in<br>the end the benefits or the revenues<br>were not out weighing the costs and it<br>was no longer introduced in the<br>government abandoned the idea clothes<br>charging have been introduced in Germany<br>for trucks and recently also in Belgium<br>so there are GPS equipped trucks driving<br>around in both countries and these<br>countries are looking into can we also<br>do something like that for car traffic<br>the unique system that was only in the<br>Netherlands is peak avoidance and this<br>gives money to people you could earn<br>money a couple of euros per day if he<br>avoided driving in a peak period so this<br>was cash that you could earn and save so<br>I had a little piggy bank and it was<br>seen as something for saving and for<br>gaming so people are trying to make the<br>maximum out of it how much could they<br>earn hundreds of euros a year by not<br>travelling during a peak period that it<br>has been introduced in many cities<br>around the country until the money ran<br>out<br>it no longer exists but the idea behind<br>this is quite attractive because you<br>don't need to change any laws to pay<br>people but you may need to make some<br>changes if you're charging fever<br>and of course paying is much more<br>acceptable than charging so can you come<br>up with a system that is sustainable<br>over the long time that looks like this<br>that's more or less what this<br>presentation is about I'm going to skip<br>this slide so there's multiple<br>objectives why we want to do this of<br>course we need sufficient revenue to pay<br>for all our roads but also for public<br>transport but we also may want to<br>improve congestion we want to improve<br>safety we want to have maintenance all<br>of these we want to<br>Rufe emissions as well the top what we<br>want to do is how much actually do in<br>New Zealand very well is hypothecate the<br>revenues to transport which means all<br>the revenues that are being collected<br>have to be invested back into the<br>transport system not just the ropes but<br>also public transport and that's<br>probably a very good idea because it<br>makes it more acceptable if you put in<br>general revenues and can be used for<br>anything that's usually considered a<br>success acceptable regarding the impacts<br>if you want to improve any of these<br>impacts it needs to be some kind of user<br>pays system so the more you use it the<br>more kilometres you drive the more you<br>have to pay otherwise there's no way you<br>can improve these impacts so the idea is<br>how can we still collect enough revenues<br>and maybe hypothecated to transport but<br>also improve the other impacts so reduce<br>emissions reduce congestion so how is it<br>done in Australia and we'll compare it<br>to a few countries around the world and<br>I usually also include the Netherlands<br>because that's what I'm most familiar<br>with and also Australia and also New<br>Zealand in this case so looking at a<br>registration fees in north New South<br>Wales in Australia 2017 a light car and<br>this is all in Australian dollars a<br>light car $272 up to a heavy vehicle<br>five hundred and eleven dollars if you<br>compare this to other countries then<br>Singapore sticks out is very very<br>expensive to drive a car in Singapore<br>but if you compare it to New Zealand New<br>Zealand pays actually very very little<br>it's probably still more than a US but<br>not many more many countries in the<br>Western world that that pay less so New<br>Zealand is at the bottom of this scale<br>now let's go to register two fuel excise<br>tax where does New Zealand fit umbrellas<br>Australia fit this is I'm not sure you<br>can read it but I'll give you<br>indicators on the left-hand side is<br>North America so there is us all the way<br>at the bottom Mexico and Canada very<br>little fuel excise tax on the right hand<br>side there is Europe a lot of fuel<br>excise tax here is Australia quite<br>similar actually to North America and<br>there is New Zealand still at the bottom<br>if you compare it with the whole range<br>so Australia New Zealand do not really<br>text a lot and in Australia usually the<br>motor area motorists associations say<br>ask our drivers already pay enough we<br>don't want to pay more if you compare it<br>with around the world you actually don't<br>pay much at all we pay very little then<br>the tall roads this is a picture of<br>Sydney and the blue are the motorways<br>and these are toll roads so essentially<br>all the major roads are toll roads and<br>they're not just one or two dollars<br>they're actually very expensive<br>so if you have a one-way you pay a lot<br>of dollars and you have to go back again<br>in the evening from work you pay again<br>so these are significant revenues for<br>the solo operators which are mostly<br>private operators and it's a significant<br>cost to people in New South Wales<br>there's new toll roads being built these<br>are being added will be completed in the<br>next coming years making the west<br>connects so the average charges if you<br>put a registration fee to road tolls and<br>the fuel excise tax together are about<br>$1,200 Australian dollars a year it's<br>about hundred dollars a month this<br>excludes parking fees which are<br>collected by the local government if you<br>compare it to other countries a New<br>Zealand pays more in fuel excise tax I<br>showed you the figure but pays lesser<br>registration fees and pays very little<br>in road tolls but the total is more or<br>less the same it's about in Australian<br>dollars of<br>hundred dollars a month so they're quite<br>comparable with that respect UK pays<br>more than Ellen space much more mind you<br>that the income levels for example the<br>Netherlands are much lower than in<br>Australia and the most fear about New<br>Zealand and also the text levels of<br>income in the Netherlands are much<br>higher so the people in the Netherlands<br>pay a lot for Transport but can also<br>probably say they have a better<br>transport system so 1200 dollars a year<br>can be not just pay it in a different<br>way so could we pay maybe produce this<br>class because why would we want to do<br>this well look at how different people<br>in Sydney would pay for the same<br>distance and I'm assuming here all all<br>Drive and everything<br>amount of kilometres this person lives<br>in Sydney West which is usually where<br>the lower-income people live they have<br>probably a cheaper car so the<br>registration fee is a little bit lower<br>because it's a lighter car but they have<br>to use a toll roads and lots of the blue<br>area is quite large then a person living<br>in northern side of Sydney they're<br>usually higher income but they may be<br>able to force a Tesla or another<br>electrical vehicle they pay no fuel<br>excise tax at all but do need to pay a<br>lot of toll because they encounter a lot<br>of toll roads in the area then we have a<br>person living quite far outside a city<br>north also higher income may have a<br>heavy vehicles and more registration<br>fees but don't pay any toll roads tolls<br>because there is no toll roads in the<br>neighbourhood now finally people living<br>in the eastern suburbs the wealthy area<br>and they may have a heavy car some more<br>registration fees but there's not many<br>toll roads so they may save there so in<br>the end everybody pays a different<br>amount but they all use the same amount<br>of road space so should we really be to<br>be a letting them pay different or<br>should we maybe have a more fair system<br>where you pay per kilometer so the<br>current system I would deem is unfair<br>especially to people who drive very<br>little they have to pay<br>fixed registration fees whereas a person<br>who drives a lot of pace exactly the<br>same the fuel excise tax is especially<br>expensive for people who have to drive<br>far but also who cannot afford to have a<br>fuel-efficient engine so all the cars<br>are nest fuel-efficient they may be able<br>to be able to afford electric vehicle<br>and the other one is toll roads some of<br>them are mainly want the ones in Sydney<br>are there because the government does<br>not have enough money to fund them<br>themselves so they ask the private<br>sector for money and they want to make<br>it profit and therefore the funding<br>model is such that these toll roads came<br>came about but if you happen to be<br>living close to these toll roads you pay<br>a lot more than if you happen to live in<br>the area where all the roads were for<br>free so is that a fair system so what I<br>also think is it's also untenable we<br>cannot have any revenues in the future<br>anymore because the whole world is<br>turning into electric vehicles and<br>electric vehicles don't have fuel excise<br>tax and tax and electricity is really<br>really difficult to say you put<br>electricity in your car electricity<br>electricity so there is no alternative I<br>think then a distance based charge also<br>we think that in the future many more<br>people will travel longer distances<br>because electricity is very cheap so you<br>can actually have your autonomous<br>vehicle or non autonomous vehicle drive<br>around for very little money they can<br>pick up other people and maybe drive<br>around empty to pick up another family<br>member or just drive around because you<br>want to avoid paying parking fees<br>because I tricity is very cheap you<br>don't want this kind of situations to<br>happen so we want to charge the vehicles<br>especially the empty ones a certain<br>amount of money we don't want to have<br>too much empty kilometers being made<br>this is an article I found in the New<br>Zealand Herald in 2016 Auckland road<br>tolls will drive be forced to pay 47<br>per kilometer I thought wow that's very<br>there's a big step up and then if you<br>read that the final letters is between<br>three cents and forty cents somewhere in<br>that range but it could be about right<br>but also in New Zealand it is likely to<br>be inevitable so we really should be<br>thinking about how do we do this best so<br>what strategies do we have we have a<br>stick strategy when you hit the donkey<br>and you impose additional congestion<br>charges which is good for the government<br>because you get additional money but not<br>very acceptable by the people by the car<br>drivers you can also give the donkey a<br>stick you provide discounts for example<br>in the Netherlands scheme where we gave<br>money to people for avoiding the peak<br>periods but it leads to a decrease in<br>revenue for the government but it is<br>highly acceptable by the drivers so<br>could we find something in between so<br>proposed model is who need something of<br>a stick and something of a carrot so the<br>proposed strategy is a distance time<br>location based system which we call a<br>fair user pay system so the more you use<br>the more you will pay it offers<br>incentives for saving money by driving<br>less driving off-peak or driving in<br>areas where that is less busy uncle<br>uncle gestured the system is proposed to<br>be initially revenue neutral so the<br>government still gets the same amount of<br>monies which is acceptable but Treasury<br>and it would as well show decreased<br>costs for most people so the majority of<br>the drivers would find this acceptable<br>I'll show you a figure with the evidence<br>then the main question is how can we<br>transition to user base system it has<br>always been the limitation we how do we<br>get there what's the first step we need<br>to make instead of just charging people<br>what you can do is make the voluntary<br>system everybody's happy with voluntary<br>system<br>we provide provide discounts using<br>simple technology and a single<br>technology is important because if the<br>technology becomes too expensive that<br>may outweigh the revenues and the<br>benefits of introducing it once you have<br>this in place and people trust it and<br>get familiar with it then you can<br>further expand the system and that's<br>what the system is that a little<br>proposed also we Stockholm initially<br>when people were thinking about the<br>cordon charts they didn't like it then<br>the government said let's do a trial<br>let's just try it if you like it we keep<br>it if you don't like it we get rid of it<br>they trial dates and the people liked it<br>and they kept it the same in London<br>everybody was very much opposed against<br>longer congestion charging they<br>introduced it and in the end two people<br>in the city were actually happy and want<br>to keep it so when people feel that it<br>is fair feel that it is beneficial then<br>it may be more tempted to keep it so why<br>not just try it<br>volunteer it and see what happens so the<br>system is as followers pay per kilometer<br>and how can the copy gonna do this so<br>it's step one and I have your states<br>because in New South Wales or in<br>Australia the state collects the<br>registration fees here it is national<br>but not not in Australia so we fear is<br>going to replace the registration fee<br>with a distance base fee then in a<br>second step I propose it's an optional<br>step to replace the road tolls within<br>this base fee and a third step also the<br>fuel excise tax which is collected at a<br>national level and in the fourth stage<br>you also introduce in addition distance<br>time and location variations so what do<br>these four steps look like let's let's<br>look at the first one I did some<br>calculations and I put some numbers to<br>it so this is completely voluntary<br>people can voluntary participate in a<br>distance based pricing scheme where that<br>works as follows<br>I have translated the registration fees<br>into a kilometre rate so light vehicle<br>would<br>two cents per kilometer up to three<br>point seven cents for a heavy vehicle<br>and that is based on the average driving<br>of an Australian of thirty thousand<br>seven hundred kilometers and the<br>existing registration fees and this<br>would keep it revenue neutral so if<br>everybody kept driving in the same way<br>and volunteer Treasury would still get<br>the same amount of revenue so how would<br>we collect this we would propose to just<br>do odometer readings just read how many<br>kilometers you've driven which is fairly<br>reliable and not many people worry about<br>electricity meters either and has been<br>tested in Oregon the US and what you pay<br>is how much you have traveled times your<br>kilometer rates if you drive exactly<br>thirty thousand seven hundred kilometers<br>you pay exactly the same amount as you<br>pay registration fees but if you drive<br>less you can get a discount if you drive<br>more you never pay more than a<br>registration fee so it is risk-free to<br>participate so you can only get<br>discounts you cannot pay more if you do<br>not provide your domitor reading so you<br>have to then tell the government every<br>year this is my odometer reading they<br>may have to see it maybe at your annual<br>checkup with your car if you do not<br>provide the evidence you just pay the<br>registration fee you get no discount but<br>if you do provide it you may get a<br>discount so that's what this system is<br>voluntary easy to introduce you don't<br>need any new technology this is the<br>graph with the evidence for the majority<br>of the people would benefit if you look<br>at the left-hand side so these drivers<br>here these drivers drive very little so<br>it's the bottom percentage of the<br>drivers with who to only drive very few<br>kilometers a year whereas there's only a<br>few of them five percent the top five<br>percent who drive a lot they're<br>responsible for a lot of kilometers but<br>if you then look how many people drive<br>less than average so the average is<br>thirty thousand seven hundred kilometers<br>60% of the people drive less than<br>average which means a sixty<br>the people would get money back if it<br>was a distance based charging so<br>potentially sixty percent of the people<br>would participate in this experiment so<br>how would this evolve over time well the<br>total revenues are exactly the same this<br>is the situation where you want to go<br>towards so the area under the curve<br>indicates the amount of revenue<br>collected by the government and have now<br>replaced the number of kilometers driven<br>with a dollar because there's a<br>one-on-one relationship between<br>kilometers and dollar this area<br>underneath is exactly the same as this<br>area if there's a fixed registration fee<br>so it is completely revenue neutral so<br>let's try to introduce it let's see how<br>the transition goes we start here this<br>is the current status quo it's fixed<br>registration fee and now we introduce<br>discounts for driving less so if you<br>drive less kilometers you pay less so if<br>you drive zero kilometers you pay zero<br>if you drive this amount of kilometers<br>you pay this fee so let's suppose only a<br>few people were participating it's<br>likely going to be the people who can<br>benefit the most so these people would<br>pay that amount of money and the green<br>part is the ID and amount of discount<br>they would collect but that means that<br>Treasury the government gets less money<br>so to compensate for that they will have<br>to increase the registration fee over<br>time so if nobody participates the<br>registration fee will not change but if<br>people do like it and participate slowly<br>the registration fee will go up so to<br>compensate for the discount given means<br>the registration fee has to go up to<br>here but because now the registration<br>fee is higher more people would like to<br>participate so now maybe this many<br>people want to participate<br>that means more discount given more<br>that registration fee has to go up and<br>up until you reach a complete fully<br>distance-based scheme if people don't<br>want it nothing will happen<br>so then we stay in this state so if<br>nobody likes it we stay here but if<br>people do like it<br>they will go here by themselves<br>government doesn't do anything they just<br>set the rules and they say we just want<br>to have the same amount of revenue and<br>you tell me if this is going to happen<br>or not so if you think that people act<br>rationally and are willing to save money<br>this is where it could go<br>but then the equity problem comes in in<br>Western Sydney is further away from the<br>city the jobs are in the city centre the<br>people with low income the further away<br>from the jobs so the problem is always<br>that a high income driver from the<br>eastern suburbs near the city is Sydney<br>therefore pay less then the low income<br>drivers that have to come from the<br>western suburbs working in the Sydney<br>CBD so this is not good for the<br>government because it's hard to sell the<br>message they are really charging the low<br>income people harder<br>could we come go around this this is a<br>quite difficult problem to solve<br>one of the ideas I have a board from<br>public transport services in Sydney if<br>you live close to the city centre you<br>pay a lot for your public transport<br>tickets so maybe three or four dollars<br>for just one train stuff but if you want<br>to drive for two hours on the train it's<br>ten dollars so the further away you go<br>the less you pay per kilometer and this<br>is specifically done for the people who<br>live far away from the city to give them<br>at least opportunity to drive further so<br>that means that also the the price<br>difference between high-income and<br>low-income people diminishes somewhat<br>you can also argue that people with a<br>higher income have a heavier vehicle and<br>also a Tesla is a heavy vehicles like<br>2000 kilos<br>so these people would pay more but if<br>you want to avoid pay paying more you<br>can opt for purchasing a lighter car a<br>cheaper and lighter car so in this case<br>I can have that a high income driver<br>pays more in for shorter distance than a<br>low income person driving a longer<br>distance so I think there are ways<br>around the equity problem we just have<br>to be creative practical example for the<br>first 5,000 kilometers you pay 4 cents<br>per kilometer then three and a half and<br>three and then two and a half cents per<br>kilometer for all the kilometres<br>exceeding 50000 just an example and this<br>is on an annual basis you can also do<br>this on a monthly basis you can<br>translate a scheme in such a way as well<br>so the technology you need is only an<br>odometer so no need for technology but<br>some people may find it a hassle to<br>every year show evidence of the monthly<br>or all of the yearly kilometers driven<br>and for those people RS the option to<br>purchase or maybe get one for free by<br>the government whatever policy is in<br>place to have a very simple GPS device<br>this can just store kilometers and those<br>should not be more than a hundred<br>dollars you buy them one time for the<br>rest of for the rest of the years coming<br>should be government approved maybe<br>there's an epic epic car play or the<br>Android auto store there's no privacy<br>issues for GPS devices because these GPS<br>devices are so simple they cannot store<br>spatial temporal data the only store<br>amount of kilometers driven only one<br>number there is no more memory in that<br>GPS device to store one number you can<br>automatically then calculate monthly<br>discount so so these people don't have<br>to show evidence every year every month<br>they can already collect discounts and<br>that provides some kind of saving<br>mechanism people can log into websites<br>see how much they have saved they can<br>also have more game so how do I compare<br>with other people that turned out to be<br>very successful in the Netherlands says<br>the saving and<br>gaming elements again but you don't need<br>to do this this is still optional if you<br>don't want to do it every year<br>phase two optional is replace the row<br>tools with a shadow tool in this case<br>the government pace or partially pays<br>for the row tool so the Gov are driver<br>doesn't even know he's driving on a toll<br>roads all the toll roads are then paid<br>for by the government one by one they're<br>being counted in the government just<br>pays but of course then the government<br>if the government pays then the<br>government wants to again charge it back<br>to the car drivers as a whole network<br>and I did a for the calculation for<br>Sydney it's around 1 billion in revenue<br>in New South Wales of toll roads it's a<br>very high number if you divided by the<br>number of kilometers driven is 1.8 cents<br>per kilometer so now in this case not<br>specific people living around at all<br>over road tolls toll roads have to pay<br>but everybody else is contributing to<br>these roads<br>um phase 3 is replace the fuel excise<br>tax in Australia this is a federal tax<br>and this is not voluntary any more than<br>so if you have phase 3 everybody has to<br>participate so hopefully you phase 1 and<br>phase 2 a lot of people are<br>participating trialing and people see<br>the benefits and are accepting for the<br>registration fees and now when you're at<br>phase 3 then the government has to<br>impose now we go national not everybody<br>has to participate that does not mean<br>that everybody has to put in a GPS<br>device you can still do a lot motor<br>readings so it's still easy transition<br>from the current status quo if you<br>convert the fuel excise tax into this<br>base charge it's about 4 cents per<br>kilometer the heavier and more polluting<br>vehicles are the more that you have to<br>pay so it's vehicle specific see if we<br>then look how we have translated this<br>the $1,200 per year is now translated<br>with registration fee toll roads and<br>fuel excise tax into 9 cents per<br>kilometer so in New Zealand Dollars<br>about tens<br>per kilometer and remember that New<br>Zealand pays more or less the same on<br>annual basis as Australia so this is<br>quite similar to what you would pay them<br>in New Zealand so that's phase three<br>phase four is and this is now where<br>finally we can attack you congestion<br>much more is introduced time-varying<br>allocation fees and if you do not do<br>this you will miss out on most of the<br>congestion busting systems because the<br>best choice that people have to avoid<br>congestion it's really part earlier or<br>later to work there's no choice as route<br>choice but often there's no route<br>alternative or not very attractive and<br>often maybe there's no public transport<br>alternative but many people have the<br>option to depart earlier if you do not<br>have that option where other people will<br>so then you're a faster at work because<br>other people look about the peak periods<br>in your faster so everybody can benefit<br>from that so here this is a voluntary<br>system because this is again a<br>discounting system if you do not<br>participate in the time-varying but just<br>in the national scheme with<br>distance-based you just pay per<br>kilometer the nine cents but if you do<br>participate in the time and location<br>based system you can get discounts for<br>travelling off-peak and discounts for<br>travelling in quite locations voluntary<br>so nobody is forced to put anything in<br>that car if you want to get the discount<br>you need to provide evidence and the<br>evidence is provided again by the<br>optional gps device you put in your car<br>what does that look like this is what<br>you're now have in your car you have an<br>odometer which tells you exactly how<br>many kilometres you drive and if you<br>showed this evidence you pay the nine<br>cents per kilometre but if you choose to<br>invest in maybe the hundred dollar<br>device you get one that gives you two<br>rates a standard kilometre and a<br>discounted kilometre rate or numbers and<br>then you can get a discount for the<br>amount of kilometres you<br>in low cost areas or time so this is<br>off-peak periods as quiet in quiet areas<br>it's very similar to day and night<br>terrors electricity and if you don't<br>show the evidence you've assumed that<br>everything is a standard kilometer so<br>then you go t go here this is again<br>similar to public transport in New South<br>Wales because Papa transport New South<br>Wales is more expensive during the peak<br>periods both morning and evening and<br>also check is different across different<br>parts of the city so the morning peak is<br>defined differently in certain areas of<br>the city sometimes it starts earlier<br>sometimes they start later so it all<br>depends on where does it get busy in the<br>network at what time this is the<br>standard distance basis and no time<br>variations no discount for a quiet area<br>so you pay the same standard kilometer<br>rate across the whole city and in a peak<br>and off-peak period but if you've a<br>time-based system then you pay the high<br>rate in a peak and you pay the low rates<br>in the off-peak and if you have the most<br>sophisticated system is exactly the same<br>GPS device in your car is still very<br>very simple then you paid a high rate in<br>certain areas of the city that are busy<br>he paid a lower rate in other times and<br>elsewhere and all your device is doing<br>in your car is I have so many clothes<br>driven in the dark gray and so many<br>kilometers in the light gray and that's<br>all the device is doing just storing two<br>numbers again it's not tracking where<br>you are<br>it is not storing where you're being it<br>only calculates two numbers so there's<br>no privacy issues so we've gone now from<br>the $1,200 per year to about nine cents<br>and if you have the standard kilometers<br>that need to be higher than nine cents<br>per kilometer and the law being the<br>discounted rate is then less than nine<br>cents per kilometer<br>the exact numbers depend on how many<br>people get discount if no one<br>participates then you have the same<br>revenue so then there's not much<br>difference between the two maybe but if<br>a lot of people participate you'd want<br>to have the same amount of revenue to<br>keep it revenue neutral so if the<br>government gives a lot of discount<br>kilometers it means that the standard<br>kilometer rate will slowly go up again<br>the same way as a registration fee you<br>end up just to keep it revenue neutral<br>and if that happens more people are<br>happy to try to avoid and go in the<br>discounted kilometer and maybe<br>participate so it's exactly the same<br>gaming element in there so the<br>technology if you want to participate<br>where you cannot go again outside the<br>GPS device but this again is a very<br>simple GPS device it can only store two<br>rates of kilometers standard and<br>discounted it can be an integrated<br>system and exactly the same things as<br>before and you have again the saving<br>elements and the gaming elements you can<br>check online how well you've done and<br>how much you have been driven been<br>driving in all the months so some other<br>considerations I've not talked about<br>paying more I've only talked about<br>paying differently which is a very<br>different message which makes it much<br>more acceptable for people it sounds<br>much fairer if you say if you drive<br>little you pay very very little if you<br>drive more you pay more the advantages<br>is that it offers genuine possibilities<br>to avoid paying the money so you can<br>change by driving this you can change to<br>try to drive at a different period and<br>save money now currently there's no way<br>you can save that by changing your<br>departure time or driving much less only<br>if you excise tax but not a registration<br>fees the transition is always much<br>easier because it's a voluntary<br>participation system you can start at<br>any time you want you can start small so<br>start me with the trial of a few hundred<br>people or a few thousand why not give it<br>a go<br>and see how that would work other ones<br>hypothecation I mentioned it in the<br>beginning if you want to get some<br>credibility all the revenues you collect<br>you preferably want to save and allocate<br>to spending in transport so Road<br>Transport wrote infrastructure and<br>public transport services which are by<br>the way also good for car drivers<br>because more people take public<br>transport the more empty roads will be<br>this is already in place in New Zealand<br>we don't have this yet in Australia I<br>hope you will get this as well the<br>marketing of this how do we sell this<br>because whenever you talk to the media<br>they will say pricing congestion charge<br>all sound very very negative but what<br>I'm offering here is discounts saving on<br>the money much fairer system the support<br>of motorists associations could be quite<br>important if the government conveys this<br>message people may not believe it or<br>trust it but if a motorist Association<br>is on board they may be able to sell<br>this message much better that's at least<br>what happened in the Netherlands and the<br>motorist Association was on boards and<br>they told their members that it was a<br>good idea and everybody was on board at<br>that time we also get what we pay for so<br>if you want more improvements in the<br>system because this is just still saying<br>at the same amount of revenues you can<br>only spend a dollar long time if you<br>really want to make changes to the<br>transport system and New Zealand he's<br>not paying a lot and Australia is not<br>paying a lot if you want to get more<br>european-style<br>investments then we have to pay more as<br>well so I'm not saying we should not pay<br>more but that's not what the system<br>should be about initially we just want<br>to pay differently but we have to think<br>about what do you want the city to look<br>like in the future and maybe we should<br>try to get more investments here in<br>Australia and in New Zealand maybe as<br>well just a few slides to to finish<br>people will always have opposition to<br>change and there will always be winners<br>or losers so for example picture in<br>Amsterdam<br>the left this was the shopping streets<br>on the left-hand side in early days was<br>quite congested a lot of traffic very<br>unpleasant to walk around and in<br>Australia they would say well we don't<br>have space and make a bicycle lane and<br>the names of them they say well we have<br>very narrow roads because we're historic<br>city but we can still make bicycle lanes<br>we just make it one way and this has<br>been done throughout the city they're<br>making it more car bicycle friendly and<br>less car friendly yester winners are<br>losers but overall this was really<br>supported by a lot of people after it<br>was put in place if you would reverse<br>the argument it would say we have this<br>now and let's go back to this situation<br>a lot of people would oppose it's the<br>same with pricing if you come with a<br>distance based charging scheme currently<br>you propose let's charge the fixed fee<br>for every one a lot of people who would<br>oppose so it's your reference point the<br>same here a nice picture from 1910 the<br>left-hand side another shopping street<br>in Amsterdam only pedestrians there were<br>no cars yet and a trim then progress<br>they got rid of the pedestrian area<br>making it for cars and the trim then<br>more progress they said well we cannot<br>have cars in the city we moved back to<br>pedestrian only and trim there's winners<br>and losers the shops you could argue<br>well there's no parking space in front<br>of our shop so we get less people well<br>where would it be more people here or<br>so finally who will introduce this is<br>based pricing scheme first and my bet is<br>on New Zealand</p></main><footer
