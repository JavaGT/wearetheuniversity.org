to welcome you all here along<br>with our distinguished guests from<br>tonight who are I would say major<br>figures in the struggle against<br>corruption here in this jurisdiction we<br>have first Julie Reed who is the<br>director of the series frauds office and<br>before in a prior incarnation at ASIC<br>she was responsible for the<br>investigation and litigation against the<br>Australian Wheat Board that paid bribes<br>to saddam hussein over the oil-for-food<br>program which is I think an interesting<br>tidbit Marty here Marty Robinson is a<br>AML lawyer which is anti money<br>laundering lawyer as well as a criminal<br>lawyer and author of yes a recently<br>released book from LexisNexis entitled<br>the anti-money laundering regime a<br>practical guide just month ago July<br>ok so quite recent and quite relevant as<br>Marty will explain there have been a<br>number of changes recently to new<br>zealand legislation on this on this<br>point my name is Tim keener by the way<br>I'm an associate professor here<br>specializing in law of democracy issues<br>and it's my job to introduce tonight's<br>event with some reflections on why it's<br>important in terms of arriving at the<br>first reason why it's important I should<br>tell you something that you probably<br>already know which is that New Zealand<br>has an excellent reputation when it<br>comes to anti-corruption in the 2016<br>transparency international index New<br>Zealand was tied for number one<br>along with Denmark if I'm not mistaken<br>but you'll be glad to know in 2017 New<br>Zealand pulled ahead to first place<br>edging Denmark Denmark am i right edging<br>Denmark out by one point but still signa<br>and beyond that significantly ahead of<br>other Scandinavian countries and<br>Switzerland - so Norway Finland<br>Switzerland are looking enviously<br>towards news<br>and now this is not obviously this<br>Corruption Perceptions Index when<br>transparency international is not a<br>perfect measurement by any stretch of<br>the imagination but the countries that<br>are at the top of this measurement are<br>at the top of most other measurements as<br>well and the countries that are at the<br>bottom of this tool are also at the<br>bottom of most other indices so it does<br>give you a ballpark view of what we know<br>about corruption which again is an<br>imperfect universe so that brings me to<br>the first reason why I think tonight's<br>event is interesting as we can learn<br>something about what country number one<br>and anti-corruption is doing right we<br>can explore what New Zealand is doing<br>and its regulatory environment to<br>address corruption and that is a<br>significant case internationally because<br>of its standing at the top now having<br>said that New Zealand score on this<br>index is an 89 out of a possible 100 so<br>to be at the top you only need to get a<br>B+ no country is presently receiving<br>even an a-minus furthermore just last<br>week transparency international put out<br>a press release stating that New Zealand<br>needs to increase its efforts to fight<br>foreign bribery citing a lack of<br>improvement since 2015<br>when similar concerns were voiced before<br>additionally a 2017 review of New<br>Zealand pursuant to the United Nations<br>Convention Against Corruption pointed<br>out key weaknesses in terms of bribery<br>being defined too narrowly facilitation<br>payments being allowed and insufficient<br>provisions in the laws addressing<br>trading and influence illicit enrichment<br>and embezzlement<br>so concern coming from Vienna and the<br>United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime<br>and the countries that were reviewing<br>New Zealand as part of the the review<br>mechanism there so the second reason<br>that I think tonight's event is<br>important is that we might also be<br>poised to learn something about what New<br>Zealand could do better and to not be<br>complacent in sort of resting on your<br>laurels here and in this country the<br>third reason that I think tonight's<br>event is important is the broadest one<br>of all and it's well conveyed actually<br>by the situation affecting my home<br>country under<br>the presidency of jonald Donald J Trump<br>see I can't even say his name it's for<br>an anti-corruption person it's it's just<br>like chewing on some unsavory morsel<br>that you need to spit out so what I<br>think Trump's case illustrates among<br>other things is that pretty<br>well-established democracy arguably in<br>advanced democracy can fail pretty<br>easily without more robust controls for<br>corruption now unfortunately the case of<br>Trump of an illiberal authoritarian<br>populist on the far right isn't an<br>isolated case actually there's similar<br>trajectories as you probably know in<br>Poland in India and Italy and Austria<br>Turkey Hungary so we are at a time in<br>history when people's frustration<br>political scientists tend to be<br>establishing that the election of<br>far-right populist flows in part from<br>reasonable frustration with economic and<br>political systems specifically<br>corruption now the irony there is that<br>voters who are frustrated with<br>corruption are tending to elect<br>governments and candidates who bring<br>only worse forms of corruption to bear<br>on the very system that they've voiced<br>frustration with so in the case of<br>Donald Trump this promise to drain the<br>swamp really seems like in studies<br>flooding it and starting to charge<br>admission so if you may have let me just<br>say a little bit about that is he may<br>have already heard Trump owns many<br>corporations operating around the globe<br>he's richer even when you equalize the<br>money in today's dollars he's richer<br>than all prior US presidents combined<br>despite those things he's failed to<br>release his tax returns or divest<br>himself from his companies and of course<br>he's appointed family members to key<br>posts now shortly after spending 66<br>million dollars of his own money to get<br>elected he proclaimed that the president<br>can't have a conflict of interest and<br>that the law is entirely on his side he<br>then went on to appoint an exclusive<br>group and millionaire of millionaires<br>and billionaires to cabinet positions<br>notably these cabinet positions are<br>responsible for policies in the areas of<br>trade environmental<br>detection Commerce agriculture education<br>and energy in which all of these cabinet<br>positions these individuals have<br>personal financial estates so they<br>apparently like the president are<br>incapable of having a conflict of<br>interest or if they do have a conflict<br>of interest and they're steering u.s.<br>policy towards their own bottom line and<br>their investments and their prior<br>companies that they used to run even if<br>they do have those conflict of conflicts<br>of interest they aren't actionable under<br>the law so anyhow and now we're in the<br>middle of this Paul Manafort thing where<br>it comes out that of course the man who<br>volunteered to head Trump's campaign for<br>free at the time was indebted to the<br>tune of seventeen million dollars to<br>pro-russian oligarchs and quite skilled<br>at laundering money which is perhaps a<br>damning detail in terms of the special<br>counsels investigation into Vladimir<br>Putin's successful attempt to influence<br>the results of the 2016 election so I<br>would say to have an American introduce<br>an event about corruption is perhaps<br>similar to having an Italian introduce<br>an event about Dante's Inferno and it's<br>not that we invented Americans invented<br>corruption or that Italians invented<br>epic poetry<br>it's just that Trump and Dante are<br>leading cases in those respective<br>categories and and I don't bring up<br>Dante's Inferno though that the eighth<br>circle of hell is reserved for the<br>fraudulent and the malicious I don't<br>bring up Dante's Inferno as a suggestion<br>for how punishments for corruption could<br>be upped that would be a bit cruel and<br>unusual but I would know I think it's<br>interesting that the barriers these<br>corrupt politicians who trafficked in<br>public offices languished in lakes of<br>boiling tar in the eighth circle of hell<br>I think it's interesting that the<br>councillors of fraud in that same eighth<br>circle burned inside plumes of flame<br>like spirits Swift and confining fire<br>similarly the falsifiers and the<br>counterfeiters lay about thirsty filthy<br>dark and and screaming afflicted by<br>terrible diseases for they themselves<br>were a disease upon society dante<br>conveys these<br>underlying ideas of what corruption is<br>actually a disease upon society but<br>again those punishments today would<br>violate televisions on cruel and usual<br>punishment the reason that I'm really<br>closing with Dante here is that the<br>inferno is a part of a three-part<br>journey right it's part of a three-part<br>journey towards God not just Dante's<br>journey but an allegory for the soul's<br>journey towards God now why am I saying<br>this to begin to get to the highest<br>reaches of creation Dante begins down<br>below right recognizing condemning and<br>exposing this well the various circles<br>of Hell including those who end up there<br>because of corruption now most of us<br>here today aren't here out of some sort<br>of religious journey to get to God but<br>there is an analogy here which is that<br>we are part of a journey towards some<br>lofty goals of our own which include the<br>integrity of economic and political<br>systems journey towards prosperity and<br>self-governance for all people<br>regardless of class regardless of wealth<br>regardless of political and economic<br>connections and also in today's world of<br>authoritarian populism this is a journey<br>to save democracy and to save capitalism<br>and to see if they can be reformed and<br>survive the 21st century so I do think<br>our guests tonight are part of a very<br>broad issue beyond simply what New<br>Zealand is doing right and what New<br>Zealand yeah could do better I think<br>they're part of a much bigger issue<br>which is the survival of democracy and<br>capitalism and whether those systems can<br>endure so I don't think I'm alone<br>tonight even that conviction and I think<br>that's this is why this context is why<br>we're especially fortunate to have Julie<br>Reed and Marty Robinson these two<br>figures prominent figures in<br>anti-corruption law here with us tonight<br>so Julie and Marty will both have about<br>25 minutes to speak without interruption<br>and then there will be time for comments<br>and questions when they're finished so<br>with that I give you Julie Reeve the<br>chief executive and the director of the<br>Serious Fraud Office<br>well thanks very much Tim for your<br>introduction and thank you for the<br>invitation to speak here this evening<br>I can see some people in the audience<br>who are intimidating me on the left here<br>so some who will know a lot more about<br>New Zealand laws than I do<br>as you can probably tell from my accent<br>I'm Australian and I've been here for<br>the last five years as director and<br>chief executive of the Serious Fraud<br>Office I've got a few slides that I just<br>want to romp through to tell you a bit<br>about what we do for those who may not<br>know too much about us I'll start with<br>those and get onto some of the more<br>substantive stuff so the scope and role<br>of the SFO we were formed under the<br>Serious Fraud Office Act of 1990 and we<br>were modeled on the UK Serious Fraud<br>Office which was established about five<br>years before us I think we detect<br>investigate and prosecute serious or<br>complex fraud we do have both functions<br>which is quite unusual in the common law<br>world but in prosecuting we have a panel<br>of counsel so external counsel who<br>assists us with the prosecution so we do<br>have that independent prosecutorial<br>perspective on things we have some<br>criteria for investigation which I've<br>listed there and they come from section<br>8 of the SFO Act we obviously have<br>internally a much more nuanced set of<br>criteria that fought but they fall under<br>these four headings of scale Public<br>Interest complexity and the nature and<br>consequences and one of those of<br>particular interest tonight is that we<br>see corruption is particularly important<br>to our jurisdiction and we did actually<br>prosecute one person for offering a<br>council planning officer $1,000 in a<br>bread<br>paper bag we lost that prosecution<br>interestingly because the judge found<br>that there were cultural reasons why the<br>defendant thought that that was<br>appropriate and therefore he didn't have<br>the appropriate mens rea oh this is very<br>quickly our organizational structure I'm<br>the director and chief executive chief<br>executive is a public service title<br>director is my title under the<br>legislation I have a general counsel who<br>is speaking at a lecture tomorrow here<br>Paul who's a very good counsel so if<br>you're interested in some slightly more<br>technical perspectives then I'll give<br>you tonight I'd encourage you to come<br>tomorrow if you're if you're able we<br>have three chains evaluation and<br>intelligence business services an<br>investigation and as you can see the<br>vast majority of our resources are<br>operational you'll also see in the<br>bottom part of the screen that we get<br>over 700 complaints a year and of those<br>only about 14 or 16 make it to invent<br>full investigations that's because we<br>get a whole lot of stuff that's just not<br>serious enough we refer them to other<br>agencies they don't constitute fraud at<br>all and we have a number of vexatious<br>complainants who like to write to us on<br>a regular basis just in case we're<br>getting lonely we have a strategic plan<br>which you can find on our website and<br>I'm not going to stay to talk about that<br>although obviously it includes<br>corruption in terms of New Zealand's<br>corruption context as Tim has mentioned<br>already in 2017 New Zealand was number<br>one actually New Zealand has held the<br>number one place either alone or with<br>others on the index 13 times more than<br>any other country and nearest competitor<br>in this regard is Denmark which has been<br>at number one ten times followed by<br>Finland with six so we're actually quite<br>a long way ahead in that respect in just<br>in the sheer number of times that we've<br>been up there we've performed<br>significantly better than our fellow<br>five eyes can't<br>does everyone know what I mean by that<br>yeah sorry it sort of come into common<br>parlance but I'm not absolutely sure<br>so with Canada is the only other five<br>ice country that has ranked within the<br>top five and I've done that five times<br>but the remaining five ice countries of<br>Australia United States in the UK have<br>never ranked in the top five so it's<br>quite you know it's quite a long way<br>ahead in terms of the corruption<br>perception index and of course the<br>interesting corruption is not new the<br>index goes back to about 1995 I think<br>transparency international was formed in<br>1993 and first published their index in<br>1995 long prior to that though the u.s.<br>created their Foreign Corrupt Practices<br>Act that was 1977 it sat there for<br>almost 20 years before anyone did<br>anything with it which is a really<br>interesting thing but obviously some<br>time ago bribes to secure business or to<br>speed up transactions were just seen as<br>a necessary evil of doing business<br>particularly in emerging markets now<br>there's a commercially star-studded list<br>of defendants who've been caught in the<br>net of investigations particularly by<br>the UK and the US and interestingly<br>interest was first sparked in America in<br>corruption and particularly foreign<br>corruption when they started to<br>appreciate the economic interests of US<br>businesses were being damaged by<br>corruption in these developing economies<br>because they have their care companies<br>were being beaten to contracts by people<br>who appeared to pay bribes and so they<br>realized that there was an economic<br>imperative for the u.s. to start<br>enforcing their Foreign Corrupt<br>Practices Act so as I said proximately<br>twenty years after its enactment the<br>FCPA started to be used and at about the<br>same time the OECD convention came into<br>existence of the foreign bribery<br>Convention for short and the uncock<br>convention came into operation in two<br>thousand one of the things that's<br>obvious about the perceptions index and<br>as Tim's already mentioned is that it's<br>just perceptions there's approximately<br>16 indices so it's actually just an<br>index of indices so they don't do<br>original research themselves they take<br>they can aggregate a whole lot of<br>indices and come up with their index<br>there are about 16 separate indices that<br>are used but not every country is ranked<br>by all of those indices New Zealand is<br>rent in approximately 8 and the maximum<br>that any countries ranked under needs 10<br>interestingly also the indices that New<br>Zealand is ranked in the indices rent<br>where the top countries are rent so if<br>you're in that index you've got a better<br>chance of getting up to the top is the<br>basic story so how is all this in this<br>interest in corruption over the last 20<br>odd years affected New Zealand now we've<br>traded on our reputation as a high<br>integrity market for at least since the<br>first TI index was released in 1995 when<br>we were ranked 1 and even if we wanted<br>to back away now from that and I don't<br>think we do the anti-corruption movement<br>has gained so much momentum that an<br>enormous political support that it would<br>be possible as especially unilaterally<br>to walk away from the ti index or indeed<br>the two conventions<br>we've now ratified the two conventions<br>and that's why New Zealand has only just<br>been assessed under unkept because we<br>only ratified that legislation recently<br>New Zealand has a policy of not<br>ratifying conventions<br>although they're signed at the start<br>they don't ratify until we consider our<br>laws compliant so there's a whole lot of<br>other countries who ratify immediately<br>and then become compliant and so while<br>in New Zealand was criticized for quite<br>some time for not having ratified uncock<br>United Nations Convention Against<br>Corruption that was because we felt that<br>we couldn't comply so I don't think that<br>that's actually inappropriate but or a<br>matter for criticism but obviously<br>nonetheless we've signed we believe we<br>comply but the<br>the standards keep getting ratcheted up<br>so every time they have a round of<br>reviews they look at different things<br>and come up with some different<br>standards that everyone's looking for<br>there's no doubt that we are at risk of<br>corruption we are trading in different<br>parts of the world than we used to<br>whereas we were focused on the<br>Commonwealth countries Australia in the<br>UK in particular we trade far more<br>widely in China and other countries<br>which are subject to much greater risk<br>of corruption and the pressure of these<br>assessments and so on has also lead to<br>the decision to implement the second<br>tranche of AML which Marty is going to<br>tell you about because I know nothing<br>and that we'll be interested to hear<br>about that<br>so our corruption risks we think one of<br>the biggest risks to New Zealand is the<br>complacency in addressing corruption<br>I've no doubt that we do experience less<br>corruption here than in many countries<br>of the world<br>however despite some recent<br>strengthening of our laws in relation to<br>corruption and the reality is that we<br>rely on willing compliance so we have a<br>cultural compliance with anti-corruption<br>laws but you know those societal norms<br>are going to be very much diluted by the<br>enormous diversity in immigration that<br>we're getting and we're having many<br>people come in like the man who paid<br>$1,000 in a paper bag to a planning<br>officer who don't understand that that's<br>not acceptable here and they will that<br>will mean that those norms will be<br>diluted and we can't just rely on people<br>to willingly comply we really need to do<br>it's obviously it's obvious that it's<br>really hard to understand the scale and<br>extent of corruption<br>Sealand it's something that's kept<br>hidden it's the same as fraud in that<br>respect and we can only truly know about<br>the cases that have been uncovered and<br>one of the things that we know is that<br>the case is uncovered represent a<br>fraction of what exists but there's<br>really very little agreement about what<br>exists about how that fraction should be<br>expressed is that it do we see a third<br>of the cases do we see a tenth in in the<br>five wise countries it's generally<br>accepted for example that about 5% of<br>the government's budget is lost to fraud<br>and I'll talk a little bit about the<br>overlap between fraud and corruption but<br>that's you know for New Zealand that's<br>maybe two billion dollars a year of the<br>budget it's an extraordinary amount of<br>money and if we can do something to stem<br>the tide that would be fantastic because<br>it would mean that money would get to<br>where it ought to go in trading partners<br>so just very briefly the difference<br>between fraud and corruption not much is<br>my answer to that that's a common law<br>and talk a little bit about our specific<br>legislation later the seat is not<br>required so you don't need to deceive<br>someone in order to defraud them so in<br>Scotland the Metropolitan Transport<br>Trust which is quite a seminal case in<br>relation to fraud the employees of<br>cinema Ronan's agreed with the<br>defendants to temporarily abstract<br>without permission and for cinema<br>Ronan's a whole range of films so you<br>can imagine in those days this is when<br>this is 1974 films are under those big<br>canisters and the employees receive<br>payment for doing that and the people<br>who received them without the knowledge<br>or consent of the owners copied them for<br>their own purposes so that the islands<br>didn't actually know that the films had<br>been taken but they had suffered loss<br>because presumably people were people<br>who may have been there cuz<br>I saw the films that had been pirated in<br>effect by the defendants so the court<br>and he were did tend to be at pains to<br>say that loss had been caused to the<br>cinema owners so we've got obtained<br>again and caused a loss but it's also a<br>potentially a case of economic<br>impairment which have been very much at<br>the heart of two cases that we've run<br>recently emily holdings which i've<br>forgotten the name ross and waited<br>behind were defendants and they've just<br>been sentenced last week to four years<br>each and also a case gang wing who was<br>also called hung Kwong and a number of<br>defendants both of those do all of those<br>defendants obtained mortgage monies from<br>banks by misrepresenting the nature of<br>the risk that the banks were taking on<br>in providing the mortgages so nothing<br>was lost by the banks in either of those<br>cases but there were very significant<br>sums of economic empowerment so and<br>deflecting the public officer from their<br>duties the fourth category of fraud<br>which was recognized in scott corruption<br>on the other hand is abusive entrusted<br>power for private gain and in both the<br>private and public sectors and that's<br>recognized in new zealand that's the<br>transparency international definition<br>and it's the one i prefer because i<br>think that covers all situations there<br>are a lot more technical definitions<br>used by the various development banks<br>and so on but I think this one's<br>actually the most appropriate there's an<br>enormous overlap between those two<br>things so if you have for example john<br>harrison who was at the Ministry of<br>Transport have managed to take<br>approximately seven hundred thousand<br>dollars as a tier 2 public servant she<br>used her position to manipulate the<br>records of the Ministry of Transport in<br>order to benefit herself that Falls<br>clearly within abuse of entrusted power<br>for private gain but we prosecuted her<br>for fraud some<br>the fraud offenses here can be quite<br>difficult to fit things into so we have<br>both avenues and I think that that's<br>appropriate so I managed to shuffle my<br>slides here New Zealand's New Zealand's<br>corruption experience I mentioned Joann<br>Harrison at the bottom Auckland<br>Transport was a division of the Auckland<br>City Council who within that sorry<br>wasn't Auckland Transport as a whole a<br>division of Auckland Transport received<br>enormous benefits from a supplier that<br>included mobile phones like iPhones for<br>all of the staff they were taken out to<br>lunch as they were given overseas trips<br>they weren't paid cash not extensively<br>one of the person at the head of that<br>section did get paid as a as a<br>contractor on a regular basis but he<br>bought there weren't bags brown bags of<br>cash again we charge them with fraud but<br>they were using the their positions to<br>give this contractor money sorry<br>contracts for con transport<br>Wallace Deo who was also an employee of<br>the Waitangi Trust and he used his<br>position to to defraud the trust off I<br>can't remember a significant sum of<br>money he's recently pleaded guilty<br>procurement fraud which is a bit of the<br>Auckland Transport thing<br>misappropriation of assets undisclosed<br>conflicts of interest and inappropriate<br>gives some favor so that the<br>inappropriate give us some favors<br>Auckland Transport one months that they<br>went to cost $15,000 and finished at<br>nine o'clock at night it's a little bit<br>hard to imagine how that was appropriate<br>so a lot of these things in fact most of<br>these things with prosecutors fraud we<br>do prosecute corruption offences but<br>there's an enormous overlap so our<br>legislative responses we've had the<br>organized crime and anti-corruption bill<br>in 2015 which was in part the<br>legislation introduced to allow us to<br>ratify unque<br>narrow the circumstances where<br>facilitation payments were appropriate<br>and increased the penalties for the<br>private sector corruption in the secret<br>Commission's Act which were increased<br>from two two years to seven years<br>imprisonment maximums so I have shuffled<br>these a little bit so the public<br>corruption is in the Crimes Act<br>basically so we have a raft of offences<br>there that include judicial corruption<br>but the fundamental one of bribing a<br>public officer and in the secret<br>Commission's Act we have the equivalent<br>of private sector corruption some of the<br>other responses liability for foreign<br>bribery there I'm referring to<br>corporations so interestingly we have a<br>real divergence between corporate<br>liability for bribery in this country we<br>sort of parachuted in a set of<br>provisions relating to foreign bribery<br>so bribery of a foreign official which<br>included four carious liability for<br>companies so a corporation can be<br>convicted of foreign bribery<br>if an employee acts within the scope of<br>their responsibilities and make pays a<br>bribe so that it's it's not technically<br>it's not named as vicarious liability<br>but that's the effect of it whereas in<br>domestic law in order for a corporation<br>to be responsible for a bribe we still<br>have the directing mind and we'll theory<br>of corporate liability so it's a real<br>it's a real dichotomy between the two<br>and one of the things we think is that<br>that should be addressed the narrowing<br>of the facilitation payments is<br>something that's gotta seem to quite a<br>lot of hot water overseas the OECD in<br>particular don't like so what we did was<br>to create an exception where an act<br>committed for the sole or primary<br>purpose of ensuring or expediting<br>performance by a government official or<br>of routine government action is<br>it very little is actually going to fit<br>in with that you can't pay millions of<br>dollars to someone to do something<br>within the time they're supposed to do<br>it it's it's unlikely and if you do pay<br>that it's not going to be a facilitation<br>payment I'm not I understand that the<br>OECD would like a very purist approach<br>to this but I'm not sure that our<br>position is really inconsistent future<br>consideration a definition of corruption<br>will be good at the present time Erik<br>defines a bribe as money valuable<br>consideration office or employment or<br>any sorry office of employment I think<br>or any benefit it's made an offense to<br>pay the bribe by requiring that the<br>bribe been corruptly given or offered<br>and there's no definition of corruptly<br>so I think it would make the legislation<br>deferred prosecution agreements is<br>something that we're also very<br>interested in the United States has had<br>deferred prosecution agreements probably<br>25 years or more and they'll also have<br>non prosecution agreements and those<br>agreements are reached between the<br>prosecutor and the inflation<br>investigator in the UK's case to settle<br>with a corporation in return for their<br>cooperation which enables the<br>prosecution of individuals so that's<br>something that we would like to look at<br>but of course there's no incentive for a<br>corporation to cooperate I would think<br>if you have the direct in mind and we'll<br>basis of liability because it's going to<br>be very hard to incriminate the<br>corporation anyway but in the UK that's<br>despite them having the direct in mind<br>and world theory of liabilities I've had<br>quite a bit of success in getting<br>cooperation under their deferred<br>prosecution regime and modernizing the<br>offense regime in the Crimes Act my<br>personal preference would be to<br>modernize it so that it represented the<br>four varieties of fraud but at the<br>moment we have a whole menu of different<br>things which don't really effectively<br>cover the field so yes if I use section<br>two<br>hundred-and-twenty which is something<br>that I'm not now going to forget theft<br>by person in a special relationship for<br>a lot of the financial companies that<br>were in trouble after the GFC so we had<br>to shoehorn a whole lot of offenses into<br>that and I think ideally we need to move<br>some way towards ensuring that the<br>offenses are more modern and we'll cover<br>the you know financial transactions that<br>exist today recently had received<br>cabinet approval for the commencement of<br>a work program an anti-corruption work<br>program so this is not investigation and<br>prosecution this is what can we do to<br>ensure that we strengthen our regime and<br>stay ahead it includes development<br>developing a shared understanding of<br>corruption and the specific<br>vulnerabilities in New Zealand local<br>government procurement which we know<br>from our own experience is a is a<br>difficult area international threats and<br>risks public funding allocation so<br>there's a lot of work being done<br>elsewhere looking at public funding and<br>in the UK for example it's each<br>Government Department has to declare and<br>report it to you how much fraud has<br>occurred on their department and if you<br>don't declare anything you can see that<br>not to be doing your job whereas here<br>interestingly when Joe in Harrison's<br>case came to life what we did was to<br>vilify the chief executive who reported<br>it which i think is a really<br>counterproductive thing to do what chief<br>executive would want to report forward<br>having seen that experience about<br>Matthews experience in the UK that's<br>celebrated if you find it because that's<br>good we can stop it we can learn from it<br>and we can change practices but I think<br>it's fair to say that most of the chief<br>executive said to me at that time there<br>but for the grace of God go I because<br>you know Joe and Harrison for example<br>there were you might have seen in the<br>news there were reports about Joey<br>but she she was a highly trusted<br>employee she was considered to be the<br>best performer in the senior leadership<br>team at the Ministry of Transport there<br>are all sorts of reasons why she would<br>be trusted and that's what we're all<br>doing every day we know that that you're<br>a person who would pick up $20 if I<br>dropped it and give it back to me so why<br>wouldn't I trust you with something else<br>or you good at your job so why don't I<br>trust you to do everything in your job<br>well I think it's a very human reaction<br>and it's quite unfortunate that we took<br>that approach and that's something I've<br>talked a little bit about in government<br>as well probably not directly about<br>corruption but still we want to measure<br>the value of prevention efforts we think<br>that that's really important too because<br>it it's there's that two billion dollars<br>there and if we can talk about how much<br>of that we've saved that would be<br>fantastic and some private sector<br>outreach and again modernization at the<br>relevant legislation so that's the end<br>from me thank you very much for<br>listening to the state that I haven't<br>talked about corruption please feel free<br>to ask questions later and I'll just<br>thank you good um it's very interesting<br>I really like their public works program<br>I wasn't weird most of it and my name is<br>marty i am i come from SFO london for<br>about six or seven years doing the sort<br>of work that julie has done but<br>obviously the lower level investigating<br>lawyer lille and i've spent some time at<br>the DIA which is the main regulator in<br>the anti-money laundering space and so<br>we may get to that and i've always been<br>a little bit sort of prosecute or<br>prosecutorial and my thinking i am when<br>i was about for told my mom what do you<br>wanna be Maddie please stop recognizing<br>that wasn't no concepts that you could<br>do I think it's always been in there and<br>I've spent probably more years<br>prosecuting than defending but I like<br>the court litigation work and so that's<br>my background and fell into the AML<br>consultancy that I do now as a lawyer<br>Hemmingway to the AML with the AML team<br>at the DIA in prior to that I was more<br>into the flawed prosecution with the<br>crown solicitor in Christchurch London<br>but I've really enjoyed the AML stuff so<br>I'll give you a bit more about that I'm<br>gonna set my timer for 18 minutes that's<br>what I give my kids at 6 minutes each of<br>stories otherwise good time and if I<br>haven't I haven't by the end got onto<br>the AML it I will so look the biggest<br>problem for Humanity what would you say<br>it was a lot of people would say it's<br>just simply global warming that it's<br>pretty obvious there's various other<br>solutions to that question and but I'm<br>gonna seduce we flip the script for a<br>moment and consider what's preventing<br>humanity from transforming societies<br>from nepotistic autocracies such as the<br>ten-time country into flourishing<br>democracies where citizens feel heard<br>respected and empowered to contribute to<br>a fear egalitarian society such as<br>grapes New Zealand judging by the states<br>would think given the sort of<br>international community that may be<br>promoted if all the countries had that<br>similar sort of approach the<br>Scandinavian model the the newsela model<br>wouldn't we come together better to<br>solve things like global woman when we<br>start to listen and actually tackle the<br>things that need attack with rather than<br>sweeping them under the carpet and<br>Oh<br>with<br>so if money laundering and terrorist<br>financing that have been clinging the<br>mini trace of the original crime which<br>is to say that the head of the audit<br>trail the victims of breaking off<br>escapes did money laundering is<br>described as having three overlapping<br>phases but really just means replacing<br>the<br>so<br>so<br>why<br>to<br>to<br>Oh</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
