Amelia Sherman who is<br>with the interim climate change<br>committee<br>she's on conspire secondment from the<br>Productivity Commission and then I mean<br>John Kenney he will follow Amelia and<br>John as the executive director of<br>business New Zealand energy Council and<br>I should just like to acknowledge the<br>support that the New Zealand Business<br>Energy Council has afforded the Energy<br>Centre to do the modeling work looking<br>at New Zealand's energy futures so<br>that's a very exciting project that we<br>have with thee in New Zealand Energy<br>Council and then the last speaker is<br>Professor Caroline Saunders our who is<br>incredibly well known as a academic and<br>New Zealand Carolinas based at Lincoln<br>University and I understand she's just<br>launched a book on well-being is that<br>right Caroline and she's probably got<br>it's free so there you go the price is<br>right okay so as you know it as I<br>understand it the zero carbon bill is<br>currently being drafted and my<br>understanding as that was to occur or is<br>to occur over July December of this year<br>and it'll go to select committee at the<br>beginning of the new year so with that<br>in mind I just like to ask John to<br>delete off the presentation and we're<br>going to ask each speaker to speak for<br>ten minutes and then at the end after<br>Caroline we'll have a question and<br>tena koutou katoa called John Merrow<br>taco Angora no America Ajo K Ponsonby a<br>no ho-anna ko ko ko' Taronga hey chief<br>sustainability officer to a County Hera<br>Oh Tamaki Makoto aha no raita tena<br>koutou katoa thank you for the<br>opportunity be up here my name is John<br>morrow as you were told and I've got 10<br>minutes to whip you through the clickers<br>they're a quick presentation about three<br>things that's the end that's pretty<br>quick any questions so I I'm clearly I<br>just wanted to UM there we go excellent<br>Hey great look pretty pictures here we<br>go so three quick things one a few<br>basics about the zero carbon bill which<br>we can probably cover off in two slides<br>and I'm guessing this is a relatively<br>informed audience the second thing is<br>just you know of course I'm from Council<br>I want to tell you all the great stuff<br>we're doing but I do have a confession<br>in there too as I've said to a few over<br>wine and then also what we're really up<br>against and how we really need to<br>reposition ourselves to think about the<br>future those are the three things I'll<br>cover and now about eight and a half<br>minutes but let's be really clear how<br>many people besides Russell Bailey came<br>here to see this guy instead of me I'm<br>really sorry and I can't speak on behalf<br>of the Green Party but I can actual<br>say from a counsel who's quite involved<br>with central government and actually<br>working and have a signed agreement with<br>how we're working together on climate<br>change talk a little bit about what<br>we're doing in the space and a little<br>bit about government obviously not from<br>somebody from central government this is<br>what I presented to councillors in the<br>mayor when we tried to get our zero<br>carbon bill submission across the line<br>which was successfully voted for and<br>this I'll show you what our actual<br>position is and the next slide but for<br>those who are coming up to speed on what<br>the zero carbon bill is which I imagine<br>is probably no one you know really what<br>this does is set the policy architecture<br>for the future it's not a quick fix it's<br>actually what can we do now to<br>transition to a low-carbon and resilient<br>society over the course of several<br>decades that's what this is about it<br>provides stability and transparency<br>across all sectors and it actually<br>that's quite a bit to try to generate<br>pathways for innovation so that we don't<br>leave businesses or people behind the<br>specifics as those who are well read in<br>the this is almost painful to see me<br>condense it to just a few words but it<br>sets targets and budgets that align with<br>those targets it creates a new<br>independent commission which I believe<br>my colleague might speak a little bit<br>about and then it considers climate<br>change adaptation as part of the package<br>which is actually later at minute nine<br>one of my takeaway messages from what<br>we're doing these are the six key points<br>we made to committee and they bought it<br>and they endorsed it and that's what we<br>sent off to the to the ministry for the<br>environment I won't go into every detail<br>here but I have a suspicion we might get<br>talking about what it means to set a<br>target of net zero across all gases that<br>could be a feisty one because it's<br>contestable the rest of it isn't<br>terribly contestable but maybe it is<br>from the audience so we'll we can go<br>there now the other thing I wanted to do<br>is just take you very briefly through<br>some of the things we're doing as<br>council but of course I'm gonna end with<br>a bit of a confession and I'm gonna give<br>you five quick examples with an obvious<br>problem that has something to do with<br>climate change and then a bit of value<br>add something that we've done a slight<br>bit differently to get a better outcome<br>the first one is actually in our waste<br>and<br>and to acknowledge the folks and a waste<br>team actually to acknowledge the staff<br>here from welcome council I've seen<br>Sophia hey way think aleck tank my team<br>might be here maybe Sarah Anderson<br>there's some great people at council<br>doing innovative work in the space of<br>waste and actually a lot of other things<br>and instead of saying how do we just get<br>the waste done we actually created<br>community recycling centers that empower<br>the community almost decentralized power<br>to individuals creating jobs and<br>actually diverting something like 62% of<br>waste to landfill at some of these<br>centers so it's a bit of a new way of<br>doing business in the waste space you<br>could look at flooding and<br>infrastructure as an issue and say well<br>let's just put in a bigger pipe when<br>we've got a problem with flooding<br>instead the healthy waters team went in<br>and actually created training for the<br>workforce they're a collaborative tree<br>planting nursery with a school and a<br>local trust and actually added transport<br>choice to the mix actually did what the<br>community wanted in that space and<br>instead of it being a how to keep<br>flooding at bay project it became a<br>project people are increasingly excited<br>about the other problem around car<br>dependence you know wow we we have a<br>problem with choice I'd still say and a<br>problem with safety which has been<br>hitting the newspapers lately well what<br>can we do to vet out value here we could<br>actually invest we can invest 200<br>million dollars in psycho ways over the<br>course of the last three years with some<br>central government funding there's my<br>pitch for Gareth and government and it's<br>about place making and creating choice<br>that we currently don't have I mean I<br>rode my bike here and had to look over<br>my shoulder out at every corner so this<br>is a very real thing for Auckland right<br>now same thing with the city being dead<br>by 501 you know that's when I first came<br>to New Zealand about 20 years ago not to<br>live here but to travel I noticed that<br>the city's sort of died a very quick<br>death after the work day instead now<br>you're seeing increasingly a city that's<br>built for families a city that's built<br>for fun and that's actually facilitating<br>activation of space like here in silo<br>park and then the last example I'll give<br>you is around funding and we were<br>talking a bit about this earlier you<br>know how do you align the funding<br>streams to what outcomes you actually<br>want out of that funding we've done that<br>recently with targeted rates which thank<br>you for those who are paying<br>rates to Auckland Council to actually<br>deliver outcomes like water quality<br>we've also done this this with the issue<br>of New Zealand's first green bond on the<br>domestic market two hundred million<br>dollars that's financing and refinancing<br>our electric train fleet and that's a<br>bit of a first kind of pushing out the<br>boat a little bit to say look the<br>investment community is looking for a<br>different set of outcomes around<br>well-being and this is one of those<br>tools that we've used to get there<br>okay so I've given you from my five<br>examples my confession we are not doing<br>enough and we are not doing it fast<br>enough . so what's at stake obviously<br>we've got issues like oh i have<br>animations that I didn't know about<br>issues like rising emissions here's a<br>reality our emissions continue to tick<br>upward per capita they're starting to be<br>couple they still go upward over time<br>when our stated goal is to come down now<br>we've got GDP growth we've got<br>population growth but other cities are<br>cracking that in delivering zero cotwell<br>more low-carbon solutions with rising<br>populations in GDP so we can - we're<br>also seeing tremendous risks of climate<br>impacts and actually seeing them today<br>in Auckland and I'll get into that in a<br>second so in the emissions side for<br>those who need a kind of primer on what<br>our emissions sources are really it's<br>transport in industry in Auckland it's<br>not agriculture like is the case for the<br>national conversation which makes us a<br>bit different as the largest local<br>authority or regional authority and then<br>the impact side you'll see that you know<br>no surprises here<br>I know seas gonna go up its gonna get<br>hotter rain is gonna get more intense<br>and drought conditions and too wet will<br>actually have been at the same time we<br>are getting smarter about where this is<br>gonna happen and what it looks like<br>between now and 2110 we've done that<br>work and so we could actually inform<br>better decisions around infrastructure<br>and policymaking there's you probably<br>can't read this one it's alright but<br>there are some real issues that will<br>actually result in some of these changes<br>to the climate here regionally in<br>Auckland and of course there would be<br>some site-specific issues to everything<br>from issues around coastal erosion to<br>invasive species to reduced<br>infrastructure resilience<br>so this is a real thing we look forward<br>to the Auckland of not just 30 years<br>from now but actually the Auckland of<br>three years from now and how many you<br>know five hundred year floods are we<br>gonna feel in the next five years it's a<br>really serious issue for us now so I<br>think I'm just about there<br>solutions and what's at stake and how<br>are we gonna move forward really not to<br>be to alliterative here but we need to<br>integrate and innovate there's a reason<br>why there's this kind of cheesy Venn<br>diagram about how you do adaptation and<br>mitigation at the same time because you<br>deliver a whole suite of benefits if you<br>do that and taking away reducing<br>emissions and actually becoming climate<br>resilient if we're really speaking to<br>those maybe outside this room and those<br>who really need to care about this issue<br>we're talking about human health we're<br>talking about social cohesion we're<br>talking about long-term economic<br>productivity those are the things that a<br>real strong push toward climate action<br>will actually get us in the long term<br>future the other things of course we<br>need to involve we're council we want to<br>hear from you and we want to work with<br>you to evolve our plan and we need to<br>invest like I said in the green bond<br>issue we actually need to invest in<br>these solutions to actually make it move<br>forward so here's where I do my<br>shameless pitch I might get another<br>chance to do it when I'm on the panel<br>but we it's it's it's small potatoes<br>because we've got lots of work streams<br>in the area right now of developing our<br>climate action plan but one of those<br>things you could actually log on as<br>you're in this room if you so choose is<br>to climb at a KL NZ it's a crowd-sourced<br>ideas platform that we've just ginned up<br>that says right what are your solutions<br>for how to become climate resilient and<br>low-carbon the best ideas will be fed<br>into an expert panel the best ideas will<br>be iterated over time and will actually<br>feed them into our climate plan so you<br>can be involved right now from your seat<br>if you so choose I think oh and of<br>course all sorts of other engagement<br>including youth events that we've been<br>doing around this work we I think we've<br>had four separate youth events just in<br>the last couple months in this space and<br>a whole host of other activity is David<br>Hall here as well I think he was on the<br>RSVP list I don't think he's here he's a<br>member of our independent advisory group<br>that we have from kind of our mini<br>climate commission so there's a whole<br>range of things we're doing right now<br>that<br>our plan for Auckland but I think that's<br>all the time I have thank you very much<br>hi everyone my name is Emilia I'm<br>currently the interim climate change<br>committee which I'm not going to talk<br>about in my presentation but you can ask<br>me questions about in the panel I am<br>gonna talk about the use your present<br>transition to a llama shins economy so<br>for those who don't know what the<br>Productivity Commission is we're an<br>independent crown entity we have three<br>commissioners and staff of about 20<br>people 15 20 people and we get given<br>terms of reference by the government on<br>thorny public policy issues that they<br>want us to look at really and have a<br>really good look at we do a lot of work<br>on housing we did someone tertiary<br>education which might be of interest to<br>people in this room and then we got<br>given their lower emissions economy<br>inquiry by the previous government and<br>so what happens in an inquiry so we<br>could give in a terms of reference by<br>the government we right take about six<br>weeks to write an issues paper and we<br>put out loads and loads of questions and<br>we want submissions from you on the<br>answers to those questions<br>this inquiry we got more submissions and<br>we have ever had ever at one of our<br>other inquiries got 12 so for over 400<br>was huge for us and then what we do is<br>we go away produce a draft report which<br>has you know answers to most of our<br>questions but still some questions and<br>then a final report this enquiry was the<br>first time we'd had a change of a big<br>change of government the new government<br>said hey keep going but think about not<br>just to lower emissions economy but a<br>NetZero new zealand so i'll explain how<br>we did that in the future well later on<br>so we had lots of submissions we<br>attended lots of events we were really<br>interested in the UK climate change acts<br>we went over there and wrote a note<br>about how that works we had loads and<br>loads of engagement meetings we did a<br>couple of bits of expert modeling so one<br>was on the electricity sector the<br>electricity sector is absolutely central<br>to the transition and then we also did<br>some wider modelling which incorporated<br>land use and energy and<br>idea of uncertainty what do you do in<br>the future when the future is uncertain<br>so I'll talk about that as well and then<br>as I said find a report in August it is<br>I'm sorry over 600 pages you don't have<br>to read all of that there's a two minute<br>video which you can want<br>there's also every chapter xvii chapters<br>every chapter has a one-page summary so<br>you can read the whole report and 17<br>pages so to achieve a low emissions<br>economy we need stable incredible<br>climate policy this is sounds a bit<br>banal but it is absolutely vital you<br>need to sit in place policy that ensures<br>over time that people believe is going<br>to last that they can make good<br>investment decisions and this is<br>individuals making good investment<br>decisions business making good<br>investment decisions and you know your<br>wider civil society so what does this<br>mean really in practice so there's four<br>pillars that we identified under stable<br>and credible climate policy firstly we<br>need to do better emissions pricing we<br>need to reform the ETS as it currently<br>stands so it's a cap-and-trade scheme<br>with no cap so we recommended that the<br>absolutely needs to be a cap we also<br>recommended a separate emissions pricing<br>scheme for biogenic methane so that -<br>methane from waste and from agriculture<br>we proposed that that could either take<br>the form of a dual cap and you seal an<br>emissions trading scheme or a methane<br>quota system so really similar to the<br>fisheries individual individual<br>transferable quota system and I'm really<br>happy to take questions on their second<br>legislation institutions we need new law<br>so fantastic a zero carbon ville exactly<br>what we recommended so that is as John<br>said a series of emissions budgets that<br>ramp up you know that overtime get you<br>to your goal that you have really strong<br>capability within central government to<br>make good plans and then also you have<br>an independent climate change commission<br>who can recommend but not decide on the<br>emissions budgets and what you know some<br>of the work should be done complementary<br>regulations and policies pricing is<br>really important it seems a really<br>strong signal but it's not going to get<br>you all the way there are lots of places<br>across<br>economy where emissions pricing is not<br>going to be the answer so we recommend<br>all sorts of things that need to happen<br>across the economy to support the<br>emissions price you might have heard of<br>our recommendation for a fee bait so<br>that's for electric vehicles so when<br>you're importing electric vehicles if<br>you're importing vehicles over a certain<br>emissions standards you pay a fee if you<br>report them under a certain emissions<br>standards you get a rebate it's fiscally<br>neutral it is regressive however so<br>therefore we also recommend a scrappage<br>policy for those on low incomes to help<br>them move towards electric vehicles<br>because as John pointed out transport is<br>one of our big problems and we really<br>need to ramp up the uptake of EVs and<br>then we've got lots and lots about the<br>complementary policies around in waste<br>and other sectors and then finally a<br>mission investment in innovation<br>innovation is vital if we don't have<br>innovation it's not the whole thing is<br>not going to work the whole point of<br>emissions pricing is that innovation<br>eventually takes over it forces people<br>to do the exciting work that means you<br>don't need to pay an emissions price<br>investment there's enough capital out<br>there to achieve a lower emissions<br>future it's just about redirecting their<br>investment into low emitting activities<br>versus high emitting activities we<br>recommend lots of things around<br>investment one of which is mandatory<br>climate related disclosures for large<br>organizations so you were having to talk<br>about what it is in your organization<br>what the risk is to your business that's<br>really important for two reasons<br>a it helps investors decide across<br>comparable opportunities which is the<br>lower missions option so they can reduce<br>their risk and also it helps the<br>business themselves look internally and<br>say hey hey how can we be more resilient<br>how can we manage our climate risk the<br>zero carbon bill as I said we<br>recommended this first no idea really<br>the emissions budget absolutely central<br>I don't think people really realize how<br>much of a core economic policy emissions<br>budgets are but what if you have a<br>target and your emissions budgets you<br>know a seat to that target it really is<br>going to drive a lot of investment and<br>yes I said I'm on the interim committee<br>I'm not working on the zero cabin bull<br>where we're trying to have a you know<br>firewall between us<br>but you know if people have questions I<br>can hopefully hopefully tell you what I<br>know about what's going on there and<br>then yes short and long live guesses one<br>of my favorite subjects so New Zealand<br>is really really unusual and I don't<br>think some people realize how unusual we<br>are most other developed economies have<br>most of their emissions are co2 which is<br>long lived there is no debate there's no<br>question that co2 needs to get to next<br>era or negative to stop warming it just<br>absolutely has to that any additional<br>co2 going into the atmosphere is going<br>to contribute to warming however<br>short-lived gases and that's mostly<br>biogenic methane but at some hf sees<br>they don't have to get to Net Zero to<br>stop warming this is because the<br>short-lived guess basically the<br>steady-state if you if you think about<br>the bathtub being 2 degrees and you<br>don't want the level of the water to<br>overflow you've got to stop your long<br>live gas and flow but you can have a<br>steady inflow and outflow of short-lived<br>gases this does not mean that the<br>current level of short-lived gases are<br>sustainable there has to be substantial<br>and sustained emissions reductions of<br>short-lived gases but the key message we<br>really you know we found throughout the<br>inquiry they do not get need to get to<br>Net Zero to stop warming and that is the<br>key goal so we recommend separate<br>targets for long and short-lived gases<br>in the zero carbon bill where there is a<br>net 0 target by a specified date say<br>2050 whereas your short-lived gas target<br>is recommended on advice of the climate<br>change commission and the net asset and<br>delegated legislation because the key<br>thing there is that target level is<br>likely to change over time we don't know<br>now in 2018 what the right sustained<br>level of methane is going to be e to<br>stock to you know a limit warming to two<br>degrees so we need some kind of<br>flexibility in the system to allow for<br>that we weed so as I said we did<br>modeling we did modeling to at zero we<br>did modeling to 20 to 25 megaton so a<br>low emissions future we also did some<br>really interesting modeling around<br>uncertainty so most modelling is what's<br>called perfect foresight modeling you<br>know what's going to happen out to the<br>future<br>we don't know what's going to happen out<br>to the future with technology so what we<br>did was we there's some really cool<br>nifty stuff with motto concept and vivid<br>our modelers and what we found was that<br>in any state of the world no matter what<br>technology comes along we will be better<br>off in a future where there are higher<br>emissions prices early so by early I<br>mean up until 2030<br>so if we have stricter emissions budgets<br>which inevitably lead to higher<br>emissions prices in the early stages the<br>overall transition to Net Zero is going<br>to be less costly the reasons why that<br>is is because it helps to avoid Locken<br>of high and missing assets you know<br>decisions that are being made now for<br>that things like boilers and whatnot and<br>then also it spurs innovation as I said<br>before innovation is critical we<br>absolutely need technology to help us<br>with this challenge so the more that we<br>can spur that on the better and the<br>modeling showed us that there are some<br>key changes that need to occur<br>we need to replace fossil fuels and we<br>need to replace them with electricity<br>low emissions electricity across the<br>economy there's things like v's that in<br>process heat it's really is about saying<br>we've got to stop burning fossil fuels<br>and how can we make that happen and then<br>secondly we've got to change land use<br>and there's two aspects to that firstly<br>the modeling showed us and this is just<br>modeling I want to caveat that the the<br>lowest cost way to achieve most of our<br>missions reductions targets is a<br>forestation so planting lots and lots<br>and lots of trees that's our modeling<br>showed us 1.8 - 2.3 million hectares of<br>trees to put that in context a billion<br>trees is only half a million here Dez so<br>in this modelling it showed things like<br>20% of Guzman would be a forested if<br>that is actually going to happen we need<br>to really seriously consider if that's<br>the right future for New Zealand but<br>that's what the modelling at the moment<br>is telling us is the lowest cost way to<br>achieve our targets and interestingly<br>that is mostly from marginal sheep and<br>beef land it's not from dairy<br>it's from land that is currently<br>marginally profitable in its current<br>form and they've secondly we need to<br>change the structure and basis of<br>agricultural production we need to be<br>much more efficient we need to be much<br>better at taking up agricultural<br>innovation and that's it please go and<br>watch the video read therefore and ask<br>me any questions don't get anything<br>everybody I'm Tom Carnegie I'm the<br>executive director of the Business New<br>Zealand energy Council and I'm here of<br>climate change policy at business New<br>Zealand which is New Zealand speak<br>business advocacy organization um hey<br>I'm gonna take a slightly different view<br>and actually dovetails quite nicely with<br>what we've already heard in terms of<br>rather than speaking about specific<br>solutions which of course here are<br>numerous I'm gonna talk a bit more about<br>how business and general thinks about<br>zero-carbon Berlin here we should<br>approach things anymore pepper we can<br>have a richer conversation hopefully<br>after that yeah John started with a<br>confession<br>actually I I have I have an admission in<br>so I thought I'd you know straight off<br>the bed I'd start with an admission of<br>of sorts and it said I don't know the<br>future<br>now actually it's amazing the number of<br>people actually that do or at least<br>admit to doing so I'm sorry to<br>disappoint you<br>now actually it might seem a bit trite<br>in terms of the fact that actually none<br>of us really do right in in fact with<br>the rate of technological change that<br>we're observing no one does though again<br>you might be forgiven for thinking that<br>some some do um because from our<br>perspective actually the future has got<br>if anything harder to predict not easier<br>um even if we think actually that the<br>problem we're solving has become clearer<br>which of course in this case it<br>absolutely has and this last but City<br>quantum quite important I did say that<br>the problem we are solving it's climate<br>change actually has got clearer<br>infect more pressing so you know I hope<br>you weren't expecting a business type<br>like to get up here and rail against<br>climate change because it's not what I'm<br>gonna do but you know I just the<br>question that I'm posing is you know<br>even if we know the direction we need to<br>head in you know how do we know what New<br>Zealand society and the economy might<br>evolve to look like in 2050 and the<br>Productivity Commission that some great<br>work with respected us but you know even<br>a lot beyond you know 20 60 20 70 you<br>know and how do we know what we do now<br>will get us there in a way that can<br>actually retain our high standards of<br>living and actually that we have a<br>prosperous thriving economy and as I see<br>that's you know essentially you know we<br>get smart people all the time actually<br>consistently find organizations<br>consistently failing to anticipate<br>future trends in disruptions and it is<br>because the future is unknowable even if<br>the trends are clear enough but I guess<br>my point is actually with care we can<br>create our future on but it's executing<br>a course of action to a so-called end<br>point that's fraught with difficulty<br>because there are no easy or<br>straightforward solutions to what it n<br>complex problems and in fact if anyone<br>who has one of these probably selling<br>snake oil so that why am i belaboring<br>this point actually most certainly isn't<br>a prescription for an action that's just<br>a plea for carefully considered policies<br>and I guess the point is that if we<br>and I hate to say it there's actually a<br>hell of a lot of us going around and<br>this is what the businesses Eiland<br>Energy Council and business newzealand<br>and general are trying to avoid you know<br>stories about the future that actually<br>require massive leaps and faith about<br>things that might happen so this is the<br>sphere where we get stories based around<br>us all driving electric cars by 2020 and<br>us solving a climate change challenge by<br>a methane injection for cows or worse by<br>our major energy intensive industry<br>closing which I have to say was<br>associated with some of the work that<br>the Productivity Commission put out so<br>in fact that might but it's very nature<br>teamed us towards the conservative end<br>of the spectrum but it's actually<br>important to make sure that the stories<br>that we're collectively telling are<br>credible and pausable not incredible and<br>impossible and so here's a here's<br>another emission of sorts I absolutely<br>hate this word and you actually often<br>hear it bandied about as something that<br>we need or in fact that business and<br>wants especially actually in the context<br>of our emission reduction target<br>certainty you know if only we have it<br>it'll get us to where we need to get to<br>right well actually in my book you know<br>if someone's asking for certainty all it<br>does is it implies that someone who<br>wants someone wants someone who is less<br>well placed to handle the risk to where<br>it and unfortunately in our context<br>that's usually the government that ends<br>up bearing the risk you know government<br>full of very smart well-meaning people<br>but if anyone's going to lose his shirt<br>it'll be the taxpayers but what so what<br>business actually really wants in fact<br>we've already heard heard of this you<br>know they want they want a policy in<br>framework predictability instability you<br>know they want political durability so<br>they want to know what the rules of the<br>game are they don't want to be told how<br>to play it basically you know because<br>I'm telling someone telling business how<br>to play the game actually what you're<br>doing is hardwiring innovation out of<br>the system rather than into it and so<br>what are we doing to help<br>those are some policymakers make good<br>decisions about our future having just<br>told you all that we don't know what the<br>future is well what we're doing is we<br>are leading across sector so that's<br>public and private sector initiative to<br>develop whole of energy sector scenarios<br>and bezzle commonly referred to that at<br>the outset and so also we collaborate<br>collaborating is also mentioned by bezel<br>with Auckland University and in fact the<br>Energy Center for which actually I'm<br>incredibly thankful for the foresight of<br>both bezel sharpen and Golborne thank<br>you God for the leadership and Kitty<br>Silla meinen who I see sitting in the<br>back for her let me call it a leap of<br>courage or faith perhaps and committing<br>to put in the hard yards on our<br>ambitious little projects I think he<br>could he and here are the folk that are<br>involved in the work that we're doing<br>and so you can essentially see it's a<br>very sort of the energy sector and we<br>are incredibly proud of the work that<br>we're doing and our refresh will see the<br>light of day in the next six months<br>and some time so in terms of climate<br>change policy developments you hopefully<br>you know all of us I guess that there's<br>a lot going on actually that's it's a<br>hell of an understatement what we<br>actually have now is incredible<br>incredibly crowded policy and<br>institutional landscape so you know one<br>of the key things actually I think going<br>forward from a business perspective as<br>how it all fits together so how do we<br>transition smoothly to a low greenhouse<br>gas economy end delivery economic growth<br>you know there are some big questions<br>actually as an economy in a society that<br>we need to get our heads around and<br>again one of the things that was<br>mentioned earlier as often the<br>regressive nature of some of the changes<br>you know with the key thing that we<br>learned from the 80s is that the pace in<br>distribution of transition is often<br>uneven so you know we need to be<br>incredibly cautious about there but<br>whatever actually we do needs to work<br>for New Zealand and our circumstances<br>and again hopefully you know<br>all of all of us right so here are some<br>of these circumstances you know we are<br>incredibly well placed as as a country<br>and society you know especially actually<br>when we look at some of the other<br>countries who are trying to lift their<br>renewable emission targets to say 15 or<br>20 percent in here again I mean there's<br>just a nice picture of showing you the<br>nature of that the targets I possibly<br>perhaps politely use the word ambitious<br>you know because there are a number of<br>options on on the table I guess the key<br>thing from our perspective is that and<br>from a business perspective is actually<br>the precise nature of the target meant<br>as a lot to business for business sets<br>for beacon on the hill it'll be there<br>that will help shape the investment and<br>teach-ins for the business community so<br>you know you want to the key point there<br>is about kept needing to calibrate<br>policies in actions to achieve the<br>target I mean and it's quite easy to<br>roll off the tongue a neat target well I<br>actually have no idea what that is right<br>I have no idea what the neat but of our<br>target might be so they're actually you<br>know again it's quite straightforward as<br>I will ever been and it's zero by a<br>certain date but then icky might mean<br>just planting a whole lot of trees right<br>actually that's not really the<br>transition that as a country we need<br>maybe in the short term but certainly<br>not in the long term actually what we<br>need to do is be bending our growth<br>curve downwards end you know we have to<br>a very small extend started to do that I<br>think and over the last couple years has<br>been a two percent reduction and gross<br>emissions so you can just start to see<br>the fresh shoots hopefully of a change<br>in the nature of our economy I mean I<br>guess the key thing from this for a<br>business is the business sector is it<br>the business sector is actually an equal<br>measure both excited by the opportunity<br>but also feeling here's a feeling of<br>trepidation especially if you're in<br>omitting trade exposed sector so there's<br>a need for a lot of conversations to<br>continue over the next several months as<br>I see if not least of which will be<br>around the nature of the targets so<br>access to international units is one of<br>the things that's being talked about<br>linking to other schemes you know how to<br>calibrate stringency of action across<br>jurisdictions how to unlock finance and<br>risk sharing tools now you know again<br>incredibly easy to say but that<br>incredibly complex things to solve at an<br>economy-wide level so how to boost<br>innovation you know all of the the<br>aforementioned relationship to our our<br>in DC as a as a as an economy-wide<br>target and also well we've got an ETS<br>just what that means in terms of the<br>range of other policies that we might<br>want to company in both at the city<br>level as well as nationally it makes you<br>but that one of the things I do want to<br>do is acknowledge the work of well<br>actually I guess now he's not so freshly<br>minted but it was a bad pun the Green<br>Party minister of climate change the<br>Honorable James Shaw who has been<br>working hellishly hard to build bridges<br>to the business community and in fact to<br>the agricultural sector and actually now<br>importantly to the now opposition party<br>you know nifa to create a long-term<br>durable framework all I can say is that<br>some stark stark contrast to what's<br>happening in other jurisdictions you<br>just have to look across that the Dutch<br>to get a sense of that right so you know<br>it's we're on you know climate change<br>policy and Australia is a bit of a<br>bloodsport it seems to be it seems to be<br>least so here thank goodness um in fact<br>when you're talking about ambition<br>actually this is where it ends up right<br>so you know this is the this is the cart<br>the carbon pricing how it's tracked up -<br>well it's hovering around the $25.00<br>fixed price option level the question of<br>course is again you know<br>again if we think we all know the future<br>the question is you know we will let go<br>to next well you know I mention if I<br>asked you what most of you would say<br>it's gonna go up right well you know<br>might but you know we've just seen quite<br>a major correction and the carbon price<br>in Europe so who knows what's gonna<br>happen to this price and there will<br>actually be a function of our stringent<br>but the kid well where we've see it with<br>a cap sorry with a budget sorry we begin<br>to with a target and in how we see the<br>budgets and then also actually whether<br>we retain a price cap because of course<br>we all know you can only control one<br>thing right quantity or price so if you<br>have a price cap<br>thank you you may not get to an<br>ambitious target but very nice so look<br>I'm in terms of business we see both<br>rustic scene opportunities there's<br>certainly more awareness of though with<br>a window of opportunity now because it<br>just makes good sense for business<br>certainly good for the New Zealand ink<br>brand and also you know business sees<br>that the low-carbon economy actually<br>that doesn't just equal in effect this<br>is more widely acknowledged now in the<br>public sector and the work that it's<br>doing that it doesn't just acknowledge<br>that doesn't just equate to the<br>emissions trading scheme alone carbon<br>pricing is an important part but it was<br>just a part of the sustainable business<br>story so the business challenge actually<br>is adjusting to an increasingly<br>emissions constraint issue I've<br>deliberately used the word emission zero<br>because we're here on a panel talking<br>about zero carbon actually it could be<br>zero emissions right so you know we're<br>in a increasingly emissions constrained<br>in price world and the key challenge for<br>businesses particularly those who trade<br>across borders are these two things how<br>to stay internationally competitive and<br>how to avoid investment in carbon<br>leakage in the face of real uncertainty<br>about what others are doing in the<br>asymmetric employee and implementation<br>of climate change policies across<br>countries but of course there are the<br>leaders who see the challenge and want<br>to run it in my friend here John in his<br>council was one of those leaders so<br>congratulations John that's been that's<br>fantastic<br>and I imagine undoubtedly are<br>undoubtedly other organized<br>with representatives here and the<br>audience who belong to us coloration<br>well well dance I mean it's business<br>doing what they do best<br>leading I'm not actually waiting for<br>government to give them the answer so<br>what business wants they want to be that<br>they'll be the key solution provider<br>because ultimately it'll be the business<br>community that will deliver on whatever<br>the target is into what we're striving<br>for in an effect I'm delighted to say<br>what we increasingly have with<br>government as a more mature conversation<br>about the nature of the targets from<br>water what it means across the business<br>community right because there's no you<br>know there's no single representative<br>business there are businesses right<br>across the spectrum from the your heavy<br>emitting energy intensive right through<br>to your service based some organizations<br>for whom the task is somewhat easier and<br>you know going back to the previous<br>point we want a more predictable<br>environment and hopefully a clear goal<br>so it'll be interesting to see what we<br>get out of the the zero carbon bill in<br>government's role of course and this is<br>really important as the over that we<br>want from government we want overall<br>policy coherence so what we want to see<br>is how all of those various parts of the<br>puzzle fit together because they are<br>incredibly complex and so we're wanting<br>government takes you in which is what<br>this government is absolutely doing<br>signal ambition and provide leadership<br>because as I said that will help<br>catalyze and greater effort by business<br>and also you know we want across a great<br>across agency collaboration at<br>ministerial in official level to drive<br>strategically coherent change and again<br>we're seeing that I guess ultimately do<br>we want the government also do a better<br>practice more practice in one of<br>preachers around sustainable procurement<br>actually in wall I've got the floor I've<br>finished with a shameless plug for a<br>summit that we're holding at the end of<br>this month its theme is that of the<br>three DS digitalization decarbonization<br>and decentralization and it see how<br>these forces are at play and the energy<br>transition that we're all aware<br>satori so if you're interested in coming<br>along grab me Amin thanks very much I'll<br>start with the plug hi I'm Caroline<br>Saunders thank you very much for the<br>invite up from Lincoln University down<br>in the sunny South Island although it<br>was a bit misty this day cool so I think<br>I was brought here for the agricultural<br>bit so sorry guys if you know in<br>Auckland a bit and I think one of the<br>first things that culture is important<br>and so if you go to this slide that<br>Agriculture's 6.3 of GDP if you add on<br>the processing industries it's 11.9 and<br>then the other indirect industries<br>probably a lot of jobs in Auckland<br>you're getting up towards 20% of the<br>economy and then there's the Allied<br>which would probably be in there 25% so<br>you can't ignore it now my dream is that<br>we get win-wins the agriculture you<br>talked about change of land use it money<br>land use practice that we get past this<br>culture of more milk more grass more<br>cows and churning the handle out that we<br>get higher value in market for our<br>agricultural products and that's what a<br>lot of what my day job is is finding out<br>where are those premium segments in<br>market we can get our paws on because<br>New Zealand should be high value not low<br>cost of anything high environmental<br>value high social value high cultural<br>value and get those values back to New<br>Zealanders and why aren't we out there<br>like when we were talking about the ETS<br>ten years ago whenever it was out there<br>saying we are the only country in the<br>world that's got agriculture within some<br>kind of carbon policy and I'll say at<br>the minute whether it's ETS or not and<br>sell ourselves right in that thing so<br>thank you you're fed right into that so<br>that's one little rant okay<br>so I thought I'd better look at<br>something about our new about<br>agriculture and energy use which to be<br>honest wasn't a lot but you know<br>agriculture about 4.8% of national<br>consumption but when you add the other<br>stuff it's up to an 30% so again<br>reflecting was the importance of<br>agriculture<br>in the economy we've had an increase in<br>energy consumption in New Zealand so<br>whoo-hoo let's see about bringing that<br>back down but agriculture has increased<br>by more and processing more than that<br>and we're really reflecting the increase<br>in dairy that's gone on combined<br>consumption of Agriculture so you've<br>increased by 3 percent of our export<br>values gone up a little bit more than<br>that we can remember in agriculture and<br>in I don't see this in the debate much<br>it's not just the energy use of diesel<br>petrol or electricity it's the in<br>agriculture of the inputs so fertilizer<br>pesticides herbicides and all them other<br>things that use in agriculture but again<br>the embodied capital and that's when we<br>did the food miles report all those<br>years ago that was the big difference<br>between us and the UK market the other<br>thing is that when we're looking at<br>emissions one thing that doesn't plan in<br>our favor is it tends to exclude<br>emissions from shipping and air freight<br>not that we do much air freight and the<br>elephant in the room of course is others<br>have talked about as agriculture is the<br>big one for greenhouse gas emissions<br>with nitrous oxide 16% me saying 32% and<br>then you've got all the other little<br>bits here so here's the big elephant is<br>there a blonde thank god Amelia's here<br>because she can explain to you in more<br>detail than I ever could about the the<br>methane being a flow gas and oil stop<br>gas I did was reading about it and<br>understood one thing so I was lucky<br>enough to be on the committee set up by<br>Jacinda Chad by Peter Gluckman looking<br>at what was their cat what could happen<br>if we put agriculture into a lower car<br>but you know to reduce the emissions in<br>agriculture and so you know the kind of<br>thing that's command gluckman's reports<br>out there you can get your paws on it is<br>he's actually moved away from<br>agriculture coming under the ETS and I'm<br>not saying it's where it's going to land<br>and there's some issues with agriculture<br>in the emissions trading one is how the<br>hell do you measure it and in particular<br>if you're going to have a map a<br>measurement that has to stand up in<br>court because of course biological<br>emissions by their nature are variable<br>and overseer is a particular tool at the<br>moment the good on it but it was never<br>designed<br>that and there are issues around how<br>they're measured it's also a big issue<br>around point of obligation they want to<br>scheme in incentivize farmers to do<br>things but to have the point of<br>obligation that the farmer would be<br>really tricky so they're talking either<br>processing companies and/or some sector<br>bodies might even do that the one their<br>equipments come out with its farm<br>management plant plans now there are<br>these environmental farm management<br>plans that are being implemented across<br>the country particularly for the<br>passport sector and whether to<br>incorporate a greenhouse gas reduction<br>emissions reduction in there with maybe<br>a fine or something if they don't meet<br>it so another way of this being<br>implemented<br>big debate about whether we include or<br>exclude methane and right with Emilia we<br>need to bring it down but is it a<br>separate gases or a separate policy for<br>that and the billion trees being<br>mentioned and we've got the nitrate<br>limits the water and nitrate limit so<br>I'm concerned that we've got policies<br>everywhere like you said and they're<br>being developed in silos we've not got<br>the conversation across neither at the<br>farm level I think a lots going to<br>matter up the rules of the game what<br>counts as a tree is it a shelter belt is<br>it a small planting and there's gossip<br>at the moment well it's not gossip<br>people and Banks Peninsula that funny<br>little bit that sticks out near<br>Christchurch are buying tracts of land<br>to plant Pinus radiata rent in it and<br>it's the last thing you probably want<br>there or you know be as you said we need<br>that debate about what we want where and<br>it staggered me how little the billion<br>trees would go towards reducing our<br>emissions profile and help us towards a<br>carbon 0 economy so win wins though get<br>out there get more true value for what<br>we do and everything from New Zealand<br>should be high value not low cost thank<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
