hain and I have the<br>great privilege of being the vice<br>chancellor here at the University of<br>Otago and on behalf of the university I<br>would like to warmly welcome this very<br>enthusiastic audience to Paul Hansen's<br>inaugural professorial lecture as always<br>as I look out on the audience today<br>I see academic staff from across the<br>university I see professional staff from<br>across the university I see students I<br>see members of the general public and<br>each and every one of you are incredibly<br>welcome to join us here for this<br>fantastic evening I'd like to extend a<br>very very very warm welcome to the<br>member members of Professor Hanson's<br>family who have come here this evening<br>his mum Judith and his sister Kirsten<br>are here tonight and I know that your<br>presence means a lot to Paul and it's a<br>great signal for the rest of the<br>university about how truly important<br>these inaugural professorial lectures<br>are now like all professors at the<br>University of Otago professor Hanson has<br>excelled in teaching in research and in<br>service to the University and the wider<br>community Paul is very well recognized<br>in the international community for his<br>ability to apply complex theoretical<br>ideas to practical real world problems<br>and as many of you will be aware the<br>centrepiece of Paul's research over the<br>last decade or more has been the<br>development of a thousand Minds software<br>and I suspect that we might be hearing a<br>but the other thing that we all know<br>about professor Hanson is that he is<br>also a highly dedicated gifted and<br>award-winning teacher I personally had<br>the bad fortune potentially of teaching<br>between professor Hanson's lectures Oh<br>in the castle lecture theater when I was<br>teaching first-year psychology and I<br>could tell by the way in which students<br>left that lecture hall that all of them<br>were incredibly inspired by Paul's very<br>very engaging teaching style and I<br>suspect we're going to get to see a<br>little bit more of that this evening as<br>well but last but not least I think the<br>other thing I would like to point out is<br>that Professor Hanson has also provided<br>excellent service both to the division<br>of Commerce and also to the university<br>more widely I for one and I suspect the<br>rest of you share this are very I'm very<br>much looking forward to hearing Paul's<br>lecture this evening so Paul on behalf<br>of the University<br>I would like to warmly congratulate you<br>on your very well-deserved promotion to<br>Professor Nami he Nui aqua and I will<br>now call on professor Robin Gould who is<br>the pro vice-chancellor and the Dean of<br>the Otago business school to tell us<br>just a little bit more about Paul's<br>academic history nor era tena koe to<br>tena koutou tena Tata Tata<br>tena koe tow tena koe tow tena koutou<br>katoa this is a fabulous turnout<br>congratulations Paul Professor Paul<br>Hanson is a tried and true Denis tonight<br>as many of you here will know he studied<br>at the University of Otago where he<br>received his Bachelor of Commerce in<br>1987 he then went on to undertake a<br>post-grad diploma in commerce in<br>economics which he completed in 1988 and<br>then like all good academics went abroad<br>to Australia and we won't hold that<br>against them many of us go to Australia<br>first some of the time Paul went there<br>and undertook a master's of economics to<br>create Australian National University<br>and he completed that in 1991 he then<br>returned to New Zealand to Otago where<br>he completed a PhD again in the<br>Department of Economics and was awarded<br>debt in 1994 now it was that year that<br>you joined the Department of Economics<br>as a member of the academic staff and he<br>undertook a role as a lecturer in that<br>year so he's risen through the ranks now<br>to become a full professor at OU Tiger<br>which is really a stunning achievement<br>now anyone who knows Paul will know that<br>two of his passions are surfing in<br>economics so well I can't comment on a<br>surfing prowess in terms of economics<br>his main research focus for the past 25<br>years has been in areas related to<br>priority setting and resource allocation<br>particularly in the health sector<br>he's the co-inventor as professor Haines<br>said of a thousand mines software which<br>assists with decision making and<br>undertaking people's preferences<br>understanding sorry people's preferences<br>via conjoint analysis or choice modeling<br>he also helped to found a company called<br>go skills which is a global online<br>learning platform and various other<br>proprietary decision making software<br>including software which assists young<br>people to decide on which degree major<br>they might<br>University now Paul will talk a bit more<br>about this this evening and the<br>importance of teamwork and developing<br>these products a thousand Minds of<br>course has been widely used globally<br>with dozens of PhDs and other studies<br>internationally as well as nationally<br>and within the University of Otago by<br>both researchers and administrative<br>decision makers it's resulted in<br>numerous publications Award nominations<br>and awards recognizing Paul's<br>entrepreneurial activity and that<br>includes finalists for seven Innovation<br>Awards these include the Telugu<br>telecommunications use users Association<br>of New Zealand Innovation Award 2009 in<br>which thousand Minds was a finalist the<br>2008 bayer innovators award the 2006 New<br>Zealand Health Innovation Awards 2006<br>Westpac Chamber of Commerce Business<br>Excellence Innovation Awards and the<br>global on tropi --less at Singapore 2005<br>award in association with the Wall<br>Street Journal and that particular award<br>thousand Minds was one of six finalists<br>selected from 148 entries from 13<br>countries so quite an achievement<br>thousand minds of course went on to be<br>the winner of two awards separate from<br>those in which it was a finalist that<br>includes<br>the consensus software Awards in 2007 it<br>was the only czar the only independently<br>judged Awards for Australia and New<br>Zealand software sponsored by Microsoft<br>and IBM and then thousand Minds also won<br>the two N's healthcare Innovation Award<br>in 2005 Paul of course also holds six<br>patents for decision support methods and<br>systems he's been an advisor to a wide<br>range of organisations including New<br>Zealand's far MEC the Ministry of Health<br>New Zealand Treasury Google and recently<br>the World Health Organization where Paul<br>was flown to Geneva where he assisted a<br>group of international experts<br>developing a priority list of antibiotic<br>resistant resistant bacteria in a<br>associated research and development for<br>new antibiotics Paul has supervised<br>multiple PhD and masters students across<br>various different master's degrees he's<br>also been a co-director of o-tar goes<br>highly respected foreign policy school<br>and here's of course as professor Haines<br>has said a very passionate dedicated and<br>a terrific teacher if you've been in any<br>of his classes and I've been witness to<br>several of his classes over the years<br>and he's always brought the class alive<br>which has been wonderful Paul of course<br>and we're very proud of that too of<br>course Paul now that on<br>pro-vice-chancellor and commerce were<br>hugely proud of him as one of her most<br>respected teachers finally Paul's<br>published sixty-seven journal articles a<br>number of major commissioned reports<br>conference proceedings papers and<br>various working papers he's been a<br>regular media commentator over the years<br>reflecting his expertise in economics<br>and his passion for economics of course<br>as a parent whenever he talks about it<br>so a vice-chancellor deputy<br>vice-chancellors ladies and gentlemen<br>Professor Paul Henson will now give his<br>presentation choices are the hinges of<br>destiny can we help people make better<br>ones<br>well I'm amazed to see so many people<br>here it's just incredible as someone<br>told you there are drinks afterwards or<br>something and there are so I'd better<br>get a move on because we've got to get<br>to those thank you so much everyone for<br>coming<br>it almost feels like my 50th birthday<br>all over again with I guess a few<br>differences actually if I'm being honest<br>back but it's so lovely to see<br>colleagues and very old friends<br>including police constable down here and<br>many new friends as well so thank you so<br>much for coming it means so much to me<br>and thank you to the vice-chancellor and<br>in my Dean<br>Harleen in Robin for the nice words I<br>almost feel like I've really got nothing<br>more to add they've kind of stolen a<br>little bit of my thunder it feels but<br>anyway we'll get a crack on so you know<br>what do you think of the outfit yeah it<br>is weird right here<br>so I feel a little bit like a character<br>now so you know I was thinking dyeing my<br>hair for the occasion but I didn't so<br>what I'm gonna try and cover 45 minutes<br>I'm going to try and cover 20 of the<br>best years of my life really exciting<br>stuff at least for me and I'll try and<br>convey some of it so there's a question<br>in my in my talk obviously in the answer<br>clearly I'm going to try and convince<br>you if I can can we help people make<br>better decisions yes we can that's what<br>I'm going to try and talk about today<br>and in particular I mean I'm trying make<br>it general but at some stage I'm really<br>going to have to start talking about<br>myself I guess that's kind of what I'm<br>here for<br>I'm going to talk about an invention<br>that Franz onblur and I that hint some<br>men over on the side they're the paprika<br>method that we came up with to help with<br>the decision-making and our software to<br>implement those methods well then I sort<br>of along the way try and give you a<br>taste of some of the adventures I've had<br>and they do feel like adventures and<br>sort of an economist slash entrepreneur<br>so I've loved I started off I guess as a<br>Marxist actually thinking that academia<br>and sort of avoiding the the world of<br>engagement say through business was<br>where I wanted to go<br>but I soon discovered I think that you<br>know having an impact and doing that<br>through business is a lot of fun so I'll<br>try and talk about some of my<br>experiences there and of course<br>certainly not least I'll talk last of<br>all about I've just mentioned a few a<br>large number of thank-yous to many<br>people who are in this room actually who<br>have really supported me in so many<br>different ways of my life<br>so you know why why do I think decision<br>making is so important well and I do if<br>you think about it making decisions is<br>the essence of being a human being<br>that's what defines us ever since we've<br>sort of crawled out of the cave in fact<br>the decision to crawl out of the cave<br>and look around for food etc and fire<br>was a decision you know is what human<br>beings is all about and so our history<br>as a species is really a history of both<br>good and bad decision making here's some<br>quotes that resonate particularly with<br>me you can read them yourself<br>I think the first three sort of try and<br>convince us how you know important and<br>how magnificent in decision making can<br>be from some very important people but I<br>must admit I think I like I like the<br>last one most of all the the Marilyn<br>Monroe ever noticed that what the hell<br>is always the right decision it's<br>actually the antithesis of what I want<br>to talk about today but nonetheless she<br>says it with such style here's a few<br>examples of famously bad decisions I<br>guess through history right back to the<br>to the Trojans and right through to well<br>a couple of slides back the Harry Potter<br>series again you can read these I'm<br>going to try and get through lots of<br>slides I've got way too many as my want<br>so just sort of touch on a few of them<br>but you know there's lots of examples<br>where people have their lives have<br>changed totally on the basis of a poor<br>decision so again to me I think making<br>good decisions and I've made lots of<br>shitty decisions in my own life I have<br>to admit so I thought I've made some<br>fabulous ones as well so I thought at<br>the india it might be quite interesting<br>if we all play that kind of game have a<br>bit of a think you know some good<br>decisions you've made some bad decisions<br>you've made I put a few examples there<br>don't<br>I hope say of bad decisions coming to<br>this lecture at least wait until the end<br>for that but I thought just for fun it<br>would give me a nice souvenir if they're<br>a little paired here I've divided into<br>with good decisions and bad decisions if<br>you'd like to add to them and you don't<br>have to sign them you can make it<br>anonymous if you want to they'll be<br>great I've started the ball rolling when<br>it comes to you you'll see what I've put<br>down in my own case I'll give you a clue<br>the good decision was applying for this<br>promotion in the beer decision you'll<br>see so anyway it's important stuff so<br>what I've been doing for the last 20<br>years or so has really when I think<br>about it has really come down to<br>ultimately what's an area of decision<br>making I'll give you a lot of background<br>to this but it's called in a fairly<br>prosaic prosaic fish and multi-criteria<br>decision making that's all in the title<br>it's decision making that involves<br>prioritizing something like patience<br>I'll give you lots of examples in just a<br>moment or ranking or choosing from<br>amongst different alternatives and those<br>alternatives could be people people for<br>a promotion to Professor for example and<br>doing that based on considering multiple<br>criteria so for to be made a professor<br>and Harleen talked about its teaching<br>research and service those would be the<br>three main criteria so M CDM is what<br>I've been working on for the last 20<br>years or so including in health<br>economics and it's really a an<br>interdisciplinary subject or area and<br>that's I guess why I'm so attracted to<br>it definitely is part of economics but<br>you know most economists would sort of<br>see it as being a little bit it's<br>certainly not mainstream a lot of it<br>comes from psychology particularly the<br>cognitive in mathematical psychology and<br>of course increasingly it's related to<br>computer science because a lot of these<br>ideas have to be implemented in a<br>scalable and you know a large scale<br>fashion in operations research so it's<br>sort of at the intersection of those<br>three areas which again is another<br>reason why I really like it so just to<br>give you some examples of areas where M<br>CDM apply is basically all these ones<br>and there's another slide with other<br>examples too are all exam<br>where you know something's being<br>prioritized or ranked or considered and<br>then chosen from amongst competing<br>alternatives or the individuals again<br>based on considering multiple criterion<br>and all of these examples and the next<br>ones I'll show you two ones we our our<br>software a thousand mines which I'll<br>possibly try and demonstrate has been<br>used to make these decisions so even<br>believe it or not Homeland Security we<br>sold a license to the National Security<br>Agency for well I don't know what they<br>said we're not telling you and you'll<br>never hear from us again we didn't so<br>I'm guessing what they may have and I<br>really probably don't want to know and<br>that was actually an ethical decision<br>but when you're in business you know but<br>right through right through to some<br>really great examples selecting what<br>sort of trades or characteristics and<br>sheep or cattle or in grasses to breed<br>you know if in the agriculture sector<br>that was lot of work with arbic aspire<br>which has been really interesting a lot<br>of our work and I'll give you some<br>examples is in the area of health care<br>so and that's where it really where I<br>came to this the subject from lots of<br>other things immigration people get it<br>selectively to New Zealand on the basis<br>of some points that they get for the the<br>criteria that the country is assessing<br>them on giving out scholarships getting<br>students into med school again all of<br>these things have those there's<br>characteristics ranking prioritize<br>choosing based on multiple criteria I've<br>heard a rumor I don't know if it's true<br>a friend of mine may have used a<br>thousand Minds to choose as lovely bride<br>it's possible and it's and it's worked<br>out very very well I have to say so<br>basically anything that involves ranking<br>or prioritizing or choosing according to<br>decision criteria are amenable to these<br>techniques so in all of those examples<br>even though they seem very very<br>different and they were they've all got<br>these four common characteristics and if<br>you think about it so many decisions in<br>our life you have these four<br>characteristics and I'll just run<br>through them and then with an example so<br>obviously it's not much of a decision if<br>you even got some alternatives to<br>consider so you some things to choose<br>between some criteria to make those<br>choices or sometimes they're called<br>objectives the really hard bit and this<br>is where<br>and mines and the paprika method that we<br>invented comes in as working out what's<br>the relative importance of the different<br>criteria are they all equally important<br>are some things more important than<br>others could you quantify it and then<br>finally it's pretty obvious but it's<br>part of the mix of course who are the<br>decision-makers who are these who's<br>making these decisions and who are they<br>representing perhaps so a nice example<br>in Robin mentioned that before was a<br>study that I was had an awesome time<br>working with some extremely talented<br>experts and infectious diseases to<br>prioritize these 24 really horrible<br>diseases and the fact that most of us<br>don't know what these are is simply a<br>function of how well antibiotics are<br>working to save us from them so these<br>diseases here are in danger of coming<br>back with a vengeance and they're being<br>kept and controlled by antibiotics but<br>the trouble is a lot of them are<br>becoming resistant to the antibiotics so<br>this group of experts from the World<br>Health Organization wanted to prioritize<br>these 24 from the most important in the<br>most serious down to the least important<br>but still serious so that they could<br>direct universities drug companies and<br>researchers to pour money into doing<br>more research to try and keep these<br>diseases at bay I was shocked when I'm<br>in you know I had never heard of any of<br>these things and apparently if they<br>carry on in the way that they're going<br>in terms of developing their resistance<br>to antibiotics tens possibly hundreds of<br>millions of people are going to die and<br>that's what used to happen in our<br>grandparents time but they kept at bay<br>and fell I got a lot of credibility I<br>knew nothing about it but I had heard<br>see up to seen him it seemed you know<br>they were very impressed with it I think<br>I think I was the only person in the<br>group of 70 who'd actually suffered from<br>one of these diseases so these are the<br>alternatives right so 24 of them we want<br>to try and rank them we want to rank<br>them according to the performance on<br>some criteria that are important for<br>this decision so on the right hand well<br>on the side of the slide down here are<br>the ten criteria that they after a lot<br>of soul-searching came up with as being<br>important for just determining you know<br>what were the most important and I've<br>shown you sex I've cut a four<br>just to make the slide fit and you can<br>see each tried to each criterion here<br>say current treatment options has a<br>number of levels of performance okay so<br>that those are the criteria now the hard<br>bit like I said is how what's the<br>relative importance of these things are<br>you all equally important you know as is<br>the number of people that would die from<br>the disease the all cause mortality is<br>what they call it is that as important<br>is I don't know preventative measures<br>measures in a community setting etcetera<br>etc so working out those relative<br>importance is is very very important and<br>so these numbers down the side here are<br>weights representing how important those<br>things are looks kind of fiddly but it's<br>pretty easy to interpret basically if<br>you think of it this way the the worst<br>disease that you would have would have<br>the highest level of performance like<br>everyone's dying practically from it<br>there's almost no treatment options very<br>high health burden so the highest level<br>there if you add those bolded numbers up<br>and notice they've got a percentage sign<br>you add those that comes to 100 points<br>so the absolute Horsemen of the<br>Apocalypse if you like the truly<br>nastiest disease imaginable it's going<br>to get a score of a hundred and at the<br>other extreme it's almost like this cold<br>I'm sort of suffering from you know at<br>the other extreme sufficient doesn't<br>kill that many people low burden and so<br>on and so forth add all the zeros it<br>comes to zero so that means every<br>disease those 24 that we're looking at<br>are going to be scored maximum of 100 to<br>a minimum of zero and so if you think of<br>it this way there's a hundred points<br>available the way that these numbers<br>came out and this reflects the research<br>14.2% or in other words 0.14 - is the<br>weight on that criterion and you can see<br>that it's diminishing right down to this<br>last one here seven point three out of a<br>hundred so in other words you know the<br>ratio of 14 point two is twice seven<br>point three this thing turned out being<br>more is twice as important as this thing<br>here now of course they didn't just make<br>these numbers up they used two<br>methodology to arrive at it based on it<br>using a thousand minds our software and<br>so the decision makers in this case<br>we're seventy experts and infectious<br>disease diseases from all around the<br>world who are representing their<br>countries etc they went through a<br>process using our software they arrived<br>at the criteria they arrived at the<br>weights and the point of course was to<br>rank order these diseases and there's<br>the final ranking that they came up with<br>and you can see there's the scores they<br>got out of a hundred so this top one I'm<br>not going to try and say it but it's<br>nasty<br>right so if you're in the medical<br>profession you might recognize it you<br>know whopping ninety one out of a<br>hundred you know this is not one you<br>want to get out of control right down to<br>something else hard to say but not as<br>nasty right and the color schemes they<br>are telling us they're sort of their<br>performance it's just codifying those<br>numbers that I was showing you before so<br>that was the final ranking but they you<br>know they wanted to communicate it in a<br>better way so this is just an example<br>from an article that some journal called<br>nature I don't know where they put them<br>in two different groups so they wanted<br>to communicate that all these diseases<br>were really really important but some<br>were like really really importantly it's<br>called it critical through to high so as<br>a medium and you notice it's not 24<br>anymore they grouped some of them<br>because they had similarities together<br>and there I think is my septicaemia of<br>the year I think from that one whatever<br>hear you say that but anyway so that<br>information weed out and it's supposed<br>to guide funding in this area so do I<br>have two contributions and this is very<br>much you know work with Fran's onblur<br>who's been an incredibly close<br>collaborator I wanted to use the word<br>partner but it's taken on such different<br>meanings nowadays he's my intellectual<br>partner I guess we invented this<br>methodology called the paprika method of<br>course it's an acronym you can see what<br>it spells there I'm not going to try and<br>say it published in journals got patents<br>and things like that and implemented and<br>software so that it could be used but<br>lots and lots of people in lots of<br>different areas those areas I talked<br>about before were good examples it's<br>it's really a team effort<br>so maybe it sounds a little bit corny<br>but I kind of you know I think getting a<br>professorship is kind of like getting an<br>award<br>really it's an award for our team<br>actually so there's France there who<br>I've been working with since 2002 the in<br>Kieran Julian Ruben who's here somewhere<br>who is Ruben yep there he goes there has<br>just joined our team recently and Alex<br>gilts is done most of the design and the<br>look and feel of the software and my<br>sister Kirsten has handled the<br>accounting since we started so<br>completely a team effort the Magnificent<br>Seven I like to call us because I think<br>we really are and it's kind of funny in<br>the introduction I was hearing and I've<br>started all these software companies I<br>must be in over here five times to make<br>sure I could work the slides and I think<br>I remember to turn my phone off software<br>I know nothing about but luckily I work<br>with people who do and that's the point<br>so why is M CDM remember that stands for<br>multi criteria decision making why is it<br>so widely used by individuals in groups<br>and I'll give you examples of some of<br>the companies that have purchased our<br>software in a moment well it basically<br>comes down to you can read the words if<br>you want but most of us are more like<br>Homer Simpson when it comes to decision<br>making we sort of go<br>then mr. Spock who's rational and<br>calculates everything and gets all the<br>information and processes it and holds<br>it up and his or her head and does it we<br>may think we're incredibly talented but<br>we're distracted by other things by<br>donuts or whatever and it's not as easy<br>as it looks but in essence it comes down<br>to you know even with the right facts in<br>front of us we often make the wrong<br>choices but it's not very common that we<br>have the right fate so you put those two<br>things together and it's a pretty potent<br>mix here's a really nice metaphor<br>borrowed from psychology this is a very<br>famous optical illusion how many of you<br>would say that those arrows in terms of<br>the horizontal distance between the<br>arrow heads right just the horizontal<br>distance do you reckon they have<br>different lengths or they're the same<br>different lengths so most of us I think<br>in our eyes see them as different links<br>the top one seems shorter right it's an<br>optical illusion you know where this is<br>going they're identical and I again<br>every time I see this<br>I've seen it a thousand times I have to<br>get my ruler out to make sure I'm not<br>fooling myself they're identical so<br>those two those two lines are the same<br>horizontal distance but it doesn't look<br>that way now this is a really nice sort<br>of metaphor for why I think<br>multi-criteria decision making is so<br>useful you know if you think about the<br>metaphor seeing seeing that illusion<br>most of us can't see through the<br>illusion we fall for it every time<br>and yet you know one of our most<br>developed functions as human beings<br>cognitive functions as seeing in an<br>understanding what we're seeing and<br>making some sort of interpretation of it<br>we've practiced it ever since we were<br>born we've practiced it for hundreds of<br>thousands of years as a species as part<br>of our evolution and yet we can't most<br>of us can't overcome that illusion now<br>if you think about the types of<br>decisions that I'm talking about we've<br>got lots of criteria lots of<br>alternatives you're not sure of the<br>relative importance you're trying to<br>weigh everything up all at once you know<br>it's the exact opposite description to<br>that very simple visual thing so it must<br>be much harder to see what's going on so<br>it seems pretty likely you know I'm sort<br>of my rhetorical question the chances<br>are very very high that human beings are<br>going to make very predictable very<br>repeatable mistakes when faced with<br>decision-making characterized as I've<br>characterized it and so you know it's<br>the trade-offs and it's the multiplicity<br>of the criteria that makes it so tricky<br>again I'm not a psychologist and<br>apologies to those of us in the room but<br>there are you know here's and here's a<br>convene a nice list of we like things<br>and teens don't we ten common mistakes<br>that human beings make as individuals in<br>his groups you can see lots of them<br>there there's a few there we could draw<br>our attention to apparently number four<br>at least<br>so apparently mean a much more<br>overconfident then then females and the<br>decision-making I don't know if this is<br>true or not but this is what I hear I<br>really like number seven I go to lots of<br>meetings around the university you know<br>and on the whole the decisions are<br>especially the promotion ones but not<br>always but anyway so you might recognize<br>these from your own life well how did I<br>become interested in this area well you<br>know way back when I did my we talked<br>think in the nice introduction my PhD<br>was in 94 and then I actually started<br>thinking after I'd done my PhD which was<br>in a different area but it's still<br>related to health economics I somehow<br>just became interested in how do you<br>rank order patience for operations in<br>the health system and 20 years ago<br>pre-1998 there were over a hundred<br>thousand people sitting on waiting lists<br>waiting for hip replacements heart valve<br>treatments cataract surgery probably<br>some of you even on them not from I hope<br>pre-1998 but currently so waiting lists<br>are a common feature of you know health<br>care systems like New Zealand that have<br>socialized medicine here's some quotes<br>again I'll let you read them yourself<br>from very important reports at the time<br>that in articles that really drew<br>attention to how unfair this was it's no<br>exaggeration to say that for a lot of<br>people who were being leapfrogged in the<br>waiting lists their only way off the<br>waiting list was to die they were not<br>going to get treated because someone<br>else was always leaping ahead it helped<br>to being white articulate and play in<br>the bridge club as I did in those days<br>and so if you weren't those sort of<br>things you know your chances were<br>somewhat skewed because there were no no<br>agreed criteria or processes to handle<br>this so New Zealand way back in 1998<br>brought in this radical revolution that<br>was the first in the world they<br>introduced what became known as clinical<br>priority access sorry assessment<br>criteria I should know this by now they<br>came out in 1998 for a whole range of<br>different elective services in the<br>Health System and here's one here so<br>this is for an aortic regurgitation I<br>guess throwing up you're a water or<br>something like this no it's a hat it's a<br>heart valve treatment so the patient<br>would come in here's their details up<br>here and the clinician would take some<br>measurements I still to this day don't<br>know what these are I still don't hear<br>but you you know measurements of how the<br>hearts functioning and<br>basically a check would go into each of<br>these boxes the school goes there<br>another tick for this criterion tic tic<br>tic aired up the numbers you get your<br>total score if you have above some sort<br>of threshold you go on the waiting list<br>you get some here's your date when you<br>get the surgery if you're below the<br>threshold you're told to come back in<br>six months if you're still alive right<br>this came out in about 97 98 they were<br>adopted nationwide I looked at them then<br>and I just asked really those first two<br>questions where do the numbers come from<br>but more importantly why do they all end<br>in fives and zeroes it seems kind of odd<br>look at all the numbers are all 10 20<br>etc anyone got any ideas why yeah how<br>many fingers we got it's not a<br>coincidence that the the word four-digit<br>number is the same as word for finger<br>right so we have 10 fingers that we have<br>a base 10 number system so they're very<br>easy to add up now I'm not criticizing<br>the people invented this stuff they had<br>to come up with something they got the<br>criteria they knew what the alternatives<br>were they knew who the decision-makers<br>were they're just struggling with what<br>the weights were remember those four<br>features that I talked about so I<br>wondered if there might be a better<br>method for for doing this and so you<br>know yeah yeah yeah this is where the<br>paprika method that France and I<br>invented starting around 2002 that we<br>turned into a thousand Minds software so<br>since 2004 the ministry has been using<br>our software to basically every six<br>months or so<br>naca had a different point system or<br>CPEC whatever you want to call it for<br>you can see the 16 they are different<br>very important or very important if<br>you've got those illnesses to work it<br>out and the other thing that a thousand<br>minds does again not me my colleagues is<br>they created the the web system or<br>service that implements this across the<br>whole country across all the DHBs<br>for tens of thousands of patients every<br>year and involving all those waiting<br>lists and I'll just show you a few<br>results from this because some of them<br>are quite cool so here's an example for<br>what's known as cabbage just from the<br>acronym coronary artery bypass graft<br>surgery so this is a system that was<br>created a point system again some<br>criteria<br>numbers some weights just like we've<br>been talking about before that's all the<br>stuff ever is but it was to rank<br>patients for this particular heart<br>surgery again a very important one if<br>you don't get it<br>the thing I really wanted to show you<br>was and this is how we started off and<br>we continue to to get the attention of<br>the clinicians because often time the<br>clinicians go you know what we know how<br>to make decisions we don't need some you<br>know paprika method we don't need some<br>software we're experts we've been doing<br>this forever so we often start with just<br>give you the top slide here so say 10<br>clinicians right 10 experts in the area<br>of cabbage surgery and they are asked<br>individually working on their own just<br>using their intuition not using a point<br>system just using what they know in<br>their minds to rank order 12 different<br>patients they get to read the<br>description with all the information<br>about the patient and then each doctor<br>is asked to put them in order there's 12<br>patients so they're asked to rank them<br>from number one down the bottom of the<br>diagram up to number 12 and they do that<br>individually so if you look at this<br>graph it's showing the results of what<br>happens when these 10 experts in the<br>area rank the same 12 patients in terms<br>of the urgency for this treatment so for<br>example patient e most of the 10<br>clinicians agreed that they should this<br>person should be number one one doctor<br>said they should be number three so<br>there's good agreement there and<br>likewise that the other extreme good<br>agreement but look at patient owl for<br>example one doctors said they should be<br>top of the list you can see second on<br>the list right through up to 11th on the<br>list so massive clinical variation again<br>this is not a criticism right this is<br>just natural how human beings you know<br>deal with this complexity they have<br>different things they're looking for<br>different levels of training different<br>things that they emphasize different<br>weights all these things that go into<br>making that decision but I remember the<br>first time I got these results I just<br>very naively has still become the<br>University mindset I said you know what<br>would be really cool to put this on the<br>newspaper<br>they they all wind a different shade of<br>pale and so anyway so that gives you a<br>tension right so then you work through a<br>process using the paprika method coming<br>up with a software create the system<br>criteria and weights and then twelve<br>we'll say four months later that so long<br>it can often take you can do a<br>comparison of what the tool says that<br>the patient's the same patients along<br>the bottom here the order that they<br>should be treated in against the<br>consensus decision-making of the doctors<br>as a group get them to work together and<br>make a comparison and really what I'm<br>trying to show in that bottom graph is<br>see how close they are they're not<br>identical but we've managed to create a<br>system basically that very simple<br>looking system there that more or less<br>captures the preferences of those ten<br>experts in the area so that that's<br>that's why this stuff works and so<br>anyway other countries have adopted it<br>too because this has been pretty<br>successful in lots of other health<br>applications too so just a few of our<br>clients just to give you you know a feel<br>for it here's the Ministry of Health<br>they've been really great<br>ever since 2004 but lots of other ones<br>in New Zealand and lots of others<br>overseas as well who would be actually<br>been paying us you know real real stuff<br>and you know our business model really<br>relies on cash you need revenue when<br>you've got people you paying wages right<br>I mean the vice-chancellor knows this<br>everyone if you've got to pay wages<br>you've got every venue coming in but<br>also for us it's not just about the<br>money it's a real world impact people<br>were willing to hand over you know<br>something of value to them for something<br>that they value from you that's<br>important but the other things that we<br>have been really important to us and<br>that's why it's a three legged stool the<br>store would fall over without the other<br>two things as well as our research<br>outputs which I'll just give you a quick<br>taste of because it gives us so much<br>credibility but also it's a nice way of<br>giving back lots of people all around<br>the world use our software for free or<br>with a small payment to do research and<br>lots of patents and awards which is<br>important for the technical side of<br>things but also protecting our<br>intellectual property so there's just a<br>quick summary of the research outputs we<br>use that about<br>- more than 215 universities around the<br>world for research and teaching lots of<br>other places as well<br>heaps of postgraduate degrees coming out<br>almost can't keep up with them actually<br>closure II is her lien but most of my<br>days start and end with helping people<br>around the world<br>do their research with our software and<br>lots and lots of publications - in a<br>huge range of range of areas it's<br>absolutely humbling you know who would<br>have thought that people would come up<br>with these applications you know you<br>build a tool that people find uses for<br>it<br>in the nice introduction that I received<br>is nice mention of our awards we've won<br>lots of awards and got lots of attention<br>by the way if you want to get noticed<br>listen to the academics on the audience<br>I mean journals are great but Wikipedia<br>is better quick demo should I risk it<br>the non software guys anxiously is it<br>gonna wear ok this is called the<br>Internet we're on the Internet<br>ok so really fast so I'm in my account<br>right so and by the way that we've got<br>9,000 people with access to a thousand<br>minds they've all got their own accounts<br>many of them are paying for us but a lot<br>of the man obviously sorry Ruben it's<br>about to change<br>so here's a demo suppose you suppose you<br>wanted to choose a house to buy and<br>Dunedin for example or even one to go<br>flaring and so I'm just going to work<br>along the top here real fast and I'm not<br>going to show you all the features or<br>we'd be here for ages and this is all<br>game created by Franz and our technical<br>friends and colleagues so here might be<br>the criteria the view matters to you<br>there's the levels the Sun you're in<br>Dunedin unless you arrive in summertime<br>you know privacy you want to walk around<br>naked and if you like me you're not much<br>of a carpenter so maintenance is going<br>to matter ok so I've got four criteria<br>there have made it simple three levels<br>on each again this is a pathetically<br>simple example but it'll do here's the<br>alternatives which are going to be some<br>houses so suppose I'm choosing between<br>I've got twelve dozen houses here here's<br>their addresses and I've rated them all<br>on these different criteria some of you<br>which is great and some of you may not<br>so and they're all rated on the criteria<br>now the question is we've got criteria<br>what's their weights so we're gonna make<br>some decisions in a moment before we<br>make the decisions the weights are all<br>they're equal so these numbers going to<br>change based on some questions now<br>here's the this is how the paprika<br>method I'm not going to give you the<br>technical side the technical side is<br>mind blowing Lee crazily difficult if I<br>say so myself<br>thank God we wrote it down when we did<br>because I wouldn't better remember it<br>now it basically asks a whole series of<br>trade off questions it's all about P<br>wise comparison comparing two things at<br>once involving a trade off so here's<br>here's a hypothetical home over here<br>here's another one and the trade offers<br>if you like views the one on the right<br>would be better if you like son the one<br>on the left would be better but now<br>you're being asked to basically trade<br>off you haven't got a view but it's<br>sunny you've got an awesome well a view<br>but it's not spectacular there's a bit<br>of level not much Sun what do you want<br>okay so some of you're thinking this<br>through I'm going sunny yeah okay so<br>just going to keep trying up combos like<br>this spectacular<br>not much spectacular and spectacular so<br>anyway you see the choices right and so<br>it just keeps trying up different<br>combinations always involving a<br>trade-off always with the P wise<br>comparison over and over again yes it<br>gets a bit tedious but this might be an<br>important decision even more important<br>than choosing a house and Dunedin<br>perhaps just keeps throwing them up and<br>as I answer the questions basically I'm<br>training the software about what the<br>trade-offs are and it's going to be<br>reflected in those weights that I talked<br>about this is the paprika method without<br>the myths now by the way just what I'm<br>doing this clicking buttons talking to<br>myself here someone else tried this back<br>in 1976 and said it was impossible thank<br>God we didn't read that because we<br>didn't we knew we didn't know this area<br>we were lucky<br>ignorance was really unfortunate so<br>there are the weights that have come out<br>notice they've all changed so if this<br>was me doing it for real clearly it<br>wasn't privacy is most important<br>followed by Sun followed by maintenance<br>and then last of all view now this<br>actually isn't how I would see the world<br>but I was just doing it randomly<br>then we use those weights right we want<br>to rank those houses ah 37 coast roads<br>come up top it's a nice property<br>actually it's got to speak take it in<br>here now so there's the score out of 100<br>there's the ranking so it's pretty<br>straightforward now I think of all the<br>different things you can apply this for<br>now there's other things that might<br>matter as well I won't go them through<br>but but through them but clearly prices<br>one thing for most of us right those<br>other things might matter so we might<br>want to go the whole hog and actually<br>represent what Franz and I called the<br>the value for money chartered and<br>officers reproducing very prettily in<br>the background but it looks pretty good<br>so basically we've got price along the<br>bottom benefit out of a hundred along<br>the vertical so presumably you're really<br>drawn to the ones near the top left<br>really good houses not too expensive any<br>down this end you know which there<br>aren't thankfully I was told not to<br>point my finger point with the cursor<br>well that's there it goes you know down<br>there would be expensive and not very<br>good up here is really good and not too<br>expensive so you can go on like that and<br>for the okay for the economists I know<br>you're going to say tomorrow there<br>wasn't much economics that line is the<br>Pareto efficiency frontier okay happy<br>now there you go<br>now let's see if I can shut this down<br>without killing my slides right so<br>that's that's the paprika method in<br>action that's a thousand Minds but it<br>does a whole lot more of course oh yeah<br>and by the way other people do this<br>stuff too there's a really big industry<br>out there and by the way it's nice to<br>move into a big industry you don't want<br>to be the first when there isn't you<br>know other people there as well this is<br>from Wikipedia obviously is the other<br>ones I've yellowed the our main<br>competitors the others are kind of Wow<br>you know they're pretty good but but<br>they're not really as large as decision<br>means an expert choice and notice to you<br>all using different methods now in the<br>interest of time I think I'll go through<br>I won't do this I was going to talk<br>about how the weights are determined<br>right so you saw how a thousand minds<br>does it there's lots of other ways we do<br>it in a different way that's why we've<br>got patents for it and I think I don't<br>know if you would agree with me but you<br>know answering questions like that<br>aren't that difficult you've got to just<br>make choose one thing from - would you<br>like a beer would you like a wine I have<br>both<br>you know we're used to making those<br>sorts of decisions other methods do it<br>in a much more complicated fashion is<br>really all I'm trying to communicate<br>there now in the last 15 minutes I just<br>thought I'd give you a few you know war<br>stories out of my my of my life so in<br>1980 when I was 14 years of age I came<br>across two things that have been totally<br>my central being ever since one was<br>economics and the other one was surfing<br>and you can see those two things here I<br>had an amazing who I had a series of<br>great teachers at school but one in<br>particular race Spence really turned me<br>on<br>at Bayfield to economics in surfing well<br>that just kind of happened<br>for the surfers and the where's that top<br>break don't black haired Haldane yeah<br>it's an old photograph too anyway so why<br>do what you know it's obvious why I'd<br>love surfing how could you not but why<br>would you love economics well I didn't<br>have these quotes in my mind at the time<br>I've since discovered them but here's a<br>couple of things that really resonate<br>and says it all for me two very famous<br>economists economics is a study of<br>mankind in the ordinary business of life<br>who wouldn't be interested in that in<br>Robert Solow<br>much later of course but summarizes what<br>economics is about we teach our kane<br>models and complicated theories<br>absolutely we do but the whole point he<br>so beautifully puts as we're<br>intellectual sanitation workers to cut<br>through the using those models<br>and theories we're not doing the models<br>and theories for their own sake we're<br>doing them to make sense if you like of<br>the ordinary business of life I think<br>that's a lovely way of putting it<br>if I was writing a graduate profile for<br>people coming out with an economics<br>degree for a university I think I'd use<br>what very famous economist John Maynard<br>Keynes Lord Keynes had to say about<br>Alfred Marshall that guy over the first<br>quote look at the characteristics that<br>he ascribes to Alfred Marshall of course<br>as one of the beasts and so you know I<br>would love to be even close to that I'm<br>never will be but<br>look at all the different things that<br>are that a master economists to the<br>gifts that he or she must have so you a<br>nice graduate profile for your turnouts<br>do we try and turn out students like<br>there but we only have three years to do<br>it on the whole and so actually I<br>formally you know got the job I'm<br>currently in 95 or something but I<br>actually joined in 1989 as an assistant<br>lecturer I don't even think I had a job<br>interview they just needed someone to<br>teach a first-year class at 4:40 and boy<br>that was the Longest Walk of my life and<br>I might as well tell the story now my<br>second victory of in 1989 kiri who's<br>here in disguise came along this time as<br>ski goggles on and made me squeak which<br>I'm pleased I haven't done today yeah<br>anyway so that was our that was our<br>department I'm sorry to say to those<br>people in that photograph are no longer<br>with us<br>which is a sobering thought because you<br>know the young people all at the back<br>I'm one of the ones and that you can see<br>me in a homespun jersey top yeah I wish<br>I've still got of course and there is<br>Michael Cooper argit just Gupta Priya<br>Tosh matron John hell's Pete Henderson<br>Nancy Devon who can Byram lots of really<br>great people Nancy's still alive the<br>others sadly aren't Mike just died last<br>year but they they were the greatest<br>people they so turned me on to it and<br>really you know they took a chance on a<br>surf which was a pretty risky thing to<br>do so anyway that's if I see before I<br>begin 95 I sort of started thinking<br>about this and it lead into to our<br>software and then we went on sabbatical<br>and I thought about I've been thinking<br>about this math problem you know just<br>percolating away and then one day on my<br>first sabbatical and boys sabbaticals<br>are great if you haven't gotten to that<br>you really should I'm on the way to Ikea<br>of all places in Sweden and I'm not too<br>fussed about that but I started thinking<br>about this problem again you know again<br>related to basically where do the<br>numbers come from and is there a better<br>way and I kind of had my my big Eureka<br>moment and then Fran's onblur who I meet<br>when I worked at the Treasury on a<br>one-year secand mint which was a great<br>experience too in 1996 a mutual friend<br>put us together and I meet up with<br>Fran's over coffee<br>and I got as a tension which was<br>remarkable I remember saying to when we<br>talked about the ideas I had had just so<br>my back-of-the-envelope proof I said I<br>wouldn't be surprised if we could<br>publish this in a maths journal and he<br>goes and I go how cool would that be<br>and he goes he leans foot and goes here<br>that'd be so cool and so when someone<br>says that especially if they're not an<br>academic you just know right and so and<br>so friends he's an amazing computer<br>expert again you know so so great<br>created he brute forced I won't again<br>explain it but pages and pages and pages<br>and pages and pages and pages of numbers<br>like that came my way one day and he<br>said to me as he sent them to me I bet<br>there's a pair some sort of patent in<br>those numbers and so I kind of had an<br>autistic moment and came up after about<br>seven weeks of drooling with Believe It<br>or Not an equation and one day when I<br>get a tattoo across my shoulders that's<br>that's gonna be there and so then Franz<br>and I work together and turn this<br>equation it sounds crazy but that's the<br>basis of our patent patenting an<br>equation and everything that flows from<br>it now clearly I'm not explaining read<br>the Wikipedia article if you're<br>interested so in 2003 we thought hey we<br>should form a company right and so we<br>wanted a logo of course and in those<br>days we were hello go right and so by<br>the way you know this is a nod to that<br>and the brief we gave our great designer<br>in those days it wasn't Alex it was<br>another guy it had to look good on a<br>surfboard and it had to look good on a<br>big mainsail on a large ocean-going<br>yacht that's what Franz was into right<br>and that does look very good on both of<br>those things<br>we started getting our patents we<br>started selling it we started getting<br>money the system was rolling you know<br>really exciting times while holding down<br>a job at this great institution all the<br>awards hire no just became a real award<br>junkie for a while it was kind of fun<br>it's just like writing an article but<br>it's about yourself if you're good with<br>words we joined upstart business<br>incubator in Norman Evans and Mary downs<br>were great when a bunch of awards<br>one of the first things upstarts said<br>was we love you patent but dude no one's<br>paying twenty thousand dollars for their<br>for a license for their right anything<br>with the word wizard and it's got to be<br>free so they paid us to change it came<br>up with a thousand minds we started<br>working with Alex Gilks his design<br>company Alex was an amazing designer he<br>came up their logo and the whole look<br>and feel of the software everything<br>we've done the design Studies department<br>here at O Tago was practically my second<br>home her color blind man would walk in<br>and commit all sorts of design faults<br>but these guys particularly Nick lead<br>but all his wonderful colleagues were<br>just so welcoming and have continued to<br>be enormous debt of gratitude to those<br>people awards selling national all sorts<br>of prop 1 we get the NSA border license<br>rushing through it here I want to try<br>and finish so I can go for a drink yeah<br>all good stuff you can see it they're<br>really exciting really fun a lot of it<br>overlapped with my academic work which<br>is really important again publications<br>we started building other products<br>related to in this case choosing courses<br>that people might want to study and we<br>even tried to do the whole at the United<br>States I mean how crazy is that that<br>failed miserably like just so badly we<br>2014 Google bought a license now that<br>was exciting and in fact what was really<br>exciting was when this email showed up<br>my inbox right I thought the syntax here<br>is so much better than a Nigerian scam<br>this is written by this I mean better<br>see that can't be for real right of<br>blanked out the names but that's a true<br>I'm an engineering manager at Google you<br>had me at hello so and the guy on the<br>left that's me of course Franz and I<br>went for a week to the Googleplex it's<br>like that movie you know what's that<br>tall guy and that short blonde guy have<br>two broken nose the interns or something<br>I was by far the oldest the least<br>computer savvy and the hungriest they've<br>got all these restaurants there and<br>basically while I was eating Franz was<br>installing our software on their servers<br>for huge sums of know for good sums of<br>money we branched out we also branched<br>out so getting to know interesting<br>people was what our journey were my<br>journey in particular has been about<br>Bevan Itza house a graduate from Otago<br>and lots of areas she pitched to us that<br>we should start doing online education<br>so we moved into that and boy is that<br>going gangbusters check out there check<br>out that website and the courses that<br>are available some time and most<br>recently we've procured we've partnered<br>with a procurement management company<br>with our software so basically embedding<br>our methodology in their software to<br>help with procurement decisions and<br>they're paying us a license which is<br>just fabulous so I'm doing quite well<br>timewise so we got a whole lot of other<br>things on again I won't go through them<br>all but there's one that there's one<br>layer that I do just want to talk about<br>which I am so excited by this one was<br>Bridget and Kate is to try and see if<br>those trade-off questions that I showed<br>you before the paprika method would be<br>amenable to people with intellectual<br>disabilities to make important decisions<br>in their life and so we've got a grant<br>and that we're hopefully going to get on<br>the Mars and fund for that and I'd just<br>be so thrilled if it comes off because<br>you know if we could help you know<br>people who need help to make important<br>decisions that would just be fantastic<br>but other projects as well<br>so I want to finish on just<br>acknowledging a whole bunch of people so<br>many of whom here today obviously my<br>family I've got lots of families<br>actually here there are a thousand Minds<br>is one of them my colleagues in the<br>Department of Economics is another and<br>so many people that I've worked with<br>over the years co-authored things<br>collaborated with and I'm sorry if I've<br>left anyone off I've got another three<br>pages two pages to go so don't don't get<br>anxious just yet if you're not there but<br>you know some really great people past<br>and present colleagues as well who have<br>really made a huge difference to my life<br>it takes a village to raise an<br>entrepreneur is it right<br>cheesy lots of lots and lots of students<br>to that I've had the great honor in a<br>real honor it has been to help them with<br>their degrees whatever they've done so<br>that's I think most of them since 1994<br>and you know many of these people have<br>gone on to do amazing things in many of<br>the others are about to ever kiss bio<br>has been really important to us<br>particularly peat fantasy but also has<br>other awesome colleagues we've worked<br>with him a lot and lots of other great<br>people from around Dunedin in the<br>business world and in the the science<br>world and innovation etc again the<br>department of design studies a fantastic<br>department and lots of people that I've<br>had the pleasure of being hosted by on<br>three sabbaticals that I've been on I<br>would love to have had one up there for<br>the United States Chicago but that<br>didn't quite turn out homeland security<br>oh sure that would have been funny<br>putting Homeland Security up or next<br>time I in the Ministry of Health that<br>certainly last but not least to all my<br>very many great friends who I really<br>adore so thank you very much<br>right<br>I'm Paul Thor's ness I'm the current<br>head of the department of economics and<br>I'm here to first of all thank Paul for<br>just a fantastic presentation everything<br>I expected it's it's really intimidating<br>coming up here behind you and I also<br>just need to say a few I'd like to say a<br>few things to sum things up as a little<br>bit of background I've had the good<br>fortune for the last 15 years of having<br>the office two doors down from Paul yeah<br>and that's that's resulted in a lot of<br>great conversations of course and a<br>thorough a thorough introduction to<br>1,000 months however I cannot count the<br>number of times when I've heard Paul<br>down the corridor in the midst of a<br>he's thinking of a kind of waste that's<br>a bit hard to recognize but that's<br>really important the waste that arises<br>from poorly allocated resources because<br>it's hard to see what it's not being<br>produced what we're not getting we have<br>a lot of ways we we're very keen to<br>explain and identify treatments for this<br>kind of waste we usually conventionally<br>call on laws in the economic system like<br>you know not enough competition or not<br>enough control over what gets emitted<br>into the environment but researchers in<br>psychology have also added and<br>demonstrated that there are flaws in us<br>as well we're limited in our<br>decision-making capabilities one way so<br>Paul has ball fights waste that's the<br>thing that's the big thing just think of<br>the waste he's dedicated one way he<br>fights this kind of waste is through his<br>teaching and outreach activities Paul<br>spent a lot of time in big rooms<br>teaching economics at every level<br>and this is tiny compared to compared to<br>castle two and so forth<br>he's that's we've already heard he's a<br>very popular and effective teacher he<br>focuses the way he does it I think is he<br>focuses on very practical ways to<br>recognize both recognize economic waste<br>and to divide it I think this has had<br>probably had a lot of impact over time<br>he's been here what thirty years<br>teaching five hundred plus students in<br>first year 250 and second year and so on<br>there's thousands of people each one<br>influenced maybe just a little bit many<br>of them now of an age where they're<br>leading companies this is really really<br>bigger than you might think another one<br>of those you know hard to recognize<br>impacts you know that's Paul in his role<br>as an intellectual sanitation worker a<br>much less common way of course to reduce<br>economic waste is to build and<br>successfully market that's a big one<br>actually and successfully market a a<br>cool piece of kit to improve decision<br>making and that's what we've heard all<br>about tonight right you know obviously<br>he was concerned he was motivated by his<br>concern for inefficiencies and how how<br>patients were being Alec prioritized to<br>enter the healthcare system and the<br>reason decisions like these are<br>difficult because they involve multiple<br>decision makers and have and we have to<br>make really hard trade-offs really hard<br>Paul and Fran's<br>bit built thousand minds on the Eureka<br>the story is actually bigger than he<br>indicated to reek idea that underpins<br>the paprika algorithm<br>you know it's having big impacts just as<br>he showed it's having impacts directly<br>through his commercial users awfully<br>impressive list with World Health<br>Organization Google and so on and<br>indirectly through the support it gives<br>researchers both locally around the<br>world more than 200 researchers<br>including myself<br>you know given my you know introduction<br>I I've used it myself to PhD student<br>psycho supervised one with one with Paul<br>and three other masters students of all<br>really found some interesting stuff from<br>thousand Minds so I want to give Paul<br>our sincere congratulations on behalf of<br>the economics department for your<br>promotion</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
