Manoa ROA rocket Adama tena koe tu<br>tena koutou tena tatou katoa good<br>evening everyone my name is Harlan hain<br>and I have the great privilege of being<br>the vice chancellor here at the<br>University of Otago and I am a static to<br>be here to warmly welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for<br>stephen knowles<br>again as I look out on this illustrious<br>audience I see lots of people that I<br>recognize both staff and students from<br>the University of Otago as well as<br>members of the wider Dunedin community<br>and on behalf of the university I would<br>like to warmly welcome each and every<br>one of you but I'd like to take a moment<br>to issue a very special welcome to the<br>members of Stephens family who are here<br>with us this evening<br>his mum Valerie his wife Joe his<br>children Abby Samuel and Joshua his<br>brother Michael and Michael's wife Gayle<br>have all come here to join us in this<br>fantastic celebration so we're all here<br>tonight to really congratulate Stephen<br>on an amazing achievement and becoming a<br>professor at the University of Otago is<br>really a lifetime achievement and it<br>comes on the back of outstanding<br>performance in teaching in research and<br>to service to the University and the<br>wider community and Stephen has more<br>than exceeded our expectations for the<br>promotion to Professor as many of you<br>will know he is a effective and popular<br>teacher both in the classroom and in the<br>context of postgraduate supervision he's<br>also an outstanding researcher over the<br>last seven to eight years<br>Stephens primary area of research has<br>focused on charitable giving and I think<br>tonight on the basis of his title we are<br>going to hear more about how New<br>Zealanders give who they give to and how<br>their choice of charity impacts the<br>greater good but last but not least<br>Stephen is also an outstanding<br>University citizen he has provided<br>excellent service to the department of<br>economics to the division of Commerce<br>and the university more broadly he is<br>someone that I know I can always count<br>on in my view this is a mark of a true<br>leader departments and universities<br>quite frankly need more people like<br>Stephen and if I could clone him I<br>certainly would<br>so Stephen on behalf of the University<br>of Otago I would like to richly<br>congratulate you on your very very<br>well-deserved promotion to Professor<br>Nami he knew a Quay and I will now call<br>on professor Robin Gould who will tell<br>us just a little bit more about your<br>academic journey<br>noreda tena koe tena koe tota no Tata<br>Tata<br>lieutenant koto tena koe ten DeCoteau<br>katoa a very very good evening to you<br>all<br>very warm welcome it's an honor here to<br>address you very very briefly before<br>handing it over to Professor Noel's what<br>does it want to say a very very special<br>welcome to Stephens family for coming<br>along here tonight some of you I think<br>it's your first time ever to see dad<br>speaking so well done good on you for<br>being here and I just want to say huge<br>congratulations to professor Knowles as<br>well this is a really really important<br>occasion because it's a time to really<br>celebrate his achievements to date in<br>his career which is really only partway<br>through because becoming a professor can<br>happen at all sorts of points in time in<br>one's career and Stephens done it at a<br>fairly young age I think so<br>it's huge congratulations and well done<br>Stephen at this point in time and we<br>really really look forward to all of the<br>work you have ahead of you which will go<br>into all sorts of directions I'm sure so<br>just a few very brief words on on why<br>Stephens here tonight giving an<br>inaugural professorial lecture so<br>professor Stephen Knowles is a product<br>of Otago University and he's a very<br>dedicated faculty member of Otago<br>through and through as professor Haines<br>has already said this evening he<br>received his Bachelor of Commerce degree<br>with honors from the University of Otago<br>in 1990 and went on to enroll in further<br>research study commencing his research<br>career at otaku and receiving his PhD in<br>economics from the University of Otago<br>in 1995 professor Knowles then showed<br>very showed in fact prior to that early<br>promise in collecting a University of<br>Otago postgraduate award in 1992 and<br>then the mcandrew stout postgraduate<br>award in economics in 1993 he joined the<br>Department of Economics as a full-time<br>lecturer Weka Demick staff member as a<br>lecturer in 1994 he had previously held<br>positions in the Department of Economics<br>as a part-time tutor and a part-time<br>assistant lecturer so to go on and join<br>the department as a full-time lecturer<br>is both a significant achievement but<br>also in Stevens career was a natural<br>progression<br>now since appointment as lecturer<br>professor Knowles's career has<br>progressed to senior lecturer in 1999<br>then associate professor in 2006 to<br>where he is today as a full professor in<br>one of o-tar goes leading departments<br>and one which is world ranked because in<br>the area of course that Professor Noel's<br>largely works in which is Development<br>Studies in economics<br>Oh Tiago sits in the global top fifty<br>which is no mean feat and professor<br>Knowles has been an important<br>contributor to that ranking in that<br>particular area and to the high regard<br>in which the Economics Department has<br>held internationally as well as<br>nationally he's been a dedicated<br>contributor to the department over the<br>years to the Business School and the<br>University of Otago he was head of<br>department from 2010 to 2012 known to be<br>a straightforward and steady<br>administrative leader valued by his<br>colleagues and as the vice-chancellor<br>was said by others across the university<br>before that he was deputy head of<br>department for a period of time as well<br>he's provided very important leadership<br>in teaching contributing to development<br>of the new Bachelor of Commerce core I<br>won't bore you with the details but it<br>was quite an achievement at the time<br>when I think it was put in place and<br>agreed to and to its governance and<br>continues to be very very involved in<br>the becon core in that regard as well as<br>in teaching he's known to been engaged<br>in highly rated teacher including by as<br>many PhD and masters research students<br>over the years he's served on various<br>university committees at different<br>levels always bringing his balanced and<br>frank approach and analyses to the table<br>which I know is hugely appreciated you<br>can always expect from Steven a very<br>honest very frank but very very balanced<br>analysis of a situation which I<br>personally greatly appreciate as well<br>he's a dedicated servant to the<br>economics profession and through a<br>six-year period he was vice president<br>then immediate past president of the New<br>Zealand Association of economists he's<br>reviewed academic research papers for a<br>large range of journals and sits on the<br>board of the well-regarded Journal of<br>behavioral and experimental economics<br>professor Knowles has been a visiting<br>fellow at a number of universities<br>including Nottingham Cambridge Melbourne<br>and University of Ottawa he has two main<br>research interests experimental<br>economics and empirical modeling of<br>economic growth and development his<br>recent work in experimental economics<br>has focused on the determinants of<br>donations to international development<br>charities and to measuring trust<br>professor Noel's work on economic growth<br>and development includes analyzing the<br>effects of gender inequalities in<br>education and health on economic growth<br>the relationship between social capital<br>and economic performance the effects of<br>government intervention on economic<br>performance and the relationship between<br>economic inequality and economic growth<br>and he's published in a range of<br>journals in all of these fields his<br>teaching interests include the economics<br>of development developing countries and<br>introductory micro economics tonight<br>Steven will explore why it might be that<br>less than 10% of charitable donations in<br>New Zealand go to international<br>development charities when those seeking<br>to do the most good would be expected to<br>donate to the likes of health projects<br>in developing countries Sir Vice<br>Chancellor deputy vice-chancellors<br>ladies and gentlemen professor Stephen<br>Knowles will now give his presentation<br>well good evening everyone<br>my biggest fear this evening was that<br>I'd forget to turn the microphone on I<br>seem to have survived that test okay<br>thank you all for coming<br>it's wonderful to see so many friends<br>and colleagues here from around the<br>university as well as friends from<br>outside the university and I see a good<br>number of people here from my local<br>church so good to have you here as well<br>the really special people to have here<br>they are the members of my family my mum<br>my lovely wife Joan my wonderful<br>children Abbie Samuel and Joshua my<br>brother Michael his sister his wife<br>Gayle not a sister his wife Gayle<br>it's mistake number one and also my<br>niece saman who's studying here at Otago<br>really nice to have you here saman thank<br>you for those words of introduction<br>vice-chancellor and Robin as they noted<br>my association with the University of<br>Otago goes back a long way but it<br>actually goes back somewhat further than<br>what they acknowledged now don't look<br>shocked when I say this mum but I was<br>actually born on the University of Otago<br>campus now mums probably thinking what<br>the heck is he talking about but of<br>course I was born in Queen Mary<br>Maternity Hospital which is now Heywood<br>College so what I'm going to talk about<br>this evening is the question does<br>charity begin at home or overseas and<br>that's the main focus of this talk but<br>before I get to that I want to reminisce<br>a little bit about some of my early days<br>in the department and talk very briefly<br>about some of the earlier research work<br>I did before I get to this question I've<br>got to remember not to point at the<br>screen but to use the mouse here I<br>promise I'll get that right so the early<br>years I'm going to show you some<br>pictures of things that tell a bit of a<br>story for me so that one there is me<br>this photo was taken on the occasion of<br>Priya Tosh matrice retirement back in<br>the mid 1990s<br>this is Priya Tosh here that's his wife<br>and that's John Hill's who was head of<br>the economics department at the time and<br>Priya Tosh was one of the supervisors of<br>my<br>PhD thesis he also taught me at third<br>and fourth-year level I did his<br>development economics courses and he<br>supervised my honors dissertation it was<br>him that encouraged me to pursue<br>postgraduate studies particularly in the<br>area of development economics and I'm<br>really so grateful that he did Priya<br>Tosh was a wonderful man<br>and he's one of those sort of<br>old-fashioned academics as well he never<br>wanted to use a well you ever wanted to<br>go near an overhead projector a<br>whiteboard was a bit modern for Priya<br>Tosh only a chalkboard would do but he<br>hadn't really ever perfected using a<br>duster so he'd use his hand to rub stuff<br>off so you can imagine chalk flying<br>everywhere by the end of the lecture and<br>one of my favorite memories of Priya<br>Tosh was the time that he made a mistake<br>one day in class and then shot whacked<br>himself on the forehead but of course<br>his palm was covered in chalk so he had<br>this palm print on his forehead for the<br>rest of the lecture so that's Priya Tosh<br>here's someone I remember very fondly<br>sadly he passed away only a couple of<br>years after retiring another motivation<br>for me in terms of getting involved in<br>the area of economics I have is this<br>book that I remember reading round about<br>the time I was studying priya Tasha's<br>development economics courses a book<br>called rich Christians in an age of<br>hunger and this book's main theme is<br>that a key theme in the Bible was the<br>importance of looking after the most<br>vulnerable members of society and ciders<br>argument was that in the globalized<br>world in which we live<br>the most vulnerable members of society<br>are actually those in developing<br>countries overseas and and that had a<br>profound effect on me reading that and<br>that helped reinforce my interest in<br>doing development economics here's my<br>other PhD supervisor<br>that's Dorian Owen I tried to find a<br>photograph of Dorian from the same sort<br>of era as the black and white one there<br>on the left but I couldn't so I just<br>grabbed the photo that was on our<br>departments website the good news is<br>that's how I remember Dorian looking<br>back in the mid 1990s I don't think he's<br>aged very much at all so just imagine<br>that some black and white and that's<br>what Dorian looked like back the<br>but durian was a brilliant supervisor of<br>my PhD thesis and I'm ever so grateful<br>for the guidance he gave me back then<br>and he very much took me under his wing<br>in the early years of my career and for<br>many many years after I completed my PhD<br>Dorian and I worked on a lot of research<br>projects together and I think he's<br>probably the co-author that I've worked<br>with the most although I haven't<br>actually added up the numbers to check<br>that there's been a bit of banter in our<br>household over the last few months about<br>what the abbreviation IPL actually<br>stands for so you all know it stands for<br>inaugural professorial lecture but it<br>also stands for Indian Premier League<br>and for those of you that don't know the<br>Indian Premier League is a twenty20<br>cricket competition held in India where<br>the wages these guys are paid a pretty<br>high not as great as if you're playing<br>Premier League football in the UK but<br>these cricket is a very well-paid so for<br>the members of my household that would<br>really prefer to be at an Indian Premier<br>League event tonight than an inaugural<br>professorial lecture and that's probably<br>not just my sons but my brother the next<br>slide is for you one of the early admin<br>jobs I had in the Department of<br>Economics was that of social secretary<br>and I think it was around 1996 Martin<br>Richardson and I thought that an event<br>we could add to the social calendar was<br>a cricket match between the staff and<br>honours students and we've actually<br>played that suka throw probably played<br>in one of those games<br>nice to see you see that's been a<br>regular fixture on the departmental<br>calendar ever since the staff don't win<br>very often it has to be said now I've<br>searched high and low for some<br>photographic evidence of me actually<br>playing in one of these games and we've<br>got to go a long backhand way in time to<br>find it and you'll have to use your<br>imagination a wee bit here to appreciate<br>that it's a cricket match but I'll help<br>so an all-girl professorial lecture or<br>Indian Premier League I think that's the<br>1997 match which we also lost but as I<br>said I'll have to talk you through this<br>there's some cricket wickets there well<br>stumps there's someone holding a bet<br>John hell's would have been untiring<br>he's probably standing behind those<br>people here and you'll see someone lying<br>on the ground here clasping a ball that<br>they have just caught Sikma fractions of<br>a second before it hit the ground you've<br>probably guessed that was me I had to<br>run in from every time I told the story<br>is further away but I ran in from over<br>here somewhere dived and caught that<br>ball and I dropped an absolute certainty<br>year before which my colleagues had been<br>rubbing me about for a good year and I<br>shut them up by holding that catch but<br>we still lost the game right the slide<br>is my attempt to condense somewhere<br>between ten and fifteen years of<br>research into one slide before I get on<br>to the topic for tonight's lecture so<br>one of the key research questions I<br>looked at for a very long time was why<br>are some countries poorer than others<br>and thousands of economists have looked<br>at this question I don't want to give<br>the impression I've had a monopoly on<br>this idiot Adam Smith back in 1776 had<br>things to say on this but the sort of<br>method that I've used to look at these<br>questions is that of cross-country<br>regression equations controlling for the<br>effect of other variables and typically<br>controlling for dual causation don't<br>worry in the front row if you're not<br>sure what that means now in my PhD<br>thesis I was particularly focused on the<br>question of you know is low health a<br>possible explanation for a lack of<br>economic development and the focus was<br>on on both health and education and<br>their relationships with economic growth<br>and one of the things that we found was<br>that in countries where health levels<br>are lower those countries can expect to<br>have lower rates of economic growth and<br>be poorer and that's allowing for the<br>fact that causation might be flowing<br>back the other way as well from economic<br>growth into health but it's not my<br>intention to bore you with the details<br>I've put up there another bunch of<br>variables that I focus on and looked at<br>whether these might help explain why<br>countries attract at low levels of<br>income per capita and I've listed some<br>of those on the slide there and if<br>there's a little plus sign in<br>parentheses that means there's a<br>positive effect a negative sign<br>that there's a negative effect and a 0<br>means that statistically there's no<br>significant effect at all but I won't go<br>through the details of that you can<br>quickly look at it and then I'll push<br>the forward button on here so this is<br>the main thing I want to talk about<br>tonight the question of does charity<br>begin at home or overseas and the first<br>thing to point out is the word should<br>doesn't appear in the title there so my<br>main emphasis is not on the question of<br>should charity begin at home or overseas<br>but I'm focusing on the question of you<br>know what sorts of things the New<br>Zealanders donate to and what might some<br>of the reasons for that be but I am<br>going to spend a little bit of time<br>talking about the question of whether<br>charity should begin at home or overseas<br>because that's a useful way to motivate<br>what I want to talk about now according<br>to the effect of altruism movement<br>charity should begin overseas but why<br>and what do we mean by effective<br>altruism well an effective altruist is<br>someone who donates to charities that<br>will achieve the most for each dollar of<br>donations to put it more crudely we want<br>to get the best bang for our buck<br>what's one dollar going to achieve where<br>will it achieve the most and the notion<br>of effective altruism has been<br>popularized by Peter Singer a very<br>well-known Australian philosopher and<br>we'll McCaskill who will one day be a<br>very well-known philosopher he already<br>is but one day more say who studied at<br>the University of Oxford and both argue<br>that donations will achieve the most<br>good when they're directed to projects<br>particularly health projects and<br>developing countries where there's<br>plenty of low-hanging fruit left to pick<br>and what we mean by low hanging fruit is<br>low cost interventions with large<br>benefits and I'll give some examples on<br>the next slide but before I do that<br>here's some pictures of the books that<br>those guys have written so the first<br>couple by Peter Singer the third one the<br>one in orange by will McCaskill they're<br>all great books personally I prefer will<br>McCaskill's book probably because it's<br>got much more you can all mix in it than<br>the other two but it's a pretty good<br>reason to like a book I reckon now just<br>in case I get accused of plagiarism I<br>should acknowledge that<br>many of the points I'm about to make on<br>the next couple of slides I have taken<br>from well McCaskill's work so no this is<br>not my original research these are<br>things that he's argued so here's some<br>examples of low-hanging fruit firstly<br>evidence from randomized controlled<br>trials has shown that a thousand dollars<br>spent on distributing anti malaria bed<br>nets will lead to ten additional years<br>of life so that's about a hundred<br>dollars for each extra year of life and<br>how these bidding it's workers obviously<br>you catch malaria from mosquitoes and<br>they tend to bite people most when<br>they're asleep at night if you stick one<br>of these nets here which are pretty<br>cheap over someone's beard and they're<br>treated with insecticide that will<br>reduce the chances of them being bitten<br>by mosquitoes now of course not<br>everybody that has a net would have been<br>bitten by a mosquito anyway but the<br>research methodology that's used to come<br>up with these numbers takes that into<br>account but I won't go into those<br>details another example of low hanging<br>fruit has a thousand dollars spent on<br>deworming children and developing<br>countries that will lead to a hundred<br>and thirty nine years of additional<br>schooling as well as the obvious health<br>benefit so that sounds like money pretty<br>well spent - I did originally when I put<br>these slides together I had an image of<br>intestinal worms up there with the<br>malaria nets but I thought that probably<br>wasn't the best way to work up an<br>appetite for the free drinks and nibbles<br>at the staff club I would say I took it<br>down another example of low-hanging<br>fruit that I haven't put up there but<br>many of you will have heard of the Fred<br>Hollows foundation that's able to you<br>know operate on people's eyes and<br>restore people's eyesight at a pretty<br>low cost in developing countries and<br>that would be another example that I<br>could give us well so there are lots of<br>examples there of low-hanging fruit now<br>before I go any further I do have a<br>confession that I had better make and<br>that is I'm not really an effective old<br>trust myself my wife and I do donate<br>money to international development<br>charities but we donate plenty of local<br>charities as well that my wife works for<br>this amazing local charity who work with<br>people in the Dunedin area who've got<br>themselves into debt that they can't<br>hand<br>and try and get them out of that<br>situation and I'm very proud of the work<br>that she does right fuzz died and the<br>wall effect of old crust I might be<br>saying go work for World Vision or<br>something so I'm not necessarily an<br>effect of old Christ myself but I am<br>interested in the question of why don't<br>international development charities like<br>World Vision get a larger share of<br>charitable donations and they do but<br>before I go any further there is an<br>elephant in the room here that needs to<br>be addressed and that is the question of<br>does aid really work because I'm sure<br>you've all heard it argued before that<br>it doesn't and someone who's argued this<br>quite famously as dambisa Moyo she's<br>argued that Africa's received one<br>trillion dollars in aid with very little<br>to show for it<br>and there's a couple of things I've put<br>in red there and I'm going to try and<br>debunk both of them so the first thing I<br>want to talk about is with a 1 trillion<br>dollars is really a lot of money or not<br>I mean it clearly is but I'm going to<br>put that number in context and then look<br>at the question of whether there's<br>little to show for it here's a picture<br>of her book you've probably gathered by<br>now I like reading books and showing<br>people images of good books that I've<br>read but firstly let's talk about how<br>much money a trillion dollars really is<br>if we spread that over 60 years because<br>Moyo was making the point that over 60<br>years it's one trillion dollars that's<br>been spent and if we take into account<br>that in that time in Africa there's been<br>four hundred and twelve million people<br>alive on average then that actually<br>works out at only 40 dollars per year<br>per person so it's not actually very<br>much money at all an effective old press<br>would point out that $40 should be able<br>to achieve something but we wouldn't<br>necessarily expect it to solve all of<br>Africa's problems it's actually quite a<br>small amount of money per capita per<br>animal but the other point tonight is<br>that it's not that nothing's been<br>achieved in India at all that's a serene<br>Afric hurdle that's simply not correct<br>and 19:50 life expectancy in Africa was<br>thirty six point seven years it's now 56<br>years that's a big gain<br>foreign aid hasn't necessarily achieved<br>all that but it's got to be part of the<br>story and to give a more specific<br>example smallpox was eradicated in 1977<br>and large part due to foreign aid if<br>it's particularly<br>by the world health organization prior<br>to its eradication it caused one and a<br>half to three million deaths per year<br>they are now deaths that are not<br>happening largely due to foreign aid so<br>the money is actually being quite small<br>and it's actually achieved quite a lot<br>right how generous are New Zealanders<br>well there's an outfit called the world<br>giving sorry there's a survey called the<br>world giving survey that comes out each<br>year and according to that survey New<br>Zealanders are amongst the most generous<br>people in the world we were fourth place<br>in 2017 the 2018 results aren't out yet<br>now some of you are probably sitting<br>there thinking I wonder where Australia<br>got did we be Australian<br>Australia was sixth so yes we did beat<br>them so New Zealanders are a generous<br>Bunch but what sorts of things do we<br>give to well there's some numbers these<br>are not my data I've given the source<br>there but I've highlighted the key<br>number and red money that New Zealanders<br>give to international aid or<br>International Development is eight point<br>seven percent of the total or at least<br>it was in 2014 and it's similar other<br>years this is not money given by the<br>government it's money given by people<br>like you and me but on average New<br>Zealanders have a clear preference for<br>giving money to things other than<br>International Development so what I'm<br>interested in is well why is that figure<br>so low so I'm now going to talk about a<br>couple of research projects I've worked<br>on with some different co-workers to<br>look at this and the first one I want to<br>talk about I will call the number of<br>charities effect and this is joint work<br>with treaty Sullivan that was published<br>last year and that's a photo of treaty<br>obviously she's not looking very happy<br>that oh that's a nice photo it's better<br>than the one I put up of me anyway<br>before we get any further - just one<br>thing to add so this paper was published<br>as Knowles and Sullivan and I know some<br>of you work in academic disciplines<br>where you probably argue for months over<br>whose name goes first and you all fall<br>out with each other we have a very<br>simple solution and economics to this<br>problem we go in alphabetical order the<br>rest of you might want to think about<br>doing that and this is a really good<br>reason to do otherwise we stick with<br>for medical ordering so that's why I'm<br>first not because I did all the work<br>this was genuinely a joint effort<br>between Trudy and I so we know that less<br>than 10 percent of donations go to<br>international development charities but<br>perhaps this is because there are a lot<br>more domestic charities to give to<br>there's not actually that many<br>International Development charities in<br>New Zealand if we started to name them<br>we think of World Vision Oxfam Save the<br>Children for example who work I think<br>both domestically and internationally<br>there's not that many but there are<br>thousands of charities that help people<br>in need in New Zealand and it could well<br>be that if there are at least some<br>people who give a small amount of money<br>to every charity that asks them or if<br>people were to decide at random which<br>charities they give money to you we<br>might expect that International<br>Development might not get a big chunk of<br>that because there's fewer International<br>Development charities so in our research<br>we tried to control for that number of<br>charities effect and our method was a<br>field experiment and I've explained what<br>a field experiment is by giving you an<br>example so what we did was letters were<br>synced participants inviting them to<br>complete a survey on charitable giving<br>and saying that ten dollars would be<br>donated to charity if they completed our<br>survey the money didn't come from me and<br>truly it came from a research account<br>that I had so it was kind of university<br>money and actually another thing we did<br>in this research project was we varied<br>the length of time we gave people to<br>respond so some people we said we've<br>made the donation of fate denied yeah<br>did the survey within a week others were<br>given a month and others there was no<br>time on it somewhat surprisingly we got<br>the highest response rate when there was<br>no time limit mentioned and the lowest<br>response rate when we gave a one month<br>deadline so if there's anyone here who's<br>involved in determining what time limit<br>we should have for our online teaching<br>evaluations I might want to have a chat<br>with you sometime anyway back to what<br>this was really about participants can<br>choose if the ten dollars went to World<br>Vision or the Salvation Army and these<br>charities are very similar and most<br>respects they're both faith based<br>they're both large they're both<br>well-known the key difference is that<br>one assists families and<br>in poor countries overseas the other<br>assists families in need in New Zealand<br>and by limiting the choice to only to<br>charities we control for that number of<br>charities effect so we're interested in<br>did world vision get more than eight<br>point seven percent well they did but it<br>was quite a lot less than 50 percent<br>here are the results twenty eight point<br>four percent of participants chose for<br>the a donation to go to World Vision and<br>that's obviously much higher than the<br>eight point seven percent of personal<br>donations that go to International<br>Development each year and that is<br>consistent with the being a number of<br>charities effect but the other thing we<br>did in this project was we invited<br>people to give a reason if they wanted<br>for choosing the charity that they had<br>and of the two hundred and fifteen<br>people who completed the survey a<br>hundred and thirty three gave us a<br>reason for why they chosen either the<br>Salvation Army or World Vision so we now<br>have a very quick look at those results<br>so here's the reasons given for donating<br>to the Salvation Army and you can see<br>that 52 percent of people thought said<br>something along the lines of charity<br>begins at home so this was a free-form<br>thing they could write what they wanted<br>and we categorized people's responses<br>under different headings there were 31<br>percent who said well we we're going to<br>give to world that's all we're gonna<br>give to the Salvation Army either<br>because we've done so before or we know<br>someone who works for them or you know<br>we know someone who's been helped by<br>them and we lumped all those responses<br>together into Salvation Army recognition<br>nine percent Civil War donated to World<br>Vision before so would like this money<br>to go to the Salvation Army now none of<br>those people was suggesting in any way<br>they'd been unhappy with what World<br>Vision had done with the money it's just<br>that they want to share it around<br>we had expected that maybe quite a lot<br>of people what expressed concerns about<br>well if we send the money overseas will<br>it get to those really in need and only<br>six percent of people said something<br>along those names so that was actually<br>quite a small number here are the<br>reasons given for donating to World<br>Vision fifty-three percent said<br>something along the lines of this<br>greater need overseas interestingly not<br>a single person said something that we'd<br>expect an effective ultra to say which<br>is we'll get more<br>my donation if it goes overseas but<br>commenting on the being greater need<br>overseas is a pretty closely related<br>concept though 24 percent who were<br>giving to World Vision because they'd<br>had something to do with them before<br>maybe they've done the World Vision<br>40-hour famine or something we've you<br>know donated to them or know someone who<br>works for them interestingly 10 percent<br>pick World Vision because the Salvation<br>Army they see it was too religious and<br>that's interesting because they're both<br>faith-based charities but perhaps they<br>didn't know world vision was faith-based<br>or maybe they perceive them to be less<br>religious so that's the first project I<br>want to talk about the second one we'll<br>call in search of effective altruists<br>and this is joint work with MARAC inch<br>and again treaty sullivan but we've seen<br>treaties photo before so i'm not putting<br>it up again but there's marette so<br>moretz the other member of this team now<br>i should acknowledge that even though<br>i've put it 2018 date omnia this is very<br>much research and progress i remember<br>Richard saying at his IPL last year that<br>you know he's very wary of people saying<br>that something's almost finished but<br>really Richard this almost is it's it's<br>finished enough that I can tell you<br>about some of the key results so in this<br>paper we argue that maybe or we<br>hypothesize really that there could be<br>two reasons why people may prefer giving<br>to domestic charities the first one is<br>they may simply prefer to give to people<br>living in New Zealand rather than to<br>people further away this is the chair<br>sort of charity begins at home type<br>argument or it could be that maybe<br>people are not aware that a donation<br>will be more effective when targeted to<br>helping poor people overseas maybe<br>they've never heard of that before maybe<br>they have but they don't believe it so<br>how do we test for this well we tested<br>for the first hypothesis by conducting a<br>discrete choice experiment using a<br>thousand minds to determine what weights<br>people place on the following things<br>firstly where the donation is spent so<br>as it spent in New Zealand or a country<br>close to New Zealand or a country far<br>away also how needy the recipient is and<br>third how effective that a nation will<br>be the way we tested for our second<br>hypothesis was extremely straightforward<br>really we simply asked them<br>and the survey if they thought of<br>donation would be more effective in New<br>Zealand or in a poor country overseas<br>and you might want to think about what<br>proportions of people you think might<br>pick New Zealand and might pick the poor<br>country overseas and I'll get to that<br>scene those of you that my colleague and<br>friend Paul Henson's IPL four weeks ago<br>know all about a thousand minds but you<br>weren't all here or there rather so I'll<br>go very quickly over how that works so<br>basically in a thousand minds people<br>make a series of peer wise choices like<br>the one of God on the screen here and<br>this is where I do need to find the<br>mouse so people are asked for example<br>which are the two hypothetical charities<br>would you prefer to donate to this one<br>over here where the need of the<br>recipients is medium and the expected<br>benefit to the recipients for $100<br>donation is high or would you rather it<br>go to this country where the need of the<br>recipients is high but the expected<br>benefit is low now if you are someone<br>who is more interested in need of the<br>recipients you'd probably pick this one<br>or if you're more interested in what the<br>donation could achieve you would pick<br>that one you having answered that<br>question the software would then<br>randomly give you another question to<br>answer and it might be this one here<br>we're in this case we've got one charity<br>where the need of the recipients is low<br>but the donation will be spent in New<br>Zealand here the NIDA recipients is high<br>but the donation will be used in a<br>country close to New Zealand for example<br>in the Pacific region and you might want<br>to think about which of those you pick<br>now in our experiment here once people<br>have been through about a dozen choices<br>the software through using transitivity<br>to minimize the number of choices but<br>also using linear programming is able to<br>work out for each person what percentage<br>weight they put on each of those three<br>attributes I mentioned earlier and here<br>are the results now I realize this is a<br>bit to take in but the key numbers to<br>focus on here the numbers are in bold so<br>on average across the thousand plus<br>people that did our survey the weight<br>that they put on where the donation will<br>be used was thirty six point four<br>percent that's higher than the weight on<br>the other attributes expected benefit<br>was 31<br>when three and the need of the<br>recipients was 32.3 so these are<br>obviously very similar but the highest<br>weight was placed on where the donation<br>would be used another way to think about<br>these results is to look at the<br>percentages of participants for whom<br>each attribute was the most important so<br>where the donation will be used was<br>important for 51.7% of people the one<br>I've put and reared as those that we<br>might think might be effective all<br>trusts expected benefit to recipients<br>that was the most important attribute<br>only for 23.6% of participants and the<br>need of recipients was pretty close to<br>we then zeroed in on do people think<br>donations and more effective and poor<br>countries overseas and the wording of<br>the question that was put to them is on<br>the screen there I won't read it but I<br>just think for a few seconds about what<br>you think the results might look like<br>and we were pretty surprised by these so<br>about as many people thought that<br>intonation would do the most good in New<br>Zealand s thought it would do the most<br>good overseas and there was eleven point<br>six percent who were not sure we thought<br>to be quite a few people who thought<br>that the donation would do the most got<br>in New Zealand but not that many and<br>interestingly of those that chose to<br>give us a reason for their answer the<br>most common reason for choosing New<br>Zealand was that charity begins at home<br>no no that's not actually answering the<br>question we are asking why do you think<br>a dollar will go further in New Zealand<br>our charity begins at home and what that<br>suggests is perhaps these participants<br>and I'm not making a judgement here I'm<br>just reporting on what they said perhaps<br>for them it's so important that charity<br>begins at home that their influence is<br>how they think about where a donation<br>will do the most good now the other<br>thing we did which we did in our<br>previous paper that I talked about was<br>we sent participants that we've got a<br>couple of thousand dollars from a<br>university of research grant the<br>professor Blakey<br>we didn't tell them that you generously<br>get you know what I mean Richard we said<br>we've got some money in a research grant<br>account two thousand dollars we're going<br>to give some to World Vision and some to<br>the Salvation Army you<br>tell us you vote as to who should get<br>the money and that was given out in<br>those proportions so of the 269 people<br>who placed most weight on the<br>effectiveness of a donation we're<br>interested in how many of them thought<br>of donation would do the most good in a<br>poor country overseas and then I'll get<br>to the importance of the point I just<br>made so there are a hundred and sixty<br>eight people who thought both that a<br>donation would do the most good in New<br>Zealand and how much good at donation<br>would do was the most important<br>attribute to them now of those people<br>how many of them wanted us to give the<br>money to World Vision and note that<br>hundred and sixty-eight are the people<br>that we might expect to be effective old<br>trusts and choose World Vision 67 did<br>now it's a bit of a mystery but one<br>possible explanation could be and again<br>Paul talked about this and his talk a<br>few weeks ago when talking about some of<br>the research he'd done now people have<br>different ways of making decisions<br>some people objectively look at criteria<br>and think which criteria are important<br>to me and how does this map to my<br>decision other people go with your gut<br>instinct and what we're finding here is<br>a lot of people going with your gut<br>instinct making a different decision to<br>what we would expect them to have done<br>so to summarize on this particular<br>project there's evidence for both our<br>hypotheses firstly many people attach<br>more weight to where the money is spent<br>then on the effectiveness of a donation<br>secondly many people think a donation<br>will be more effectively spent in New<br>Zealand<br>and all these people their thoughts on<br>where a donation will be more effective<br>is kind of influenced by where they'd<br>prefer the money to be spent so those<br>are the two projects that very directly<br>relate to the question of does charity<br>begin at home or overseas what I'm going<br>to talk about for the remaining time I<br>have we're getting towards Ian guys<br>don't worry I'm talking to my children<br>when I say that a lot of the research<br>that I've done over the last seven to<br>eight years as was noted earlier is<br>using laboratory experiments to analyze<br>hypotheses relating to charitable giving<br>and I've picked a couple of my favorites<br>to talk<br>but they're also ones that relate to the<br>general theme of tonight's talk so the<br>first one is on the topic of the<br>deserving poor and this is joint work<br>with David fielding and Alvin airtime<br>and here's a photo here of the three<br>authors you can probably work out who's<br>who so that's me<br>that's David and that's Alvin and Alvin<br>was a PhD student in our department off<br>10 years or so ago who was supervised by<br>David and 9 he was a truly really great<br>PhD student and he did some fantastic<br>work when he'd finished his PhD he got a<br>postdoc in our department for a year<br>working under mine and David's<br>supervision and it was during that<br>postdoc year that we worked on the<br>project I'm going to tell you about when<br>he finished here he got a postdoc at<br>Yale over in the US and he's now working<br>at the World Bank so David and I are<br>both very proud of what Elven has<br>achieved but the research question we<br>were looking at in this project is are<br>people more likely to donate to an<br>International Development charity when<br>told the people who will be helped by<br>their donation app or for reasons beyond<br>their control and the method we used for<br>this was a lab experiment and again the<br>best way to tell you what a lab<br>experiment is is just to give you the<br>example from the study so here's what we<br>did we recruited participants to take<br>part in a survey and we paid them $20 to<br>do our survey I can't even remember now<br>what the survey was on and that's not<br>actually important when we paid them<br>they got their money in an envelope but<br>it wasn't a $20 night it was a $10 night<br>a $5 night to $2 coins and a $1 coin I<br>can see my children checking that they<br>added up to 20 did I get it right<br>good thanks every right so they did that<br>and then we asked them so they did the<br>survey and we then asked them if they'd<br>like to donate their pain any of their<br>payment to World Vision who would spend<br>the money in two different African<br>countries and we provided the following<br>information about those two countries we<br>didn't tell them the name of the<br>countries and that was quite deliberate<br>because if we'd said it was you know<br>Nigeria they might know something about<br>Nigeria other than the information we<br>wanted to present that might have<br>influenced their decision<br>so we told them that in both countries<br>income per person is less than $3 per<br>dieter's that's factually correct<br>we then told them about country a-and<br>I'll call that the global warming<br>country but we didn't use that name and<br>the information we gave them the<br>information we gave them as in quote<br>marks there so he told them that one<br>reason given for low incomes in this<br>country is that the country is<br>increasingly subject to drought as a<br>result of global warming caused by<br>greenhouse gas emissions in other parts<br>of the world and then we provided some<br>data on that and that information is all<br>correct<br>I can cease Harleen waiting to see if we<br>deceive them at any point because<br>psychologists sometimes do that no we<br>didn't because we economists don't<br>country B that's what we call it what to<br>them but I'll call it the large family<br>country and we told them that one reason<br>given for low incomes in this country is<br>that people in this country choose to<br>have large families and the average<br>number of children born per woman in<br>this country is 6.3 one of the highest<br>in the world the point I'm about to make<br>now is the point that I've really<br>drummed them to myself of late I have to<br>remember to say because this is really<br>important neither David Elva nor I<br>believe that the reason people in that<br>country are poor is because they've got<br>lots of children causation works the<br>other way around they have lots of<br>children because they're poor but a<br>quick search of the internet would<br>reveal plenty of people making arguments<br>like this that people in Africa are poor<br>cuz they just have too many kids so when<br>we said that one reason given for low<br>incomes you know that's true we didn't<br>believe it but it is a reason that's<br>given so remember what we invited people<br>to do here was give some of their twenty<br>dollars to World Vision who would spend<br>it in one of these two countries and the<br>participants could choose how much if<br>any to give to country a and how much to<br>give to country B so they could give to<br>neither one of them or both the results<br>were kind of interesting so the average<br>donations to the global warming country<br>was two dollars fifty for an average<br>donations to the large family country<br>was a dollar seventy four so it's a<br>reasonably big difference<br>it's also statistically significant so<br>what this suggests is that you know when<br>people believe that people are poor for<br>reasons beyond their own control they're<br>going to be more generous in the<br>charitable donations that they make to<br>them this is the final research project<br>that I'm going to talk about tonight and<br>we'll call this the power of asking and<br>this is joint work that I did again with<br>David fielding who's sitting in the<br>front row up here and the research<br>question was this how much more likely<br>are people to donate to charity if they<br>are verbally asked than if they simply<br>see a donation box sitting there but no<br>one asks them to put money in it now the<br>7:00 sharp<br>TV program a couple of weeks ago very<br>helpfully motivated this paper for me we<br>obviously didn't know this when we did<br>the research but they were talking about<br>the fair hey wouldn't it be great if<br>charities yeah<br>weren't so in-your-face about asking for<br>money and just waited for people to come<br>to them and give them money what the<br>results of our research will show is<br>that charities would probably get quite<br>a lot less money if they did things that<br>way so that's the research question and<br>here's how we did it so we had two<br>different treatments that's different<br>you know things happening in different<br>research sessions and in both treatments<br>participants were paid $19 for<br>completing a survey you can see we've<br>got a bit stingy about what we were<br>paying people for these things $20 is<br>our standard amount actually I'm David<br>and I might have to try and remember why<br>we did 19 this time around there was a<br>reason but I can't remember so we<br>invited people to come and do our survey<br>they came to the room with us was<br>happening they completed the survey and<br>we asked them to put the completed<br>survey in an envelope and they were<br>sitting at a table well separated from<br>other people no one else could see the<br>answers they were giving to the survey<br>but again the survey was kind of<br>incidental here to what we're doing we<br>then asked them to place this envelope<br>in a red box and the room next door as<br>they left one at a time so they knew<br>that they were going to leave the room<br>put the envelope with your completed<br>survey Anna and the bread box in the<br>room next door but how things went<br>between the two different treatments now<br>differs so in the standard treatment or<br>the verbal solicitation participants<br>were verbally invited to donate<br>part or all of their payment to World<br>Vision so and it's a standard way of<br>doing things in these experiments and<br>the way that they would have do this was<br>that if they wish to donate they were to<br>once they were in the other room next<br>door where they went one at a time so no<br>one could see what they were doing they<br>should put the a donation in the<br>envelope that had this survey in it<br>before placing their envelope in the red<br>box so the envelope contains their<br>completed survey and their donation but<br>no names or ID numbers are gone on the<br>survey we don't know who made which<br>decisions here's what the Reid survey<br>box looked like in the room next door<br>you can see I made that with a<br>photocopying box and some red paper and<br>sellotape we didn't waste money on that<br>and here's a close up just showing a<br>little bit of advertising from World<br>Vision on top of the box and for those<br>of you that are familiar with the Otago<br>business school building or the<br>communist building as we called it back<br>in those days this project was done in<br>the boardroom which is two adjoining<br>rooms and to get out of the inner room<br>where people get the survey they've got<br>to go through the other room and the<br>donation box treatment on the other hand<br>participants were not verbally asked to<br>give any money we never said to them hey<br>do you want to donate<br>instead what we did was a donation box<br>was placed on the table beside the red<br>box so they'd come through to the other<br>room expecting to put their completed<br>survey and that red box there they could<br>not fail to see this donation box<br>sitting next to it and see that it had<br>some money in it so it was obvious that<br>this is a very subtle opportunity to<br>give money to charity but it wasn't an<br>ileus you know it's in your face if you<br>like it's the verbal solicitation if you<br>look very closely you can see some wire<br>there attached to that box and the end<br>of it you can't see is attached to the<br>leg of that table so when people were in<br>this room putting their surveys in the<br>red box and possibly putting money in<br>the donation box there we know what<br>anyone else could see what they were<br>doing so we were worried that the box<br>might get stolen and our biggest concern<br>was not so much that the money would<br>disappear but our data was disappearing<br>effectively in that box so we were<br>pretty security conscious of<br>I mean if someone had brought wire<br>cutters with them they'd have been able<br>to make it but you know why would they<br>have now here's where this research<br>project got interesting how do we<br>recover the distribution of donations<br>while protecting anonymity for the<br>people who were just putting their money<br>in the donation box and what I mean by<br>that is this and let's consider an<br>example that I've got on the slide here<br>we had 16 people per session but imagine<br>there were only two and here's the money<br>that one participant was given and<br>here's the money that another one was<br>given if we were to find 19 dollars in<br>the donation box<br>we need more information than that we<br>need to know if one person gave 15 and<br>the other four or if one gave 10 and one<br>gave 9 so how on earth were we going to<br>sort this out and this was actually the<br>hardest better--this research project we<br>thought long and hard about this and<br>then it dawned on one of us I think it<br>might have been David are the Knights<br>they've got serial numbers on them for<br>the $10.00 night there and the $5 ninth<br>year so as we were stuffing the the<br>money into envelopes I was making a<br>night David was doing something else I<br>was making a note of the serial numbers<br>on the notes so if we found these two<br>notes in the donation box we knew the<br>same person and given them but the coins<br>were much harder because they don't have<br>serial numbers on them so we thought<br>even longer and even harder about this<br>and I think this time again it was David<br>who came up with the solution or part of<br>the solution which is the coins don't<br>have serial numbers on them they do the<br>however have dates and the coins that<br>are currently in use in New Zealand have<br>been around since 1990 problem solved<br>actually it wasn't because coins are not<br>issued in New Zealand every year and<br>when we did our research on this in<br>other words when we went into Google and<br>typed in New Zealand two-dollar coin we<br>discovered that the aura at the time we<br>did this anyway they've been 11<br>different years that two-dollar coins<br>had been issued and nine different years<br>that $1 coins had been issued but it was<br>even worse there are some years that<br>coins have been issued that not very<br>many of them have been issued<br>1997 is a real year for two-dollar coins<br>if you ever<br>one hold on to it might become valuable<br>one day so we didn't really have enough<br>degrees of freedom here the solution<br>that we came up with and actually one<br>thing we thought of doing was marking<br>the coins with invisible ink<br>but the reason we didn't do there is we<br>were pretty sure that that would count<br>as defacing not debasing but defacing<br>the currency which we thought might be<br>illegal so we were worried about that<br>but more importantly we were worried<br>about the fact that a journal editor if<br>they thought was anything dodgy they<br>might reject our paper so instead what<br>we did was this and this was David's<br>idea to I think although it was me that<br>implemented it I got a tenebrous a and<br>an old shirt that I'd finished with and<br>polished either one or both sides of<br>each of these coins so for the 1990<br>coins for example some of them were<br>polished on the head side some on the<br>tail side some on both what we did with<br>the one dollar coins was more<br>complicated I don't have time to go into<br>it so I whined anyway I did this at home<br>in the evenings David suggested getting<br>a research assistant but we're worried<br>about the health and safety issues<br>around brazo inhalation so I did it my<br>wife didn't particularly like the smell<br>so I did it at home in the evenings<br>while watching TV on even she was out<br>with the windows open and I spent tens<br>and tens of hours doing this about<br>halfway through David did ask if he<br>could help but I was enjoying it so much<br>by that stage I carried on anyway here<br>are the results<br>donations were 50 times higher when<br>people were verbally asked there was<br>only three dollars put in that donation<br>box out of 64 people and the donation<br>box treatment a $2 coin and a $1 coin<br>here's the really annoying fact they<br>were put in the Box in different<br>sessions I need not have polished the<br>coins now when I say here donations were<br>50 times higher that what we do have to<br>admit here is that we had to redo these<br>experiments a year or so later because<br>we sent the paper off to a journal and a<br>referee said hey this is a great paper<br>but I think you've got a confound in<br>your design we beg to differ but hey we<br>had to redo the experiment take<br>into account the point this referee had<br>made and I had to polish all of those<br>coins again because we'd given them to<br>people as payment so we had to do it all<br>again when we did it the second time<br>around we've got a bit more money in the<br>donation box was about 23 or 24 dollars<br>so donations were six times higher with<br>the verbal ask that time but there was<br>one person who put the whole 19 dollars<br>in the donation box and the difference<br>across the two experiments can be<br>explained by that one person's behavior<br>again I needn't polish the coins there<br>was only one person per session in that<br>particular treatment who had actually<br>given any money so the coin polishing<br>both times was all a complete waste of<br>time and actually one thing I've noticed<br>we had a few of them left over and after<br>a few weeks I noticed that these coins<br>started to go slightly green because I<br>hadn't probably rubbed off every last<br>bit of brass oh and occasionally when I<br>get changed from a shot there's a slight<br>green tinge to the corners and I wonder<br>if I'm getting one of my old coins back<br>from that experiment so to summarise on<br>what I've talked about tonight<br>according to effect of Old Crow era tea<br>should begin overseas but most people<br>are not effective oak crusts and by the<br>way I've talked a lot about New Zealand<br>data but this is true of other countries<br>as well a figure of about 10% of<br>donations going to international<br>development in developed countries is<br>about normal New Zealand is not an<br>outlier here so most people aren't<br>effective old crusts and some possible<br>explanations for that that we've looked<br>at and found some evidence for is that<br>most people place more weight on where<br>the donation goes rather than how<br>effective it will be also many people<br>are not aware or don't believe that a<br>donation will achieve more of spent in a<br>poor country overseas another possible<br>reason International Development<br>charities get a small share of total<br>donations in New Zealand is because<br>there's only a small number of them<br>people are more likely to give to<br>International Development charities if<br>they think people are poor for reasons<br>beyond their control and the power of<br>asking effect is large now I come to<br>what is really my last slide there's<br>some acknowledgments that I want to make<br>here firstly to all of my<br>colleagues in the Department of<br>Economics both past and present this was<br>alluded to in the introductory comments<br>that Harleen and Robin both made<br>economics department at the University<br>of Otago is a truly wonderful place most<br>of the time to work and you know I've<br>had a great bunch of colleagues for the<br>many years that I've worked there most<br>of the time I look forward to coming<br>into work in the morning so thank you to<br>all of you you know we work pretty hard<br>but it's a fun place to work too<br>secondly to all my co-authors I've<br>mentioned some of you tonight you know<br>with respect to different research<br>projects but there are many many other<br>great co-authors that I've worked with<br>and I actually thought of listing all of<br>my co-authors and all of my current and<br>past colleagues but we'd be here all<br>night if I did that say I haven't to the<br>postgraduate students I've supervised<br>you've all been great I mentioned Alvin<br>but there have been some other fantastic<br>post grades I've supervised as well so<br>thank you for all the hard work that you<br>guys have done and also the<br>undergraduate students that I've taught<br>over the years I love teaching<br>first second third year classes fourth<br>year as well but for me the more<br>students in a classroom the more fun the<br>experience of standing up the front is<br>and I truly love that part of the job<br>and I think it would be fair to say that<br>not all of the students I've taught have<br>been brilliant but many many of them<br>have we have some truly wonderful<br>undergraduate students come through the<br>University of Otago and it's a privilege<br>to teach them and I love getting emails<br>from past undergrad students telling me<br>about what they're up to I got one from<br>a former student just last week telling<br>me that she had this internship at the<br>United Nations and about having met our<br>Prime Minister and her baby and partner<br>and her role at the UN and how she got<br>to sit in on all these big meetings at<br>the UN so that New Zealand could be<br>represented there and you know we've got<br>many many students like that I also like<br>to acknowledge my wonderful wife and<br>children and I've got a picture here of<br>you guys this is from a few years ago<br>we're all looking a little bit younger<br>than the children especially but to Joe<br>Abbey Samuel and Joshua I love you guys<br>very much<br>and works obviously important but you<br>guys are much more important and if ever<br>I've got that balance round the wrong<br>way then I apologize and finally to my<br>wonderful mum and dad for always<br>encouraging me to achieve the best that<br>I could be that at school or it's sport<br>or at university or whatever whatever I<br>was doing thank you for encouraging me<br>to come to University in the first place<br>financially supporting me through that<br>and encouraging me to carry on with<br>post-grad study I do have a photo of mum<br>and dad here it's a few years old taken<br>at the occasion of Jays 40th birthday so<br>some of you will be able to work out how<br>old that photo is and it's been a true<br>blessing to have my mum here this<br>evening<br>my dad sadly passed away a few years ago<br>but I reckon he would have really<br>enjoyed being here tonight and I'd like<br>to dedicate this talk to his memory and<br>that's up from me<br>tena koutou tena koutou tena koe Takata<br>my name is David fielding I'm deputy<br>dean in the school of business I'm also<br>one of Stephens colleagues as most of<br>you already know in the Department of<br>Economics and I'm really really pleased<br>to be able to do the wrapping up talk<br>and to make the presentation I think we<br>do oh yes we do we have a present here<br>so I I'll talk about that in a minute<br>it's a real pleasure for two too many<br>reasons the first reason is I think I<br>first met Stephen in 2001 when he was in<br>on sabbatical in the UK and I'm from the<br>UK and it was meeting Stephen that first<br>gave me the idea to come to the<br>University of Otago so he's one of the<br>main reasons why I'm here so you have<br>him to thank that for but the the other<br>main reason is so I can say on behalf of<br>the department of economics had a truly<br>privileged we are to have Stephen as a<br>colleague<br>he's just the most amazing guy I mean he<br>talked about the the wonderful<br>department that he works in to a large<br>extent lacks his creation through very<br>many years he's one of the longest<br>standing members of the department he's<br>been head of department had a number of<br>roles in the department he truly is the<br>best of citizens of course he's an<br>excellent researcher world-class<br>researcher publishing in the top<br>journals in the field and I knew seen<br>some of that research tonight<br>he's one of our best teachers is pretty<br>much every year he's been working in the<br>department he's taught 38 economics for<br>at least for as long as I can convention<br>and he gets that the best possible<br>teaching evaluations imaginable I don't<br>know how he does it<br>we'd certainly clone him too if we could<br>and he's just this a wonderful role<br>model to junior faculty in the<br>department to the PhD students he really<br>is an excellent model of how to be an<br>academic in many ways<br>not your your stereotypical economist<br>who's not motivated by money who's not<br>motivated by profit<br>he's multivalued by some very deeply<br>held values I'm coming in part from his<br>personal faith and just from a desire to<br>make the world a better price through<br>academic research and that's really what<br>the University of Otago is about it's<br>also what the Department of Economics is<br>about he has mentioned one of our one or<br>two of our practice I I I'm I know I'm<br>keeping you from the drinks but I just I<br>I ought to mention this as an example of<br>how tolerant and and and and kind a<br>person<br>Steven is we did have one other problem<br>with with the experiment he just talked<br>about which is as these participants<br>were going one by one out of the room to<br>put the money in the box we didn't want<br>the coins to make any noise because we<br>didn't want that one the participants<br>who were still in the room to hear what<br>was happening outside so we had the idea<br>that we should play music inside the<br>room while this was happening and I said<br>hey Steven I got this great idea we can<br>play back all the time that the the<br>experiment is happening because that's a<br>very it was it was some of you know box<br>three-part inventions it's music played<br>on the piano it's very level in volume<br>so that's going to work quite well isn't<br>it now Steven is not a fan of Baroque<br>music but he agreed to do this I think<br>he even bought the copy of the music<br>himself yeah yeah yeah he paid for it<br>and as it turned out he was the one<br>sitting sitting in the room all the time<br>while the music was playing when I was<br>outside I never afraid I put him off<br>back for life but he that that's just an<br>example of how tolerant and giving he is<br>and I am sorry about the Brussels so Joe<br>I'm sorry about the brass so it won't<br>happen again<br>so now is the point when I should not<br>forget first of all to welcome you all<br>to the staff club for drinks and<br>refreshments afterwards and if<br>seconds but I also have to remember to<br>make the presentation so once again on<br>behalf of us all could you please thank<br>Steven for an excellent talk</p></main><footer
