come and talk today a<br>topic I've chosen is to talk about type<br>1 diabetes specifically and some of our<br>work and other work on technology and<br>specifically this crossover now between<br>glucose monitoring and also insulin<br>delivery and we've got a really nice<br>collaboration that we've built you know<br>across the DSM through the University<br>and other centers scenario we're really<br>passionate about and and I think at the<br>moment while we await a cure which has<br>sort of been promised every 10 years<br>since certainly I've been doing diabetes<br>but I think since about 1920 that's been<br>promised so so I think in the meantime<br>technology is definitely what is going<br>to improve people's lives with diabetes<br>and it's going to slip into that void<br>while we await a more definitive answer<br>and so so I'll talk a little bit about<br>type 1 a little bit about history and<br>then talk about why we think we because<br>monitoring is so important and why that<br>links then and to how we move into<br>insulin delivery and then we'll talk<br>about our studies that we're doing now I<br>mean that we have planned but also a<br>little touch on where things might be<br>heading in the future and then clearly<br>again this is the area where things will<br>really improve people with type 1<br>diabetes so just to remind you what type<br>1 diabetes is that this is these are two<br>different children just around the time<br>that insulin was discovered they were<br>both undergoing starvation therapy in an<br>institution which was the only way you<br>could keep children alive for a short<br>period of time when they develop type 1<br>diabetes and of course they went on very<br>low-calorie diets they wasted away you<br>could keep them from much sooner death<br>from acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis<br>by doing this but this is how they<br>appeared and then just so just sitting<br>that scene and then giving you a bit of<br>a link to some of the people who were<br>instrumental and changing that for those<br>children so first gentleman was<br>from Austria Oscar Mankowski and and him<br>and others worked and Strasburg and they<br>were working with dogs and that he<br>infected all the surgical operations<br>where they removed the pancreas of these<br>dogs and discovered the link between<br>removing the pancreas and the dog's<br>developing diabetes and they weren't<br>able to take it any further<br>but others built on their work and the<br>collide police go he was a Romanian he<br>was working in the Syria just before and<br>just at the very beginning of World War<br>one and he almost discovered insulin so<br>there's a movement occasionally to<br>recognize him for maybe discovering<br>insulin he certainly did document<br>improvements and the dogs that he had<br>removed the pancreas as of and then he<br>would sue the pancreas is up and give<br>that extract back to them and they were<br>and there were some small improvements<br>and glucose levels that he documented<br>and his early papers but then he was<br>interrupted by the war and he never was<br>able to realize the work that he had<br>come very close to doing he was also a<br>young it's a very terrible sort of<br>political and social views which<br>probably made him this popular for<br>giving Nobel Prizes to them these as<br>well Friedrich Ellen the extremely<br>severe guy in the bottom as you might<br>imagine looking at his face he was the<br>father of the starvation diet and and<br>it's in the until the discovery of<br>insulin his method was the only way to<br>keep anybody alive who developed type 1<br>but only for a short period of time and<br>then this is a frederick banting<br>there we go frederick painting and beast<br>and one of their dogs that that really<br>the deal work was what how we discovered<br>insulin they I guess the dog is there<br>they they also were using dogs for their<br>research so they would remove the<br>pancreas of the dogs but prior to that<br>they would like eat all the pancreatic<br>ducts and that was how they jumped<br>forward from everyone else so they got<br>rid of all the exocrine aspects of the<br>pancreas through sort of Auto digestion<br>before they took that next step and then<br>they would<br>Stewart the pancreas is after that and<br>they would end up with this insulin like<br>extract as to that that was their work<br>wasn't a good time to be a dog in<br>Toronto so they were buying dogs off the<br>street and certainly rumored that they<br>people's pits went missing over there<br>times so here's the four of them this or<br>this was the team that discovered it so<br>I'm in fact the top two gentlemen and<br>Jeff James McClair John McLeod in and<br>Frederick Banting they both received<br>jointly the Nobel Prize and medicine for<br>that discovery and they then both share<br>that so Benton shared his portion of it<br>and with beast and James McLeod shared<br>it with collip who who was the<br>biochemist who was able to purify it<br>enough so that it would actually work<br>so the first child they gave it to<br>developed it was in a coma developed<br>terrible whenif Alexis and reactions to<br>what they gave it and then colic was<br>rushed in from the states he was able to<br>purify it enough to be in a week later I<br>try again and successful they're also<br>interesting because here's the only<br>photo with more than two of them in the<br>same location so so um collapse not<br>present here this is this is Banting<br>over here but but really they were<br>extremely dysfunctional and they didn't<br>talk to each other at all and in fact<br>shortly after the discovery MacLeod was<br>so upset he went back to Scotland and<br>they carried on but but this is the only<br>photo with three of them in the room and<br>there's no photo with four of them<br>together which is fairly interesting in<br>itself but then what they did discover<br>as they discovered and ceylon it record<br>lee went into production and eli lilly<br>who were involved right at an early<br>point at is still one of the main<br>insulin producing companies today and<br>and this is what it does so it converts<br>the some near-death through to a<br>slightly unhappy couple of children but<br>certainly a lot healthier than they were<br>before<br>and then Leonard Thompson he was the boy<br>who was in the coma at the start of the<br>story<br>he got the first extracts he somehow<br>managed to survive for a week while they<br>purified some more but it was thinks I<br>guess and part to him that we then<br>realized we hadn't solved the diabetes<br>problem so there was a lot of<br>celebration here diabetes was cured<br>everything was fine and you can see here<br>even in this photo probably relatively<br>shortly before his death he's using a<br>cane and so at the age of 25 he died<br>from complications of his diabetes so<br>just again emphasizing how important<br>good glycemic control has turned out to<br>be and restoring the longevity to these<br>people who are affected by diabetes and<br>so I guess with Leonard came a big push<br>to how we could improve things further<br>and I guess this is where glucose<br>monitoring came and it was always<br>present fortunately before my time that<br>may be how you trained Barry but here's<br>a urine flavor so here's a urine flavor<br>wheel and this is how you could of<br>course importantly he's demonstrating it<br>wasn't just the taste that was important<br>but also the color and the texture and<br>the smell and he's demonstrating<br>examining the urine but I'm sure he's<br>going to defend to that soon as well so<br>from here they actually took quite a<br>while so urine was the key method until<br>actually the nineteen sixties nineteen<br>seventies even the early nineteen<br>eighties were but first ability to<br>measure a blood glucose wasn't until the<br>early 1800s and the urine techniques<br>were all qualitative and they sort of<br>expanded over the 19th century and<br>really you can see an example here of<br>one of the methods used at the end of<br>World War two where basically it was all<br>by color so it's all qualitative you<br>would mix it up you'd heat it with a<br>Bunsen burner you'd get it warm enough<br>you'd keep it in it condition<br>for a period of time and then you'd read<br>the color five or ten minutes later we<br>had a really interesting talk by Jane<br>Parker who was the chief operating<br>officer in the lab currently she's been<br>working there for 50 years but she<br>described how in the 60s they were able<br>to do two or three blood glucose levels<br>a day each one took two hours to it to<br>brew up before you'd get the value so<br>she said her days were quiet when no one<br>wanted a blood glucose measurement but<br>and so we moved on from here and then in<br>the mid-1960s the first machine that<br>could measure blood glucose came took a<br>minute to test are you select to wash<br>away it was still colorimetric so you<br>still had to compare to color and it was<br>very expensive at weight over a kilo and<br>was only used in laboratories and and<br>clearly when Jane was talking as she was<br>talking about 1966 so certainly Dunedin<br>did not have even these machines until<br>the end of the 60s probably but clearly<br>now it's moved a long way they're small<br>this is the current funded I'll put a<br>point over here current funded meter<br>from far MEC they take only a very small<br>amount of blood extremely fast so you<br>get a result within two to five seconds<br>they're relatively cheap still still<br>cost many millions of dollars and<br>testing strips for the New Zealand<br>government every year but now we're also<br>moving into continuous glucose<br>monitoring which means the interstitial<br>glucose I'll talk about that a bit more<br>flash glucose monitoring which is a<br>another technology using that same<br>technology and then also how we<br>integrate that with insulin delivery to<br>create what we would call an artificial<br>pancreas or a closed loop and it's<br>differently where things are heating and<br>and I guess the reason I'm emphasizing<br>this is by glucose measurement is so<br>crucial it's really the basis of<br>everything we do I will not I guess not<br>only blood glucose but any form of<br>glucose measurement as you'll see for<br>the future there's also how we manage<br>all safety and it's also all glycemic<br>control is dependent on glucose<br>monitoring so these are nice data again<br>it's a surrogate I guess of adherence to<br>therapy but you can see here every<br>huge german-austrian database 26,000<br>children over ten years you can see<br>there every additional glucose level<br>they do to about a peak of sex will<br>improve their hba1c s by half a percent<br>or 5 millimoles per mole so the more<br>people interact with their diabetes the<br>healthier they will be here's a similar<br>data from America to show you exactly<br>the same thing the more your t'east<br>doesn't matter whether you're on a pump<br>whether you're injecting whatever you're<br>doing if your test Lots hba1c falls by<br>that half a percent every single time<br>your test this is the same sort of data<br>again but looking at giving me your<br>bonuses with insulin and again I guess<br>the glucose behavior mimics what your<br>bolus in behavior will be but if you<br>miss for meal doses a week your hba1c<br>goes up by one percenter about 10<br>millivolts per mole so what we really<br>want us to find ways to motivate people<br>to be adherent with the treatments we're<br>prescribing for them and I guess one of<br>the issues is how accurate is this and<br>and so the first paper here's a nice<br>example from a couple of my patients I'm<br>just showing here you can see the top<br>one this is a log book don't have too<br>many of these anymore but this sort of<br>perfect glucose yeah pretty perfect all<br>and target the occasional one drifting<br>above into double digits but mostly sort<br>of between four and eight the deer over<br>at their HPLC 110 so clearly there's no<br>way that log book the numbers in that<br>log book reflecting what the actual<br>glucose status of that patient is and<br>here's another one this is someone on a<br>pump heaps of data and here all<br>beautifully green and target HBO and see<br>a hundred there's no way that the data<br>that's going into that pump or into that<br>log book as the data that the patient is<br>actually experiencing and so this was<br>seen in early 1980s is the very first<br>glucose meters that were going out to<br>patients for their own home monitoring<br>and none of them were aware that you<br>could they had a memory function and<br>them latest thought they were just at<br>the time you tested it's the value you<br>got but of course<br>did have a memory and so these guys here<br>were the first to look back and that<br>memory and so they showed that about 75%<br>of all other participants in their study<br>modified their data and they coined this<br>interesting two muled the phantom and I<br>see lots of phantoms and my clinic but<br>that where there's a glucose level and<br>in the pump or in the logbook but<br>there's no actual glucose they believe<br>are being recorded and it's sort of a<br>cool name and I guess it just reflects<br>the significant food and that these<br>people are going through and also their<br>desire to be successful or to have<br>people go up get off their backs a whole<br>range of motivations for this but again<br>it goes in both directions people<br>obscure hi-po and they obscure<br>hyperglycemia so both equally important<br>and they also in this early paper showed<br>there was it didn't matter how good the<br>control of the diabetes was people was<br>really healthy control were just as<br>likely to create symptoms and fabricate<br>data as people were very unhealthy<br>control so possibly for slightly<br>different reasons but they're equally<br>likely to do the same thing and we've<br>been quite interested in so the early<br>some of our early work and diabetes was<br>in this exact area and we've published a<br>reasonable amount on this including the<br>only review in the area but again our<br>findings in modern patients are exactly<br>the same as that 1980s data that people<br>for various reasons don't accurately<br>document their blood glucose levels and<br>I guess the Krishna's they're a bit away<br>and I think technology's the way we just<br>remove their aspect of things from them<br>and continuous glucose monitoring as<br>we're things are heating so this is this<br>gives interstitial glucose so it's<br>inserted into the fat through the skin<br>it measures continuously or normally<br>every minute and this is continuously<br>updated and normally some sort of<br>algorithm will summarize that data for<br>you every 15 minutes or so uses exactly<br>the same glucose oxidase based reaction<br>that all the finger prick glucose meters<br>use as well and it's all hidden here and<br>the electrode here so here's a nice<br>picture Robert so this is the electrode<br>here it's normally made of<br>Gold and it seen signals to a<br>transmitter that's worn externally on<br>the body but what you do is you encase<br>there and a whole lot of peroxide and<br>then a range of other stuff to protect<br>the electrode so the body doesn't reject<br>it or get rid of it too quickly but then<br>when glucose penetrates this membrane<br>here it reacts with the peroxide this<br>peroxide has been converted into an<br>electrical charge that electrical charge<br>is picked up by the by the electrode<br>here transmits up and then we get a<br>glucose value that corresponds with the<br>amount of electrical charge you're<br>making from the amount of peroxide<br>you've made and so the secret of<br>continuously monitoring is you have to<br>be able to protect the electrode for<br>long enough that it when it's implanted<br>it's still useful over time and at the<br>moment we can normally get up to about<br>two weeks some people can even push<br>these sensors out to three weeks or even<br>four weeks depending on how quickly<br>their bodies will reject them but<br>certainly the companies would recommend<br>only a week at a time so the older<br>models are required two or three<br>calibrations a day there's no models of<br>continuous glucose monitoring and New<br>Zealand that don't require calibration<br>but there is a new device down here the<br>g6 disk on g6 which requires no<br>calibration and there's also this thing<br>called the Libra or the flesh glucose<br>monitoring and I'll talk about that now<br>I know here's just this is just showing<br>you how powerful this technology is so<br>these are traces of patients from my<br>clinic but again just showing so the<br>green here is 0 for 2 teen and just<br>showing how you get these sort of rises<br>and falls and glucose levels<br>continuously every minute and throughout<br>the day and then we can adjust all our<br>treatments based on these values of<br>course it creates a fairly extensive<br>burden on time for our clinic so in the<br>old days where they just had a logbook<br>and there are a few glucose levels in it<br>and you had two different types of<br>insulin you could prescribe it was all<br>pretty straightforward you could power<br>through the patients you just can't now<br>I'm constantly being emailed by people<br>and asked people to look through this<br>data so there's certainly other<br>challenges that comes with the amount of<br>information that we're now getting but<br>certainly we think it's improving the<br>lives of the people<br>using and here's some young woman here<br>just grabbed off the internet but she's<br>wearing the g6 this is she I tried to<br>find a child she was pretty much the<br>only one I could find we're hearing one<br>but the main thing show you just what it<br>looks like that's how big it is and the<br>g5 and the g4 are and New Zealand<br>they're exactly the same size but what's<br>cool about this model other than it can<br>go onto your SmartWatch there you get a<br>continuous trace whenever you look at<br>you watch while you're sitting in my<br>talk I can go into your phone and it's<br>the insertion device you just sort of<br>plugged it onto your skin and push the<br>button and Washington but but it's also<br>an amazingly accurate so this has a mean<br>absolute relative difference so this is<br>comparing to a gold standard and in this<br>study that's to a factory calibrated<br>glucose lab based technology but its<br>accuracy is 7.7 percent so deviates from<br>the gold standard by plus or minus seven<br>point seven which is sort of that the<br>gold standard of any sort of glucose<br>monitoring their common meters that we<br>use have an accuracy of about 10 percent<br>and so this device looks pretty amazing<br>really it's factory calibrated there's<br>no blood glucose levels required you can<br>make all your treatment decisions based<br>on this device no calibrations most<br>people using one of these would test<br>once or twice a week maybe and you can<br>wear this for ten days before it comes<br>out of course it probably costs it's<br>only available in the States at the<br>moment it'll be here in the next six<br>months but it's going to cost I guess<br>about eight to ten thousand dollars a<br>then we've got flesh glucose monitoring<br>this has been a big boon the area at the<br>moment earlier last year it received<br>approval for use and children in New<br>Zealand but it had approval for use in<br>the UK a few years before there but I<br>guess this has been a sort of a<br>revolutionary technology all of this<br>glucose monitoring technology I'm<br>showing you is the next revolution I<br>think there's no doubt that we'll look<br>back on blood glucose in the same way we<br>sort of amusingly look back on urine<br>there's no<br>about that so so this is flesh glucose<br>monitoring and you wear the same sort of<br>sensor but instead of being continuously<br>delivered it's only available to you<br>when you swipe you can swipe your phone<br>or you can swipe your device over it and<br>get your glucose values and again you<br>get the same sort of trace it's a new<br>that we can adjust glucose levels by but<br>certainly this is the first cheap and<br>readily available technology that<br>requires no blood glucose levels so most<br>people using this around the testing a<br>handful of times a week but it has a few<br>downsides as a small leg depending on<br>the participant some people will leg<br>four or five minutes some will leg only<br>a minute from their blood glucose so<br>whatever you're really getting on your<br>screen may not reflect what the glucose<br>is doing at that moment some people if<br>you're at the worst end of the speech<br>would take about 20 minutes to acquittal<br>eyes between their blood and their<br>interstitial fluid and it's pretty<br>accurate<br>eleven point four percent as the mean<br>absolute relative difference between<br>that and the gold standard and they<br>again you have these Clark era grids<br>that's how you measure all this stuff<br>they're basically you can see the since<br>the glucose and the capillary reader<br>reference range here they are very much<br>clustered together down the center there<br>so very closely correlated and again and<br>this and this sort of seminal paper on<br>on how accurate and successful this was<br>the mean leg time was about four and a<br>half minutes it's also a little bit less<br>accurate on the first day of we're and<br>that's what we often find is something<br>about the immune reaction when you put a<br>sensor and doesn't work quite as well is<br>it the same accurate no you know none of<br>the sensors appear to be so when you're<br>very low good question when that when<br>you're low they tend to be less accurate<br>so it will often read low when you're<br>actually normal so we do recommend to<br>our patients when they're low they do<br>test at the moment with these devices to<br>avoid over treating the main worried<br>readers then they sort of rollercoaster<br>through the day they over treat they end<br>up out of target much harder to fix a<br>high blood glucose than others to fix a<br>low blood glucose<br>in the same at the extremes and effects<br>some of the companies the dicks the<br>dicks calm the data the dicks calm data<br>I showed earlier they've been fairly<br>honest they include a data up to the<br>maximum of the device they were using to<br>reference to the kids which is into the<br>30s but some of the devices to get their<br>accuracy they only report within a<br>narrow range so they remove all blood<br>glucose values above 30 say they remove<br>all blood glucose levels below 2 and<br>then they give a reported accuracy for<br>their range but of course when you're<br>outside of that range they may be far<br>more inaccurate than they report and fix<br>some of them as much as 20% inaccurate<br>when when they're in target they report<br>to teen but then they go out to about 20<br>percent so it's quite a range but again<br>this is sort of really summarizing that<br>data I showed of those big data bases<br>this is 60 million tests using this<br>device published by the company but you<br>can just see again this is an estimated<br>hba1c based on the CGM trace and and as<br>you swipe more you're getting fairly<br>obsessive when you're swiping 30 40 or<br>50 times a day we may be creating some<br>other issues with the technology but<br>there's certainly no doubt that if you<br>use it a lot you're extremely adherent<br>and your diabetes is extremely healthy<br>this is number of scans per day and<br>hours below oh sorry hours above our<br>team so again the time you spend out of<br>target dramatically reduces the more<br>your skin and basically all of these<br>trace and say something's very similar<br>to that you spend this time high five<br>this time hyper more time than range and<br>the HPLC is much healthier and again the<br>reality is hba1c is slowly dying it's a<br>technology that we are all used to and<br>we're used to recording to work out the<br>risk to our patients going forward of<br>complications but there's no doubt now<br>and our group we're arguing more and<br>more should we as hba1c our primary<br>outcome anymore in the studies and<br>certainly one of the studies we're doing<br>this quite a lot of argument that it<br>should be all continuous glucose<br>monitoring tracers they're much more<br>reflective of a lot of what we are<br>interested in what's happening to the<br>glucose levels through the day then<br>that a measure of glycation on immigrant<br>every three months and we've become<br>quite interesting teenagers this just<br>emphasizes what happens and teenage<br>years so this is age along the bottom<br>here you can see here this is very<br>stable phase from around thirty twenty<br>five to thirty where HPLC comes very<br>close to the sort of ranges we would<br>like in our clinic we would say we want<br>people under 55 so that's sort of down<br>here so we want people at 7% and the old<br>tombs we want them as below that as we<br>can safely give them you can see here<br>firstly not many people achieve there<br>and greater than 75% of the youth and<br>this started here so this is twenty<br>thousand American children and children<br>and that part and then all their adult<br>data are out here since even more than<br>20,000 near but greater than 75% of the<br>youth don't come even close to meeting<br>targets and what you can see here is<br>when you become a teenager you have this<br>massive spike and your hba1c and then it<br>all just settles out again once their<br>frontal lobes develop a bit more and so<br>we're very interested in that group that<br>pretty much exclusively ignored from<br>every trial and every drug company child<br>I know quite a challenging group to do<br>research on but we're really interested<br>with those people who are struggling<br>with they benefit from some of this<br>technology particularly the flesh<br>glucose monitoring technology with no<br>calibrations where as an easy insertion<br>you can get more glucose data<br>you're clearly reducing their burden so<br>a day a group that might benefit from<br>some of this technology and we've got a<br>study currently running on there and so<br>we're recruiting people who aged<br>thirteen to twenty inclusive we're I<br>think when I wrote the slide we're at 55<br>out of 64 I think cos only we've maybe<br>we're 58 and two more being screened<br>this week so so we're thinking and the<br>next week or two we'll finish enrollment<br>and their trial but basically it's two<br>phases there's an RCT phase for six<br>months where half of the participants<br>get the device and half of them don't<br>and then there's another six month phase<br>where everybody gets the device and they<br>continue<br>raishin phase so we're very excited by<br>that it's funded by cure kids IEP games<br>in SSD and there's a need in school<br>medicine so we've had really generous<br>funding to run that and it's completely<br>independent of the company so again a<br>lot of the money we're spending on the<br>trailers and and the sensors themselves<br>is how funders there and I guess what<br>we're also becoming more interested in<br>hopefully next time we talk I can give<br>you some data on it but I'm quite<br>interested in these open what the calls<br>are open source or open nexus hex or<br>add-ons that you can put onto some of<br>these devices so the free style Libre<br>that I showed you with the DAO trials<br>running on that's about two and a half<br>thousand dollars a year to run so it's<br>about a half to a third this expensive<br>than the continuous glucose monitoring<br>technology but with one of these devices<br>here so this device here the blue con or<br>this one here which has got this great<br>name called the meow-meow you can put<br>one of those on and you can you can<br>imagine the meow-meow is purchased from<br>China somewhere there's not been a<br>single study done on either of these<br>devices but basically that converts the<br>signal from your freestyle Libre into a<br>continuous source of bluetooth of all<br>material and so it tricks the sensor<br>into thinking it's being swiped all the<br>time and then you can transmit it on to<br>your SmartWatch or to your phone and you<br>can put alarms on it and you can get all<br>the benefits theoretically of much more<br>expensive technology for this is $300<br>and it lasts until the some time that<br>Chinese electronics lasts and this is<br>similar that this is waterproof we think<br>there might be quite a ton kids this one<br>he is not waterproof but again no one<br>knows if they're any good but the<br>anecdotal stuff is that they they can be<br>very good and they can also be a real<br>pain in the butt sometimes as well and<br>so we've got a few we've got some<br>funding applications and for a CT on<br>this soon to hopefully<br>what's also just come out in the last<br>few months is implantable CTMS<br>technology so this is how you do it you<br>make her we incisions but like putting<br>in<br>long-acting reversible contraception you<br>make a wee incision they have this big<br>introducer devices that they turn your<br>own client your sensor and you put a<br>couple of steri-strips on it and then<br>they they go off on their way and so<br>this could be ever since this is the FDA<br>sort of media release here from the date<br>June 25th so let's just come out in the<br>states with FDA approval that's how big<br>the sensor is that's the one cent coin<br>and America so you just have about two<br>centimeters long it lasts for three<br>months and about eighty or ninety<br>percent of the people that you put it in<br>surgically inserted and and again they<br>they've cut off the extremes but but if<br>you if you put that aside it's got a mod<br>of 8.8% so very accurate so I plus or<br>minus like when I seen on what the what<br>the gold standard glucose measurement<br>would be although they determine what<br>the gold standard would be so with all<br>the study you've got to be a little<br>nervous because sometimes it's not what<br>we would consider a gold sting but<br>basically that gives implanted and then<br>you wear this removable sensor over top<br>of it and you just strap that on and<br>whenever you want you can pull it off<br>but the device vibrates and does a range<br>of other things even when you're not<br>looking at your glucose levels so it'll<br>tell you if you go low it'll tell you if<br>you go out of target it looks very<br>interesting at the moment I wouldn't be<br>standing in line to be one of the first<br>people to wear one of these this one of<br>the hundred or so people and the first<br>trial had ever GAE to get it out again<br>when I'm out but certainly this is where<br>things are heading so this is I don't<br>think you want to be an early adopter<br>with with any of the stuff but this is<br>the first go and and and it's gonna give<br>heaps better so that's what it looks<br>like an again that's at transmitting to<br>your smartphone or each your SmartWatch<br>and I guess just bits a bit like this<br>this is 1960 this is an insulin pump and<br>I guess why I'm interested knows is<br>because the whole proofs are doing all<br>this glucose monitoring is if we can<br>hook those two pumps then we've created<br>an artificial pancreas and get it all<br>communicating we can remove some of the<br>human error side of it then we'll both<br>remove true dramatically reduce the<br>burden to these<br>people that will also definitely improve<br>their health so this is what an original<br>pump this is 1963 this photo gets thrown<br>around a lot it and all these sort of<br>talks but this has also got glucagon in<br>it so maybe it's need to be half the<br>size if you just hit insulin but he's<br>got a couple of sort of fairly full-on<br>cannulas going on there I'd have trouble<br>selling that to our teens and Clinic but<br>now that this is this is the most funded<br>version now in our clinics amfAR makes<br>very generously been funding these since<br>2012 giving us sort of world leading<br>access to pumps although they are not<br>the world leading pumps so so we watch<br>the space for that but basically they<br>provide continuous and chillin and it's<br>record acting insulins so it's either a<br>spot or the SPRO so no very food or<br>Humalog and it's constantly infused<br>getting rid of the need for other types<br>of insulin so there's no more basal<br>insulin thus insulin that's there to<br>provide that ground cover for all the<br>glucose your body makes and you infuse<br>rapid acting insulin instead and then<br>every time you induce carbohydrate and I<br>guess if you're German<br>and they also count protein as well we<br>generally stick to counting carbs but<br>there are the Germans love counting<br>protein as well they do both but if you<br>count the carbs and then you can give<br>yourself<br>bolus insulin to manage your glucose<br>fluctuations and all of us users in<br>computer you have settings<br>pre-programmed and it's also Abood and<br>reducer so in all the studies done on<br>these everybody's quality of life<br>improves and those studies normally and<br>every study that has been measured<br>quality of life's improved the HPA<br>Yvonne see reductions are possibly not<br>as impressive as you would hope so they<br>improve things by around point 2 to 0.5%<br>and the big meter analyses there's<br>plenty of studies around where there was<br>an improvement of 1% or things like that<br>it also depends on what group you do you<br>study on it also depends on how long it<br>is because people fatigue if you measure<br>a study with ADD outcome of only three<br>months primary outcome then everybody<br>improves by about a per seat when you<br>put a device like this on<br>them but if you really want to know<br>what's going to happen in the real world<br>you've got to follow them for at least<br>year to really understand what's going<br>on and they also reduce severe<br>hypoglycemia so that's one of the main<br>criteria for farm it for us to get<br>people onto pumps and really all the<br>data in the past was a bit inconclusive<br>on that but all the recent data is very<br>supportive on its role in preventing<br>hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia is<br>certainly the biggest year families have<br>about their diabetes and this is what<br>pumps look like now so these are the new<br>generation of pumps so so the model that<br>farm X funded now they were new in about<br>2008 and I guess and we're definitely<br>ready for an upgrade and farm X<br>currently considering this now and I<br>think we're expecting a decision anytime<br>in October maybe and November and I<br>would anticipate I'm hoping they'll fund<br>both of these this is the replacement to<br>the outgoing model we're more than 95<br>percent of our patients are using and<br>this here is the pump that are there<br>this company here by Medtronic is the<br>main pump company in the world they have<br>about 95 percent of the world market<br>they have about 1 percent of the New<br>Zealand market but that's the Sydney<br>coming and this is just an idea this is<br>their pump here with this is what the<br>infusion see it looks like and then<br>there's a wee cannula or are we needle<br>in the body here and you would insert<br>this only every three days or so but<br>then this is communicating with this<br>glucose sensor so this is a continuous<br>glucose monitor and it communicates to<br>the pump and in this case and the system<br>did this pump that far MEK we hope<br>pharmacal fund it does a few other<br>clever tricks using that data you can<br>see that they're very much in line with<br>sort of the modern devices that people<br>are used to using now you know that reg<br>this was modelled offer an iPhone and<br>this is a bit of our data unpublished<br>that just showing what's happens that's<br>you fund insulin pump so this is the<br>proportion of users so up to 0.15 and<br>this one this is by year and this is our<br>gender this one so you can see for<br>whatever reason females are more likely<br>to get access to this than male<br>but the ones that really interests me is<br>this one here and this one here this is<br>New Zealand Europeans so if your New<br>Zealand European you dramatically have<br>improved access to this even though we<br>use the same criteria and the same<br>public funding for all so this is<br>Pacific down the bottom here and this is<br>Maori and then this is the same first<br>economic deprivation so this is the<br>least deprived and the most deprived so<br>even when you publicly fund these things<br>it's not the end of the story and<br>there's other stuff going on that limits<br>quite large percentages of the<br>population from accessing this stuff<br>this is age not a surprise if you're<br>young up to about thirty percent of<br>youth are now using pumps and in my<br>clinic it's about fifty percent and if<br>you're over 70 not quite as much use<br>here but I've certainly given a talk<br>recently where someone who was over 80<br>came up to me at the end and showed me<br>his pump and see they just had it for a<br>few years and was was enjoying it but it<br>had some problems and that's the main<br>thing there are some problems the<br>infusion sites fail the body rejects<br>them things get kinked they leak<br>sometimes the technology fails every now<br>and then there are surprisingly reliable<br>and despite all of that people say they<br>would they don't want to give them back<br>that we've been quite interested in this<br>and again published quite a bit on on<br>adverse events so I guess the real thing<br>here is all of this this is insulin<br>being discovered in the 1920s coming<br>through and this is glucose monitoring<br>technology improving you can just see as<br>all of that's happened it's all coming<br>to this pointy end where we're starting<br>to get close to those sort of the Holy<br>Grail this is the artificial pancreas or<br>or what we call the closing the loop so<br>we close the loop between what the<br>participant is to do you're connecting<br>the glucose monitoring to the pump<br>making a complete cycle that that<br>removes the patient from what's going on<br>inside there and that's really what<br>people want this is some of the early<br>data sirs published in one of the main<br>diabetes journals W skier this last year<br>and this is you<br>using the technology that PHARMAC will<br>be funding they found me I'll fund the<br>device that can do it that they won't<br>fund the seat sirs so then you're still<br>have to buy a since it was $5,000 a year<br>to run it but here's the sensor here's<br>the device and basically what the stars<br>is in this version of the technology it<br>looks out into the future as an<br>algorithm it's constantly assessing the<br>glucose data and when you're thirty<br>minutes out from going low it turns<br>itself off so this is at three point<br>three here predicts you're gonna go low<br>attends itself off and then ideally then<br>starts to rise again turns the pump back<br>on and then it carries on so the aim of<br>this is to remove the the really major<br>fear that people have that they're going<br>to have hypoglycemia while they're<br>sleeping that's the main fear they have<br>their children are going to die and<br>children do die so there's a condition<br>called Eden bead where the child's found<br>dead in the morning no one knows what's<br>happened is thought to be hypoglycemia<br>perhaps connected to an arrhythmia that<br>the hypoglycemia may or may not<br>precipitate it's very rare but it's what<br>everyone's worried about and I guess<br>this will also work while you're doing<br>sport sort of turn the pump off while<br>you're doing your sport turn it back on<br>again when you're coming right and so<br>this is the data on that so basically<br>it's just it halves the amount of<br>hypoglycemia it's not perfect but it<br>rigid halves what you're seeing and<br>again the only interesting thing with<br>this technology this is that this is the<br>Medtronic<br>device that we likely funded here is<br>actually the time above target so the<br>time above eight actually deteriorates<br>slightly so whenever the pumps being<br>turned off it's not quite coming on and<br>quick enough to stop you're going to<br>rising afterwards so again we need to<br>perfect it a bit be a competitor has<br>just published their data which shows no<br>rise and time above target so there's<br>quite a theist sort of rivalry and<br>baseball going on with some of it but<br>this all of this is moving the next step<br>and it's currently available in the<br>states but not yet funded here is what<br>we call hybrid closed loop so it runs<br>and closed loop quite a large amount of<br>the time but you still have to signal to<br>it<br>tell it how much carbohydrate you're<br>eating and also in the current<br>technology tell it what your blood<br>glucose level is so it won't take the<br>glucose level at sentencing to do your<br>food bolus --is you have to tell it that<br>yourself you have to manually do that<br>and you still have to calibrate that<br>system so that if you buy that system in<br>the states now for twelve thousand<br>dollars tomorrow<br>you set to run your sensor to five<br>thousand a year you still have to<br>calibrate that with finger pressed a<br>minimum of two times a day the more you<br>calibrate it the more accurate it<br>becomes but this is the sort of data you<br>get this is insulin delivery its<br>blipping along here glucose levels risen<br>a little bit here oh sorry that's their<br>place model insulin delivery rates<br>that's plasma insulin and there in the<br>infusion right and this is peered with<br>glucose levels here so glucose there was<br>a bit higher giving much more insulin<br>here but then when it senses you're<br>going low turns everything off so you be<br>a delivery goes right down placements<br>and drops and then it starts to rise<br>again the insulin will bend kick off<br>again so so it does that and you end up<br>with these beautiful loops a bit like<br>this if you look at someone's glucose<br>using one of these systems that clamps<br>you at 6.8 you just run all night long<br>like that no matter what's been going on<br>just turns you on and off to keep you in<br>there so that people in the studies on<br>this sort of device they just don't want<br>to give them their I just love them even<br>though you have to calibrate and so this<br>is called the 6 7 eg ibrid look closely<br>it's been around since 2016 has no basal<br>rates at all it just uses its own<br>calculations to determine how much<br>insulin you need when you're fasting or<br>sleeping but you signal to it your<br>carbohydrate in the glucose data it's<br>not registered for use in people under 7<br>and their argument is that the<br>algorithms get less accurate if you're<br>on much lower doses of insulin I think<br>also you know worried well the biggest<br>fear of all the companies with this<br>technology is that something bad happens<br>with it that then causes us a big step<br>back from this technology for people and<br>no one wants them and this uses their<br>latest sensor which looks I'm really<br>good and it's the only scene<br>currently approved to use with hybrid<br>closely so this is how it works and this<br>is what it does this is a Bionic<br>pancreas or some one of the groups calls<br>there is the Bionic pancreas which is<br>pretty cool this is published in the<br>lancet<br>just last year but again this is on<br>Bionic paint courier so just make sure I<br>get this right oh yes oh this is Bionic<br>pancreas here so just tightens<br>everything out you spin this time low<br>this time high much more time and target<br>so under ten almost 90% of the time was<br>spent and target on this device where if<br>you look at traditional this is by using<br>continuous glucose monitoring in a pump<br>so still pretty high-tech staff more<br>high-tech than what far make funds but<br>they spend about 60% of the time in<br>target so that's this what we're looking<br>at the Bionic pancreas is dual hormone<br>that uses both glucagon and insulin so<br>they wear two pumps and and there's a<br>range of issues with it I think<br>personally we're unlikely to go forward<br>with it too much more but there are<br>still going for there and I guess why<br>we're interested in this is as we're<br>we've got a world first study coming<br>here to Simba January and collaboration<br>with Christchurch and quite significant<br>funding and so this this is super<br>exciting no one else in the world will<br>have have used this technology and and<br>so it's the next iteration of that<br>technology from the one I just showed<br>you so 670 G's what's available America<br>and this is their new algorithm and and<br>it's thought to be even more exciting<br>exciting and we're hoping to prove that<br>doesn't need calibration and so that'll<br>be run from here twenty participants<br>here in Dunedin and twenty participants<br>in Christchurch and they'll be aged 14<br>to 70 they have to be using a pump and<br>so if anyone in the audience is wearing<br>a pump and wants to try the latest<br>they're welcome to come and talk to me<br>afterwards but I'm so there are<br>established pumpers we're very excited<br>about this it's it's gonna mean that<br>South Island families get to try out the<br>latest stuff before it goes anywhere<br>else and I guess we're hoping the study<br>will go well and then more of those<br>studies within run year as well<br>so again looking here not a single<br>mention of hba1c as a primary outcome<br>it's all about time spent in range time<br>spent hypoglycemic and then a bunch of<br>other secondary outcomes so hba1c again<br>is quietly dying it's eventually going<br>to be replaced with all this stuff and<br>we've also very interested in this<br>device and again with with martin<br>debauch who is the primary investigator<br>for that previous study we've got an HST<br>application that's into the seeking<br>round for this and this is taking<br>advantage of this thing called the open<br>APs and so basically these are a whole<br>bunch of really clever people were<br>affected by diabetes who have been<br>really distressed at how slow it's been<br>for the companies to close the loop<br>basically it's taking a long long time<br>you know so that pump in 1963 well now<br>we have 50 years later we're just<br>starting to close the loop now so<br>certainly they've they've become up<br>sleep and so a number of people have<br>invented their own closed loop<br>algorithms and today<br>traditionally they have what the sky he<br>has got it's quite a few thousand people<br>using this around the world now and he<br>builds his own device and then he hex<br>into an old-fashioned and chi'lan pump<br>he hex into the continuous glucose<br>monitor and then he brings it all<br>together any runs as I own closed loop<br>with a algorithm that he's devised or<br>he's downloaded off the internet and<br>they they say these thousands of people<br>but it's an N equals one because you<br>make you have to make your own system<br>you can't buy one you can't do anything<br>else but what's and this is what this is<br>his night<br>you can just see again how beautiful his<br>glucose levels are through the night<br>using that device and I guess why we're<br>into what's even more exciting though as<br>with this pump here that I've got about<br>0.1% year of the world's pump market<br>maybe least but they've maybe a pump<br>they've seen this niche and they've made<br>their pump so you don't have to hack it<br>anymore they just let you into it so you<br>can go inside this you can hook up your<br>Deeks comm g6 sensor here to it<br>you can run your algorithm in the and<br>the pump all goes through your phone and<br>it does exactly what that other<br>technology does but it does it for<br>extremely cheap price computer the<br>company technology again none of it is<br>fully integrated none of it's made by<br>the same person there's no research on<br>it other than from the people who are<br>doing it but people who are doing it<br>love it and extremely passionate and<br>they've got this hashtag on Twitter<br>called we are not waiting<br>and so that device is there and so we've<br>got a funding grant and at the moment to<br>try and fund a fairly large study<br>running there and so I guess the game<br>just sort of as I close up just<br>highlighting that things have moved from<br>here and I guess we laugh at this a<br>little bit we've moved to here but I<br>think we'll be doing the same thing here<br>I'll be giving this talk in 30 years and<br>I'll be telling you how we used to<br>torture our children by doing all these<br>finger pricks on them and laugh at that<br>I think man why did we do that craze and<br>stuff because we'll be moving until this<br>extra who knows what it is but here's a<br>sort of a Star Trek body scanner here<br>I'm sure we'll be able to do glucose by<br>that the hep Sam Soon and so just to<br>thank all that people have been involved<br>in those studies and our funders at the<br>bottom of the currently running studies<br>but I think the thunders of future<br>do you want that do you want the queue<br>I've been told I need to use the queue<br>there<br>so Tim descents is that so well if you<br>leave something and dwelling in the body<br>it's a good like an IV cannula<br>it'll reject it in the sense that it'll<br>bang up your seats eventually and so and<br>the same with the insulin infusion<br>devices because that little Teflon or<br>little steel cannulas they're very small<br>for the infusions they it's safe to say<br>that you should change that every three<br>days but like an IV exactly like an IV<br>can heal that should be changed every<br>three days otherwise the body burns it<br>up because you're using rapid acting<br>insulin the whole time if you have any<br>any period of time where that flow of<br>read predicting insulin is interrupted<br>you get sick fast so they get DKA very<br>quickly if they have any interruption<br>that flows that's why it's important the<br>sensors themselves the way they are<br>protecting them that we're getting out<br>to a couple of weeks of protection from<br>the body and those senses and there<br>doesn't appear to be a big drop-off in<br>their accuracy over time going up beyond<br>a few weeks who knows so there are<br>people who who sort of hack their senses<br>and run them out even longer people who<br>you can send them to over you know in<br>the States or even in parts of New<br>Zealand he'll pick them and change the<br>batteries and all sorts of cool stuff to<br>them again no one quite knows what any<br>of it's doing in terms of because I<br>stuck on you with us with a strong<br>adhesive certainly there is a group of<br>people who have quite nasty skin<br>reactions from them it's in the odd and<br>fiction considering how many people<br>we've got on pumps I've had one kid with<br>a wee ABC Sanders but I had to drain in<br>clinic one day and that but other than<br>that we've not seen major infections or<br>problems but they do get they do get<br>skin things it's a known complication of<br>the gear so as soon as we find a way to<br>bypass strong adhesives I guess that's<br>why the implant of all seam scissors<br>some people very excited about those<br>because it gets around or that all the<br>adhesive and and I guess more visibly<br>you know obvious you know some of the<br>I might be one of the concerns we've had<br>with medical devices and<br>pharmacovigilance is that they haven't<br>had the clinical testing medicines I was<br>just wondering if you need for the<br>recent and the you to get FDA approval<br>with our sort of one or two hundred<br>participants yeah they're not thousands<br>of participants interesting with very<br>few numbers and studies or certainly the<br>670 GE this is the hybrid closed loop B<br>FDA expedite a bit because there was so<br>much unhappiness that they had been very<br>slow and an effect the previous<br>technologies everywhere in the world got<br>access to them before the Americans<br>because the FDA so so there has been<br>this expedited FDA process which may<br>mean they've cut some of the corners<br>they would have previously done but<br>certainly this is a quite a number of<br>trials already run on hybrid closed-loop<br>and they always that's what very<br>cautious that they begin with in clinics<br>supervised assessments only so they they<br>begin with in the hospital and then they<br>run them and camp sitting so you know my<br>friend Martin who who were working with<br>and collaborating with in Christchurch<br>he's done some of those i I was involved<br>in the product of local host has been<br>trials at the beginning but he's been<br>involved in this next-generation until<br>they hire out a whole lot of cabins and<br>a in a resort or whatever and then he<br>sits there in a room with all their data<br>coming to them and and they just hang<br>out in the place they every day they get<br>a food order and they get whatever food<br>they want and there's many video games<br>that's they want and<br>and they do that but so extremely<br>supervised the early data and there and<br>it's those studies that give the FDA<br>approval for that device yeah no we were<br>really excited about the studies that<br>will be running certainly no doubt there<br>are some there are safety issues with<br>these devices diabetes in general is<br>very dangerous itself and so the current<br>technologies appear to be least safe<br>been slightly unsafe alternatives so I<br>think it's important not to lose sight<br>of how unsafe the underlying illnesses<br>and I guess some of them or particularly<br>those like then open ap its movement<br>where they're really pushing the<br>boundaries of things that's how worried<br>about their diabetes these people are<br>they're going to quite extraordinary<br>means to improve their health and<br>certainly there's no big signals that<br>it's any less healthy or more dangerous<br>than anything else people have been<br>trying or using before and certainly in<br>the trials they don't want to give the<br>stuff back so I think that's we don't<br>want to lose sight there'll be a lot of<br>huge number of very upset patients that<br>we slow this stuff down too much it at<br>least lipo hypertrophy there's a bit of<br>data saying you might get a little bit<br>more like a trophy which is where you<br>get a sort of an immune reaction eats<br>out affect so I do have the odd patient<br>around who ends up with a big hollowed<br>out area and it's that's gene really<br>very hard to manage<br>it's mostly again they they wouldn't<br>they don't want to stop using their<br>device they just we need to run it along<br>the edges so that it hollows it out more<br>evenly but those people are relatively<br>uncommon that's one maybe one two<br>percent of users the really extreme<br>examples where you get a great big patch<br>of eating outfit there even this common<br>but I certainly have at least one person<br>I can think of with that but it shows<br>you how much they like it they don't<br>want to stop if we run these sites<br>around the edges you can even it out a<br>bit if you change sites more often that<br>can help people have tried other things<br>not it doesn't do it by kikuchiyo fee<br>which has big fit big lumps from over<br>injecting in the same place it's numb<br>and they and they've much prefer to<br>inject it somewhere it doesn't here<br>though it's much better on a pump and it<br>pumps one way of treating they start<br>using that device fear endorsing this<br>we're not endorsing this and we're<br>really good I think it's a little bit of<br>uncharted territory probably I would be<br>assuming that if the consumer buys this<br>gear off their own bed which is what's<br>been happening with the crystal debris<br>so before it was available in New<br>Zealand the first time I ever saw it was<br>on a patient who just walked into clinic<br>as he I just bought this from the UK and<br>it's made a lot of people quite<br>uncomfortable<br>although the alternative I think is much<br>worse you know my job is to help relieve<br>their suffering if I refuse to support<br>something that they're going to do<br>anyway then I think I put them in more<br>danger than if I provide support of it I<br>don't kind of [ __ ] relief strongly<br>advocate for it I completely understand<br>why they would want to do it but because<br>in my approach has been that if they ask<br>about<br>we will talk about it and we'll support<br>it if they buy it to the best of our<br>ability but they need to be aware that<br>that bikes no data on it and things like<br>that that I think it's too far back<br>things like the meow-meow or things like<br>that we've been talking about it with<br>families because they're desperate for<br>continuous glucose monitoring can't<br>afford the alternatives and so we raise<br>it I think it's reasonable they're gonna<br>find out anyway most of them I've<br>already read things online about it we<br>say there's no data on it we don't know<br>anything about it we say we're wanting<br>to run a trial on it we can put you in<br>our trial or you can buy it you can give<br>it a whirl we'll happily help you to the<br>best of our ability but no and I say<br>there's no data on it those good but<br>anecdotally they ought to be they have<br>their own quirks that's thought to be<br>similar to what the alternatives are I<br>think it's a really tricky area there's<br>no I think ASA C likely will step in and<br>New Zealand I think people are petrified<br>in other jurisdictions about what you do<br>it's been a strong message from the<br>Australian Diabetes Association that<br>doctors have to support people and these<br>decisions there's been a large group of<br>endocrinologist have refused to treat<br>people who have gone and bought the<br>stuff and I especially think that's more<br>an easy call then supporting them in<br>their decisions but they need to know<br>where to get the evidence I mean it's<br>like when somebody just charges<br>themselves against me 35 this is not<br>against medical advice but it's not<br>actually with good evidence base to<br>support is that worth giving a<br>information machine that consent and as<br>that is the DHB lawyer was looking at<br>just two other offices like that you<br>know we're not selling them in clinic<br>you know I have nothing I've got no<br>connection to those devices so I'm not<br>they just buy them on the internet yeah<br>I was the issue is say somebody dies in<br>northern ice and the family so they were<br>using this device and they were getting<br>I think it's uncharted territory isn't<br>it I mean it's probably gonna happen at<br>some point because people are dying from<br>their hypoglycemia right now I guess at<br>the moment we just claim we've had<br>nothing to do with it and and you know<br>it's sad that we know I think the<br>problem they've got is if we withdraw<br>the support and I think the only<br>dangerous or but it's the actual<br>actively suggesting this might be an<br>option they didn't think of that you<br>know I think it's an interesting area i<br>I don't know what the answer is we could<br>never take my ideas about it my ideas<br>come out strongly in support of<br>supporting people I guess I guess you're<br>right we have to be quite careful about<br>think as long as we yeah I think as long<br>as they're aware of the risks and the<br>potential benefits in they you know<br>really our people are going to partner<br>with us to manage their healthcare they<br>have to take some responsibility for<br>some of the actions they're taking in my<br>view I you know I guess ideally we meet<br>we have a full partnership where they<br>know of the risks and the benefits are<br>and if they want to move ahead it makes<br>you nervous you don't have a consent<br>form signed by them I guess if we don't<br>supplying it what am i consenting them I<br>think I think you're right I I'm nervous<br>I'm just not sure what the solution is<br>given that I'm not handing it to them i<br>if I was handing it to the my guess I<br>usually I could say John what you do in<br>this situation what would the Medical<br>Association say what would Medical<br>and that's been our approach to date as<br>we say no one knows anything about this<br>but anecdotally there's a lot of talk if<br>you're interested in doing it and you<br>can't afford the other options which are<br>approved this is what it's called and<br>we'll help you as much as we can but<br>it's you know by a buyer beware it's<br>your own risk and certainly those<br>devices are pushing these boundaries<br>because certainly with the freestyle<br>Libra we add more than 10% of our clinic<br>using it before it was even available to<br>purchase in New Zealand so so this is<br>just the beginning of a wave of things<br>that consumers and patients will be<br>buying and using and challenging us with<br>diabetes is just the tip of the iceberg<br>for this you know we people buying the<br>anti-cancer drugs off the internet soon<br>I'm sure you know that we're going to<br>India to get them you know diabetes is<br>probably the small print and this really<br>challenging patient-driven we've been<br>encouraging patients to drive things for<br>a while though so I guess we got to be<br>careful we don't get too upset now that<br>they actually start doing it you know<br>part of me thinks that they actually<br>that's sort of a good thing if they're<br>going to tell in just a bit<br>if they want a fully partner though then<br>they can't take it the other way when it<br>goes wrong I can't be held liable for<br>interesting</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
