Martine darou her two<br>East Street neighbours in st. Leonard's<br>who are my neighbors as well her<br>university friends raehwan Crump Chris J<br>and my Clegg who is now retired from the<br>University of Otago but who drove here<br>from the west coast in order to be here<br>Mike very welcome to you and of course<br>all of Ruth's students who have taken<br>time out of their busy day to come and<br>join in this celebration<br>now as all of you in this room know the<br>rank of professor at the University of<br>Otago is earned off the back of years of<br>excellent teaching research and service<br>to the University and the wider<br>community those of you who know<br>professor Fitzgerald will know that she<br>is a gifted teacher she has given<br>immense service to the University and to<br>her professional community and she is an<br>outstanding researcher her work is both<br>internationally recognized in the<br>traditional academic sense but it is<br>also important forcing us to engage with<br>contemporary ethical issues in the area<br>of biomedical science and<br>practice she has written on health<br>policy health practitioners and people<br>with disabilities she is a pioneer in<br>research into the human impact of bio<br>technologies and has contributed to the<br>international debate on ethical issues<br>related to biomedicine and genetics her<br>work on morality and choice are central<br>to contemporary science and society I am<br>sure like me everyone in the audience is<br>very excited tonight about hearing more<br>about her work and about her journey so<br>professor Fitzgerald on behalf of the<br>University of Otago I would like to<br>personally congratulate you on your very<br>well earned promotion to Professor and<br>very shortly I will invite you to give<br>your inaugural professorial lecture but<br>before you speak I will first call on<br>professor Richard Walter the head of<br>department of archaeology and<br>anthropology who is going to tell us<br>just a little bit more about Ruth's<br>academic journey to Professor noreda<br>delicata America cultural Authority<br>Nepal<br>it's my great pleasure tonight to<br>introduce my colleague Ruth Fitzgerald<br>at this her inaugural professorial<br>lecture presenting an IPL is one of the<br>great and most significant events in the<br>careers of an academic and one to be<br>very proud of but academia is a<br>collective enterprise and I'd like to<br>signal here the pride we all have in the<br>Department of Anthropology seeing Ruth<br>here tonight mm-hmm Ruth's pathway has<br>been a somewhat circuitous one she was<br>raised in Gympie queensland an hour or<br>so north of brisbane and attended the<br>Queensland University of Technology in<br>Brisbane where she studied for a diploma<br>and applied science specializing in<br>radiation therapy this was the start of<br>a long commitment to the health sciences<br>that has become a core part of Ruth's<br>teaching and research today after his<br>studies in Brisbane Ruth moved to Sydney<br>and started a new career in radio<br>journalism as part of her career<br>development in that field<br>Ruth enrolled in a course on sound at<br>the Sydney University of Technology the<br>sydney university of technology is a<br>good Marxist university where the entry<br>qualifications emphasize comradeship as<br>as much as grades<br>it was it was while she was in Sydney<br>working in radio journalism that Ruth me<br>at her partner Martine was here<br>somewhere<br>and it was Martine who encouraged Ruth<br>to move here to Dunedin in Dunedin radio<br>journalism was not going to be enough to<br>keep the wolf from the door so Ruth<br>enrolled and graduate degree in<br>anthropology where she undertook a PhD<br>on the Anthropology of care that was in<br>our department Ruth has suggested to me<br>that there was some element of chance<br>and her choice of anthropology but<br>anyone who knows her work will<br>understand what an excellent and logical<br>choice that was throughout her previous<br>studies invocation<br>there are core interests around<br>communication experiences within the<br>health sector ethics of care that Social<br>Anthropology is perfectly served to<br>support after completing her PhD Ruth<br>began working with Hugh Campbell and the<br>newly established C safe and from there<br>transitioned into a lecturing position<br>in our department since taking on that<br>position in 2001 Ruth has been an<br>influential scholar and an inspirational<br>teacher Ruth was elected as a fellow of<br>the Royal anthropological Institute in<br>2009 she received the trainee hero a<br>medal from the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand in 2015 and has been a recipient<br>of more teaching and supervise<br>supervisory awards and I can list<br>including the University of Otago<br>excellence in teaching award in 2017 I<br>need say no more than to invite Ruth to<br>come forward to present a lecture this<br>evening<br>tena koutou tena koutou tena koutou<br>katoa<br>it's a real pleasure to be here with you<br>this evening and I just see it as in the<br>life of many teachers the assistant has<br>set this up not the way I'd like it but<br>I'm just going to keep working with it<br>okay I'm sure it'll work out in the end<br>okay as Richard said I've been a<br>long-term visitor here in Dunedin now<br>for twenty years it's wonderful to have<br>been such a happy guest here but my<br>journey comes to you from Australia I<br>was born in the hinterland of the<br>Sunshine Coast and this is the<br>traditional home of the Jinnah Bari and<br>the kabhi kabhi people and as you look<br>at this beautiful landscape I just like<br>to acknowledge their elders past and<br>present and the safe haven that my<br>family received there we've lived in<br>that area for about 130 years and the<br>pathways were from I think probably<br>escaping the potato famine in Ireland<br>through Birmingham and across and also<br>as refugees escaping civil war in<br>schleswig-holstein but my to talk with<br>you today concerns the research I've<br>conducted here at Otago as a guest of<br>Kai Tahu so I know before I talk to you<br>all I should explain just a tiny bit<br>about what anthropology really is and<br>how we do research so the sort of<br>anthropology that I study is called<br>cultural or social anthropology and<br>that's the study of people in all their<br>contemporary diversity here in the<br>current current time now one of the<br>defining aspects of our work as social<br>anthropologist is that we engage in<br>fieldwork and we call that ethnography<br>that means we go and visit other people<br>and their worlds to find out something<br>of how they make meaning in their lives<br>Olcott has spoken about this as engaging<br>in the three E's experiencing where<br>we're hanging out with people for long<br>periods of time examining where we<br>explore archives and popular<br>repositories of cultural information<br>that could be something as fleeting<br>perhaps as graffiti and enquiring an<br>extended continuum of communicating with<br>people it could be just everyday<br>over a long period of time it might be<br>very formal interviews where we record<br>our conversations and transcribe them<br>and talk about them in depth if we work<br>in very small short-term well-defined<br>little areas of research then and we're<br>not related to sort of furthering<br>anthropological knowledge and its broad<br>sense then we call our work borrowing<br>ethnographic techniques and my research<br>covers both of those fora and I study<br>the cultural worldviews of biomedicine<br>now in its broadest sense ethnography in<br>the words of Ruth Benedict is an effort<br>to make the world safe for human<br>difference and so anthropologists go to<br>a very great length to practice this<br>thing that we call cultural relativism<br>this is a perspective on societies that<br>tries to explain and understand them<br>from within the existing norms and rules<br>of those particular societies all of us<br>I think in our research lives reached<br>this point on a continuum of towards<br>cultural relativism where we draw a line<br>but we're hoping as anthropologists<br>we're going to travel a bit farther<br>along that trajectory before we wobble<br>off it that plus the sense that we're<br>always trying to communicate with people<br>to find out how what the aesthetics and<br>logics are of their own particular<br>worldviews that makes social<br>anthropology a great set of tools to<br>study contested and highly politicized<br>aspects of life and that's where all of<br>my research has been to date other words<br>we could apply to social anthropological<br>methods so that they're serendipitous<br>they're qualitative not always they're<br>slow that's when the funders are asking<br>us how things are going and they're not<br>representative of wider populations of<br>people so that's for all the studied<br>statisticians in the audience okay I did<br>my homework but they're rich and they're<br>insightful and they're just wonderfully<br>engaging if you like to read some of the<br>work that we produce so contemporary<br>anthropologists work then from a variety<br>of different subject positions and we<br>also always support this continuous<br>process of decolonizing our research<br>methodologies so the brief I was given<br>today to talk with you tonight was to<br>tell you a story about my research and<br>so I'm beginning with the PhD that I<br>conducted here at Otago<br>now as luck would have it that means I'm<br>going to talk to you about restructuring<br>but first staff here don't worry it's<br>not about a university it's actually<br>just about a hospital it's close but<br>it's not too close I'm hoping so we have<br>to go back in time then to the 1990s and<br>those of you that were here then it was<br>a really turbulent time for health<br>reform that was when we were<br>experiencing the retreat of the welfare<br>state in all these different areas of<br>our lives as citizens and it was quite<br>disturbing very briefly you might even<br>remember the government tried to<br>introduce fees for people who was being<br>treated in our State Hospital but old<br>age pensioners refused to pay those fees<br>and they did the you know the hospitals<br>to take them to court and in effect they<br>moralist shamed the government into<br>retreating from that policy of a very<br>very effective<br>to only lasted for three months even so<br>there was still this overwhelming sense<br>that money was drying up and services<br>were being lost and so patients in their<br>wheelchairs and hospital beds were<br>wheeled down the Main Street<br>to protest these cuts to our health<br>health care funding and I remember a<br>particular south Southland family who<br>had lost sadly one of their own members<br>while he was waiting to have stents as<br>surgery performed because he didn't have<br>enough points on the waiting list as<br>they were contriving the waiting list at<br>that particular point so he passed away<br>but his family got together and videoed<br>themselves singing an incredibly rude<br>song to the Health Minister of the time<br>Phil English and I remember Paul Holmes<br>Paul Holmes showed it good on him on the<br>current affairs program so in the midst<br>of all this public agitation then about<br>care I was working in the oncology unit<br>as a radiation therapist and I was<br>finding it all incredibly perplexing one<br>day the changes came to a head for me in<br>a very personal way I was treating a<br>young woman with cancer who had a wound<br>that needed constant dressing and the<br>wound needed to be covered with a<br>special dressing that was nonstick in<br>and had a layer of charcoal within it it<br>made it a very expensive dressing to buy<br>now in the resource rationed environment<br>that we were working in at the time I<br>wasn't supposed to offer her any<br>and I was I knew though at that time a<br>little of her circumstances and I knew<br>that she was really struggling to manage<br>to keep herself feeling comfortable and<br>clean over the weekend she couldn't<br>afford to buy all these dressings at the<br>chemist so I was treating her one<br>afternoon on a Friday and as I did so I<br>slipped across to our stock cupboards<br>and began stuffing some of these<br>bandages into a paper bag for her and<br>she's smarter thanks to me at the same<br>time as as luck would have it I could<br>hear the pop of the stiletto heels of<br>our manager walking around the corridor<br>right into the treatment area where we<br>were so moving as though we were one the<br>woman and I lurched together and put our<br>hands behind our back and I passed the<br>packages across into her waiting arms<br>while suspecting us mightily that<br>manager had been of human decency not to<br>actually frisk us in the room and so on<br>that day at least my patients<br>successfully made off with her loot at<br>the moment that time that was when my<br>PhD topic was really born to me because<br>as I stood there with burning cheeks<br>really because of this unvoiced<br>reprimand from the manager my mind<br>traveled back to 15 years before when<br>I'd been training as a young cadet<br>radiographer in Brisbane on a machine<br>treating people with similar sorts of<br>wounds that needed frequent dressing and<br>it was a Friday I'd been daydreaming and<br>I'd forgotten to give one of the<br>patients abandoned Lee a big bag of<br>bandages to last her over the weekend<br>the charger radiographer I still<br>remember her name and she frightens me<br>still mr. Pettigrew discovered my<br>oversight and she picked up a bag of<br>them and she threw them at me and said<br>go on after that patient you've<br>forgotten to give her those things run<br>after her and make sure she has some<br>changes over the weekend so off I went<br>for a kilometre uphill in 40 degrees<br>heat I was actually fitter than and I<br>gave them to the lady and but it was<br>really poignant to me because suddenly<br>everything was clear how could it be<br>that in a time span of only 10 or so<br>years everything had changed so much<br>that I was being reprimanded in the<br>1990s for doing what I had been<br>reprimanded for forgetting to do in the<br>1980s and so was that the only person<br>who was noticing these sorts of changes<br>what did other people think about it<br>so I went on to conduct fieldwork in<br>these hospitals over a year or so<br>interviewing a variety of workers both<br>managerial and IT and clinical workers<br>as well and always seeking out people<br>who were well known for excellence in<br>their sphere of endeavor and my question<br>that I was asking them seemed so very<br>very simple<br>what does Care mean to you as I<br>conducted the fieldwork I also took an<br>interest in understanding clinical<br>workers as much more broadly conceived<br>as perhaps you might at first think them<br>to be so I included orderlies and<br>receptionist for example as clinical<br>laborers all of these people I came to<br>understand practiced wonderful clinical<br>care to the very best of their abilities<br>you might wonder how it could be that<br>people who aren't trained in biomedicine<br>could become an expert carer but many<br>technical and service workers understood<br>their jobs as a calling and I vividly<br>remember a time and an electrician<br>turning up to me in tears tears running<br>down his face and he had come to fix the<br>x-ray warning lamp outside the room<br>where I was working and I said what<br>happened to you and he said I've just<br>been told I've been made redundant and I<br>said this is all for just go home he<br>said I'll no no no I know who these<br>people have cancer their situation is<br>much worse than mine of course I'll stay<br>I'll fix the lamp so from as I started<br>to understand it then this was a<br>characteristic of these sorts of workers<br>they understood their work as a calling<br>and as I started to talk to all this<br>diverse group of people I came to<br>understand there was the characteristic<br>demarcation in their responses to me and<br>this was the principal finding of the<br>research that the restructuring process<br>in the hospitals had bifurcated the<br>labor of care something that was once an<br>ideal that all the workers held together<br>uniformly had now been pressed apart<br>into two different types of care type 1<br>care that I called relational or<br>clinical care and type 2 that I called<br>abstracted or managerial astaire I'm<br>going to talk about that one first so<br>each side of this division swore that<br>the other side didn't care at all but as<br>I later understood they both cared<br>intensely but the object of their care<br>was very very different type to carers<br>cared for the system and type-1 carers<br>cared for their patients understanding<br>that the object of care can be very<br>different for two people in the same<br>situation is really important because it<br>authorizes completely different sets of<br>practices and interventions as to what<br>each person would imagine is the<br>rational response to somebody needing or<br>asking for care as I said abstraction<br>was the identifying quality of these<br>type two workers and here behind me<br>you've got an example of one of these<br>workers describing to you what it might<br>be like to be an average everyday sort<br>of patient in the hospital to look back<br>at that time it's to remember an<br>internal working environment that was<br>very very tense even in the 1990s there<br>were many academic papers that public<br>that explored the essential emotional<br>turmoil that accompanies restructuring<br>and it would be fair to say in the<br>hospital the situation was equally grim<br>for both sets of workers nobody was on<br>top for example it was well known if<br>you're an aspiring junior manager that<br>at the very most you had only three<br>years before either you were promoted or<br>you were simply you lost your job the<br>scrutiny these workers were under was<br>incredibly intense and there was this<br>ferocious pressure for them to complete<br>targets and to deliver new contracts all<br>the while maintaining an almost manic<br>kind of can-do attitude in response to<br>tasks hold down to them from their own<br>bosses often presented that publicly in<br>bullying and humiliating manner it's<br>also meant then that they worked so<br>intensely they often had to work through<br>the night and lots of times I would go<br>along to conduct an interview with<br>somebody only to find that they've been<br>up for 24 hours straight as they tried<br>to make one of these impossibly tight<br>deadlines and they then been sent home<br>to sleep because their other workers had<br>noticed them wandering around and<br>talking gibberish they might have been<br>avoiding the anthropologists but I don't<br>know they had a very very tough time of<br>it now the clinical workers also had a<br>very difficult time but they were time<br>pressure they were pressure in very<br>different ways what happened for them<br>was that time famines began to appear in<br>their working lives as redundancies were<br>made and their jobs were restore<br>children people were reallocated this<br>impacted on these clinical workers<br>capacity to provide the softer healing<br>centered and individualized emotional<br>responses that typifies there are<br>various styles of care work and this<br>slide is showing you something of the<br>orientation that these workers had to<br>their positions now the problem for<br>these clinical staff was that when you<br>looked at them in abstraction and<br>stripped of context and that was the<br>appropriate way to view them if he were<br>sitting as a high manager looking down<br>on the workforce when you did that it<br>seemed as though everybody was running<br>around doing exactly the same thing this<br>was providing a set of technical cares<br>with very high competency and then the<br>additional element of good customer<br>service from when the managers<br>understood it that um health care in<br>this way it seemed to be a really good<br>idea or a good omen for that seemed to<br>then be possible to reduce the workforce<br>save some money by replacing segments of<br>it with lesser trained assistants who<br>would learn by heart how to do simpler<br>procedures and then certainly just<br>reproduce them but they do it for lesser<br>wages but when you look in comparative<br>context as anthropologists always do<br>comparing one approach to the other side<br>you can see that the workers are doing<br>something that's quite different and<br>it's very difficult to actually explain<br>what it is what was mistakenly<br>understood by the type to care as the<br>managers as good customer service was<br>actually a type of emotional labor<br>something written about a decade earlier<br>by Ali Hawks child very briefly<br>emotional labor is the manner in which<br>we reach into ourselves to recall and to<br>re experience an authentic emotional<br>tone or an ambience in new and somewhat<br>inauthentic circumstances for instance<br>when we're at work perhaps in its deeper<br>sense you can think of it as method<br>acting an emotional labor absolutely<br>doesn't work unless it's conformed it's<br>performed absolutely convincingly okay<br>and each of those performances costs us<br>a great deal but it is how excellent<br>workers in the clinical situation avoid<br>treating their patients merely as<br>objects and as I said before it's the<br>vehicle for healing and other meaning<br>centered interventions into people's<br>lives it's also a sense of great<br>satisfaction and workers often saw it as<br>a reciprocal<br>arrangement that they offered emotional<br>labor and then people responded with<br>gratitude and they also the workers had<br>a sense that they work was meaningful so<br>I think of it as the element of artistry<br>in care work and it was produced out of<br>the fabric of every single individuals<br>life<br>it isn't easy in that case then to<br>substitute one type of worker for<br>another they have different lives that<br>they draw on nor can you substitute a<br>junior worker for a more experienced one<br>and there was no amount of roster<br>reorganizing the development of new care<br>pathways or any other such<br>rationalizations of the workforce effort<br>that was ever attempted that could<br>incorporate this clinical care and so<br>the efficiencies that the managers were<br>attempting to achieve constantly by<br>reorganizing and restructuring and<br>reconfiguring that were never achieved<br>this was because when the clinical<br>workers would time pressure beyond<br>endurance they would retreat into<br>providing only technical cares for their<br>patients with no emotional context this<br>is like responding to that idea of<br>premium non nocere first do no harm if<br>I'm absolutely frazzled I'll just make<br>sure that I don't hurt you of course<br>this reduced rather than increased the<br>superficial goal of customer<br>satisfaction nobody likes to be in<br>hospital and be treated just like a<br>widget as Nietzsche wrote in a prism 33<br>in the gay science and I think this is<br>really the nub of the problem suppose<br>that one assess the value of a piece of<br>music according to how much it could be<br>countered calculated put into formulas<br>how absurd such a scientific assessment<br>of music would be what would one have<br>comprehended understood or known about<br>it nothing absolutely nothing of what is<br>really music in it and so sadly although<br>there was a lot that was potentially<br>really similar between these different<br>approaches to care between the type 1<br>and the type 2 workers the animosity<br>between the groups was utterly<br>insurmountable to understanding each<br>group configured the other as the utter<br>demon of its own universe and neither<br>group would recognize that and in fact<br>it was both the system and the<br>relational carers who needed to improve<br>and enhance their caring Styles it was<br>going to be several years in fact before<br>the working environment became slightly<br>normal again but by that time I had<br>Don and I was working as a junior<br>lecturer in the anthropology department<br>so if there's anything that I learnt<br>from my experience of my PhD it was to<br>recognize the complexity of this thing<br>called emotional labor and the<br>expression of good care every single<br>worker who might have interviewed had<br>shamefacedly told me how on certain days<br>they had to fake an interest in their<br>clients and how they had learnt to do<br>this on their own without ever having<br>had a single lecture on the topic in<br>their working lives all of them thought<br>that they were the only person in the<br>world to be doing such a thing when in<br>fact everybody that I spoke to had had<br>to dig deep in their professional life<br>in order to figure out how to how to<br>manage this sort of emotional labour so<br>then I realized that emotional labour<br>was never written into any job<br>description and its qualities varied<br>with all the different professional<br>occupations there were different ways to<br>go about engaging in it so it's quite<br>delighted then in 2004 to see some media<br>debates in in New Zealand about this new<br>type of worker being brought to staff<br>rural health clinics in remote areas of<br>the South Island the rural nurse<br>specialists there's a lot of hype in the<br>media about whether or not these people<br>were many doctors or were they nurses<br>and also were there going to be any good<br>and I thought gosh I think I'm the only<br>person in the world who's investigated<br>Carrie Styles maybe I could answer that<br>question so if I went to talk to them<br>the nurses professional professional<br>association the nursing council weighed<br>in to this public debate and cause<br>there's actually quite a lot of dismay<br>for the nurses themselves by refusing to<br>recognise the existing postgraduate<br>qualifications that these workers had<br>and actually that was disturbing because<br>a lot of them had paid out of their own<br>pocket to study courses in internal<br>medicine and emergency medicine in order<br>to become more competent in their<br>practice but these weren't allowed to be<br>countered the New Zealand Medical<br>Association also found the flames of<br>this debate I definitely remember a<br>panic-stricken debate in our own med<br>school about whether these nurses would<br>have prescribing rights and would they<br>be well enough educated to active to be<br>able to prescribe safely and of course<br>that was reasonable to ask that question<br>because rural areas have large<br>populations of older people and they're<br>very young and they're really difficult<br>to prescribe for and from the nurses<br>position the the stakes were also high<br>if they were performing the same tasks<br>as junior doctors and quite a lot of<br>people said that they were then they<br>were doing so for very greatly reduced<br>pay and for pretty dreadful working<br>conditions so into this maelstrom of<br>competing discourses I set out to ask<br>these workers are you doctoring or are<br>you nursing in your practice so after<br>exploring beautiful cynic stretches like<br>this all around the country it was<br>actually quite a nice research project<br>in retrospect I came away with the<br>answer yes yes but the nurses still<br>understood themselves to be nursing but<br>they were being pressured quite<br>constantly towards adopting more<br>doctoring styles and they were resisting<br>them as well as they could and these<br>quotes that you've got up here as<br>showing them showing you how some of<br>them are being pressed to provide a sort<br>of upfront and more commanding emotional<br>labor that they weren't trained for that<br>they didn't particularly want to engage<br>in there was also problems in their<br>technical cares to where they were being<br>pressed to take up different positions<br>that was the art of conducting internal<br>examinations the need to prescribe at<br>the time that I did this study that was<br>managed through this kind of elaborate<br>doctor nurse Sharad conducted over the<br>telephone and also this reluctant<br>capacity to diagnose now the diagnosis<br>skills came in because these nurses I<br>would often receive acute presentations<br>of people quite significantly ill and<br>they would have to decide very very<br>quickly is this illness coming from a<br>medical position in which case I'm going<br>to have to get an ambulance and send<br>them to a local hospital or is that<br>something that needs surgical treatment<br>in which case I have to airlift them in<br>a helicopter to a Regional Hospital and<br>these nurses just stood at the crux of<br>this dilemma if they chose the<br>helicopter and it was wrong they used up<br>three or four months of the healthcare<br>service budget for their unit and they<br>felt very very drafted Lee exposed to<br>personal Sencha over this diagnosis and<br>some of them said about their position<br>that they were their professional status<br>was actually only as good as the last<br>diagnosis so as the project wound to its<br>close I saw that the concept of care was<br>actually very deeply political but I<br>also thought I was listening to people<br>describing how to be a good person in<br>the light of exchanging<br>spectators and duties for instance most<br>of the people that I spoke to had<br>arrived at nursing simply by accident<br>they happen to have been in a remote<br>area decided to live there and then<br>someone found out they were a nurse and<br>asked them to start the clinic so<br>acutely aware that if they refused to<br>accept this burden of responsibility<br>there was likely to be nobody else who<br>had come because there were beautiful<br>places but they were very very remote so<br>it was kind of a duty or an obligation<br>of care that they were expressing so I<br>became interested then to go further<br>into this area and to look at moral<br>reasoning so I've got a slide here just<br>showing you a quote from a French<br>theorist of practice Pierre Bourdieu<br>and his work has been fundamental to me<br>in understanding that link between<br>caring moral reasoning and personal<br>identity so time for a space if you're<br>in my 200-level class I'd ask you a<br>question now that you get one percent<br>for so I'm asking you I think what I'd<br>be asking about is like what is this<br>thing that links then what I've been<br>talking about caring with what I'm going<br>to talk about moral reasoning and for me<br>it's in this slide it's the embodiment<br>of that emotional labor and how you<br>weave it into your identity it's quite<br>important so by that stage I've met a<br>good bloke in biochemistry associate<br>professor Mike leg and we started<br>teaching and supervising together and<br>became very interested in what we saw as<br>this change in the nature of health care<br>in that a lot of biological scientists<br>were learning to move forward and go<br>into health care and though actually is<br>having to engage with clinical workers<br>with patients as well and we wondered<br>how were they doing when they tried to<br>shift across to become healthcare<br>workers and we chose an area that we<br>thought would be pretty relevant and<br>that was fertility laboratories or IVF<br>labs so we went off and interviewed a<br>lot of workers in these different<br>positions and their work was absolutely<br>fascinating to me because in these<br>laboratories good technical care is as<br>close to perfection as it's possible to<br>be workers would all tell me that while<br>it might be possible to perhaps keep<br>working in this area if you made one<br>mistake if you made two you were<br>unemployable and furthermore you<br>wouldn't even think of trying to get<br>another job<br>I was just struck with his flawless<br>technique and as it was part of their<br>carrying styles but their workers<br>themselves were completely uninterested<br>in it they just took it for granted<br>although this excerpt that you're<br>looking at here is showing you just how<br>hard won that final confidence in their<br>abilities really was but the scientists<br>instead were absolutely just gobsmacked<br>by this idea of emotional labour finally<br>they'd say after Mike and I had been<br>traveling around the country talking to<br>different groups of them that's the<br>reason for that feeling late at night<br>when I lie awake and I worry about the<br>fertility rate in our lab and I've got<br>to go and see mrs. X tomorrow and talk<br>to her about it so at least we that<br>performed a small public service we<br>thought for them but drawing on to this<br>other idea of moral reasoning this is<br>another thing that emerged as we were<br>talking to these workers and we found<br>from our shared conversations that a lot<br>of these workers had some ethical qualms<br>about the sort of clinical work that<br>they were engaging in for the<br>embryologists it was experienced as<br>these moments of compromise between what<br>they understood and clearly dearly<br>defended as the populations right to<br>have a freedom of choice and<br>reproductive matters and what they felt<br>was their own complicity because of<br>their specific expertise in creating<br>families they felt a little<br>uncomfortable with and this was of<br>course despite all their work being<br>completely fully ethically approved in<br>the labs and also just wanted to say<br>that the workers themselves never<br>revealed this to their patients that was<br>part of their emotional labor to<br>maintain this perfect composure even if<br>they had some internal misgivings what<br>those triggers might be for different<br>workers varied for example it might be<br>intergenerational donation of gametes<br>within the one family to create a<br>pregnancy it might perhaps be same-sex<br>couples<br>it was definitely deceitful heterosexual<br>relationships people very upset when<br>they sort of caught on to that and<br>occasionally the just that very wealthy<br>couple who was too cavalier in their<br>request to dispose of embryos others<br>just wondered quietly about whether or<br>not children would be happy in the sorts<br>of arrangements and partnerships they<br>were looking at now the scientists would<br>get themselves quite worked up about<br>this slide at night and then sort of<br>talk themselves back down again by<br>saying to themselves things like<br>what I do is just basic biology IVF is<br>just the routine culling that happens<br>anytime in the ordinary reproductive<br>cycle I'm not playing God and in<br>addition the clinic's provided really<br>well run group for ethical meetings<br>where people could work out collectively<br>their approach to very complex<br>requirements or requests for certain<br>types of IVF treatment but even so there<br>was always this niggle of concern<br>one scientist spoke to me about it in<br>this manner there are boundaries and<br>then one boundary gets pushed and then<br>the next case you come across it's like<br>well we did that last week and that was<br>case a well case B this week is like<br>that it's just a little bit different<br>and things though they seem to just be<br>sort of getting weirder and weirder as<br>they go along so while all scientists in<br>a positive sense thought that they<br>developed increased tolerances for a<br>wide variety of family structures by<br>doing this work that had been achieved<br>at some personal cost and some of this<br>was still unresolved from this and our<br>other work with cytogeneticist who<br>create the reports about fetal genetic<br>difference when you go after have an<br>amniocentesis when you're pregnant there<br>the scientists who create those results<br>for you we found they also had some<br>niggling concerns about the implications<br>of their work which again they didn't<br>speak to anybody their concerns were<br>that they felt the GPS they reported to<br>didn't understand the sorts of results<br>or their significance that they were<br>giving them but on that basis Mike and I<br>decided to investigate a little further<br>we were interested in how people were<br>starting to talk quite a lot about<br>prenatal genetic testing and we wondered<br>if we were hearing everybody's stories<br>it seemed as though perhaps we were not<br>our concerns were shared by a good<br>friend and colleague up at the North at<br>the University of Auckland professor<br>emeritus Julie Park and so we decided to<br>combine our research projects together<br>and add in a few new ones and this was<br>called the troubling choice Marsden<br>project I've just laid it out here<br>you'll speak to this in just a moment<br>but our questions for this research<br>we're how do people make decisions about<br>reproduction and the significance of<br>prenatal testing results in these<br>pressured times you know when people are<br>just given just only a few weeks to<br>understand the significance of the<br>results from these technologies link<br>that to the genetic map<br>makeup of the car that they're carrying<br>and they wonder how to be a good parent<br>in these circumstances and I think it's<br>particularly poignant because for a lot<br>of the sorts of genetic difference that<br>were being diagnosed that treatment<br>available was often simply to consider<br>termination so the metabolic disorders<br>there were some treatments but not for<br>many others so each box on this diagram<br>then is a little group of people that we<br>studied even the little ones and the<br>quite long ones within our wider<br>community and as we interviewed these<br>people were kind of interested to know<br>like what sensor people making of these<br>technologies some anthropologists has<br>written about IVF fertility treatment as<br>though were machine for managing hope<br>and PGD the embryo biopsy techniques<br>where you decide whether or not to<br>implant a particular embryo with a<br>particular genetic makeup they were seen<br>as mechanisms for expressing grief<br>because it was such an uncertain and<br>difficult path to follow so our thoughts<br>about genetic testing in New Zealand<br>when it's combined with that background<br>legislation that allows therapeutic<br>terminations of pregnancies was that the<br>effect of the Texas testing was to<br>create cultural meanings of disability<br>and actually this is what this diagram<br>is trying to show you so what we've done<br>is sort of a bit like a scatterplot<br>maybe we've put all these different<br>people we've been talking to on this<br>Square which is actually has to<br>Continuum's running across it so but the<br>horizontal line of difference on one<br>side we have medical models of<br>disability that's that sense that<br>disability is an error or something that<br>needs to be corrected or removed or<br>fixed right across to the more social<br>model of disability on your left-hand<br>side and this is when people think of<br>disability as just everyday ordinary<br>human difference we all have impairments<br>at different points in our life and in<br>fact it's society that's deeply<br>disabling and so we just placed all the<br>people were talking to about this idea<br>of genetic testing are on this continuum<br>now disability is just such a complex<br>phenomenon ok there's many more ways to<br>understand it and Beatson has said for<br>instance that it also forms part of our<br>identity and it's highly political and<br>one of the other Continuum's that we<br>were interested in looking at was<br>whether people what they thought in<br>private about it<br>what they were prepared to say in public<br>about it remember those embryologists<br>and the other scientists who sort of had<br>these ideas but they didn't voice them<br>so they're up the top at the very top at<br>the interviews I conducted with 60 women<br>around the South Island who had<br>conducted pregnancy terminations and a<br>lot of these interviews I was actually<br>the only other person this woman had<br>spoken to in her entire life so very<br>private conversations right down at the<br>bottom where people get on the computer<br>and write out a great a reporter or a<br>set of lists and demands to the<br>government and publish it on the web so<br>the point of that marsden project and<br>all that some work was to find an<br>empirically derived model of everyday<br>ethics that was specific to New<br>Zealand's cultural responses to the<br>dilemma of prenatal genetic testing this<br>slide is showing you now some of the<br>elements of this model that we've been<br>working on and we're still figuring it<br>out but some elements are still very<br>clear I think for instance a lot of<br>studies about ethical reasoning around<br>testing talked about this testing in the<br>present tense as though you gather a<br>conversation for a few different people<br>you figure out what sort of moral<br>reasoning Styles they're doing and<br>that's the end of it now you know<br>something about it but all of our work<br>has shown us the people's experience of<br>selfhood and thus decision making<br>changes deeply in the context of their<br>lives some families we spoke to for<br>instance absolutely refused to consider<br>a termination for their first child<br>diagnosed with a genetic disorder but<br>considered a very carefully indeed for a<br>second child because of the wish to<br>provide higher-level care for the<br>firstborn so they were sort of honoring<br>that contract that they had set up<br>initially with that first child it<br>wasn't that their views about right to<br>life perhaps the right to choose had<br>changed they had to honor that initial<br>contract so we argued after think<br>hearing a lot of stories like this that<br>this dichotomy is thinking about right<br>to life versus right to choose really<br>fails to capture the sorts of ethical<br>entanglements that emerged when you<br>speak to people who have actually had to<br>pass through these situations rather<br>than a universal quality of ethical<br>thinking we think that these terms<br>really reflect instead<br>popular cultural values from the United<br>States that transport rather poorly<br>across into our New Zealand environment<br>we think it's very to suggest that while<br>ideas of the right to choose are still<br>held very dear by certain segments of<br>the population in New Zealand not not by<br>everybody the notion is more about how<br>people are expressing this shared dream<br>of a culturally decent society as much<br>less an accurate expression of people's<br>decision-making around reproduction we<br>can then make sense of results that were<br>otherwise really quite complicated to<br>explain how many people would come into<br>interviews with us and say I absolutely<br>uphold women's rights to choose I want<br>you to remember that that's my position<br>on this and then recount in their own<br>words that they didn't have very many<br>choices at all and in fact what they did<br>whether they decided to terminate her or<br>not was the only thing possible in the<br>circumstances and I've argued elsewhere<br>that this sort of reasoning is more like<br>operating a set of tactics than a choice<br>now in contrast this is this is what<br>most people would say they had no choice<br>at all in contrast it was just one group<br>I don't know if you've heard of them are<br>not saving downs they're the group that<br>have argued that genetic testing<br>technologies prenatal testing<br>technologies there is a type of<br>state-sponsored genocide against people<br>with Down's syndrome here in New Zealand<br>they appear to be the only group that we<br>worked with who actually were trying to<br>exercise the right to choose and I just<br>need to say that but they would never<br>say that they personally would align<br>themselves more with the right to life<br>but as an analyst just listening to them<br>I saw that they were always trying to<br>exercise choice the choice to continue<br>with their pregnancies that was when<br>their fetuses had been identified with<br>Down syndrome in and in the face of very<br>persistent pressure from a variety of<br>medical practitioners to respond to that<br>by having a termination<br>now these stories came to us not only<br>from saving downs but from lots of other<br>people but remember a little bit of<br>homework for you remember I said<br>anthropology can't speak to populations<br>okay so it's this is just the views from<br>the medical specialists and GPS that<br>these people had spoken to there was<br>this general pressure towards a very<br>medicalised view of disability that it<br>had to be removed so we suggest then<br>like a better way of understanding<br>this sort of thinking is that New<br>Zealanders are operating a type of<br>cosmopolitan cosmopolitan vernacular of<br>the right to choose that's an oxymoron<br>that describes those situations where<br>people are all striving collectively for<br>this unified thing the good but the way<br>in which they're measuring it is very<br>very different so there's quite a lot of<br>variety and we've seen in our studies<br>lots of different types of ethical<br>reasoning ethics of care when families<br>try to look at everybody's situation<br>within their family before deciding<br>whether to terminate a pregnancy other<br>families that go on to to follow us sort<br>of virtue ethic where they're trying to<br>develop moral character and becoming a<br>good parent in these situations and then<br>groups like saving downs that draw on<br>rights discourses speaking even more<br>broadly internationally we found to that<br>there are different cultural locations<br>that create different local vernaculars<br>of what high are why and how to care the<br>ethical reasoning styles that we<br>uncovered in New Zealand and not for<br>instance the same as in Iceland where<br>for a short period of time the<br>government stopped funding prenatal<br>testing of fetuses in that Icelandic<br>study the population responded to this<br>by using private Lovett laboratories in<br>Reykjavik and for the several years of<br>their study Gottfried Stata and Aniston<br>found that absolutely no children were<br>born at all with Down syndrome in<br>Iceland people worked out an ethical<br>situation on their own that didn't offer<br>them a welcome nor do our results mimic<br>what was found in Finland where a study<br>by masochist shows that Finnish people<br>in the same situation resorted to<br>Facebook discussions with their intimate<br>group of Fae I don't know anything about<br>Facebook but I'm sure there's some way<br>you can make it so it's fairly intimate<br>okay so don't rely on me on how to do<br>this but these people would talk with<br>their intimate friends on Facebook and<br>work out like display the diagnosis get<br>different opinions people were put in<br>their two cents worth and everybody<br>would come to this collective decision<br>within the group and so this is what you<br>should do and these people would adopt<br>it and they would allow themselves to be<br>swayed from what they were originally<br>going to do to take on this this new<br>style now New Zealanders didn't work<br>like this they often kept their<br>decision-making to themselves and even<br>when they were publicly aligned with the<br>group that had a certain<br>orientation towards prenatal testing in<br>their own families they often worked<br>completely in a different way and that<br>cognitive dissonance was not a problem<br>for them all right well you've been very<br>good and you've been listening to some<br>hard and very tricky things about my<br>research so I want to give you a break<br>now ok so now we're going to do some<br>more lighthearted projects about<br>borrowing ethnographic techniques and<br>one of these projects is with Professor<br>Mary Thompson and we explored Otago<br>adolescence our views of oral health now<br>while the research assistants on this<br>project laboured fairly mightily in<br>various classrooms around the province<br>to ask these secondary school students<br>some serious questions about oral health<br>as I watched and I listened to the<br>recordings I was struck by how much<br>whispering and note-taking was going on<br>during these sessions their students<br>kept muttering the topic was gay gay<br>Glee now not understanding the term<br>actually I do understand it quite well<br>but not in this particular context good<br>you're still awake that's good<br>I'd rather full heartedly ask my first<br>year class at the time for its meaning<br>and I received a small avalanche of<br>rather rude emails the best of which is<br>still burned into my brain it's when an<br>old fart like you keeps asking boring<br>questions of young people like us about<br>something as stupid as this now the<br>truth of course is always enlightening<br>ok although a little bruising but my<br>class was very startled the next week<br>too for me to tell them about this<br>answer and should give whoever that<br>anonymous person was my very sincere<br>thanks because of course we went on to<br>publish a really nice paper about the<br>gayness of oral health and we were<br>confident in the knowledge that we had<br>achieved that holy grail of anthropology<br>the insider's view of the phenomenon<br>from an unimpeachable source i'll just<br>tell you about one more project that i'm<br>working on right now which is the<br>undergraduate friendship project and so<br>this is a study of it combines my<br>interest in teaching ethnographic<br>methods with the study of friendship<br>friendship is a particular type of human<br>relatedness that was seen once in<br>opposition to kinship but now as<br>understood as something rather more<br>similar<br>and the research project is actually a<br>methods course and it's an example of<br>these more collaborative group focused<br>styles of teaching and learning we're<br>trying to promote in social anthropology<br>to help our students develop that<br>Graduate attribute of teamwork and<br>collaboration using my second-year<br>students as honorary research assistants<br>I see some up there now we set out every<br>two years and down the front to conduct<br>interviews with students other students<br>about the meaning of friendship so about<br>40 interviews we analyze them together<br>collectively and I work as the group's<br>principal investigator<br>I started it to be honest on a whim and<br>because I thought friendship might be<br>something that students would engage<br>with but over the last six years I'm<br>absolutely just astounded at what a rich<br>and fertile complex topic it really is<br>and it relates beautifully to these<br>other things I studied all my life like<br>carry cipro city tactics and finely<br>attuned moral reasoning so I've just got<br>a couple of ideas for you as teaching<br>the teachers and the audience that you<br>might like to know about from this study<br>and we regularly hear stories about<br>students coming into varsity and<br>switching their major to one that<br>they're not interested in at all because<br>they want to study with a friend also we<br>see them giving us accounts of coming<br>into class ready to participate in class<br>standing at the door looking in and<br>finding nobody that they know to sit<br>with and so they turn around and walk<br>away and a lot of stories from really<br>lovely young people who are missing out<br>on classes and assignments in order to<br>look after a friend who has often some<br>pretty significant mental health issues<br>so how can I it's used with permission<br>everybody so how can i bundle all of<br>this talking up this evening into<br>something that's contemporary to our<br>worlds well I guess one of the take-home<br>messages from my own journey of research<br>has been that engaging in care we're<br>placed in situations where we need to<br>decide on the tactics that we're going<br>to follow in these various very<br>complicated predicaments in which we<br>find ourselves<br>tactics are not the same thing as<br>choices they have less options they're<br>framed by the context of our lives<br>they're thrown together from what is at<br>hand they do have the advantage<br>being fluid and being able to be<br>modified in an instant<br>also remember people in different<br>circumstances select different objects<br>of care and so our tactics vary greatly<br>to the extent that while a lot of us<br>care deeply we often do so across<br>purposes to each other<br>skillful carers will try to navigate<br>these gulfs and find some modus vivendi<br>where most of us can tolerate the<br>conditions of our living as we try to<br>prosper those elements of our lives that<br>we care about most deeply it seems to me<br>that education is offering us today some<br>of these dilemmas on how to behave well<br>in defining the object of our care and<br>looking for tactical responses as much<br>as health care did in the 1990s<br>very recently for instance all the<br>academics in this room and across the<br>nation participated in the latest PBR F<br>around which is an auditing exercise in<br>which the government tries to measure in<br>an abstracted manner the quality of the<br>care that we attach to our research and<br>really foolish would any of us have been<br>or are institutions to have not<br>contributed to this assessment of the<br>state of health of our system it seems<br>to be that you have to keep nourishing<br>the system with more data so that we can<br>release funding for these relational<br>person-to-person aspects of our teaching<br>and research which we value so highly<br>the extracted views of such an audit of<br>course necessitates obscuring these<br>interpersonal collaborative and I think<br>artistic elements of the processes of a<br>functioning and engaged productive<br>University so here are a few more names<br>that I would have put on the PBR F<br>system if it allowed me to have a<br>co-authored portfolio I want to thank<br>all of the administrative assistants and<br>specially I'm remembering Claire Phipps<br>who was our departmental manager so long<br>ago I entered into the course in<br>anthropology when we had year-long<br>courses and believe it or not they let<br>me in halfway through the year so half<br>the assessments had already gone and<br>they still let me join and Claire just<br>knew my name she collected bits and<br>pieces of the things she thought might<br>be useful she just handed them to me one<br>day and said oh this might help you<br>so here her job description was the<br>administrator and there you go she was<br>this wonderful teacher I'd also like to<br>thank our graphic artist Leonie on that<br>beautiful artwork of the Marsden was his<br>work and of course you're a successful<br>grant writer thank you for that<br>work and Heather Sadler sitting there<br>for doing all this diabolically complex<br>IT networking that I always invent for<br>my methods classes and one of the<br>students here is remembering how hard<br>they are thank you those teaching awards<br>we're sharing them I'd like to thank<br>Simon who and les O'Neal and the central<br>library staff Siobhan and Lisa and also<br>Tricia Robbins for supporting our<br>national social anthropology journals<br>sites you've helped us publish hundreds<br>of peer-review articles for New Zealand<br>and overseas academics and I know for<br>sure that some of them were written<br>about in the PBRs round and also Thank<br>You Paula hustla for finding those<br>fantastic books for research and<br>Christie Paterson for finding all those<br>films for teaching at short notice and I<br>really want to commend the both of them<br>for perfection in emotional labor by<br>never once telling me I was a silly<br>duffer when I urgently wrote saying I<br>really need this book I need it now and<br>they write back and say yeah it's in the<br>library so I'd like to close my talk<br>this evening with my formal<br>acknowledgments to research participants<br>colleagues and funders thank you all so<br>very much for your presence this evening<br>any a kind attentiveness to this talk<br>clinical Couture my name is Tony<br>Valentine and on the PVC humanities here<br>at the University it is with great<br>pleasure that I'll deliver a vote of<br>thanks to professor Fitzgerald she has<br>delivered an excellent lecture a lecture<br>has reflected on her own professional<br>and academic pathway the nature of<br>anthropology as a discipline and the<br>centrality of care and caring and who<br>work now this evening she's explored<br>caring in a number of its dimensions and<br>she has challenged us to enlarge our<br>sense of and understanding of what<br>caring is to understand its range as<br>complexity and what she describes as its<br>artistry these are really important<br>arguments for us in a society where<br>caring is often undervalued both in an<br>economic and a social sense at the same<br>time as we grapple with questions around<br>the pay and working conditions of nurses<br>and carers and we discuss the extent of<br>the state support for or lack of support<br>for respite care investment advisors to<br>help retirement homes and assisted<br>living facilities as great places to<br>invest the divergence between those two<br>meanings of investment one emotional or<br>moral and the other monetary couldn't be<br>more clear and it's against that<br>cultural landscape that Ruth's lecture<br>has encouraged us to expand our sense of<br>the ecology of caring and to think more<br>broadly and carefully about cultures of<br>care our arguments have been anchored in<br>Ruth's own ethnographic experiences an<br>ethnographic researcher but her prior<br>knowledge and experience as a<br>radiographer as well and of course as an<br>ethnographic researcher she has a very<br>sharp eye for the human dynamics of how<br>institutions and health systems operate<br>there professor Fitzgerald has the<br>that are thoughtful and engaging lecture<br>is not surprising<br>she is quite simply an outstanding<br>teacher she has held an extremely high<br>regard by her students because she<br>supports their learning as they grapple<br>with some of the weighty cultural issues<br>and analytical questions that is she<br>that she has laid out this evening but<br>professor Fitzgerald is also a great<br>teacher because she cares<br>she and acts and ethos of thoughtful and<br>respectful care for her students and<br>their intellectual development and if<br>you spend even a small amount of time<br>with Ruth you get a very strong sense of<br>her deep commitment to teaching and<br>learning and her tremendous generosity<br>so professor Fitzgerald we have greatly<br>appreciated your lecture and we have<br>really enjoyed coming together to join<br>in this celebration of your promotion so<br>could you please join me in thanking and<br>congratulating Ruth<br>I have a gift to present to her and<br>after that I will encourage you all to<br>join us in the staff club for a<br>reception<br>you</p></main><footer
