I always<br>bring to that academic world my own<br>personal experience if I can relate it<br>to events or tales or you know things<br>that went wrong or right I'm equally<br>comfortable in putting what I didn't do<br>and what went wrong as I am with what<br>went right and fact the biggest learning<br>in life comes from when you make<br>mistakes so the knowledge sharing from a<br>personal share point<br>I will deliberately attempt to put on<br>the table things that didn't go as well<br>as they should have and then justify and<br>have a look and tear them apart with a<br>view to how could I have made that right<br>so I do it from a personal point of view<br>third thing in that forum that I always<br>attempt to do is to create a very safe<br>working environment ask people for<br>absolute confidentiality Chatham House<br>Rules apply there will be no discussion<br>no disclosure about anything specific to<br>an organization so that we can have a<br>safe room in open up discussion and<br>people can put their organisation under<br>a bit of scrutiny so that we can learn<br>with a hands-on approach to a real thing<br>rather than just deal with some academic<br>component<br>next component I always attempt to do is<br>to find a way to see if we could have a<br>number of workshops preferably at least<br>two per session so that before per day<br>at 8:00 over a two day session with a<br>view to experimentation and trolling and<br>utilizing the tools and practicing<br>you'll never get skilled in the use of<br>those tools but at least you'll have an<br>opportunity to apply them it will open<br>up your mindset to boy there's an<br>opportunity here and I should take grip<br>it up so the workshops too experienced<br>to utilize to practice and to learn to<br>start the journey on how to use the<br>tools in a profound manner the other<br>thing that I think we want to do is to<br>create a very safe forum for people to<br>have open discussion open dialogue and<br>to put on the table exactly the<br>situation that they face and so<br>frequently we don't have those forums<br>that are safe in order to do that but I<br>tend to create an environment in which<br>that's very safe to put on the table and<br>utilize the team to actually tackle that<br>issue so it's not uncommon in a room to<br>have people put up their own<br>organization but there was an absolute<br>binding rule that no one takes away from<br>the forum anything that they could quote<br>about any specific organization and<br>lastly I think how I attempt and have<br>been renowned for trying to do this as I<br>keep an agile approach and I make sure<br>it's adaptable and I don't start with<br>the premise that I've got a bunch of<br>notes and we just need to forward in<br>fact frequently I can dispense with the<br>notes altogether but being agile<br>adaptable and be able to play around the<br>audience read them acknowledge what they<br>are seeking and devote time and energy<br>to it and if that means making a few<br>compromises and let's do so because it's<br>about engagement it's about people<br>participating it's about how to get a<br>delivery that focuses on their<br>requirement not on what I'm attempting<br>to do so in style that would be about<br>the knowledge skill transfer the<br>opportunity for discussion and dialogue<br>and openness in a completely safe manner<br>the ability to practice the skill sets<br>associated with it and to learn how to<br>do it and to leave the room with some<br>confidence in the ability to execute<br>some of the things<br>we have put in place not all that's<br>impossible but to have a counselor with<br>attempting a few things on return to the<br>workplace so that would be the style<br>elements that I would put in place an</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
