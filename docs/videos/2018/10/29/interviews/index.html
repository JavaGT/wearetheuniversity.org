style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>to prepare for interviews you really<br>need to understand what you're going to<br>be asked you can go to your Career<br>Service for a list of potential<br>questions or common questions that<br>interviewers might pose to you after<br>that I would advise that you prepare<br>some answers or think about your six top<br>stories or really positive things that<br>you've achieved that you want to<br>employer to know about you from that you<br>can then go away and practice with<br>family or friends or your career service<br>to make sure that when those questions<br>come you're prepared for them and you<br>can answer them very succinctly and very<br>confidently preparing for interviews I<br>think is one of the most important<br>things to do so making sure that you are<br>researching about a company do you know<br>you don't have to know the ins and outs<br>of what the company do but look at their<br>career site look at some of the social<br>media posts you could even research the<br>person if you know who's going to be<br>interviewing you that preparation is<br>really key look at the company website<br>look up whoever's interviewing you read<br>news articles about either the company<br>or the department or the industry that<br>you're going to be working in make sure<br>that you have something valuable to<br>understand and bring to the table when<br>you go in also practice if you can<br>practice for an interview even though it<br>feels silly at a kitchen table across<br>from your parents you will feel a lot<br>calmer when some of those questions do<br>pop up in a room and you feel under<br>pressure how you should prepare<br>specifically for 0 I would personally<br>recommend making sure that you<br>understand what our values are we have<br>five of them I'll let you go look those<br>up yourself but if you can sit there and<br>have a real think about what your values<br>are personally and then align those to<br>our values you're going to feel a lot<br>more comfortable when you walk in the<br>room because it does matter to us that<br>whoever comes on board really<br>understands who we are and wants to be a<br>part of it your interview is probably<br>the most important presentation that<br>you'll have to make<br>so you need to be prepared and that<br>comes worth researching the company<br>researching the industry but most<br>importantly really knowing yourself<br>knowing your CV<br>knowing your work experience inside an<br>art as well as your strengths and any<br>areas where you feel you maybe need to<br>develop or improve and again preparing<br>to answer questions and also preparing<br>behavioral questions really do what it<br>says on the tin we're looking to assess<br>your behavior so how you have acted in<br>the past and how you will probably<br>continue to act in the future something<br>that students often forget to include at<br>this stage is an example so if somebody<br>says to you tell me how you act in a<br>team we don't just want some descriptive<br>words so I like collaborating and I like<br>being the leader we're looking for a<br>story so again the what the how or the<br>why or perhaps you can use a star format<br>that you might have heard of before it's<br>a situation the task the action and the<br>result don't forget that this is your<br>one big chance to shine and to sell<br>yourself so you should always include as<br>much detail as possible to really bring<br>your behavior to life and make us want<br>I think my favorite question with the<br>interview is probably the one that<br>students dread the most<br>and that's tell me about yourself at the<br>beginning because it's really vague and<br>you can do what you want with it and<br>that's exactly why I like it you have<br>complete creative control to take that<br>in whatever direction you want so it<br>gives you the chance to tell them your<br>best story straight away to make them<br>really impressed with you from the first<br>minute that you're talking after all<br>science and research tells us that<br>people make a decision about whether or<br>not they like you or whether or not they<br>want to hire you very very quickly at<br>the start of the interview so in the<br>tell me about yourself question I would<br>be looking for something similar to your<br>motivational statement or personal<br>statement on your CV so a snapshot of<br>who you are your work experiences your<br>extracurricular experiences your<br>education so what's your degree<br>background and then what you're looking<br>for out of your career and how ey and<br>this role that you've applied for can<br>fulfill that my favorite questions<br>initially the opening questions are<br>always really valuable for me and the<br>questions where it's you know talk<br>through talk me through your CV and<br>because somebody who is talking about<br>themselves and their career history you<br>know that they're telling a story it's<br>interesting you learn about this person<br>you learn about where they've been what<br>they've been doing and yeah I think for<br>that so I guess they open in their<br>initial getting to know someone in the<br>interview so personally for me I<br>interview based on soft skills so I've<br>got a couple of favorite questions my<br>absolute favorite question is to ask<br>what did you do to prepare for this<br>interview someone answers that question<br>about what they did to prepare for the<br>interview they're telling me how much<br>they want the job they're telling me the<br>extra effort that they went to to make<br>sure that they would be somewhat<br>successful and it also gives them an<br>opportunity to tell me what kind of<br>person they are<br>are they proactive do they go out and<br>seek information or do they get it from<br>other sources I'm always interested to<br>see who's really passionate I have gone<br>and I've asked some technical leads what<br>their favorite technical question is<br>and I've got two your favorite two and<br>then another one was what technology do<br>you use to have fun so they've both kind<br>of defined that in the way that they<br>want to know whether you've got a<br>genuine passion for coding or technology<br>when it comes to development whether<br>it's something you do at home<br>in your own time and also if there's<br>something that you've gone<br>uninvestigated outside of your studies<br>so that's always cool to look at so I<br>might one of my favorite questions as to<br>ask candidates I mean something's gone<br>horribly wrong and it's quite<br>interesting to bit whom horribly wrong<br>is quite subjective but I want to know<br>there is an asset question is when<br>something did go wrong how did you cope<br>with it<br>how did you manage how did you come face<br>there and what was the result so show us<br>how resilient you are is kind of where<br>I'm going with that question but it's<br>one it always it's don't some people but<br>when I like to ask so the question I<br>most like asking students is asking them<br>to talk through a team project that they<br>are currently working on or have either<br>worked on and what challenges have they<br>faced throughout that project and then<br>diving a little bit deeper into that so<br>asking them about how they would do<br>things differently if they had the<br>chance - my favorite questions to ask in<br>an interview are firstly tell me about<br>yourself because it gives us a chance to<br>build rapport and break the ice it also<br>tells us more than you think it does so<br>if you know you tell us that you have<br>been part of a sports team for a long<br>period of time you've actually gone into<br>coaching we can see that you're<br>committed you're dedicated you've got a<br>passion for something and that is really<br>indicative of the sort of person that<br>you are and it will help us see a few<br>values and your goals aligned with us as<br>a company a second favorite question<br>would be what do you know about<br>mainframe because it really weeds out<br>the people who've done the research and<br>those who haven't so if you can tell us<br>you know we're a global company what our<br>different divisions are of different<br>services that's great and it does show<br>that you've done the research but we<br>have had one candidate who kind of blew<br>me out of the water really when I asked<br>her what do you know about Maine Freight<br>and she said I know that every year you<br>hold a Maine Freight Idol so like<br>American Idol we all get together oh I<br>knew anyone who wants to toe can come<br>together and be part of this main<br>Freight Idol competition and she said<br>that one day she would love to be part<br>of the competition and then when I asked<br>her what she'd sue she said she'd<br>actually wrapped Nicki Minaj so<br>immediately I you know really warmed to<br>this this girl that it was amazing that<br>she had managed to dive so far into her<br>research that she found something that<br>is very much just an internal event the<br>third question that I like to ask us why<br>main Freight because that helps us<br>understand where your values and your<br>goals in your career direction are going<br>and whether they align with main<br>freights goals and direction as well<br>I forget a turkey question don't panic<br>so if you get offered a drink at the<br>interview the beginning interview always<br>ask for one always take the water<br>because when you get the turkey question<br>you take a sip of water and you have<br>time to think about it if you've had<br>your drink of water and you still can't<br>think of an answer then don't be afraid<br>to say the interviewer hey I've had a<br>little bit of a mind late do you mind if<br>we come back to that one most interviews<br>won't have a problem with that so don't<br>panic is the key piece of advice in that<br>regard there will always probably be a<br>few tricky questions coming up in<br>interviews so it's really important to<br>take a deep breath you can pause for a<br>moment make sure you're telling your<br>interviewer that you are doing that and<br>ask them to repeat the question if you<br>don't understand something it's really<br>important to get that Christian across<br>or get their answer across in the right<br>way so every interviewer likes to ask<br>tricky questions so before you answer<br>it's good to stop have a think about<br>what they've actually asked you make<br>sure that you understand the question<br>and it's completely fine to ask them to<br>rephrase it or or say the question again<br>the last thing you want is to start<br>talking before you've properly<br>understood it<br>asking questions at the end of the<br>interview is often something that's<br>overlooked by people who are new to the<br>process and it can be a really important<br>part of the decision-making process for<br>the interviewer because it shows us how<br>hungry you are for the role and your<br>level of engagement is really important<br>in us deciding if we want to offer you a<br>role so I would use that opportunity to<br>ask the interviewer about the company<br>and their career journey ask them about<br>the business area you're applying to and<br>about the role that you're going to be<br>going in to ask them about future<br>opportunities there's no such thing as a<br>stupid question as long as you've done<br>your research first of all and you<br>balance it all the easy questions about<br>you I for instance don't go in there<br>asking them you know what parts of the<br>business there are because you can look<br>at that on the internet and we want to<br>see that you have done some research<br>before you come into the interview so<br>yeah good solid questions that you can't<br>get the information off the internet are<br>always a winner in my opinion ask the<br>interviewer insightful questions three<br>things that interviewers judge a<br>candidate on our candidates first<br>impression the quality of your answers<br>but also the quality of your questions<br>so the best questions focus on what<br>impact does my role have on the business<br>and maybe what challenges would I face<br>in my role<br>another good question to ask an<br>interviewer is what are the major<br>performance expectations of me in this<br>position and they maybe talk to some<br>past experiences that relate to to the<br>job it can really vary depending on how<br>the interview goes but if you've done<br>your research and you've come across<br>something that you're not a hundred<br>percent sure on this is a great<br>opportunity to ask us for some<br>clarification whether it be on our<br>program on our business goals and again<br>it shows us that you've done that<br>research but you just you know you want<br>a little bit more clarification it's<br>also quite good to ask the interviewer<br>their experience with the company if you<br>do that you can see how they have<br>progressed you can also see<br>why they enjoy being part of the company<br>so you can kind of get an idea of<br>whether it is some way that you want to<br>be so it kind of you know works both<br>ways<br>the interviewer would like to hear<br>Christians that show you've done some<br>research but also your interests so<br>coming to Deloitte and wanting to know<br>what the team looks like the structure<br>social occasions what we do outside of<br>our everyday but showing a lot of<br>interest in what we do on a day to day<br>basis not just about it being working<br>for Deloitte not being blinded by their<br>brand so wanting to know what the day to<br>day looks like and being really keen to<br>understand how the team operates and<br>what they do so in terms of asking the<br>interviewer questions and I am a firm<br>believer that interviews are a two-way<br>street<br>and so you are although you are being<br>interviewed by KPMG for example this is<br>your chance to ask questions of us and<br>your chance to find out about the social<br>life it's your chance to find out about<br>the culture and ask the questions that<br>you want to know about and don't ask<br>questions that you think we want to hear<br>because we want to get genuine answers<br>and responses from you as well at the<br>end of an interview the interviewer will<br>always ask you if you have any questions<br>this is a great chance to ask that<br>career progression ahead of the<br>interview you may even be provided with<br>the interviewers name so it's a great<br>chance to look them up on LinkedIn find<br>out what their role is in the company<br>and even ask them if they have any<br>guidance for you for your future career<br>so the best way to build rapport in an<br>interview is to ask questions to be<br>yourself tries to be relaxed if you've<br>prepared well for the interview you'll<br>be confident and you can ask the<br>interviewer about their role in the<br>business and obviously when you get<br>someone talking about themselves it<br>starts to build rapport you're asking<br>questions<br>so to wear to an interview it's<br>important to be professional again if<br>you're not sure just ask that question<br>of the HR person or whoever you've been<br>dealing with ever fish and Paco have<br>gear we don't wear ties or we don't wear<br>suits so we make sure that we let our<br>interviewees know or our candidates know<br>and be comfortable with what you're<br>wearing I think it's really important<br>also to make sure your iron your clothes<br>and that's a big yes so it's really<br>important to remember to dress<br>professionally for an interview dress<br>for the employer obviously if you're<br>applying for a graphic design role the<br>the dress attire might be slightly<br>different to a professional services<br>company so do your research but it's<br>always important to be very professional<br>and neat so in terms of what to wear for<br>an interview and gentlemen should wear<br>and suit suit and tie and women should<br>be the same so and far more business<br>attire at all times I would say an<br>interview it's common for men to wear<br>ties but on a daily basis anyway people<br>are just in the office then ties on that<br>usual mallesh are going out to client<br>site I think with weddings as well it's<br>better to over dress and under dress so<br>yeah I would I would just play it safe<br>and wear a tie yep yes I do think a suit<br>and tie is appropriate we're looking at<br>you and you come in for interview<br>there's that first impression that was<br>Deloitte as can we put you in front of<br>our client so how did you choose to<br>present yourself to us and it's really<br>important so yes I do think a suit and<br>tie you can never go wrong with a<br>my top three tips I suppose for<br>interviewing are to be relaxed be<br>yourself it's super difficult to achieve<br>that but if you practice I promise it<br>does get easier and easier a way to<br>overcome those nerves and my second tip<br>would be to really know yourself so you<br>are a product you you have a brand that<br>you're trying to sell to the employer to<br>ey so you need to know exactly what you<br>have to offer and what you're looking<br>for so with the interviewer you can<br>determine if there's a match there<br>between the supply and demand you're<br>discussing so know what you have to<br>offer and then know what the things are<br>that are attracting you to ey and then<br>you can talk about why you would be a<br>good fit and why you would be good for<br>the business and a great long-term<br>employee thirdly I would encourage you<br>to work on your rapport or networking<br>building and so your networking skills<br>relationship building skills this is<br>often something that students can<br>struggle with because they've not had<br>much experience of this so come to speed<br>networking sessions come to employer led<br>workshops and just be comfortable with<br>being outside of your comfort zone and<br>talking to strangers as I have mentioned<br>before you will be working with the<br>people who are interviewing and<br>assessing you at the Assessment Center<br>and in the interview so they just want<br>to see if you're going to be able to do<br>the job well but are we going to have<br>fun working together are we going to get<br>the best out of our team dynamic and<br>rapport is a really big part of that and<br>other things that I think students need<br>to know about an interview is you know<br>it is a chance for you to learn as well<br>it is a learning experience it's a<br>chance for you to come in and be in a<br>bit you know being a formal and<br>professional environment and see what<br>that is like and I would also suggest<br>that you and definitely do some research<br>beforehand and research the building<br>things like if you're going to drive<br>where are you going to pack and arrive<br>early but don't arrive too early that<br>it's gonna really impurity the<br>recruiters and you know if you have an<br>interview at 3 o'clock you know 5 to 3<br>is a perfect time to turn up at<br>reception just a little things like that<br>three other recommendations when it<br>comes to interview don't be too early<br>and<br>be too late too early so it looks like<br>you can't manage your time and too late<br>well that's obvious so be here about 10<br>minutes before you introduce Joe that's<br>fear unless you've been asked to come<br>and earlier to do paperwork and things<br>like that if you find yourself outside<br>the office half an hour before head go<br>find a coffee shop go for a walk go do<br>something but don't show up too early<br>because it's really awkward for the<br>reception that's why you sit there for<br>half an hour waiting for your interview<br>everybody feels a little bit awkward so<br>don't come in - really it's probably one<br>of my key things for you a key thing you<br>should do before going in for interview<br>is making sure your phone is turned off<br>not on silent turned off it's really<br>distracting not just for the interview<br>but for you as well so you might be<br>mid-flow and that goes off many time<br>have been an interview where the phone<br>is actually run and what that see is by<br>you leaving it on is that maybe we're<br>not as important to you as what's coming<br>through on that phone so turn it off if<br>you're serious about coming to work for<br>us just make sure you take a deep breath<br>before you go in no matter how many<br>times you have gone for an interview<br>there is always an element of nervous so<br>you can ask for for water a few if<br>that's going to make you feel more<br>comfortable make sure you go to the<br>bathroom or go to the toilet before so<br>that you are fully comfortable within<br>that an to term presentation is<br>everything I've had a candidate kind of<br>rock up and the first thing I noticed<br>when he sat down was that he was chewing<br>gum and immediately my mind is taken off<br>what he's saying because all I can see<br>is that the white piece of gum rolling<br>around in the mouth and we won't be<br>afraid to tell you to spit it out<br>because it is actually you know it's<br>unprofessional and it's distracting<br>another thing is it is key that you've<br>done your research because it shows us<br>that you're motivated and that you<br>actually want to be here interviewing<br>with us and lastly it's really important<br>just to be yourself because when you<br>come in to your role<br>that's who you're going to be so we want<br>to see your person<br>we want to see the real you so it's<br>really important in an interview to be<br>yourself tries to build rapport with the<br>interviewer if you can ask questions do<br>your research and if possible try to be<br>employers that align with your career<br>goals as well and your career objectives<br>because your enthusiasm and passion is<br>going to come through in the interview<br>three other tips for nailing your<br>interview would be one firm handshake it<br>needs to be firm it's always such a good<br>impression if you can hold someone's<br>hand without dominating them but make<br>sure it's there you've got some<br>substance to arrive early not too early<br>but 10 to 15 minutes is always good and<br>it gives you an opportunity to breathe<br>while you're sitting outside if you<br>arrive on the dark flusters you're going<br>to be off your balance the moment you<br>walk in and it's going to be pretty<br>nervous so if you can arrive early<br>you'll definitely do well and number<br>three I would say act interested if<br>you're interested be interested if<br>you're engaged being engaged if you're<br>leaning back in your seat with your body<br>language you're not interested don't<br>look out the window when you're talking<br>to someone I contact it's really<br>important the difference between someone<br>talking to you while they look out the<br>window and the difference to somebody<br>leaning forward and using hands get<br>stirs making eye contact and really<br>trying to get their point across as the<br>difference between a good answer and a<br>bad answer you could have the best<br>answers in the world but if you're<br>answering in a way that gives off the<br>wrong impression you're not going to do<br>well<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
