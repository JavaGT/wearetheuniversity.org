supply chain.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we recently set up as part of a lens<br>identity to support a piece of work<br>there's kotahi there was a large move<br>relations right and what elements it up<br>with with Fonterra who's decided to get<br>rid of the biggest chefs I think most<br>people here to probably know the big<br>shift story I'll go a little bit through<br>patience no now have all of them goes to<br>create a more efficient thanks on the<br>glue so that defenders shipping would be<br>good all right and here we go that a I<br>guess there's three major strategies<br>where we're doing in faith us around the<br>country just and we're running<br>we're running warehousing and we're<br>running transporter business which is<br>really good Frank coordination business<br>with lots of different customers and we<br>bring them together and so on and I<br>create an efficient supply chain like<br>you Sam and their premises we're trying<br>to thank Mike stead of the supply chain<br>and these will lower the cost and create<br>efficiencies in to support their<br>business trip strategy that I talked<br>about and it's one of the reasons we can<br>do it in technical direction we're<br>taking that we do we do bring scale you<br>know to our network and we move about<br>six and a half million tons and when you<br>look at the Fonterra and neat word which<br>is which is our largest customer you<br>know there's been nearly four scenes of<br>New Zealand's export tinu there goes<br>around goes through our system you know<br>metrics we know removed products on the<br>road and on the rail with a largest<br>means losing the road but we're about<br>the largest user of rail in mobility we<br>run about 2600 services a day we run<br>about trucks with it on an average day<br>between six hundred to a thousand trucks<br>on the road under air control we are in<br>about 100 trucks ourselves so they<br>support the offer business to actually<br>cool day other people's trash<br>we run those across about a thousand<br>they range between about a hundred or so<br>different different sites customer sites<br>we have six of our own hub locations<br>that we're developing and we're good<br>other warehouses around the trailer so<br>it's a pretty large network it doesn't<br>compare say a Maine freighter a<br>toll-free Berlin Fox or Peter Baker<br>there are a lot more complex we're we're<br>we thought we're rail to have so simply<br>an introspective logistics isn't here<br>any companies and then when you look at<br>the type of freight we move is quite<br>simple as obvious container alleges<br>pelletized butter food playing as duty<br>great so once again it's an element so<br>it's sort of think about I know I'm<br>going to academic institution the next<br>two slides will try to get a little bit<br>make sure they're all I know that's the<br>memory big booster for the divers tell<br>me that the last one of the people John<br>Key so I do appreciate and some Protista<br>stamina so hopefully I won't be as<br>exciting as they the basic premise that<br>we run run working independently<br>everyone can deliver and everyone<br>probably does it pretty well but while<br>actually working together and thinking<br>differently we can all make a step<br>change and around value efficiency and<br>sustainability and a major that can be<br>interesting but I guess what I'm going<br>to talk through today is you know some<br>examples some examples and just<br>signaling that me I am an engineer you<br>know I do like models and given I'm an<br>engineer I'm against not paying for the<br>academia in the room someone might have<br>thought of this before but like Goodwood<br>and nothing came up<br>so machining it doesn't exist in your us<br>I'm sure they are later whether this<br>makes me just something but once again<br>oh I we don't we don't work on these<br>models but to try and think coming into<br>this game awaits you what does what does<br>a model that we sort of all of the<br>suspect sentence and yeah you start the<br>left hand side and it all has to start<br>with a problem and generally it's going<br>to be a problem that's bigger than any<br>one person alone or more often than not<br>via customer driven problem that there<br>multiple people are trying to solve and<br>at that point you you have got multiple<br>people trying to solve these problems<br>and a lot of them will have a lying<br>strategies as to what the final achieve<br>it's about finding those people there's<br>an element of cultural alignment that<br>you kind of need to have to be working<br>with these people and there's a<br>requirement to be able to see the<br>billion each year the bedroom and<br>actually leading to a little angel<br>bergman away which is to the two things<br>that really you need when it comes to<br>collaboration is because the ability to<br>see the value see the value and the<br>second one is what we call I don't know<br>Super Saver but no no Dickens book<br>because actually if you're going to<br>collaborate the Sun it's never going to<br>be easy no matter how much this model<br>tells you it's kind of work it mean<br>that's what as easy as you think so you<br>kind of need to you know you don't you<br>don't be working with the keys simple as<br>that<br>and the concept is you want to be able<br>to invite them to your bed family<br>barbecue in the sexy the barbecue under<br>control and you need to trust they<br>believe all those trusts that when<br>things go wrong you can work through the<br>other thing that this is is the big<br>circle around the outside is has two<br>things in that one is he sort of meets<br>in scale do really going to make a<br>change in collaborative agrees to solve<br>some of the big customer problems you<br>need scale and you need a motivated<br>orchestra guitar Orchestrator does in<br>Australia you kinda need someone to take<br>the lead if you think that you're going<br>to come by our Empire<br>yeah generally what you need someone<br>that probably the person with the style<br>you can then play they play their lead<br>correctly you know you can make a<br>skipjack introspect back to the I guess<br>I spend a couple of slides going there<br>revealing to what we do and sort of the<br>problem that we that we were facing in<br>us there's not just about coder or you<br>know does steam from Fonterra that it's<br>really a New Zealand problem and you<br>know start it starts with the customer<br>and particularly getting our products on<br>shelves in Asia and recognizing the ex<br>you know customers are getting more<br>demanding in terms of cost service<br>quality particularly food products and<br>I'll make decisions looking at looking<br>at the products based on the use by date<br>whether it's been used by or not they'll<br>choose the one that that is the newest<br>its best thing in Telugu so yeah you're<br>competing against large global players<br>it and get onto shelves quicker than we<br>can<br>so really the I guess the the the point<br>from there leads to the next we as a<br>country we need to be competing against<br>the rest of the world and not against<br>ourselves war against air not we need to<br>be competing is that Mister well we had<br>a we work together to make<br>a reality and then you look at the<br>challenges that were no beanie in the<br>room wants to be more more verse 2 than<br>me and we are lawmakers well we're so<br>reliable ocean freight<br>the old adage is that we are more<br>reliable meaning that they are on us you<br>know it's not efficient to come down to<br>New Zealand they want us just not bother<br>coming now these are a lot of reasons<br>why they may not happen but you lay on<br>top of that the big ship strategies that<br>I've talked about before suddenly we<br>need to change what we're doing if we're<br>going to accommodate the bigger ships<br>that are being today and yet we need to<br>prepare for them we need the port's to<br>be dredged bigger cranes eccentric<br>cetera that we sing for that is<br>investment required investment requires<br>business cases it requires someone to<br>pay and it requires cargo to make sure<br>that investment will pay off and then<br>eventually you know the other point is<br>that their particular ship here is<br>actually very efficient<br>I think they yes sure the size relative<br>been you know 26 seen more efficient<br>than been some smaller vessels but I<br>believe this fall<br>and once again you think about the<br>dynamics of New Zealand and their<br>effective team you know all days a<br>smaller ship would be able to bounce<br>around all the ports because products of<br>all these different ports and at a<br>certain time that it because you can't<br>get to all those other ports so that<br>ship comes in here tonight you go to one<br>or two ladies three quarts it's all wet<br>Franks but has to go on that show<br>there's not actually a particular port<br>yeah we've got a we've never challenged<br>to fill that particular ship and that<br>requires us to think completely<br>differently event we have our main site<br>supply chain whether you consolidate<br>right close to the big ship port so the<br>minute ship comes in if you could very<br>quickly and I guess you know once again<br>you know theory is that sound you know<br>these ships don't want to hang around so<br>suddenly you've got to be so simple<br>customer problem is turned into quite a<br>large logistics problem here in New<br>Zealand so once again it all comes back<br>to at least been thinking about network<br>and then hand you make there and of<br>course you look at our a New Zealand<br>landsliding river and we're you know the<br>story I just told us they have we need<br>to change it and that requires at least<br>minute building house and it requires<br>bitty supply of them you know<br>interchanges and other capability but we<br>do know about the New Zealand Network it<br>rail depending on when we look at is in<br>the order of 30 trucks<br>anywhere between so the 60 that maybe 90<br>wasn't utilized if I really we have got<br>lots of space in a network so I guess<br>the point is how do we look at our lands<br>like networking take waster their<br>landslide network versus create value<br>out of that<br>before we start looking engine suited to<br>at least 2 billion and I guess we need<br>to think differently because you know<br>it's not just the old way of scale which<br>is what I talked about before heading<br>makes you got a big step because the<br>only you know strong competition and you<br>expected the supply chain it's the other<br>day if we still have inefficiency so the<br>old way doesn't work from a security<br>perspective the standard error I beat my<br>suppliers up to to create a different<br>way of working or define create there we<br>go the supply chain doesn't work we need<br>to think differently and what's missing<br>yeah we've got the demand we've got the<br>services<br>people that do stuff we've got people<br>that don't stuff so what's different we<br>don't collaboration we're not talking<br>all of these things are working<br>independently - all problems<br>independently there are problems and<br>they're probably quite good but we start<br>to look at that big problem so I've just<br>sort of taken taking you through people<br>working independently kind of solvent<br>then you start to look at them you know<br>peih-gee's think differently you know<br>thinking different remains from a<br>commercial perspective as well and then<br>they do you think about you know you'll<br>be familiar with this is essentially<br>pretty simply a Fonterra supply chain or<br>really easy supply chain and the way of<br>thinking is to do eventually from the<br>start of the supply chain through to the<br>end of the supply chain you know you<br>would get yeah you're weird house can be<br>efficient and you run it really really<br>well yeah but like it has we've got<br>later lost as they secretly because<br>that's the way to make your house<br>efficient you then ring the trucking<br>company and tell them in this case<br>imagine there's a track you've already<br>worked out you're going to go to the<br>nearest port because surely yeah the<br>lowest transport fosters to get to the<br>nearest port and you bring the truck in<br>you teleport I'm learning to be there<br>because you've worked out most on your<br>really efficient we ask what time your<br>so we've got a supply chain 101<br>fantastic and you're attracting goes to<br>the nearest port because you've got the<br>lowest landslide transporting and you<br>know what there's only one diesel there<br>and you've given the<br>however that you've got this right maybe<br>there's two and that actually was the<br>exact scenario for product on the loan<br>with island of a Taffaro Ontario move<br>down to plumbing supply chain but then<br>you did the the relative cost of their<br>supply chain and would get the Knicks<br>the other point of tell on that book at<br>the time they were this is the one or<br>two services at implements deal was 13<br>and they were quicker services to get to<br>where you need to get to in China and so<br>you started think will actually make you<br>optimizes this against the wind<br>why why might dictate it to by what's<br>happening over here which is that<br>sequential and you started to think I<br>mean you okay we can use Riedel and you<br>started to think about the supply chain<br>differently now your ocean freight has<br>come down and even these services<br>obviously theoretical numbers your main<br>transport I believe on it you're moving<br>product further well probably a lower<br>unit cost to Kilometre Array all the<br>rest write about and you know your week<br>hasn't because to make your array of<br>sheets on there you might need to extend<br>now knows that you're really house will<br>change the weather we have words or even<br>modifying some components of a you can<br>see you at least to know a supply chain<br>but your prize is captured because you<br>are able to see the intervene supply<br>China start to think differently there<br>yeah<br>not just depending upon a close but yeah<br>so you're - better - like it's a<br>collaboration value model evolution you<br>know probably a theoretical one so<br>hopefully this makes sense yeah and what<br>I've just talked about you you've done a<br>probably quite a classic rationalize and<br>thinking terrine and and it sort of<br>works but it's not you thinking is a<br>very start of a collaboration journey in<br>terms of how you actually capture W in<br>that case I've just talked about you<br>know you blower the into ink cost you<br>make sure you've actually improved your<br>services to China on the space you've<br>got more citizens you've rationalized<br>your ports in a way you are taking the<br>freight to another port being more<br>services are you've got the beast mode<br>and you've got a pretty damn good supply<br>chain so you can argue too much the<br>theme and then oh we use the ketaki in<br>the kinda formation model at this stage<br>so Fonterra had done this particular<br>piece of work and actually just to steer<br>people on the terrorist he couldn't<br>understand why would you seem to<br>products used to see 150 km using 100<br>characters because they couldn't see the<br>name to repel each other whereas<br>Fonterra was everybody wanted to see the<br>ocean<br>steps up but in cities actually<br>series cross seasonal so the point King<br>would was collaborate with other cargo<br>areas now and I look at books not look<br>at TV furniture just containers so what<br>I'm what have you cleared right without<br>the Carolinas and we<br>now start to look and we can we could<br>demand and the first thing we do is we<br>can commercialize some space on those<br>vessels and make some money and that's<br>why cotati was created so Fonterra spun<br>off an organization pool containing and<br>and kotahi was able to go in and work<br>with other cargo owners and so we could<br>and Abbott tried to write in a way boy<br>if I sit and write me in cells in the<br>night replace other cargo owners were<br>paying a lower rate and you know Tiger<br>was complimentary<br>created an either stream and but also<br>increased leverage so that Fonterra<br>could then go to the carriers and once<br>again rather than beat them up for<br>better rates they go actually if we we<br>do this well enough can we sue their<br>demand and we start to jointly plan<br>about how your assets are operating we<br>are going to take a whole ship out of<br>rotation and so this one for sure you<br>don't lose bring down to New Zealand so<br>what's that worth and it's sort of<br>another layer of collaboration and a<br>wave and again it's still it's still a<br>bit how you will prices now come down<br>and come down and you complimented your<br>price that you're paying with this<br>amoeba die begin and and you're having<br>really positive discussions with with<br>the ocean that carries around here you<br>will helping them be more efficient and<br>running<br>was that look like in terms of the price<br>of a discount I was working closely with<br>partners to optimize their suits and<br>lower risk lower risk for the ocean<br>carriers then you go a step further and<br>you start to say well that away then we<br>fundamentally change the cost base of<br>the network now the bigger ships come in<br>here because it was going to change<br>anyone since the picture strategy and<br>what - what once again that story I told<br>start volunteering needed to do to make<br>sure they can accommodate big ship but<br>heavy hitter you change the cost base<br>and lower the cost to serve get a share<br>in that value and then taking the<br>Federation to another whole level again<br>because suddenly I mean really they<br>don't go back to their theoretical model<br>without you know barbecue succeed drop<br>think one inherently she reveal you be<br>kind of oh you might have a big stick<br>you need to create the mechanisms and<br>the epimers having that sky over being<br>that all the strata help so have you'd<br>say well ok ok mr. ocean finally you're<br>going to move to a big ship we know<br>that's going to create efficiencies -<br>you were taken of this rotation we have<br>we're smoothing the volume we are at<br>least in an airport - to make sure that<br>we can accommodate you sure you were<br>going to save a lot of money hidden we<br>get a little bit so then you start to<br>think about long term deals pending the<br>kagura but this when you get one zero<br>three two entire he join with the nurse<br>all 10-year deal athenian deal stay can<br>afford we'll give you our body you can<br>guard and be asked you can create you've<br>got a ten year a little certainty around<br>what you need to do and and and you<br>start to get spin them down and that's<br>when code was born because kind of with<br>actually a formation of the landside<br>entities the problem Fonterra which was<br>details of four companies and the<br>landside entities report of Telamon who<br>were the type of priority and box<br>company called metropox a minute okay so<br>if they brought the landside entities<br>together and put a management team over<br>them and and run them as a single<br>organization so once again it's taking<br>another whole step of what collaboration<br>means in terms of how you envision<br>arrangements so that the value can be<br>shared you get back to their wall you<br>know sharing the value and more unique<br>ways long-term ways you're working with<br>people who your budget and value your<br>all strategically aligned and in the<br>case of the land so I'm you know Coach I<br>became their Orchestrator with the scale<br>behind us at Fonterra to bring all those<br>partners together mate to make this<br>nuclear cooperate so that we can solve<br>ultimately the customer problems will we<br>have our own customer problem justice<br>costs giving them a benefit let's take<br>an industry-wide key really to too low<br>and even with costs reduce vices<br>and I'll give some endpoint<br>we just yeah make one you gotta watch<br>the head I stand with proving anything<br>styling to talk about well I think<br>anyway about district by the planning<br>and use seamlessly connect all the<br>problems any technique system thinking<br>how you basically bring more people into<br>your model in Haiti to do that<br>seamlessly five beyond what you can do<br>you sort of traditional neatness stop to<br>look at digital technology growing scale<br>look at obviously to create either<br>streams of secretly value opportunities<br>of like the teen xmax a place that we<br>even be split and there's a visit as an<br>example of that type of thing that I'll<br>just share later<br>so I guess that was my two teams in a<br>way to think through what we've actually<br>done in terms of Fonterra<br>consolidating towards creating<br>photography smoothing demand creating<br>you know picture capabilities for<br>Corning Koga I mean even at least 19 X<br>all examples of where we've had to work<br>across the industry collaborate think<br>about that commercial models that we<br>prefer places who so that people would<br>actually in questions of that plan it's<br>kind of a natural break before I go a<br>little bit about death what PowerPoint<br>example quick question Scott you<br>inviting people to your family barbecue<br>let me help set of this exercise<br>have you already two selected who you're<br>gonna be right and no they're not the<br>gates using your technology or have you<br>picked them because of their volumes and<br>they're likely synergies and they find<br>but even if you don't ya I didn't I<br>wonder if you did any research on this<br>beforehand because in the US they do a<br>couldn't find anything and we've gone on<br>a little bit facetious do go play it's a<br>big no I don't think players in the room<br>think that but I think with a<br>theoretical about this we kind of New<br>Zealand does have some unique challenges<br>we just look to solve for what<br>we had to live in the park as we had in<br>front of us we're ready to island the<br>ocean carriers it wasn't a few ports I<br>would maybe we couldn't look we possibly<br>could learn more by going through but<br>and I don't think this is rocket science<br>you know this is just moving trucks to<br>trainers to look this all started and<br>all you might have even been around on<br>the frontier but a lot of the stuff this<br>started by some smart people coming in<br>and advising so but what even in that<br>point you know the big strip strategy<br>was just something with it we knew was<br>getting so you can sort of see the<br>vectors of the standings were called<br>people's thinking so what's going to<br>make sure a lot of their creatures well<br>I don't I don't think we have yeah which<br>is why I'm still I'd be interested to<br>see what other people think from that's<br>why coming in talking to an organization<br>like that is interesting for me because<br>so the question if I could go back one<br>slide because I think the story until is<br>a great story and it starts at left and<br>able to get to investment your<br>commentary if I can ask you around the<br>New Zealand temperature control network<br>which i think is under investment<br>hundred mr. Burson in the scenes they<br>became because of the age of the assets<br>and the suitability for the modern<br>supplier checking the quadrant in New<br>Zealand so I think it's an industry<br>question you would be I see a problem<br>two three four blocks along the journey<br>and do we stop there - solver today<br>clever comment we really need to start<br>at the beginning to be able to trust to<br>make a big investment in coaching I<br>think you yeah the thing of it I mean<br>confessing that we've listening just<br>leave this artist but we run obviously<br>chilled containers because of containers<br>container but when you start to think<br>about the length slightly a little<br>particularly to show you the way they've<br>changed me work then would be difficult<br>to be frozen so there's an element of<br>it's quite hard and as soon as you of<br>got frozen and transport League or<br>children you need the right<br>infrastructure either maintenance<br>secrecy but it does become more tricky<br>then there's something about yeah even<br>even just the biggest issues we've got<br>to me came there's just been added upon<br>compliment you cargo from others and<br>then be able to consolidate it becomes<br>chickens on the same remember that's on<br>the same space as the matter what you<br>like is that Vice President value it is<br>cap now they're often things around the<br>food great Indian there are some things<br>around but I think if you can get over<br>how you can scale the lamb sighting<br>because once it's in a container doesn't<br>make it maybe you could start really<br>unlocking this the truck trying the bike<br>once it's in a container it becomes<br>easier infrastructure challenging the<br>that kept your model which is Thomas<br>question oh yeah your is model around<br>customer problem yeah I mean close<br>relation what's interesting about sorry<br>what's interesting about the chilled<br>again is finding that that orchestrators<br>quite happy because the record and<br>unlike and like the Indian market we<br>you've got a lot of small players and<br>there's space for one large player to<br>come in and start to track some of this<br>activity you look at the children work<br>and it is there are these players for<br>stuff it's a higher barrier to entry<br>those players are in here in figure is a<br>result you've got a number of larger<br>play so we probably will following<br>amongst themselves that he could be the<br>beast and you you and then ultimately<br>you need the customer<br>finding and finding us large customer<br>there came like geese take the lead and<br>you look at once again this is based on<br>theory look<br>that chilled market um is you know this<br>is supermarkets entier is not dominant<br>and the chilled for example Fonterra was<br>dominant in the ambient food grade so<br>Galen like is that these styles are not<br>the biggest at and tries to change they<br>even don't have that scale on the<br>children in which they've got all these<br>players that are about the same and so<br>but you know so and that's always the<br>challenge with him and the challenge on<br>a weekend it's okay which cargo and can<br>we go to and start to have this<br>discussion knowing that if we have that<br>discussion we can actually change the<br>market everyone you go and talk to you<br>sort of it you know that he never big<br>enough to change the back and you always<br>think to give all that your honor in the<br>one room but then that will go different<br>yeah there's that's that complexity<br>things would I think still comes back to<br>here in this case guitar he was able to<br>be there and containers via comes<br>meeting Phoenix kept discovering this<br>like we've been able to do that from a<br>landslide ambience tracking postictal<br>and even in Vegas doing a none of us<br>really have the scale like I say my<br>barbecue you don't mean you like them<br>you just need to stick them and you need<br>to know that they have got some great<br>great answer may I ask you to go back to<br>your wall because it's with publishing<br>that you actually want to go back with<br>this when I come to tell me that no no<br>just I would ask occasionally barcodes I<br>think yeah so once again if I may just<br>talk about the temperature control<br>challenge when using them in greed<br>severe to find the right answer it is<br>maybe the menu lights the fuel<br>different right I think part of the<br>issue<br>Zillah motors like the Ford dealers<br>always seen the opposition as before<br>deal is among seems like he's never sick<br>Toyota or Honda expect fall against<br>Bordeaux whereas arm instead of thinking<br>about the New Zealanders New Zealand we<br>even think about the executive same<br>products that each company does wizard<br>he can easily collaborate it together<br>and start thinking like this so does it<br>have to be limited to chilled food<br>does it have to be limited to chilled<br>food couldn't it be across industry<br>collaboration oh yeah and it from a<br>Childress Big W yeah I think so<br>oh I know so you just have to align that<br>chilled product they need can it be<br>across the speaker don't know I think I<br>think that when you're dealing with food<br>that might be just the cushion of design<br>of the vehicle that you losing or design<br>of the like 7-eleven 7-eleven tea can<br>you go back to this more away what<br>actually what's not on here and there's<br>the pinion from the problem is yeah<br>there is some of it somewhere in here<br>these partners will need to invest in<br>different ways what to join at least to<br>the news of his cat so suddenly sheer<br>reality arrestees you only really want<br>to do it if you know that you follow the<br>cargo is on board that are going to be<br>in commit so that you know you there are<br>you know often often truck is going to<br>create new types of because they is a<br>market for them but when you starting to<br>do the spoken type arrangements and<br>you'll see that the example I'm going to<br>take you through you starting to invest<br>and bespoke type SES to solve a problem<br>like this and the quite unique you kind<br>of want to know you about ten years out<br>of it so you see someone need to know<br>that first so you needed to really got<br>you know these people all lined up<br>before you work and how you're going to<br>solve the problem in a way because your<br>product you all know you're involved in<br>the problem you've gotta like strategies<br>than you you're all kind of bought into<br>it you think said about trying solvent<br>as opposed to like it's the old way<br>which is all feel they try a book like<br>this and I'll see you like eat you know<br>I mean all response the next honoree am<br>see if I win and I'm liking this to my<br>kid to you conflict and lucky to wonder<br>you caught my kid no contracts you know<br>say it's that challenge or at least<br>thinking based and particularly once<br>again this is a big problem this is this<br>is significant investment to change<br>integrity then other model I just talked<br>about is people operating the same<br>network but trying to get the you know<br>get a little bit of competitiveness<br>which goes back to that they're just<br>trying to compete and works but it's<br>still an efficiently it's got tons of<br>the large supply chain class and you see<br>how much we get nervous for<br>collaboration hiding this huge career we<br>are just touching the surface we're<br>quite weak very specific around food<br>writers great companies doing similar<br>the same time there's a huge show you<br>the example someone just took some some<br>different thinking of me and the other<br>thing about this is there is always some<br>losses as soon as you make soon as you<br>take waste out of the tracking network<br>and you hit product in two trucks and<br>empty leaves the other way and you put<br>on one truck there's one truck driver<br>that's dead even alive so there is a<br>natural selection that goes on and you<br>know a small parameter they come by<br>around the fire you know you've invited<br>some people in some people keeping us<br>down for wait<br>that there will be and often there's the<br>noise you hear after the pekus that<br>people would understand because if<br>that's something on wall waste that<br>reading so you know and it takes a while<br>for those assets to be removed from the<br>system eventually available that might<br>be doing and eventually going to the top<br>people aspects of who you choose you<br>know people have to they have to be the<br>quality players they need to be this is<br>something we use this is really just an<br>example of what we've done and from a I<br>can teach to a perspective this is the<br>North other maybe you've got em for<br>isn't you've got distributors this is<br>the port it's actually put a tear on you<br>but it could well be Auckland this is<br>the level North Island we've got and I<br>guess the dynamics of New Zealand as a<br>country is there you know a lot most of<br>our most of our importers of<br>distributors do most of the stuff is<br>continual a lot of a large exporters<br>and in the case of imports and domestic<br>product probably if you think about the<br>very genome supply chain stuff that's<br>made Northland first to Cocina that<br>gives consumers often 25 or 25<br>successful so this is and of course the<br>fundamental before about our staff at<br>the airport supply chain the airport<br>supply chains not to be Airport<br>containers come<br>they control all right through to the<br>end also here they deep deep and the<br>stock is farm<br>sure and we need to contain the guys<br>into a storage interestingly enough I<br>think I don't know how many don't seem<br>to do I think New Zealand's biggest<br>still we bring in more in few time as a<br>woman do good story so that's what it<br>did they say why they seem to obtain<br>this once again going into the<br>containers text we're going we've got a<br>little container as narrow container<br>some kinky container sitting on the<br>staff causes to start being you look at<br>the export supply chain and they we seen<br>beam the empty container down to the<br>manufacture of these fourth when we put<br>them up right to get to the port two<br>things about this what you're<br>interesting one is that that is<br>obviously empty still a container and<br>then there's only partially utilized<br>because once again the ship comes in and<br>it's all about the order triangle it's<br>more about like the weird s is being<br>very efficiently that's loading the<br>orders and it realizes where the train<br>comes in it's quite an efficient supply<br>chain and if she keep it all think it's<br>quite good because I getting paid the<br>whole yeah both way it's the fact that<br>nothing's up determining an mg42 is<br>quiet because anything we look at it<br>okay well there's all the spice then<br>you've got your or see you're actually<br>trying to seemingly the seen<br>underutilized<br>they seem you seem in time isn't this<br>sort of ear and they're electronic<br>because this rail here is not often not<br>fully used because you've only picked<br>enough to go into the order to go onto<br>the boat and you maximizing their track<br>then you built your yeah then you've got<br>your domestic supply chain we've got<br>your importance seen stuff to<br>distributors who seem twenty focusing of<br>it down to the lone wolf Island and<br>ordinarily their truck might go back in<br>normal ways but now we know the trucks<br>been about 40% key during before you've<br>seen the time so once again you look you<br>look at that supply chain underneath<br>each individual supply chain you<br>probably would quite hard to get it<br>quite efficiently if they can have a<br>look at a lot of doublet lines and say<br>you go and then you think you are Golay<br>the strategic issue that we have which<br>is to fill a big ship and to get product<br>closer to four could be able to fill up<br>there so what are we going to do here<br>we're going to rethink it listening<br>group and at that point it's all about<br>bringing the supply tanks together and<br>takeaway Stephanie Twitter and we start<br>this time we'll start with the export<br>shipping containers that are sitting<br>here down to the product we call this<br>take the export product to the<br>consolidation point and a couple of a<br>couple of useful things about this we've<br>filled their drain their particular<br>chime in whereas you have the dotted<br>lines going around here we had filled<br>their train because we're actually we're<br>a 40-foot container was on a 50-foot<br>wagon and the original model the<br>eighteenth Inc with nothing<br>literally here at container that was 40<br> idiot we've now got some of<br>these 25-foot curtain slider units so<br>event at the 30% capacity d'Elegance<br>minute<br>so 30% more product is now on that rail<br>network that's a huge win and we're<br>solid a to their freight close from the<br>fourth reading for that big show<br>now we've had to change the whole model<br>with them frontier because I know that<br>no longer the star picking just a pure<br>finish the order that they placed<br>appears with all the things that they do<br>it through and this is now a very great<br>facility because we're unpacking that<br>container if we're sitting there product<br>and across time there's a cost involved<br>and then at that point we put bring the<br>container across to this point here take<br>it take it into an export box and<br>getting rather straight to port what's<br>interesting about this rail line is<br>where we're filling that train as well<br>because we because it's shorter mostly<br>we can get multiple orders of a train<br>and by the way that's actually got more<br>publicity on that rail line the metro<br>line and so in the old model we will<br>look driven by the capacity of that one<br>so there was not only unutilized but you<br>couldn't put as much on even if it was<br>for my usual eyes so you've got that one<br>will utilize and your pumping more<br>product after now what is the bigger<br>ship so slow so you've solved that<br>initial strategic problem again about<br>getting closer to the big ship port and<br>then being able to move the freight but<br>what quicker that address and you're<br>taking waste out of it and that the cost<br>of the export supply chain but you're<br>doubling and you had to at least pretty<br>smart okay<br>it's a mobile unit and metaphorically in<br>facility as one doesn't exist it will do<br>great at riolu any paper that you<br>actually look at the airport supply<br>chain probably not much changed still<br>quite common and might even camera<br>Aucklanders element but it just still<br>goes to the nth order but Enki<br>containers can possibly come straight to<br>this facility where it can be seen to<br>cross to the export container or in what<br>product can come to this facility as<br>well so suddenly of an import product<br>what export product all within the same<br>facility so you utilize an episode of<br>you a little bit more in your breathing<br>you to none of them once again<br>complementary product and how you manage<br>their secret passionate seeker and the<br>next bit is where the gold dust is<br>because at that point you're taking the<br>domestic product remember these guys<br>were rousted so they don't they don't<br>don't have access to well it's not<br>something they're used to doing because<br>they infect rails all about export<br>containers predominantly but you need to<br>have they used two trucks and the other<br>thing around was impurity and the trucks<br>on a big thing it turns up rubber wheels<br>blue where it needs to loot it and you<br>know that when it leaves its kind of<br>gonna go as straight and you might stop<br>for a file on the way but it's gonna get<br>to where it needs to and probably pretty<br>quick time and if there's a block which<br>on the motorway what I'm not going to go<br>around it right over bridges out you<br>know<br>and historically it always was so we've<br>it to really work with rails convinced<br>the distributors that actually we think<br>we can Road your product to this<br>facility or we can take one of these<br>units to your site you can line it up<br>you bring it to us here we'll take water<br>to half that will put it on the train<br>we'll take it down to the hub down there<br>you have got both ways right I haven't<br>seen full-on road again across to the<br>distributor there's only one just down<br>the road<br>MIDI utilization the Braille Lisa trucks<br>on the road so what combo and someone's<br>going to manage it<br>people have to change you come back to<br>Ponte related fundamentally change how<br>they load into port bosses they used to<br>label it on<br>that's a container the other one is not<br>on in fact they're now taking that's<br>quicker so they need to modify their<br>whole operation to make that happen but<br>they got seen they were saving through<br>quicker loading of containers they are<br>savings because they get lower costs<br>because you actually putting more a<br>wagon still playing the same wagon right<br>from the kind of a stick that we can<br>find that because we're now selling this<br>place going stuff people that are in<br>there the the FMCG so they run that<br>Camaro Ryland - what they were on Road<br>teams we've managed to live with Kiro of<br>the maxwell reliability its revenues<br>DeVito's different than what it used to<br>be on the track but then that's reliable<br>so if you think about overall strategic<br>benefits strategy because they're closer<br>to the port in terms of that<br>consolidation point we're creating we're<br>singing stuff to them which goes back to<br>the really inside of that<br>the collaboration but we're creating<br>more efficiency because we're using more<br>than rival pizza we're increasing the<br>utilization of the return trip to<br>actually 100% we're Fulbright waste from<br>where I had a billion do students think<br>we actually for trying that particular<br>both ways and we've increase profit<br>basically about 30 percent which is what<br>I need you to turn the 54 training on<br>their compare and we lowered staff and<br>customers 3 energy remember begging<br>trucks off the road and safety or reduce<br>carbon emissions and planting some trees<br>that's a great story as the strategy BN<br>puts our economic benefits social and<br>environmental in Texas but it's been<br>have paid to create a C's crossed off<br>into mobile units these into mobile<br>units that were spoken you're going to<br>invest in these you need to have<br>long-term contracts because in fact they<br>fit through two tunnels between<br>Palmerston North for our our the other<br>units the other ends of mobile units and<br>the New Zealand Army we've done then<br>quickly but right now they don't and so<br>we've had we have to design these and<br>the light is you actually notice the<br>sloppy in we had to design them because<br>they've got normally an export container<br>doesn't have comments on it so it can be<br>a bit love that's what can you do time<br>but we're did to design the the -<br>opening light so that we could look at<br>the product coming out of Colorado and I<br>think maybe 85% of it in terms of<br>density can fit amazing with pellets<br>then once we had to work out how they<br>how much structural rigidity he had down<br>the volunteer in terms of the height of<br>the actual unit to get through tunnels<br>then we had a high door like a lot of<br>design within these they had to be food<br>rated extends a sealable all the other<br>into mobile units and the New Zealand<br>Network would able to be sealed and it<br>seems to make the food great<br>requirements security requirements<br>actually you needed done it's better<br>that you can kinda see Lee and they just<br>put it here so that together like<br>stability would be as I hit the speech<br>the design done it kind of Maxine's but<br>you're gonna think throughly all these<br>things through which is so the quality<br>compliance the dirac alliance and the<br>business system you know getting even<br>getting northern our place on seven<br>drive which is where our facility is<br>this is the order being placed on a huge<br>interior to change their way of thinking<br>the MCG even to change their business<br>so they had to see double in the scope a<br>for collaboration want maybe see some<br>elements they were they're filling their<br>trains are but we had to tune their<br>happy with it and yet hopefully they had<br>to make some big mighty ships come<br>together to each other kind of my teens<br>but it's a big organization was true<br>same obvious all he has we're losing<br>Emma's we're taking trucks off the right<br>ahead and keep them engaged but we still<br>need them as I mentioned the other the<br>exporters and there anything sneak G's<br>head to think that because they actually<br>normal the MCG products could govern us<br>so we had to go well actually you know<br>think about your product in terms of<br>base good mix and what's your base<br>product that you can pump up do every<br>single day<br>down yeah put it in here illness stuff<br>senior on a travel so you may need to<br>start thinking about what they don't<br>know many of them do anyway well just<br>making sure that and then when you think<br>about going back to my model around and<br>I'll give you an example of captive we<br>bring camp down on the set of drivers<br>and import box rather than that box down<br>to the asite we they work out where it's<br>going to go they leave it on our side<br>baby and bring us in the evening and<br>they tell us the boxes we demand we know<br>exactly what factors going to go into<br>that TCP you know we know what product<br>this going to go to the awareness<br>whether aluminum or wood products gonna<br>go straight and it will retain our<br>different container to be posted down to<br>closer so once again we take that away<br>from me because we've got that's a<br>central unit we're all leave<br>contains easily an importer oh right so<br>we start to do that by the multimodal a<br>different way of thinking about the<br>supply chain that Jesus had to really<br>being in mind and changed him I see two<br>a day so whatever they're working a<br>physical model but I want to go into the<br>so yeah when we moving to the very right<br>hand side collaboration because of the<br>other like a BEC to a Christian in this<br>works the other thing that we know we<br>said there about two years ago and we'll<br>all the strike it work and we're talking<br>about right now every day at about three<br>o'clock we're still on the finding<br>before a trial and every day we still<br>haven't frankly we couldn't find a truck<br>for as it were so that truck doesn't<br>take that frankly some structural<br>challenges or the trucks on a sliver<br>and everyone else was doing the same<br>thing every other company was the prank<br>whereas is a ton trucks in the town<br>front they're just not anything so the<br>the standard way of pinning can just was<br>on a fine and it didn't quite work so we<br>the old classic mention at the end of<br>it works yeah and this has been yeah<br>there's two things is smart logic that<br>can mean that you can connect and go<br>back to the collaboration Metro you can<br>connect lots of people lots of pregnant<br>with lots of tracks seamlessly now there<br>are obviously constraints on this thing<br>Souleymane may look and this is the open<br>market but you know from technology was<br>completely and you've got these sort of<br>interfaces that people actually quite<br>like using one of the biggest challenges<br>we've got as in most cargo owners don't<br>want this because they know which trucks<br>coming to be stuck for the what they<br>prism so they don't want their like blue<br>star takes you they don't want to vote<br>this is still a useful tool in the<br>States for example there's a great big<br>open mike our spot market for trucks New<br>Zealand Milton Dylan's very relationship<br>based so comes back to the collaboration<br>question you know most people actually<br>in New Zealand I can collaborate with<br>the people that they've already invited<br>in the barbecue you know which is which<br>is fine and making the analogy slightly<br>pulling over there but yeah they don't<br>spread their minds to go people actually<br>if there's actually doing some stuff who<br>can I work with there maybe I don't know<br>and you know tools like this and name of<br>that but there's still this compromise<br>in the states I think however just<br>because the sheer scale so New Zealand<br>creates challenges around the Federation<br>as soon as you've got mates working with<br>makes well you know what you're just<br>going to live with you mate you could<br>well be you know probably party to this<br>missing outside at least being scale and<br>we're working with Sony be we kind of<br>pick and choose a winner<br>so there's silico specs they're coming<br>but this was patient again this is still<br>a living here for us but it takes a<br>little bit of collaboration to a whole<br>new space and I think really this is<br>giving two more slides but you know we<br>this is actually a internal strategy on<br>Aging suppose you know we are about<br>keeping each other competitive global X<br>is about creating the dimensions of<br>efficiencies and thinking<br>collaboratively with plane owners to try<br>it's keeping is really competitive on<br>the global stage so that's what we hear<br>that's what we sit up headset with us<br>our strategy is to optimize the nipple<br>if it's about m2 mobile capabilities for<br>PL which includes the technologies and<br>and 3pl solutions that needs to be<br>quality and Trust at sea and nonetheless<br>you need to either plenty of people are<br>technically doing that not many people<br>are doing all of these in one go but<br>it's a bit below the line that really<br>differentiates us a little bit now we<br>hit the scale which is what I talk about<br>in a model that helps we've got the<br>partnerships once again through that<br>network that we've created and as a<br>result you know where I would have taken<br>even with you be innovative and create<br>the neat work that we need to create so<br>that's an approach where you're<br>harnessing the power of meaning you keep<br>us all lunch to be here so yes we've got<br>loads of all of me that we talk<br>when we've selected but yeah you neck<br>relaxed the power to the other they see<br>the buh bility this is a cultural thing<br>sexually the fit that I think really<br>makes the difference is that is what<br>loosely be called the mission which is<br>we do once again take that Orchestrator<br>role you know we want to be the lead<br>we're in the positions of their using<br>we're honest and working collectively<br>you've done so much things we do it and<br>why are we doing and we are about<br>reducing life's which in spite of being<br>efficient and using bitter because you<br>know you're not going to control you're<br>not going to be able to achieve what we<br>try to achieve if you are just using a<br>little scale they have a biggest thing<br>just won't cut it comes to my last ones<br>people just went hang around because<br>this view is not value or they might be<br>shortened don't even know so it's about<br>thinking differently being transparent<br>and actually sharing those benefits<br>which is one of the last one create<br>value if you can't do this you can't<br>blame people into the value receive the<br>bill is fictive Lee none of this and we<br>call it spider logistics together in<br>this comic that's but you know you know<br>so we look and it works it has<br>challenges which goes back to the smart<br>logistics to give this criteria but any<br>one of these start to the road in life<br>changes you know if I go back to my 1 3<br>7 or 1 3 7<br>actually we had a global economic<br>downturn and seemingly to five before it<br>even started this whole thing because<br>suddenly innovation freight carriers<br>were dropping their records trying to<br>stay away so suddenly yeah one three<br>seven hearing the value the building<br>wasn't there this year and people didn't<br>mean to do all this great stuff to get a<br>lot of translation press right so you<br>have to sort of rethink it so things are<br>always changing if you think your<br>product collaborative model and your<br>value proposition is really clear and<br>everyone's aligned on your strategies<br>strategies change that in composition<br>has changed people changing innovations<br>change equal United might change that<br>any excessive it's a constantly moving<br>a question on your 4pl network yeah how<br>why do you make that available we don't<br>you patents well you're looking for a<br>model like mistakes now we're pretty<br>limited really nothing that's one of<br>that challenges but you know we in fact<br>it's funny I'm gonna stick my spot you<br>know way yeah this can be a bit of a<br>rocky a peg as well because and we<br>funded almost very much it's very much<br>so we don't mean too much beyond that<br>why don't we give it a mess there's lots<br>of value out there that we think you<br>but it means you can team to be if<br>you're very clear on that very clear on<br>that<br>so you able the launchers premiering on<br>so you might have multiple these in that<br>question certainly my experience has<br>been that continually changing the<br>landscape the shipping lines come and go<br>change their ports strategies change<br>people gut changing some partnerships I<br>have established if there's a strain<br>that keep them together<br>you think it will be lined up then we<br>met a year two years you can see things<br>begin look you started off with the<br>10-year term if you end your time again<br>you go five years or the 20 years how do<br>you film that dynamic plays out Givens<br>at this some real investments we made<br>whatever was actually going to say as<br>you were talking tom there's ethics is<br>really important to him the T's and C's<br>and illegals behind it you know no<br>yeah you can you've got to do all that<br>as well<br>maybe another thing on the model which<br>is yeah but you're an artist right so<br>that's a good point so I guess all of<br>those things are vitally important you<br>leave investment whatever that might be<br>this is between your doing there is no<br>secret is you know what you've worked on<br>us fixing a problem solved by<br>competition yeah well I guess there's<br>blood spots and businesses with where<br>supply chain wasn't major focus so<br>putting it into an organization to do<br>that so um how is this gonna kick on<br>from a New Zealand perspective with a<br>strategy and what we're doing with you<br>know these big lumps of infrastructure<br>and I guess the public investment behind<br>some of these assets well you know<br>his name you know portable can you go<br>see the same thing maybe it same thing<br>exactly the same thing and and there's<br>two schools of thought one is that we're<br>actually duplicating essence and you're<br>gonna go move it a little so you look at<br>Boston Road this is a long story deliver<br>my 15 escort bit really like some<br>containers and there's another one right<br>next door so yeah it's a bit straight<br>the reverse John Mike's just got a very<br>similar sort of model in terms of mixes<br>in terms of what they're doing<br>which is what your works and but there's<br>the second school scene fiscals what is<br>actually why don't we all play together<br>and then it begins a bit hard as well<br>alignment school of thought of surely<br>the ports can be a little bit more a<br>teacher because what does might have<br>emotion all of us and we just have warm<br>and the board's game but we're all one<br>thing gonna take it is that I actually<br>think you take a long-term view and you<br>know we're only getting more and more<br>phrase and we are there significant that<br>there's always going to be too much for<br>running one collaborative effort anyway<br>so the challenge v-nand is short term<br>this long saying how do you do you live<br>to give an hour or do you wait until you<br>have to you know you go to Rolleston for<br>example they'll be do both by the middle<br>and the meet level will both be out<br>ground within sort of probably 10 years<br>so what point you gonna quickly right<br>now we're hugely so so I don't quite<br>it's a tricky one<br>you can only play the ball that's in<br>front<br>and any players in the timeframe that<br>you will prepare doing risk you'll begin<br>to take and you are going to be<br>competing for their customers for<br>example of ulster Neerja but at the same<br>time you need to be confident as we are<br>with their Fonterra Collymore I wish<br>someone and we happy with it so it's a<br>tricky one in terms of with a New<br>Zealand inspector and dealing discussion<br>whether we should all sit there and kind<br>of all straight cards on the table<br>everyone come into the same but I'm<br>going to do very clever just light and<br>sustainable way but it's kind of weird<br>for me we're is a school so we can't<br>apply the bull this is one of us be<br>playing to certain key customers that we<br>hear there's a visible realization coda<br>we're not sitting there trying to<br>capture the market employee everybody we<br>go third grade dairy<br>containerized pelletized complimentary<br>Devon Terra where it makes sense<br>so we'll target memory because actually<br>if we give them this model works and<br>they can lower the cost of human we can<br>lower the cost upon pure and we can<br>create a model and they should be enough<br>key compelling proposition so that the<br>other guys don't walk in some cases we<br>greatly good piece even on that you win<br>some you lose them but it becomes corner<br>the best out there goes victim<br>what do you do become quite particularly<br>older than why you do which plates going<br>opposite direction that's competitive<br>how much is it how much of st-pierre<br>they carry the business development<br>service solution focused as opposed to<br>justice it's very much and why that why<br>they fit if you can show them that<br>actually there's an alignment but they<br>might catch it might need to change a<br>bit they're not appear to come at the<br>table or they don't take that box maybe<br>you need paper users<br>show me your money see how interest<br>available but knowing that actually they<br>have to so it becomes a bit of a trying<br>to just keep just to get them all set up<br>and then things change and they're easy<br>link to me there's a little bit of a<br>mystery degree because of Nina died yeah<br>we've got a port we needs and actually<br>get volume across just the same as<br>though his design we've got a large<br>customer then they need to get deep<br>containers the things one a know they<br>can film inspect<br>so you know all the wall heads<br>laughs as I can see you know if you do<br>have any more questions for Scott we do<br>have about 10 15 minutes of drinks that<br>where you can discuss it and ask<br>questions<br>Scott thank you very much yeah so many<br>problems and it was the globalization<br>technology ever-changing face of things<br>interesting model and collaborations a<br>way to go son because were anywhere<br>right now<br>so thanks very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
