tips on preparing for and attending video interviews.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>you'd prepare for a video interview the<br>same way that you're prepared for a<br>face-to-face interview so you want to be<br>dressed professionally you want to make<br>sure that it looks like you've made an<br>effort before you start the interview<br>make sure that you've prepared in the<br>same way as well as far as researching<br>the company thinking about some examples<br>that you can share for behavioral<br>questions and being confident talking<br>about your skills and strengths that you<br>can bring to the role bearing in mind<br>these interviews are really short so the<br>more prepared you are ahead of time the<br>more you can fit into the short 20<br>minute or so gap for a video interview I<br>would say just prepare as a few were<br>doing a face to face interview so<br>research the role and the company<br>practice with your family and friends on<br>answering some questions and have some<br>examples from your previous experience<br>so if you're asked you know list us your<br>strengths if you say you're dedicated<br>give us a reason why you say you're<br>dedicated so I'm a dedicated person I<br>can show this through my commitment to<br>my sport team over the last three years<br>as part of you know that teamwork of<br>going to practice and turning up to<br>games so in terms of preparing for video<br>interviews and the main thing that I<br>would suggest is one of the simple<br>things is getting getting used to the<br>sound of your own voice and because with<br>video interviews you are talking to a<br>laptop and we appreciate that that can<br>be a little bit unnatural and so things<br>like talking to yourself in the shower<br>if you're in your room talk to yourself<br>you might sound a little bit crazy but<br>at least you're familiarize yourself<br>with how you sound and talk to yourself<br>in the mirror things like that it's<br>really important to check technology so<br>anything can go wrong with technology so<br>making sure you're familiar with your<br>webcam your microphone as well as your<br>surroundings so the lighting is really<br>important making sure that there's no<br>distractions surrounding you and that<br>you're really comfortable with the use<br>of your technology so when you get a<br>video interview from Deloitte you have<br>time to read through lots of<br>instructions for you to go through so<br>make sure you're clear on what you need<br>to do<br>there's normally five Christians zero<br>they're about to weather a sex question<br>it's kind of a free-for-all so you can<br>say what you need to so you have time to<br>see what those Christians are and<br>prepare a little bit but my key advice<br>is don't over if of here don't script<br>looked at some of the Christians for you<br>/ and gosh I would feel challenged by<br>some of these Christians that you're<br>being asked so don't a sphere the first<br>five Christians are they meet to<br>challenge you but the six Christian is<br>the one where you've got two minutes two<br>minutes to tell us all about yourself<br>and who you are and why you want to work<br>for Deloitte and there actually is the<br>first question I go to because it<br>actually shows me the true person that's<br>sitting and on the video in front of me<br>so I actually want to see that Christian<br>first that's your chance to shine and to<br>show us who you are you can show your<br>personality during a video interview by<br>looking at the camera avoid reading off<br>the screen you'd be surprised how many<br>students do that it's very obvious to<br>the person reviewing the video smile be<br>yourself there's no reason why you can't<br>introduce a little bit of humor<br>obviously you want to stay professional<br>but if you can introduce yourself at the<br>start a bit of a elevator pitch on you<br>and why you've want to join the company<br>it can be a little bit more difficult to<br>show your personality in a video<br>interview because you're not you don't<br>have that you know backwards and<br>forwards between<br>the interviewer and your south building<br>that rapport so my advice would be to<br>have personal examples because that way<br>you can say you can give your answer and<br>then show a little bit of yourself and<br>how you deal in certain situations and<br>that will come across in the video<br>interview space it's really important to<br>be as natural as you can and try not to<br>be scripted and try not to come across<br>as a little bit robotic and show in<br>reading off off anything in particular<br>it's really good to have visuals on<br>either side of the screen and what you<br>don't want to come across like you're<br>just reading off a piece of paper so<br>I think being in terms of trying to be<br>yourself and trying to show your<br>personality it's good to maybe add some<br>humor in their appropriate humor and<br>things like that just try and be as<br>natural as you can<br>so if there's any technical issues ahead<br>of a video interview reach out to your<br>recruiter and they'll help you solve<br>them don't try to start the interview if<br>you don't have a proper secured Wi-Fi<br>connection or if you're having laptop<br>issues it's better to postpone the video<br>than to complete it at a low standard so<br>it's important to be professional when<br>you're interviewing and during video<br>interviewing so it's similar to what you<br>would expect to see when you go into a<br>face-to-face interview the whole team<br>could see it possibly just depending on<br>who's part of the process generally it<br>will be someone from HR and maybe in a<br>hiring manager as well video<br>interviewing generally happens in the<br>initial stage of a recruitment process<br>and it is only the recruiter who will<br>review your video at Accenture 100% is<br>only the recruiters depending on that<br>particular stream that you've applied<br>for or that we're considering you for<br>you may have a different recruiter but<br>it doesn't go further than than the HR<br>recruitment team so it deloitte the<br>video the video interviews are normally<br>viewed by the recruitment advisor who's<br>looking after their if that's not the<br>great recruiter because we get so many<br>applications it'll be another member of<br>the team and then if you're successful<br>the video interview goes through to the<br>service lines so within each of our<br>service areas or business areas they've<br>got dedicated team members who do the<br>graduate recruitment each year and they<br>will look at your videos so it's not<br>everybody only select people can see<br>your video so in terms of who the video<br>interviews are viewed by at KPMG we the<br>recruitment team do have access to view<br>them but it's that point in our process<br>where they do get passed on to partners<br>and senior managers and so they are the<br>ones that actually review the video<br>interviews which can sound a little bit<br>daunting but it's a really good chance<br>for you to kind of add an extension to<br>your CV so it's putting a face to the<br>name and and just yeah showing showing<br>other things that a student needs to<br>know in terms of video interviewing and<br>one of the important things that I do<br>always say is to just be conscious of<br>the pace and so we at KPMG give you two<br>minutes to review the question and then<br>two minutes to answer the question as<br>well and so just thinking about how you<br>can answer the question it's really<br>important to us that you don't go off on<br>a tangent and that you bring your answer<br>back to what we're actually asking you<br>and we you know we understand that you<br>want to get as much information tools as<br>you can within that two minutes and what<br>we want it to be relevant and we want it<br>to be punchy so just thinking about your<br>pace and your stride and when you're<br>answering those types of questions one<br>of my tips for video interviews is don't<br>script your answers have some idea about<br>what you want to say but don't scrap<br>them and don't have them all written<br>down and put off to the side of the<br>video we can tell when your eyes are<br>traveling over and you're reading from<br>your script and it doesn't really<br>impress to be honest so you know have<br>some idea have a little bit of a<br>practice but don't read off a script as<br>one of my pieces of advice in terms of<br>video interviews pay attention to when<br>the video interview is due back you'll<br>get a finite window to get it completed<br>however we did have some examples this<br>year of people who were overseas on<br>internships and things and who were<br>unable to get to the video within the<br>time frame we'd specified so we were<br>able to give them extension on that so<br>reach out to the team and let them know<br>that you can't do it for whatever reason<br>we're pretty understanding but on the<br>flip side of that we recruit as we go so<br>the longer it takes you get your video<br>interview back the chances are that you<br>know you might not get an interview if<br>you take too long to get it back so but<br>if there's a problem then absolutely<br>reach out and talk to us wherever you do<br>your video it's well-lit it's quiet test<br>your equipment make sure your video<br>works your microphone works we've had<br>some very interesting videos cats<br>jumping through windows all sorts of<br>stuff and the students and Christian has<br>done very well to keep going but yeah<br>try to make sure that you know your<br>flatmates are going to boost and on you<br>asked you're doing it or you're not<br>doing it at four o'clock in the morning<br>and you know we can see you and he you<br>is really key<br>this is your one chance you've got six<br>questions for us to go yes this person<br>should come in and meet with us so make<br>it count so the most important things to<br>remember with a video interview is to<br>dress professionally do your research<br>smile be yourself and don't read off the<br>computer screen<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
