Geoffrey Palmer QC on Wednesday 26 September at the University of Auckland general library.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>ladies and gentlemen this lecture<br>commemorates the life of one of our most<br>distinguished judges and citizens so own<br>Woodhouse's compassion generosity of<br>spirit and social conscience were<br>reflected in his work as president of<br>the Court of Appeal president of the Law<br>Commission and chairman of the Royal<br>Commission that recommended a no fault<br>accident compensation scheme he made an<br>immense contribution to New Zealand law<br>and society the sir Owen Woodhouse<br>Memorial Lecture was established last<br>year with the intention the lecturers<br>will reflect sir Owens interests in the<br>law social justice and social reform the<br>lectures hosted jointly by the Auckland<br>of Victoria law schools and given in<br>Auckland and Wellington each year last<br>year's inaugural lecture was given by<br>Sir Kenneth Keith on the topic of<br>promoting safety through law national<br>and international and by other means<br>this year's lecture has been given by<br>Sir Geoffrey Palmer and we'll examine<br>the woodhouse report of 1967 the<br>framework had established for New<br>Zealand's groundbreaking approach to<br>no-fault accident compensation and how<br>this has been implemented during the<br>last half century<br>there could be no one better qualified<br>to discuss the woodhouse report and the<br>impact it has had so Geoffrey worked<br>alongside and was a close friend of Sir<br>Owen Woodhouse I understand that they<br>first met when Sir Owen and the other<br>members of the Royal Commission came to<br>the University of Chicago to talk to<br>some of the professor's there so<br>Geoffrey had dinner with them and<br>afterwards drove Sir Owen back to his<br>hotel in his I gather uninsured<br>Chevrolet two years later Sir Geoffrey<br>wrote the white paper tuning the<br>Woodhouse report into government policy<br>he was later appointed as Sir Owens<br>principal assistant to the inquiry set<br>up by the Australian Prime Minister to<br>consider introducing a similar scheme<br>there so Geoffrey's book compensation<br>for incapacity was the first full<br>academic review of New Zealand's<br>excellent compensation<br>scheme and he is written extensively on<br>it since together with sir Owen sir<br>Jeffrey has been at the heart of<br>pioneering the social vision of a no<br>fault accident compensation scheme he<br>has as you'll of course be well aware<br>also made many other contributions to<br>public life and to New Zealand as Prime<br>Minister as Attorney General Minister of<br>Justice Minister of the Environment and<br>president of the Law Commission from the<br>bull of rights to MMP to the empowerment<br>of the Waitangi tribunal to his current<br>campaign for a written constitution Sir<br>Geoffrey has worked to improve New<br>Zealand's Constitution its government<br>and our society has influence on New<br>Zealand is profound and enduring would<br>you please join me in welcoming Sir<br>Geoffrey Palmer nie we okay moto<br>tena koe tena koe tow tena koe tokoto<br>Deane knows that introduction was<br>extremely generous and fulsome and I'm<br>not sure it was properly dessert but<br>thank you all the same<br>now this lecture is quite long it's not<br>just a nine second sound bite and it's<br>quite complicated because of the years<br>that it covers and so what I'm doing now<br>is putting up the structure of this<br>lecture so you can follow it as I go<br>because I've written 25 pages of fairly<br>dense prose and without very many jokes<br>in it and I will speak to the paper I<br>won't read it because that will send you<br>all to sleep you may go to sleep anyway<br>but I will endeavour to avoid that now<br>the thing that I want to say first is<br>that Sirhan was a dear friend of mine<br>and this lecture celebrates the<br>importance of his contribution to New<br>Zealand including his most significant<br>his recommended design of our accident<br>compensation system and no lecture about<br>him and his contribution can avoid<br>dealing with Owen Woodhouse the man he<br>was a complex multifaceted human being<br>blessed with a penetrating intellect and<br>empathy those two things are not always<br>found together his compassion for people<br>was perhaps his most salient<br>characteristic the number and range of<br>his friends was astonishing both in New<br>Zealand and overseas and he had the gift<br>of friendship he inspired loyalty and<br>affection with the teams of people with<br>whom he worked he encountered many tough<br>situations especially in the Second<br>World War where he was the commander of<br>a motor torpedo boat in the<br>Mediterranean and an intelligence<br>officer as well and he visited as has<br>already been said the Chicago Law School<br>where I was lucky enough to meet him and<br>that caused an enduring relationship<br>that changed my life now<br>Odin was a warm-hearted visionary<br>blessed with wisdom he believed that<br>those in distress should be helped and<br>the well-being of each one was of<br>concern to all he looked into the future<br>to see how it would be and those<br>qualities were reflected not only in his<br>judicial decisions and his work as<br>president of the Law Commission but also<br>in reports on accident law and in all of<br>this he carried his message through a<br>unique prose style always spare his<br>prose had a limpid and crystalline<br>quality it was the result of painstaking<br>revision and redrafting the Woodhouse<br>report in Australia went through now<br>drafts and these reports were powerful<br>elegant and persuasive and as Sakina<br>teeth said in the inaugural Woodhouse<br>lecture last year they were full of<br>clear thinking and clear writing those<br>were owen Woodhouse's hallmarks now we<br>begin this story with the common law<br>origins of accident compensation the<br>common law came to New Zealand with the<br>first white settlers and it developed<br>over time so that people who suffered<br>personal injury by accident could<br>recover damages assault and battery of<br>course were always actionable in the<br>courts but the great tort of negligence<br>took much longer to develop it developed<br>over the latter half of the 19th century<br>and expanded in the 20th and this opened<br>up possibilities of significant Awards<br>of damages after a jury trial<br>it was the pot of gold at the end of the<br>common-law rainbow that people sought<br>and in order to do that you had to<br>demonstrate negligence on the part of<br>the defendant and that meant that many<br>people couldn't possibly succeed there<br>were three main defenses available<br>contributory negligence which for a long<br>time was a complete defense and then it<br>was reduced by the percentage of<br>contribution then there was the common<br>employment rule which said that you<br>couldn't recover from the employer if<br>you were injured by another employee and<br>third that the plaintiff had voluntary<br>assumed the risk those defenses of<br>course were modified or abolished by<br>statute over time but the plight of the<br>young compensated victim created a<br>social burden that was too heavy to bear<br>with the result that both England and<br>New Zealand at about the same time<br>adopted workers compensation which gave<br>you more<br>earnings related payments and hospital<br>medical expenses in the event that you<br>could not succeed at common law but you<br>could pursue that remedy at the same<br>time as common law and it also in those<br>days workers compensation gave coverage<br>for industrial disease and some ways<br>more generous than the existing Act does<br>for industrial disease now what happened<br>with this system was that it was a<br>liability system in which you had to<br>prove negligence but if you didn't have<br>any money that is to say the impecunious<br>defendant was a real problem to the<br>social objective so compulsory insurance<br>was introduced in order to if you got a<br>judgment you could get some money 1928<br>New Zealand put compulsory insurance on<br>motor accidents for motor cars because<br>motor cars were a potent source of<br>accidents and the compulsory liability<br>insurance existed for employers as well<br>now while all this was going on in a<br>happy little legal system dominated by<br>the common law the welfare state had<br>been developing gradually notably with<br>the old-age pensions Act in 1819 1898<br>and then came the Social Security Act in<br>1938 that provide comprehensive flat<br>rate payments for people with disability<br>of various kinds and also that<br>established a public health system of<br>legislation so these systems continued<br>together for a long period of time until<br>leave without any great expression of<br>public opposition to them until a Royal<br>Commission was established by the<br>government in 1967 that had been<br>preceded by a committee on absolute<br>liability that couldn't really agree<br>about the principle the Royal Commission<br>however was set up very carefully to<br>ensure that it reached a result now that<br>was the background to the common law<br>action<br>enter the Woodhouse report three royal<br>commissioners one was the former<br>secretary another one a prominent public<br>accountant and Sauron himself then a<br>judge of the Supreme Court what he<br>produced was a revolutionary report and<br>it out quite a lot to Sir William<br>Beveridge is 1942 report in the United<br>Kingdom now the first point that I of<br>substance that I want to make is this<br>began life as a legal law reform but it<br>had messianic tendencies it wanted to<br>take over the entire welfare system and<br>in some ways that is the most important<br>outcome of this lecture that I want to<br>convince you that there is unfinished<br>business here as a result of the wood<br>house report and it needs to be<br>addressed now the wood ass report was<br>written and optimistic language even<br>inspirational it really was based on<br>five simple principles and those<br>principles were community responsibility<br>comprehensive entitlement complete<br>rehabilitation real compensation and<br>administrative efficiency now the report<br>itself was notable for the sustained<br>attack that it conducted on the common<br>law system it said that a waste was a<br>feature of the system very big<br>administrative and legal expenses so<br>that much of the money that was exact it<br>was never reached the injured person at<br>all they're also very long delays in<br>this and personal blameworthiness wasn't<br>really the rationale for the law because<br>negligence required individuals to meet<br>a community average standard so as the<br>wood house report put it reprehensible<br>conduct can be followed by feather blows<br>while on moments inadvertence could call<br>down the heaven<br>liability insurance of course had<br>blunted or removed the deterrent effect<br>of tort law an assessment of lump-sum<br>damages at once in one time had a lot of<br>guesswork involved and speculation it<br>might it tended to overcompensate<br>smaller lesser injuries and under<br>compensate really big ones that went on<br>for a lifetimes people who were<br>quadriplegic for example and the process<br>of adjudication was a lottery I'm old<br>enough to have appeared in in jury<br>trials involving put it was so exciting<br>so dramatic so wonderful lawyers for<br>love that sort of thing but it was<br>pretty socially futile it was a gambling<br>game what would happen is if you were in<br>a personal injury practice you would<br>settle the large number of the claims<br>and you'd try one or two of them and<br>that was how the system worked accident<br>prevention was impeded by the system<br>quite dramatically and so what the<br>woodhouse report had to do was to<br>convince the decision makers that the<br>action had to be got rid of we're the<br>only common law jurisdiction I think<br>that has thoroughly done that so far and<br>one might wonder is people did it my<br>last week's lecture why that was so I<br>have very clear understanding about that<br>it was because the best interests were<br>able to prevail elsewhere the lawyers<br>were quite pernicious about it in<br>Australia Sir John Kerr didn't help<br>either but there was there was in<br>England a Royal Commission of 14 who<br>came out here and boy they produced a<br>report of the most hopeless character<br>now what the Woodhouse report said was<br>that all tort laws to be swept away<br>everyone who was injured by accident<br>whether it was at work on Road playing<br>rugby or anywhere else would be<br>compensated no new money would be needed<br>because it would all be paid for from<br>the funds that were compulsorily<br>exacting to pay for the tort system and<br>workers compensation now<br>that was magical in political terms and<br>of course the waste was emphasized 40%<br>of the money did not go to the injured<br>people and so this was took a bit of<br>took a bit of digesting by the<br>government of the day it looked very<br>attractive and this is hitting 3 the<br>scheme looked very attractive when it<br>came out and people used to read these<br>things in those days and newspapers used<br>to report them to these days of course<br>have gone but adopting this report took<br>quite a long time because it was going<br>to deprive insurance companies of a<br>significant portion of their business<br>and transfer those funds to the state<br>and that made a few and the ruling<br>national government a bit nervous which<br>is why they got the white paper<br>commissioned and the white paper really<br>was a vote of confidence in it and the<br>reason that I got to write it was that I<br>had no no and so you see Owen was a real<br>operator he knew how to get things done<br>now only half of the Woodhouse<br>recommendations were actually<br>implemented key provisions were rejected<br>this makes it quite difficult to judge<br>how the Woodhouse reform model would<br>have worked had it been enacted the what<br>else model has not been tried yet and<br>that is a really important point to<br>appreciate why unfinished business still<br>exists the major policy issues on which<br>it did not prevail included the<br>administrative arrangements quite a lot<br>about eligibility the causes of and the<br>degrees of incapacity had the report<br>been adopted as it was written it would<br>have been much easier to integrate the<br>scheme into the wider system of income<br>support that New Zealand has and still<br>has and and just remember this this is<br>my favourite paragraph of the whole<br>report these days 3:09 be informal and<br>simple<br>should be the key to all proceedings<br>within the jurisdiction of the board<br>applications should not be made to<br>depend on any formal type of claim<br>adversary techniques should not be used<br>and adrift illegal ISM should be avoided<br>well that never happened but at least it<br>did happen to begin with but it doesn't<br>happen now it hasn't been achieved that<br>I there have been constant difficulties<br>about all that but one thing over the 45<br>years since enactment has remained<br>constant<br>there has been no political appetite to<br>return to the common law action for<br>damages the accident compensation<br>corporation as it now is has developed<br>into a large and significant public<br>organization big footprint and New<br>Zealand life look at the 2017 annual<br>report three and a half thousand staff<br>1.95 million new claims 85% of the total<br>expenditure of the money went to<br>claimants or for services on them it has<br>an investment portfolio of thirty seven<br>point three billion dollars and it<br>reported and proved satisfaction levels<br>from claimants not that those levels are<br>very high yet and the there is a whole<br>lot of statistics about how quickly they<br>were paying people and how quickly they<br>resolved things I won't go through them<br>and only a week or two ago it announced<br>the corporation did that it was doubling<br>its investment a huge business<br>transformation program to 669 million<br>for casting that would make staff ten<br>percent more productive now this brings<br>me to the topic of finance delivery and<br>administration financing the scheme is a<br>critical issue in it and it revolves<br>around the relative merits of<br>pay-as-you-go compared with a fully<br>funded private insurance scheme and they<br>have been enormous gyration<br>over time about how the scheme should be<br>financed and big disputes about it and<br>scandals about it and ministerial<br>resignations about it<br>now the this was designed as a<br>government scheme of social insurance it<br>must have the final backing of the state<br>oh and C is for this reason that a<br>formal system of funding cannot be<br>regarded as essential to the stability<br>of the scheme and that is a quote from<br>the rude house report so you see<br>employers objected to the levies there<br>were often political disputes about this<br>I'm trying to summarize many years of<br>history here but I just want to say to<br>you that one thing that this constant<br>has been disputes about the levees what<br>else remain had recommended flat rate<br>levies the employers got graduated<br>libby's and all the economists in the<br>world have tried to say that in fact you<br>need to internalize the costs of<br>accident so they reflected in the<br>product and all the best economic<br>research has been done on this as failed<br>to make the case you just can't show<br>that that works and the social insurance<br>model of course was not followed and<br>there was of course the short-lived<br>experiment to allow private insurance<br>companies to write insurance with this<br>earnest scheme that was passed in 1998<br>and repealed by the New Labour<br>government in 1999 and and when of<br>course the scheme was changed in 1998 to<br>provide fulfill full funding that was a<br>prelude to the introduction of<br>competition from insurance companies and<br>we still have the system now where it is<br>fully funded now you don't fully fund<br>the education system or the medical<br>system you know that those charges are<br>going to come to the government but why<br>is this<br>different I don't think that's an easy<br>question to answer<br>social insurance is quite different from<br>private insurance the would our scheme<br>was one with social goals and social<br>purposes for a compassionate and just<br>society and some of the attacks on the<br>scheme by some of the economists have<br>been full of assertion about<br>inefficiency moral hazard policy failure<br>objections that seem to be based I think<br>more on neoliberal ideology that on<br>sound economics likewise a proper<br>understanding of the purpose of New<br>Zealand schemes suggests that<br>privatization is no more appropriate for<br>accident compensation than it is for the<br>Social Security Act about which I have a<br>lot to say in a few minutes now of<br>course there been many statutory<br>reconstructions and changes over the<br>scheme far too many to go through here<br>the initial idea was it would be set up<br>under a board of three and that the<br>model for that was the Ontario workmen's<br>compensation board that oh and it had a<br>look at but he wanted to be under the<br>general responsibilities of the Minister<br>of Social Security now the Minister<br>Ministry of Social Development and to be<br>attached to that Department for<br>administrative purposes that was not<br>followed that was a critical failure<br>that is the reason why the these two<br>programs continued together as the old<br>ones did so the next big change that<br>caused TT was 1982 I was in the Houston<br>and tried to change a lot of this and<br>got had quite a measure of success for<br>an opposition doing that but that set up<br>a board a board to look at it more<br>businesslike it was said by Derek<br>Quigley he was the minister but the<br>point about that was that it was<br>stakeholder representation really and so<br>I don't think that it has been at all<br>successful in generating policy the<br>actual policy<br>development came of course at the<br>beginning from the old Department of<br>Labor that was incorporated into the<br>ministry of innovation employment and<br>whatever else it is it's a lot of things<br>and it's a big department and ungainly<br>but it's got some competence except it<br>hasn't got much in this area and I don't<br>think that ministry has been an<br>effective policy advisor on this scheme<br>and I don't think it's the right<br>ministry to be giving the advice and the<br>policy generation capacity of ACC itself<br>has turned out to be pretty uh haphazard<br>and unsatisfactory of course the<br>treasurer is always taken a pretty<br>strong interest in this scheme because<br>there's a lot of public funds involved<br>in it and very uneasy tensions inhabit<br>the shared interests of the scheme<br>various parts of the government they're<br>not easily resolved so I don't think<br>that the administrative problems that<br>have been difficult for the schemes were<br>out they've never been addressed in a<br>very satisfactory fashion from a policy<br>point of view there's been a lot of<br>public dissatisfaction at various times<br>this accident compensation corporation<br>is an outlier in the government system<br>is that a lot of controversies in recent<br>times has been an independent inquiry<br>over claims handling done by Maryam Dean<br>QC they've been efforts made to turn the<br>scheme into something that it's not and<br>was never intended to be having a board<br>hasn't added value in my view I think a<br>Department of State would have bathed in<br>a way that would have been superior to<br>that of the corporation I think it would<br>be better to hand the matter over to a<br>Department of State operating on the<br>conventional principles of ministerial<br>responsibility a classical system for<br>the Westminster system that we seem to<br>be forgetting about here now what are<br>the failures perhaps two of them lie in<br>accident prevention and rehabilitation<br>the woodhouse report was emphatic that<br>these<br>were priorities they haven't been the<br>money answer always dominates in this<br>sort of thing especially in the<br>political decision-making system how<br>much money am I going to get<br>if in doubt follow the money the royal<br>commissions tried to have an integrated<br>scheme but of course it didn't own the<br>accident compensation system has never<br>owned the regulatory department that<br>dealt deals with safety and if you<br>remember the terrible problems we had<br>with safety at work and the problems<br>that we that we got into over the coal<br>mine Fiasco and the fact that we got rid<br>of the light-handed regulatory model and<br>introduced one that was much stronger<br>and it was necessary to do that but you<br>see you can't do that through anything<br>like the through the ACCC they don't own<br>the regulatory machinery so they're<br>never going to be leaders in that and<br>although they've published good<br>statistics in recent years there hasn't<br>been enough analysis of the statistics<br>to get the insights into accident<br>prevention that you really need now on<br>rehabilitation they haven't been as<br>successful as they should have been<br>either although there's been a lot of<br>money gone on to rehabilitate accident<br>victims that they didn't get before as<br>Don Reaney who used to be an advisor to<br>the original corporation and is now the<br>chair of the Law Society Committee on<br>this he writes about this and he said<br>that ACC should be a world leader in the<br>rehabilitation of injured people but<br>really it's aim has been to get climates<br>off the system which is a different<br>thing and indeed I think there is<br>validity in that point now the changing<br>I think the administration of the<br>accident compensation system needs to be<br>considered it can be strongly argued<br>that if accident compensation was<br>administered through a Department of<br>State that the policy-making would be<br>better considered and better aligned<br>with other income support programs<br>which are designed to alleviate poverty<br>now the story gets even worse it's a<br>return to legalism over the years<br>legislation on accident compensations<br>become longer and more complex it's less<br>generous than when it began it's more<br>restrictive and the the problem has been<br>this and it's well set out in the<br>decision that the Chief Justice in a<br>case in the Supreme Court said the<br>injury prevention rehabilitation and<br>compensation Act 2001 I'm quoting<br>provides cover on the basis of<br>line-drawing which reflects policy<br>choices such line-drawing has resulted<br>in legislation which is technical<br>approaches taken to the interpretation<br>of provisions under earlier accident<br>compensation need to legislation need to<br>be treated with some caution and<br>considering the current legislation<br>you've got a problem if you you've got<br>to decide which act you're under that<br>legally is not terribly straightforward<br>for a star nor she says is the<br>legislation easy to follow it contains<br>much cross referencing repetition and<br>circularity in expression and indeed the<br>2010 amendments that came after though<br>those made things even worse now then<br>you have the business of Apple people<br>who apply for a benefit they get a<br>review in front of an independent<br>reviewer who conducts a hearing that's<br>organized by a company contracted to the<br>own ACCC and I'm told by the people who<br>do the review it<br>that seems as extremely strange<br>arrangement for a state scheme of this<br>sort but then you can appeal to the<br>district court remember Owen said you<br>weren't supposed to have legalism unless<br>we've got legalism squared in it now<br>and there can be an appeal on the point<br>of Lord of the high court but just take<br>this point neither the accident<br>Compensation Scheme nor the Social<br>Security legislation allows you to get<br>the Supreme Court of New Zealand to<br>adjudicate on what the appropriate<br>interpretation of the statute is which<br>is what the function of a final pellet<br>Court is he have got two massive schemes<br>which are designed to help people lots<br>of them and you cannot get a proper<br>adjudication on the interpretation of<br>the statute and and that really is quite<br>wrong from a rule of law point of view<br>now if you look at the way in which this<br>has gone the search of the Ministry of<br>Justices judicial decisions online<br>record show there were three 437<br>accident compensation cases in the High<br>Court and Court of Appeal between 2003<br>and February 2018 there have probably<br>been thousands in the district court<br>this was a scheme to do away with the<br>need for lawyers when claiming<br>compensation for personal injury now the<br>legislation is so intricate that lawyers<br>are often needed constant legislative<br>fiddling with the scheme is produced in<br>justices eligibility depends on which of<br>the statutes of the injured person may<br>be subject to and ICC has become highly<br>legalistic this creates unfairness the<br>way in which medical evidence is used to<br>deny claims has attracted much vocal<br>opposition from in the community an<br>extensive study done by the University<br>of Otago led by Warren Forrester and he<br>is doing he's got a Law Foundation grant<br>to do more work on this as he's<br>currently doing let me give you the<br>conclusion to that o-tar go study over<br>time causation has come to be applied in<br>a narrow technical and legalistic way<br>because of this any dispute with ACC<br>involves legal advice legal<br>representation and complex medical<br>evidence causation is inherently arguing<br>and difficult to assess this is redolent<br>of what we were trying to get rid of in<br>all of this<br>this is exactly the sort of thing that<br>the Woodhouse report was designed to<br>prevent now there are efforts are put to<br>improve the dispute settlement mechanism<br>but it when I last looked at it nothing<br>seems to eventuated despite all the work<br>that has gone into this now this brings<br>me to what is a really important and<br>critical element of this matter the<br>future pattern of income support and ACC<br>and the relationship between ACC and the<br>rest of the welfare state because this<br>has been through many iterations this<br>excellent compensation system but one<br>thing that has been constant in it is<br>that discrimination exists in public<br>programs between programs that relieve<br>some misfortunes but not others one<br>lottery replaced another the person laid<br>low by cancer a heart attack or a stroke<br>is treated much less generously the<br>person who suffers accidental injury and<br>the same with the same or similar<br>incapacity the first group of course is<br>impoverished by dropping income compared<br>with the person on AC C and as<br>professors Walter Blum and Harry Calvin<br>who Morrowind met at the University of<br>Chicago and he met them because of what<br>they'd written on automobile plans in<br>the United States then on no-fault<br>they said this and I quote private law<br>cannot borrow goals from public law<br>fields without accepting the obligation<br>to make a proper public law analysis in<br>the case of automobile compensation plan<br>such analysis shows that the special<br>problem cannot be solved adequately<br>without solving the larger problem what<br>is<br>larger problem poverty and that is the<br>difficulty that we're still in the<br>discrimination revolves around the fact<br>that in 1975 there was an election<br>campaign with superannuation for people<br>over the age of 60 the most important<br>was the most important issue in that<br>campaign and the the fact that we got<br>New Zealand superannuation removed any<br>possibility of having any money to do<br>anything in relation to this for a long<br>time afterwards and of course the<br>efforts made to do that we had the<br>Thaddeus McCarthy's Royal Commission on<br>Social Security 1972 but he didn't deal<br>with this so I have a Richardson's Royal<br>Commission on Social Security on much<br>wider issues far too many wide issues<br>did deal with it but didn't get anywhere<br>the fourth Labour government did<br>introduce a rehabilitation and then<br>incapacity built in 1990 that was based<br>on a law Commission report that was<br>authored by Sir Aaron Woodhouse when he<br>was chair of the law commission and that<br>bill was designed to extend the scheme<br>to sickness but it wasn't proceeded with<br>by the incoming national government so<br>the Australian wood House report was<br>designed to overtake the Social Security<br>system there and put in this new system<br>that was based on the 1967 Woodhouse<br>report in New Zealand but for a number<br>of reasons the aim of integration has<br>never been achieved and those issues<br>need to be addressed because serious<br>social inequalities stress stem from the<br>preferential treatment enjoyed by<br>accident victims not only in income<br>support but also in the rehabilitation<br>that is available to them now I come to<br>another mystery<br>the Social Security Act 1964 that has<br>recently been rewritten by the New<br>Zealand Parliament and it's quite an<br>interesting Act III notice that there<br>are distinguished judges in the audience<br>and and some of them had been very<br>critical of the of the Social Security<br>Act and be and I say the 90 in an<br>article a few years ago it's been a<br>convoluted mess for many years despite<br>its vital importance to many thousands<br>of people in fact it was the top<br>candidate for the booby prize of the<br>worst Statute on New Zealand books and<br>the Social Security rewrite bill which<br>has got a convoluted history all of its<br>own that was introduced under the<br>national government and it was passed by<br>the Edurne government only a week or two<br>ago and we recently had a function in<br>Parliament about the 80th the 80th<br>celebration for the Social Security Act<br>in which I said there was unfinished<br>business but remember what Anne Tolley<br>said when she introduced the Social<br>Security rewrite bill this is a classic<br>this bill she said rewrites the Social<br>Security Act 1964 after more than 50<br>years the Social Security Act is long<br>overdue for a rewrite when it was first<br>passed and at 135 sections it has since<br>grown to five hundred and twenty three<br>sections and of those only four remain<br>unchanged 214 sections have been<br>repealed and most sections have been<br>amended modal with multiple times in one<br>case 286 times altogether this makes for<br>a very disjointed and confusing bill she<br>was absolutely right<br>and the rewrite bill was intended to be<br>policy neutral the Labour Party however<br>voted against because it contained it a<br>number of new measures they didn't agree<br>with the iodine government took those<br>out by supplementary order paper but the<br>National Party voted against it because<br>it didn't agree with some of the things<br>they put it but anyway it was passed and<br>it is a policy policy neutral act and it<br>doesn't contain the views of any one<br>political power<br>and it's or its reorganization and it's<br>a long long act it's real organization<br>makes plainer the current landscape and<br>structure of the law and this does I<br>think make clear the issues and problems<br>of the current law and what is needed to<br>make coherent change I mean you even<br>have things like the winter energy<br>payment coming in here now in the 28th<br>of May the two ministers Colonel Sifl<br>only and Jen lo he said they would set<br>up a welfare expert advisory group to<br>focus on a number of issues that need<br>attention here there's a lot more work<br>to do in this area but I don't see any<br>move to integrate accident compensation<br>to the rest of the welfare system there<br>are a lot of other issues as will I've<br>already dealt with the difficulties<br>about disputes which the two systems<br>share and you only have to look at<br>justice Paul Davidson's recent decision<br>it was on a case dated from the height<br>from the tribunal where he had to look<br>at where the loans were income for the<br>purposes of the Social Security Act and<br>and that's you know when you read that<br>decision you wonder where are we getting<br>to when I was an MP I couldn't I<br>couldn't understand how it was the<br>constituents could be advised by reading<br>the Social Security Act you just<br>couldn't do it we were able to purloin<br>or otherwise acquire a copy of the<br>manual which was kept under lock and key<br>in those days and once we got a copy of<br>the manual Margaret who did a lot of the<br>work on this sitting in the front row<br>here we were able to give to get some<br>money for the constituents it was really<br>helpful but you know that is not the way<br>that things should be conducted now I<br>want to say he that it's hard to resist<br>the conclusion that income support<br>programs in New Zealand had developed in<br>a haphazard and unprincipled way that is<br>both confusing and unnecessarily content<br>complicated earnings related benefits<br>for accident victims with some lump sum<br>compensation and non-economic losses<br>provided under a cc flat rate income<br>tested benefits are provided for those<br>who are sick or otherwise incapacitated<br>then there is a generous Universal<br>scheme for those over the age of 65<br>that's in a different statute and has<br>different tests and different<br>adjustments for inflation and a whole<br>lot of unfair things like that there's<br>just no consistency and I think<br>substantial evidence is available that<br>the future demographic pressures are<br>going to render that scheme<br>unsustainable we've also got a KiwiSaver<br>Act which is designed to make it more<br>sustainable but you know when I lived in<br>United States<br>I taught property law in property law in<br>the United States's but like English<br>feudalism it's still based on on those<br>structures they never had the 1926<br>English property Law Reform Act and I<br>went an article in a Yale Law Journal<br>called the new property by Professor<br>Charles Reich in which he said look what<br>we've got here is a whole lot of things<br>which are like new feudalism the<br>relationship of the citizen to the state<br>is a sort of vassalage state and and I<br>think an objective observer would be<br>pardoned for thinking that the entire<br>income supports a Zeeland amounts to a<br>new form of feudalism where different<br>classes of people are subject to unequal<br>distinctions lacking in principle the<br>state provides for some people but with<br>different hoops to be jumped through<br>with different results depending on the<br>amount of help available and the<br>dependence on the state is so strong<br>that it's important that the law<br>governing these matters be free from<br>discretion as possible that it's clearly<br>stated and that it's fair now if you<br>look at the work and income website you<br>will find there 62 different benefits<br>and payments that people<br>can apply for the variety is just<br>remarkable then you've got the Inland<br>Revenue Department they've done work on<br>the five social policies they administer<br>for working for families child support<br>student loan payments in KiwiSaver and<br>in 2017 the IRD did a paper saying<br>making tax simpler better administration<br>of Social Policy now I think that shows<br>you the challenges involved and<br>delivering social policies within a tax<br>administration program and the need for<br>improvements so we've got a families<br>program that provides for a variety of<br>tax credits for families generous income<br>levels depending on the number of<br>children and and then we've got the<br>veterans program for pensions of them<br>when I was at the Law Commission we<br>redid the veterans legislation and<br>that's recently been reviewed now when<br>you consider the totality of the income<br>support system it could be seen I think<br>as evolving towards something quite<br>fresh either a negative income tax<br>system or looked at another way a<br>guaranteed minimum income such an<br>approach does not look out of the<br>question when one examines these<br>disparate newzealand support programs<br>that really don't conform any more to<br>any ascertainable principle that I can<br>see indeed it's been stated that the<br>income of a beneficiary needs to be<br>reframed as an income the recipient is<br>titled - as an economic unit in New<br>Zealand society I think the need to<br>produce some coherence out of these<br>disparate programs is pressing the<br>present pattern is and the antithesis of<br>joint up government and it ought not to<br>be beyond us to review this joint<br>disjointed program that provided a<br>unified integrated scheme for income<br>support for all forms of disability and<br>retirement on the basis of carefully<br>articulated principles we should make<br>them as free from discretion as possible<br>and we should have them as free from<br>legalism as possible but we need fair<br>dispute settlement mechanisms with<br>proper statutory interpretation<br>now obviously any re-engineering of the<br>New Zealand welfare state is going to be<br>difficult but at present matters are<br>confused and complex and we need a new<br>simplicity based on fairness now there<br>are a lot of problems to be confronted<br>when you do this increased life<br>expectancy poses serious issues for the<br>universal retirement income the overall<br>affordability is you will always be<br>present given the high cost of transfer<br>payments what can be afforded and how<br>does it rank in terms of political<br>priorities is an issue that is never<br>going to go away<br>then there's the future of work and the<br>degree to which new technology may<br>render jobs more scarce and that has to<br>be affected into the UK into the<br>equation an accident compensation did<br>take income support to higher income<br>brackets is this preferable that has to<br>be asked to redistribution to the less<br>well-off lives levels of immigration<br>posed issues as well what are our<br>obligations to people who arrive here<br>and what about the prospects of<br>increased migration that will core be<br>caused by climate change in the future<br>well there are as I will say in the<br>conclusion some lessons for policymakers<br>in New Zealand from this Cook's tour of<br>50 years of New Zealand confusion there<br>are important lessons here unexpected<br>results come with any scheme of this<br>character lofty aims can easily be blown<br>off course changing political ideologies<br>administrative blunders and constant<br>legend sort of fiddling lead over time<br>to incoherence I've got a whole other<br>lecture about how we make law in New<br>Zealand but I won't bother you with that<br>now but but what we're talking about is<br>really suffers from our failure to make<br>law properly<br>climates have in it have encountered in<br>the excellent compensation scheme<br>serious difficulties in securing quick<br>and fair decisions from a scheme that<br>promised to provide decisions without<br>technicality lines have been drawn<br>as the policy now stands but those lines<br>between injury and disease are<br>frequently problematic and seem very<br>unfair to claimants the impact is of the<br>scheme on the public health system needs<br>to be thought about the encouragement<br>that the scheme has provided to private<br>medical practitioners flowing from ACC<br>paying for treatment and private<br>hospitals and for rehabilitation to get<br>people back to work is a significant<br>issue and the ACC has challenged the<br>public health system in many ways to a<br>degree and it has I think assisted the<br>development of private health providers<br>know that not might not be a bad thing<br>but for all of all of this the welfare<br>state that we have has become<br>increasingly incoherent now of course<br>the scheme has improved the plight of<br>accident victims compared with what was<br>available at common law many people can<br>claim and have their hardship relieved<br>yet there have been persistent<br>criticisms of ACC in recent years about<br>how these lines are drawn how the<br>medical issues are assessed and there<br>been changes in administration and<br>decisions of ACC have become more<br>restrictive and similar to a liability<br>insurance scheme not a social insurance<br>scheme<br>now the woodhouse report made clear the<br>recommended scheme was to be temporary<br>order of things because he saw and<br>envisions it being extended to sickness<br>and until that discrimination is removed<br>social justice will not have been<br>achieved the abandonment of tort actions<br>remains the most legally significant<br>aspect of the scheme and the policy of<br>rejecting the tort system has been a<br>constant feature of the New Zealand<br>landscape since the enactment of the<br>scheme but in no other common law<br>jurisdiction has that been achieved I<br>think the ultimate issue<br>that is raised by the accident<br>compensation saga is one of social<br>philosophy the 1967 Woodhouse report was<br>based on the principle of community<br>responsibility the question is how<br>should that principle be translated for<br>a different world more than 50 years<br>doubt of the report we do not seem to be<br>willing to grasp the nettle and design<br>what is a rational and humane system of<br>income support we seem to have lost our<br>mojo when it comes to big reforms<br>fairness demands of policy response and<br>one that has worked through that is what<br>the Woodhouse legacy is saying to us<br>today if only we would listen the<br>Woodhouse vision was admirable the<br>performance of the scheme that was<br>adopted and proved matters substantially<br>for accident victims but there is<br>unfinished business the future remains<br>uncertain what we need is a fresh<br>infusion of woodhouse boldness and<br>vision thank
