She also reflects upon the need to respect and take account of the role of emotion in our responses to the world and of our experiences of it. <br><br>The dangers of giving ground to a new, post-truth order of public debate are recognised in President Obama’s call to arms: If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. On the face of it, in response to such a call, there is an urgent need to reassert the value of good argument and of critical thinking. Indeed, in the present environment in which governments present alt facts, and mainstream journalism is disparaged by some politicians, critical thinking is being seen by some as a form of activism. But the echo chamber of social media news coverage makes it harder to acquire and employ the skills and habits of mind of which responsible and critical inquiry are comprised.<br><br>Dr Bowell holds the position of Pro-Vice Chancellor Teaching and Learning at the University of Waikato. Previously she was Senior Lecturer in Philosophy in the Philosophy Programme at Waikato. She holds a BA (Hons) from the University of Sussex, an MPhil in Philosophy from the University of Cambridge, and a PhD from the University of Auckland.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

it's very close<br>second I think 300 enrollments and<br>registrations in a row we cut them off<br>you don't see this in Hamilton we're<br>living in some strange times it's an era<br>of post truth assertions of alternative<br>facts allegations daily of fake news<br>witch hunts and the like various groups<br>possibly state-sponsored are using or<br>manipulating social media to try to<br>influence elections in the US and<br>elsewhere<br>conspiracy theories abound on the right<br>and the left and who knows where else in<br>times like this it becomes all the more<br>important to teach people good reasoning<br>skills critical thinking and responsible<br>inquiry and this is the topic of<br>tonight's talk by Tracy bol Tracy is the<br>pro vice-chancellor of teaching and<br>learning at the University of Waikato<br>her research interests include critical<br>thinking and argumentation she is the<br>co-author with is a Gary Kemp of a book<br>entitled critical thinking a concise<br>guide thinkit's into the fourth edition<br>you should have Roth copies and signed<br>them here in the lobby Tracy did her<br>MPhil at Cambridge and her PhD in<br>philosophy at the University of Auckland<br>and before becoming PBC she was a senior<br>lecturer in philosophy so would you<br>please join me in welcoming my<br>good evening and can i echo cannon thank<br>you for coming out on a Monday evening I<br>hope that I'll make it worth your while<br>or if I don't at least the scones will<br>have done so I want to confront this<br>topic from the point of view of an<br>educator and from the point of view of<br>someone who claims at least to be a bit<br>of a specialist in critical thinking in<br>reasoning and in argumentation and as<br>Ken is sort of already foreshadowed<br>we're living in a time that provides us<br>or public debate provides us with plenty<br>of material as people interested in<br>reasoning and critical thinking and<br>argument so it provides us with plenty<br>of material and plenty of very meaty<br>examples when we give talks like this or<br>work with students but it can also send<br>you into despair a little bit from time<br>to time and so there are always plenty<br>of each week there are new moments that<br>send us into despair and here was one<br>very recently and this one is especially<br>for Ken he's much you would have that<br>you guys have not delayed the<br>interviewing the negotiation yes each<br>time by three or four days so we could<br>write a letter in response they have<br>taken two to three weeks to get back to<br>us<br>so what I have to tell you is look I'm<br>not going to be rushed into having him<br>testify so that he gets trapped into<br>perjury and when you tell me that you<br>know he should testify because she's<br>gonna tell the truth that he shouldn't<br>worry well that's so silly because it's<br>somebody's version of the truth not the<br>truth he didn't have a a conversation<br>this crowd I don't mean to go like I<br>know it isn't truth truth isn't truth<br>the predication stage says I didn't<br>truth is a truth mr. mayor do you<br>don't do this to me don't restrain<br>Donald Trump says I didn't talk about<br>Flynn with Comey<br>Comey says you did talk about it so tell<br>me what the truth is time to gain by if<br>you're such a genius John begins Don<br>McGee doesn't know if that's the case<br>situation if they have to Peters of<br>evidence Trump says I didn't tell him<br>and the other guy says that he did say<br>it which is the truth because you people<br>I know you're right I don't read minds<br>on that so so that one<br>there's rudy geude yani should have said<br>they're beginning and truth isn't truth<br>so so so then but but then I sort of<br>noticed a bit earlier a year around the<br>time that US universities in particular<br>had big graduation ceremonies what they<br>call commencement ceremonies and in they<br>will invite usually incredibly famous<br>people to give the commencement speech<br>and through those there was a theme and<br>I saw actually you know an article I saw<br>it and find it in Time magazine examples<br>of at least a dozen speeches where there<br>was this emphasis on returning to values<br>of truth and to the importance of facts<br>and so here's a couple of those to<br>uplift us and take us back to the<br>importance of truth and this is this is<br>Rex Tillerson who was was until<br>relatively recently Trump's Secretary of<br>State I am not sure how many he's had if<br>our leaders seek to conceal the truth or<br>we as people become accepting of<br>alternative realities that are no longer<br>grounded in facts then we as American<br>citizens are on a pathway to<br>relinquishing our freedom when we as<br>people of free people go wobbly on the<br>truth even on what may seem the most<br>trivial of matters we go wobbly on<br>America and so and because everyone<br>needs a little bit of Oprah on a Monday<br>night<br>sorry you can't go anywhere you can't<br>stand in line at Starbucks you can't go<br>to a party if you can't go to any place<br>without everywhere you turn people are<br>talking about how bad things are how<br>terrible it is and this is what I know<br>the problem is everybody is meeting<br>hysteria with more hysteria and then we<br>just are all becoming hysterical and<br>it's getting worse what I've learned all<br>these years is that we're not supposed<br>to match it or even get locked in to<br>resisting or pushing against it we're<br>supposed to see this moment in time for<br>what it is we're supposed to see through<br>it and then transcend it that is how you<br>overcome a stereo and that is how you<br>overcome the sniping at one another<br>patrolling the mean-spirited<br>partisanship on both sides of the aisle<br>you make the choice every day every<br>single day to exemplify honesty because<br>the truth let me tell you something<br>about the truth the truth exonerates and<br>it convicts it disinfects and it<br>galvanizes the truth has always been and<br>will always be our shield against<br>corruption our shield against greed and<br>despair the truth is our saving grace<br>and not only are you here USC Annenberg<br>to tell it to write it to proclaim it to<br>so when you may have seen in the<br>publicity at some of the publicity<br>materials for this talk a quote which<br>comes from President Obama if we're not<br>serious about facts and what's true and<br>what's not<br>if we can't discriminate between serious<br>arguments and propaganda then we have<br>problems and way back in 1951 in her the<br>origins of totalitarianism Hannah Arendt<br>the German philosopher already started<br>to identify I was identifying the<br>consequences of not paying heed to the<br>importance of the truth and keeping to<br>the facts the ideal subject of<br>totalitarian rule is not the convinced<br>Nazi or the convinced communists but<br>people for whom the distinction between<br>fact and fiction and the distinction<br>between true and false no longer exists<br>and a more even more recently so I just<br>read just last week there were 37 deaths<br>in Europe in the first six months of<br>this year from measles<br>they were hunt there were 41 thousand<br>cases of measles this until in in the<br>first six months of this year in Europe<br>and that's against 38 deaths in the<br>whole of last year and people who know<br>way more about these things than I do<br>put that down to the anti-vaccination<br>movement and the the success of that<br>rhetorical call to the to distrust<br>encouraging people to distrust expertise<br>to distrust medical expertise the<br>rejection of authority are sort of and<br>that the misplacement of populism in<br>that and the really in the face of or in<br>current that encourages the rejection of<br>authority so some very immediate and<br>consequences with that with<br>life-and-death consequences that we're<br>seeing in parts of the world where you<br>would expect that measles have been more<br>eradicated so that's byway and to sort<br>of get us going to warm ale warm us up<br>and encourage our palates if you like<br>this is how the rest of the talk is<br>going to pan out so I'm going to talk<br>first of all not for too long about what<br>I understand as critical thinking as an<br>expert in in the field and in the<br>context of how we teach critical<br>thinking in the university context then<br>I'm going to talk some more about the<br>challenges to good critical critical<br>thinking posed by the current state of<br>public debate and then I'm going to talk<br>about two problems that we actually<br>discuss in the research around critical<br>thinking but very very closely tied to<br>very closely tied to the way that we<br>teach critical thinking so what's called<br>the problem of transfer and I'll explain<br>what that is shortly and the problem of<br>beliefs that we hold very deeply and<br>then I'll in sort of like it's not<br>really the second half maybe the sort of<br>last third of the talk I'm going to make<br>some suggestions about how we might<br>adapt the way that we teach critical<br>thinking in the way that we talk about<br>critical thinking but if you like the<br>way that we think of what truly critical<br>thinking is to better confront this era<br>of post truth that we find ourselves in<br>so I'm going to talk about what it is to<br>become a responsible Enquirer and how we<br>might encourage responsible Inquirer in<br>the acquisition of the right sorts of<br>habits and I'm going to talk a little<br>bit only a little bit about how we might<br>try better to take emotion into account<br>recognizing that a lot of the responses<br>that we see people making to within<br>public debate our emotional responses<br>and I've thrown in that word there it's<br>a very trendy word for researchers<br>effective so you might hear that word<br>affective responses for all intents and<br>purposes we're talking about emotional<br>responses so you're going to see a<br>series of I'm going to keep using slides<br>and<br>mostly their summaries of what I'm<br>saying so I'm not going to read them out<br>that would be a waste of your time we've<br>just hand out copies of the slide so I'm<br>going to elaborate quite a lot on what's<br>on the slides so I've been Ken sort of<br>already covered a bit of this but I've<br>got a pretty picture that he didn't have<br>so I've been teaching and researching<br>and critical thinking for 21 years now<br>they don't start trying to work out how<br>old I am on them I'm sensitive like<br>everybody else or that kind of thing<br>but I'm I am with with Gary Kemp<br>co-author of four editions of this book<br>with a fish the fifth edition on the way<br>and one of well officially a fifth<br>edition on the way in a month's time<br>with not very many words written but one<br>of the things that I think we're really<br>prompted to do is to think about how we<br>adapt that textbook how that textbook<br>needs to evolve to take account of its<br>its role in in guiding its readers and<br>indeed the people who teach from it<br>through where we're at now in this time<br>of post truth and all the facts and and<br>fake news so or allegations of fake news<br>so we should probably move on to my<br>explaining what I mean by critical<br>thinking and what what we mean that in<br>the context of educating and people in<br>critical thinking in that university<br>context so certainly being critical but<br>being critical within a particular<br>framework a framework of principles and<br>concepts that have their origin in<br>informal logic and so it's more than<br>being able to take a critical standpoint<br>so I think sometimes when we hear that<br>phrase critical thinking then in a very<br>general thing something they're very<br>round since it sounds like it's being<br>able to criticize things but it's it's<br>more than that these are principles and<br>concepts that tell us or set out a<br>framework for what an argument is and<br>whether or not it's more importantly<br>whether or not it's a good argument what<br>do we mean by argument<br>a claim so that the we argue for<br>something and what we argue for is a<br>claim that something is the case or<br>something should be believed or<br>something should be done and the other<br>part of that argument so that's what<br>we're claiming and the other part of it<br>are reasons that we give for believing<br>that thing or doing that thing or that<br>something is the case so another way of<br>thinking about reasons in the context of<br>argument is that their evidence evidence<br>for why we should do something believe<br>something so on and a good argument is<br>one that gives the right reasons and<br>cutting a whole book short the right<br>reasons are ones that are relevant the<br>whole all of the reasons will give us if<br>you like the full story of why something<br>should be done or believed or if the<br>case and they give warrant they give a<br>complete justification and they do that<br>through true statements so in short then<br>whether or not an argument is a good<br>argument whether we're giving somebody<br>good reasons for doing believing<br>something is a question of the structure<br>of the argument and a question of takes<br>us back again to truth and so when we<br>teach critical thinking one of our<br>primary goals as teachers for our<br>learners is that they become competent<br>in applying the concepts by which we<br>evaluate reasoning and we try as far as<br>possible to give them opportunities to<br>build their skills to the point where<br>they can apply those concepts and those<br>skills to real-world arguments so it<br>looks then on the face of it as though<br>which we would be equipping our learners<br>in critical thinking to deal with the<br>current moment but I think that the<br>present presents that was a bit clumsy<br>wasn't presents us it was not an<br>intended pun by any means<br>with some particular challenges it looks<br>as though critical thinking would be a<br>very powerful tool for combating post<br>truth denial of facts all facts Donald<br>Trump's claims of or all caps fake news<br>exclamation mark exclamation mark that's<br>his Twitter handle by the way case you<br>aren't following him I would like to but<br>social media in particular and I'm<br>thinking of you know social media<br>insofar as it provides a medium or media<br>for public debate and for public<br>exchange makes it more difficult before<br>social media opinions which we expressed<br>opinions through those sort of<br>traditional media through newspapers<br>through radio even through radio talk<br>through through the television and so on<br>the audience and and it's clear in those<br>contexts that when opinions are being<br>expressed that they were being expressed<br>as opinions and not as fact and the<br>audience for them was more limited their<br>shelf life is shorter so you might have<br>an opinion piece in a newspaper but<br>tomorrow it was around to fish and chips<br>or in the bottom of your dog box or<br>whatever now it's much easier to be<br>offensive or insulting and get away with<br>it<br>previously opinion was moderated by<br>editors of newspapers or by the<br>producers and hosts of talkback show I'm<br>sorry talkback radio shows where there<br>is moderation on social media it tends<br>to be much more of a light touch and you<br>know you'll see you know scenes of<br>controversies about whether certain<br>kinds of language and discourse are<br>moderated effectively or properly I've<br>said that the critical thinking is a<br>matter of true beliefs or how we reach<br>true beliefs on the basis of examining<br>them against the evidence but social<br>media provides us with this echo chamber<br>we<br>choose our sources of information and<br>sources of current affairs we choose who<br>to follow on Twitter who our friends are<br>on Facebook well I don't know we're not<br>actually on Facebook but I'd do it by<br>proxy my sons on Facebook so oh he can<br>find my friends baby photos for me that<br>Facebook watch reddit which reddit sub<br>groups to join and so on in my own a<br>coach among just the same as everybody<br>else my own echo chamber rings daily<br>with a clamor of tweets from the<br>Guardian and the New York Times<br>headlines about the disasters of brexit<br>Trump's latest sackings these latest<br>legal tussles about climate change about<br>poisonings allegedly perpetrated by<br>russians and so on and and and and the<br>myriad other ways in which the world is<br>apparently going to hell in a handcart<br>so within the echo chamber their own<br>opinions tend to be reinforced we get a<br>false impression of consensus on what<br>are actually quite can be quite<br>controversial view so we confront this<br>problem of quality of discourse and<br>quality in terms of how accurate and how<br>within that discourse our but it's also<br>a question of quantity there are so many<br>more sources of opinion now and of news<br>and current affairs<br>it appears much faster it's much harder<br>to fact-check<br>it's much harder to rebut it and of<br>course if you don't like what's in the<br>mainstream media then you can use social<br>media to counteract it so I don't know<br>if any of you been following the sort of<br>very now rather long-running situation<br>in the UK and the leader of the UK and<br>and sorry the leader of the Labour Party<br>in the UK Jeremy Corbyn and claims of<br>anti-semitism in that part in that in<br>the Labour Party Judith Judith Collins<br>and locally Judith Collins it's quite a<br>good example of someone who's who tries<br>at least sometimes successfully to use<br>social media to try and switch the<br>switch the dialogue in a different<br>direction to try and sort of the day the<br>the direction that the day's kind of<br>news coverage is taking and of course<br>Donald Trump is somebody who uses social<br>media keenly vigorously you might say so<br>I want to ask the question well what's<br>to be done and I'll emphasize that I<br>asked this question as an educator so<br>this is a question for me it's a<br>question that I've been preoccupied with<br>well I guess for a really long time<br>because that's why I'm sort of in this<br>business but particularly became<br>particularly acute on the morning after<br>the brexit vote and you can probably<br>tell from my accent that a long time ago<br>I did come over here from that sort of<br>part of the world and I was visiting<br>Germany at the time and on the day of<br>the referendum I'd been at dinner with<br>some friends and I'd reassured our<br>German friends that although the opinion<br>polls predicted a close result or on the<br>basis of what I'd been reading of course<br>what I've been reading comfortably<br>ensconced in my echo chamber my wishful<br>thinking in fact as it turned out to be<br>but a pro leave result seemed unlikely<br>so next day when the result was clear<br>most Germans simply couldn't comprehend<br>how things could have ended up this way<br>but the British could elect to abandon<br>what the German see as the European<br>project and retreating to what was seen<br>as little Englander isolation it seemed<br>beyond the realms of reason and as<br>someone who teaches and writes about<br>raising an argument I had to start<br>asking myself what kind of response what<br>kind of effective interventions critical<br>thinking in particular education more<br>generally could make or should make in<br>response to these sorts of events and of<br>course it turns it turned out that<br>wasn't to become that wasn't was to<br>become not the first of the shocking<br>events of 2016 on the political front so<br>on the face of it then critical thinking<br>is even more the importance of critical<br>thinking becomes even more acute and one<br>of the things that's quite positive is<br>that critical thinking is increasingly<br>recognized as important and valuable by<br>employers by those of us in in<br>universities who design curricula for<br>our students we'll talk about this as<br>one of the one of the graduate<br>attributes of things one of the sort of<br>sets of skills and knowledge that all of<br>our graduates of our of our degrees will<br>have so it's increasingly recognized as<br>what's often termed a soft skill and and<br>something that's key can be key to our<br>graduates employability but is the<br>standard approach to teaching critical<br>thinking to educating people to become<br>critical thinkers is it adequate to the<br>challenge that we find ourselves in in<br>2018 and is compelling to think it is<br>and there's some people bo Ellen Kemp<br>and they wrote I mean there's only 2015<br>it's a good reflection of the importance<br>of the skills that you're developing but<br>those in power sometimes fear the<br>effects of those who can think<br>critically about moral social economic<br>and political issues the ability to<br>think critically then is essential if<br>one is to function properly in one's<br>role as a citizen yep all well and good<br>but it's actually I think more<br>challenging and complex than the<br>standard textbooks and courses might<br>lead us to believe and that's not just<br>because of this post truth moment<br>although that has made this even more<br>acute as I said but it's because of<br>those two problems that are highlighted<br>on my outline slide as well the problem<br>of transfer and the problem or and a<br>problem of the threat of a failure to<br>elicit what a philosopher called Richard<br>Paul has called strong sense critical<br>thinking so let me tell you a little bit<br>about strong sense critical thinking and<br>why I think it's important that we adapt<br>our ways of teaching to try and with the<br>goal of helping people to develop the<br>ability to to be able to think<br>critically in this strong sense so Paul<br>is using this term strong sense to<br>describe a level of criticality at which<br>a person is able to apply the processes<br>and the principles of argumentation to<br>their own beliefs and commitments<br>particularly towards those beliefs that<br>are deeply held and shortly I'll talk a<br>little bit more about what deeply held<br>beliefs are and some examples of deeply<br>held beliefs so so to remove any and in<br>doing so remove any bias towards their<br>own beliefs so if you like turning<br>critical thinking in on yourself and<br>taking critical thinking to this level<br>is important if it is to become a<br>genuine life skill and to equip us to<br>participate in our communities that we<br>hope and we tell our students it will if<br>it's pretend if you like if it's<br>properly to become an aspect of our<br>ability to reason practically to to<br>reason our way to decisions about how we<br>should act so a few years ago with some<br>colleagues I was involved in some<br>research that where we where we actually<br>interviewed some students who had taken<br>our critical thinking course<br>and it was already my experience as a<br>critical thinking teacher that it's<br>actually quite difficult to bring<br>students to a place where they are able<br>and willing to reflect critically on<br>their own beliefs and so that's partly a<br>question of whether you can whether<br>though whether people where the learners<br>properly acquire the concepts and the<br>skills but it's also a question of<br>motivation and it's also partly a<br>question of their understanding and<br>expectation of themselves as learners<br>how far they're prepared to push<br>themselves and to push themselves beyond<br>that experience just in the classroom so<br>we undertook a research project to sort<br>of see to what extent almost this<br>suspicion was borne out in reality and<br>we're so so we interviewed students who<br>taken our our course there are one<br>semester course and we interviewed them<br>about the extent to which their thinking<br>had become more critical having<br>completed the course so we're asking<br>about to accept they think that I think<br>it's become more critical and we also<br>asked them about the extent to which<br>their reflection on their own deeply<br>held beliefs had become more critical we<br>explored that by setting up<br>conversations with the interviewer where<br>they were encouraged to use their<br>critical thinking skills to reflect on<br>and defend some or other belief that<br>they held deeply that they a belief that<br>they would be very loath to give up or<br>to have challenged and we we recorded<br>all of these interactions and we<br>transcribe them so we could go back and<br>look at them very carefully when we<br>finished conducting all of the<br>interviews and what we saw was that<br>overwhelmingly the people we interviewed<br>thought that they'd become more critical<br>so that they thought that had a good<br>effect on in this course that they've<br>done yet when we actually started<br>working with them and conversing with<br>them very few were able or indeed<br>willing to reflect properly critically<br>on their own beliefs and they tended to<br>if they could be moved to defend those<br>beliefs they tended to do so in ways<br>that were mounted to using<br>arguments so you can see can imagine<br>engendered quite a deep uneasiness for<br>me I felt an uneasy the course and<br>indeed the textbook didn't appear to be<br>successful in enabling most students<br>develop this aspect of practical<br>reasoning but more deeply there was an<br>uneasy that this the expectation that<br>transforming deeply held beliefs and I<br>promise I will get on to thinking about<br>what those are might be achieved via<br>standard critical thinking methods and<br>approaches that was somehow a bit<br>unreasonable on our part but also<br>somewhat naive now several participants<br>that we interviewed talked about<br>believes that they beliefs that they had<br>one phrase was imbibed with their<br>mothers milk beliefs that form part of<br>the framework from within which they<br>thought about and sought to understand<br>the world part of the ethos with which<br>they engaged with the world and with<br>with it with others so he's not to see<br>the role that some of these beliefs were<br>playing in people's lives and thinking<br>and that's something but so that's<br>something that we gained from them and<br>it's something that I'm going to come<br>back to once<br>in shortly but I want to talk first<br>about what we think what what a deeply<br>held belief might be what sorts of<br>things we might have deeply held beliefs<br>about and you'll see just on there the<br>transfer gap that's that's a phrase that<br>we use in the business if you like to<br>talk about this problem that we see<br>where the skills sort of remain in the<br>in the classroom they don't that we<br>don't seem to be successful in educators<br>in making that having enabling student<br>even students enough to be able to make<br>that transfer from a classroom into the<br>rest of their lives and that's what we<br>were seeing through those participants<br>so what sorts of things and probably<br>you're probably already sort of getting<br>some ideas about what kind of care what<br>sort of candidates there are for deeply<br>held beliefs but I think it can be a<br>very very broad range and there's no<br>fixed definition of a deeply held belief<br>there's no no fixed criteria for a<br>beliefs being deeply held their acquired<br>in various ways and their contents and<br>can be diverse so here are some<br>candidates some of these might surprise<br>you oh sorry that's the wrong way<br>so the building's not about to fall down<br>now I have to be a bit careful actually<br>where I am in New Zealand when I do that<br>but but but generally think about the<br>way that we walk around and we kind of<br>physically interact with the building<br>it's not something we're kind of this<br>guy for our heads all the time or the<br>building's not gonna fall down the<br>building's not gonna fall down but we we<br>move through it as though we're not at<br>risk from the building doing something<br>dangerous so so somewhere deep implicit<br>maybe is that belief so there's another<br>one this one's actually kind of famous<br>in philosophical literature so here's a<br>hand again not something we're kind of<br>appealing to all the time not something<br>that is front of mind<br>unless I do that now it is and we can<br>think of strange situations where a<br>belief like that might be from might be<br>front of mind but perhaps it's their<br>deeply-held in some way so here are some<br>of these more more the sort of thing<br>that you might<br>in the context of what I'm talking about<br>today so here's a hair I'm sorry men are<br>equal two women are equal to men in all<br>respects immigrations a threat to our<br>way of life human activity is not a<br>principal cause of climate change no one<br>knows if vaccines are really safe going<br>back to those anti-vaxxers the left is<br>soft in terrorism conservatives are<br>heartless and don't care about social<br>inequality so there's some sort of<br>things that you might see flying around<br>in public debate well you can see<br>they're quite diverse and they're often<br>held and defended passionately or held<br>and defended dogmatically they play may<br>play a fundamental role in the way we<br>represent the world to ourselves they<br>form part of a sort of framework within<br>which other thoughts and claims take<br>place and appear and occur and they're<br>part of the ways that we are within the<br>world with others and they influence our<br>social and political actions and we're<br>often emotionally attached to our deeply<br>held beliefs as some of though that<br>quote that I told you from our<br>participants it might because of the way<br>that they've been inquired and<br>reinforced by our upbringing and by<br>people who are in fluent influential in<br>our lives by our parents and family<br>members by teachers by religious and<br>cultural leaders or our social and<br>professional peers or because they've<br>been formed on the basis of our own<br>lived experiences and experiences that<br>serve consistently to reinforce them and<br>you can see you know from the candidates<br>that I've got up there you can sort of<br>you can see how some of those fit some<br>of these sort of brief narratives about<br>how we might have acquired these beliefs<br>so they're part of the framework but for<br>a lot of our cognitive and our emotional<br>development and we often feel that<br>invested in those beliefs such that<br>they're kind of almost part of our<br>identity so whilst there's no single<br>definition of what a deeply held belief<br>is you can see that they play<br>they have in common a role that they<br>play in our lives and in our thinking so<br>unsurprisingly so this is just my<br>summary of what I'm saying so<br>unsurprisingly given the ways in which<br>they tend to be acquired and given<br>unwillingness to subject them to any<br>very very much critical scrutiny they're<br>often prone to prejudice they're prone<br>to implicit bias they're prone to<br>confirmation bias - stereo and -<br>stereotypes or to sort of include<br>stereotypical thinking and they're<br>easily manipulated and so our tendency<br>to hold on to them tightly together with<br>an unwillingness to subject them to<br>reflection demonstrates a lack of<br>open-mindedness a lack of an openness to<br>entertaining some other contrasting<br>point of view and a sort of resulting<br>resistance to change but of course as a<br>social and emotional comfort in holding<br>on to beliefs that are shared by those<br>around us and by those with whom we<br>regularly interact so if our friends be<br>they actual friends or out if you like<br>digital friends our neighbors our family<br>our colleagues express and share the<br>view that for example migrants are<br>stealing jobs pushing wages down the<br>cause of increased crime likely<br>terrorists and so on then it's a<br>position that's easily entrenched in our<br>social interactions and in our<br>understanding of the world and if we try<br>to challenge that view then we take an<br>emotional and a social risk and moreover<br>to kind of go back to one of our<br>starting points our beliefs and opinions<br>are reinforced in the echoes echo<br>chambers of our social media feeds if we<br>have them so we're sheltered within the<br>echo chamber from societal cultural and<br>political difference that digital<br>dislocated nurse shields us from<br>encounter with a distant other who's<br>then we can then becomes a subject of<br>our fears and becomes demonized so I've<br>talked a lot about the problem I talked<br>about the problem sort of in the round<br>in terms of<br>the challenge of the present era and the<br>way that that's amplified by the way<br>that the contribution that social media<br>makes to shaping current affairs and<br>public debate and only did I mean when I<br>talk about they're about public debate I<br>am also kind of talking about that sort<br>of within social media kind of chat<br>groups Facebook reddit groups that kind<br>of thing that sort of debate that shades<br>across the public and the private so<br>which is another sort of distinction<br>that maybe it's getting blurred in the<br>current situation so I've talked about<br>that and then I've talked about the<br>problem of transfer that we which is a<br>problem of our own critical thinking<br>teaching approaches maybe and that is<br>not just a an experience that we had but<br>is kind of quite well documented in the<br>literature about teaching critical<br>thinking and then our and then I've<br>talked about a deeply held beliefs and<br>what can make them deeply held and the<br>emotional attachment we have to them so<br>having poured out to you all of these<br>problems in my sort of angst about that<br>here's some ideas about a way forward so<br>what we might improve and do better to<br>try and equip ourselves better in this<br>particular era so I start on that with a<br>passage from a Canadian philosopher<br>Lorraine code and she's talking about<br>what it is to be a responsible Noah she<br>uses this term intellectually virtuous<br>but I'm going to translate that for you<br>as being a responsible Noah so or<br>responsible Enquirer so the<br>intellectually virtuous person she<br>writes is one who finds value in knowing<br>and understanding how things really are<br>they resist the temptation to live with<br>partial explanations where fuller ones<br>are attainable so they want the full<br>picture they they resist the temptation<br>to live in fantasy or in a world of<br>dreams or illusion considering<br>considering it better to know despite<br>the tempting comfort and complacency the<br>life of tenth fantasy or illusion or<br>well tinged with fantasy or illusion can<br>offer so there's also partly about<br>avoiding self delusion so I think one of<br>that code captures him one of the<br>reasons that I use it kind of kick off<br>what I could use it to kick off this<br>last section of the talk is that she<br>captures the motivational elements of<br>what it is to be a good and infective<br>effective Enquirer it's not just a<br>matter of acquiring the skills of<br>inquiring and learning the concepts and<br>being able to apply them well but of<br>being motivated to do so and being<br>motivated to seek knowledge and<br>understanding so and there's actually<br>I'm sure some of you are spotting it<br>here there's quite an Aristotelian<br>flavor of this of what it is in the<br>round to live a good life in that sense<br>of a good life where you contribute to<br>your own flourishing but also to the<br>flourishing of the whole society and of<br>the your entire community and so again<br>there's sort of Socratic if you like<br>notion of what it is to live a good life<br>to what it is to be happy so I'm going<br>to break this down a bit using some<br>terms that we see within the work that<br>we do and inquiry but also in the work<br>that we that some people are doing in<br>theory of not<br>College which in the business of<br>philosophy we call epistemology but you<br>don't need to I just put the jargon out<br>there so but okay so so we here are some<br>habits of good inquiry that we call in<br>the literature reliable list and I don't<br>think it's really necessary to explain<br>that but you know in a private Q&amp;A we<br>might do that probably not in the public<br>one so to be a good knower then you have<br>good perceptual abilities or to be a<br>good Enquirer sorry you're good at<br>introspection your memory works well and<br>those of you who are at the previous<br>talk will have some insights into how<br>memory works and how memory doesn't work<br>your observational skills are strong and<br>you have the reason the ability to<br>reason deductive Lee and inductively so<br>these are all you'll have probably<br>notice these are all cognitive and<br>perceptual abilities there if you like<br>natural abilities but it's possible to<br>develop them and to improve them and and<br>arguably with respect to teaching good<br>reasoning that's what the principle goal<br>is to get people getting all of this<br>working well together and then sort of<br>supporting their deductive and inductive<br>reasoning but more crucially for what<br>I'm suggesting and I think much more<br>interestingly are these other habits so<br>the ability to recognize the salient<br>facts and properly weigh them up as<br>evidence and we can see how that's<br>relevant to what I explained good<br>argument was sensitivity to detail<br>open-mindedness the ability to be open<br>to points of view that are contact<br>contrast that might be the direct<br>opposite of those that you hold that you<br>may be hold very deeply and to be<br>willing also to give up your own deeply<br>held views in the in the face of<br>evidence against them<br>fairness humility but epistemic humility<br>so I said that we call theory of<br>knowledge epistemology so when we say<br>that something's epistemic it's just to<br>do with knowledge so this is this is<br>being humble<br>as a Noah in the context of inquiry so<br>it might be again it's sort of link to<br>that preparedness to offer up but then<br>relinquish your own opinions and views<br>or beliefs but also a willingness to<br>inquire of and from and learn from<br>anybody so as a teacher you might<br>display epistemic humility by your<br>through your willingness to learn from<br>your students for example so you're sort<br>of overcoming that the teacher-student<br>hierarchy and through and showing<br>humility so so really I mean humility<br>but in that context of inquiry okay<br>perseverance diligence care and<br>thoroughness the ability to recognize<br>reliable Authority so something we see<br>missing say in the case of the<br>anti-vaccination movement intellectual<br>candor so intellectual honesty and<br>openness intellectual courage autonomy<br>as an Enquirer and our creativity and<br>inventiveness and these these kind of<br>habits they sort of regulate the use of<br>our cognitive habits they constrain<br>communicative exchange they help us to<br>treat others properly within the course<br>of debate and exchange to take proper<br>account of the contributions that we all<br>make to inquiry to take proper account<br>of each other's opinions and beliefs and<br>but in order to acquire these habits<br>properly we need to practice and<br>practice requires motivation and I think<br>that the transfer gap is in part a lack<br>of motivation of being able to be<br>bothered to engage properly with an<br>argument especially if it's complex or<br>poorly expressed or delivered in certain<br>just not very pleasant tones and an<br>analog I think is in sports coaching and<br>sports training so as an athlete you<br>start from your natural cognitive and<br>physical faculties and then you develop<br>and home specific skills<br>specific skills specific to the<br>particular sport but that's not enough<br>you need persistence you need courage<br>you need humility in the face of defeat<br>and so on and it's something often if<br>you watch a lot of sport which I do I<br>watch a lot of tennis and and play a lot<br>of tennis too but if you listen to<br>commentators they'll often focus on that<br>they'll they'll talk about they'll talk<br>about technique and so on but they'll<br>also talk about the players emotions<br>they'll talk about the way that they<br>behave in these sorts of terms of<br>persistence and courage and so on so<br>what might that mean when we're helping<br>learners to become critical thinkers so<br>I think first and for know first and<br>foremost there's a need to be explicit<br>about developing those habits to say<br>from the outset that we need not only to<br>learn skills and concerts but we have to<br>become we want to try and become<br>responsible in our use of those and we<br>and I think that of those habits that I<br>showed you I think the most important<br>ones are open-mindedness in being<br>willing to examine and possibly give up<br>your own deeply held beliefs humility<br>being open to learning from others<br>asking questions listening being willing<br>to engage engage and to adopt someone<br>else's opinion being able to judge when<br>it's appropriate to defer to Authority<br>and when it might be more appropriate to<br>be courageous and to challenge authority<br>and to develop our autonomy as<br>Enquirer's so traditionally and so and<br>traditionally when we think about a good<br>and bad argument we we position argument<br>against emotion and what I've done mary<br>says there's a there's a core family of<br>juxtapositions where we make those<br>contrasts and you know emotions bad<br>reasons good and that's how would you<br>think about these things but in more<br>recent work in argumentation theory some<br>theorists argue for the legitimacy of<br>emotion within reasoning and within<br>argument they'd see it as not<br>they see emotion as not necessarily a<br>hindrance to good reasoning so fear and<br>anger for example might undermine good<br>reasoning and we see that a lot so in<br>the immigration case that I was sort of<br>throwing out there that deeply-held<br>those deeply held beliefs about that you<br>might someone might have about<br>immigrants then that that fear might<br>seem to undermine good reasoning but on<br>the other fear and anger might be quite<br>reasonable responses to some situation<br>and might therefore be able to have an<br>effective role in good practical<br>reasoning so in for example indignation<br>sort of righteous anger could often be a<br>quite rational response to situations of<br>reactions and they might trigger<br>appropriate changes to the way that we<br>think about the world and about the<br>sorts of actions that we need to take<br>and and some work in choice and also<br>some work in choice theory so outside of<br>philosophy but in psychology suggests<br>that emotion has an increasingly<br>significant role in decision-making the<br>more significant a decision is in the<br>scheme of our lives and the ways of<br>living so so so it's certainly important<br>I think when we think about good inquiry<br>good decision-making that we are making<br>space for emotion and recognizing when<br>people's reactions our emotional<br>reactions and how we can sort of<br>leverage off of those so by way of an<br>ending I want to take a case study and<br>and and I'm going to use this to show<br>what I think it's quite a good example<br>of taking account of the emotions of in<br>this case of some high school learners<br>I'm it's going to show us the role that<br>the learners deeply held beliefs play<br>and then I'm going to run through very<br>briefly how I think some responsible<br>inquiry is going on is taking place both<br>on the part of the teacher and on the<br>part of the learners so this is a story<br>about a<br>science teacher who was teaching senior<br>biology 217 students in a school that's<br>in a rural area of a heart oh hi Oh<br>which had had a very successful coal<br>mining industry but which is now in deep<br>decline and these students had had had<br>family members who were now unemployed<br>and been unemployed for you know we're<br>into sort of second generation of<br>unemployment through the closure of the<br>mines and they had formed students had<br>formed beliefs that emissions from<br>burning fossil fuels were not causally<br>responsible were not had no causal<br>effect on the climate and I think in<br>some cases also they had the more kind<br>of more general belief that climate<br>change just wasn't real so so they had<br>these beliefs that were formed in the<br>environments of their families and their<br>communities they were very loyal to<br>their family in their communities and so<br>the teacher at first used scientific<br>evidence to try rationally to persuade<br>the street<br>it's of the falsity of their beliefs he<br>so your scientific evidence he is data<br>imagine him with his charts and his<br>graphs and so on<br>and the students would have a bar of it<br>their loyalty to their family outweighed<br>trying to take the reasonable response<br>they felt that they would be challenging<br>the community consensus so their<br>responses was sometimes quite extreme<br>and they in the in the counterfeit Irish<br>you know there was a case of a student<br>who ran away crying and never came back<br>so they were they were very moved and<br>but also quite upset by having to kind<br>of confront what they had these beliefs<br>that they had grown up with so so the<br>switches switch of a teacher he made a<br>switch from trying to work directly<br>about against their beliefs and against<br>their emotional responses by trying to<br>disprove them with more and more<br>scientific data he appealed to their<br>experience of the local climate he<br>reminded them that winter had bought<br>fewer snow days so they actually had to<br>come to school more because the school<br>was closed less often but spring had<br>bought the springs in recent decade or<br>so had brought more floods and then he<br>reinforced those sort of reminders if<br>you like by creating new experiences for<br>them so he took them to the woods and<br>they observed the destructive effects of<br>an invasive beetle that had previously<br>always died off in the winter but now<br>survives through the warmer winters and<br>therefore does a lot more damage so he<br>recognized the emotional weight of<br>students beliefs about climate change<br>and their suspicions of scientific<br>effort evidence and instead of just<br>presenting more and more statistical<br>evidence as if they would eventually bow<br>under its weight he enabled this<br>immediate experience and if you like to<br>put it simply he made it real for them<br>and now they could start to see and they<br>could start to feel what that data<br>represented so he acknowledged the role<br>of emotion in their thinking but he<br>avoided working directly against it and<br>in working directly against it was<br>risking reinforcing it risking that they<br>would just dig into those entrenched<br>positions that they<br>mostly grown up with so by recognizing<br>the emotional pull of those beliefs and<br>the emotional origin of those beliefs he<br>opened the students up to reason and<br>through what he did there I think as I<br>said I think we can also see both the<br>teacher and the students displaying some<br>traits and some of those habits of<br>responsible inquiry so the teacher<br>displays open-mindedness he's open to<br>changing the ways open mind insofar as<br>he open to changing the approach that<br>he's taken to the students he displays<br>humility so he in that sort of both in<br>that willingness to be open-minded but<br>also to sort of make the student the<br>center and to start from where they are<br>from where they are recognizing their<br>emotions he displays courage in being<br>prepared to give up or walk away<br>temporarily from the approach that he<br>would normally take and to see how this<br>different approach works and he<br>definitely displays perseverance to get<br>the students eventually to where he had<br>originally hoped to get them but the<br>students also eventually they become<br>open-minded their minds are opened to<br>reasoned arguments and statistical data<br>and evidence about climate change they<br>display courage in preparing being<br>prepared to start moving away from most<br>deeply held beliefs to which they're<br>emotionally attached they developed the<br>ability to recognize the salient facts<br>they deal ability and to recognize them<br>as evidence they developed the ability<br>to recognize Authority and they develop<br>their autonomy as Noah's and Inquirer's<br>and so so to so I think that's a as a<br>Ken's looking as what is it almost an<br>ending case study kind of captures some<br>of the ways I think that we might<br>resolve the challenges that this current<br>era presents to us as critical thinking<br>those what's a concern with how we best<br>teach and guide people to become good<br>critical thinkers<br>so I've argued that these sort of<br>transformational learning experiences<br>that involve performing open-mindedness<br>with respect to our own Shibboleth<br>require more than a court than requiring<br>good reasoning reasoning skills they<br>require acknowledging that they're<br>required sorry they require that we<br>develop certain dispositions of<br>responsible inquiry but also knowledge<br>require that we acknowledge that deeply<br>held beliefs can be motivated by<br>emotional responses that aren't<br>necessarily unjustified and that those<br>responses can themselves be reasonable<br>responses so while we should remain<br>serious deadly serious about facts and<br>about what's true and what's not in this<br>moment of post truth and I hope that it<br>is just a moment of post truth we need<br>to work as educators as scholars as<br>generally concerned members of the<br>community who are willing to take an<br>hour out on a Monday evening to you care<br>enough to come and listen to me talk<br>about this to to find ways to help each<br>other develop habits of responsible<br>inquiry that will confront<br>thanks for that we've got about 15<br>minutes or so for questions so we'll<br>open up to the floor um yes fantastic<br>does something I've wanted to know all<br>my life if you're an intp or<br>myers-briggs INTP for instance can you<br>train someone you know one of their<br>traits is seek to understand and not to<br>judge so people who judge straightaway<br>without any understanding can you train<br>them to be an INTP or not you just stuck<br>with that all your life born with it no<br>I surely you could surely you can<br>inculcate that by teaching people to<br>kind of come back from the brink would<br>be my immediate response I think I don't<br>think this you know in general why do we<br>educate if we what's the point<br>why do we think there's a purpose in<br>educating and turning people if we think<br>they're kind of stuck in those types so<br>that's the kind of very general response<br>to that but I think that we can sort of<br>we can train people to kind of control<br>that impulse to judge I mean someone's<br>to still try but to stay my impulse but<br>yeah kind of building not on that in a<br>sense so you focused a lot on obviously<br>the educators side of things which is<br>where you come from so that's kind of<br>focusing on the individual but I was<br>wondering about your thoughts on the<br>social environment which is a little bit<br>drawing on that so some of the terms you<br>used I was just kind of wondering how<br>they would apply more broadly so things<br>like open-mindedness and intellectual<br>humility I was thinking that when you<br>said intellectual courage I was<br>wondering if we might also need<br>intellectual patience to allow others to<br>kind of get to the point where they're<br>allowed to consider the facts make<br>errors and then have that safe space to<br>do so and also whether it's there for<br>maybe not in addition to a lack of<br>motivation if we could motivate people<br>maybe we also need to maybe there's a<br>lack of<br>mission to think critically and that's<br>why people could have hold so strongly<br>to their own beliefs I was wondering<br>your thoughts on that yeah okay good<br>it's a lovely question so start right at<br>the very beginning so you could take<br>some of those if you take the sort of<br>second list of the just of the habits so<br>I won't i won't waste of one's time<br>we're going back to the slide but those<br>ones that are said really the kernel of<br>being responsible Enquirer things like<br>open-mindedness and humility once you<br>mentioned then we can sort of think<br>about them in two different contexts so<br>we can think about them as when we're<br>just inquiring as an individual so in a<br>very simple case I've got some view<br>about climate change and then I'll go<br>and research it and then I still might<br>need to because I've got this view which<br>is sort of semi-fixed then it still<br>requires me to be open-minded and some<br>of those other things but I'm doing that<br>very much just in my response to the<br>material<br>yeah and then and then there's a<br>situation where where as a community or<br>as a group inquiring and then it becomes<br>then then those traits become not just<br>about my relationship so to the data or<br>to the evidence but they become about my<br>relationship to all of those people that<br>I'm inquiring with and so they become<br>not just ways of of regulating my<br>cognitive abilities but they become ways<br>of regulating my communication and my<br>relationships with them as well so I<br>think you're you're absolutely right and<br>on that score and then the last part of<br>the question was about giving ourselves<br>permission to be critical sort of as a<br>society and I think that we can maybe<br>connect that back to something I said<br>the very beginning about how I what I<br>don't mean by critical thinking which<br>has just so simply being critical for<br>the sake of it so I think we there can<br>be something of a sort of collective<br>fear of being critical being quick to<br>it's a barrier or an obstacle to being<br>properly critical thinkers and then the<br>other thing is goes to you mentioned<br>patients and I think that's absolutely<br>right you can think of that as so<br>patience is would traditionally be<br>thought of as a sort of moral virtue but<br>it probably has a place as a habit of<br>good inquiry as well I mean we need<br>patients when we listen to each other<br>properly for example but we also more<br>generally need patients to be critical<br>thinkers or critical Enquirer's in the<br>way that I'm talking about because it it<br>kind of take it takes time it's<br>deliberative and we often don't give<br>each other or ourselves that amount of<br>time and so and and and I think maybe<br>also there's kind of maybe somewhere<br>deep down we sort of know that this<br>could become kind of cognitively and<br>emotionally kind of uncomfortable for us<br>or sort of risky and that's maybe<br>another reason why as a society we just<br>don't want to go there thank you so much<br>for such a refreshing thing to talk<br>about truce and cognitive honesty could<br>you please tell me within the university<br>system how much influence do you have on<br>other lecturers to ensure that they have<br>critical thinking and that the truth is<br>fundamental to all their lectures is<br>there anyone who actually oversees that<br>to actually make sure that the<br>principles of truth and critical<br>thinking part of the university which<br>they always have been but seem to be<br>getting a bit lost at the moment okay so<br>all right so my my job part of my role<br>in that fancy chant of that fancy title<br>of pro vice-chancellor teaching and<br>learning is to encourage people to<br>develop good and best practice as<br>teachers so in the current in the<br>contemporary context quite a lot of that<br>is around how we make really good use of<br>technology I mean way beyond the sort of<br>rudimentary way that I was using some<br>videos there so that's a lot of what I<br>do but what I'm trying to say there<br>- is that that's in a very general sense<br>no one no one gets to kind of go into<br>each other's lectures and I mean we do<br>invite each other to listen but we're<br>not going around to check whether<br>someone's telling the truth but but let<br>me I don't know if this is where your<br>question was coming from but let me just<br>something that's been really troubling<br>me and I when I was working on this I<br>wrote a post-it note about it and now<br>I'm going to try and reconstruct them<br>what I scribbled on the post-it note and<br>let's see how this goes<br>gonna take a risk here so so okay so<br>from about 1960s 1970s post<br>structuralist and post modernist<br>theorists have started to talk well<br>started to talk about and people though<br>I mean this was in philosophy before<br>then but they sort of talk about the way<br>in which truths are constructed so it<br>wasn't just kind of we didn't just kind<br>of the idea was that we didn't just kind<br>of walk out and bump into the truth and<br>be confronted with it that it was kind<br>of completely independent of anything<br>that we did but in some respects it was<br>constructed and so then you sort of get<br>to the start to get to that start now<br>developing that and we start to get a<br>plurality of truths about the same thing<br>right so that's where that's where Rudy<br>mayor mayor Giuliani is going is<br>actually going in that video clip that<br>we saw and such as some extent that<br>thinking there's a lot of legitimacy in<br>that thinking so if if I'm a what does<br>that where does that just happened in<br>chemists in in in in the eastern part of<br>Germany what was the the communist part<br>of Germany before 89 there were recently<br>that there was just recently these<br>rights it's not going to be a very good<br>example but think think about this so so<br>the the refugee so they're there in in a<br>part of say a refugee who flexes affect<br>fixes up in Europe sorry what's the word<br>I want there who fetches up sorry<br>fetches up in Europe in a place where<br>they're not made particularly welcome<br>so there there's a truth from their<br>perspective if you like there's there<br>there's a truth about their experience<br>in that situation which is almost kind<br>of contrary to the truth that they're<br>the people already in the town if you<br>like experience so there's so I'm not<br>putting this very well I got my<br>colleague here Joe Oh toski from<br>philosophy who's an expert on truth so<br>that's kind of really helpful you cannot<br>know that so so so you've got you've got<br>this this this kind of shared experience<br>but there's one person's version of that<br>experience from their experience and<br>there's kind of quite a contrasting<br>experience okay so so part of what some<br>of that some of them that kind of<br>thinking about the fluidity of truth is<br>trying to kind of take account of is<br>that kind of situation so so I would say<br>that in order to have the full picture<br>there then we need to take account of<br>both of those experiences and then we<br>have something that's kind of messy and<br>difficult to work through but that is<br>the truth of the situation okay so and<br>then we start to work through which<br>parts of that illegitimate and which<br>parts aren't and I think that one of the<br>things that's happened in in the that's<br>taken us to the current where we are now<br>and where within public debate and where<br>something that sort of Fernet assists<br>and extremists are are leveraging off is<br>this kind of they've kind of taken on<br>this idea that they've sort of adapted<br>that idea to think well I can say this<br>really really controversial thing and<br>now I'll just label it as my truth and I<br>can get away with it and so on I think<br>that that's what's happening and I just<br>wondered whether so it's a very<br>roundabout way to answer your question<br>but I wondered if some of what what was<br>kind of prompting that question was some<br>thinking like that that there's this<br>kind of sort of rather illegitimate and<br>sort of gerrymandered ways that people<br>are trying to take advantage of that<br>kind of quite genuine idea that in a<br>complex situation there will be a whole<br>set of truths that may appear that<br>actually truth about the situation but<br>it may appear to cut across each other<br>and it sort of seems to give license to<br>one side simple as that but I think<br>that's a very big part of it and so one<br>of the places in my in my notes when I'm<br>talking about I don't think I'd she said<br>it but I had it scrolled down talk about<br>those sort of what I call the habits of<br>responsible inquiry it's partly just how<br>we treat each other as Enquirer's but<br>but and that you know and and a matter<br>of respect and anything if you look at<br>some of that discourse in in in social<br>media in life and trolling or even just<br>the comments you know you know could be<br>a media site that it's a kind of<br>respected you know sort of mainstream<br>media and look at the comments and<br>there's just a lack of respect for each<br>other that's then that's then licensed<br>by famous political figures and and<br>others so and that's kind of really<br>basic sort of quite a general point<br>about just the quality of debate and so<br>so it is a writ large it's a kind of<br>treated about treating each other<br>properly and I like that idea my idea<br>epistemic compassion so you have to tell<br>yeah yeah indeed and another whole part<br>of this which I didn't really talk about<br>is people are learning it's just kind of<br>people helping people to develop an<br>awareness and being able to steer their<br>way through that sort of navigating<br>negotiate their way through that sort of<br>messy soup of bias and opinion and<br>extremely held and controversial views<br>and so on and so that that would be a<br>part of this and one of the things I<br>thought of start to think a bit about as<br>I'm not I'm not a teacher educator in<br>the sense of school teaching but how do<br>you do that from quite a young age and<br>teach that sort of navigation and so<br>about a developing and awareness of<br>what's going on in those debates as well<br>and the ways that people communicate<br>okay well this kind of wraps up the<br>evening Tracy will be here for about<br>button<br>10-15 minutes if you want to come and<br>ask questions before we have to take off<br>Joanna wants to say something a bit<br>about the some of the next upcoming</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
