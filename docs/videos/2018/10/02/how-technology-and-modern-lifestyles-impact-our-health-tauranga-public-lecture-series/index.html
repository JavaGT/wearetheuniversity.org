Technology has had a huge impact on our lives and how we spend our time. Despite the medical breakthroughs and marvels of technology, the average human life span is decreasing.  We are bombarded by dietary advice, exercise recommendations, and tricks for healthy living, yet there is an obesity pandemic.<br><br>Join Dr Martyn Beaven on a journey with Florence Nightingale, Albert Einstein, Alan Alda and arctic reindeer, as he investigates the question of whether the technology that we have come to rely on is doing us more harm than good.<br><br>Dr Beaven is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Waikato Adams Centre for High Performance.  A chemistry graduate, he did his PhD in exercise physiology sponsored by the New Zealand Rugby Union. In 2012, he took up a post-doc position in Sweden working at the National Winter Sports Research Centre and was a recovery consultant to the Swedish Olympic Committee during the London Olympics. After his post-doc appointment he had a brief stint in Nebraska, before being invited to head the Strength and Conditioning Centre and Podium Programme at the National Sports Institute of Malaysia. A highlight of his time there was working with the Paralympic team that won Malaysiaâ€™s first ever gold medal at the Rio games. Dr Beaven recently moved home to take up his current position at Adams Centre for High Performance.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening it's great to see so many<br>people here today it's not any<br>intimidating it all up here so I've got<br>a bit of a provocative title there my<br>computer once me did and probably the<br>majority of the time that's not true<br>but but sometimes it is true for ya but<br>it really is an exciting time as Joanna<br>said the University of Waikato coming<br>into the bay the great new facilities in<br>the center of town really are going to<br>be a centerpiece for the University of<br>Waikato and we're super excited I'm<br>based out at Blake Park the Adams center<br>for high performance there and we're<br>really lucky to be alongside some some<br>great and dedicated athletes training<br>out of there and that there's a really<br>great feel of it she got a couple of PhD<br>students in the audience up the back<br>there thanks for coming along Francesco<br>and Ivana so right up front I want to<br>say that I'm I'm a PhD I'm not a medical<br>doctor<br>I'm going to present some information<br>today which I find really interesting<br>but I they're just sort of suggestions<br>and guidelines I'm not going to be<br>telling you medical advice and I want to<br>sort of stress that a little bit like<br>say we have a talented team out at the<br>Adams center you may have been along to<br>one of the lectures already by dr. Kim<br>Nabil oza who gave a talk on running<br>earlier in the year and we have a couple<br>of other great doctors out there that do<br>some really great stuff I'm gonna<br>introduce myself a little bit here can<br>we all hear okay yep so yeah I'm Matt<br>and I'm originally from Rotorua so yep<br>go the bago the steamers I came to the<br>University of Waikato from Rotorua and<br>studied a Bachelor of Science in<br>technology in chemistry feels like a<br>long time ago I went away and worked in<br>chemistry for a little while and then I<br>was fortunate enough through a change in<br>circumstance to be able to sort of take<br>some of the expertise that I gained<br>during that time working and combine<br>that with a passion of mine which is<br>sport in in high-performance sport and I<br>was able to do a master's in sports<br>exercise study at one Tech who Hearst<br>the opposition same for a aut Buddhist I<br>did my my my PhD through aut and was<br>four<br>shouldn't have to be supervised by dr.<br>Nicholas Gill who's the current strength<br>and conditioning coach for the All<br>Blacks<br>after that I was very fortunate actually<br>I picked up a post doctorate in Auster<br>shunned in the middle of Sweden people<br>from Stockholm would say it's very North<br>Sweden but actually it's almost exactly<br>in the geographical center of Sweden<br>about six hours north from Stockholm on<br>a train yeah it's pretty cold I was<br>there for a couple of years and then I<br>had the opportunity to moved to the<br>athletic performance lab in Lincoln<br>Nebraska America so go go big red and I<br>worked there as a physiologist for some<br>time and then was offered a job to come<br>to Kuala Lumpur the iesson or<br>Institute's again the gada<br>the National Sports Institute of<br>Malaysia where I was the head of<br>strength and conditioning so there's a<br>few teams there that I've worked with<br>through the years been very fortunate to<br>work with some great and dedicated and<br>passionate people but probably they're<br>one of the highlights of my career today<br>- in sports exercise science would be<br>the time I spent with some of these para<br>athletes in Malaysia I'm not sure you<br>probably don't recognize these three<br>guys Malaysia had never won a gold medal<br>prior to the Rio Olympics so here we<br>have Ziad Rizwan koozie who won the<br>hundred metres fastest guy in the world<br>he had a world record shot put and Latif<br>romli world record and gold medal<br>obviously in the long jump seven meters<br>60 or thank you jump so this is me and<br>I've got a big light bulb next to my<br>head which generally shows that I've had<br>a great idea not in this case sorry I'm<br>really sorry about that basically I just<br>wanted to talk to you a little bit today<br>and it's sort of a bit of a story and<br>I'll tell you a bit of the story of how<br>I came to be telling you this story<br>today just through maybe my time in<br>Sweden and also some other things that I<br>learned through drink doing my PhD but I<br>think we all know that the world we live<br>in today is very very different to the<br>world we lived in<br>or our parents lived in and with the and<br>your grandchildren obviously experienced<br>you know very different life's to what<br>you had growing up so that presents a<br>lot of challenges it's great there's a<br>lot of exciting opportunities there are<br>jobs that exist now that never existed<br>before but there's also a lot of<br>challenges associated with the change in<br>our lifestyle and were a little bit more<br>sedentary now I'd say some in some ways<br>that the modern lifestyle hasn't really<br>been as beneficial for us as some people<br>might think so I'm just going to talk<br>through a little bit of a story and so<br>this is a really strong chicken so when<br>I was doing my PhD I had to do a<br>literature review and I was working with<br>rugby players we were talking at<br>testosterone and how we can make sure<br>we're maximizing testosterone because<br>that's a great way of building muscle is<br>a great way of being able to maintain<br>and so I was just doing a little bit of<br>reading you know as a diligent student<br>obviously<br>and I came across this really amazing<br>study have blue light could really<br>influence the amount of muscle mass in<br>the subjects of this study<br>that's why well this is amazing why<br>people not why did why do people not<br>know about this but the trouble was it<br>was in the Journal of poultry research<br>so so it was in chickens so so that<br>would grow these chickens and that<br>learnt that over time the chicken farms<br>had learned that if they put a blue<br>light 10 centimeters above the heads of<br>these chickens as they were growing then<br>they would get much much more muscular<br>which is great for chicken farmers<br>because that's the meat that they're<br>selling to you and me to eat yeah so and<br>they would they actually did an<br>experiment it showed if you use green<br>light if you used red light if you use<br>blue light or you just use normal light<br>these chickens would be about 20% have<br>about 20% more meat on them if they were<br>grown under blue light and that was<br>related to testosterone and the<br>testosterone that was flowing through<br>the earth their blood was that much<br>higher in those chickens so that's sort<br>of opened my eyes a little bit to the<br>effect so that light can have and I sort<br>of started looking into other effects<br>that yeah light might have on the body<br>and so this is our ROYGBIV we all know<br>the the rainbow so blue lights sort of<br>at the top end there as we'd call it a<br>short wavelength light as opposed to red<br>which is more of a long long wavelength<br>obviously infrared would be off the<br>bottom there and ultraviolet would be<br>off the top and just learning about the<br>some of these effects of light on the<br>body that aren't just related to how we<br>perceive things how we see things so<br>that's called the non-image forming<br>effects of light I like to liken that to<br>our ears so we know our ears are useful<br>for hearing but we also know that our<br>ears help us with our balance and being<br>able to mane<br>now balance their ears have these two<br>two uses the same with our eyes so our<br>eyes are used to be able to see and<br>perceive things but they also take in<br>this other information from right that's<br>not actually to do with seeing it's<br>actually to do with being able to know<br>what time of day it is when we should be<br>going to sleep when we should be up when<br>we should be out foraging or working or<br>getting to work AP nine o'clock so when<br>I learned about this the effects of blue<br>light in chickens I actually learnt a<br>little bit about how blue light can<br>influence a range of things including<br>our cognition but also how red light<br>makes has these effects and can actually<br>penetrate our skin and is actually quite<br>useful in some forms of pain management<br>so so this red and blue they're not just<br>useful for telling which Smurfs is the<br>most important so one of the key studies<br>that I looked at or found came out in<br>1991 was in the Journal of comparative<br>physiology and they were looking at the<br>effects of this very specific wavelength<br>of light the blue wavelength of light on<br>blind mice I didn't actually bother to<br>look up how many mice they used but I'm<br>so now we know that mice nocturnal so<br>they're up and about during the night<br>time that's where they scurry around and<br>steal the cheese and during the data and<br>they're pretty inactive that's when<br>they're sleeping in because they're<br>nocturnal they don't really rely on<br>sight<br>very much so your average Mouse is<br>actually technically blind if you if you<br>put up this the Snellen chart the I<br>versions chart there they don't have<br>20/20 vision what they have 2200 vision<br>so 20/20 vision means that if you're 20<br>feet away you can read that line what is<br>it 4 lines up from 6 meters away when<br>you're at the doctor's chat probably<br>can't see it at the back they can you<br>see that - can you see the 20/20 line<br>can you see the 2012 line so if you're<br>if you're a mouse you have 2200 vision<br>which means pretty much of you go to the<br>doctors and they chest your eyes this is<br>top of the chart there so if you're a<br>blind mice' you're really blind okay<br>because that's a normal mice can see 22<br>but what they showed us that if they<br>showed these blind mice so they had zero<br>ability to see anything at all<br>if they presented them with blue light<br>they still knew if it was daytime or<br>nighttime they knew if it was time to be<br>up and around feeding or if was it's<br>time to be sleeping so even though they<br>couldn't see the light that they<br>physically had damaged eyes that they<br>couldn't see anything they still knew<br>what time of day it was<br>if you presented them them with this<br>blue light so that's a non-image forming<br>it's nothing to do with sight but it is<br>giving them information about what time<br>of datas and where we are in in our<br>biological rhythm and humans have<br>so actually France Nightingale was one<br>of the first people to recognize this<br>and way back in 1959 she published a<br>book called notes on nursing and in that<br>book she said that sunlight is directly<br>entering the hospital room was<br>absolutely necessary for patients to<br>recover so so she knew this a long time<br>ago she through her observations and the<br>way that she worked I looked her up on<br>Wikipedia and he lists her as a<br>statistician and she was an amazing<br>woman but more recent research we've<br>actually seen that people that have gone<br>in for coronary surgery the amount of<br>time they stay in hospital after their<br>surgery is actually related to how much<br>there's also research out of Asarco<br>University in Japan's very similar thing<br>people that have gone in for surgery to<br>have cancerous cells removed from their<br>esophagus two days earlier they are up<br>and about and ready to go if their<br>hospital room faces has a big window but<br>as able to see some natural sunlight<br>versus those people that don't there's<br>another study for the thing they had<br>and they basically showed that in<br>hospital if people had a room that was<br>looking out had a nice sunny day not<br>quite like today maybe a little sunnier<br>than today<br>they used 22% less pain medication so<br>obviously that's great for the patient<br>to be experiencing less pain it's also<br>actually pretty good for the hospital<br>they pay for less pain drugs for that<br>for the patients so so we see that this<br>exposure to natural light and<br>specifically this wavelength of light<br>the blue light is actually really<br>important for how we can recover it and<br>it actually has a lot of difference to<br>our physiological processes associated<br>with that but there's also some<br>interesting research around cognition<br>and and there's an interesting study<br>done in a lecture hall not too<br>dissimilar from this but it didn't have<br>any natural light and what they did was<br>they they put up a test on the on the<br>screen and basically all you had to do<br>was read across the the we a number of<br>letters on the screen and you just had<br>to read across and see how far you got<br>you know one want to give it a go tough<br>I'm going to do it anyway<br>does everyone really for that so this is<br>going to be some leaders come across<br>just underneath whoever that is on the<br>so how do we go you won't get to the end<br>you know I get to V V for victory<br>good good we're not a lot of you though<br>a so what I like to tell people as if<br>I'm not sounding very smart up there<br>that's because I don't have enough an<br>office with a window so that was in a<br>lecture hall and basically they exposed<br>people to blue light so they just had<br>blue blue light bulbs in the roof they<br>expose them for 20 seconds they just<br>turned it on for 20 seconds and they<br>showed that using that test which is a<br>pretty good test of fluid intelligence<br>or your ability to take in information<br>that 20 seconds of blue light and proved<br>people's IQ their their fluid<br>intelligence or their IQ by<br>approximately 5 IQ points 20 seconds of<br>exposure to blue light so we should be<br>using this in classrooms right people<br>should have classrooms that have natural<br>light it makes a lot of sense right so<br>there's been a few people that have<br>studied this that there is a study in<br>trends and neuroscience in education<br>showing that classrooms that do have<br>access to natural lighting that the kids<br>do do a lot better in terms of their<br>cognitive processing speed they do do a<br>lot better in terms of the ability to<br>focus and concentrate there's a study<br>from Holland that I won't try to<br>pronounce because Erica are in Arco<br>they're my neighbors will will tell me<br>that I've pronounced it wrong great to<br>see you though they had 89 students come<br>in 89 students come in and again they<br>showed this positive effect of natural<br>lighting or on the scholastic ability of<br>the students and probably the the most<br>compelling story was the the some work<br>that came out of America 8,000 students<br>they were from all across America some<br>places that get it quite a lot of<br>natural daylight other places not so<br>much they found this<br>in between the prison's of daylight and<br>student performance and they actually<br>went on to say the things we're<br>measuring the the concentration this<br>ability to focus our ability to think<br>they probably should be translated<br>across into the workplace so this is<br>actually a picture of one of my<br>workmates Dave we say so he's missed his<br>ten o'clock coffee and it really has not<br>turned out well for him there was one<br>study that came out from northern<br>Scotland so northern Scotland a little<br>bit like where we were and Ostersund<br>doesn't get a lot of natural light at<br>certain times of the year they had about<br>a hundred plus workers and that<br>basically they had two stories that was<br>a call center so two floors and they've<br>been one of the floors they installed<br>lights that were more like natural<br>sunlight the other floor not so much and<br>what they did they they had them all in<br>one floor for a while and they switched<br>them over so they could see the effects<br>of the natural sunlight on the<br>performance then it was a course<br>interest so they could they could<br>measure how many how many phone calls<br>did they answer how how are they doing<br>and actually maybe not surprising to you<br>after seeing some of this information<br>they actually did answer more phone<br>calls but also it improved a lot of<br>their other metrics they were measuring<br>it improved how well they perceived that<br>they slipped and improved their eye<br>discomfort so they didn't get the the<br>sore eyes after sitting in front of the<br>computers all day and improve their<br>irritability which would be great for my<br>workmate Dave because he's gets<br>irritable at work and it also improved<br>their mood and their sense of well-being<br>which is obviously really important<br>there's another study a little bit later<br>on a nation again showed that being<br>having an office with Windows versus the<br>people on the other side of the building<br>that didn't have the windows basically<br>having that that office worth being able<br>to see out and see that see the natural<br>light there lowered the level of stress<br>the people without a window had higher<br>stress levels they measured the cortisol<br>in the blood and they also<br>the amount of melatonin lit so melatonin<br>sort of that hormone that tells us to go<br>to sleep so during the day a melatonin<br>is really low but when the sun goes down<br>and melatonin starts going up and we get<br>sleepy yeah so what they did that they<br>measured this stress hormone and<br>melatonin and showed that they were<br>actually quite different between the<br>groups that were in the office with a<br>window and the office without and<br>actually that was related to how well<br>they slept but also some depressive<br>symptoms so during my time in Sweden I<br>was actually fortunate to work with some<br>pretty good athletes a biathlon athletes<br>they they ski and then they shoot are we<br>pretty familiar with biathlon yeah so<br>what we did we just were interested to<br>see do they shoot better because we're<br>talking about improved cognitive ability<br>and proved alertness are they actually<br>able to shoot better or perform better<br>when it's a nice sunny day versus some<br>of the competitions they hold at night<br>so in actually what we found as they<br>missed an extra one and a half shots<br>when the competition was at night now we<br>obviously we win and ask them you guys<br>can see the target right like there's a<br>big lights and everything that they<br>could actually see the target yep and<br>one and a half shots may not sound like<br>a lot but in biathlon you have this<br>penalty loop so every time you miss a<br>shot you have to do an extra 200 meters<br>so if you miss a shot and the guy next<br>you doesn't then good luck catching him<br>again yeah and we did an another study<br>while in Sweden I worked with a student<br>from psychology as doing his master's<br>there and we looked at decision-making<br>and reaction times comparing caffeine<br>with blue light and what we actually<br>found was that caffeine did help you<br>with<br>your your reaction time but it also made<br>you make a few more mistakes when you<br>were trying to choose between trying to<br>make a decision<br>whereas blue light improved your<br>reaction time but you also were less<br>likely to make these sort of accuracy<br>errors unfortunately I couldn't really<br>think of any sports where having a fast<br>reaction time in making good decisions<br>was good I mean I was useful so we sort<br>of shelf that research one thing we did<br>find from that study was it seemed as<br>though the effect was larger in people<br>with blue eyes so it may be that we know<br>a lot of Scandinavian people and people<br>from that sort of area do tend to have<br>blue eyes it may be that that helps them<br>during those periods where there isn't a<br>lot of natural sunlight around that they<br>are a little bit more sensitive to the<br>effects of light and a little bit of<br>potentially supporting information for<br>that as and these reindeers and they<br>hang out in the Arctic Circle and this<br>is just for you Erika their reindeer<br>portion and actually their eyes change<br>color and winter their eyes are blue and<br>some of their eyes are red so this is a<br>deer that I've found with the blue eyes<br>there and they say again that that's<br>probably an evolutionary process so that<br>they're able to be more sensitive to the<br>really low levels of light that are<br>around during the winter periods in the<br>Arctic Circle so we have sort of talked<br>about a little bit about the mood in the<br>workplace and the effects of having that<br>more natural light in the moon and more<br>natural light helping us with our mood<br>and we all sort of know on a sunny day<br>people are generally a little bit<br>happier so the student I was working<br>with in in Sweden he actually measured<br>that the effect on mood of this blue<br>light intervention we gave them which<br>was just sitting under a blue light for<br>about an hour and and we did show really<br>positive effects on on mood through blue<br>light it's pretty well known that I'd<br>say the seasonal affective<br>during the winter in the Scandinavian<br>countries is quite a big issue<br>you do see quite high levels of this<br>depressive type disorder during the<br>winter it can be up to 10% of the<br>population suffers from seasonal<br>affective disorder in America there's<br>actually stats showing that seasonal<br>affective disorder probably affects<br>around 1% of people in Florida but about<br>10% of people in Alaska so depending on<br>where you are and the length of their<br>days in the night it can make quite a<br>big difference and we actually it's<br>pretty well known that light is an<br>effective intervention to try and assess<br>the road to treat some of these of<br>affective disorders<br>so if mental health week coming up maybe<br>it's a good idea to for everyone to get<br>outside and save a little bit of Sun and<br>that maybe that's why a daylight savings<br>is timed just right for that I will come<br>back to that a little bit later so I've<br>been standing up here saying that blue<br>light is great this natural light is<br>great what gives I thought it was<br>supposed to be hey the stuffs all bad<br>modern technology terrible yeah I think<br>Maddie's missed the point a little bit<br>with all of that the trouble is when<br>this blue light of the exposure to blue<br>light is at inappropriate times so we we<br>really should be seeing a lot of natural<br>light during the day actually on a<br>bright sunny day you'll get about<br>100,000 Lux of energy from the Sun of<br>light exposure from the Sun you're the<br>equivalent in a sitting in an office<br>with sort of the LED lights they're<br>probably about 300 or 400 Lux so it's a<br>couple of orders of magnitude different<br>to the amount of light exposure that our<br>parents experienced in humans have been<br>experiencing for thousands of years it's<br>a very different level of exposure in<br>the trouble is when people like this are<br>then going away at nighttime and being<br>having these high levels of exposure to<br>blue light and a lot of the LED screens<br>that obviously we hold them quite close<br>to our face<br>I'm glad my wife isn't here because she<br>would say that I do this far too often<br>so I should practice what I preach a<br>little bit more but the effect of that<br>is to instead of having this really big<br>difference between day and night we<br>should have a large exposure that's<br>100,000 versus basically zero at night<br>time now we're sort of getting three or<br>four hundred during the day over the<br>majority of our working day and then we<br>go home and when the Sun Goes Down we<br>just flick on the big big screen LED TV<br>we jump in front of a computer we have<br>our cell phones in front of us or a lot<br>of people these days do so that instead<br>of having this big swing between night<br>and day we were only really flattening<br>it out it gets a little bit confusing<br>for our body and it's not really sure<br>whether it's daytime or nighttime<br>anymore and one of the problems with<br>extending the day out like that and<br>having this long day so when we're<br>exposed to this artificial light well<br>into the evening we're telling our<br>bodies it's a really long day and<br>actually historically that would mean<br>it's summertime this is a this is a<br>great time to be out and about this is a<br>time when food is plentiful so what our<br>bodies and what our physiology is built<br>to do is to say hey I'm going to make<br>sure I take advantage of this time now<br>when things are plentiful and bountiful<br>because I know that winter is coming so<br>I'm going to need to store store up some<br>of this energy because I know that when<br>winter comes on there's not going to be<br>so much around the trouble is unlike for<br>there's some really interesting<br>information from out of people that live<br>close to the equator in there actually<br>the way they've the way their bodies<br>work is a little bit different to people<br>that have evolved away from the equator<br>because they're really used to a 12-hour<br>day in a 12 hour night and it really<br>doesn't change very much depending on<br>whether it's summer or winter but when<br>those people move away from the equator<br>so someone say maybe Polynesian descent<br>moves<br>to New Zealand they're not really able<br>to cope as well with these big swings in<br>and in the seasons so that could<br>potentially be if some of the underlying<br>reason why there are some of these non<br>convening communicable diseases that<br>things like diabetes have this sort of<br>higher prevalence and that sort of<br>population I guess we all sort of know<br>we all sort of know that America leads<br>the way in the obesity stats right but<br>there's a study in The Lancet which is a<br>really well-regarded scientific journal<br>they studied about 20,000 people they<br>studied them across 33 years so from<br>1980 to 9 2013 they tracked obesity<br>levels in the population and the sad<br>story is that they said there are no<br>national success stories in terms of<br>countries that are doing a good job of<br>dealing with the burgeoning waist lines<br>of their population like say USA it's<br>doing a pretty good job of being number<br>one I know they like to be number one a<br>lot of things probably not very enviable<br>this one but New Zealand if we look at<br>boys under 20 if we combine the groups<br>that were over both overweight and obese<br>20 twenty nine point six percent of boys<br>under 20 classified as being in with<br>either overweight or obese and I know<br>some of these statistics and KP is going<br>to hit me up it straight away and say<br>that's not that be all and end all<br>measure of health and I absolutely agree<br>with that but the the reality is that<br>the trend is moving in not ideal<br>situation if we look at obesity USA<br>number one and always under 20 adult<br>males overweight and obese who do we<br>who thinks USA who thinks someone a<br>little closer to home so 71.4% of adult<br>males in New Zealand considered<br>overweight or obese number one in the<br>world New Zealand girls under 20 we're<br>second in the world admittedly behind us<br>a good work USA and and adult women<br>we're with six but actually most of the<br>the countries that beat us in in terms<br>of the adult woman levels of obesity and<br>overweight they actually place a really<br>high value on being having body myths<br>that's part of the opulence that shows<br>that they have wealth yeah no questions<br>from you so do we know who this is<br>yep so Ellen elder has almost nothing to<br>do<br>my talk it's just met mesh was a great<br>show and don't get me wrong but one<br>thing that's been suggested is<br>contributing to the burgeoning waste<br>lines of the planet has been artificial<br>light at night so a la in artificial<br>can I go yeah that's going to just dry<br>so there was an article that came out in<br>2014 and the NL's of Medicine saying<br>that they really believe that artificial<br>lighting may be one of the key<br>contributors to the association between<br>global urbanization and the obesity<br>increases and levels of obesity that are<br>going on it was a really interesting<br>study that came out twenty fourteen<br>hundred and thirteen thousand<br>participants so that's a lot of<br>participants I'm normally lucky if I can<br>get ten they these were women from the<br>UK they were involved in a breakthrough<br>generation study they're all over<br>sixteen I think the average age was just<br>under fifty and what they did was they<br>collected a bunch of data on these these<br>ladies over a number of years and one of<br>the questions they were interested in as<br>the effect of artificial light at night<br>on on the prevalence of obesity and<br>overweight and one of the questions they<br>asked to try and get a finger on that<br>was a few are lying in bed at night<br>after you've turned out all the lights<br>if you put your hand out if you can see<br>your hand then you're in a certain group<br>that's probably got quite a high level<br>of light pollution and actually that was<br>one of the key distinguishing features<br>between people that were overweight<br>versus not overweight if you could see<br>your hand chances are you were<br>overweight in that study of one hundred<br>and thirteen thousand individuals so<br>they went away and recheck their numbers<br>they said they took into account hey do<br>these people smoke do these people do<br>heaps of<br>exercise and even after that accounted<br>for those types of lifestyle<br>interventions the people that could see<br>their hand was still more likely<br>statistically to be overweight because<br>another study performed pretty similar<br>study and it wasn't just BMI it was<br>waist-hip ratio and the measures that<br>are maybe a better and a indicator of<br>metabolic health but there was actually<br>a similar study done in Japan 500<br>participants again that's quite a lot of<br>people in my world in and if Ellen alder<br>was hanging out there they actually had<br>higher levels of triglyceride they had a<br>higher the the bad cholesterol and the<br>blood that the low-density lipoproteins<br>were actually much higher and that was<br>related to all cause mortality so if if<br>you could see your hand in bed or there<br>was a significant amount of light when<br>you're sleeping that was bad<br>and that was an elderly people so<br>they're all over 60 years old so if<br>that's not enough reason for you to<br>maybe switch off the digital alarm clock<br>in your room then actually there's<br>actually another study that's shown that<br>flashing a blue light for two<br>milliseconds so that gives you some<br>contexts and yet the most people when<br>they blink that's about a hundred and<br>fifty milliseconds so two milliseconds<br>flash of blue light while you're asleep<br>your eyes are closed is enough if you do<br>that two milliseconds every thirty<br>seconds for one hour so that's a total<br>dose of about less than quarter of a<br>second I'm going to say 240 milliseconds<br>that's enough to change your sleep<br>patterns it's enough to change your bio<br>rhythm it's enough to change your<br>temperature change while you're asleep<br>so there's some more interesting<br>information about Ellen elder here and<br>you can see them from space<br>apparently this is a study that looked<br>at the the light pollution across 80<br>countries so they just got satellite<br>images of the amount of light pollution<br>across these different countries and<br>they could basically predict which<br>countries would have a higher prevalence<br>of overweight and obese people based on<br>how much light was being detected from<br>space if they included a couple of other<br>variables like gross domestic product<br>the amount of the percentage of calories<br>that were consumed from roots and tubers<br>so if that was high the risk was lower<br>in terms of body weight they could they<br>said they could predict with about 70<br>percent accuracy the prevalence of<br>so what's Ellen doing<br>why doesn't radar just come in and say<br>hey Ellen cut it out so what Ellen does<br>is really affects our sleep I can see<br>that can influence some of those<br>biorhythms even through our closed<br>eyelids I think we all can appreciate if<br>we if we close our eyes and look up at<br>the light it's not completely dark right<br>you know if you look at the lights and<br>then put your hands over your eyes it's<br>going to be darker yep so even while<br>we're asleep this this Ellen elder can<br>sneak in and do some pretty nasty stuff<br>what we do know is that this artificial<br>light at night can influence our level<br>of slow-wave sleep that's our deep sleep<br>that's a really restorative recuperative<br>sleep that we need and that actually<br>plays a really vital role in memory<br>consolidation it plays a lot a role and<br>some of the the brain chemistry that<br>goes on in it's a really important time<br>for us to be able to our brain actually<br>flushes out a lot of the matter<br>lights during this sort of period of<br>sleep so this artificial light can sneak<br>in and do some really disrupt that type<br>of restorative sleep there's a study<br>from out of Harvard University and they<br>basically looked at a bunch of studies<br>across the planet and they found that<br>studies from all five continents and<br>said that in all the works they studied<br>there was a positive association between<br>this sleep being disrupted or short<br>sleep duration and whether there was and<br>higher levels of body weight being high<br>yeah the same study went on to say that<br>unfortunately this effect seemed to be<br>amplified in children so children were<br>especially vulnerable just because their<br>physiology is changing so rapidly and<br>and I guess we all appreciate at some<br>level that young children need a lot<br>more sleep then as we grow up and become<br>adults although my son at home doesn't<br>seem to follow that particularly well<br>there was one study that was done and<br>basically they looked at the factors<br>that were contributed to five-year-olds<br>and how whether their chances of being<br>obese when they were aged 5 and actually<br>the the body weight of the parents work<br>was significantly related to that<br>actually your chances of being heavy<br>when you're aged 5 with three times<br>greater if your parents were overweight<br>but in terms of environmental factors so<br>if your parents are overweight three<br>times more likely to be overweight if<br>you watched excessive television that<br>increased your odds again by about one<br>point two times the greatest predictor<br>of whether that child at five year old<br>was going to be overweight was not<br>snacks was not watching TV it was how<br>long they slept for you were 4.9 times<br>more likely to be overweight as a<br>five-year-old if your sleep was very<br>short<br>and unfortunately Ellen elder doesn't<br>stop there he's still going so what<br>happens when we have a short sleep as<br>well is that some of the hormones that<br>tell us when we're hungry and when we're<br>full get a little bit mixed up as well<br>and what you'll find is that people that<br>haven't had good sleeper have Headley at<br>this slow-wave sleep disrupted tend to<br>make poorer food choices though there's<br>a couple of studies in particular but<br>but one study was a sleep debt study and<br>they basically showed that people that<br>had a poor sleep or had a sleep deficit<br>with they're much more likely to take in<br>things with a really high carbohydrate<br>load for pretty nutrient not very<br>nutrient-dense although those donuts do<br>another aspect that hasn't talked about<br>so much with it with our modern society<br>so we've seen that it can affect our<br>sleep which is obviously quite poor in<br>it but it also because we're awake at<br>nighttime who are awake for longer<br>periods the time that we actually eat<br>has changed quite a lot from say 30 40<br>50 years ago<br>so the simin from really interesting<br>mice and basically like I said earlier<br>these mice are nocturnal so they're<br>active time as the night time so if you<br>feed them and they have exercised during<br>the night time that find no happy mice<br>probably sing songs about Mickey Mouse<br>and all sorts of things but if you give<br>those mice exactly the same amount of<br>food give them exactly the same amount<br>of exercise but they get that food and<br>exercise during the daytime so that's<br>the time that's supposed to be sleeping<br>they get quite sick and they get quite<br>fat so how does that translate to what<br>we're doing currently with ourselves<br>you'd say well you know that that's mice<br>that doesn't yeah it's not really humans<br>there's another really interesting study<br>in rats I've shown it almost exactly the<br>same thing that they basically tried to<br>mimic shiftwork and rats and showed very<br>very similar results if the work is done<br>at the wrong time and the feeding is at<br>the wrong time that has negative<br>consequences in terms of their metabolic<br>health how they deal with food and also<br>their body weight hasn't been a study<br>done in chickens yet but if someone<br>wants to give me some money or you can<br>go and do study in chickens but but<br>there is a study and human so it's<br>probably more relevant to us today and<br>basically what they showed was that a<br>few ate more than 33% of your entire<br>daily calories so 33% was your at<br>dinnertime or all and later you're that<br>much more likely to be overweight<br>actually about two times more likely to<br>be overweight so maybe there is<br>something in that the old wives tale<br>about breakfast like a king yeah lunch<br>so this poor shark his cancer he's not<br>going to be terrifying any young kids at<br>the beach anytime soon unfortunately so<br>the there is actually unfortunately<br>links between this artificial light at<br>night and cancer prevalence there's a<br>lot of statistics around people that<br>work shift work this studies done in<br>nurses in particular showing that the<br>levels of breast cancer are much higher<br>and people that have this that the their<br>body the external cues that they're<br>getting from the environment and their<br>internal cues are out of out of whack<br>there's a really recent study out of<br>Spain they collected data across five<br>years I think they had four thousand<br>people in the study prostate and breast<br>cancer were basically reduced by 20% if<br>there was a long time between when you<br>had dinner and when you enter bed so if<br>there was at least two hours between<br>when you had your dinner and when you<br>went to bed your chance of getting<br>prostate cancer or breast cancer<br>depending on whether you're a male or<br>female was 20% reduced so really it<br>really shows the importance of matching<br>up Aaron to nor biorhythm with what's<br>going on in the environment around us<br>and that's something that our modern<br>lifestyle and a lot of our interaction<br>with modern devices is actually having a<br>pretty negative impact it was a really<br>interesting study where they took they<br>took blood from woman and they either<br>took them during the day so a nice sunny<br>day that's when our melatonin levels are<br>really low because the Sun is<br>suppressing her melatonin they took it<br>in during the night time so the<br>melatonin levels were really high and<br>what they and then I also took from the<br>nighttime but and those women that were<br>exposed to artificial light at night so<br>what they did with that blood they took<br>it away and then they actually<br>cultivated it with cancer cells so if<br>you put the<br>very melatonin depleted blood from<br>during the day and with a cancer cell it<br>actually grew it proliferated it was<br>fairly happy and that mellow melatonin<br>blood but if you gave it the blood from<br>the night time so melatonin was really<br>high in those samples that actually<br>suppress and actually started killing<br>the cancer self the cancer cell couldn't<br>survive in that high melatonin blood<br>what do we think happened<br>with the blood with the woman that were<br>taken at nighttime but there was<br>artificial light at night around who<br>think the cancer cells were happy with<br>that<br>yeah so the cancer cells still grew it<br>so if you're exposing yourself to this<br>artificial light at night then your<br>melatonin levels are going to be<br>suppressed and that that's actually one<br>of our key defenses melatonin is one of<br>our key defenses against the radical<br>damage and in cancer spreading is<br>actually a really interesting book I<br>read by dr. John alt and he went to the<br>Congo and sort of just lived with the<br>natives for a while and a lot of the<br>natives didn't actually wear very much<br>but when the Westerners arrived they<br>were they they didn't really adopt too<br>many of their Western ways but they<br>loved the sunglasses<br>those things are stylee but most people<br>couldn't actually afford the sunglasses<br>so it was only really the rich people<br>that got sunglasses so that be walking<br>around with their sunglasses and not<br>much else<br>and that'd be rocking out there be super<br>super happy and what they did they found<br>that the level of cancers that were<br>experienced by this tribe that was you<br>know quite remote in the Congo actually<br>started to increase but only in the rich<br>people<br>so that being exposed without blocking<br>out some of the natural sunlight and<br>some of these these wavelengths of light<br>that are actually quite important for us<br>to signal what time of datas but also to<br>signal our body to function correctly I<br>did mention about shift work and<br>actually there's been a paper coming out<br>by the Royal Society saying that shift<br>workers as is actually now classified as<br>a class to a carcinogen so there's five<br>categories of Kastner gennadiy one is<br>this is going to give you cancer and<br>that same paper from from the Royal<br>Society also said that excessive<br>lighting of the night sky is an<br>important and earth issue as climate<br>change<br>that's how serious they think it is and<br>unfortunately we're not the only people<br>that live on this planet there's lots of<br>other insects and plant life around and<br>there's an interesting study from 2016<br>some Swiss researchers gathered a<br>thousand larvae from moths and basically<br>showed that so they grabbed half of them<br>from out on the farm so these were moths<br>that were used to you know it being dark<br>at nighttime and the other half they<br>grabbed from in the city with obviously<br>a lot of street lights and a little bit<br>of light pollution around and what they<br>did when these moths hatched they put<br>them in a big room and they had light at<br>one end and what they found was that the<br>moths that had that had taken from the<br>city where there was a lot of light<br>pollution we all know moths you know<br>moth to a flame they go towards the<br>light these moths didn't really because<br>that figured out it was actually an<br>evolutionary advantage that if they went<br>to the light that's where all the<br>Predators hung out because the Predators<br>knew that's where the moths go so if you<br>went to the light you got eaten so these<br>moths had already evolved in quite a<br>short period of time to not go towards<br>the light which is great if you're a<br>moth and you don't want to get eaten but<br>it's not so great because essentially<br>moths are like the bees of the night<br>they go around and they pollinate the<br>flowers they pollinate all the food<br>crops so if they don't travel around as<br>much because they're not going towards<br>the light that then they don't pollinate<br>as much and that's a not ideal in terms<br>of the ecosystem as a whole so what<br>there's a few maybe takeaways or some<br>ideas that we can think of here and I<br>think mainly what I want you to take<br>away from today is to just be aware of<br>where biorhythm how some of these things<br>can have an effect on our body<br>I must be getting close to time which is<br>good because the next slide is a summary<br>slide try and keep it dark at nighttime<br>when when you are trying to get to sleep<br>and dark is good even a little bit of<br>light can be quite detrimental to your<br>sleep in to your health<br>try to get outside during the day hey we<br>live in the Bay of Plenty why not get<br>outside and enjoy some of the sunshine<br>yeah try and not watch as much Game of<br>Thrones as I do at nighttime try and<br>trying to limit the TV use and in cell<br>phone use and into the night and even<br>try maybe it's obviously easier at this<br>time of year now that daylight savings<br>is kicked in but try to eat when the<br>Sun's up yeah there's a great study that<br>came from they got a bunch of people who<br>they're biorhythms were actually quite<br>out of work they were living in City and<br>all they did was they went camping for a<br>week and within that one week a lot of<br>the issues that they were having in<br>terms of their biorhythms were sorted<br>out they've realigned themselves with<br>the Sun coming up and the Sun going down<br>so here's the summary blue lights an<br>important signal it's fine at<br>appropriate times it's great to get out<br>and see the Sun but try and avoid it at<br>night times because it can have health<br>implications healthy living and involves<br>getting outside it's not just what we<br>eat and it's not just the exercise we're<br>doing there there are a lot of other<br>things that are involved in being<br>healthy and I think when we eat it's not<br>just what we eat and again I'm not a<br>medical doctor so please don't attack me<br>too much but when we eat there's enough<br>information out there now to say that<br>that can actually have a pretty big<br>effect on the outcomes and sleep in the<br>so I'm just going to touch our little<br>cup of people take some photos over here<br>Mental Health Awareness Week next week<br>mental health foundation runs a great<br>site please support them if you can<br>ww dr. preston org we've probably seen<br>their ads on TV with John Kirwan it's a<br>really serious condition if you know<br>anyone or having any sort of symptoms<br>yourself where you're not enjoying<br>things as much as you used to<br>there's a toll-free number there and you<br>can text free trained counselors<br>Marty thank you so much I have an 18<br>year old daughter who's going to be<br>spoken to this evening convinced her<br>that YouTube is not her best friend at<br>night<br>ladies and gentleman if you have any<br>questions we are filming so I need to<br>bring the mic to you could you raise<br>your hand for Maddy okay a lot of us are<br>going over to LED lighting we get warm<br>white and cold white is the cold white<br>blue light is that healthy for you at<br>the right time of day it's better for<br>you to be exposed to that type of light<br>and a lot of their experimenting now<br>with smart lighting systems where<br>actually that light will change to a<br>warmer color as as the Sun Goes Down so<br>I actually have on my computer you can<br>download a program that's called f.lux<br>and you can tell when the sun goes down<br>because my screen changes from being<br>quite bright and it starts getting a<br>warmer sort of red color so those types<br>of light are important not not as<br>beneficial I would say as getting<br>outside in the sunlight but they will be<br>helpful if you are confined indoors or a<br>few having to work like some of us then<br>that side what sort of riding is better<br>than the standard yeah raise your hand<br>thank you two questions please<br>is there any correlation between those<br>cultures that eat late at night like<br>Spain and obesity and the second<br>question is our Kindles inherently bad<br>for you compared to books so yeah that<br>study was actually done in Spain that I<br>mentioned and what they call the two<br>hours after dinner was actually pretty<br>late for like they're talking about<br>going to be at it you know or the dinner<br>time being prior to 9 9 p.m. that level<br>of association only became evident when<br>they ate later than 9 p.m. and I'm more<br>than happy to give you the reference<br>details as well there if you want to<br>actually have a look it's actually a<br>really interesting rate just came out<br>this year and Kindles versus books short<br>any other questions we've got a couple<br>of little kids and we went out of a way<br>to find a red nightlight<br>now that's you're making us reconsider<br>that have you got any comments about<br>sort of Night Lights for kids so rids<br>probably the least harmful light in<br>terms of the signal to our brain as<br>actually a quite small wavelength in it<br>as what we perceive as being blue<br>so rids of see sort of the other end of<br>the spectrum to that so that's I would<br>say is a a better option Night Lights in<br>general I would say I would avoid yeah<br>my optician tells me that I should wear<br>dark glasses during the day because<br>otherwise I'm going to be affected and<br>I'm going to lose some of my so you're<br>telling me that I shouldn't wear dark<br>glasses because and and I know that<br>you're not a health doctor but you're<br>still telling me that soon I'm just<br>wondering if you've got a comment on<br>there it's a really good question and<br>I'm glad someone asked it just to make<br>me squirm that's but but actually<br>sunglasses are a reasonably new<br>invention a lot of people wear them for<br>fashion as opposed to necessarily some<br>sort of medical reason if you have dry<br>eyes then it's important to look after<br>your your eye health if you're out in<br>the Sun all day and there's a lot of<br>clear then yes it's important to<br>minimize some of that so if you're going<br>skiing or if you're out at the beach but<br>the the very pervasive wearing of<br>sunglasses is probably not as necessary<br>as maybe some health professionals would<br>have you believe I actually find it<br>interesting I haven't stopped wearing<br>sunglasses completely but I've stopped a<br>lot and I I noticed when I go outside<br>with a lot of my friends they that's<br>squinting yeah that's struggling to be<br>outside with the bright sunlight without<br>some sort of covering on their eyes and<br>and that's not how humans have been for<br>as it beneficial to have a blue light<br>screen on on top of your phone if you're<br>gonna use it after a certain time all<br>that meta gate some of the risk almost<br>yet some some of those aren't super<br>effective and some of the level of light<br>with the new technology now the LED on<br>the new iPhone 10 I remember reading<br>some research thing that even with that<br>blue light blocker on the the iPhone<br>Tina that's worse than the iPhone I<br>think it was a seven but because that<br>the size of the screen is different and<br>the the intensity of the light as as<br>different but it is a step in the right<br>direction<br>final question final - killing me Joanna<br>hi I have my phone charging beside the<br>bed at night because I need it for the<br>alarm clock in the morning and it's got<br>the little circle was blue like that<br>pulsate its pulsates to show that it's<br>charging is that harmful what a pillow<br>over it or something if you can try and<br>hi there and my question is we've just<br>put in all new windows
