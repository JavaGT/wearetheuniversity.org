Jones<br>publications are outstanding professor<br>Jones research interests focus on<br>cardiovascular disease and he's been<br>described as the leading figure in<br>promoting multidisciplinary<br>international team science to answer<br>complex questions related to abdominal<br>aortic aneurysms and another referee<br>commented the<br>here's a pillar in the aneurism<br>community respected not only for his<br>science but his ability to bridge<br>personal differences and smooth egos he<br>is not only a leader in science but a<br>leader in the broad sense so I'm out to<br>embarrass you tonight great I also need<br>to add that while Greg is a research<br>professor he is also an active and<br>enthusiastic teacher from my previous<br>roles of head of anatomy and chair of<br>the health science first year<br>operational committee I can attest to<br>his many achievements as a teacher<br>secondly he's also been willing to take<br>on leadership roles in teaching<br>convening the cardiovascular module for<br>the medical program and more recently<br>convening hubs 1:9 - one of the very<br>large health science first-year papers<br>this is very unusual for a research<br>professor and I don't know of any other<br>research professor who convenes such a<br>large and important paper to the<br>University Greg has also contributed not<br>only to the university but to the wider<br>scientific community through his<br>involvement with the Otago Medical<br>Research Foundation and with Anne Scott<br>the Australian and New Zealand Council<br>for the care of animals in research and<br>teaching I'd like to now invite<br>professor Brunton to talk in more detail<br>about Greg's achievements but before I<br>do I'd like to finish with a quote from<br>one of his referees which I think sums<br>up Greg as a person Greg is perceived as<br>a very intelligent person but at the<br>same time he is humble he is the really<br>nice guy you want to have a drink with<br>and talk about anything<br>Kirra<br>tena tato counter my name is Professor<br>Paul Brunton I'm the pro vice chancellor<br>for Health Sciences and I'd like to have<br>my welcome to that of Professor<br>Nicholson's to this this event this<br>evening my role is to summarize Greg's<br>career to date and tell you a little bit<br>about his lecture and he has had an<br>amazing career so to try and sum that up<br>in a few minutes is no mean feat but I<br>will do my best<br>so Greg obtained his Bachelor of Science<br>for the double major in anatomy and<br>physiology from the University of Otago<br>in 1989 following on with a PhD and<br>again in anatomy in surgery<br>from the University of Otago in 1997<br>post's followed then at the Mulligan<br>Medical Research Institute in Wellington<br>back here at the Dunedin School of<br>Medicine and then on to the physiology<br>department at the University of<br>Melbourne in 1999 he joined the staff<br>here at the University as a lecturer in<br>January of 2000 as Helen ders mentioned<br>was promoted to be a senior lecturer in<br>2006 a research associate professor in<br>2010 and then on to be a research<br>professor from 2018 as we know he has<br>had as I'm sure we'll all agree a very<br>successful academic career with multiple<br>publications grants and many<br>distinctions too numerous to mention<br>this evening so without further ado I'd<br>like to call on Greg to present his<br>lecture which is entitled that picture<br>tells a thousand words a visual journey<br>in cardiovascular disease research<br>thank you<br>cure everyone first of all thank you<br>very much for all of you that have come<br>along tonight and share this night so<br>it's very special night for me I guess<br>it's a once-in-a-career type of event<br>and and I hope I can show you some of<br>why it's not a hassle for me to get up<br>in the morning and come to work I love<br>my job I would do it as a hobby if they<br>didn't pay me but shouldn't say that in<br>front of management should I so I'm just<br>going to so I decided I would talk about<br>my journey through cardiovascular<br>research in a visual context because I<br>think I'm quite a visual learner and I<br>hope that through this lecture you'll<br>get an impression of that of why really<br>seeing is believing in many ways in my<br>has been a sort of a sort of a principal<br>throughout my research career now my<br>research began working with Bill Stevens<br>in the early 90s now bill was the<br>foundation professor of pathology at<br>Wellington School of Medicine and he<br>sadly passed away a number of years ago<br>now but this was what was written about<br>bill by Robert Olson for his work for a<br>eulogy that was written for him bill was<br>an amazing guy he was a real<br>intellectual very old-school<br>intellectual and I guess the the<br>Cambridge Oxford sort of model but what<br>made him stand out was that he<br>questioned the the existing dogma and<br>science and he took on something that<br>was really quite challenging at the time<br>he was a guy that said that actually<br>it's not just about lipid as the driver<br>of vascular disease that there's more to<br>it it's the way the blood flows through<br>blood vessels and he really took a lot<br>of flack for that it wasn't a popular<br>thing to say in the 1970's and 80's when<br>he started his work looking at the the<br>pathogenesis of atherosclerosis that's<br>the pathology that tends to block your<br>blood vessels but it was also a very<br>visual guy and as an anatomic<br>pathologist I remember when I first met<br>him pretty much the interview involved<br>him sticking<br>the picture very similar to this in<br>front of me and saying what do you see<br>and really put me on the spot and just<br>sat there and looked at me and said tell<br>me what you see<br>and so my reaction to that was well I'm<br>not quite sure but I'd hazard a guess<br>and I went on from there and I think it<br>was that I would hazard a guess that<br>probably won him over because he did<br>actually take me on to his group this is<br>actually a cell that's sitting in an<br>afro erotic plaque it's nucleus as this<br>bit up here this is the cell body here<br>and all this gray stuff around the<br>outside is the fact the cell doesn't<br>like being in this environment and it's<br>stacked up all this protein around it<br>after joining builds group in a<br>relatively short period of time I<br>managed to produce my first paper and it<br>made the cover of the journal which I<br>was really chuffed about it wasn't the<br>picture I would have chosen out of the<br>paper but it was on the cover anyway and<br>I remember it really hooked me I just I<br>got this idea publishing is pretty cool<br>especially when they put your picture on<br>the on the front of the journal so this<br>was a paper actually that derived from<br>work that wasn't the main reason I was<br>working with Bill and he actually was<br>really great in that he would actually<br>foster your curiosity and so he said<br>actually there's this really old<br>technique that these German pathologists<br>used and if you want to give it a go in<br>your spare time it might lead to<br>something and actually it led to about<br>five or six papers just that spin-off<br>technique it's called the house and<br>technique it's basically means a thin<br>skin and it involves removing the<br>endothelial lining of blood vessels and<br>looking at in isolation and I'll show<br>you some pictures of that in a moment<br>but when most people think about the<br>cardiovascular system they think about<br>the big stuff they think about the heart<br>the big arteries and the big veins and<br>these are big pumps and pipes with thick<br>walls and many pathologists and and<br>researchers tend to focus on the<br>structural components of the wall but an<br>actual fact often forgotten about is the<br>fact this whole network of pumps and<br>pipes is lined by a really thin layer of<br>cells that we call endothelial cells and<br>these provide the nonstick<br>surface of our entire cardiovascular<br>system if you didn't have these little<br>thin cells the blood would literally sit<br>in your blood vessels and you'd have<br>black pudding throughout your whole<br>cardiovascular system which wouldn't be<br>great so these cells look a bit like<br>this diagrammatic representation here<br>they're a bit like big garden pavers<br>that sit on the surface of your blood<br>vessels separating the blood from the<br>wall and they're really really important<br>and they look like this this is one of<br>these Houston preparations this is where<br>I've peeled the surface lining of<br>endothelial cells off the wall of a<br>blood vessel and laid it out on a<br>microscope slide so this is what the<br>cells looked like in the intact blood<br>vessel the nuclei are the dark smudgy<br>things and the black lines are I've used<br>silver to stain the edge of the cells<br>it's a really old technique and we<br>managed to get it to work and produce<br>these lovely preparations I think they<br>look kind of pretty and it's like a<br>cobblestoned arrangement that the blood<br>would see as it rushes through a blood<br>vessel traditionally we look at blood<br>vessels by slicing through them a<br>process called histology we take the<br>tissue and we slice it like on a ham<br>slicer but a really thin slice that we<br>can then lay on a glass slide put on a<br>microscope and look at the structure of<br>a blood vessel and so this is histology<br>of a of an artery wall the blood would<br>be up here at the top and this would be<br>the exterior the blood vessel here and<br>I've put it in black and white because<br>when I first started working this shows<br>my age everything was published in black<br>and white and if you wanted color if you<br>could get a journal to do it they would<br>charge you thousands for it so<br>everything was in black and white but<br>anyway this is what a normal healthy<br>blood vessel looks like now my<br>subsequent work working with people like<br>Andre van Wray and the surgical<br>community we get surgical biopsies from<br>patients that look like this this is the<br>in stage disease and what we've got to<br>try to do is work out how we got from<br>the healthy blood vessel to the diseased<br>blood vessel and what were the steps<br>along the way and all I want you to take<br>home from these two pictures as they<br>look really really different and working<br>out the steps in between is really<br>tricky and what Bill Stebbins had done<br>was hid developed some animal<br>bass models to develop to look at the<br>steps that intervene between the normal<br>healthy blood vessel and the extremely<br>diseased blood vessel and by doing that<br>you could have a step like this where<br>you can sort of see a transition now<br>from the healthy blood vessel and you<br>can see this sort of looks the same we<br>can still see this black line here which<br>is a layer of elastic protein like<br>rubber you can see it's nice and intact<br>here here it's become broken and some<br>the muscle and the wall of the artery<br>has flooded out and start to thicken<br>this layer out here and then you can go<br>to another stage here and the dark stuff<br>in the middle here is actually fat<br>cholesterol that's accumulating at the<br>boundary where those breaks have<br>occurred so by using these models we can<br>actually understand the sequential<br>process for the pathology of<br>atherosclerosis which is really<br>important what's important in this<br>histology<br>is that the endothelial cells are really<br>hard to see if we look at them this way<br>they are a really thin layer of cells<br>when you look at them sidon and so the<br>elastic tissue is the black line near<br>the endothelial cells are a little it's<br>really hard to even point out a little<br>gray line on the top here so most<br>histology and pathologists miss these<br>cells in histology because they're very<br>hard to see so what would be better<br>would be to use that house in<br>preparation where you look at the cells<br>on Fuss face on as the blood would see<br>it running through the tube and that's<br>what this preparation is here one of<br>these preparations where we have the<br>endothelial cells as a blood cell would<br>see it inside the tube looking at the<br>wall and I've peeled this off the wall<br>of the blood vessel and I'm going to<br>sort of do that animate that now lift it<br>off peel it away and put it to one side<br>and that's the endothelial cells to one<br>side but then I'm still left with the<br>rest of the wall which I can also look<br>at and that's what this other image is<br>over to the side here this is the<br>elastic tissue that those cells rest on<br>and you can see in this blood vessel<br>that elastic tissue kinda looks ripped<br>and torn I'll animate it the green stuff<br>is the intact elastic tissue this<br>rubbery layer and the lines in between<br>and where it's split and torn like<br>rubba and what I hope you can see is<br>that the endothelial cells sitting on<br>the top have changed depending whether<br>they're sitting on an tacked elastic<br>tissue or they're sitting in one of the<br>crypts of those tiers so if I put the<br>blue animation in near those cells are<br>sitting on the intact elastic tissue<br>they haven't really changed much but the<br>cells that have flooded into the gaps<br>where it's split and torn and it happens<br>very quickly have become this smaller<br>they've proliferated and I can tell that<br>because the nuclei of the darkest<br>staining and they're more tightly packed<br>into those gaps and this was this was a<br>I think quite a nice observation at the<br>time we were doing this work everyone<br>thought that the endothelium was a kind<br>of a sluggish cell and it got torn apart<br>when these breaks happened and they<br>would slow to go in there and fill in<br>the gaps and in the time it took to go<br>in there and fill in these spaces you<br>would have other cells coming out of the<br>blood and getting into the wall this is<br>one of these preparations at where a<br>blood vessel is branching so I've got<br>this diagram here it's obviously not a<br>blood vessel it's a piece of metal pipe<br>but I think it's quite nice to show you<br>this area here is the equivalent of that<br>preparation of cells that you're looking<br>at there and that weld line that I've<br>indicated with the black arrow is the<br>equivalent of that axis that I'm<br>indicating there so what we're seeing<br>are the cells as they hit one of these<br>points where the blood vessel divides<br>into two so this is blood vessel a off<br>the side and this is blood vessel B over<br>this side and the red line is that axis<br>or the flow divider that separates those<br>two branch vessels and what I hope you<br>can notice is that along that Ridge of<br>that flow divider the cells have an<br>interesting shape they're kind of almost<br>rounded whereas the cells running into<br>the blood vessels have an elongated<br>shape these cells reflect the flow of<br>the blood over the top of them if the<br>Bloods rushing along really quickly they<br>become elongated and long spindle shaped<br>if the Bloods kind of rolling around as<br>happens at the ridge of this flow<br>divider they can't really decide what<br>shape to have so they become sort of<br>rounded and the other thing you might<br>notice is these dark purple splotches<br>that are<br>Ridge as well these are white cells<br>blood cells that normally run around in<br>the circulation and for some reason<br>they've decided to stick at this point<br>to the endothelial cells and they're<br>going to try to get into the blood<br>vessel wall and we know that's an<br>important part of the process of this<br>disease atherosclerosis so this work was<br>quite neat because it's showing you that<br>there's some cells land this one's<br>landed right on top of the center thelia<br>cell this one's gone to the edge between<br>two cells and this one here it kind of<br>looks a bit sort of dumbbell shaped it's<br>actually in the process of squeezing<br>between these cells and when we did this<br>work it was really the first to show<br>these kind of associations so this is a<br>much higher magnification image showing<br>that process in more detail and what I<br>did which was a little bit different and<br>it took the old how some technique from<br>the 1950s as I combined it with<br>immunohistochemistry which is a way of<br>actually staining for specific proteins<br>so the brown you're seeing now are<br>actually adhesion molecules proteins<br>specific proteins which bind white cells<br>that come from the circulation and so<br>you can see this little white cell with<br>the asterisks here sitting here with<br>this dark staining around the edge here<br>and you need these adhesion molecules if<br>you don't have them the cell would sort<br>of hit the top and bounce off again and<br>the analogy I like to use and my kids<br>will know why I use this one this is an<br>f-14 Tomcat trying to land on the<br>aircraft carrier and these cells are<br>running through blood vessels and up to<br>two meters our second so tiny little<br>cell shooting along at two meters a<br>second they need some way to grip onto<br>the wall so they don't get washed off<br>again and they do that with these<br>adhesion molecules and this work showed<br>these adhesion molecules a bit like<br>velcro grabbing the cell it's a<br>interaction between the endothelial cell<br>and the white cell and the adhesion<br>molecules are acting like the catch wire<br>for this Tomcat trying to land on the<br>aircraft carrier gripping it down so it<br>can stick on to the surface of the<br>endothelial cell at then rolls to the<br>edge and tries to get into the under the<br>endothelial cell into the wall and this<br>emerges some work I did with Bill<br>showing exactly that and I'll color it<br>for you so it's<br>the white cell is the red cell the<br>endothelial cells are the blue cells and<br>you can see that the cell has rolled to<br>the edge between two endothelial cells<br>and is burrowing down to get into the<br>wall<br>so those adhesion molecules captured the<br>cell it rolls to the edge and then<br>burrows into the wall what does it do<br>when it gets there well it's going to<br>start to change the underlying character<br>of the wall and and thicken it up and<br>form the afterö strata Clark but what<br>this work showed and this is some work I<br>did when I came down to Otago with Andre<br>then Roy was to actually show that these<br>white cells aren't just arriving<br>randomly at these sites of injury that<br>actually the endothelial cell is saying<br>hey I'm the sort of insulin controller<br>here there's an accident happen in the<br>blood vessel wall you guys need to come<br>out of the blood and come in here and<br>fix the problem and you can see how<br>that's happening here there's a site of<br>injury the elastic tissue underneath<br>here is broken the cells of the n'they<br>Liam have flutter then and actually<br>repaired that pretty well there's only a<br>little bit here where the endothelial<br>cells haven't quite covered up the<br>defect yet it happens really quickly but<br>the thing to notice here the brown stain<br>is a protein that these endothelial<br>cells around the edge of this lesion<br>this defect has started to Express to<br>say hey you white cells need to come in<br>here there's a problem and you can see<br>the way the white cells have responded<br>previous to this sort of work people<br>thought they would land in the bit where<br>there's no endothelial cells where it<br>was denuded and it was this damaged the<br>idea you had to damage the endothelium<br>physically for the white cells to enter<br>the wall but this work shows quite<br>nicely that the endothelial cells<br>actually there is actually the mediator<br>here it's the one producing the factors<br>saying come in and these are the white<br>cells here these dark dots here here and<br>all over here and you can see quite<br>nicely that they're not landing in this<br>site of injury their site landing around<br>the outside of that site so it really is<br>a very endothelial cell mediated process<br>and this is pretty important because we<br>now understand that the endothelial cell<br>is a key cell in a thorough Scott ik and<br>formation so those white cells land on<br>the surface they burrow through the<br>endothelium and then they get underneath<br>the end<br>helium and this histology shows that<br>quite nicely here's the endothelium on<br>the top here a really thin layer here's<br>a break in that elastic tissue and you<br>can see the cells have gotten here and<br>formed what we call a foam cell lesion<br>at that site of injury and that is<br>dependent on the endothelium bringing<br>those cells in and this was a kind of at<br>the time it's a long time ago now but at<br>the time that was kind of a novel idea<br>and the important thing about this is it<br>just keeps happening so the cells keep<br>coming in and you can see here this<br>longitudinal section of a blood vessel<br>you can see the blood travels from one<br>end to the other and traveling through<br>this but it's really going to struggle<br>because that plaque that lesion that<br>disease process is narrowed the lumen<br>the pipe so it's harder for blood to get<br>through and if you look carefully you'll<br>see on this wall there's a break here<br>and here and here and here this is where<br>it would have all begun for this lesion<br>because of these breaks and then this<br>process of cells coming in out of the<br>circulation to thicken the wall at that<br>site and the important thing that that<br>this is bill Stevens's idea about<br>hemodynamics the way blood flows and<br>blood vessels is critical to where the<br>plaques form if we look at the opposite<br>wall that black line is perfectly intact<br>it hasn't broken the endothelium is<br>happy nothing gets into the wall and so<br>we can see the lesion on one wall quite<br>a catastrophic change to the to the<br>walls character the other wall<br>completely unaffected and that seems to<br>be related to the way the blood runs<br>into this vessel it's passing actually<br>onto this wall with a plaque as present<br>and this is kind of fundamental work and<br>and really quite important in our<br>understanding of the pathogenesis of<br>vascular disease so this diagram does<br>anyone know who the the artist is that<br>drew this the backwards writing so<br>giveaway yeah da Vinci exactly this is<br>Leonardo da Vinci's I'm not going to<br>compete with Leonardo of course but this<br>is I think quite a beautiful picture but<br>actually this is the reality of what he<br>was trying to draw now this is something<br>that I created well<br>the body created and I filled it full of<br>plastic this is a vascular corrosion<br>cast and this is again part of why I<br>love my job you get to do these sort of<br>semi creative things this is a heart<br>where I've injected plastic liquid<br>plastic into the major artery coming off<br>the left side of the heart the a water<br>pushed it back and filling up the<br>coronary arteries let that plastic see<br>it and then dissolved all the soft<br>tissue away and I think they're<br>beautiful I love them and the students<br>love them as well we use them a lot in<br>teaching you don't get justice from it<br>here in two dimensions you can hold them<br>up as a 3-dimensional cast and we rotate<br>them around in front of light boxes<br>really good for trying to learn how to<br>understand a coronary angiogram as<br>you're moving on into your medical<br>imaging they're just I think just<br>beautiful to look at and this is another<br>example here where I've colored the<br>different coronary arteries going to<br>different parts of the heart and I'll<br>let the reason go right into the small<br>capillaries around the heart muscle and<br>this third example here is actually a<br>person that had triple bypass s so these<br>things here are actually veins which<br>have been grafted on to the patient's a<br>water and down beyond those blocked<br>vessels to other parts of the heart to<br>supply and I just I love teaching with<br>these because I think they're so<br>beautiful when the students seem to<br>really enjoy them as well because<br>visually they're very appealing but<br>they're also really nice to look at and<br>so this has become something that<br>started out as a sort of a research tool<br>it's rather a teaching tool but has<br>become a bit of a research tool just as<br>a point of reference in the anatomy<br>collection now we've done hands so<br>hopefully you can all recognize a hand<br>and this is very useful again for<br>understanding the blood supply to the<br>hand and you can see a digit here now<br>all the paint or red stuff is where the<br>blood would be so that's plastic inside<br>blood vessels and you can see up here in<br>the nail beard and here on the knuckle<br>how dense that blood supply is it's a<br>really impressive how dense this<br>capillary networkers that supplies the<br>skin in fact I had to ring back this<br>finger so we could see the underlying<br>structure so I've removed detected away<br>the Sphynx<br>here from the surface here these are<br>kidneys and we use this in third year<br>renal teaching and they're really lovely<br>to look at and anyone know what this is<br>someone said it it's an eye this medical<br>students often think it's a jellyfish<br>but anyway I don't know why they think<br>I'm teaching them about jellyfish okay<br>but I think that's beautiful as well all<br>this is the blood vascular supply to<br>these organs this is one in the<br>collection this is a liver and it's got<br>multiple colors I won't go through what<br>the colors are for that this was<br>actually preparation that we made and<br>tribute to professor mark stringer a<br>great clinical anatomist and clinician<br>that was in the nephew department for<br>some years and we and this is now in the<br>collection the the so called<br>stringer liver cast but the great thing<br>about this is we can take this material<br>so at a gross level you can see the<br>lobes of the liver and the blood supply<br>but you can actually pull this material<br>out stick it under a scanning electron<br>microscope and and this is what that<br>material looks like when you look at<br>high magnification looks a bit like<br>brain coral doesn't it from the Great<br>Barrier Reef but this is actually the<br>network of capillaries in the liver that<br>are the exchange surfaces where blood<br>comes from our intestines and the<br>nutrients are exchanged with the liver<br>cells and they come through this network<br>of fine little capillaries and then out<br>through the central vein here on the<br>journey back towards the heart and I<br>again I just think it's beautiful to<br>look at this one here is sadly from a<br>person that had to have their leg<br>amputated for occlusive arterial disease<br>but they also instantly had extensive<br>varicose veins and when we cast the skin<br>of this person the this of blue resin<br>here we cast this large serpentine<br>varicose vein which again I think is<br>rather pretty to look at and the white<br>stuff over the top is actually quite<br>interesting it's the blood supply to the<br>wall of the vein so we think of veins as<br>pipes but they're actually tissue and<br>they need their own blood supply so we<br>call us the vasa vasorum the vessels of<br>the vessel so you can see this network<br>little vessels that actually supply this<br>bigger vessel and I think they're really<br>quite pretty to look at too but this<br>area over here also shows something that<br>looks a bit odd and I first saw this<br>know it was a bit confused as to what I<br>was seeing if we zoom up to higher<br>magnification like looks like little<br>balls of glass wool and if we zoom up<br>again on those you can see these little<br>tangles of what looks like glass well<br>when the risen gets it's all the same<br>color but as it gets thinner and thinner<br>it looks lighter and lighter and this<br>little tangle here is actually the blood<br>supply to an individual sweat gland so<br>it's just a different way of seeing<br>things I mean if you've looked at skin<br>histology you've might have seen a sweat<br>gland you hardly ever see the blood<br>vessels because they're all collapsed<br>but actually when you do these casts<br>it's a really neat way of looking at it<br>which is of academic curiosity and<br>interest but and pretty look at but but<br>anyway I think they're kind of cool you<br>can also take that small cluster of<br>resin and put it under a scanning<br>electron microscope and what I thought<br>was really amazing about this was that<br>it's it's such good quality the reason<br>that we use that actually pushes against<br>the surface cells and a bit like making<br>a plaster cast of the cell surface you<br>can actually make out the individual<br>cells so if I bring out their house in<br>preparation again that's what it looks<br>like<br>I'll animate three cells so you can see<br>the shape of them sort of spindle shaped<br>but look in that risen you can see the<br>shape of the three individual cells<br>these long spindle shapes because the<br>resins pushed so hard up against the<br>cells it's actually forced into the<br>little gaps between the cells and the<br>nuclei I have created these little<br>raised areas here and here which I think<br>it's kind of cool and if we look at that<br>set that tube in the back there the<br>cells don't have this long spindle shape<br>they have this rounded shape and that's<br>because this one here is a small artery<br>where the Bloods flowing quickly and the<br>cells become elongated and this one at<br>the back is a vein this blood is moving<br>more slowly and the cells have this more<br>rounded shape to them so we can even<br>tell whether we're looking at arteries<br>and veins by the shape of the<br>again this is a cast where I've injected<br>the risen this is another case with<br>someone who's head-to-head and have an<br>amputation and we recruit from these<br>patients we asked them whether they mind<br>us examining the amputated limb and and<br>many people agree to this which is it's<br>really great for our research and it's<br>very generous them to do that and I've<br>injected here into the resin into a vein<br>here and here and you can see the Risen<br>as it's gotten to the vessels under the<br>skin and when we dissolve the soft<br>tissue away that's the matching image of<br>that and that area there matches what's<br>present in the cast and if you go up to<br>high magnification and you look in these<br>venous casts these vein casts you can<br>actually see valves because in the<br>venous drainage supply of our<br>cardiovascular system there are valves<br>that make sure the blood goes back<br>towards the heart and by looking at<br>these valves very closely or the<br>impression they make in the cast we can<br>work out whether the valve is working<br>properly or not believe it or not based<br>on its the diameter of the vessel and<br>the length of the leaflet of the of the<br>valve so there's one here another one<br>here another one here<br>and we can take a cast like this and I<br>had a really great summer student some<br>years ago and summer students just<br>fantastic and I think there are there<br>are great bunch of students that come<br>and spend ten weeks doing a research<br>project and this summer student Jordan<br>Vincent actually took those casts that<br>I'd prepared and produced these maps<br>where the blue arrows and the red arrows<br>represent those valves that we were<br>seeing in the cast and he mapped whether<br>they were actually working properly or<br>not and on the basis of this we actually<br>after only 10 weeks of his work we<br>produced a really good paper which<br>informed really fundamental stuff around<br>how varicose veins form and what happens<br>to valves and which valves need to fail<br>for what bits of the skin to have reflux<br>in blood so it was really quite an<br>important observation and again it was<br>nice that Jordan could come up with this<br>nice system for mapping out those very<br>complex casts so a visual representation<br>of what was something of something that<br>is very complex but as has been alluded<br>to a lot of my workers not in the venous<br>space but in the arterial space and<br>particularly looking at abdominal aortic<br>aneurysm now dominate candor ISM is the<br>most common form of aneurysmal disease<br>and aneurysm is just a a ballooning of a<br>blood vessel to an abnormal size the<br>problem with aneurysms is that they<br>balloon up too much they can burst and<br>and typically fatal if that happens<br>outside particularly outside of a<br>hospital you can see here in this image<br>of a person the CT scan the heart is<br>here here's the a water running down<br>here and the white space is where the<br>contrast is running in the blood and<br>when we come down into the abdomen with<br>the tummy is so this would be the<br>person's belly button around here you<br>can see the sack has formed out the<br>front here with us as formed and in<br>angela's of an aneurysm and this person<br>this is a transverse slice through the<br>abdomen and so we have to orientate us<br>this is the spine here and this is the<br>muscular abdominal wall here and this is<br>this person's a auto now it should be<br>that size and you can see that in this<br>person clearly it's much larger than<br>that as a reference when the a water<br>gets to three centimeters in diameter<br>that's when we arbitrarily somewhat<br>arbitrarily define it as an aneurysm but<br>you can see in this person it's at 6<br>centimeters and that's this point this<br>person needs to have this aneurysm<br>repaired at 3 centimeters we tend to<br>watch it because there's actually more<br>risk with the surgery than there is with<br>the small aneurysm bursting but at 6<br>centimeters it needs to be dealt with so<br>a lot of our work has focused on how we<br>can look at inherited factors genetic<br>factors and environmental factors to<br>look at cardiovascular risk such as<br>abdominal aortic aneurysm so we all know<br>about risk factors like high blood<br>pressure high levels of fat and the<br>circulation we've got some biomarkers<br>that we can test diagnostically that<br>tell us about some of that risk but our<br>work has been looking started out<br>looking at genomic or inherited factors<br>that linked<br>risk factors and also risk of<br>cardiovascular disease but of course we<br>all know that there's many environmental<br>risk factors for cardiovascular disease<br>and in Triple A the number one risk<br>factor environmentally is smoking but<br>what many of people don't realize is<br>that our environment and our inherited<br>genome actually interact to form what we<br>call the epigenome where our DNA is<br>modified by the environment or the<br>lifestyle that we live in for our life<br>and so these aims here are actually four<br>methyl groups chemical modification of<br>the DNA changing the way our DNA is read<br>depending on certain environmental<br>exposures such as smoking diet etc and<br>so a lot of our work is looking at these<br>genetic markers and these epigenetic<br>markers as risk factors for<br>cardiovascular disease so I've been<br>lucky my time in cardiovascular genetics<br>has intersected with a massive growth in<br>the field so at the start of this<br>millennium there was the discovery<br>whether the the sequencing of the human<br>genome announced by Bill Clinton in the<br>White House and then a few years later<br>there was this development of all these<br>genome-wide studies for different<br>cardiovascular diseases and a whole<br>range of disorders but actually when we<br>look at 2005 this is a pictorial<br>representation of what we robustly knew<br>to be genetic Association for common<br>disorders and what these represent are<br>different chromosomes that's chromosome<br>1 through the chromosome 22 here's their<br>X chromosome here is the sad little Y<br>chromosome and what I'm going to do is<br>animate this up to show you what's<br>happened and our knowledge about robust<br>and there's a difference between what<br>was done before this time which hasn't<br>really stood the test of time and more<br>robust genome-wide associations so I'm<br>just going to animate this up and so as<br>we move into 2016 being we start to see<br>these little pinpoints coming up right<br>across the genome right across all these<br>chromosomes and it's just gone on and on<br>and on I ran across a huge range of<br>disorders and so people say we haven't<br>discovered much since sequencing the<br>human genome that's nonsense and in fact<br>if I bring that up to date now<br>68000 associations robustly associated<br>with a range of traits that's things<br>like cancer risk heart disease it's<br>things like high cholesterol blood<br>pressure etc right across the genome<br>so we've discovered a huge amount in a<br>relatively short period of time and it's<br>important to reflect on that seventy<br>seven hundred and fifty of these regions<br>are associated with cardiovascular<br>disease or strong cardiovascular disease<br>risk factors and this is going to be my<br>ones that a boastful slide it's not a<br>kiwi thing to do but our group's been<br>really fortunate we've been involved<br>with international consortium which had<br>published into the space with some<br>pretty high-impact papers and nature<br>Nature Genetics the New England Journal<br>of Medicine and particularly in<br>abdominal aortic aneurysm our group has<br>been involved with all of the<br>genome-wide Association observations<br>linked to triple-a to date and it<br>culminated in this paper that was<br>published last year which really<br>summarized the association between<br>abdominal aortic aneurysm and our<br>inherited genome and and I was proud to<br>lead that international consortium and<br>it was a lot of work there's a hundred<br>and twenty authors just getting the<br>paper into the journal was was a<br>marathon task but um but the goodwill of<br>a really multinational consortium was<br>essential and it's really quite a<br>triumph I think for for my career to<br>have seen this one over the post so what<br>are these sort of a studies look like<br>this is a Manhattan plot why is it<br>called a Manhattan plot because it's<br>like the Manhattan skyline so what are<br>we seeing here we're seeing along the<br>bottom here this these are the different<br>chromosomes and each dot represents a<br>genetic marker positioned in its<br>chromosome and in its position along the<br>chromosome so this is basically starting<br>at one end of the genome and going to<br>the other along this way and the y-axis<br>here the vertical axis is the strength<br>of the association with the particular<br>disorder and this is the genome-wide<br>Association for abdominal aortic<br>aneurysm and so we're looking for these<br>skyscrapers standing up here above all<br>this noise down here now the remarkable<br>thing about this plot<br>is that each individual that we looked<br>at had 5.3 million genetic markers<br>characterized for that individual<br>there's over 20,000 individuals involved<br>in the study and that means that this<br>plot is not a thousand words<br>it's 1.6 billion tests summarized in<br>this one plot 1.6 billion okay we've got<br>a study for Nikki's planned for the end<br>of next year which is going to start<br>well plot the plot that results from it<br>will summarize four trillion genetic<br>tests on one plot so a picture doesn't<br>tell a thousand words that tells<br>considerably more at times but I think<br>that's remarkable I think these numbers<br>if you told me this when I started my<br>career that we would be doing this kind<br>of work I probably would have laughed at<br>you but it's quite remarkable so you can<br>take an area with one of these<br>skyscrapers and that's what happens when<br>we zoom up on that and you can see here<br>these are all individual genetic tests<br>this is the peak snip here the peak<br>Association and when you drop down this<br>is the region of the genome and you we<br>know that in this part of the genome<br>there's a gene called a l6r now you<br>don't need to know what il-6 are is<br>other than to say that it's a gene that<br>we know to be associated with an<br>inflammation of blood vessels and we<br>know that's really important in Triple A<br>so this actually has identified<br>something that makes biological sense so<br>we've looked across the entire genome<br>and found something that makes sense<br>what a relief<br>so again with this kind of work we're<br>dealing with huge numbers of tests now<br>we don't just test a blood sample for<br>one thing we test for thousands of<br>things so this is a colleague's data set<br>this is actually gene expression data so<br>28,000 genes essentially and this is<br>what we call a volcano plot and again<br>the higher up in the vertical axis the<br>stronger the Association if we go to the<br>one side of the red line we're looking<br>at genes that they have an increased<br>gene expression to the other side<br>decreased gene expression and we draw a<br>line where we say above this line we<br>think it's significant and you can see<br>lots of genes which seem to have<br>significant decreased expression<br>associated with having an aneurysm and a<br>few genes which have increased gene<br>expression<br>so that's a gene expression volcano plot<br>but this is where the visual<br>representation becomes important this is<br>our epigenetic data set using the same<br>plotting technique the volcano plot<br>we're looking at changes in DNA now that<br>are influenced by our environment and<br>when I look at this there's 28,000<br>markers for the gene expression there's<br>nearly half a million markers for our<br>epigenetic Association here but what I<br>look at and I see this this is where the<br>visual thing comes and I see something<br>very different in the pattern on this<br>side I see like a set of wings on this<br>side I see as like a bird wings versus a<br>set of butterfly wings because I'm<br>seeing this funny little sub winglet<br>down the bottom here and here and the<br>question becomes what is that why is<br>that different about this data set to<br>the other what is it about that pattern<br>can we make any sense of that and it<br>turns out those little winglets at the<br>bottom are really important because they<br>are if I color code those are the parts<br>of this epigenetic landscape which are<br>influenced by what we've inherited from<br>our parents so some parts of our genome<br>they're pretty much the same in every<br>one other parts will all be different in<br>the room those ones at the bottom there<br>have what we call snips they're they're<br>different polymorphic between<br>individuals and those polymorphic sites<br>and those little winglets and we can use<br>that pattern to identify them really<br>clearly and I think it stands out quite<br>nicely and that's why I think some of<br>these visual representations can be<br>really informative incidentally that<br>cluster up there changes that are driven<br>by smoking and there's been a dozen<br>studies that have shown that exact same<br>set of clusters associated with smoking<br>and we see them in this aneurysm group<br>and that makes sense because these<br>aneurysm patients are really heavy<br>smokers and believe it or not this is<br>also one of these data sets again about<br>half a million tests and we're looking<br>at it and what we call principal<br>components analysis and I just think it<br>looks kind of cool but it's also a real<br>data set and it's looking at the<br>relationship between all these markers<br>and how well they correlate<br>each other but it's pretty to look at<br>but it actually tells us about something<br>very interesting because when we start<br>to funnel this down and winner this down<br>to a set of markers we end up with<br>something look that looks like this<br>which again is quite well I think very<br>pretty but actually this set of markers<br>and the relationship between them tells<br>you what blood cells are running around<br>in the circulation of that person and<br>you can use the set of markers to<br>predict how many of all the different<br>types of blood cells and individual<br>hairs without actually measuring them<br>directly it's kind of cool and and if<br>you've got a sort of a an RTI I think<br>the plot itself is just nice to look at<br>but it's real data and it is telling us<br>something really informative about blood<br>and that actually turns out to be a very<br>useful thing to know to be able to take<br>the set of markers and actually predict<br>someone's blood cell composition and we<br>use that a lot in our research this is<br>what we call a heat map and this is an<br>important one that's looking at coronary<br>artery disease the number one killer in<br>our society coronary artery disease the<br>blockage of the arteries that supply the<br>heart muscle itself this is a study<br>where this plot in itself summarizes<br>1050 individual sets along this way so<br>each of these columns represents an<br>individual and for each individual we're<br>looking at the values for five hundred<br>odd markers down this way here is rose<br>and what I hope you can see is that the<br>people that don't have disease the<br>coronary artery disease free controls<br>and the people that do have disease have<br>different patterns and so we're using<br>these epigenetic markers to distinguish<br>from people with disease and without<br>disease the some in the middle here that<br>we really can't distinguish between but<br>most of the cases have these markers<br>that are colored green because they're<br>going down and these ones are red<br>because they're going up and it's the<br>opposite for the controls so we can<br>visually represent this very complex<br>data set in a way that makes some sense<br>to us finally another again with the<br>theme of a visual representation and<br>going back to Bill Stebbins idea about<br>you know really challenging ideas and<br>not accepting everything at face value<br>this is our Otago Southland pop<br>population that we've been looking at<br>for many years for the prevalence of<br>aneurysmal disease related to the lot of<br>the genetic work that we've been doing<br>and this is typical of what you would<br>see in most countries around the world<br>certainly Western countries where the<br>prevalence of disease if we use the<br>standard 30 millimeter diameter if<br>you're larger than 30 millimeters we say<br>you've got an aneurysm if we use that in<br>our Tiger Southam population 4.8% of men<br>meet that criteria and only half there<br>or less than half that a woman meet that<br>criteria and more importantly in some<br>ways if we look at the trajectory of<br>prevalence over the top over age we see<br>that the men seem to get more disease as<br>they get older compared to to woman but<br>there's a problem here and it's shown in<br>this picture here men and woman aren't<br>the same size and yet we're using a size<br>30 millimeters which is based on the<br>size that we consider to be an aneurysm<br>and Men but we also apply that to woman<br>and that's silly okay woman have a<br>reference diameter of 17 millimeters<br>whereas this woman's husband has a<br>reference diameter of 21 millimeters 20<br>percent larger so we shouldn't be using<br>the same size and actually there's a<br>very easy way to fix this we just adjust<br>these we divide the aortic dimension by<br>your body surface area and we adjust for<br>your body size and it works very nicely<br>and men when we do this we get the same<br>result because that 30 millimeters was<br>based on average size male and so the<br>prevalence data in this plot using this<br>a or text size and X which is just a<br>otic size divided by your body size<br>comes up exactly the same 4.8% that's<br>exactly what we saw before but when we<br>do this a woman we see something very<br>different and I hope you can see now<br>that it's gone from two point one to<br>four point one percent this is important<br>because around the world aneurysm<br>screening programs have focused on men<br>over 65 and the belief that this is a<br>disease of men what this study shows you<br>as that as a that is incorrect there<br>actually this is not a disease just of<br>men<br>we've just been using the wrong<br>threshold and just last week<br>show something that's right up-to-date<br>we published in the European Journal a<br>study that showed that correcting for<br>body surface area identifies the true<br>prevalence of aneurysmal disease and<br>woman and that the difference that have<br>been reported widely internationally in<br>the literature and has actually<br>influenced clinical practice because in<br>the UK they only screen men over 65 that<br>it's really an artifact of that single<br>of that male derived absolute threshold<br>and that was a mistake so to all the<br>students and the room the younger people<br>in the room and my colleagues you will<br>always have to question stuff that we<br>assume to be right but you need to know<br>that it's right and this is an example<br>where questioning that Dogma actually<br>could change the way we deliver health<br>services and I hope for example in New<br>Zealand that will do that because we<br>know we have a problem with aneurysms<br>and and Marty woman Marty woman have<br>prevalence of aneurysmal disease which<br>is the same as men when we use a male<br>threshold so they've probably got even<br>worse disease because when we adjust for<br>body surface area I think we'll find<br>that there's a significant issue with<br>Marty woman which also accounts for why<br>they tend to have that as a younger and<br>more severely so I'd like to finish the<br>and just think again you for for coming<br>along today and I hope you've got a sort<br>of a snapshot of what I do and why I<br>love what I do like to thank people in<br>the room Andre my long-standing<br>collaborator Vicky Phillips who's worked<br>with ever since I've come back to Otago<br>that the risk the vascular surgeons here<br>in Dunedin the vascular diagnostics lab<br>have done a huge amount of the scanning<br>work required here Sean and Michael my<br>colleagues and cardiology a great<br>collaborators selling McCormick Tony<br>Mirra man this New Zealand vascular<br>Research Consortium a network of<br>clinicians throughout the country that<br>have really bonded together in a common<br>cause and of course my international<br>colleagues which you know it's a really<br>the cornerstone of a lot what a lot of<br>what I do now but most importantly I<br>want to thank my family and Laughlin's<br>cringing because this is a very<br>old photo of him when we went to Vietnam<br>and he's considerably taller now but<br>none of us is important without you guys<br>so thank you very much<br>kyouda gig marc thompson forceps my name<br>on the head of department of surgical<br>sciences we're Griggs a very valued<br>member and it's my role to give him a<br>vote of thanks for his IPO oration that<br>you've just heard and you did deliver<br>Gregg on demonstrating with images how<br>you've told the story of your research<br>and Greg's a very effective communicator<br>and this has been demonstrated by his<br>talk but also a success how he's worked<br>successfully with clinicians who often<br>sort operate in a different paradigm and<br>he's been very successful communicating<br>with funders because he said a long<br>stream of success with the Health<br>Research Council in good funding which<br>is um been good for our department as<br>well but also communicating his research<br>through publications and presentations<br>and when he presents in our departmental<br>seminars I can understand it and it's<br>you've seen here a lot of he's got into<br>genetics and this it can be quite<br>confusing to the to the amateur dienes<br>geneticist but Gregor wise breaks it<br>down as you've seen to to make it clear<br>and I remember Greg was around justice I<br>sort of came to the department in<br>1999-2000 and I can remember Andre was<br>desperate to get this young great clever<br>guy back and I think they were competing<br>interests but I was a good call Andre<br>and it's been a very successful so thank<br>you Greg for everything if you<br>contributed to the department as well as<br>Helen outlined at the beginning you are<br>very collegial and you contribute and<br>teaching in other areas as well and in<br>service in the university and you're a<br>and you've also demonstrated great<br>dexterity you know I just seeing all<br>those things fly through they realize<br>it's very appropriate that you're in a<br>department of surgery but maybe we don't<br>have schools quite as dexterous as yours<br>but you've transitioned tutoring through<br>your research into genetics from<br>starting off with the more sort of<br>tissue related specimens and you're very<br>humble guy - it took them quite a bit of<br>cajoling to put an application to be<br>promoted to<br>sir several years but it all look pretty<br>obvious on paper that he could have done<br>it a bit sooner um so thank you very<br>much Greg for your IPO oration and<br>before the final parting duty I've just<br>got to remind you that you're all<br>invited to some nice refreshments and<br>wine and nibbles in the union common<br>room not the usual sights and the staff<br>common room because that's busy so it's<br>over towards the link and there'll be I<br>think people to direct you so Greg I<br>have a gift here to give you there's a<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
