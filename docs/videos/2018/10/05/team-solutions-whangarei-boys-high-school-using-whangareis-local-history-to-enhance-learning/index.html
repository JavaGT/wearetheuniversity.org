By connecting learning to these events, teachers have been able to raise student engagement and academic outcomes.<br> <br>For more information, visit

culturally<br>responsive and relational pedagogy with<br>team solutions fungally boys high school<br>have implemented several projects<br>focusing on connecting students learning<br>to Northlands rich history using nearby<br>archaeological sites in resources I<br>teach social studies at year 10 one of<br>the topics we teaches the Treaty of<br>Waitangi and responses to the Treaty of<br>Waitangi and we made a conscious<br>decision a number of years ago to make<br>our our focus in year 10 for that unit<br>to be about the Norden Wars because<br>often this was something that was lifted<br>out of textbooks when I was a student<br>and if you look at the second of quarter<br>Erica and the start of the northern laws<br>that very much as a local story and<br>ending in the Battle of rural pika pika<br>where many of our boys will a<br>popper back to either to ducky coyote or<br>horny Hickey and so what we noticed in<br>studying those Wars suddenly you have an<br>engagement not just among Somali boys in<br>the class but all because and I don't to<br>generalize too much but boys and war you<br>know it can be quite engaging for some<br>of them and also to know that this was<br>on their back doorstep and that when<br>they drive past were a picker picker and<br>they see that Brown sign going go and<br>visit that's why because this was this<br>was a phenomenally important time<br>especially for Nabu and that that<br>resonates today in the last year an old<br>Marley's Stonefield garden has been<br>discovered beside the hearty river<br>within walking distance of the school we<br>worked with the archaeologists from here<br>to New Zealand to understand what we're<br>looking at and at the end of last year<br>we took 22 staff from science and social<br>studies to visit the site so we<br>developed a joint unit between science<br>and social studies across quickly unit<br>and took each year 10 class down and a<br>joint study there and then came back and<br>continued studying<br>the findings and the cigarettes with us<br>within those classes the joint unit with<br>science and social studies was developed<br>and as we got into the planning of that<br>English wanted to join us in that unit<br>so they had had something to write about<br>with all of the boys from year 9 and in<br>the Terrell Marley classes both junior<br>and senior used the visit as a topic to<br>base the boys writing on intend one so<br>we were able to take each class down<br>there and back within an hour and a half<br>so which makes that quite sustainable<br>and it's now embedded in a year nine<br>programs as part of the introductory<br>unit the subsequent of this working with<br>the local museum Kiwi north we<br>discovered that they had a large supply<br>of coal which are digging sticks and<br>other gardening implements and also Toki<br>which eye aids us and then fishing<br>weights and mooring weights for Walker<br>so we convinced them that it would be a<br>good idea to bring that down to the<br>school which they've never done before<br>and so they brought that down to the<br>school and over two days we rotated<br>their TN classes through that display<br>with the archaeologists explaining what<br>was the air and its significance and we<br>then started exploring the sources of<br>the stone that these items were made<br>from and it turns out that they've come<br>from all over New Zealand yes the stone<br>it was clearly traded around the place<br>so we've got stone here that has come<br>from Nelson from the Coromandel from<br>Muir Island and local stone as well<br>there is a local quarry of chaired which<br>is a type of Flint and I've followed<br>that down talked a museum where there<br>are the largest selection of this was<br>taken their amazing collection of adzes<br>and we're that fit century from that we<br>are developing a wider unit and to the<br>technology that's involved and living at<br>that time another part of the project is<br>developing a cultural garden at school<br>so I'm going to be given access to<br>traditional Maori camera<br>which have come back from Japan and will<br>also in the process of getting samples<br>of flags from the National collection<br>which have got known pedagogy's going<br>back hundreds of years for different<br>uses and walker and Weavin and also<br>goods so in the process of setting up a<br>garden which will behead this material<br>growing in school which the flecks in<br>particular will be able to be used by a<br>number of faculties who are very keen to<br>get access to it and use it in a<br>productive way on their Jeju the student<br>response has been really amazing it's<br>given the boys somewhere to stay in<br>something to be proud of it is linked<br>all of the students together so it's<br>their place so we've taken the sense of<br>belonging to the school which is very<br>strong to a sense of belonging and place<br>within the wider landscape of the school<br>as part of hacker is clearly visible in<br>the skyline from the school and so we've<br>got this very significant sites which<br>are fundamentally unrecognized<br>in the community and we're able to teach<br>our boys that these are significant<br>places and there is a long history of<br>human occupation on this area something</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
