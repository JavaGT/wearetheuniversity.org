Ensuring their success as Māori is vital and is a priority for the school's leadership team. To support the school's goals, Team Solutions facilitators have worked with the school leaders and teachers to help them adapt their pedagogy to focus on a more culturally responsive and relational approach to teaching and engaging with students’ whānau, hapu and iwi.<br> <br>For more information, visit http://teamsolutions.ac.nz.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

me<br>fundamentally every student should have<br>the same high expectations and high<br>aspirations and my observations both<br>through the data and the way the<br>students behaved at school and Akita to<br>me that they neither had a sense of<br>connection here nor a sense that there<br>were higher aspirations held for them so<br>we really needed to change that culture<br>and left achievement for all students<br>overall the school population is 40%<br>Maori and for the first time this year<br>we have more Maori boys in unite than we<br>do any other ethnicity so the mandate is<br>there to improve outcomes for young<br>Maori men in Northland and across New<br>Zealand the reason we engaged with the<br>culturally responsive in relational<br>pedagogy program was quite simply to<br>close the gap between Maori and<br>non-maori achievement and we know that<br>what's good for money is good for all I<br>think it was really important to in<br>order to initially make change to<br>explore the concept of for knowing a<br>tongue of that idea around caring<br>connectedness that relationship<br>fundamentally important to the students<br>and the Farne the first thing that was<br>explored as a staff and groups not not<br>necessarily as a whole staff but in<br>groups around what for knowing Otunga<br>that idea of care and connectedness and<br>building relational trust really might<br>look like and sound like and teachers<br>were able to consider that and makes<br>incremental changes to the practice in<br>the classroom one of the biggest things<br>we know that works for boys is about<br>that they understand that we care so<br>they don't care how much you know until<br>they know how much you care is often a<br>phrase that is bandied about when they<br>know you care and when they know you're<br>genuine and authentic then that two-way<br>I guess teaching and learning approach<br>becomes a lot more fluid and a lot more<br>obvious and clear the boys can feel it<br>if you're genuine and that's around the<br>spirit of our core I suppose we learn<br>from boys as much as they learn from us<br>embracing Maori culture has been another<br>significant shift that the school has<br>made in fact when I first came to the<br>school there was a poor free to welcome<br>me in so that was really special and<br>continues to be special for me we have a<br>school haka which all of the boys learn<br>we have school why I tell which all of<br>the boys learn and that becomes<br>certainly our way of being that's how<br>it's going to be for every boy at this<br>school a cool chase the sea was happy<br>schools embrace off kapa haka and how<br>she enjoys out watching in our joys of<br>being a part of our growth as a group as<br>a couple encouraged us to push further<br>beyond all of us it feels empowering<br>that they are embracing our culture with<br>our values and a lot our ideals as Maori<br>and abrasive our language and our<br>culture as well as our wertha bring that<br>into our scene Belize is quite joyous<br>that they are doing this in a embracing<br>us as people and our culture in our<br>language in recent years we've had a<br>very active and progressive group of<br>parents who have been part of cultural<br>Katie Roney<br>they've renamed it and rebranded that<br>group of Maori parents for support in<br>the school and they have influenced<br>quite a lot of the things that we do in<br>the school for instance they questioned<br>the way in which we selected who<br>prefigures with a view to heaven wall of<br>our Maori boys becoming prefix and so we<br>have widened the criteria and the men on<br>which those boys are selected so they<br>can now be nominated by our staff and<br>other students whereas before it was<br>very much a self promotion exercise<br>which we recognized was not cold for a<br>responsive to the needs of some of those<br>boys who were much quieter leaders over<br>the past three years from the beginning<br>when it first started to now it's been a<br>massive difference and communication<br>first of all because we were just<br>starting now you know they were bit of<br>just us getting initiated but now it's<br>just back and forth back and forth all<br>the time you know them inviting us to<br>some of their professional<br>of elements as far no since then it's<br>just been a really good opportunity for<br>us to be part of a group that can have<br>some influences and we have a member<br>that's on the board so they bring back<br>some of the communication from the board<br>to us and we can give our thoughts with<br>our representative to be able to take<br>back to the board so there's all this<br>communication yep any team solutions<br>have been with us every step of the way<br>on this process and really guided us<br>through what for some people was<br>reasonably challenging I'm really happy<br>with the level of achievement that we've<br>reached and I think know for us as a<br>school we want to maintain that level we<br>you know track really well against<br>schools nationally a good example at<br>level two in 2014 we're sitting around<br>50% for a pass rate for multi boys<br>that's now up to eighty percent so in<br>2017 we got 80% of our multi boys<br>succeeding at level two and that's just<br>one outcome you know that's an academic<br>outcome there's all the other measures<br>the more intangible things I suppose and<br>certainly you know when we speak to the<br>boys they feel good about being here so<br>our next big step is to see how we can<br>embed this process so that it's<br>sustainable at boys high in the future<br>because everything that we're hearing<br>both from staff and from students and<br>from the parent community tells us that<br>you</p></main><footer
