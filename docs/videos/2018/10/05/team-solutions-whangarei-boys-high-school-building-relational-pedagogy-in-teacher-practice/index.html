more relational and reciprocal focus to teaching, Whangarei Boys’ High School was able to create a learning environment where teachers and students work collaboratively to develop a deeper understanding of new ideas.<br> <br>For more information, visit http://teamsolutions.ac.nz.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>teachers at Fung at a boys high school<br>worked with team solutions facilitators<br>to develop a more relational in<br>reciprocal focus to their teaching<br>creating classroom environments with<br>students and the teachers work<br>collaboratively to develop their<br>understanding of new ideas we identified<br>that we had a number of students who<br>were not achieving as highly as we<br>wanted to and we identified the<br>relationship between the student and the<br>teacher was particularly important in<br>this field from a relational point of<br>view it was really important to<br>encourage the staff to give a little bit<br>more of themselves so every staff member<br>has their own baby heart that they use<br>for their classes when they meet them we<br>talked about getting to know the<br>students not just the boy who's sitting<br>in front of you but where they come from<br>who they're connected to what their<br>local knowledge is what their New<br>Zealand knowledge is so that we are<br>learning mutually from each other the<br>student-teacher bond the dynamic with<br>reseeding teachers has changed a whole<br>lot of the years I feel there is also<br>being bet on teachers is higher than the<br>student is completely changed now that<br>we're all equal and it's more me true me<br>now is younger<br>he's afraid of some of my teachers<br>because I don't wanna govern ask for<br>help because I felt that I'll get put<br>down because I don't know but analysis<br>that that level was changed is more<br>there I feel more comfortable asking my<br>teachers for help and talking to them<br>the more students in trick so when we're<br>walking into a class they're not<br>standing up at the front of the class<br>drawing on the board they are sitting<br>with the student and teaching the class<br>from there they're more open to roam<br>around and help others instead of<br>sitting at a desk in x15 the students<br>come up to them they like to feel as a<br>whip all one class not divided into<br>little groups that your smart ones words<br>it<br>the teachers are pushing for everyone<br>it's more relatable to younger students<br>there's not a difference between like a<br>teacher and a student there's like their<br>personal level there makes a lot easier<br>to relate to the teacher and makes it<br>easy for the teacher to teach us and<br>were asked to be learning from our<br>teachers in terms of other changes that<br>we've noticed around the school we were<br>in a situation where we had a high<br>standard suspension and exclusion rate<br>for Maori boys and again that was an<br>unacceptable status quo to be moving<br>forward with so what we're seeing is<br>unsurprisingly our students have become<br>more engaged in their learning their<br>behavior changes around the classroom<br>and that a relational approach rather<br>than a punitive approach has paid<br>dividends to changing those statistics<br>so we're in a much better place going<br>forward with managing behavior part of<br>the work we've done with keiki Panico is<br>around surveying our our boys in our<br>parent community and they've come back<br>year-on-year to say you know with<br>improvements in those spaces about how<br>it feels to be muddy at this school that<br>the boys have every opportunity they<br>need to succeed right down to you know<br>how are you how you finding lessons how<br>you're relating to your teachers and<br>we're seeing a steady improvement the<br>great thing about that is there's a<br>direct correlation between what what the<br>boys are telling us what the families<br>are telling us what the staff are<br>telling us and what the results are<br>telling us chase my son yeah he's<br>definitely made a change from when he<br>first started he actually at one point<br>said I don't know yes I find some of the<br>teachers don't understand us or I find<br>there they don't they're not more<br>encouraging to him or his students when<br>he first started but the difference now<br>especially encouraging them for the<br>academic achievement that's been a<br>really good one it's really helped chase<br>think differently there<br>I can do it and that's supporting him<br>you know when he does a an assignment<br>and they encourage and I look for you to<br>get a better grade do this right and so<br>they're getting alongside I think more<br>encouraging and give them a little bit<br>more Southworth that you can do it we<br>tend to have the mindset sometimes their<br>asses moldy we're not going to make it<br>or we're not going to do well but over<br>that time he's seen a difference too<br>you know through our conversations that<br>we've had a little bit more courage in<br>you know a lot more respectful they<br>starting to understand as well and<br>that's a conversation that he's had with<br>me you know because I always ask him<br>like stuff like that and yeah it's right<br>a big impact on her many's off to<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
