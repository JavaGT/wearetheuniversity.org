Russell Bishop to Mary<br>Berryman and others so that on the<br>surface of it can look like quite a<br>complicated analysis of what you're<br>trying to achieve but in those PD<br>sessions the unpacking of that has been<br>really useful for staff to think ok I<br>will that that that means about relating<br>to boys I can do that or I can do that<br>better so it's the I guess that<br>unpacking of some of the academic<br>language that's part of it it's also<br>being able to model how you would how<br>you'd be a good observer or a good<br>shadow coach so that's been that's been<br>yeah really positive in terms of once<br>you've gone and done the observation how<br>do you then have that critical<br>conversation with your with your coach<br>about how to improve their practice and<br>as I said before it's more about<br>reflection but it requires it requires a<br>very non-judgmental approach often as<br>teachers we see something in a class we<br>think oh they maybe could have done it<br>that way that's not the role the role of<br>the observers not to interpret it's just<br>to present it's that forced reflection<br>at a deeper level that that I feel<br>creates sustainable change I think the<br>other thing too is about<br>that the observation to it very much<br>looks at the mighty boys in your rope<br>and so it makes you more conscious to<br>think am I getting through to all the<br>students in my class and essentially I<br>see this very much as a you know in that<br>terms of personalization of learning and<br>when you when you look at you know<br>critics like or theorists like Hattie<br>and so on working in the field of<br>education he talks a lot about know thy<br>student it fits perfectly into that mold<br>of know thy student if you don't know<br>who you've got in front of you how can<br>you possibly get the best outcomes for<br>them<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
