in Qatar with a perm<br>on our row rocket Adama tena koe tu<br>tena koe tow tena tato katoa on behalf<br>of the University of Otago I would like<br>to warmly welcome all of you to Patrick<br>Manning's IPL as I look out on this<br>audience I see that it includes it's<br>typical diversity there are academic<br>staff and students from throughout the<br>university there are professional staff<br>members of the University Council and<br>members of the wider Dunedin public you<br>are all very very welcome to be here I'd<br>like to give a very special warm welcome<br>however to Patrick's family and friends<br>who were here this evening either in<br>person or who are joining us by the<br>miracle of the Internet<br>first and foremost I'd like to<br>acknowledge his wife Deb who is here and<br>his daughter Annie who is here in person<br>as well as his sons Tom and Jack who I<br>think are joining us by livestream his<br>sister Jo Manning is here with us this<br>evening and she's a professor of law at<br>Auckland University and she is joined by<br>her husband Tony Edward Patrick's nine<br>almost 90 year old father Jack Manning<br>hopefully is also joining us by<br>livestream and on behalf of the<br>University of Otago Jack senior I would<br>like to wish you a very happy birthday<br>in the days to come and I'd also like to<br>acknowledge his in-laws Marie and Diane<br>Kirk who are also joining us by<br>livestream<br>there are also friends of the Mannings<br>who are he have joined both from near<br>and far to be here as well as Patrick's<br>colleagues from the endocrinology<br>department and the Department of<br>Medicine so all of us have gathered here<br>this evening either in person or through<br>the internet to celebrate Patrick<br>Manning's promotion to Professor from my<br>perspective<br>Patrick Manning is an outstanding<br>exemplar of a University of Otago<br>professor<br>he's a gifted teacher who delivers high<br>quality innovative and research-led<br>teaching to medical students trainees<br>and endocrinology GPS nurses and allied<br>health professionals he's also a<br>world-class researcher who is known for<br>both the quality and the creativity of<br>his work he's the recipient of multiple<br>large-scale research grants and his<br>papers have been published in top-tier<br>international journals he's known as a<br>team player and has fostered a number of<br>highly productive collaborations with<br>his colleagues in nutrition neuroscience<br>cardiology and genetics and as I look<br>out this evening I see many of those<br>colleagues here this evening<br>he's also assumed leadership positions<br>locally nationally and internationally<br>and he's worked very hard to communicate<br>the challenges of diabetes to the<br>general public<br>now given the quantity and quality of<br>his teaching research and service it's<br>easy to forget that professor Manning<br>has accomplished all of these academic<br>milestones while also maintaining a full<br>medical practice I for one am extremely<br>humbled by his dedication and his hard<br>work now tonight we are going to learn<br>more about how professor Manning has<br>managed to balance his dual roles as an<br>academic and a clinician so Patrick on<br>behalf of the university of otago I<br>would like to warmly congratulate you on<br>your very well-deserved promotion to<br>Professor Nami he knew iki aqua and I<br>will now call on professor Barry Taylor<br>to tell us just a little bit more about<br>your academic journey and professional<br>history<br>noreda tena koe tow tena koe tow tena<br>qrow everybody it is my pleasure to<br>introduce Patrick who I've known most of<br>his life because he's been in Dunedin<br>since he arrived here as a<br>endocrinologist with Southern thb as<br>well as clinical senior lecturer with<br>the Dunedin School of Medicine in 1993<br>at that stage I was newly appointed<br>senior lecturer as well in that from<br>child health area and also trained in<br>pediatric endocrinology and so when I<br>had a difficult problem I would often go<br>and talk to Patrick and always got very<br>sage advice and I think that that is one<br>of his characteristics that is actually<br>a base of knowledge at both the complex<br>of endocrinology and people who know<br>about hormones knows it's probably the<br>most complex area of the body to<br>actually understand because wherever you<br>go whether it's the brain or the heart<br>endocrinology has got everything to do<br>with it so you've got to know a bit<br>about it well you've got know a lot<br>about everything to be an<br>endocrinologist and he demonstrates that<br>really precisely well he graduated<br>actually not her so University of Otago<br>graduate he went through Auckland<br>University graduating there in 1982 and<br>stayed on and then worked in Auckland as<br>a house surgeon and registrar going on<br>to a research fellowship at the<br>Middlesex Hospital in London which<br>strangely enough is where I'd been two<br>years before during my research<br>fellowship in the same hospital we were<br>just commenting before that is now<br>currently a big hole in the ground<br>because the whole hospital has been<br>demolished and he will tell us a bit<br>more about that time but those were<br>exciting and wonderful times when you're<br>a research fellow and you can actually<br>do some clinical practice but also<br>explore some areas that you've never<br>really thought about before he came back<br>here as a senior lecturer as I said and<br>practicing endocrinologist and as<br>Harleen has just pointed out he's<br>managed to combine an academic career<br>while also doing almost full-time role<br>as an endocrinologist at the hospital<br>and so there be many patients right<br>throughout the southern region who will<br>be grateful for his<br>expertise in this area I think because<br>of his expertise in many areas he's<br>collaborated widely so when you look at<br>his publications which now number more<br>than a hundred in a peer-reviewed<br>literature you see a wide range of<br>interests and I've been especially<br>fascinated over the last few years in<br>particular to see his interest go into<br>obesity and obesity determinants and in<br>particular how the brain controls how<br>you eat and we may hear a wee bit about<br>that as we go through so so his<br>interests are broad are broad within the<br>field of endocrinology but also within<br>the whole field of medicine I thought it<br>should also point out that he's been<br>actively involved in the teaching<br>program for our medical students and at<br>one stage spent a long period actually<br>organizing a significant proportion of<br>that and so he has actually had an<br>enormous breadth of both teaching and<br>research experience while actively in<br>clinical practice the expectations have<br>actually joined our joint clinical staff<br>for people who have got foot in both<br>camps of both clinical practice and<br>research are actually usually incredibly<br>productive people and I find that in<br>fact the because of access to the real<br>questions that need to be answered in<br>real life so it keeps you grounded it<br>keeps you really connected with what the<br>issues are that need research and then<br>if you collaborate with the right people<br>you can bring you know the specialist<br>expertise or basic science and other<br>people into a research project but then<br>is usually very productive and very<br>meaningful for the actual people around<br>so it's really with great pleasure that<br>I welcome and congratulate Patrick on<br>this IPL it's always a special occasion<br>and I'm certainly looking forward to<br>hearing his his comments on his career<br>to date Thank You Patrick<br>Thank You Harlan and Thank You berry<br>vice-chancellor deputy vice-chancellors<br>Dean of the School of Medicine fellow<br>academics colleagues family and friends<br>welcome I would also like to<br>specifically extend a warm welcome to<br>students here this evening for example<br>these ones this is my clinical skills<br>group at our final tutorial of the year<br>yesterday they're a great bunch of<br>students some of them are here this<br>evening but as you'll note there's<br>always one right the gown that I'm<br>wearing this evening is that of the<br>Royal Australasian College of Physicians<br>and I chose to wear this because first<br>and foremost I am a clinician in the<br>title that's been bestowed upon me is<br>that of clinical professor<br>so expectation weighs heavily on me<br>tonight and given that you're all such a<br>desperate not desperate desperate group<br>I wondered to myself what I could talk<br>about that would interest the majority<br>of you most would it be an in-depth<br>account of the effect of glucagon-like<br>peptide one on the molecular pathways<br>involved an adipocyte differentiation or<br>a brief overview of my career pointing<br>out some of the research highlights and<br>interest in patients along the way so<br>no I couldn't do that to you<br>I was raised in Auckland the fact that I<br>seldom divulge down here in Otago indeed<br>the only time I had previously heard the<br>term jeffer was in relationship to the<br>delicious confectionary produced by the<br>local Cadbury's factory so I initially<br>took it as a compliment when people<br>called me by that term when I first<br>arrived here in Dunedin my father Jack<br>was an architect and designed the house<br>that I was raised in this is a house<br>that Jack built<br>my mother Prue was a kindergarten<br>teacher and at a political science<br>degree later in life both had enquiring<br>minds and they raised their three<br>children in an atmosphere which was<br>nurturing stimulating and most of all<br>encouraging my two older siblings Joe<br>and Bill went on to tertiary education<br>so it seemed like it was a natural<br>progression for me to both did law<br>degrees and it may have been viewed that<br>the family was now sufficiently<br>lawyered-up that I was steered in a<br>different direction in addition I had<br>to be honest I am proud of my siblings<br>and interesting me they both have a<br>connection to medicine my sister Jo has<br>gone on to become a professor of law at<br>Auckland University and is arguably New<br>Zealand's foremost authority on<br>medico-legal law my brother Bill is a<br>barrister in Auckland and much of his<br>work involves defending doctors who find<br>themselves in legal difficulty why I<br>chose Mid sin' however I have no idea I<br>really had no exposure to myths in other<br>than the rare visit to the GP who seemed<br>like a fairly nice guy and a white coat<br>and in retrospect that was ludicrous<br>that I was making a decision on the<br>occupation I would commit myself to for<br>the rest of my life and my final year of<br>high school at the age of 17 from my<br>interaction with medical students over<br>many years I believe a strong argument<br>can be put forward for medicine actually<br>being a postgraduate Entry Program I was<br>also reasonably naive at this age and<br>certainly I had not had a vast array of<br>worldly experiences I was also a little<br>quirky just before entering medical<br>school I was relieved from my duties as<br>a drummer and a punk rock band because I<br>had no timing I was demoted to backup<br>vocals which was a very uncommon<br>position in a planked rock band<br>and my problem was however that I was<br>also tone-deaf and couldn't hold a tune<br>as a result my microphone was<br>permanently switched off and I'm pretty<br>sure I invented lip synching so at the<br>end of high school I applied to Otago<br>and Auckland medical schools and was<br>accepted to both I then made one of my<br>worst ever decisions nevertheless<br>Auckland medical school was still a<br>stimulating and for the most enjoyable<br>experience I do strongly regret not<br>coming to o-tar go because it is not so<br>much the academic experience which<br>frankly I believe is equal at both<br>institutions but the unique life<br>experiences that our student gains by<br>living in Dunedin this was the reason<br>why we encouraged all of our children to<br>move to a hall of residence here in<br>Dunedin on starting University rather<br>than stay at home well that's what we<br>told them anyway<br>having completed medical school I then<br>had to decide which direction within<br>medicine I would take I was told by a<br>surgeon that I had no dexterity and that<br>fortunately I had already decided that<br>surgery did not appeal to me my later<br>attempts at home handyman skills are a<br>testament to this having been a wise<br>decision<br>so physician training is what I decided<br>on and once I had passed the horrendous<br>part one physicians examination<br>endocrinology was the subspecialty I<br>chose this area of Medicine appealed to<br>me because it was so logical yet there<br>were still many areas that remained a<br>mystery I was also working at the time<br>for two general physicians in Auckland<br>who inspired me<br>doctors pet-friendly and John Hindley<br>the next major influence on me were the<br>endocrinologist who worked in Auckland<br>Hospital endocrinology service K AB<br>ittsan Ian Holloway my Croxon and Ian<br>Reed they're all excellent clinicians<br>but also exposed me for the first time<br>to clinical research and the possibility<br>of a career in academic medicine my<br>first ever exposure to clinical research<br>was a study that K had devised he had<br>noted that patients with growth hormone<br>producing tumours a condition called<br>acromial II developed small bony<br>prominences on their ribs a bit like<br>those seen in rickets to investigate<br>this we had a number of people with air<br>chromic early and an equal number of<br>normal people come into the clinic and<br>be placed on bids Kaia Batson e'en<br>hauled away and myself within<br>blindfolded and led to the study<br>participants we then examined the<br>somewhat startled participants<br>chest-wall for these bumps this was<br>prior to ethics committees the study<br>took a single morning to complete was<br>submitted within a week and was<br>published in the lancet one of the most<br>prestigious medical journals I think it<br>was probably one of the first truly<br>blinded studies it was customary in<br>those days to go abroad for a few years<br>to finish off ones training by this time<br>I was married and we had two young<br>children we set off to London where I<br>worked as senior registrar to professor<br>Howard Jacobs at the central Middlesex<br>Hospital we stayed at William Goodenough<br>house a hall of residence in Russell<br>Square that was specifically for people<br>from the Commonwealth who were studying<br>in London Howard Jacobs was a<br>world-renowned authority on polycystic<br>ovarian syndrome so this became my area<br>of research for the next few years<br>the senior registrar position also<br>carried a substantial clinical load I<br>thoroughly enjoyed this clinical<br>experience because we were transferred<br>transferred very many interesting<br>patients from all over England and<br>sometimes abroad with unusual and<br>complex endocrine disorders many of<br>which I will never see again<br>one such patient was the Minister for<br>food from India as you can imagine being<br>responsible for all of the food in India<br>meant you were a fairly important person<br>it had a mysterious illness for some<br>years and his health was progressively<br>deteriorating we eventually diagnosed<br>him with histoplasmosis of the adrenal<br>glands a rare fungal infection and he<br>recovered to full health with treatment<br>how Jacobs had many trips to India after<br>that<br>it was then time to return to New<br>Zealand a consultant position in<br>Auckland that I'd coveted fell through<br>at the last moment leaving us in a<br>quandary at the same time David Stewart<br>here in Dunedin retired from clinical<br>practice as an endocrinologist to become<br>the assistant vice chancellor for Health<br>Sciences his clinical position was<br>advertised and I applied Jim Mann was<br>undertaking a sabbatical at Oxford at<br>the time and I went there to meet him he<br>offered me the job and I Julie accepted<br>it thank you Jim<br>and thank you for your collegiality over<br>the years as an aside David Stewart had<br>a substantial effect on my career not<br>only because it was in vacating his<br>clinical position that led me to Dunedin<br>but also because later in his life he<br>returned to clinical practice in our<br>department it was one of the most astute<br>clinicians I've ever worked with so we<br>packed up and we moved to Dunedin on<br>arriving we were given an old brick<br>house next to to rent next to Walker E<br>Hospital<br>it had hospital mattresses with plastic<br>covers on them it was January and it was<br>psychiatric patients were talking to our<br>children through holes in the fence we<br>questioned our decision to move here and<br>the endocrine department at that time<br>consisted of Jim Nicklaus Barnard and<br>myself I was employed by what was then<br>called the Otago Area Health Board as a<br>full-time clinician which did not have<br>an academic component however soon after<br>I started I had a visit from professor<br>Margaret loud set from the University<br>she came to see if she could assist me<br>with making contacts within the<br>university to initiate research this<br>simple initiative was a turning point<br>and propelled me towards a career in<br>academic medicine from this encounter I<br>met such people as Jean Fleming grant<br>Montgomery and Dave Gretton and then<br>started the endocrinology Research Unit<br>within the department of medicine two<br>researchers were already well<br>established in the department of<br>medicine when I arrived and they both<br>had proven track records they were hours<br>of Gordon who had a strong interest in<br>bone disorders and Wayne Sutherland who<br>was researching in the area of lipid<br>metabolism and it wasn't long before I<br>had cemented strong collaborations with<br>them both my first investigator led<br>clinical trial was looking at the effect<br>of hormone replacement therapy on lipid<br>parameters and postmenopausal woman with<br>diabetes this was at a time when hormone<br>replacement therapy was popular and<br>epidemiological trials had suggested<br>cardiovascular benefit I was successful<br>at gaining an HRC grant the study was<br>successful it suggested improved<br>cardiovascular risk factors in these<br>women and received a quite a bit of<br>attention however probably the most<br>important outcome of this day for me was<br>that I established what would become<br>long-term collaboration with my<br>colleague and friend Wayne Sutherland<br>Wayne has had a huge influence on my<br>research career is the most thorough<br>careful and thoughtful researcher I have<br>ever encountered over the years we've<br>had many in-depth research conversations<br>were often quite lively but always<br>amicable his research talent is only<br>matched by his modesty and his research<br>and his contribution to my research<br>activities has been incalculable and I<br>thank him for them one area that Wayne<br>and I have been particularly interested<br>in has been the immediate effect of the<br>constituents and food on human health<br>particularly we've been interested in<br>whether the ingestion of fat would<br>result in an acute increase in<br>inflammatory markers in the bloodstream<br>Wayne became extremely good at cooking<br>up all sorts of toxic fat containing<br>meals for study participants contrary to<br>what we thought we would find we<br>actually found that after eating<br>inflammation flama tree markers such as<br>interleukin 6 here actually decrease in<br>the hour after eating and this is<br>regardless of the fat content of food<br>this has been a fruitful line of<br>research for us and continues to the<br>present day one theory that we put<br>forward to explain this phenomenon is<br>that insulin the levels of which<br>increase after eating may have an<br>anti-inflammatory effect to test this<br>hypothesis we compared oral versus<br>intravenous glucose on circulating<br>interleukin 6 levels the rationale for<br>this is that glucose taken orally<br>results in a substantially higher level<br>of insulin in the circulation then the<br>same amount taken intravenously this is<br>called the ink return effect in cretons<br>of hormones such as glue to gone like<br>peptide one that are released from the<br>gastrointestinal tract<br>after eating that stimulate insulin<br>secretion in keeping with an<br>anti-inflammatory effect of insulin we<br>found that after oral glucose<br>interleukin 6 levels were substantially<br>however this could be related to a<br>possible anti-inflammatory effect of the<br>increase in hormone glp-1 itself so to<br>test this wayne and i have recently<br>completed a study looking at the effect<br>of intravenous glucagon-like peptide 1<br>versus say line and no effect of grouper<br>gone like peptide one on GLS on IL 6<br>levels was observed which probably means<br>that the acute reduction in aisle 6<br>now one of the benefits of doing<br>clinical work is that interesting<br>clinical situations also lend themselves<br>to research an example of this is a<br>patient that I saw some years ago with<br>thyrotoxicosis this is not an uncommon<br>condition in itself but it transpired<br>that he did not have a usual cause it<br>appeared he had an inflammatory form of<br>thyroiditis it would typically see only<br>about once per year however I then saw<br>three other patients with a similar<br>presentation within the next month or so<br>an unusual feature was that they all<br>lived in the Queens town area are<br>therefore contacted the medical officer<br>of Health and a public health registrar<br>these interviews revealed that all of<br>the patients had one thing in common all<br>consumed the same brand and flavor of<br>soya milk now soy milk is apparently<br>undrinkable without flavoring and one of<br>the means of flavoring it is to add kelp<br>which has a very high iodine content it<br>turned out that these individuals were<br>drinking a brand of soy milk it had been<br>inadvertently made with the incorrect<br>concentration of iodine about ten times<br>the office upper safe level for human<br>consumption as a result that developed<br>iodine and juice thyrotoxicosis<br>pleasingly they all recovered and even<br>better they all received handsome<br>another fruitful area of research that<br>Wayne and I have been interested in<br>along with Rob Walker and Sheila<br>Williams to other superb researchers<br>that I've been lucky enough to<br>collaborate with over the years has been<br>the effect of antioxidant treatment on<br>obesity induced insulin resistance has<br>been a great deal of controversy<br>concerning this area of research our<br>initial study was a randomized<br>controlled trial of vitamin E versus<br>placebo in a tea overweight individuals<br>interesting the markers of oxidative<br>stress were significantly decreased than<br>those that were taking vitamin E<br>compared to those taking placebo and<br>insulin resistance also transiently<br>improved excited by these findings we<br>undertook a larger study of combined<br>antioxidant treatment with both lipoic<br>acid and vitamin E in 160 overweight<br>individuals with the metabolic syndrome<br>unfortunately no beneficial effect was<br>identified and this is one of the<br>difficulties with clinical trial Reese<br>a huge amount of time and effort goes<br>into these studies and one waits with<br>fingers crossed for several years for an<br>answer however this study has<br>definitively discounted antioxidant<br>therapy as a useful preventative<br>treatment and people at risk of type 2<br>diabetes along the way I have<br>participated in a number of large<br>international multicenter clinical<br>trials in areas such as diabetes<br>osteoporosis and obesity and these<br>studies have resulted in important<br>findings that have altered clinical<br>practice I'm indebted to n riles and Liz<br>berry to outstanding research nurses who<br>have worked alongside me in the<br>endocrine Research Unit for nearly 20<br>collaborations with other researchers<br>have played an important aspect of my<br>research activities as well and I'll<br>highlight this with two examples a<br>particularly interesting and enjoyable<br>collaboration that I've had is with<br>Rajesh katar of the department of<br>physiology a very intelligent and<br>personable researcher this arose<br>originally from Rajesh wanting to<br>explore changes in micro RNAs and people<br>with type 2 diabetes and especially<br>their role and diabetes related heart<br>disease micro rna's are small non-coding<br>RNA molecules that are important and<br>regulating gene expression this has led<br>to some very interesting findings and<br>excellent publications<br>however the establishment of this<br>collaboration also resulted in us<br>looking into changes in micro rna's in<br>obesity and how they change with weight<br>loss without going into too much detail<br>certain micro RNAs related to beta cell<br>mass apoptosis angiogenesis and<br>inflammation are dysregulated and<br>obesity and many improved quite<br>dramatically with weight loss<br>just to point out a few examples we can<br>see how those related to inflammation<br>are significantly elevated and obese<br>individuals compared to lean but with<br>weight loss these levels return almost<br>to normal the same scene with micro RNA<br>another collaboration there has been<br>particularly exciting and successful has<br>been that with dirk de Ridder<br>this was somewhat serendipitous I was<br>undertaking a sabbatical and Antwerp at<br>the time that Dirk was about to move to<br>Dunedin to take up the chair of<br>neurosurgery I had started a clinical<br>trial of a drug that I hope may be<br>useful at preventing weight regain in<br>people with obesity that had lost weight<br>using a very low calorie diet the<br>medication was cabergoline a d2 receptor<br>agonist that we use for treating<br>patients with prolactin OMERS and had<br>noted that and these people weight loss<br>is often a side effect<br>unfortunately this again turned out to<br>be a negative trial after discussion<br>with Dirk however we designed a sub<br>study of the cabergoline study whereby<br>we would investigate the effect of<br>obesity and subsequent weight loss on<br>brain activity using quantitative<br>electroencephalography or QED EEG out of<br>this has grown a small research team of<br>dirk myself paul glue wayne sutherland<br>samantha ross and suckling leon which<br>has been very active and productive over<br>the past few years not only here we<br>investigate sad brain imaging in obesity<br>but looked at other disorders such as<br>alcoholism and anorexia we've also<br>investigated how neuromodulation of<br>specific areas of the brain might impact<br>these disorders Samantha's PhD was<br>concentrated on changes in<br>brain activity and obesity using cue EEG<br>she showed that women that are obese<br>have differences in brain activity in<br>certain areas compete compared to lean<br>women these areas of the brain are those<br>that have a role to play in salience or<br>importance of stimuli in the environment<br>it appears that obese individuals have<br>an inability to suppress the salience of<br>food which will likely lit result in the<br>meeting more than their metabolic<br>requirements over time this will lead to<br>obesity interestingly and Samantha's<br>group of participants weight-loss did<br>not reverse these abnormalities the fact<br>these changes persist may be one of the<br>reasons why people who lose weight are<br>highly prone to regaining their lost<br>weight and it raises the question as to<br>whether there is any way to somehow<br>revert the activity of these regions<br>back to normal in order to reduce food<br>and take this is where suckling liang's<br>work comes and she's completed two<br>studies using neuromodulation techniques<br>to look at the effect on food craving in<br>the first study she used what's called<br>high definition transcranial pink noise<br>stimulation targeted at the anterior<br>cingulate cortex in the obese in obese<br>woman with evidence of food addiction<br>and she found that this intervention<br>inhibits intense desire to eat in this<br>group of individuals her next study used<br>infrasonic of the default mode network<br>the default mode network consists of<br>brain regions that work together to<br>provide a self-referential function in<br>the brain the posterior cingulate cortex<br>is the main hub of the default mode<br>network and it receives information from<br>other brain regions predominantly as<br>low wave frequency it's been postulated<br>that the default mode Network has reset<br>an obesity to be functioning abnormally<br>the aim of this study was to look at<br>modulating slow wave activity in the<br>posterior cingulate cortex using<br>neurofeedback<br>this is a completely novel form of<br>treatment and indeed was successful at<br>reducing food craving in obese<br>individuals there's an area we hope to<br>undertake further research with larger<br>groups in the future we've also examined<br>the effect of implanting electrodes in<br>the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex of<br>the brain and people with intractable<br>alcoholism this has proved to be<br>extremely effective for a subgroup of<br>people with alcohol addiction now<br>throughout my time I've had the pleasure<br>of working with a number of medical<br>students who have wanted to dip their<br>toes into clinical research such as Anna<br>Choi who looked at the different at<br>different thyroxine treatment strategies<br>for hypothyroidism and Helen Slade who<br>studied the impact of a combined<br>diabetes and nephrology clinic for<br>patients with diabetic nephropathy<br>they've also been many who have been<br>involved in writing case reports one<br>interesting case report involved a<br>patient that had had multiple admissions<br>to the intensive care unit with the<br>curious presentation of severe<br>hypotension and associated requiring<br>inotropic support and associated severe<br>peripheral edema I was called to see her<br>to offer an opinion as to whether she<br>may have adrenal insufficiency to<br>explain her symptoms that was quickly<br>excluded but on further investigation of<br>the case I ventured a diagnosis of the<br>rare condition of capillary leak<br>syndrome it turned out that this is what<br>she had<br>however it also transpired that this<br>diagnosis had been previously<br>entertained but excluded because it had<br>been made by the final year medical<br>student on the intensive care unit a<br>good example of listening to all members<br>of the medical team regardless of their<br>status this case report was written up<br>by two of my children studying medicine<br>when it came to teaching medical<br>students I had always felt like they did<br>not always receive the best teaching<br>experience when attending our outpatient<br>clinics it was a hit-and-miss experience<br>and depended on which patients were<br>coming to the clinic on that particular<br>day so from early on we started teaching<br>clinics and which selected patients were<br>invited into the outpatient clinic for<br>the particular purpose of teaching<br>students these patients were hand-picked<br>so that they Illustrated the disease<br>states that we felt were important for<br>the students to experience it also meant<br>that the specialists who were teaching<br>at the clinic did not have to provide<br>medical care they could fully<br>concentrate on simply teaching this was<br>very well received by the students and<br>the patient's also enjoyed the<br>experience of giving something back to<br>the medical profession when it came to<br>review the medical curriculum for the<br>fourth and fifth year medical students I<br>propose that this type of teaching be<br>implemented across the Medical<br>Specialties<br>and so became the ambulatory medicine<br>course every medical specialty now<br>provides the component of their teaching<br>in this manner along with the course<br>coordinator<br>there's letter we looked into the<br>effectiveness of this mode of teaching<br>and we found that the ambulatory<br>medicine program was an effective way of<br>developing medical students clinical<br>skills by providing focused teaching<br>with real patients in a dedicated<br>environment of course it has not been<br>all plain sailing<br>I will never forget arriving back from<br>holiday in early January 2000 to receive<br>a message on the answerphone that a<br>patient I had been involved in the Kirov<br>had died unexpectedly the patient was<br>the wife of a colleague her name was<br>Annie at Bauer I don't need to detail<br>the case as it was played out in the<br>newspaper television and also a film<br>suffice to say that her husband who was<br>a psychiatrist at the neden Hospital was<br>found guilty of her murder using drugs<br>in a way that would mimic her having an<br>insulin-producing pancreatic tumor the<br>death of the wife of a colleague and<br>subsequently learning that it was at the<br>hands of that colleague was particularly<br>devastating the two-year period waiting<br>for and then participating in the court<br>trial was stressful and I particularly<br>want to thank my family and friends who<br>helped me during that time in the<br>original court case it was alleged by<br>the defense team that dr. Bauer was<br>innocent and that his wife had become<br>depressed as a result of an extremely<br>rare condition called beta cell<br>hyperplasia which produces hypoglycemia<br>and had committed suicide by taking<br>drugs that happened to mimic that<br>condition however in 2015 he changed his<br>stance to indicate that it was assisted<br>suicide and that he would be applying to<br>the Privy Council for a retrial he<br>claimed that his wife had had an<br>undiagnosed mysterious medical illness<br>and was refusing to seek medical<br>attention and so to enforce her<br>hospitalization for investigation<br>he surreptitiously administered drugs to<br>her<br>that would produce hypoglycemia he then<br>claimed there because the hospital<br>doctors failed to diagnose the<br>mysterious illness which he claimed to<br>be the rare neurological condition of<br>myasthenia gravis due to a prior pact he<br>had with his wife he assisted her<br>suicide by administering her insulin the<br>application to the Privy Council never<br>eventuated but at the time of his<br>deportation back to South Africa<br>dr. Bao maintained his position of<br>assistant suicide in my view however an<br>application to the Privy Council would<br>not have been successful because there<br>is compelling evidence that the defense<br>team have overlooked they would make the<br>I've also had other unusual patient<br>encounters during my career one day a<br>police woman came to see me with a<br>letter that I had apparently written to<br>a patient concerning information<br>requested by the probation service I<br>read the letter and several things stood<br>out first of all it was to a patient<br>that I'd seen some years previously but<br>concerned a medical condition that I<br>don't deal with lymphoma a type of<br>cancer secondly it was not my signature<br>and thirdly the letter contained<br>language that was unlike that which I<br>generally use for example it says I<br>would not be doing you or your family do<br>justice if I was to sugarcoat things the<br>next few months may see a marked<br>improvement in your short-term health<br>unfortunately this will only be a short<br>reprieve my advice to you is to use this<br>time to get things sorted don't give up<br>hope but make preparations<br>I hope this is enough clarification for<br>those who need it make the most of this<br>Christmas it transpired that the patient<br>had written the letter himself as a way<br>of getting out of doing periodic<br>detention ironically and resulted in<br>them being locked up the other bizarre<br>situation that I was involved in was<br>that of a young man with a pituitary<br>disorder who blamed his lack of male<br>genital development on my supposed<br>inadequate treatment of his testosterone<br>deficiency my secretary received a phone<br>call from Christchurch hospital<br>emergency department to say that the<br>patient had taken himself there for<br>urgent treatment of this problem he was<br>told by the medical staff that this<br>wasn't exactly an emergency as such and<br>that his hormonal treatment was<br>appropriate the disgruntled patient had<br>walked out informing the staff that he<br>was going to drive back down to Dunedin<br>and shoot dr. Manning the fact that I'm<br>here talking to you today suggests that<br>he was unsuccessful but it did place us<br>on high alert in the department for<br>several days so what is the role of the<br>clinical academic and as the position<br>still relevant clearly they have a role<br>and teaching students probably the most<br>important teaching that a medical<br>student receives is that which takes<br>place at the bedside or in the clinic<br>with real patients it is seen as a duty<br>of all doctors to pass on what they know<br>to those coming after them unfortunately<br>in today's high throughput clinical<br>environment the ability to provide<br>quality teaching to students has been<br>eroded both because clinicians are too<br>busy<br>and patients have a very short length of<br>stay this will be even more challenging<br>in the future as patients patient care<br>moves into other sites such as short<br>stay wards and the patient's home the<br>protected teaching time that clinical<br>academics and joy enables them to<br>deliver quality teaching and to develop<br>innovative teaching situations like<br>ambulatory teaching clinics the other<br>role of the academic clinical academic<br>is to help focus research on important<br>clinical problems that we face today and<br>looking into the future the clinician is<br>in a unique position to see where the<br>gaps are in health care knowledge and<br>practice the research questions they<br>pose are therefore usually important<br>they can also play an important role in<br>assisting basic scientists translate<br>their research into the clinical<br>environment I believe the greater<br>interaction between basic scientists and<br>clinical academics is an untapped<br>potential here in Dunedin for certain<br>research funding bodies such as the<br>Health Research Council there has been a<br>shift in funding priorities recently to<br>be successful an applicant now needs to<br>be able to demonstrate the health impact<br>of their research if it was likely that<br>the development of research teams that<br>consists of both basic scientists and<br>clinical academics will become even more<br>important into the future so the<br>question is how we can attract our<br>future clinicians to consider an<br>academic career rather than purely a<br>clinical one they are not going to be<br>attracted by the salary so they have to<br>be other reasons a few thoughts come to<br>mind<br>exposure to role models as important as<br>previously mentioned this is what<br>attracted me to this career medical<br>students and junior doctors need to see<br>what clinical academics do so they can<br>make an<br>form decision about their career pathway<br>junior doctors should be taught how to<br>be clinical teachers and encouraged to<br>actively participate in the teaching of<br>medical students they should also be<br>taught the basics of medical research<br>and provided with opportunities to join<br>established research teams the<br>university can also play a role by<br>facilitating connections between<br>clinicians and basic scientists it will<br>also be vital that the university has a<br>strong voice when it comes to shaping<br>the configuration of the new Dunedin<br>hospital making sure that it retains its<br>teaching hospital reputation and<br>ensuring that there are appropriate<br>research and teaching facilities<br>available so one of the best aspects of<br>my work as the people who I work with<br>day to day the endocrinology department<br>it has always been a very happy place<br>with people who all look after and look<br>out for each other in fact we were<br>visited by someone from senior<br>management who wanted to find out why we<br>were so happy at work I'm still not sure<br>if they wanted to find out the secret so<br>that it could be spread around the<br>hospital or they wanted to put an end to<br>it<br>so to all my co-workers I'd like to<br>thank you for making our work<br>environment so pleasurable throughout<br>this talk I've mentioned some of the<br>important people who have influenced my<br>career and I think then once again for<br>their collegiality and support however<br>there are many more that I have not had<br>time to mention but they know who they<br>are and I also think them I'd also like<br>to thank the medical students who<br>constantly challenged our way of<br>thinking and keep us from becoming too<br>cynical I'd like to take this<br>opportunity also to thank my friends<br>outside of Medicine for keeping me sane<br>they may think that is debatable<br>of course my greatest thanks goes to my<br>immediate family our three amazing<br>children Annie<br>Tom and Jack of whom I am extremely<br>proud but most of all to my wife Deb who<br>has put up with me for over 30 years she<br>supported me guided me and enabled me to<br>follow my own career probably at the<br>expense of her own<br>despite this my accomplishments pale in<br>comparison to what she has achieved<br>finally I think the University of Otago<br>for a support of me in providing me with<br>the freedom to follow my own academic<br>interests thank you<br>good evening my name's Rachel Taylor I'm<br>the deputy head of department of<br>medicine and it's my job on behalf of<br>Michael Schultz who was enabled to be<br>here tonight to congratulate Patrick on<br>his promotion to clinical professor but<br>also to thank him to what I'm sure<br>you'll agree was a highly entertaining<br>tour de force through his life as a<br>clinical academic or academic clinician<br>and he would argue as we heard for the<br>former which i think is important and I<br>think Patrick's taught talk highlighted<br>beautifully the real importance and<br>strength of us having these academic<br>clinicians and the the wealth of<br>information in expertise and value they<br>add to our department of medicine<br>clearly but also to the wider University<br>Patrick's always been an incredibly<br>productive member of department and I<br>think a little bit of that comes through<br>has talked but it clearly under plays<br>the massive role he's had both and<br>teaching and research and and service as<br>well so on behalf of the University of<br>again thank you<br>sorry congratulations well done</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
