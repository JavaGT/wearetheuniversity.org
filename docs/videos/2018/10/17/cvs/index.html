font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I think to begin with with CBS going to<br>the Career Service at the University is<br>a really good place to start they can<br>advise you on best practice what a good<br>CV looks like and they'll also be able<br>to give you a template so you can begin<br>to fill in the different sections rather<br>than starting from scratch with a blank<br>page which can be pretty daunting so the<br>best way to prepare your CV is to decide<br>on a format make sure it's structured<br>keep it concise you don't need to go<br>over to pages and remember that you're<br>applying for a graduate role so keep<br>your education and your skills at the<br>top of your CV to prepare for a CV I<br>would start with research I would look<br>at the company that you are applying for<br>the role that you're interested in this<br>allows you to figure out whether the<br>company is actually right for you and<br>whether the role at staff is also<br>something that you are truly interested<br>in doing also understanding your target<br>audit audience so if you are going for a<br>creative industry or a corporate<br>industry you can tailor your CV<br>appropriately I would recommend trying<br>to write your CV from somebody else's<br>perspective talking about yourself if<br>you're uncomfortable talking about what<br>you did or saying I am this person and I<br>have this experience trying to be as<br>objective as possible and talk about<br>yourself as another person and you can<br>always change the pronouns later<br>your CV should be approximately two<br>pages long if it's too short you might<br>be lacking detail if it's too long it<br>kind of makes us big the question is all<br>of this relevant it's also very<br>overwhelming when at main Freight we<br>received thousands of CDs a year so we<br>want to be able to look at your CV and<br>kind of get a snapshot of you without<br>having to go to and dips and read<br>between the lines really ity you have to<br>appreciate that we have over two and a<br>half thousand applications per year so<br>we like to see about two pages worth of<br>information on your CV so being<br>succinctly also providing the detail in<br>context that we need to really<br>understand who you are so it's a really<br>key thing to get your CV the right links<br>somewhere between one to two pages is<br>kind of ideal if you're trying to<br>squeeze it all into one that might look<br>a bit cluttered and really hard to read<br>but those kind of a good size especially<br>at the graduate level we don't expect to<br>earn service from from students to be<br>any longer than two pages I've<br>definitely seen some longer ones and I<br>think it's important to keep it really<br>clear concise and with all the relevant<br>information so no more than two pages<br>maximum being about three<br>at the beginning of a student's CV I<br>really like to see a short personal<br>statement just to capture in a snapshot<br>who you are your experiences from each<br>of the different areas of your life and<br>then also finally what you're looking<br>for in a role and in a company so yeah<br>that's an important part to me so<br>personal statement career objective a I<br>think with anything that really does<br>come down to you but it's something you<br>need to keep up-to-date and make sure<br>that it still aligns with what you're<br>looking to do with your career you're<br>looking for aligns with what the company<br>you're applying to can give you if<br>you're applying to be engineer at an<br>accounting firm and that's in your<br>objective you're probably not going to<br>get far along the process so we don't<br>ask that you include a personal<br>statement or a career objective on your<br>CV and this is kind of a case-by-case<br>and it's more and whether you feel that<br>that's relevant on your CV and so for<br>example if you know exactly where you<br>want to be in three to five years time<br>and you've got a really clear vision of<br>how to get there then it's really good<br>to put that on and also sometimes a<br>personal summary can be good to get a<br>feel for that person's personality and<br>but again it's not and it's not a<br>prerequisite for us I think your<br>personal statement should rather be<br>included in your cover letter your cover<br>letter in your CV are two separate<br>documents your CV should be focusing on<br>the facts so again your work experiences<br>and educational history<br>no definitely not and we don't ask for a<br>specific skill section on a CV and the<br>reason is we would rather see how you<br>apply those skills so be that through<br>your application questions or how you<br>represent that through a cover letter<br>and we would rather see that<br>incorporated rather than kind of a list<br>of bullet points and their skills I<br>would suggest a technical skill section<br>so if you are studying a degree in<br>computer science or information systems<br>it's really important to list those<br>skills so whether it's the type of<br>languages you've studied coding systems<br>databases definitely but please don't<br>include a personal attributes or<br>competency-based list rather try and<br>incorporate those competencies in the<br>body of your work experience so for<br>example if you think you're a<br>problem-solver tell us about how you<br>solve the problem at work what impact it<br>might have had on the business and your<br>role yes so it's important to remember<br>that an interviewer sometimes will only<br>review your CV in about five to seven<br>seconds so you want to keep your CV very<br>structured absolutely if you've got<br>technical skills list them separately<br>from your soft skills I think a foot<br>skill section if done well can help you<br>stand out from the crowd<br>Deloitte get about 3,000 graduate<br>applications during the graduate period<br>so you need to be able to stand out but<br>make sure their skills that do make you<br>stand out so if you have a special skill<br>and a technology or something that's<br>different to just your run-of-the-mill<br>attention to detail and communication I<br>think bullet point you know to sort of<br>three or four of your top skills are<br>good to kind of draw the eye the<br>recruiter and go okay this person's got<br>something we'd like and we want to<br>pursue through that each CV is different<br>but a few have skills that are relevant<br>to the role definitely put it in there<br>so for example if you had a forklift<br>license and very good numerical skills<br>and I would definitely put that on your<br>CV for us it would highlight that you<br>might be a good candidate for our<br>logistics division but make sure that<br>they are backed up for the examples<br>otherwise<br>it just kind of looks like you're<br>putting it on there for the sake of<br>putting it on there in terms of the<br>layout of the CV I prefer to see things<br>in chronological order or in different<br>sections according to your voluntary<br>experience your education and your work<br>experience a skill section isn't<br>necessarily important to me I like to<br>see them woven into the different areas<br>of your life that you're talking about<br>however if you're more comfortable and<br>breaking that out separately and that's<br>up to you you have creative control on<br>this one so in terms of listing you<br>referees if it's someone that's<br>potentially known to the business and<br>would be somebody that the business<br>would respect and that feels then<br>absolutely because that could be the<br>reason you get through to an interview<br>otherwise there's no requirement to do<br>so Deloitte wouldn't contact your<br>references until you'd actually been<br>offered the role and at that time<br>because you need to make sure your<br>referees are happy to be a referee for<br>you so we'd ask you to check with them<br>and then we'd make contact and it's<br>definitely not necessary to list your<br>referees on a CV in KPMG's process we<br>and would contact you later on down the<br>line if we do need those details you<br>don't need to list your referees just<br>my top three tips with CVS would be to<br>begin with the Career Service there's no<br>point struggling on your own when<br>they're the experts so go get some<br>advice from them go and get a template<br>from them and start there secondly I<br>would advise it include hard facts in<br>your CV that focus on the results of<br>what you've achieved say for example if<br>you have bullet points under each of<br>your work experiences of voluntary<br>experiences I want you to list what you<br>did how you did it and why you did it so<br>the why is the result and that's the<br>part that students often miss out we're<br>looking for the impact that you<br>personally delivered so we can imagine<br>the impact that you're going to be able<br>to deliver in a role with us finally I<br>think you should be quite quantitive and<br>the the results that you give so really<br>bring to life the story that you're<br>trying to tell so talk to me about the<br>percentage cost savings that you<br>delivered or how much money you raised<br>for your voluntary charity work we like<br>to see stories with detail and that will<br>set you apart from other students we see<br>two and a half thousand during our<br>campaign so go into the detail and give<br>us facts and figures that we can use to<br>really remember you and understand you<br>with so three of the things for a<br>successful CV and so one thing for me<br>personally is I think it's really<br>important when you are applying for a<br>graduate or an intern position to put<br>your education and as further up on the<br>front of your CV as you can because it's<br>really clear for a recruiter then to see<br>you know who you are what you're<br>studying things like that<br>and I would definitely also recommend<br>and put in as much detail in there about<br>work experience voluntary<br>extracurriculars clubs societies<br>anything you've been involved in an OD<br>at all detail is good so there's no<br>detail that will be detrimental to your<br>CV we like to see your hobbies and your<br>interests so this kind of gives us a<br>little bit more understanding about who<br>you are and what you like to get up to<br>outside of work or what you like to get<br>outside of University I would definitely<br>get somebody to look over your CV so<br>proofreading is really<br>really critical grammar and spelling as<br>a critical part of CV writing as well as<br>that you could look at making your CV<br>format PDF so once you are sending in<br>your application you might find that the<br>format changes once you send it through<br>to someone else's computer so PDF<br>formats<br>quite good so the most most important<br>thing when you're creating your CV is to<br>keep the format neat and tidy keep the<br>information concise and factual one of<br>those things and I come across it quite<br>often is when individuals say that they<br>are very detail orientated or have a<br>strong eye for detail but yet I come<br>across numerous spelling and grammar<br>mistakes so please ensure you use spell<br>check and proofread your CV before you<br>sending it out I think other things to<br>consider when you're doing a CV and<br>Christiane that actually you often get<br>asked is about whether to include a<br>photo I personally recommend not to<br>include a photo<br>I think it's unnecessary for your skills<br>if you do decide to use a photo make<br>sure that it's appropriate to the<br>company that you're applying for that<br>it's not too casual and that you're<br>smartly dressed within it a photo should<br>be about a huge shot of something that<br>you would look like if you were to turn<br>up for an interview however it's a lot<br>easier not to have a photo and<br>everyone's got LinkedIn these days so<br>that's a good shortcut I think something<br>else to consider with your CV and is<br>very important is spell checking if you<br>need to get someone to read over your CV<br>and double triple check that everything<br>is in line especially if you're going to<br>describe yourself as an accurate person<br>don't misspell the word accurate it's<br>never a good look and if you've been<br>working it's always really helpful to<br>see if that's been part-time or<br>full-time work or if it was over the<br>holidays sometimes it looks like you've<br>been holding a full-time job down while<br>you've been studying two or three<br>different degrees and it's really<br>confusing one of the things that I think<br>can trip people up on the CV is having a<br>photo once again it's your decision<br>whether you do so but if you're going to<br>have one don't make it a selfie in front<br>of the bathroom mirror make it a<br>professional shot the reason I don't<br>personally think<br>photos are good on CVS is that whoever's<br>reviewing it without even thinking about<br>it might have already judged you before<br>they even had a chance to look at what<br>you can bring to the role this and the<br>sense of unconscious bias so my<br>recommendation is no but once again it's<br>your CVS and you decide whether you want<br>to do that or not one other tip that and<br>for your CV and it sounds really silly<br>but just make sure your contact details<br>are really easy to spot we're going<br>through you the recruiter needs to get<br>three things pretty quickly so they need<br>to go to contact you so make sure those<br>are really clear on your CV first inform<br>us please proofread it if you say in<br>your school section that you've got<br>great attention to detail but then we<br>come down and we see spelling mistakes<br>or punctuation errors it kind of doesn't<br>really match up so you could write you<br>could get your family and friends to<br>proofread it for you if you didn't feel<br>you know confident and and that<br>formatting is really important so if we<br>see a CV that's well formatted it will<br>immediately put us into a more positive<br>frame of mind because it's easy to read<br>that's clear and well-structured and<br>thirdly put in your personality because<br>we do get so many CVS across our desks<br>every day if you can put your<br>personality in there it will help you<br>stand out from everyone else so for<br>example we had one candidate put on her<br>CV that she plays kayak polo and<br>immediately we were like what what is<br>that we've never heard of it before so<br>you know we were immediately intrigued<br>and wanted to get her and to see what it<br>was how much involvement she had with it<br>and and why she went there in the first<br>place<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
