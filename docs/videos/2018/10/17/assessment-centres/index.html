tips on attending assessment centres.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the assessment is very similar no matter<br>which of our offices that you attend it<br>at and it has three main parts to it so<br>first of all you will be involved in a<br>group exercise involving some sort of<br>case study working with other students<br>at the Assessment Center then you'll<br>have your one-hour interview normally<br>with one of our partners in the area of<br>the business that you're applying to and<br>then finally you will have a tour of the<br>office and a networking session to<br>really get to know our people generally<br>you'll be placing in the team and<br>working towards a solution for a<br>particular challenge at the end of the<br>day generally you'll present your<br>solution with your team and at some<br>stage during the day you'll also see it<br>I'd say first and foremost make sure you<br>get a lot of sleep yeah I think I think<br>sleep is pretty important for the next<br>day we get a lot of people that are<br>quite tired because they've been up<br>stressing so the second thing would be<br>try not to be too nervous nobody really<br>knows what's going to happen next<br>nobody actually knows what's going to<br>happen at all and everyone's in the same<br>boat but it's it's a lot better and it's<br>more fun for everyone if you can kind of<br>relax and just enjoy things as they<br>happen and unravel beyond that you could<br>probably research the company you need<br>to know exactly what the company does<br>and who they are when you turn up it's<br>all about interviewing for that company<br>when we have technical interviews if you<br>could prepare for those just make sure<br>you know and you're ready to kind of<br>code and answer some technical questions<br>but other than that yeah get some sleep<br>eat well relax turn up smile and just<br>try and have a really good time the best<br>way to prepare for an assessment center<br>is research research the company be<br>confident talking about why you want to<br>join the company and what makes you the<br>best fit review your CV make sure you're<br>confident talking about your strengths<br>and the skills that you've listed in<br>your CV and also create your elevator<br>pitch be able to introduce yourself in a<br>couple of sentences because obviously<br>you going to be interacting with a lot<br>of new people throughout the day we<br>actually say there's nothing to prepare<br>fully and we try and say get a good<br>night's sleep the night before and but<br>it's always good to think about case<br>studies and to read any practice case<br>studies that you can online familiarize<br>yourself with the terminology the<br>language and just try and be you know be<br>the best version of yourself and try and<br>you know not be late and all those kinds<br>of things and I think it's a good time<br>to prepare some questions for the<br>one-on-one partner interview as well so<br>when you speak to the partner and bring<br>some questions along to try and get a<br>feel for KPMG<br>and I guess be authentic is one of the<br>big things for us so we want you to be<br>the best version of yourself across the<br>whole application process so when you do<br>come to the assessment day we want you<br>to be the same version of yourself that<br>you have been throughout the whole<br>process so be genuine be honest and if<br>you're unsure in doubt about anything<br>you know be a little bit more reserved<br>and but also if you feeling confident<br>you know feel free to speak up and ask<br>questions and things like that so yeah<br>standing out as I'd say would be for<br>yourself and ask as many questions as<br>you can<br>so the the dress attire for assessment<br>days should be provided by the recruiter<br>if it's not it's fairly safe to assume<br>that you should dress professionally<br>first impressions count so you want to<br>look presentable and professional in<br>terms of dress for the assessment center<br>we just recommend that you come in<br>business attire but something<br>comfortable we don't want you to be<br>fidgeting or too hot or too cold so just<br>take the lead from the Career Service if<br>you're not sure go and talk to them<br>about what's appropriate when it comes<br>to wardrobe general advice is dress with<br>the job that you're going for it and if<br>you're going for a company that has a<br>pretty corporate culture make sure that<br>you dress appropriately for that at zero<br>wear whatever you want we a t-shirt and<br>jeans company we issue t-shirt to the<br>pre year can we are exactly what makes<br>you feel comfortable and if that's a<br>suit been wear a suit but if it's tidy<br>t-shirt and jeans wear a tidy t-shirt in<br>James it doesn't matter or in a smile<br>making sure you wear a smile<br>again it depends seishun otoko<br>healthcare we don't we're so or Thai so<br>I would definitely ask the person that's<br>organized the assessment center as to<br>what's appropriate you also want to be<br>comfortable so with these activities you<br>might be moving around a lot so you do<br>think my top three tips would be first<br>of all come prepared<br>I'm definitely be as calm and relaxed as<br>you can because we want you to as I said<br>before be as authentic as possible and<br>as genuine as possible so we can see the<br>best of you and your strengths secondly<br>I would really recommend that you be as<br>collaborative as possible on the day<br>either in the team exercise or going<br>outside of your comfort zone to talk to<br>different people in the networking<br>section that way we can really see all<br>of your skills and abilities to network<br>and it gives you the opportunity to show<br>off I suppose to lots of different<br>people who will be involved in the<br>decision-making process thirdly I would<br>say again to know yourself know why<br>you're applying to ey know why you're<br>applying to that part of the business<br>why you want that role and maybe even<br>why in that certain location because<br>often the partners are very passionate<br>about the clients that they work with in<br>the city so know yourself and know what<br>you're applying for communicate so try<br>and have fun try and make friends and<br>it's really good to see when a group of<br>people who haven't known it met before<br>and meet an assessment day and then<br>become fast friends and you know we've<br>had examples where they've gone out to<br>for dinner afterwards together and<br>they've followed up with each other<br>afterwards it's really nice to see that<br>cohesion and to see them communicate and<br>make friends yeah important things to<br>remember with assessment days you don't<br>have to be the loudest person on the<br>team utilize the brakes make sure you're<br>introducing yourself to people<br>networking it's really important and as<br>well the challenge on the date isn't<br>necessarily the most important aspect of<br>the day so rather than spending your<br>time preparing for the case study that<br>you may do spend your time reviewing<br>your CV and being confident talking<br>about yourself think about how your<br>actor interacting with your team<br>mates and obviously asked lots of<br>questions I think it's really important<br>and assessments in the to listen really<br>carefully to the instructions that way<br>if you you're not unsure with the<br>activities that you can ask specific<br>questions relating to them and and be<br>more comfortable<br>I suppose if there was anything else<br>that you should probably remember when<br>it comes to an assessment centre the<br>first one would have to be assume you're<br>being assessed at all times<br>treat the entire day like an assessment<br>sometimes the things that don't actually<br>seem like a challenge actually are so<br>that would be tip number one I think tip<br>number two it's not I said earlier that<br>you should be yourself and it's okay to<br>not be right for our company but I would<br>say it's not just okay to be yourself<br>the best the best people are always<br>themselves and that's a lot easier at a<br>higher for we can see that quite quickly<br>and then I would say probably the third<br>thing to really mail in an assessment<br>day is just have an open mind and a<br>positive attitude to pretty much<br>everything you come across if you can<br>smile through something that you're<br>nervous it or if you can smell it<br>something you're not necessarily strong<br>at we're going to notice that as well<br>and that's that's equally as important<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
