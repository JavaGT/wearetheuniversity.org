0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so PwC conduct both a numerical and<br>verbal reasoning assessment and these<br>tests are there to assess how you think<br>in terms of preparation for these<br>assessments there are quite a few<br>practice tests that you can find online<br>so it might be a good idea to to run<br>through those and try and complete them<br>within the time frame so preparing for<br>psychometric testing questions the ones<br>that are used predominantly a quiet you<br>can find kind of example questions and<br>practice questions online so I<br>definitely recommend just googling those<br>and getting used to the style and the<br>way that they ask the questions and<br>prepare yourself for them to be timed<br>potentially as well so get used to<br>answering those pressure those questions<br>under a little bit of time pressure<br>so with psychometric tests you need to<br>understand what's being tested first of<br>all so speak to the Graduate employer<br>who sent you the testing just to clarify<br>what's expected of you<br>I see where we have two different tests<br>so the first is situational judgment<br>this is around the fit to the culture<br>the fit to the business environment so<br>we will ask you or posed a situation to<br>you and then you'll have an a B C or D<br>answer and you have to pick the one that<br>you would be most likely to pursue the<br>option that's most probable that you<br>choose and there's no right or wrong<br>answer here we're just looking to see do<br>you fit into the culture do you have the<br>same values that we have at UI following<br>that you'll be asked to sit a verbal<br>numerical and diagrammatic ability test<br>again there's lots of these on the<br>internet that you can go away in<br>practice or you can go to your Career<br>Service and they will have links to<br>practice papers or perhaps some hard<br>copies for you to do then also be able<br>to provide some advice on your style and<br>how you should approach them so you<br>can't really practice a situational<br>judgment because that's your personality<br>you've been practicing that your whole<br>life but you can practice the abilities<br>tests and I would really recommend that<br>you do<br>because they're very time-pressured and<br>it can be quite stressful so you have<br>practice makes perfect so psychometric<br>testing you're not going to know what<br>those questions are but it's important<br>to ask the questions of the HR person or<br>whoever's sending you through the test a<br>little bit more about what to expect you<br>can actually go online and find some<br>some example questions that you could<br>put yourself through just so that you're<br>yeah so speedo at cr√©cy it really does<br>depend on what sort of test so we didn't<br>really say try and answer as many<br>questions as you can<br>accurately but it's a bit of a balancing<br>act at the end of the day depends on the<br>teeth there's no right or wrong answers<br>were some of them so it's really<br>important to take your time and<br>answering them best that you can<br>so aptitude test these definitely right<br>or wrong answers with those but<br>personality test there's no right or<br>wrong answers and generally with<br>personality to see and are not timed so<br>you're not having to think about that<br>speed<br>a Pathmark is very relative so some<br>companies will progress the top 50% of<br>highest scores and they will filter out<br>or reject the bottom 50% all the<br>companies don't do this at all they just<br>have the scores as part of the<br>decision-making process but there isn't<br>a hard or fast pass or fail mark so<br>again it really depends on the employer<br>it depends on the type of employer<br>regarding and their process regarding<br>how important the testicles are so again<br>some employers will say the bottom 25%<br>of testicles will be rejected<br>immediately before you even get to<br>interview stage others will make<br>everybody set the tests who applies and<br>then when the business sits down at the<br>end of the process they will take the<br>test into consideration but they won't<br>screen out based on them so some<br>employers you have to pass the test<br>otherwise you won't get to the end of<br>the process and be successful other<br>employers will allow you to fail the<br>tests for want of a better expression<br>compared with the candidates but you<br>might still have the offer if you stand<br>out in other areas so again it really<br>depends which isn't helpful but you just<br>have to do your best so in accounts the<br>overall selection process we do put a<br>lot of weight on the results of your<br>assessments in terms of the overall<br>selection process the test is just one<br>part of it in these different weightings<br>given Tyvek test depending on which<br>service line that you're actually<br>interviewing with but from my experience<br>the service lines<br>want to meet people so they do they do<br>use them but actually meeting people and<br>really get engaged who they are as a<br>person probably has more weight than the<br>tests a psychometric testing is works<br>alongside the traditional methods so<br>it's all in partnership but it's not<br>just the the last part of the process<br>and the final decision-making it's<br>all-encompassing so it's the<br>psychometric test as the interviewing<br>phone screens and and whatever that<br>process will entail in terms of our<br>overall selection process and the<br>sacramentary testing it's very valued<br>within KPMG and our partners and our<br>managers do value it very much and as an<br>indicator of someone's intelligence and<br>that being said we don't put our<br>hundred-percent wasting on that on those<br>psychometric testing so if you<br>completely count the testing are you you<br>know having a really bad day and talk to<br>us we can you know we take things like<br>that into consideration and you know if<br>you've under a lot of time pressure<br>you've got lots of assignments then<br>like that you know again just talk to us<br>and let us know that you did struggle<br>and and again we just look at everything<br>so for psychometric testing a couple of<br>important things to know would be again<br>make sure you somewhere quiet free from<br>any distractions somewhere you can<br>really focus and keep a pen and paper<br>handy and think about how you respond to<br>questions so if it is you know type in<br>something or if it is writing something<br>with pen and paper<br>think about how you work the best and<br>just make sure that you apply that and<br>try and yeah have a cup of tea next year<br>my top three tips with psychometric<br>tests are to practice whether that's<br>online or with the Career Service if you<br>go in prepared you stand a much better<br>chance at performing to your highest<br>ability than if you haven't my second<br>bit of advice would be to remain as calm<br>as possible under pressure and a third<br>bit of advice that feeds into this is<br>pick a good time and place to sit the<br>tests you don't want to be distracted<br>you don't want to feel like you're<br>running out of time you have to get out<br>of a room at a certain time for instance<br>if you've booked one in the library you<br>just need to make everything as calm as<br>possible in your environment so you can<br>give it your all and focus 100% on them<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
