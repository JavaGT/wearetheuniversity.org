font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so a collector should be a maximum of a<br>page and it should be tailored to a<br>particular company that you are applying<br>for and be very very conscious of the<br>company in the name that you are putting<br>on that because we've had instances<br>where the wrong company name has been<br>sent to us and it just doesn't give a<br>great first impression it's just really<br>good to show that attention to detail<br>when it comes to a cover letter it<br>actually does depend on which job you're<br>applying for for example if you're<br>applying for a communicative role<br>customer service facing or something to<br>do with marketing and communications you<br>should probably try and have a lengthier<br>cover letter than something that's more<br>technically based I think a good<br>benchmark is about half a page if you<br>can but no longer than a full page if<br>you've got a lot to say a cover letter<br>should be approximately one page long so<br>it's similar to your CV if it's too<br>short it will show a lack of detail and<br>if it if it's too long you can get lost<br>in all of the detail or it might come<br>across as a bit<br>wofully we kind of want you to be clear<br>and concise while also giving us enough<br>information to see that you've put the<br>evident<br>and the best structure for a cover<br>letter should from my opinion include<br>four steps that would be the opening so<br>tell us about the job that you're<br>applying for and why the next would be<br>why you so talk to why you think you're<br>suitable for the job and as well as the<br>skills that you have in order to do the<br>job well the third step would be why PwC<br>so what attracted you to the role and<br>why do you want to work in this role and<br>work for PwC and then finally ended off<br>really strongly by reaffirming your<br>skills as well as your enthusiasm for<br>being a part of the process so for us I<br>like to see in your structure of your<br>cover letter you introducing yourself so<br>who you are what you studied and what<br>role you're applying for secondly we'd<br>like to see that you've done some<br>research into Maine Freight<br>shows us that you've you know you've put<br>some effort and you actually know who<br>you are applying for the third part<br>would be why main freight so you've done<br>the research and what has come out of<br>that that makes you want to apply for us<br>and for why you're a good fit so skills<br>values goals how does that all kind of<br>filter into that role in the company so<br>your cover letter is essentially a<br>summary of your CV it needs to be short<br>quick to read but it's essentially your<br>argument for why the recruiter should<br>read on further a few years ago prior to<br>my time at Deloitte I had a gentleman<br>apply for a role he had no relevant<br>experience really he'd worked in the<br>States and customer service and and it<br>was for a retail job but his cover<br>leader was so well done and so<br>impressive that we got him in front of<br>the manager for an interview and he went<br>on to be top salesman within three<br>months of being with the business so I<br>put a lot of stock in a cover leader but<br>it can't just be a regurgitation of your<br>CV tell us something different about you<br>so yourself that way<br>I think genuinely there actually is an<br>imperfect structure for a cover letter I<br>think the difference between a good and<br>a bad<br>have a letter is how well you've<br>explained where you're coming from a<br>wave played for that role and why you're<br>the right fit if it's a long cover<br>letter if it's a short cover letter<br>that's perfectly fine but if you can<br>convey to me that you're the right<br>person for this role and you want it<br>genuinely because of what it is and who<br>we are<br>you'll always stick out more than<br>someone who's done in generic print off<br>from the internet when it comes to<br>realistically if you're a successful<br>candidate it's going to be viewed by a<br>lot of people and that's a good thing<br>so if you address it to save a recruiter<br>whether that's myself for sure born or<br>the recruitment team that's perfectly<br>fine we're not going to hold that<br>against you and I think as a company we<br>don't really get hung up on formalities<br>when it comes to exactly who it's<br>addressed to so that shouldn't be<br>something you worry about however the<br>people that will read your cover letter<br>hopefully if you're successful it'll<br>start off being just the recruitment<br>team and then from there we will send<br>your application out to the other team<br>leads so everybody really gets to have<br>their say and who becomes next part of<br>always remember when you're creating<br>your cover letter to tailor it to the<br>employer that you're applying for you<br>can use the cover letter to highlight<br>the strengths that are relevant for the<br>role and make sure you tie in the job<br>description with your cover letter and<br>so I guess just additional points for<br>students to know throughout that CV<br>cover letter process and it's really<br>good for us to have it neatly laid out<br>so you know black black fun and keep it<br>simple things like that keep it clear<br>keep it concise try to avoid any crazy<br>fun so adding loads of colors or things<br>like that and you want it to be is a<br>professional document and you know you<br>do want that to come across as your<br>first impression and that we get a view<br>as I come to do it so just bear things<br>like that in mind so some other things<br>that a student needs to know is again<br>proofread it's really important to make<br>sure that your spelling in your grammar<br>and punctuation or all creat also<br>personality so if you can put an<br>anecdote or something and let us say why<br>main Freight is a good fit for you or<br>something quirky about yourself that<br>makes you kind of leap off the page<br>that's always fantastic and also make it<br>personal so if you can find the name of<br>the recruiter it shows that you've gone<br>a little bit beyond just the surface<br>level research you've taken the time to<br>make it personal to the person who will<br>be reading your CV don't copy and paste<br>directly from the company website read<br>the company website but don't copy and<br>paste from it because we know what we<br>put on the company website and if we've<br>read it from your cover letter we've<br>read it from 500 others grammar check<br>make sure that when you are spelling 0<br>write with an X note is it two that<br>you're not spelling accurate wrong and<br>and also if you're actually applying for<br>the right company I can't tell you how<br>many times I've seen cover letters where<br>there's at some point in the letter<br>they're using somebody else's name and<br>it's such a shame I understand it but<br>it's also it's such a shame so try and<br>be as accurate as possible and if you<br>need somebody else to read over it get<br>your mom and dad to read over it it'll<br>be fine every year during graduate round<br>we get a number of students who<br>you copy their calves Aleta for each of<br>the replications and use the same one<br>and the reason we know that is because<br>we generally have a competitor's name on<br>the cover leader that's a your your<br>process is over<br>the attention to detail required for<br>doing a cover letter is key so make sure<br>you're dressing it to the right company<br>if you have met somebody at an event<br>make sure you mention them name job you<br>meet somebody an event that's really<br>important to us so it shows that you've<br>gone along and you've spoken to people<br>and who worked for Deloitte currently<br>and the reason you're applying to this<br>particular service sign is something<br>that you've thought through and reasoned<br>and in got some research done on another<br>thing that you should do is your cover<br>letter is that read it out loud make<br>sure it makes sense and once you're sure<br>it makes sense get a number of other<br>people to read it your attention to<br>detail your grandma your spelling all<br>need to be just right so don't let<br>yourself down by not doing these really<br>really simple things that can mean the<br>difference between you getting an<br>interview with us or not<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
