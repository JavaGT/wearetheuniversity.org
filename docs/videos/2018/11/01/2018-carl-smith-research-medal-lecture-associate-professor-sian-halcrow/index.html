Coto<br>tenets are tokoto a good evening and<br>welcome to this the University of Otago<br>rope Heath trust award in carlsmith<br>middle lecture to be presented tonight<br>by associate professor professor Shan<br>Halcro from the department of anatomy<br>I'll kill her<br>my name is Richard Blakey I'm the deputy<br>Vice Chancellor for research and<br>enterprise here at Otago and that means<br>that I have oversight of the research<br>across our three wonderful main campus<br>locations in Dunedin Christchurch and<br>Wellington and one of the most enjoyable<br>duties that I have the privilege to<br>perform every year is this role of<br>presenting the the lecturer to you but<br>also having the an enviable job of<br>trying to sharing the committee that<br>that determines who should get this<br>award so it's my great pleasure to share<br>the celebration of outstanding research<br>achievement with you all colleagues<br>members of the local community and<br>importantly friends and Farnell of our<br>middle recipient a particular welcome<br>goes to Shawn's supporters and family<br>who are here to your mum and dad<br>Janette and Robert and two family<br>friends that are here tonight Maria and<br>Grandma Kai attend our koto to you now<br>the order of ceremonies is that I will<br>say some words then I'll invite chance<br>head of department Lisa professor Lisa<br>Lisa Mehta Sue Smith to introduce the<br>lecture following this I have the task<br>of summing up and giving a photo thanks<br>after which we will present Chun with<br>the award in the middle which will be<br>around here somewhere yes I see that<br>there they are here usually and we don't<br>tell the awardee we do have one last<br>stage in the selection process and<br>that's by acclamation we'll ask<br>we'll ask you the audience whether or<br>not she deserves it so it's got to be a<br>good good talk in Chan and then we'll<br>retire should that all go well we will<br>retire to the reception in seminar room<br>five here on this level for refreshments<br>and fellowship now we<br>this award it's the Cal Smith middle and<br>Rohith trust award and I just want to<br>tell you a little bit about these<br>firstly their purpose the purpose of<br>these awards which were established in<br>2003 and are all always awarded together<br>it's very clear they are to quote<br>promote research at the University of<br>Otago and to give recognition to<br>outstanding research performance of<br>early career staff which is for those<br>who have been at her Tago for at least<br>two years but have total research career<br>appointments of less than ten years it<br>is research experience and excellence<br>that is the defining factor not age this<br>year we had 10 or a dozen nominees who<br>all pretty much met the award criteria<br>with bells on and after much<br>deliberation we have the brilliant bio<br>archaeologists from the department of<br>anatomy in Shan Halcro as a recipient<br>now what stood out to the committee<br>about Sean's nomination this year was<br>not just one major internationally<br>significant achievement but the breadth<br>and depth of her contributions as I'm<br>sure we all hear tonight a Shonda chant<br>is a great deal through international<br>collaborations publishing graduate<br>student supervision support for early<br>career research development gaining<br>extra extramural funding and quite a lot<br>of it thank you very much and everything<br>she does across this breadth is just<br>quite simply excellent and it's that<br>that that breadth of excellence across<br>everything that Shawn does that made it<br>really the deciding factor we don't just<br>decide amongst ourselves we seek<br>external views and referees reports<br>we're glowing and it's the remarks such<br>as quote that the remarks helped us<br>decide the case such as quote who<br>virtually matchless record in accessing<br>highly competitive research funding and<br>her growing list of success for graduate<br>students supervision and this referee<br>stated wit that they had first-hand<br>experience of the care and empathy she<br>displays for this important field of<br>academic responsibility and then from a<br>someone who was very senior and<br>distinguished in the<br>yield quote dr. hell Krause publications<br>are impressive and their quality and<br>their sheer volume puts many of us to<br>shame so it's that range of attributes<br>across all of the all of the areas of<br>research responsibility that did the job<br>for us so I think you get it now before<br>I asked shantih shantih Jodi to<br>introduce her in the lecture a little<br>bit about the award in the middle so why<br>is it the ROE Heath trust award and I<br>carlsmith middle now ones for the money<br>in ones for the glory the ROE Heath<br>trust was established in 1964 to support<br>the work of the University and it was<br>established by Carl Smith a prominent<br>Dunedin businessman and a member of the<br>University Council and it was used to<br>establish endow a $5,000 researcher<br>support award that bears the trust name<br>at the same time the university<br>commissioned the middle in circles honor<br>as the glory to accompany the money and<br>actually a little bit about carlsmith we<br>can recognize the contributions that so<br>Carl and his wife Lady Katherine made<br>over many years after coming to New<br>Zealand from the family estate of Roe<br>Heath in Birmingham so therefore the<br>Rohe's trust the family connection to<br>the University in the award continues<br>with so Kyle's daughter Katherine having<br>lived in the region until and until very<br>recently being a regular attendee at<br>these awards now so Kyle was a<br>well-known author in addition to his<br>business and community contributions and<br>in fact as well as the award and the<br>middle there is a quirky little gift<br>that we'll have at the end I think we<br>might have I might have a copy of it<br>here we give a copy of a book he was an<br>author of a number of things out this<br>isn't a copy of his volume sweet success<br>which is a history of the chocolate<br>maker Cadbury Frey Hudson that he was<br>the chief executive of but it is a<br>humourist home called New Zealand from<br>into Z that's become somewhat of a<br>collector's piece for its interesting<br>insights into 20th century New Zealand<br>culture and society let's say of a<br>different age the book is long out of<br>print that we like to present a copy to<br>the middle recipient every year and in<br>fact one of the jobs<br>out of my office's to hunt trade me and<br>other sources of second-hand books to<br>make sure that we have sufficient<br>numbers of this volume on on hand to be<br>able to award one to the recipient so<br>that's a little bit about why we're here<br>but mainly we're here to hear Shawn give<br>her Cal Smith middle lecture so without<br>further ado I'll hand over to her<br>department professor Lisa met Sue Smith<br>to introduce the speaker to you thank<br>you thank you returned tena koutou katoa<br>I do feel particularly pleased to be<br>able to introduce Shawn tonight<br>I first met Shawn when she was a<br>first-year student in my introduction to<br>biological anthropology course at the<br>University of Auckland and when you have<br>several hundred students in your first<br>year courses you don't generally<br>remember many of them but but Shawn<br>stood out not only for our amazing<br>handwriting which was always great<br>because when you're reading her essays<br>and exam scripts they were so easy to<br>read<br>but she was truly the best undergraduate<br>student that I had ever taught so I was<br>truly dismayed when she didn't turn up<br>for the rest of her degree when I found<br>out that she came down here to our talk<br>but then I got to watch her as a<br>biological anthropologist developing<br>into a true professional and then I was<br>lucky enough to come down and join her<br>here at the University of Otago where I<br>got to really work with her as a<br>colleague and and see you know what an<br>amazing colleague she has grown into so<br>um yeah 2007 she received her PhD and is<br>already an associate professor with over<br>70 publications<br>a hundred and fifty plus conference<br>presentations she truly is a leader in<br>the field of early of childhood health<br>infant and childhood health in Southeast<br>Asia and an amazing amount of field work<br>there and more recently has extended her<br>work to South America and of course New<br>Zealand in the Pacific I'm so pleased to<br>see two of her mentors here tonight<br>Nancy tailless and Professor Charles<br>Higham<br>I was about to call you your son's name<br>I'm sorry Charles I'm all these Hyams<br>these professors I am here tonight<br>because I know that it means a lot to<br>Sean that you're here and it means a lot<br>to all of us to see her colleagues her<br>friends her students it's it's a great<br>award Sean and we're so so proud of you<br>so um I'd also like to welcome her<br>family and Paige her eldest of her two<br>beautiful daughters pages 13 and<br>watching her grow up has been amazing<br>and now Aliyah who's four who's not here<br>tonight so you know on top of being an<br>amazing academic and contributor to our<br>field and all of the blogs and Twitter<br>and everything else you do your<br>daughter's are the biggest priority and<br>the most important so as a mother I'm<br>getting off so I feel kind of like a bit<br>like a like a mom here talking about my<br>own daughter but it is it is my great<br>honor to introduce Sean associate<br>professor Sean Halcro my friend my<br>colleague and a member of the department<br>so tena koutou tena koutou katoa no my<br>Haider my just before I start you notice<br>that I've got a black screen I am going<br>to be showing some pictures of human<br>skeletal remains so just just a general<br>warning about this I'd like to think the<br>academic party<br>Harleen hang vice-chancellor Richard<br>Leakey for giving a really amazing<br>outline of who sue Cal Smith was and<br>significance of his work Lisa Miller so<br>Smith it was a really lovely<br>introduction and I feel very honored and<br>my family who have come down in my<br>daughter who's my biggest critic so sure<br>but she'll be blatantly honest at the<br>end if I don't make sense<br>I haven't our family friends I might<br>also see some friends up there from from<br>Obama drew Judith and Roger so it's<br>awesome to see you and also to Maria and<br>Graham mum and devs thank you very much<br>for all your support and I know that<br>there are a lot of my friends who have<br>got young children in five-thirty is a<br>bad time for them<br>so I'll just wave to them it I think<br>that's better live streamed to<br>potentially so so thank you for your Fe<br>thank you for your support and love and<br>also to Lisa Nehru for all your<br>wonderful help I think you somewhere oh<br>so it's both a privilege in a challenge<br>to try and explain my work to a general<br>audience tonight what I really want to<br>do is give some case studies on my work<br>that's really looking at major human<br>transitional events focusing on the<br>development of Agriculture and the<br>effects that they hit on people but in<br>particular looking at the effects that<br>it had on infants and children because<br>they're very sensitive barometers of<br>population health but before I start<br>talking about that I want to give my<br>acknowledgments I had to quickly retype<br>these because my PowerPoint decided half<br>an hour before giving this that it<br>wasn't going to play ball so I'm sorry<br>if anyone's name spelt wrong or I've<br>missed someone out I do want to<br>acknowledge from the University all the<br>support they've given me through you<br>orgs and also the school of biomedical<br>sciences and also the Department of<br>anatomy and I'm particularly want to<br>think the various HIDs and the<br>Department of anatomy from when I was a<br>post grad Gareth Jones and Helen<br>Nicholson and most recently neo Kimmel<br>in Lisa meadow so Smurfs have been<br>amazing in terms of mentorship and just<br>helping me in every way so I really<br>appreciate all your help research<br>doesn't happen in a vacuum and an intra<br>Paula G we have a lot of people that we<br>usually deal with through<br>multidisciplinary projects so I've just<br>listed my lab group up there in I want<br>to say particular thanks to my mentor<br>colleague my PhD supervisor Nancy<br>Taylor's you know talk a little bit<br>about here later and my other colleagues<br>postdocs PhD students and other students<br>our work cannot happen without the<br>amazing support staff that we have I'm<br>not sure if it was in the same order<br>anymore no it's not so I won't name them<br>all but I really think that we are very<br>lucky in the Department of anatomy to<br>have such an amazing support staff and<br>this is what really helps us excel from<br>the Department of anatomy of had<br>long-standing collaboration with<br>Professor Charles Higham he's here<br>tonight and also Cyril Schaffer of Co<br>supervisor and done work with him and I<br>also just wanted to acknowledge some of<br>my old teachers in mentors there and in<br>particular I wanted to say thank you to<br>Richard Balter I'm not sure if he's here<br>but he's always very kind to me in his<br>read multiple master and the<br>applications for me when he's not on the<br>panel so I think I am a bottle of gin or<br>something and I want to acknowledge our<br>Thai counterparts in particular dr.<br>Rutter Lata surrett who's worked with<br>Charles for many years over in Thailand<br>in her team including doing an hour in<br>other family members and I also want to<br>pay particular technology to the<br>communities that we work in worth in a<br>particular time unit of ban on what who<br>actually become active within our<br>research and we couldn't actually do<br>that without them so someone said it<br>might be nice to talk a little bit about<br>my personal background in as you can see<br>from the picture with brown in in frills<br>I was born in the late 1970s an Auckland<br>and my parents had a dream to live the<br>good life and they decided to travel<br>down to central Southland<br>so they carted us down there that's<br>before my younger sister was born so I'm<br>one of five children it's always a very<br>busy household mum obviously was looking<br>after all the last kids but she was also<br>running the farm and she was also<br>working the outside of the home and dad<br>was working full-time as well with his<br>real estate and other businesses so what<br>they really taught me was a lot of<br>independence in perseverance as well in<br>having an older brother who's tall<br>weighs thumped me I hate to be become<br>quite you know strong I think I found<br>school quite easy which was lucky I<br>wasn't very challenged I don't think in<br>because I was seen is a bright child I<br>was pushed into doing a lot of<br>mathematics a lot of science but I<br>actually really liked social science and<br>it wasn't until I went to university<br>that I thought hey I can actually<br>combine these two so I can do a ba BSC<br>and I love biology and I loved social<br>science biological anthropology so I<br>mean I did a little bit of human<br>evolution and the seventh form live a<br>year that is now a year thirteen and<br>started as Lisa said my University<br>undergrad at Oakland and it was amazing<br>history of anthropological thought was<br>it right so yeah and that really stayed<br>with me Lisa was one of the lecturers<br>for there and it was really just looking<br>at our field and how our research is<br>actually colored by things that are<br>happening in history and just really<br>inspired me to keep on going with<br>biological anthropology in archaeology I<br>saw the light<br>and came down to Otago no offense no I<br>actually came down to be honest to otar<br>go to be closer to my parents<br>and I did have to do a bit of work I<br>worked full-time and studied full-time<br>at the same time to try and support<br>myself and it was in the second year<br>that I was down here that I did<br>biological anthropology through everyone<br>which at the time was called in through<br>ology 3:07 and that just really Helle<br>Buckley called a native there<br>Nancy taught him to that nifty tailor<br>stood him to that and also Kate to meet<br>who are now all my colleagues and it was<br>really life-changing I mean I loved the<br>theory that their teaching but actually<br>going into the labs going into the<br>amazing and SME museum that we've got<br>and working with material was invaluable<br>so it's really like a change life<br>so it's a very shy student and I<br>remember walking into the department of<br>anatomy at the end of my third year and<br>I wanted to go up and see Nancy and ask<br>her about her work in Thailand and I<br>remember coming up and neat was<br>secretary look and I see it too here<br>hello I'm here to see Nancy tails no<br>this is a bad bad start but Irene tap<br>and talk to Nancy and now know how to<br>pronounce her name and she very kindly<br>took me under her wing and she took me<br>through my fourth year dissertation<br>working on some skeletal remains that<br>were at the time held and the anatomy<br>department from Thailand and at the end<br>of that year she offered a amazing<br>experience for me to go over and help<br>excavate<br>it's a tie site it was co-directed by<br>Charles Higham and Gretchen et Ossa drat<br>and since that time I've had other<br>opportunities working at the site the<br>site's called ban on wash and I'll talk<br>about it but a little bit later during<br>my PhD the first be saying it's<br>irrelevant to me my first child I have<br>came along and mrs. Paige sleeping on a<br>pile of chapters from my thesis she was<br>in my office and she must have been<br>tired she usually just held her to go to<br>sleep but she put down a duvet and fell<br>asleep on that so I thought it was a<br>good photo to take and this is a photo<br>of me graduating from my PhD in NC the<br>errand little Paige who I think they're<br>just tuned to sorry Nancy I know you<br>don't like the effect so but I think<br>it's lovely<br>so he's been a hard road I suppose for<br>me in a way that is very hard being an<br>academic and being a being a parent and<br>it is particularly hard being an<br>anthropologist and although the travel<br>that we do so I just wanted to think<br>Paige for putting up with a sometimes<br>absent-minded mother not totally engaged<br>with everything you do but I hope you've<br>also had some amazing opportunities and<br>I hope to give you many more changes as<br>well coming around the world with me and<br>I think sometimes it's easy to forget we<br>can't become so focused on the papers in<br>the outputs that we forget the human<br>connections we end through my work<br>especially in Northeast Thailand we've<br>been working with the same group of<br>people on the left there and the peach<br>it's doctor actually toss a rat and you<br>can see beside me that's Nancy Taylor's<br>in other dear Thai friends who all work<br>on the excavation<br>in there were the lifelong friends and I<br>could say that they're basically part of<br>my family so it's it's amazing place to<br>work and it's been life-changing so it's<br>the hard part over and I didn't cry so I<br>just wanted to now talk a little bit<br>about the background of what our<br>research group does and also give some<br>case studies of my work that looks at<br>assessing the agricultural transition in<br>the past so what does bio archeology bio<br>archaeology by its very simplest<br>definition as the study of human remains<br>from archaeological sites but it's not<br>just looking at these skeletons at such<br>it's trying to interpret what's going on<br>in terms of stress in adaptation within<br>a and and within the environment so<br>looking at the natural and social<br>environment and how they're interact<br>with the human biology and it's the only<br>direct way in which we can actually look<br>at people from the past is actually<br>looking at their skeletal remains but we<br>are all the children are definitely<br>represented and a lot of skeletal<br>samples but up to about two decades ago<br>they weren't looked at very much and I<br>think it's because and part that<br>biological anthropology used to be very<br>interested on looking at physical<br>characteristics of people so they're<br>interested in looking at the cranial<br>morphology in how different groups may<br>relate or not relate to others so a lot<br>of measurements of skulls and that type<br>of thing we've moved on since then and<br>we're more interested in looking at<br>human adaptation and plasticity but<br>because children are actively growing<br>these skulls<br>necessarily completes when you get them<br>from excavation so they're no use to be<br>able to measure things like that so<br>that's part of the reason why they<br>hadn't been looked at very much in the<br>past but over the last two decades there<br>has been a flurry of research in the<br>area which is great and bio<br>archaeologists now acknowledge that<br>infants and children are the most<br>sensitive kind of measures of Health and<br>a population they are actively growing<br>physically and they also have a<br>development developing immune system so<br>the very sensitive barometers of<br>population stress and my research group<br>is also particularly interested and<br>looking at the Nexus or the relationship<br>between mother and the infant or<br>maternal fetus Nexus and this is really<br>important because during pregnancy<br>mother in the child are very susceptible<br>to disease and also the exacerbation of<br>existing disease for example an<br>infection with cosmo DMV vex or<br>Plasmodium falciparum during pregnancy<br>can lead to chronic anemia placental<br>malaria on fiction reducing the birth<br>weight and a risk of neonatal death and<br>also death of the mother and that's well<br>known as well that disruptions of<br>physiological stress during development<br>especially in utero can have lifelong<br>implications for house so how do we<br>actually look at stress in in health and<br>individuals in the past this is just a<br>picture that I've actually pulled off my<br>colleagues paper which I thought was<br>very good looking at different stress<br>and the caters so you'll see the top<br>left there you've got arrows and they're<br>pointing to small<br>all pets are hopefully you can see that<br>in their linear pets what they actually<br>represent is part of the tous that<br>hasn't formed properly during<br>development so it implies that this<br>individual has actually gone under some<br>kind of stress or some kind of<br>physiological stress we don't know what<br>their stressors that could be<br>malnutrition it could be some kind of<br>infection so we call these nonspecific<br>stress indicators we don't know the<br>etiology necessarily and you can see<br>underneath that what they're does as a<br>radiograph of the distal tibia so that<br>the bottom of your shin bone and you can<br>see those white lines hopefully those<br>lines are lines of Arrested Development<br>and they form after resumption of growth<br>after you've had some kind of stunting<br>occurring there's another way that we<br>can look at stress and this picture is<br>of a child I think seven years of age<br>and the and it's after being excavated<br>and what Johnny found is that Wallace<br>individual has a dental age of about<br>seven it was very very stunted for for<br>age so this is another way in which we<br>can look at stress in the past and we<br>can also look at other skeletal<br>pathology which may give us indications<br>of specific types of disease but most of<br>the stuff that we look at is actually<br>nonspecific<br>so what are my research questions and<br>wires and thus important I'm interested<br>in looking at in large part the effects<br>on human biology of major transitions in<br>the past and one of those transitions<br>was as I said before the development and<br>intensification of Agriculture and thus<br>his impacts on the whole society<br>including changes in health<br>Chinese and fertility internment also<br>changes in terms of social complexity<br>so the general bio archeological model<br>of health change with agricultural<br>development assists that there'll be a<br>deterioration of health with the advent<br>of Agriculture so it may sound a little<br>bit different from what you thought<br>agriculture is often seen by some people<br>to be something it was good but unfit<br>that's actually caused a lot of major<br>problems for society today when you have<br>the development of Agriculture you often<br>have communities who are once<br>potentially moving around in hunting<br>staying in one spot so they become<br>sedentary you have more people living<br>together<br>you've got sometimes a surplus of food<br>fertility may change your bigger<br>societies more unsanitary living<br>conditions in as well in some places<br>with the development of Agriculture they<br>become reliant on a single more reliant<br>on just a single food source so they<br>don't have much dietary diversity so<br>therefore they can have issues of<br>malnutrition so it's not all good but<br>this model has been developed really in<br>the US and the in Europe and in the<br>Middle East but research that's been<br>done by Nancy Taylor's and other<br>colleagues has found that in Southeast<br>Asia there's no real clear change and<br>health with agricultural development a<br>problem that we do have is that we don't<br>have a lot of pre agricultural societies<br>to compare them to so we're usually just<br>comparing post agricultural societies in<br>ones with increasing intensification of<br>Agriculture and the hypothesis is or the<br>reasoning it's given for this<br>instant or what's happening in Southeast<br>Asia is that there is a retention of a<br>very broad spectrum subsistence base so<br>just as today the rice agriculturalists<br>and the Northeast are reliant on rice<br>they also they fish they hunt they have<br>a lot of wild plant resources fruits so<br>that that's a different kind of scenario<br>to say what happened and the u.s. in<br>Europe so why should we care about the<br>development of Agriculture in the start<br>of her in the application that heads on<br>human health that continues to have<br>implications on humans today nearly half<br>of the world mainly children and women<br>live in poverty with little access to<br>health care they have poor nutrition and<br>they live in crowded unsanitary living<br>conditions and you could argue that this<br>actually has its ultimate beginnings<br>with the adoption of Agriculture<br>although I acknowledge that some of the<br>issues that we have with poverty is<br>actually linked to modern social<br>political or economic relationships as<br>well so most of my work is actually done<br>in Thailand in a very tropical<br>environment I also do work in other<br>places in Southeast Asia I've been lucky<br>enough to work and Cambodia and Laos and<br>Indonesia have been part of a project<br>and a couple of projects in New Zealand<br>and starving some work in China but I<br>want to talk today about work in<br>Thailand just giving some tastes<br>examples and also work that I do in a<br>very different place in the world and<br>this is a northern Chile which is the<br>drop in the area of Arica which is the<br>driest hot desert in the world and I<br>think it's really useful to look at<br>different places to answer this question<br>because we can look at the range of<br>human responses and these diverse<br>environments so for my PhD thanks to<br>Charles in this team of archaeologists<br>we were building up a repository of<br>human skeletal remains from different<br>parts of Thailand in from different time<br>periods so I can look at trying to<br>assess the impact of the agricultural<br>transition on infants and children so<br>what I did is chose sites that ranged<br>from the Neolithic so from about 4000<br>years ago and spend right through to the<br>Iron Age where you have the<br>intensification of Agriculture and major<br>technological and social change so I<br>used a number of different methods to<br>try and look at health change and stress<br>and I found that there was no clear<br>deterioration and stress and health over<br>time but I did find that there was an<br>increase and nonspecific stress<br>indicators and the Iron Age which was<br>interesting and I also found in increase<br>and the number of infant dying so<br>potentially a demographic change was<br>happening there but it was difficult<br>because as I just showed you before on<br>this map the sites were from southeast<br>right up to the Northeast<br>so I couldn't necessarily control four<br>different environments okay which could<br>have been having implications on the<br>results and we also up till that time<br>had quite poor preservation from the<br>Iron Age sites so I couldn't fully look<br>at lots of the skeletal pathology that I<br>would have liked to have looked at for<br>that<br>but luckily Charles and eruption Lee and<br>Nancy in others have had projects there<br>late in the last two decades that are<br>centered around the upper Moon River<br>Valley the side of nan bun bun nan was<br>has a very long Occupational sequence<br>and it's got over 700 individuals and it<br>spans from the neolithic to the iron age<br>so it's a really good site to try and<br>look at these health differences over<br>time without having to control for<br>environmental differences nan bum jack<br>is the most recently excavated site in<br>that region by our group and this is<br>really an important site because it's a<br>very late Iron Age site it's got a good<br>sample size and at his amazing<br>preservation which is very very odd for<br>the Iron Age and Charles has also<br>excavated bun and cow earlier and which<br>has over a hundred and dividuals which<br>is a Bronze Age and no new Lok which is<br>in the Iron Age so now I just want to<br>turn to some of the work that I've been<br>doing looking at how we can use infant<br>and child mortality to tell something<br>about population growth fertility and<br>demography from the Upper Moon River<br>Valley how to make this I can't see this<br>display properly so I'm just going to<br>have to paleo demographic analysis is<br>very important for understanding<br>population growth and also looking at<br>health and maternal stress typically<br>though individuals this and five years<br>of age are excluded from these analysis<br>just despite the fact that a lot of<br>sites actually had very high<br>representation of infants and children<br>in research has shown that populations<br>with high fertility actually have very<br>high rates of an<br>and in fetal mortality so it could be<br>argued that there are very sensitive<br>measures for demographic change so if we<br>look at the site so on the left you've<br>got the Bronze Age sites and on the<br>right you've got the Iron Age site so<br>we're looking chronologically you can<br>see the gray bar that's the number of<br>individuals under 1 you can see that<br>there's a significant increase in the<br>iron age with age at the with mortality<br>and you're also interestingly the late<br>Iron Age site non banjac right on the<br>right-hand side there's got a high<br>number of fetal deaths as well as the<br>late period of burn on what which has<br>just right beside dead so does that mean<br>that there was a payload immigrant<br>change and the Iron Age was something<br>happened being in terms of fertility or<br>something happening in terms of poor<br>health were these infants and children<br>were dying or all births are not<br>necessarily mutually exclusive so how<br>can we try and understand what's<br>happening in the Iron Age interestingly<br>at the same time is these demographic<br>changes were happening in changes also<br>and stress and Decatur's there was<br>faltering of the annual monsoon and the<br>Northeast in archeologists argue that<br>this gave an impetus for management of<br>water is evidence by the development of<br>these modes so you can see these this is<br>a archaeological site and these are<br>actual emotes for water storage around<br>here at the same time we've got evidence<br>for deforestation through pollen<br>analysis and also other microfossil<br>analysis there would have been a change<br>with the development of moats there<br>would have been a lot of standing water<br>and it's a great habitat for Victor's of<br>disease including snails and fish<br>Hellmuth's protozoa and it's a preferred<br>habitat for mosquitoes including those<br>that carry malaria so we would expect to<br>see if this was the case a high burden<br>of disease on infants causing and<br>mortality and very young child mortality<br>and it's what we seem to see we've also<br>got a lot of archaeological information<br>about the intensification of wheat rice<br>agriculture we've got archaeological<br>tools that one in the middle of the<br>ploughshare and lots of circles found at<br>sites in the Iron Age and we've also got<br>pollen analysis of rice field weed<br>species which is very interesting we<br>also see major socio-economic changes<br>during the Iron Age populations increase<br>in size as well as the density of the<br>sites along the landscape in Charles<br>Higham has estimated that sediment sizes<br>could be between one and two thousand<br>people<br>we've got increasing trade links that<br>have seen through increasing number and<br>variety of grave Goods for example and<br>this would have brought not just new<br>trade goods but potentially novel<br>diseases to the area with increased<br>trade and archaeologists argue that from<br>the archaeological evidence there was<br>probably affects social hierarchy which<br>could have mean that there was<br>differential access to resources and<br>also division of labor which would have<br>had consequences on house so what are we<br>saying are we saying that there was<br>actually an agricultural transition<br>later in the Iron Age perhaps I think<br>the bio archaeological and<br>archaeological evidence actually points<br>to a health shift during that time<br>we look at the infant and child data and<br>this really supports the need for<br>regional assessment of these changes so<br>moving on to a very different part of<br>the world the Atacama Desert is you can<br>see from the map this is the region that<br>we're interested in right up here in<br>Arica and this is very close to the<br>Peruvian border and as I said before<br>this is in the desert as the driest hot<br>desert in the world in its famous<br>because it's got the first evidence for<br>artificial mummification of people and<br>the supriya<br>the Egyptian mummification by almost<br>three millennia so it's quite<br>significant and the reason that I was<br>very interested in doing work here my<br>colleague Bernardo arias I in the VN<br>stand and invited me to do a project<br>with them was because it had a very long<br>chronological sequence that were very<br>well dated from the archaic period<br>dating back to about 11,000 years ago<br>through to the early formative when you<br>have supplementary horticultural ISM and<br>in the late formative period from about<br>2500 years ago we have the introduction<br>of cultivars and we hypothesize that the<br>effects of health change would have been<br>heightened in this area with agriculture<br>because it's such a marginal environment<br>so what we did is we for our Marsden<br>grant developed a research project that<br>looked at lots of different methods<br>looking at stress looking at paleo<br>pathology of disease and also looking at<br>different ways of assessing diet through<br>stable isotopic analysis chemical<br>analysis and also dental wear so I just<br>want to now show two very short case<br>studies one of them has been published<br>by dr. any snotty<br>to PhD on this mouseland project her PhD<br>aim was to look at the potential impact<br>of changing subsistence economy on the<br>prevalence of metabolic and infectious<br>disease and if there was a relationship<br>between those and she had a very good<br>sample size there for her PhD and she<br>also looked at some other smaller sites<br>that really actually included a new PhD<br>in the end but she's published on them<br>and I just want to talk about a case<br>series which is really interesting from<br>the site called Kyani seven now this is<br>a really interesting site because it<br>actually spends from the archaic period<br>so that archaea come together a period<br>through to the time when you've got the<br>adoption of domestic it's on the coast<br>so there were twelve individuals at the<br>site eight of them were adults and four<br>of them were infants and they're all<br>Piron eight so they all died around the<br>time of booths around the time of a<br>newborn all as you can see from the<br>photo is very well preserved the<br>skeletal lesions were found on all the<br>newborns which were suggestive of<br>chronic hemorrhage and poor bone matrix<br>formation that's my typo so I just<br>wanted to show you what we look at in<br>terms of paleo pathology and this is all<br>in is wonderful work I don't take credit<br>for this at all this is part of your<br>cranium so it's a parietal fragment so<br>it's up here of a newborn and you can<br>see here compared to this normal example<br>it's very very thin we can't really see<br>it it was gruesome but it's almost paper<br>thin okay and it's actually got a lot of<br>new bone growth as well so that's<br>abnormal<br>any thought that this could be some kind<br>of mineralization disorder and this<br>could be from metabolic disease<br>including Scooby she also found abnormal<br>new bone formation and porosity at<br>vascular sites so we have blood vessels<br>are and also in theses and these are<br>your sites and these are your sites are<br>where you have muscle attachments<br>essentially and this capillary<br>proliferation in the hyper vascular this<br>is from a hyper vascular response to<br>low-grade hemorrhage probably this new<br>bone growth here she also found new bone<br>growth on the inside of some of the<br>crania and you can see here you've got<br>this proliferation of you've got<br>capillary impressions here and this is<br>probably a response to low-grade<br>hemorrhage as well which has also may be<br>indicative of scurvy interestingly she<br>found mother baby Pierre within the<br>burial which is really interesting and<br>the female or let's suppose another baby<br>Pierre the female and this burial<br>actually had multiple cranial lesions<br>which are probably suggestive or even<br>diagnostic of scurvy so how do we<br>interpret this within the bio<br>archaeological context it's interesting<br>because these are newborns with evidence<br>for vitamin C deficiency and and it's<br>not what we find and the clinical<br>literature it's very really do people<br>talk about this in the clinical that<br>literature so that's really interesting<br>in itself and it's probably because the<br>evidence of it it's so subtle it<br>wouldn't necessarily come up and<br>radiographs and stuff like that but it<br>also say something about the shift in<br>agriculture at that time probably<br>a shift in resource use so going from<br>high vitamin C wild resources to low<br>vitamin C process cultivars potentially<br>and Annie also made a really important<br>point that the sub P rust your new bone<br>that we are seeing can only form if the<br>vitamin C is restored before death so<br>there was probably famine period so<br>you'd have vitamin C deficiency and then<br>you come out of that because you can't<br>have these lesions forming until after<br>the vitamin C is actually come back into<br>your body so she hypothesized that it<br>could have been some kind of famine<br>period through the El Nino Southern<br>Oscillation event actually so it's<br>really a really interesting and it also<br>means I think that the fetal period is<br>really good and Decatur of micronutrient<br>deficiency and children and pregnant<br>woman elect aiding woman have very high<br>metabolic requirements for vitamin C so<br>that makes a lot of sense that they<br>they come on time so another way that we<br>can look at the maternal and for Nexus<br>in looking at agricultural transition is<br>to look at feeding of aunt fence and<br>also weaning of infants in the weaning<br>time is really important because it's<br>fundamentally linked female fertility<br>and potentially to population growth we<br>can look at weaning through the analysis<br>of carbon in nitrogen isotope ratios so<br>this work has been done by sorry your<br>names come off here dr. Charlotte King<br>she has she had a Rutherford postdoc and<br>was also working on our Marsden and<br>she's done some great work looking at<br>isotopic evidence for weaning and diet<br>within the Atacama I won't go into too<br>much information about what isotopes are<br>but essentially what happens is when you<br>breastfeed you have a trophic level<br>shift okay so you're isotope value<br>we'll be higher than what you were<br>eating okay so you're actually consuming<br>milk that's produced from the mother so<br>you consuming something that's made from<br>the tissues okay so you're going to have<br>a higher isotope nitrogen isotope level<br>then the female mean okay<br>so this is just a schematic of what we<br>would expect to see with a weaning curve<br>and with agriculture what we would<br>expect is that worth more carbohydrate<br>rich foods better winning foods that you<br>may have a earlier weaning time okay<br>shallots on some amazing work applying<br>new techniques for sampling for isotopes<br>across the time of the tooth development<br>so she can actually trace through the<br>life history of the individuals at<br>specific times when the tooth was<br>however when we look over time from the<br>archaic period right through to a late<br>history late prehistory and to the<br>historic periods what we find is that<br>there's no systematic temporal changes<br>to weaning behavior and we also find<br>that the winning cubes and actually as<br>so this is an example of weaning kouf<br>so-called weaning hoof and what you see<br>here that the readers actually the<br>nitrogen so this is actually 28 parts<br>per million it drops down over eight<br>parts per mil so what Charlotte has<br>hypothesized is that this probably means<br>that there was a very very high infant<br>fetal stress and this drop and nitrogen<br>is coming down to this less stress after<br>booth between<br>actually this is where my slides go<br>funny okay and this is well this is<br>showing big spikes and nitrogen and big<br>troughs and spikes again and that's also<br>been interpreted as a result potentially<br>and stress rather than any dietary tract<br>change because the changes are too big<br>to be a trophic level shift okay so to<br>conclude using an approach that looks at<br>diverse regions or areas in the world we<br>can find that patterns of the health<br>change with agricultural transition are<br>regionally specific and they're much<br>more nuanced and the model predicts<br>recent advances and methods for loving<br>it infants including them and demography<br>analysis and paleo pathology and<br>isotopes sampling etc shows the<br>intricate relationship between the<br>mother and child and really illuminates<br>these stories of stress thank you very<br>much<br>but well done Charlotte's my a man in<br>view Walt asked her to wrap up and and<br>give a vote of thanks I think what we've<br>seen here is a wonderful example of the<br>of the strength and breadth of research<br>at the University and that ability for<br>us to develop strong young researchers<br>into future research leaders and then<br>see them as you did beautifully tonight<br>shall develop their next generation of<br>research leaders and I want to express<br>my appreciation for you recognizing<br>specifically your colleagues in<br>particular your young colleagues that<br>you are helping to develop along the way<br>one thing that struck me coming to the<br>University of Otago now seven years ago<br>into a into an area that has of<br>comprehensive coverage in particular<br>into Health Sciences from an engineering<br>background is their ability to connect<br>basic studies across a wide range of<br>areas into real problems or significance<br>to us to here today and I think what<br>you've shown us is that in looking at<br>the archaeological record you can<br>identify issues that we might think<br>about as we transition our agriculture<br>our social structures and as we think<br>about how we might as societies and<br>individuals respond to things like<br>climate change and disease incursions<br>you through your work and the work of<br>your colleagues have given us some<br>insights into those kinds of things<br>through working in some amazing places<br>that I'm very jealous about that I that<br>I don't think I could get the excuse to<br>work in just as a final remark I just<br>what you've also shown to me is the<br>strength of work in a particular area at<br>the University of Otago in in using<br>infants and children since of sensitive<br>barometers and it's actually quite good<br>that we've got our vice-chancellor here<br>tonight because we've got huge strengths<br>and in child and youth health and<br>well-being at the University of Otago so<br>gain acknowledging haline for an<br>outstanding world-leading work in child<br>psychology foking focusing on on very<br>very young children what you're showing<br>us Sean is that by focusing on some very<br>very old children some really old<br>children that we can also we can also<br>get in gain and the<br>standings overnight what I've learned<br>tonight that I didn't know not just<br>those health and physiological issues<br>but some of those social issues about<br>how that infant and her mother his or<br>her mother might interact through<br>through inference of things that are<br>deeply buried in the bio bio<br>archaeological record so I think you'll<br>all agree with me that sean has Pat<br>Shawn chad has passed the test and has<br>given an outstanding presentation<br>tonight so before I give the award I'd<br>like to ask you to join me in thanking<br>I would also before you if they would<br>like to thank Lisa end the team from<br>events we've got a new events team<br>tonight are in preparing for tonight and<br>thank you and please pass on my thanks<br>to the team and it's now my great<br>pleasure to award chan the 2018<br>the most is the is the is the book from<br>intern something - thank you so much<br>read your kids they know yeah yeah okay<br>and Raiders Lisa has initiated a new<br>surprise gift for you tonight as well so<br>please so thank you once again Sean and<br>now I'll invite you all perhaps after<br>another another round of applause for<br>appreciation to join us all for<br>refreshments in seminar room 5 thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
