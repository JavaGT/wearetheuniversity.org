gentlemen<br>i'm james ha cosby i am in the first<br>year of my PhD i had down the road at<br>School of Biological Sciences<br>I'm supervised by EJ low Scott Graham<br>and Kate angel and I'm here tonight to<br>talk to you about how placement system<br>proteins regulate endothelial<br>presentation of CTL 21 and subscript T<br>cell extravasation whoa which is an<br>absolute mouthful but I hope by the end<br>of this presentation you'll understand<br>how this is keeping you alive so the<br>first thing we have to ask ourselves is<br>what is one of these T cells X and T<br>cells are these little cells they patrol<br>your body and there's 400 billion of<br>them depending on how well or sick you<br>are at any time they constantly travel<br>around your blood your body in the blood<br>flow and they have to be able to access<br>every tissue because they are the immune<br>sentinels of the body they are looking<br>for anything foreign that might harm you<br>so they look for things like cancers and<br>virally infected cells and if they find<br>them<br>they can directly kill them they're also<br>really important in producing antibodies<br>that protect you against things like<br>bacteria viruses and fungi however they<br>also involve the production of cytokines<br>which are little molecules that cause<br>allergy and asthma<br>so the balance of T cells in your body<br>is really important so to give you a<br>slightly more graphic example this<br>balance is really key to preventing<br>autoimmune disease and cancer so if we<br>look at these images the one on the left<br>up here is the inside of someone's : and<br>that big red spot is not normal that<br>person has bowel cancer so they don't<br>have enough T cells so the cancer is<br>able to continue to proliferate will<br>eventually leave the bowel and kill them<br>conversely the person on the other side<br>has Crohn's disease they have too many T<br>cells which means they're in the process<br>of attacking themselves so all that kind<br>of whitish material that toolpaths<br>that's coming out of there and testing<br>because they're having this immune<br>response against themselves so it's<br>really important to keep you happy and<br>healthy that you're sitting somewhere in<br>the middle between those two so it's<br>really really important we find out how<br>this balance<br>so the main way that we can regulate<br>this is by looking at how t cells<br>circulate in the blood and how they exit<br>so this is my schematic diagram of what<br>the inside of a blood vessel looks like<br>with a bloodless at the bottom and the<br>blood flowing over the top and if there<br>are no signals then the T cell will just<br>go past there's nothing interesting<br>there it'll go past however there are<br>signals that can be placed on this<br>surface that tell the T cell to stop and<br>exit one of these is CCR 21 and this is<br>the one that I'm going to talk about in<br>this presentation so having the CCR 21<br>up there we can now make the T cell come<br>passed it sees the CCR 21 it stops has a<br>bit of a think about its environment and<br>then exits into the tissue beneath so<br>now you've got a t cell in the tissue it<br>can do whatever it's going to do in a<br>tissue a virus or a cancer now this<br>process has been really well defined and<br>we know that the cells can modulate how<br>much CCL 21 they put onto the surface<br>and they can regulate the protein that<br>sticks to well it's there but no one has<br>yet demonstrated a good mechanism for<br>getting rid of the stuff when you're<br>done with that which seems like a bit of<br>a hole in the situation so that's what<br>we set out to solve so we want to ask<br>the question how does the body then<br>regulate the CCR 21 on the endothelium<br>so the hypothesis that the birch lab has<br>been working with is that this enzyme<br>plasma is able to remove this from the<br>surface so placements been known about<br>since the late 60s and it's really<br>important for breaking down blood clots<br>and it does that by cutting up the<br>fibers that hold them together it's what<br>we call a protease a protein that cuts<br>other proteins however more recently<br>it's been shown to have a huge variety<br>of other functions including cleaning up<br>various immune factors so we thought<br>critically you've see Co 21 in the blood<br>where it's normally found this is where<br>this process gets a smidge more<br>complicated because if you had acted<br>plasma your blood you will all be<br>bleeding to death as we speak so it's<br>got to be regulated and the way your<br>body does that is it has this precursor<br>called plasminogen<br>that's bound to the surface and that has<br>been activated by either TPA or EPA<br>which are two factors called tissue<br>plasminogen activator when you're a<br>Chinese plasminogen activator they are<br>produced by cells only when required and<br>they convert plasminogen into active<br>plasma and this whole process so far is<br>very well to find however we<br>hypothesized that this placement within<br>cut the top off the CCR 21 and caused<br>the t-cell to go past so this is what I<br>set out to investigate now in order to<br>do that I did a series of experiments<br>I'm going to talk through those now and<br>show you how he built up this diagram so<br>the first thing we needed to know we've<br>can we have a blood vessel it's really<br>difficult to use a blood vessel in a<br>whole human because you can't see what's<br>going on so we had to grow alone and the<br>way we did this was to use the heme c1<br>cell line this is an immortal ice cell<br>which means it was taken under someone's<br>skin treated with a virus and now we can<br>go it forever now this is a little bit<br>of a dodgy process but it's been really<br>well shown in the literature but this is<br>still effectively a blood vessel so we<br>use this for our study the first<br>experiment we had to do was check that<br>in fact plasminogen could firstly stick<br>to the surface because if it's not such<br>the surface it's gone on the blood flow<br>and secondly that it could be activated<br>so what we did was we bound plasminogen<br>to the surface gave the cells a wash and<br>then headed this activating TPA and as<br>you can see from the graph behind me the<br>cells that received nothing and their<br>cells that received just plasminogen<br>which is the plg absolutely no activity<br>at all and then the cells received TPA<br>showed a significant increase and by<br>measuring this using a special colored<br>substrate over four hours you can see<br>that there is plasminogen activity only<br>when we added TPA and this gave us<br>confidence that we now have a blood<br>vessel in which the placement system is<br>acting as it should the big issue with<br>this essay is to get these nice numbers<br>we just look for a color change in a<br>molecule that gets cut but that's<br>nothing like what CCR 21 looks like so<br>we didn't ask the question<br>can we do the same thing with CCL 21 and<br>to do that we developed an essay called<br>analyzer which allows us to measure the<br>amount of just the top of CCL 21 in a<br>solution so the higher this graph goes<br>the more CTR 21 has been cut off the<br>surface and what you'll notice here is<br>we've got a very similar result of our<br>previous experiment the cells that<br>received just CCL 21 in the blue and the<br>ones that received CCL 21 and<br>plasminogen in the red no significant<br>increase however once we add they're<br>activating factor we immediately see a<br>lot of CCL 21 released within the first<br>four hours so this was the first<br>evidence we had but the whole stack so<br>far was working well now that's all very<br>well but this process only works if you<br>can get a t-cell involved so in order to<br>do that I had to create a slightly more<br>sophisticated blood vessel and the way I<br>did that was I grew my Inlet feeling<br>yourself again on the bottom of these<br>special channels that are about 0.35 of<br>a millimeter across so they're really<br>really quite small the advantage of<br>growing them in this format is I can<br>move very precise amounts of fluid over<br>the surface and I can put t-cells in<br>that fluid so I found a friendly postdoc<br>and we borrowed some of those t-cells<br>and then I stained them bright green so<br>you can see what's going on and if I now<br>play this video you'll notice the<br>t-cells are whipping past I've speed<br>this video up 60 times so it's nice and<br>quick and you can see at the top little<br>green dots starting to stick to that<br>layer of cells and none of the cells are<br>sticking at the bottom now because<br>that's hard to see I've gone through<br>encountered the cells and graphed them<br>and you'll notice that the cells that<br>receive just plasminogen there's no<br>active protease on the surface have<br>significantly more cell sticking than<br>those cells that also had TPA and this<br>lines up with our model and tells us<br>that our whole stack of proteins is<br>working effectively so that's really<br>convincing so now that we've got this<br>system where could we take it from here<br>well we know that this plasminogen<br>system is highly regulated and that this<br>gives us multiple therapeutic options so<br>it's been shown previously that mice<br>that lack<br>TPA this activating factor have more<br>immune cells infiltrating during kidney<br>and liver diseases and Nomikos has been<br>shown for this but our mechanism fits<br>perfectly so that's really convincing<br>secondly it's been shown that pi-1<br>expression is increase in inflammatory<br>diseases and that knocks out the TPA<br>again this could be causing immune<br>inflammation and diseases such as<br>obesity we don't want it in what is<br>effectively a self-perpetuating process<br>so that's another really exciting fun<br>finding and finally we've had drugs that<br>modulate the plasma ligand system for<br>people with clotting diseases for many<br>many years<br>and it's there's a huge potential at<br>these could be repurposed so this<br>morning the Nobel Prize was won for<br>modulating these cells with drugs that<br>hundreds of thousands of dollars<br>potentially we could use drugs that just<br>sit on the Shelf and a very cheap<br>because they use for people by years and<br>years and finally some acknowledgments<br>this research was primarily presented<br>supervised financial birch he sadly<br>passed away about a month ago after a<br>battle with cancer<br>it was also supervised by DJ loaf and<br>I'd like to thank the mr. burch group<br>with a huge support as well as the<br>Graham group the guys who worked the bio<br>flux because it's a bit of a figgity<br>system and the rod number and the mouse<br>and landfill
