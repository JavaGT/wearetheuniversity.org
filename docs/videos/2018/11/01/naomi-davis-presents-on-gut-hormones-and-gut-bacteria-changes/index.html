would like to thank exposure<br>for having me here again tonight and I'm<br>really excited to talk to you for the<br>next ten minutes hopefully about the<br>work that I've been doing for my PhD so<br>the title of my presentation today is<br>comparative gut hormone and gut bacteria<br>changes in patients with type 2 diabetes<br>undergoing sleeve gastrectomy or ruin my<br>gastric bypass or in other words what<br>happens in our gut following bariatric<br>surgery bariatric surgery is currently<br>the recommended treatment for the<br>treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity<br>there are many different types of<br>bariatric surgery available today the<br>two most commonly performed surgeries in<br>New Zealand and worldwide are the Rue<br>and where gastric bypass and the sleeve<br>gastrectomy these procedures are<br>typically performed in about 45 to 49<br>percent of each of all of all procedures<br>both of these procedures result in<br>really significant rates of weight loss<br>sometimes up to 75% excess weight and<br>also really really exciting levels of<br>type 2 diabetes remission so we see<br>roughly 71 to 72 percent diabetes<br>remission in both of these types of<br>surgery and so really what we want to<br>understand is how does the gut<br>physiology differ between people who do<br>remit and people who don't so why is<br>there this 30% who don't remit despite<br>surgery type so apart from the basic<br>anatomical rearrangements to the gut we<br>believe that there are two other<br>mechanisms that contribute to this type<br>2 diabetes' resolution they are changes<br>to gut hormones and changes to the gut<br>bacteria or the bacteria that resides in<br>our gut so as far as the gut hormones we<br>already understand that any changes to<br>the stomach or the gut any anatomical<br>rearrangements is undoubtedly going to<br>have an effect on the hormones proteins<br>and small molecules that are produced in<br>or active in those areas and so this is<br>fairly well understood with bariatric<br>surgery something less well understood<br>is changes to the gut bacteria there<br>have been 14 small studies today looking<br>at chain<br>- gut bacteria following bariatric<br>surgery there are a couple of common<br>themes emerging including things like an<br>increased diversity or richness of the<br>bacteria in the gut following surgery<br>and also a couple of phyla<br>general and species specific changes but<br>based on these studies they're looking<br>at different surgery types different<br>cohorts different disease states and a<br>different length of study period and so<br>it's really hard to understand whether<br>any of these changes are truly causal or<br>truly contributing to type 2 diabetes<br>resolution and so this is what we want<br>to do we want to see if we can pull out<br>something that can be used to have a<br>look at why people do and don't remit<br>from vary from type 2 diabetes so the<br>first thing that we set out to do was<br>first compare and confirm whether these<br>two types of surgery have similar<br>remission rates this is what we have<br>been based on the literature but we<br>wanted to confirm in a single cohort<br>secondly we wanted to have a look at<br>whether this similarity is further<br>elected and similarity to how patients<br>adjust to glucose control and then<br>further their gut bacteria do these<br>things look similar between the two<br>types of surgery or are they different<br>and then finally touching on that final<br>point is can we find something can we<br>pull something out that's going to help<br>us have a look at people who do and<br>don't remit and why this happens so in<br>2011 we embarked on a patient Assessor<br>blinded trial so we were looking at the<br>treatment of the bypass versus the<br>sleeve for the management of diabetes in<br>obese patients so obese patients were<br>with type 2 diabetes diabetes excuse me<br>were recruited they were put on a very<br>low-calorie up to fast diet for two to<br>four weeks prior to surgery and then<br>they were randomized to surgery we saw<br>these patients at two days before<br>surgery one year after surgery and we're<br>now seeing them at five years after<br>surgery at all of these appointments<br>they had a myriad of body composition<br>data taken including heights and weights<br>they also had an oral glucose tolerance<br>test which I'll touch on in a minute and<br>they gave a fecal sample for microbial<br>DNA analysis so firstly I just want to<br>touch on my first<br>Shayne's which were confirming that<br>these diabetes remission rates are<br>similar how glucose control looks<br>following surgery and so what we see in<br>a nutshell with diabetes remission is we<br>see it it is similar there's no<br>difference between the two types of<br>surgery and it's also quite clearly if<br>not maybe a little bit better reflecting<br>what we had seen in the literature so<br>one year following surgery we're seeing<br>72 to 75 percent of our patients are<br>emitting from diabetes<br>what about glucose control so this data<br>was obtained from the oral glucose<br>tolerance test at time zero our<br>participants are given 75 grams of<br>glucose in a drink and then we take<br>Bloods for two hours following that a<br>couple of key things here the green is<br>representing the bypass group and the<br>blue is representing the sleeve these<br>two little red lines are indicating<br>thresholds that are telling us about the<br>glucose control of the participants so<br>typically patients with diabetes will<br>have a fasting glucose or a basal<br>glucose level before eating of over<br>seven millimole we also see that after<br>two hours of a glucose drink their<br>glucose is sitting much higher than 11.1<br>so these are key indicators of<br>inadequate glucose control and this is<br>what we see in our participants<br>pre-surgery so what about following<br>surgery this is what we see so the first<br>thing to point out is that all of our<br>participants are sitting below seven<br>millimole at fasting which is great<br>we're also seeing at the two-hour mark<br>they're sitting below 11.1 dilemma so<br>this is representing the adequate<br>glucose control so if glucose control<br>has been restored the really exciting<br>thing here is this insulin so what we<br>see is the insulin is rushing in<br>following the glucose drink it says<br>quick quick get out of here glucose so<br>it sends the glucose to different organs<br>different tissues and gets it out of the<br>blood which is why you see that the<br>glucose is significantly reduced at two<br>hours in the following surgery and the<br>in the bold lines and so this is this is<br>exciting this is telling us that yes we<br>do see this glucose restoration but we<br>already knew that we knew this from the<br>literature we just wanted to see whether<br>the groups are the same and they are<br>so what about the gut microbiota<br>specifically does do the changes to<br>other changes to the gut microbiota do<br>they look the same between surgery types<br>and is there a difference between<br>patients who do on don't remit and so<br>this graph is all of our participants<br>who did remit from diabetes following<br>each surgery type so this is the seventy<br>percent roughly of our patients on the<br>left you can see the bypass on the right<br>you have the sleeve group and although<br>you probably can't read all of the words<br>what you can see is that there are<br>different changes so the red bars are<br>indicating increased bacterial taxes so<br>this is over a specific species or a<br>family or something something specific<br>that's coming out green is representing<br>a decrease and you can say that the to<br>surgery types are both having increases<br>and decreases but they're a bit<br>different but what's really exciting is<br>this rose barrier intercept of Alice so<br>this is a specific species or group of<br>species that is significantly increased<br>in patients who do remit from diabetes<br>regardless of surgery type so we thought<br>this is great<br>this is interesting what about<br>participants who don't remit from<br>diabetes which brings me to this graph<br>so it's the same graph red is an<br>increase Green is a decrease and this is<br>everybody who didn't remit from diabetes<br>as a group we don't see any rose bjur<br>increasing in fact what we see is a<br>decrease in Rose barrier species<br>following surgery so this is interesting<br>this is something that's starkly<br>different between the groups and so we<br>wanted to know what is rose barrier rose<br>Berea is a butyrate producing bacteria<br>it's typical in a healthy gut so people<br>who have looked at healthy guts have<br>seen a lot of Rose barrier we know that<br>it is positive sociated with weight loss<br>and improved glucose tolerance and we<br>also know that it has other beneficial<br>roles in the body such as influencing<br>colonic motility and so what we want to<br>what we want to do now is take this is<br>changing or as bureau the difference in<br>rose barrier that we've observed and see<br>whether it relates back to any of our<br>other clinical indices that we have<br>or can we even use rez birria as a<br>probiotic for these patients pre-post or<br>during surgery so in a nutshell<br>probiotics are live bacterium that taken<br>at large doses in for health benefits<br>typically they include things like<br>Bifidobacterium and lactobacillus which<br>are known to impart various different<br>health health benefits such as producing<br>vitamins for the body and regulating<br>levels of other bacterium so can we use<br>rose birria is there that is there<br>somewhere that we can slot Rosie are you<br>into this and it turns out there's a lot<br>of hype about this already so there are<br>several patents filed better looking at<br>the use of Rose birria for the treatment<br>of obesity and its associated diseases<br>so this is exciting so to wrap it all up<br>is diabetes remission similar yes is the<br>similarity also reflected in changes to<br>glucose control yes what about the gut<br>bacteria we saw some discordant changes<br>but really really exciting Lee we saw<br>this rose birria coming up and<br>specifically we saw it coming out in<br>patients who did remit from diabetes<br>regardless of surgery type but not in<br>patients who didn't so I just want to<br>wrap up and thank everybody who's<br>participated especially my especially my<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
