and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening I'm Vishal Kamaraju and I'm<br>a PhD student at the libyans Institute<br>I'm interested in studying reproductive<br>biology with a specific focus on the<br>endometrium today I would like to tell<br>you a little bit about tetes and their<br>role in the endometrium now before I<br>start with steps I would like to explain<br>what is the endometrium the endometrium<br>is the innermost lining of the uterus or<br>the womb it is the only tissue in the<br>human body that has the ability to shed<br>regenerate and differentiate in a<br>controlled and cyclic manner each month<br>this unique capacity is a fundamental<br>requirement for a successful pregnancy<br>however if there is no pregnancy this<br>tissue sheds leaving the body during<br>period and the whole cycle starts all<br>over again<br>did you know an average woman spends<br>around 3000 and 500 days of her life<br>menstruating the menstrual cycle is<br>guided by two main hormones estrogen and<br>progesterone these two work in a<br>synchronized manner to degenerate the<br>upper layer leaving behind a lower layer<br>this lower layer begins to regenerate in<br>the proliferative phase this makes up<br>for the first half of the menstrual<br>cycle the proliferative phase begins<br>upon e sturgeon influx which allows the<br>endometrium to grow and prepares it for<br>the second phase which is the secretory<br>phase during this phase progesterone is<br>the dominating hormone and it works with<br>lower levels of estrogen progesterone<br>diminishes Easter genic activity and it<br>stops the endometrium from growing<br>thereby allowing a structural change<br>this prepares the endometrium to receive<br>an embryo if there is no embryo or<br>pregnancy there is a steep decline in<br>both these hormones that triggers the<br>menstrual bleed now there are several<br>mechanisms that are required to maintain<br>these fluctuating hormonal levels and<br>most of these we do not have a very<br>clear understanding<br>one such mechanism is epigenetics<br>epigenetics literally means above or on<br>top of genetics this means that these<br>changes do not affect the sequence but<br>only the confirmation let's take a look<br>at this for a minute this represents DNA<br>that is intricately wrapped around and<br>within parts of this DNA like your genes<br>this entire unit is present in every<br>cell of the body so then how do your<br>eyes know what they should do or your<br>liver know what it should do it is<br>because depending on the location there<br>are certain genes that are active and<br>certain genes that are inactive<br>epigenetics work as chemical tanks they<br>attach themselves to certain parts of<br>the sequence opening the structure<br>thereby allowing factors to access the<br>gene these factors tell the gene what<br>they should do where they should do why<br>they should do it and how they should do<br>it<br>if these factors reach the gene this<br>makes the gene active in certain cases<br>these chemical tags tighten the<br>structure thereby making this gene<br>inaccessible and inactive epigenetics is<br>a very dynamic process this means that<br>these chemical tags can be influenced by<br>environment lifestyle diet and hormones<br>but what makes them interesting is that<br>they are reversible which means that<br>they can be used as potential targets<br>for drug discovery now there are several<br>ways through which epigenetic marks act<br>and two of which that I am going to be<br>discussing today is the any metal Asian<br>and hydroxy methylation speaking of DNA<br>methylation DNA methylation is a process<br>that involves attaching a methyl group<br>to a certain site on the DNA sequence<br>this tightens the structure making a<br>gene inactive these are driven by DNA<br>DNA methyltransferases often known as DN<br>empties and is often associated with<br>gene silencing now a classic example of<br>DNA methylation is that a bootie mice<br>just by looking at these two can you<br>telda they're identical twins agouti is<br>a gene that adds skin color in one mouse<br>this gene is active or expressed this<br>makes this mouse yellowish in color<br>fatter and more prone to diabetes as<br>well as cancer whereas in this mouse<br>only this gene is inactive<br>this makes the mouse healthier browner<br>and leaner now just think about this if<br>methylation pattern of one gene can do<br>so much to the body how much does a<br>combined methylation factor of all the<br>genes have on the body now coming back<br>to the endometrium current literature<br>suggests abnormal methylation patterns<br>are linked with several disease states<br>the nm T's are known to be over<br>expressed in the endometrium and in<br>disease states such as endometrial<br>cancer and endometriosis since the<br>menstrual cycle is an extremely dynamic<br>process we wanted to see how the enemies<br>are expressed throughout it we found out<br>that the nm T's are upregulated in the<br>proliferative phase or the first half of<br>the cycle so far we've understood a<br>little bit about methylation we know<br>that it is associated with gene<br>silencing recently another epigenetic<br>mark has come to light called hydroxy<br>methylation this involves attaching a<br>hydroxyl group to the same site on the<br>DNA sequence as methylation targets now<br>structurally they are very very similar<br>but functionally hydroxy methylation<br>activates gene so now there's the DNA<br>sequence and there is one site on the<br>DNA sequence that these two epigenetic<br>tags want to come and target this makes<br>it really difficult for identification<br>techniques to actually distinguish<br>between these two epigenetic marks<br>thereby limiting our understanding of<br>this process hydroxyl methylation is<br>driven by tet or 10 11 translocation<br>proteins<br>currently there are three don't text at<br>one tattoo and dead three these three<br>have been known to play a role in the<br>female reproductive tract but its exact<br>role in the endometrium remains<br>unexplored this brings me to the aim of<br>my study which was to characterize the<br>distribu<br>of deaths throughout the endometrium and<br>to understand the regulation of death in<br>individual cell types upon exposure to<br>hormones in order to do that we divided<br>a study into two parts for the clinical<br>aspect we recruited healthy fertile<br>reproductive aged women and extracted<br>endometrial biopsies these biopsies were<br>then graded depending upon the menstrual<br>cycle phases they were collected in we<br>then used experimental and statistical<br>tools to determine Tet expression<br>throughout the cycle since the<br>endometrium consists of two main cell<br>types epithelial and stromal we wanted<br>to see how debts are expressed<br>differentially in these two cell lines<br>so we use healthy animal cell lines and<br>treated them individually with<br>east-asian progesterone and a combined<br>instrument progesterone treatment we<br>then again used experimental and<br>statistical tools to determine that<br>expression in these two cell lines the<br>first part of our study revealed that<br>deaths are upregulated or active in the<br>second half of the cycle now this<br>implies that menstrual cycle phases<br>actually influences gene activity and it<br>can also be correlated to the previous<br>data that was d NM T's that drive<br>methylation and are expressed or active<br>in the proliferative phase further we<br>also saw that in cell types epithelial<br>cells that are predominantly found to at<br>the outer part of the endometrium Dex<br>were upregulated upon progesterone<br>treatment whereas in stromal cells that<br>are found deeper within the tissue<br>deaths were seen to be upregulated by<br>East urgent treatment this part of the<br>study highlights the fact that even<br>though the endometrium is one whole<br>tissue it does contain different cell<br>types that actually behave very<br>differently<br>that's concluding the endometrium is a<br>dynamic tissue that is constantly<br>changing deaths are not only active or<br>expressed in the endometrium but are<br>also up regulated during the secretory<br>phase<br>lastly deaths are also seen to be<br>differentially in endometrial cell types<br>so that they come from this talk is that<br>menstrual cycle phases and cell types<br>are extremely essential covariates that<br>need to be taken into consideration<br>while conducting endometrial studies in<br>the future<br>we aim to see her aberrant methylation<br>and hydroxy methylation patterns could<br>contribute to diseases such as<br>endometriosis I would like to<br>acknowledge my supervisor dr. Anna and<br>everybody else who was a part of the<br>study and a big thank you to all of you<br>for listening that would be</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
