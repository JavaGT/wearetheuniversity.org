The University of Otago, in association with the Otago Museum and Victoria University of Wellington is delivering a series of talks throughout the country dedicated to this topic.<br>For more information: https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/events/otago697419.html</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>space weather is how the Sun impacts our<br>human technology these vital things that<br>we use to live on a day-to-day basis and<br>when we think about space weather and<br>the damage side we can think about the<br>wreck damage to electrical networks<br>which could cook in extreme cases lead<br>to blackouts we can think about<br>disruptions to GPS navigation systems so<br>that they aren't telling us where we are<br>and when we are it can lead to increased<br>radiation doses to passengers flying in<br>high altitude planes over the poles<br>well I'm an astronomer and I'm an Aurora<br>chaser and in this talk I'll be showing<br>you some of the amazing Aurora's that<br>you can see from southern New Zealand<br>and I'll explain how you can photograph<br>them for yourself space weather is<br>something that we can directly see here<br>on earth and the beautiful phenomenon<br>that we see across southern New Zealand<br>the Aurora Australis is a direct<br>consequence of what's going on the Sun<br>and the interaction between the Sun and<br>the earth space weather can have struck<br>technological systems such as power<br>transmission networks but what else can<br>affect very gas and oil pipelines are<br>protected from corrosion should their<br>coating get broken by what's referred to<br>as a cathodic protection system<br>but space weather can override cathodic<br>protection and allow corrosion to occur<br>if the insulating coating gets broken<br>the rupture of the Auckland aviation<br>fuel pipeline last year was ultimately<br>due to a mechanical digger damaging the<br>coating and scraping the pipe but did<br>space weather contribute to the<br>subsequent corrosion<br>these are big picture effects they're<br>not commonly what engineers call a high<br>impact low probability but just like<br>earthquakes and volcanoes we need more</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
