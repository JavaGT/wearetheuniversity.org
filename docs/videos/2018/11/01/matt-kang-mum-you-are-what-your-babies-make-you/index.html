of medical and Health<br>Sciences first I'd like to thank<br>exposure for giving me a chance for<br>seniority and organizing this fantastic<br>event I'm grateful to be here and today<br>my story will be on that moms you make<br>us but did you also know that we make<br>you now I'm gonna begin my slide with<br>the introduction of the chimera so in<br>Greek mythology a chimera is a hybrid<br>creature depicted as a fire-breathing<br>lion with a head of a goat on its back<br>and a snake for sale now the ancient<br>Greeks they were definitely onto<br>something because it happens that this<br>isn't just a figment of imagination it<br>actually happens in real life during<br>pregnancy now we call this chimeras in<br>fetal chimerism ie baby commerson<br>and it is described here here that<br>people baby materials pass into the<br>mother's body during pregnancy what's<br>even more fascinating is that this same<br>people materials can be seen detected in<br>the mother decades after or even<br>throughout the lifetime of the mother<br>after giving birth to the baby now<br>although there is no fly breathing<br>involved this is really heavily<br>fascinating stuff from a biological and<br>hopefully from an audience point of view<br>because fetal conversion has been<br>correlated to a diverse list of health<br>effects and mother's for example the<br>presence of fetal chimera in the<br>mother's body has been correlated to<br>protection such as increase in wound<br>healing protection against breast cancer<br>as well as increased protection against<br>Alzheimer's disease however it's not<br>always sunshine and rainbows because it<br>has also been correlated to negative<br>effects as well such as increase in the<br>risk of colon cancer as well as<br>Parkinson's just name a few now these<br>are some serious health implications and<br>there's actually been a lot of research<br>effort in the past to try and identify<br>and investigate the correlation between<br>feeding chimerism and how these diverse<br>health effects are coming about however<br>many possible still remain unanswered<br>and most of it is so shrouded in mystery<br>until now so in my PhD we try to tackle<br>this mystery by providing an explanation<br>of our own as to how this might be<br>occurring so in my PhD we hypothesize<br>that you're in pregnancy the placenta<br>releases vesicles that contain fetal DNA<br>directly into the mother's sick blood<br>circulation here<br>the stent delivers into the mother's<br>cell creating fetal commerson now to<br>better understand this hypothesis I'm<br>gonna break it down into three parts<br>first part I'll be talking about the<br>placenta second the DNA and then finally<br>I'll be touching upon vesicles so at the<br>core hypothesis involves the organ<br>called the placenta and here is a<br>depiction of the fetus and the placenta<br>typically in red inside the mother's<br>womb during pregnancy now the placenta<br>is an organ that develops during<br>pregnancy and it's a transient organ<br>that resides for around eight to nine<br>months in the pregnant mother now the<br>most obvious functions would include<br>delivery of nutrients the baby as well<br>as allowing the baby to breathe fun fact<br>of the day is that this organ is<br>actually a part of the growing fetus and<br>not the mother therefore it follows that<br>it contains fetal DNA only so then what<br>is DNA well we might be more familiar<br>with DNA from TV forensic shows like CSI<br>Miami bones or even Jurassic Park and<br>the common theme in all of these TV<br>heads is that DNA is the blueprint of<br>life and that each individual contains a<br>unique DNA sequence so this is basically<br>what a DNA looks like a twisted up<br>letter and to describe the function of<br>the DNA I like to bring in the book<br>analogy using this analogy each bar of<br>the letter represents a single letter of<br>the alphabet we call this base pair in<br>biology right so it doesn't mean<br>anything it doesn't have any function<br>however if the DNA is long enough it'll<br>code for multiple and we'll cover<br>multiple letters of the alphabet that<br>combine to form a comprehensive word now<br>we call this gene therefore it follows<br>that the entire DNA sequence whole form<br>the story of the book ie the individual<br>you<br>so then where is DNA located so here is<br>a simple depiction of a cell in your<br>body and DNA should be located in almost<br>every cell in your body now I'm gonna<br>bring in another analogy here I like to<br>represent the cell as being a computer<br>and in human blood circulation as being<br>the Internet now both the cell and the<br>computer they perform many different<br>functions one of which is the transfer<br>of information from one computer to<br>another to do this they must access<br>Internet and they send out something<br>like emails it is essentially the same<br>in your human body we are for one cell<br>to communicate with a different cell in<br>different part of the body our cells<br>will produce and release what is called<br>vesicles in their surrounding that end<br>up in the blood circulation so this<br>brings us to our final part of our<br>hypothesis vesicles so in this analogy<br>vesicles can be seen as very tiny<br>biological emails again they're very<br>tiny around 100 to 1000 nanometers in<br>diameter and in the past the side of the<br>community has always regarded vesicles<br>as nothing more than rubbish ie junk<br>mail relevant in the last decade or so<br>tremendous amount of evidence has<br>emerged showing that these vessels<br>actually carry quite valuable biological<br>cargo or information in the form of<br>let's say an email attachment and this<br>is what allows for communication between<br>cells and different part of the body now<br>the placenta is an extraordinary organ<br>it releases truckloads of these vesicles<br>directly pumping it out into the<br>material mother's blood stream and if<br>these vesicles from the placenta did<br>have an email address it'll look<br>something like this vesicles at placenta<br>dot NZ and in my PhD we are the person<br>propose that these placental vesicles<br>contain fetal DNA as it's biological I<br>mean as this email attachment so here is<br>a quick cartoon to illustrate how this<br>all happens overall we'd begin with a<br>pregnant mother with the fetus typically<br>here as green again we see that fetus<br>and the placenta depicted here as red<br>now the placenta produces vesicles that<br>contain fetal DNA like so and this is<br>then released into the mother's blood<br>stream<br>it travels about in some of these<br>vesicles may make its way to a local<br>mother cell here they are eaten up body<br>cells with potential transfer of the<br>fetal DNA content carried in these<br>vesicles into the mother cell's DNA<br>thereby creating people carnism and<br>depending on the different parts of the<br>fetal DNA that has being transferred we<br>propose that different outcomes may<br>arise so let's say for example the<br>transfer fetal DNA depicted here as<br>yellow happens to be a tumor suppressor<br>gene then this may lead to reduce risk<br>of cancer and mother's let's say if it<br>happened to be a blood vessel formation<br>gene this will lead to an increase in<br>blood vessel formation and therefore<br>increase our aid in maternal and<br>mother's wound-healing<br>so this brings us to the first part of<br>my first aim of my project which was to<br>determine if fetal DNA really was<br>present in my physical samples released<br>by the placenta and if so in how much<br>quantity so here is my method we begin<br>with a placenta we put it into a insert<br>system which allows us to collect the<br>falling vesicles from the overlaying<br>tissue and then we collect out our<br>solution that now contains these<br>population of vesicles we then extract<br>the DNA from it and here is my welfare<br>code this data shows that total quantity<br>of fetal DNA carried in vesicles<br>released by the placenta every single<br>day now this data not only shows that<br>fetal DNA is indeed present in these<br>vesicles but they are present in extreme<br>abundance in fact the placenta releases<br>17 milligrams of foreign cell free<br>foreign fetal DNA the Republic it<br>directly into the mother's blood every<br>single day through our pregnancy now<br>it's 17 milligrams a large amount of DNA<br>well this is equivalent to the DNA<br>amount of 3 million cells so the answer<br>is yes this is quite a considerable<br>amount of foreign DNA that is<br>continuously circulating about in the<br>mother circulation and potentially<br>exposing the mother our mother mother's<br>body cells so following on from this I<br>had one concern was that vesicles were<br>quite tiny so the question now was that<br>these fetal DNA carried in these tiny<br>placental physical<br>still be long enough to code for<br>functional genes ie could they code for<br>a comprehensive work using the poking<br>ology of the DNA and this brings us to<br>my second aim to determine the length of<br>the people DNA carried in these<br>placental vesicles and here is that<br>result we see that very clearly that<br>placenta vesicles are more than capable<br>of holding a DNA size of around 20,000<br>base pairs now as three thousand base<br>pairs long enough to code for a<br>meaningful or a functional gene well<br>given that the average human gene length<br>is around 8,500 base pairs the answer is<br>definitely yes<br>twenty thousand base pairs is definitely<br>long enough Kirk well not just one but<br>potentially multiple human people genes<br>so in conclusion number one people DNA<br>is indeed present in placenta vesicles<br>in extreme abundance number two fetal<br>DNA in pleasanton vesicles are long<br>enough increasing the likelihood of<br>carrying functional genes combine<br>preliminary data suggests if functional<br>fetal genes could potentially be<br>delivered via vesicles into the mother<br>cells essentially morphing the mother<br>into a hybrid chimera with more than one<br>individuals DNA there for moms you are<br>what your babies make you so I'd like to<br>thank the following parties and people<br>for making this project possible<br>of course my
