0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening everyone I'm the cake<br>Mackrell I'm a PhD candidate in health<br>psychology from the Faculty of medical<br>and Health Sciences and today I'm<br>talking about how media coverage of a<br>drugs which can influence side affect<br>reporting but first I'd like to clarify<br>side effects you see side effects are<br>not always due to the chemical<br>components of the drug they can also be<br>induced through psychological processes<br>when a person expects to get side<br>effects this increases their bodily<br>awareness they start to notice various<br>physical sensations and then must<br>attribute benign transient symptoms to a<br>drug so this phenomenon was first<br>demonstrated and randomized control drug<br>trials where the placebo group also<br>reported side effects after taking an<br>inert tablet this response has become<br>known as the nocebo effect and research<br>has shown that the media can influence<br>people's expectations about the<br>experience and likelihood of side<br>effects for example there's been quite a<br>lot of media coverage on statins and<br>their apparent association with muscle<br>memory but on randomized controlled<br>trials of statin therapy when<br>participants are blinded two treatment<br>group they don't report muscle pain but<br>as soon as they're told they're in<br>statin group there's a sudden increase<br>in muscle related side effects so with<br>this in mind I want to talk about the<br>New Zealand venlafaxine brands which<br>serve in the faxing is a last line<br>antidepressant for treatment-resistant<br>depression there are currently 45<br>thousand New Zealanders taking been<br>effects seen and for the past three<br>years Pharma has wondered two types of<br>the semitic ation there's a fixer<br>Pfizer's original branded version and a<br>generic Caldera vela faxing but in 2017<br>through a competitor<br>tinder process the funded brand has<br>changed to another generic Allah facts<br>made by Milan the aim of the switch was<br>to save 19 million dollars over five<br>years and these savings would be used to<br>fund other medicines so these three<br>drugs all contain the active ingredient<br>venlafaxine and have been approved by<br>mid safe as being bioequivalent meaning<br>they have the same efficacy safety in<br>side effects so the only difference with<br>ill effects compared to the other two<br>that it has a different name and it's<br>made by a different company so one could<br>assume that this would have been a<br>relatively simple switch but people with<br>depression could be considered a more<br>vulnerable group as research has shown<br>they're more susceptible to the nocebo<br>effect and following the venlafaxine<br>switch some people did have an adverse<br>response and this was picked up by the<br>media on February 28th this year both<br>the New Zealand Herald and stuff online<br>released an article which discussed in<br>detail the specific experience of two<br>patients the New Zealand Herald also<br>listed the side-effects there have been<br>reported following the switch to end<br>effects most notably that this drug<br>wasn't working and there was an increase<br>in suicidal thoughts a few months later<br>stuff released another article which<br>continued this discussion about people<br>who negative experiences with in effects<br>so I colleagues and I conducted a study<br>to examine the effect of this media<br>coverage on people's side effect reports<br>and the best way to do that was to look<br>at reports to the Center for adverse<br>reactions monitoring or can a New<br>Zealand - bass that records side effect<br>complaints we also investigated whether<br>the side effects mint<br>in the media increased in frequency<br>compared to side effects that weren't<br>mentioned so to investigate these aims<br>we analyzed the monthly adverse reaction<br>reports for ill effects from October<br>2017 through to July 2018 our data of<br>interest were the number of decreased<br>therapeutic response reports this is<br>another way of saying that drugs doesn't<br>work we also investigated the total<br>number of side effects reported each<br>month and the number of times the media<br>mentioned side effects reported and five<br>equally common side effects not<br>mentioned in the media and since the<br>media coverage was released at the end<br>of February and April we compared the<br>March and May averages for these<br>outcomes with their pre media monthly<br>average using an interrupted time series<br>analysis so there are a hundred adverse<br>event reports in this time 70% of<br>reporters were female and the average<br>well there was a sudden increase in<br>adverse event reporting in the months<br>directly after the media coverage there<br>was a significant increase in the<br>reports of decreased therapeutic<br>response with an interruption effect of<br>fifteen point four nine meaning the<br>difference between the pre media average<br>and the March and May average the number<br>of side effects reported also increased<br>going from an average of seven per month<br>before the media focus to 65 in March<br>and 33 in May and we're looking at the<br>specific side effect mentioned in the<br>media all apart from fatigue and anxiety<br>significantly increased but the greatest<br>change was for suicidal thoughts however<br>there was very little change and the<br>side effects not mentioned in the media<br>only dizziness seem to have a slight<br>crease so from these results we can see<br>that the media coverage of the<br>venlafaxine brand switch was associated<br>with a large increase in side-effects<br>and reports of decreased therapeutic<br>response and ultimately the side-effects<br>mentioned in the media increased more<br>than side-effects that weren't mentioned<br>these results show the nocebo effect and<br>action and how the media can influence<br>people's expectations about the<br>experience of side effects from this<br>drug despite it being bio equivalent to<br>their previous medication however it<br>should be noted that this is a snapshot<br>of adverse event reporting these are the<br>people who voluntarily reported to come<br>so these results probably don't capture<br>the full extent of the nocebo effect and<br>we also don't know the outcomes or the<br>consequences of his adverse event<br>reports but from the study we can see<br>that the nocebo effect can be<br>transmitted to a wide range of people<br>very quickly and very easily through the<br>media we know from past research that<br>the nocebo effect is associated with non<br>adherence to medical treatment so that<br>is a likely consequence in this case<br>keeping in mind that this is an<br>antidepressant and as we saw in the<br>results the side effect that increased<br>the most was suicidal thoughts which is<br>extremely concerning so what can be done<br>well I'll leave you with two thoughts<br>firstly from the media side of things<br>there needs to be more balanced<br>reporting in the villa facts in case the<br>media focused on two patients out of<br>45,000 so it's probably necessary to<br>acknowledge that not everyone has or<br>will experience these side effects we<br>could also educate the public about the<br>nocebo effect<br>see people know a lot about placebo but<br>nocebo is relatively unknown we could<br>use the media to spread information<br>given its wide reach and finally to us<br>this may have seemed like a simple<br>Midland switch but some people<br>particularly those with depression are<br>more sensitive to mid some changes and<br>need greater support managing this<br>process the support should have come<br>from their health care professionals<br>their doctors pharmacists the<br>gatekeepers of the medication and not<br>the media thank
