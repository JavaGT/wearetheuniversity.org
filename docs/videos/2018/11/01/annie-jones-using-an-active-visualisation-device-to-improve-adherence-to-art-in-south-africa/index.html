a<br>study that I've conducted as part of my<br>PhD thesis and health psychology so this<br>is a study where we looked at using an<br>active visualization device to try and<br>improve adherence to antiretroviral<br>therapy within South Africa before I<br>move on to talk about the study that we<br>conducted I thought I'd give a bit of<br>background about my PhD topic so my<br>thesis is looking at this idea of<br>visualization and how we can use<br>visualizations of medical disease and<br>treatment to improve adherence so the<br>idea here is that we show patients<br>what's going on inside their body both<br>in terms of how the illness might have<br>occurred but also how treatment might<br>help to try and control that so we do<br>that through using a number of things<br>such as 3d modeling or animations images<br>that can show patients these processes<br>that are occurring inside more recently<br>we've been interested in this concept<br>called active visualization so the<br>distinction here is that instead of<br>using these static kind of images or 3d<br>models we instead use animations or even<br>live demonstrations and the idea here is<br>that these things can actually show more<br>of a process of what's going on inside<br>the body instead of just a still<br>snapshot of one point in time so we use<br>one of these active visualizations<br>within the study that I'm going to talk<br>about today and this is the device in<br>certain stages as we were going through<br>development what it ended up looking<br>like was this picture here so it's<br>basically a human shaped body made of<br>perspex and what we wanted to do was to<br>really clearly demonstrate what happens<br>when patients take their enter each of<br>our therapy versus when they don't and<br>unlike other treatments with<br>antiretroviral therapy if patients don't<br>adhere the treatment actually becomes<br>less effective over time so we have this<br>liquid inside which is pink and we say<br>that that represents the presence of the<br>virus within the body and we change the<br>color of the liquid inside from pink to<br>clear<br>we do that through changing the pH<br>balance of the liquid inside so we add<br>in a tablet that represents their<br>medicine but it's actually just an<br>aspirin tablet so the body always starts<br>pink and we explain that this represents<br>the prison<br>of your HIV infection however when you<br>take your tablet each day this fizzes<br>around and the liquid inside eventually<br>turns clear this represents that the HIV<br>viral load is under control and it's not<br>able to replicate so that's what occurs<br>on day one but we wanted to explain the<br>purpose of consistent adherence over<br>time so even though on day one your<br>viral load is under control because<br>you've taken your medicine on day two<br>you then need to take it again so we add<br>in some more of this virus solution<br>which changes the color inside back to<br>pink and then again we add another<br>tablet that fizzes around and changes it<br>back to clear so helping patients to<br>understand that the infection isn't<br>reversible but by taking the medicine<br>each day they can control the level of<br>viral load inside their body we've<br>ensured patients what happens if they<br>are consistently not adherent over time<br>so they keep missing doses over and over<br>again and we just have our virus<br>solution going into the body the color<br>inside becomes more and more and more<br>pink and this time when the person<br>forgets sorry remembers to take their<br>medicine it's dropped into the body and<br>it fizzes around but the color remains<br>pink so helping patients to understand<br>that if they consistently must doses<br>their treatments actually going to<br>become an effective at controlling the<br>level of virus within their body that<br>was a pretty quick run-through of the<br>methodology we use but we have published<br>this editorial which does explain it in<br>a bit more detail and aids and behavior<br>so moving on to the randomized<br>controlled trial this was a study that<br>we conducted as I mentioned in South<br>Africa and we wanted to use this device<br>to see if we could improve adherence<br>within a group of non-adherent patients<br>and our primary outcome measure here was<br>change and viral load which we measured<br>from looking at patient's blood tests so<br>if viral load should decrease as<br>patients are more adherent to their<br>treatment that's kind of the direct<br>association between those two things<br>just a bit about the context so we<br>conducted the study in collaboration<br>with Stellenbosch University that's<br>about 30 minutes outside of Cape Town in<br>South Africa and you can see here the<br>kinds of clinics that we were working in<br>are quite different what we might see<br>when we're working within clinics here<br>in New Zealand and of course South<br>Africa has a very large HIV epidemic and<br>the number one reason for treatment<br>failure is actually non adherence to<br>treatment the study itself we ended up<br>recruiting a hundred and eleven HIV<br>patients so these were patients who are<br>failing on the original one or two<br>treatment and they recruited from two<br>sites a period urban hospital and a<br>community clinic they completed a<br>baseline assessment and then we<br>randomized into one of two conditions<br>the control and intervention group I<br>just thought I'd point out that in this<br>context standard care which was received<br>by all participants includes adherence<br>counseling so that's the doctor actually<br>talking to the patient about their non<br>adherence explaining the problems with<br>it and trying to encourage them to<br>change their behavior so all patients<br>receive that but our intervention<br>patients also saw our active<br>visualization device and we collected<br>follow-up data anywhere from two months<br>after they saw the intervention and then<br>retrospectively went back and got a<br>baseline level of viral load from their<br>blood test data as well just a bit about<br>the sample I think it's important to<br>point out the differences between our<br>sample and what we might see if we were<br>working within chronic illness here in<br>New Zealand and that's really a quite<br>low level of education a high rate of<br>unemployment and low levels of monthly<br>family income so it's a really low<br>socio-economic status group and I think<br>that's something to remember and when<br>thinking about working within this<br>context so moving on to the results this<br>was our primary outcome change in viral<br>load over time from baseline to<br>follow-up and this is the raw level of<br>viral load within their blood test so<br>you can see here that the intervention<br>condition decreases significantly more<br>than the control group<br>over time you can see however that these<br>numbers are really large when you look<br>at what viral load is and how it's<br>calculated so more commonly we report<br>the log transformed score which is an<br>expression of these numbers to the power<br>of 10 you can see here again that the<br>intervention condition significantly<br>sorry marginally significantly improved<br>at 0.06 versus the control group and<br>that's actually a clinically significant<br>reduction so any change of 0.5 or more<br>and log viral load is associated with a<br>30% decrease and the risk of clinical<br>progression and I think it's important<br>the games remember that we'd expect<br>everyone to get better because everyone<br>had adherence counseling but it's great<br>that our brief intervention was able to<br>improve it to a clinically significant<br>amount even above that and just a bit of<br>psychological data that we collect we<br>always ask our participants what foots<br>ran through your mind when you saw the<br>device obviously these things are quite<br>abstract so it's interesting to see the<br>ideas that people take away and we<br>coated these thoughts and found that<br>more than half of the sample actually<br>had a thought relating to adherence<br>which was really good they were taking<br>away the message that we wanted them to<br>so thoughts such as my adherence<br>beforehand was poor I now see how<br>important the treatment is so that was<br>really encouraging to see what can we<br>conclude from the study well our device<br>was highly accepted and it seems to<br>highlight the importance of adherence to<br>our group of participants our device was<br>brief portable and it's very easy to use<br>and it's resulted in a clinically<br>significant change in viral load for<br>this really high need group of<br>non-adherent patients within this<br>context of South Africa there are of<br>course some limitations to what we found<br>the first would be the viral load data<br>that we had available and this was quite<br>messy we just looked at the records that<br>patients had from naturally coming in<br>and having their routine blood test<br>appointments of course they meant there<br>was a lot of missing data and a lot of<br>variability and when they actually<br>showed up for testing but we figured<br>that was better and less influential<br>than asking them to come in and have<br>another blood test which could also be<br>interfering what their behavior change<br>that we want to see there may have been<br>other contextual factors going on that<br>affected patients adherence to<br>appointments and here adherence to the<br>medicine as well and they may have been<br>language barriers as our session was<br>only conducted in Afrikaans and English<br>I think there are significant strengths<br>of our study though and one would be<br>that ecological validity so we went into<br>this context and we delivered the<br>session alongside the patient's speaking<br>to their doctor so it could easily be<br>incorporated into standard care as a<br>sort of adjunct to this adherence<br>counseling where do we go from here well<br>I think there's a lot of applications<br>for this device it could be used at<br>treatment<br>initiation so helping patients to<br>understand the need for treatment in the<br>first place so they don't become<br>non-adherent it could be used with<br>children it's a nice easy educational<br>tool to understand it's quite difficult<br>and abstract process with pregnant women<br>so they understand the need to be<br>adherent to their treatment and they<br>don't pass on infection to their unborn<br>child and obviously it could be used<br>within remote communities which is<br>really important within South Africa it<br>doesn't rely upon technology it's very<br>cheap which means it could be taken to<br>these hard-to-reach communities and<br>there is also some application to use<br>this device within prep so to help<br>patients to understand the purpose of<br>pre exposure prophylaxis which helps to<br>prevent HIV infection from being<br>contracted so that's all from me just<br>some acknowledgments to my supervisors<br>our collaborators at Stellenbosch<br>University and some other people who are<br>individually who are instrumental sorry<br>and helping us create this device thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
