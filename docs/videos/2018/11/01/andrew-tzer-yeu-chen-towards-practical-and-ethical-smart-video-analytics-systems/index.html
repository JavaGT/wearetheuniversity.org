sciences so I'd<br>like to share some of my PhD research<br>with you tonight around creating a<br>practical and ethical smart video<br>analytics system and you might be<br>thinking to yourself what is a video<br>analytics system at this point so a<br>video analytics system is essentially a<br>system that analyzes videos so it's<br>really all in the name but the idea is<br>that we want to try and get some<br>high-level and information about what's<br>happening in that video so let's take a<br>supermarket for example we might be able<br>to use camera footage that's taken from<br>inside that supermarket and find out<br>where the people are so we can detect<br>the people we can count the number of<br>people inside the supermarket that can<br>help inform some insights into how<br>people are using that supermarket so<br>which path they're taking what how many<br>people there are at certain times of the<br>day that can feed into higher level<br>business decisions around which items do<br>we need to put closer to the aisle<br>entrances and exits how many staff do we<br>need at certain times and we can get<br>some better insights into consumer<br>behavior so you can start to answer<br>questions like which items are people<br>picking up but not necessarily buying so<br>that we can send out a special offer<br>next month and so you might call video<br>analytics a form of video surveillance<br>but this mode of any scenario shows that<br>we're moving beyond sort of law<br>enforcement and public safety type<br>applications so as the costs of computer<br>vision start to go down and accuracy of<br>these systems keeps improving we're<br>going to see more commercial entities<br>like supermarkets try to use this type<br>of technology to give them some more<br>business intelligence and so the primary<br>enabling technology behind all of this<br>is artificial intelligence and machine<br>learning so there have been a lot of<br>convolutional neural networks that have<br>been developed over the last decade or<br>so that have really accelerated the<br>development in this area and they've<br>achieved really high levels of accuracy<br>the catch is that most of these<br>algorithms while very accurate are very<br>very slow so there's a recent algorithm<br>that is designed for personal detection<br>and it operates at about 90 percent<br>accuracy and unconstrained environments<br>so it's used in airports and train<br>stations and it can get 90% accuracy but<br>it takes one or six minutes to process<br>one second of footage<br>so you get this massive backlog of<br>footage that's not being processed and<br>so we need to find some solution to that<br>in addition to that we have embedded<br>systems that are being used in the real<br>world so these are computers that are<br>resource constrained they're not as<br>powerful as the computers that these<br>algorithms are being developed on and so<br>we don't have thousand-dollar GPUs to<br>use we have very small computers that we<br>need to do this processing on and so as<br>is common in engineering we have to find<br>a balance between speed and accuracy we<br>need enough speed to be able to do this<br>in real time but also if the systems are<br>inaccurate then there's sort of no point<br>another important thing to remember is<br>that in the real world we don't often<br>have labeled training data so what that<br>means is that for a lot of these<br>algorithms that are currently being<br>developed you need hundreds of thousands<br>of examples of the types of images that<br>you're trying to process so if you're<br>trying to do facial recognition and you<br>might need yeah millions of examples of<br>people's faces to know how to what sort<br>of facial features to look for but if<br>you're in a supermarket and you've got a<br>customer who's coming for the first time<br>where are you going to get that training<br>data so we need to use what we call<br>unsupervised learning algorithms instead<br>and so the bulk of the work of my PhD is<br>the development of this multi target<br>multi camera tracking system so this<br>system was developed at a test<br>environment over at Newmarket campus<br>where we've got a couple of cameras that<br>are overlapping and watching the same<br>space and so we've used this<br>plug-and-play modular pipeline which<br>allows us to choose a couple of<br>different algorithms and use them at<br>different points in the system to try<br>and balance between speed and accuracy<br>and while we use the couple of<br>off-the-shelf algorithms it turns out<br>that not all of the algorithms out there<br>are any good and so we had to develop a<br>couple ourselves I mean I'm using the<br>rule we here so actually I had to<br>develop a couple myself and and so we've<br>got three novel algorithms at the<br>background estimation feature matching<br>and position tracking stages designed to<br>try and balance speed and accuracy and<br>the system uses unsupervised learning<br>and so we don't need a bunch of training<br>data these algorithms are all selected<br>to meet that criteria and in particular<br>the system is going to keep improving<br>over time so as it operator's going to<br>learning about how to process that<br>footage and get better and we've done<br>experiments that show that you can run<br>this on embedded hardware in real time<br>so here's a video so here you can see<br>the system operating and on the top<br>right you can see a map so these dots<br>are being drawn as I move around this<br>space this top wall here is the this<br>wall on these two cameras and you can<br>see that as I'm walking around at<br>drawing the dots in real time and the<br>system's running at about 20 to 30<br>frames per second so that's pretty fast<br>on a standard PC and even though it's<br>not 100% accurate you can see that it's<br>picking me up enough of the time that<br>does path that's being drawn here is<br>pretty representative of the path that<br>I'm taking as I moved throughout the<br>room but while developing the technical<br>system is the vast majority of my PhD I<br>sort of felt feel bad about it right<br>because as probably most of you are<br>thinking it seems a little bit more well<br>in scenes a little bit Big Brother and<br>and and it seems to me that a lot of<br>Engineers sort of just build the cool<br>thing and then worry about the<br>consequences later so I wanted to really<br>understand the ethics behind my work and<br>and to place my work within that context<br>and so I've done a budget of work into<br>privacy and we wanted to understand what<br>makes people feel more or less<br>comfortable about the use of<br>surveillance cameras so we ran a massive<br>survey well reasonably sized survey<br>depending on which field you're from<br>from our field this is pretty big and<br>it's a mixed method online survey where<br>we asked a bunch of scenario-based<br>questions so what we did was that we<br>told people stories right we said here's<br>a story an example of how cameras are<br>being used and all of them were sort of<br>practically practical and potentially<br>real scenarios and then asked<br>participants to put themselves in that<br>context and what we found was sort of<br>five major factors that pushed people<br>one way or another so exes who has<br>access to that video footage there's a<br>one government official or is it a<br>thousand corporate employees is there a<br>person and the loop or is all of this<br>footage going to be processed<br>automatically and can the person who's<br>being observed actually be identified or<br>more importantly will there be<br>personally targeted actions as a result<br>of being observed does the purpose of<br>having that severe<br>surveillance camera system benefit the<br>person that's being observed and last of<br>all do we trust the owner of the network<br>do we believe that they're competent and<br>so a lot of people said that they didn't<br>believe that the government or<br>corporations could be trusted to hold on<br>to their data securely so what do we do<br>with that well there are two pathways to<br>actually implement some of the route<br>relevant protections so we can do this<br>by regulation governments must pass laws<br>that protect our privacy and force them<br>by punishing those that and fringe upon<br>the privacy rights of individuals sounds<br>great<br>it's probably what we expect the problem<br>being that governments are really really<br>slow and they tend to be well behind<br>where the technology is so other option<br>is to do it by design so techno<br>technology developers like myself should<br>or must build privacy into their systems<br>so that it is impossible to infringe<br>upon people's privacy by default so<br>here's one design here's one that I<br>designed earlier so this is the privacy<br>of firming architecture and what we're<br>doing here is that we're doing some of<br>the processing at the point of image<br>capture so we have smart cameras that<br>are able to do some of their processing<br>and we're separating that from the<br>central coordinate or the central server<br>and what happens here is that we can do<br>some preliminary processing and then<br>delete the footage so the end effect is<br>that the human user who are using it<br>from the central coordinator never sees<br>that footage and while this doesn't<br>solve all of the privacy problems it<br>does go some way towards protecting<br>privacy by default because what that<br>means is that if you've got a malicious<br>system owner who is a little bit pervy<br>and as sort of voyeuristically looking<br>at the customers as they move through<br>the supermarket if they have the system<br>they can't because the footage doesn't<br>exist and one thing that you'll notice<br>is that it supports that modular<br>pipeline that I described earlier so<br>these two elements actually really go<br>hand-in-hand and the other thing that<br>you'll notice is that this is a<br>technical solution so this is a solution<br>that no lawmaker could come up with<br>sitting in Parliament by themselves this<br>is something that you have to do with<br>technologists in conjunction with policy<br>makers so to sort of conclude I've been<br>talking about my thesis in the system<br>that I've created and it's two things<br>it's practical in this<br>that they can run on and better systems<br>in real time and it's ethical in the<br>sense that it actually does care a<br>little bit about privacy and does<br>something to try and protect people's<br>privacy in that sense and those are the<br>two factors that we really need to take<br>into account when we're trying to<br>translate a lot of this academic<br>research into the real world<br>no mihi new eco Katara I'd like to thank<br>a my colleagues in the meadow systems<br>research group my supervisors malteaser<br>and kevin my good friend back to the<br>robot who plays a good game of chess and<br>all of you here for listening tonight</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
