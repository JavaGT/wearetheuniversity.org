and the<br>case goes cold this is the reality for<br>many cases in New Zealand and worldwide<br>and this is something that my research<br>hopes to change<br>good evening I'm Rebecca I'm a forensic<br>science PhD student at the University of<br>Auckland but based at ESR which is the<br>crown Research Institute New Zealand<br>that provides forensic services to<br>police and my research looks at how we<br>can use DNA methylation or CPG markers<br>in forensic applications namely to help<br>identify the donor of a DNA sample so<br>just to begin what is DNA methylation so<br>DNA is made up of four bases adenine<br>thymine cytosine and guanine and DNA<br>methylation is simply the addition of a<br>methyl group to these bases and most<br>almost exclusively occurs at the<br>cytosine base in humans to form<br>5-methylcytosine<br>and it most commonly occurs in the<br>context of a CPG site so that's when a<br>cytosine is followed by a guanine it's<br>an epigenetic modification which like<br>you've heard influences gene expression<br>it's also stable and it's preserved<br>during cellular division which makes it<br>a good biomarker but what's really cool<br>about DNA methylation is that it's<br>influenced by a wide variety of<br>environmental and lifestyle factors this<br>includes exercise medication diet<br>tobacco and alcohol consumption as well<br>as stress levels and age so why is this<br>of interest in forensics well currently<br>if a crime occurs and biological<br>evidence is left at a scene we can test<br>this to get the DNA profile and then we<br>can compare that crime scene DNA profile<br>to DNA profiles of knowing people if a<br>match occurs we can link that person to<br>our crime scene evidence however a<br>problem arises when that crime scene DNA<br>profile<br>chili links to two different people and<br>this is what happens in the case of<br>identical twins because identical twins<br>have come from the same fertilized egg<br>they have the same DNA profile which<br>means that we cannot tell which twin<br>deposited a DNA sample and there<br>obviously poses problems for<br>investigators and in court<br>however because DNA methylation is no<br>one to be influenced by those wide range<br>of factors although they might have the<br>same DNA profile identical twins should<br>show differences and their DNA<br>methylation patterns and using this we<br>could differentiate them the other issue<br>that occurs in forensic biology is when<br>our crime-scene sample doesn't match to<br>any known person now in these cases we<br>usually can't give investigators much<br>more information however one of the<br>things that DNA methylation is known to<br>be influenced by is age so if we could<br>find DNA methylation correlated markers<br>that occur level of age we could be able<br>to perform a prediction model and<br>actually is to make the age of a person<br>from their DNA and provide this<br>intelligence information to<br>investigators so these are the two<br>applications that I'm interested in<br>making research literature has shown<br>that it is possible and we wanted to<br>establish could we do this in the new<br>zealand population and could we do it<br>using a methodology that could be easily<br>implemented and to our forensic lab so<br>the objectives of my research are first<br>to identify CPG or methylation markers<br>that are either correlated with age or<br>could be used to a different chair<br>identical twins develop these into<br>marker panels and use them in<br>principally relevant body fluids tests<br>and New Zealand population and then we<br>also want to explore the variables that<br>could impact the accuracy and finally<br>validate this methodology for casework<br>so I began by collecting samples from<br>other individuals of a wide range of<br>Ages or my identical twins I extracted<br>the DNA for my identical twins we<br>underwent standard DNA profiling to in<br>fact establish that they were identical<br>and then I and<br>a process for DNA methylation profiling<br>which involves a lot of fancy<br>instruments but ultimately it involves<br>these three steps and what's important<br>is that these three steps in combination<br>has been used in clinical epigenetics<br>but at the time of this research they<br>weren't really used in forensic research<br>however this is the process we wanted to<br>use because it was the best integrated<br>into our forensic lab the output of that<br>is sequencing data which I then had to<br>burn phonetically process to determine<br>the level of methylation for each of my<br>markers and then I did some statistical<br>analysis so age estimation that was<br>determined that was using correlation<br>and regression analysis and for<br>identical twin differentiation that was<br>using our Pietists t-test sorry in<br>p-values so my proof-of-concept study<br>had five pairs of identical twins in 28<br>individuals of a range of Ages my<br>individuals were roughly evenly<br>distributed across many different age<br>groups<br>I collected buckle which are cheeks our<br>samples blood finger for examples and<br>semen where possible from my participant<br>and then I developed for different<br>multiplexers some multiplexers are a way<br>that we can look at a whole bunch of<br>markers from the same DNA sample and<br>that's really important in forensic<br>analysis because we often don't have a<br>lot of DNA to work with so two of these<br>were focused on age correlated markers<br>in blood one was focused on age<br>correlated markers and semen and one was<br>focused on my twin differentiation<br>markers so now for some results I ended<br>up looking at 84 different CPG markers<br>for my 28 individuals from my blood<br>samples and some of these as you can see<br>showed quite a decent correlation with<br>age I then used a process called<br>stepwise regression to identify the best<br>combinations of markers to put in my<br>prediction model and I ended up<br>developing this linear regression model<br>which had three markers and that had an<br>adjusted r-squared of 0.87 so a squared<br>is hard way we can measure how well the<br>model is working with one being<br>completely perfect and higher being<br>better this model also had a<br>average deviation of 3.26 two years and<br>what that means is that on average my<br>predicted age was just over three years<br>away from my observed age of my<br>participants this research was very<br>comparable to what had previously been<br>reported in the literature from other<br>studies that used other methodology so<br>that was promising for our methodology I<br>did the same thing with my semen samples<br>however in this case I only had samples<br>from eight individuals I looked at 10<br>sites again some of them showed a really<br>nice correlation with age I ended up<br>developing a linear regression model<br>that had one site in it and that had a<br>mean average deviation of just over four<br>years and again that was pretty<br>comparable with what had been reported<br>in the literature so finally I also<br>wanted to see if I could differentiate<br>my identical twins for this I used<br>buccal samples I looked at 31 different<br>sites and what I found was that there<br>was at least one site in all of my twin<br>pairs that showed significantly<br>different levels of methylation at the 5<br>percent significance level however there<br>was no sight that was consistently<br>different across all of my twin pairs<br>now if I just draw your attention to<br>this graph what was really interesting<br>was if you can look at the second site<br>then you see that the level of<br>methylation was quite different between<br>20 and 20 whereas in the last night it<br>was actually really really small despite<br>still being statistically significant so<br>this broad have a lot of questions for<br>us regarding if we were going to take<br>this board into casework do we need to<br>start thinking about some thresholds for<br>the minimum number of differences or<br>magnitude of those differences so in<br>conclusion I would love to say yes we<br>can use these methylation markers to<br>help with identification but in reality<br>we're still at the early stages so I'm<br>going to limit it by just saying it<br>shows promise at this stage and the New<br>Zealand population there's still a lot<br>of work to be done so some of the things<br>that I'm looking at is developing my<br>methodology and my statistical models in<br>particular particularly maybe looking at<br>some machine learning algorithms I<br>obviously want to tell<br>and a much much larger sample size with<br>a wider age range including children I'm<br>also really interested in investigating<br>how those methylation patterns might<br>change over time and this is going to be<br>really important say if a crime scene<br>sample is left in January you find your<br>person of interest in July they turn out<br>to be an identical twin how much<br>variation are we expecting to see<br>between those samples of that twin is<br>the true donor and finally I want to<br>perform a whole bunch of validation<br>studies so we could actually use this in<br>court<br>not only in New Zealand but also<br>worldwide just got a few acknowledgments<br>for my funding and my support my<br>supervisors and also my volunteers thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
