koto tena<br>koutou tena koutou katoa<br>Akira everyone both those here in those<br>with us on livestream elsewhere my name<br>is Richard Blakey I'm the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for research and Enterprise<br>at the University of Otago and it's my<br>great pleasure and privilege to welcome<br>you here tonight to the inaugural<br>professorial lecture or miss Michelle<br>Thompson for Fawcett<br>I just want to pause though also in the<br>mud they hire a highway pokey a deer are<br>a Keith de Paul to those that have<br>passed be at peace and I'd like to take<br>this moment to acknowledge the passing<br>of one of our own University of Otago<br>kumara professor Keith hunter former pro<br>vice-chancellor from the division of des<br>Sciences who passed this week just<br>thinking of you Keith your waiver is<br>strong you will live on and long with us<br>all highly mine with that<br>welcome colleagues visitors members of<br>Dunedin community to the special<br>occasion for us as a university to a<br>special occasion for the department of<br>geography the division of humanities<br>take boat I'm a Maori and prefer and<br>especially professor Michelle Thompson<br>Fawcett who we celebrate here tonight<br>with IPL a special welcome to your<br>family Michelle Marc Daisy and Jade<br>husband and kids are here to all of your<br>family who are listening online I hope<br>that I hope the link is working in that<br>this will get recorded and played back<br>many times because it is a very very<br>special occasion it's special for us too<br>at the University because it's a<br>celebration of all that it means to<br>become a professor here at the<br>University of Otago Kafala wanna know<br>how Co from our founding for professors<br>Scott Sharon black and sail we have set<br>very high standards for us<br>and for that position whether someone<br>that's appointed from afar as they were<br>or grown from within it is attributes<br>such as sustained excellence and<br>leadership in two of our core activities<br>of teaching research and service and<br>aamir sustained excellence and a third<br>that our requirements one cannot<br>compromise excellence in any of these<br>three pillars of our profits oriole<br>practice in order to attain this highest<br>of status so and when these standards<br>are met as it's well worth putting on<br>the Ritz getting out our gowns calling<br>on our calling our leaders together and<br>celebrating which is why we are here<br>tonight and why we will retire for<br>refreshments and fellowship at the staff<br>club at the end of proceedings it's also<br>a selfish exercise for us as academic<br>leaders to forget about everything else<br>that's going on in the universe you<br>forget about exam marking or other<br>bureaucratic things that might be<br>bothering us for the day and hear about<br>the wonderful work and achievement of<br>some of the finest minds it's what I<br>like to call academic spare time for<br>some of us now my job here is to um<br>probably get out of the way as quickly<br>as possible but it is on behalf of the<br>vice-chancellor who has oversees the<br>formalities for me are to set the scene<br>and then hand over to Professor Jacinta<br>Zulu the founding chair of tape o-tama<br>male Maori to introduce professor<br>Thompson faucet and then at the end of<br>the proceedings I don't do anything but<br>I allow professor Tony Ballentine the<br>pro vice-chancellor division of<br>humanities to give a vote of thanks and<br>to lead us to the staff club so as I've<br>indicated already we set very high<br>standards for determining whether or not<br>to appoint or promote a professor to<br>this university and in this process we<br>seek the views of many others I have had<br>the privilege to be able to see some of<br>the things that we have had written<br>about Michelle's status and<br>contributions both from those explicitly<br>writing as supporters of this and other<br>nominations I've had the privilege to be<br>aware of and those being asked to give<br>an impartial evidence-based view and<br>rather than pulling any particular<br>individuals quotes out of many of<br>the voluminous nomination statements and<br>and nominations that have been put<br>together I can draw upon some<br>summarizing views that have come through<br>these and some some highlights and<br>bullet points Michelle Thompson Forsyth<br>Nattie Farah is one of the most<br>significant environmental geographers of<br>our time full-stop explanation mark<br>having successfully forged a globally<br>relevant research program intent on<br>decolonizing the disciplines of<br>geography and planning also the inquiry<br>she poses go to the heart of identity<br>belonging and social justice and<br>placemaking in place managing she<br>increasingly draws on tale Madonna and<br>Martha Langer Mallory to challenge the<br>possibilities for sustainable urban<br>planning she is at the forefront<br>internationally for valuing indigenous<br>knowledge and critiquing theories of<br>power and space the researchers admired<br>for its originality depth of analysis<br>and Trust transformative potential for<br>society her expertise has been widely<br>recognized and is extensively sought<br>after leading to many national and<br>overseas collaborations so with those<br>remarks even though I was not formally<br>connected with your promotion miss it<br>Michelle these confirmed me the wisdom<br>of the vice-chancellor endorsing your<br>promotion so please accept my heartfelt<br>congratulations on this deserved honor<br>and enough CID from me Cathy aki-nee we<br>are upon it as my pleasure to ask<br>professor Ruru now to formally introduce<br>you in the topic of your lecture tonight<br>thank you very much<br>Anoka talk yatta tato so does my great<br>pleasure to introduce my dear colleague<br>professor Michelle Thompson Fossett born<br>an Auckland of natty far to a deceit<br>Michelle is one of the most significant<br>environmental geographers of our time<br>she has successfully forged the globally<br>relevant research and teaching program<br>intent on decolonizing the disciplines<br>of geography and planning posing<br>inquiries that go to the heart of<br>identity belonging and social justice<br>and knowing and managing place deeply<br>influenced by what she saw around her<br>growing up and the expanding urban<br>sprawl of the city she has built a<br>career and making sense of all tear<br>dollar new zealand a colonized place<br>michelle graduated with a Bachelor of<br>town planning in 1985 and gained<br>experience as a planner at the New<br>Plymouth City Council Taranaki Regional<br>Council in Monaco City Council in the<br>1990s she embarked on a postgraduate<br>study completing first two masters of<br>planning at the University of Auckland<br>and then her PhD at the University of<br>Oxford an April 1999 here and her<br>husband Mark moved to Dunedin becoming a<br>lecturer and geography at the University<br>of Otago michelle has published an<br>enormous amount of work the tally reads<br>something like this more than 160<br>research outputs including co-edited<br>books book chapters journal articles in<br>conference presentations in addition she<br>has written more than 30 reports for<br>planning and policy practitioners<br>including Maori communities one of my<br>favourite pieces of her research as a<br>co-authored seminal book entitled only<br>to boot order indigenous knowledge in<br>sustainable urban design that draws on<br>to our madama a method on Ahmadi to<br>challenge the possibilities for<br>sustainable urban planning who<br>research and teaching our admired for<br>originality depth of analysis in<br>transformative potential for society<br>accolades for just this year include<br>being named the distinguished New<br>Zealand geographer the occult hero a<br>national award for sustainable<br>sustainable excellence and tertiary<br>teaching Anika Papa Marty category and<br>the John Morrison award for merit for<br>outstanding contribution to theory and<br>practice of planning she's also won a<br>significant national award for her<br>postgraduate supervision and recognition<br>of her extraordinary role as supervisor<br>to more than 80 thesis students<br>including 14 international and 14 martí<br>thesis students michelle is a generous<br>contributor here at Otago she's been<br>associate dean Marty for Humanities and<br>as the current head of department of<br>geography she's been instrumental in the<br>success of tipota mamadi Otago smartie<br>academic star caucus and more recently<br>the new University of Otago poutama<br>utter doe research theme that is<br>promoting and facilitating new research<br>and Marty lecturing and teaching so I<br>will always remember first meeting<br>Michelle I was a nervous new academic<br>with eyebrows raised and welcome she was<br>notable as the only other Marty academic<br>and the teen storied Richardson building<br>effect by the way that remains true<br>today she embraced me and instilled in<br>me the confidence and integrity to both<br>dream or an implementer research and<br>teaching programs and practices that<br>made sense to us as Marty<br>she's been a constant mentor for nearly<br>two decades I know she has similarly<br>touched the lives of many of the<br>students and staff at Otago she is one<br>of the most committed and innovative<br>teachers and researchers I know that is<br>a great honor to welcome professor<br>Michelle Thompson Fossett out here at<br>our New Zealand's first professor of<br>geography no my Hut oh my Michelle<br>we are aruna

coming out this evening to be<br>here these proceedings at the outset and<br>I'd like to acknowledge the role of my<br>colleagues my collaborators and students<br>in particular for actually leading me to<br>this point i I didn't go unlit and I'd<br>like to express my particular very<br>special appreciation for the Marty staff<br>from across the university who ever<br>embraced and nurtured me from my<br>earliest days here initially via the<br>Maruyama of the tertiary Union and also<br>by a female Fiat - in the last 10 or 11<br>years through - PO Tam Amari and on our<br>many other ventures as well but most of<br>all I'd like to salute the steadfast<br>person<br>parents with me of mark Daisy did my<br>parents and fun Oh<br>why you may ask are we here and I'm not<br>speaking philosophically I mean<br>literally why are we here<br>IPL czar never presented here so why<br>well is because identity in place<br>matters this is the lecture theatre that<br>I've done most of my lecturing in over<br>the last 20 years it's a place I<br>identify with although I wouldn't go so<br>far as to say I feel at home here but my<br>litter tonight is all about identity in<br>that's best in point in the circle this<br>is Auckland forty years ago to the Year<br>a large fleet of army lorries and Jeeps<br>many many many of them rolled through<br>central Tamaki Makaurau Auckland to<br>reinforce 700 police officers in<br>spelling protesters on ancestral Maori<br>lands in the heart of enna suburbia less<br>than eight kilometres from downtown in<br>1976 the crown had announced its<br>intention to allow development on the<br>remaining land at Tucker potiphar best<br>end point for prestigious waterfront<br>housing this was the last 25 hectares of<br>Crown land at autarky and the hope hapu<br>had hoped it would be returned by way of<br>protest against this high-end<br>development proposal the Araki Maori<br>Action Committee occupied temporary<br>housing for five hundred and six days on<br>that land that is<br>until this 222 of the protesters were<br>arrested for trespassing on these<br>ancestral lands of natty Fatah and<br>temporary meeting house buildings and<br>gardens were demolished the politics of<br>the situation were complicated however<br>the occupation confronted New Zealanders<br>more powerfully than ever before with a<br>legacy of colonial domination in the<br>urban context the completely fraught<br>enduring haunting history of the land<br>around the sport RK or kaho bay area<br>tells a damning story about how the city<br>of Auckland was created and has<br>continued to be reproduced over time I<br>was a school kid living less than two<br>kilometres away from all of this<br>activity as it took place<br>I was cognizant of the tormenting<br>history of Tonga Dafina WA been<br>deliberately displaced from the Taronga<br>why why and identity at all RK as part<br>of a century long colonial praxis of<br>disposition and displacement as I saw<br>all of this unfold it seemed to me that<br>the ongoing politics of place and power<br>and justice is linked to the control of<br>space we're among the most important<br>issues you could seek to unveil in our<br>society so this provided a deeply<br>challenging agenda for my undergraduate<br>studies uncovering the importance of<br>place in the maintenance of cultural<br>identity revealing the power relations<br>evident in the practices surrounding<br>space but then envisioning hopefully<br>transformation that would facilitate the<br>aspirations of decolonization in this<br>area thus the subjects of geography and<br>planning seemed like too obvious<br>starting points for my life at<br>university amongst other things<br>the discipline of geography is a primary<br>pathway to revealing and explaining such<br>complexities of power particularly in<br>regard to place and identity<br>and social justice the discipline of<br>planning on the other hand has the<br>mandate to evaluate options for<br>transformation in place and space<br>seeking practical ways Ford in terms of<br>advancing social and physical<br>sustainability so my talk tonight is<br>so now let me explain my talks title in<br>case you didn't get it and my aims in<br>the presentation so the title the<br>concept of Funaki tongue act we -<br>is the notion of developing and<br>improving our activities and lives in a<br>way that is sustainable for the long<br>term so it's kind of like sustainable<br>development if you like and I'm<br>especially focusing tonight on the<br>cultural sustainability in an urban<br>context as for the subtitle a Tale of<br>Two Cities I'm not in this instance<br>thinking about to physically separate<br>cities although I do happen to have<br>examples from two locations today in<br>Tamaki Makaurau Auckland and Otto<br>tae-hee Christchurch but in this<br>instance the way that I'm thinking of -<br>is in the term meaning to remain or<br>settings in place so the difference that<br>I'm interested in highlighting today are<br>not so much a cross space but across<br>time that is the changes occurring in<br>long-established cities that are dynamic<br>over time and remain and need of further<br>transformation in order to achieve<br>development that is actually culturally<br>sustainable and I intend to convey two<br>principle messages today regarding<br>priorities as I see them and over the<br>two listed in the bottom part of the<br>slide the first is about enabling Marty<br>students to be motto donor maori leaders<br>on campus<br>sorry learners on campus both ashlynn<br>that is offering a teaching and learning<br>environment specifically for Marty<br>students not merely teaching students<br>who happen to be Maori and then my<br>second point is about the need for<br>envisioning TR Maori and Martorano marry<br>within the city itself these two<br>elements are deeply intertwined and my<br>activities at the University so by way<br>of contextualizing the first message<br>about enabling Maori students I want to<br>list a few examples of many that I could<br>draw on copious numbers that I could<br>draw on from my own experience these<br>echo the stories I receive from our<br>Maori alumni on a regular basis there<br>are stories of being the isolated person<br>of Maori descent in the workforce<br>whether by choice or at the urging of<br>others as the sole martí presence we are<br>the go-to person for all things Maori<br>for example as an undergraduate student<br>I was told it would be really good if<br>you could organize a trip to the local<br>mirai for your class even though you're<br>not a tutor or a demonstrator in that<br>course as a regional government employee<br>I was told you would be the appropriate<br>person to work on identifying the social<br>impact assessment issues with local II<br>we even though you've never worked on<br>impact assessment before as a city<br>council employee I was told the local<br>Erie environmental agency is wanting<br>someone to facilitate their development<br>of an Erie management plan we think<br>you're that person even though we've not<br>had any experience at facilitating<br>anything and then on the second day at<br>work here I was told we have a brand new<br>Maori PhD student working on a topic<br>that's well outside your area of<br>expertise<br>we consider you would be the best person<br>to be the primary supervisor now being<br>channeled willingly or by surprise and<br>tamari related avenues has been part of<br>the course for me as it is for our Maori<br>alumni and on one level that's fine<br>many such activities are at the heart of<br>what I might consider my calling yet on<br>another level it's also complicated and<br>that these are often situations in which<br>I'm not set up to succeed precisely<br>because I am a lone voice or the<br>situations in which I elect the motto<br>wrong are to be culturally secure or<br>their additional tasks they add to my<br>overflowing cup of such opportunities as<br>a university I think it's important to<br>recognize this reality for our Maori<br>students Maori students and alumni are<br>caught on by Irian hapu by employers or<br>at their own instigation to facilitate<br>Mauri related development to be Maori in<br>their learning and working lives there<br>is a weight of expectation on them from<br>the work place and from Maori<br>communities that is different to what<br>our other students experienced and we as<br>a university can and should expedite<br>their confidence and success in being<br>Maori graduates of our institution not<br>just graduates of our institution and we<br>can do that by contextualizing our<br>teaching to the place in which we live<br>embracing disciplinary related matter on<br>our expertise we should be encouraging<br>these students to be Mari here ensuring<br>they maintain their integrity as Maori<br>students as Maori academic thinkers all<br>the while located in this park a higher<br>institution the more Martorano competent<br>students we have graduating the less<br>likely the isolated employee and making<br>inroads in this necessitates more<br>martyring a competent academics within<br>every discipline and institutions like<br>ours a proportional to our increasing<br>Maori student and intake<br>so to help me work towards this because<br>they don't necessarily achieve it but I<br>work towards us in terms of my teaching<br>and learning related to Marty<br>geographies and planning a framework for<br>my teaching activities as depicted in<br>this artwork by Daisy my daughter here<br>Thank You Daisy<br>it starts in the middle with a hoof<br>anyway which some of you will know is<br>the name that we were gifted as a<br>departments for our department which is<br>symbolic of the union between people<br>environment and identity significantly<br>fennel is both the word for the unborn<br>child's placenta and also the word for<br>the land both the united by the delivery<br>of the babies fear now back to the earth<br>after the birth of the child this is a<br>practice that permanently connects the<br>child with the land or place in which<br>they belong your identity is in place<br>the place of your ancestors that<br>connection between people and the land<br>as a disciplinary space in which I work<br>a dove type a dovetailing of environment<br>in people the fern fronds in this<br>artwork denote kaitiaki tongue out or<br>guardianship and Manawa or given<br>confidence to students in their<br>endeavors these pole our module aims of<br>fostering understanding of our natural<br>and physical environment and inspiring<br>people to develop the confidence and<br>passion to act as stewards for us the<br>overarching element depicted above the<br>front pocket it e means navigating or<br>finding a way forward that is working<br>with students to uphold the precious<br>connection between people and place<br>enhancing the environment that we live<br>for our mokopuna it involves encouraging<br>the appreciation of Marti ways of<br>knowing and what that means for managing<br>our natural and physical environment<br>then on to my second message my second<br>message relates to envisioning to our<br>Marty and muttering Amaury in the city<br>or reclaiming indigenous identity in<br>place<br>this is one of the main strands but not<br>the only strand of my research activity<br>and by way of introducing my research<br>let me start by recounting how I<br>established the focus for my PhD in the<br>1990s I was working in Planet Planning<br>practice and Tamaki Makaurau Auckland on<br>urban growth management in the East<br>Tamaki corridor we as local authorities<br>city planners were presented by<br>developers and consultants with<br>well-formed conceptual plans to<br>establish urban villages in this quickly<br>growing urban periphery location the<br>urban village is a British a British<br>form of compact nodal urban development<br>characterized by medium density housing<br>mixed land uses and activities and the<br>use of traditional local vernacular<br>architecture urban villages have had an<br>exponential increase in popularity<br>around the world in the last thirty<br>years however their adoption into<br>planning policy and then construction on<br>the ground was undertaken swiftly and<br>prolifically in a really uncritical<br>manner my question was are such urban<br>villagers are such urban village notions<br>a contextually appropriate development<br>option in South Auckland where did these<br>ideas originate who developed them what<br>was the intent behind them planning is<br>never purely technical and it's never<br>neutral so what would such an approach<br>to growth management in South Auckland<br>mean for local aspirations and equity<br>and in our treaty context was this just<br>another fashionable colonial practice<br>uplifted from Britain of which of which<br>we should be very wary so I left<br>planning practice in the midst of there<br>and undertook a PhD in the UK examining<br>up close and really personal all the<br>founders of this idea and their<br>foundations and the implications of this<br>urban village model it seemed<br>fundamental to invest investigate the<br>social relations that were<br>implicated in this redesign of the urban<br>landscape of South Auckland the<br>conservative authoritarian controlling<br>ideology that I uncovered warned of the<br>ease with which arterial New Zealand was<br>again slipping into the further<br>embedding of colonial models and<br>contemporary urban activities our<br>planning and policy practitioners in<br>this country need to be aware of their<br>ingrained entanglements when they<br>endorse a model like that of the urban<br>village the urban village concept is<br>integrally connected to complex<br>ideological processes and social and<br>moral enterprises but in our country a<br>critical part of urban planning is<br>running processes that give expression<br>to our unique cultural context and<br>heritage and ensuring that our built<br>environment reflects among other things<br>the values and aspirations of Maori<br>communities or at least it should be so<br>I was now acutely aware firsthand of the<br>need to increase the capacity of our<br>Tiras municipal and environmental<br>decision-makers and officials in terms<br>of TR mari and mathura Amaury<br>if decolonization of our planning<br>thinking in this country was to be<br>achieved meaningfully so subsequently as<br>both Mark and I were completing our<br>doctorates overseas we decided that we<br>would seek jobs back in New Zealand and<br>in particular seek jobs and autopathy<br>Dunedin which we had identified and thus<br>targeted<br>on our checklist it made the top of the<br>list I had some all taneous job offers<br>from the Otago Regional Council and the<br>University of Otago but which would be<br>the best vehicle for achieving<br>transformation and planning practice in<br>this country<br>well we both made the decision to head<br>to the University of Otago having<br>actually applied upon seeing two side by<br>side job vacancies in the Otago Bulletin<br>and then we were later phoned to be told<br>of our success within 10 minutes of each<br>other and so we've both been here for<br>nearly 20 years we're incredibly stable<br>but highly dynamic as well so in reality<br>it was the potential of teaching a<br>decolonizing effort ethic that placed me<br>in the University in response to my<br>decade and planning practice and the<br>findings of my doctorate this job choice<br>was a deliberate quest to work with<br>those who are about to embark on<br>becoming our nation's and other nations<br>environmental planning advisers and<br>decision-makers that is Maori for whom<br>the potential of decolonization could be<br>unlocked nan Marty who could be<br>challenged to understand the practical<br>implications of partnership under the<br>treaty and non-maori and international<br>students who could be attuned to what it<br>means to more than merely hear the cause<br>of indigenous peoples around the world<br>so in the last 20 years my teaching and<br>research have been intricately<br>interlaced this means I find it really<br>hard to undertake any research that<br>doesn't overtly connect the goal of<br>transforming of transforming<br>professional practice so perhaps my<br>activities as are just as much teaching<br>lead research as opposed to research<br>lead teaching ok so what I want to do<br>now is give you a taste of the broader<br>picture of the research that I've been<br>undertaking since arriving and all Tea<br>Party Dunedin the research I fused<br>together here today<br>has all been part of collaborative and<br>mostly transdisciplinary or perhaps we<br>can think of it as holistically oriented<br>efforts with other academics across<br>multiple departments particularly Maori<br>academics across multiple departments<br>and Maori communities and also a lot of<br>time with my two graduate students that<br>I work with many of whom are here<br>together we work with tango defend our<br>groups and seeking to achieve their<br>aspirations for urban and papakainga<br>development cultural landscape<br>stewardship indigenous impact assessment<br>and the guardianship of the natural and<br>physical environment let me start by<br>outlining the failure of planning<br>planning systems around the world have<br>both directly and indirectly<br>marginalized and oppressed indigenous<br>peoples so it has been near impossible<br>for indigenous groups to achieve their<br>aspirations the degree of indigenous<br>involvement and planning has been widely<br>discussed internationally in the last<br>two decade it's due to their ongoing<br>under representation of indigenous<br>groups in any planning processes a key<br>focus has been the failure of the<br>conventional planning processes to<br>acknowledge respect and understand<br>indigenous knowledge 'as values and<br>interests appropriately in addition<br>ongoing colonial practices have<br>restricted the rights of indigenous<br>groups to plan protect and partake in<br>planning colonization has pushed aside<br>indigenous ethics and languages to such<br>a degree that it's actually very<br>difficult for indigenous groups to even<br>imagine how best to reaffirm their<br>traditional principles and practices in<br>a way that will be influential in<br>achieving outcomes yet indigenous groups<br>responsibilities for their local<br>environment remain whoever happens to<br>own the land or whatever the legal<br>framework<br>so up substantial extent any attempts to<br>achieve indigenous participation have<br>been based on the notion that indigenous<br>groups will contribute via the<br>conventional options the Western<br>bureaucratic system has in place thus<br>often rendering the permitted<br>involvement quite tokenistic<br>participation that requires conforming<br>to bureaucratic practices and timetables<br>demanding a form of communication that<br>may be unfamiliar and culturally<br>dismissive necessarily erect a barrier<br>to genuine respectful engagement<br>similarly for the last century and a<br>half and Itoi New Zealand Maori<br>communities have had to live with a<br>Western system of environmental<br>management and planning as a part of the<br>colonial enterprise and that has set<br>aside it ignored traditional roles and<br>practices that mário communities have<br>long undertaken in the environment this<br>more than disappointing global and local<br>situation and provides me with an ample<br>motivation to address the fact that<br>democratic legal and planning systems<br>have struggled to cater for meaningful<br>planning in with and by indigenous<br>groups<br>yeah and attempting to rectify this<br>travesty there is a good deal of<br>creative energy actually required to<br>translate indigenous knowledge into 21st<br>century development and planning for<br>example it is clear that the directions<br>being taken by Irian hapu in relation to<br>such activity are derived from<br>long-standing traditional values that<br>are being reengaged for the contemporary<br>context and the research I've been<br>involved in we have had an explicit<br>intention of communicating the creative<br>potential of indigenous culture<br>encountering the influence of<br>colonization and ubiquitous global<br>practices in so doing we aim to deliver<br>an appreciation of indigenous<br>understandings that can be incorporated<br>into a re-energized willingness for<br>meaningful relationships between Maori<br>resource users and a<br>making agencies critical to this<br>endeavor is the recognition that Maori<br>conceptualizations of the environment<br>are vastly different to Western ones the<br>integrated understanding that Maori<br>communities have of landscapes ancestors<br>events histories and practices deeply<br>challenges conventional contemporary<br>colonial processes in arterial New<br>Zealand in particular as is typical of<br>many colonial societies the presence of<br>indigenous groups has long been rendered<br>invisible and Arturo's urban fabric<br>moving through the built environment of<br>our cities you would generally have no<br>hint of an indigenous present manifest<br>in the city this is indicative of the<br>marginalization of indigenous voices<br>names histories landmarks practices and<br>symbolism in the business-as-usual<br>practices of City Planning nevertheless<br>recent years have seen some examples of<br>meaningful effort in planning thinking<br>and practice to understand indigenous<br>values as well as some innovative<br>undertakings by indigenous communities<br>in working towards their own urban<br>aspirations yes Marty community's<br>involvement in planning has long been<br>hindered by a legacy of ignorant towards<br>their Taha wider spiritual well-being<br>and Matauranga and counter colonial<br>interests that they have however such<br>ignorance has been incremental IDI<br>stabilized recently through things like<br>political decentralization the<br>introduction of a more minority<br>conscious electoral system under MMP and<br>resource management and local government<br>reforms there have that have advocated a<br>more community inclusive approach to<br>planning and increased accountability in<br>terms of implementation of the<br>principles of the Treaty of Waitangi so<br>specifically what is being done to<br>reinsert indigenous aspirations and our<br>supposedly post-colonial urban<br>environments how do we achieve the<br>co-creation of urban environments so<br>that they all<br>so do reflect indigenous identities we<br>need to reimagine the urban landscape as<br>rich with indigenous identity values and<br>principles these values are intricately<br>linked to philosophies from long-held<br>and intimate relationships between<br>people in place there - aware pop<br>our connection Maori world views are<br>holistic and cyclic all humans are<br>interconnected to all living things and<br>to the spiritual realm interwoven by<br>Foucault Papa like a kind of 3d<br>multifaceted multi-layered genealogy the<br>profound relationship that Maori have<br>with the surrounding environment<br>provides the basis of Maori practices<br>and is underpinned by Marty creation<br>narratives that anger nui and papa -<br>enugu narratives explain the creation of<br>the physical world and all things within<br>it these narratives emphasize the<br>connection between Maori communities and<br>the natural and spiritual environment by<br>describing the world as a vast and<br>interlinking family tree from which<br>Marty descend as a result this<br>relationship has influenced social<br>conduct for many generations and guided<br>her tongue at Affinia interact with the<br>environment papatuanuku nourishes all<br>humankind and all other living things<br>and concomitantly<br>the duty of care for the environment<br>belongs to the maori community it is an<br>obligation to act as kaitiaki or<br>guardians and respect and care for<br>ancestors and their environment for the<br>generations to come Maori communities<br>possess both an embedded responsibility<br>towards and a unique knowledge base<br>about the natural physical and spiritual<br>spiritual environment and currently<br>Maori lid urban design and planning<br>practice for example is playing a really<br>significant role in reconnecting the<br>indigenous past with ever-evolving<br>contemporary urbanization in doing so<br>these accomplishments are articulating<br>as somewhat lost right to the city that<br>is now reshaping urban experience for<br>all residents not just Maori resident<br>for Maori communities the built<br>environment is not simply about physical<br>spaces rather it is an expression and<br>extension of identity physical surrounds<br>are inseparable from ancestors events<br>practices and context so Maori<br>development activity is holistic and<br>conception let's have a look briefly at<br>what that can look like Tamaki Makaurau<br>Auckland a really inspirational model of<br>contemporary transformation addressing<br>such issues is now emerging on that site<br>of historic controversy at Tucker<br>purifier best end point just 8<br>kilometers from downtown and the center<br>of Auckland Isthmus a medium density<br>development by an artifact or rock' has<br>been designed as a traditionally it's<br>traditionally inspired environmentally<br>and socially sustainable project that<br>aims to attract and to accommodate hapu<br>members back onto these ancestral lands<br>the master plan development this<br>community has undertaken is located on<br>land that the harpy bought back from the<br>crown in 1996 it is an inner-city suburb<br>surrounded by some of the most upmarket<br>waterfront housing in the city the hapu<br>was creating a comprehensive development<br>based on customary values and principles<br>that will enhance the political the<br>social cultural spiritual environmental<br>and economic conditions of the nati<br>fertile community this has now been<br>facilitated by a special purpose<br>activity zone within the Auckland<br>District plan a plan change initiated by<br>an artefact were themselves that<br>facilitates tribal reestablishment on<br>ancestral land and according to really<br>importantly according to preferred<br>tribal lifestyle it recognizes that an<br>artifact to us should be able to use its<br>ancestral land in a manner that provides<br>for tribal needs and aspirations in<br>order to arrive at the development plan<br>for the site Marta first of a trust<br>board ran more than 30<br>meetings plus educate obsessions and<br>workshops way more than the City<br>Council's ever run when they're trying<br>to work out their plans these establish<br>the planning process the conceptual<br>ideas the preferred living environments<br>and the customary principles that would<br>guide development including the<br>following principles the principle of<br>quarter heating or collaboration and<br>cohesion prioritizing things like<br>community facilities and amenities<br>making sure that they included health<br>clinics for example making sure they<br>included educational environments and<br>providing natural cultural and leisure<br>amenities in the area a second principle<br>was that of why drew a tongue or soul<br>insurance development orientation faces<br>towards important landmarks and<br>ancestors for example a third principle<br>was manake tongue or Hospitality<br>guaranteeing access to traditional food<br>sources to enable generous hospitality<br>and there's been a lot done on site to<br>enable the growth of natural food<br>sources again for knowing a tongue a<br>membership creating places that reflect<br>identity providing heritage markers<br>providing community oriented housing and<br>gardens where people can live in<br>community with each other first<br>principle kaitiaki tongue or<br>guardianship and stewardship this has<br>included things like achieving<br>restoration of waterways and natural<br>areas using passive design creating<br>on-site mitigation of gray water and<br>storm water ensuring careful use of<br>rainwater and solar energy clustering<br>buildings to maximize communal reserves<br>and restoration of natural features and<br>then a sixth principle of rangatiratanga<br>about self-determination and<br>independence promoting self-sufficiency<br>within the development of the site and<br>with their creating employment prospects<br>and home occupation opportunities on<br>site the resulting development which<br>under construction but not yet completed<br>also includes apartments low-rise<br>townhouses detached elders housing<br>shared courtyards orchards shared<br>vegetable gardens community buildings<br>and some play space among other<br>amenities potentially 6,500 member<br>families will live on the site and new<br>financial arrangements have been put in<br>place to ensure tribe members can<br>actually afford to live in this really<br>posh part of Auckland members who buy<br>houses will lease them for 150 years<br>whether tribe based corporate system<br>being set up to run the development and<br>place of the conventional body corporate<br>system New Zealand operates this is all<br>part of a goal to reinvigorate the<br>location as the heart of the happy<br>so--such attainments are a far cry from<br>the displacing land confiscations<br>evictions protests and demolitions that<br>litter the urban history of this very<br>landscape Attica potiphar contemporary<br>activities on this site represents an<br>indigenous community centered resurgence<br>defending homelands against colonialism<br>with integrity achieving that within the<br>urban setting is no mean feat especially<br>in Auckland my second location is auto<br>tahi Christchurch this is a really<br>exciting project as well and<br>internationally groundbreaking in terms<br>of what they're undertaking it's the<br>progress that's taking place in the city<br>in particular that I'm interested in in<br>response to post earthquake earthquake<br>reconstruction of the central area there<br>have been several mechanisms for change<br>that have been used as part of the<br>process of reinventing the city and<br>counter to the likelihood of the urgency<br>of planning after a major disaster<br>meaning that participating practices are<br>diminished in certain regards the<br>replanting of auto taaha Christchurch<br>has actually led to enhanced<br>participatory options for<br>my Tahu my Tahu as the local a we were<br>quick to respond to the earthquake and<br>earthquakes in terms of establishing<br>immediate relief efforts and also in<br>terms of brokering relationships between<br>key services and stakeholders to get the<br>city running again<br>in addition further to existing<br>statutory requirements for engagement<br>with Maori and planning processes and<br>the expanded obligations for roles and<br>decision-making post nighter whose<br>treaty settlement in 1998 the Tonga<br>Tofino have been formally represented at<br>most levels of the temporary earthquake<br>recovery governance systems that have<br>been set up in the city this has<br>involved multiple types of engagement<br>including with the main trouble by body<br>the night ah-hoo earthquakes recovery<br>group the tribes health agency the local<br>local manaphy NOAA urban design agency<br>the main local sub tribal communities<br>the environmental consultancy of the six<br>local sub tribal groups and the joint<br>management board partnership between<br>nighta who the recovery agency and the<br>city council the various nighta who<br>body's have recognized the<br>reconstruction period as an opportunity<br>to bring about change inclusivity and a<br>real sense of belonging up until this<br>time many Maori and Christchurch saw no<br>reflection of their culture in this city<br>the city which is located within the<br>territory in material terms the result<br>has been reconstruction that better<br>interweaves traditional language for<br>example better enter where's traditional<br>includes reconfiguring natural heritage<br>that's for dinner and reintroduces local<br>narratives and important Maori values<br>and aspirations as well this is a really<br>significant shift particularly for the<br>city as massive while planning<br>administration became centralized<br>through the recovery process the<br>government and the tribe both used the<br>recovery as an opportunity to connect<br>local government and mitre who as<br>partners this is a move that has<br>enhanced indigenous influence as<br>compared to conventional practices in<br>the city up until the 2010-11<br>earthquakes what is clear in the<br>redevelopment of the city is that the<br>growing engagement both vertical in<br>terms of up and down different tiers of<br>government and horizontal by an array of<br>different agencies is very successfully<br>weaving into the urban fabric key tribal<br>values such as identity hospitality<br>autonomy and spiritual calling as well<br>as historical and contemporary<br>connections with land waterways and<br>treasures in the city we are witnessing<br>in autotelic Christchurch as rebuild<br>development been woven into this been<br>woven into the city that is more<br>meaningful and respectful of mota who<br>lived experiences narratives and<br>practices nevertheless the construction<br>of the study in the city is still highly<br>contested in terms of whose narratives<br>are told or retold and whose unknowns<br>and the assorted tensions in the process<br>reinforced the critical importance of<br>indigenous groups being around the<br>decision-making table across all layers<br>of governance so what we have in these<br>two<br>very different city examples in Auckland<br>and Christchurch our first an<br>illustration of a tongue of defend our<br>community creating a traditionally<br>founded living environment for the hapu<br>in Auckland and secondly a multifaceted<br>professor Tait approach to giving voice<br>and visibility to Maori presence across<br>the city of Christchurch we see an<br>innovative interweaving of traditional<br>and contemporary urban design we see a<br>reclaiming of Maori spatial narratives<br>in the city we can observe the<br>re-establishing of the cultural presence<br>of Maori in the city in these two<br>distinct ways in these two different<br>locations now will non-indigenous<br>certain citizens actually notice the<br>difference they may recognize a<br>difference in the process that has been<br>used for governance and decision-making<br>possibly not they may notice a<br>difference in the principles and values<br>that are driving some development in the<br>city they may appreciate the difference<br>in the symbolism around the city some<br>overt art and sculpture as visible to<br>all<br>however the narratives behind them may<br>be subtle enough to remain non only to<br>some does it matter<br>not all processes and outcomes need to<br>be understood by everybody but as an<br>indigenous group being able to recognize<br>your identity in the city is critical<br>that is being able to be yourself and<br>see yourself in the city that you in<br>heaven crucially though such indigenous<br>transformation also has implications for<br>dominant society which itself needs to<br>be informed and even reformed by the<br>challenges emerging from the indigenous<br>world so back to the idea of two<br>T's T u cities cities across time the<br>colonial city that was and the reclaimed<br>city that is becoming the examples I've<br>highlighted demonstrates the tremendous<br>potential for interlacing traditional<br>and present-day practices of<br>urbanization re-establishing the<br>cultural and prayer imperative and<br>presence of indigenous groups in cities<br>and concomitantly improving the<br>prospects for more socially and<br>culturally sustainable urban<br>environments transforming the city<br>reinventing the city reclaiming the city<br>of many histories not just certain<br>groups histories we see that the<br>contemporary approach by Maori<br>communities to planning and development<br>is not unrehearsed rather development<br>has been considered against a long<br>legacy of constitutional struggles and<br>sustained adherence to traditional<br>values and practices the notion that<br>Maori are partners and decision making<br>about the natural and physical<br>environment is key to understanding Irie<br>and hapu approaches that have been<br>developed the fact that Maori were<br>dispossessed of ownership of practically<br>all land has not obviated their sense of<br>responsibility for decisions that affect<br>land and water and their localities in<br>the cities within their way in this<br>Maori are at a point that is similar to<br>many other indigenous peoples around the<br>world<br>internationally decades of effort have<br>gone into securing mere recognition and<br>then in some cases attempting to shift<br>beyond that to self-determination<br>through collective self affirmation<br>recent strategies adopted by a number<br>indigenous activists First Nations<br>groups in Canada are moving past a focus<br>on their position in relation to the<br>colonial state and instead towards<br>fashioning their own decolonizing<br>practices of freedom that is not being<br>trapped in<br>endless seeking of recognition and<br>empowerment from the state rather being<br>liver liberated by their own<br>transformative practice praxis the<br>challenge is to be a provocative and<br>constructive contributor to the<br>potential implementer implementation of<br>an interrupted reinvest urbanity an<br>ability that can embrace diversity<br>courtesy of genuine plurality in its<br>realization so at the core of my<br>research is the belief and<br>decolonization making sense of<br>indigenous understandings furthering<br>indigenous aspirations while also<br>seeking to change priorities held in the<br>seats of power<br>I have transformative hopes I have hope<br>that decision makers will grow and their<br>willingness to learn and cherish other<br>ways of knowing they will seek to<br>understand other ways of knowing I have<br>hoped that decision makers will be<br>involved in the capacity-building of<br>dominant society not the<br>capacity-building of indigenous groups a<br>capacity-building of dominant society to<br>support and understand indigenous<br>aspirations for cities landscapes and<br>environments I've hoped that decision<br>makers will be involved in redressing<br>current power imbalances and developing<br>mechanisms that are meaningful for<br>genuine partnership and I have hoped<br>that we will embrace indigenous cultural<br>and environmental knowledge 'as in order<br>to shift from a parable to shift from a<br>privilege of the majority to a<br>coexistence of self-determining peoples<br>and of course to help achieve these<br>hopes over the long haul as an<br>institution here at OU Tago we need to<br>grow graduates who are competent and<br>maori sciences and understandings so<br>they can lead us in that change we need<br>to have a diversity of academic staff<br>who are able to teach beyond Western<br>science<br>two other ways of knowing staff who can<br>inspire genuine and meaningful Maori<br>contributions to society and from our<br>Marty graduates not solely educate<br>students some of whom might happen to be<br>Maori in Western paradigms an effect of<br>located nurse is critical to learning<br>and working outcomes in the arterial New<br>Zealand context that involves learning<br>and research initiatives that reassert<br>the potency and the integrity of<br>indigenous philosophies and actions that<br>involves considering how we might honor<br>variation indigeneity through our<br>teaching and investigative practices in<br>our university we need to foster<br>learning environments where indigenous<br>knowledge culture and values are<br>recognized as normal and absolutely<br>legitimate we're being indigenous being<br>Maori is normal it's about creating<br>space within all our university<br>disciplines all of them for a<br>distinctive and dizziness learning and<br>intellectualism the trajectory of our<br>ambitions a Tartar go is really positive<br>the implementation needs to catch up a<br>bit though to move us towards<br>Funaki tong a tweety now just a<br>publicity stunt here if<br>if taken by surprise back there<br>if these sorts of issues interest you<br>you may like to attend our departments<br>public lecture on Wednesday night as<br>well which is presented by the wonderful<br>professor lovey Porter sitting right<br>there in the middle<br>who's visiting us from RMIT in Melbourne<br>can you 1818 okoto Tina Coto<br>Tina Tata Tata<br>you know coach Licata I'm Tony balance<br>the PBC humanities and there's with<br>great I think we all agree that she has<br>given a truly excellent lecture<br>providing rich insights and to the<br>commitments to frame her research<br>ensuring some important reflections on<br>the power of geography and planning to<br>shape our society and its possible<br>futures the relationships between space<br>place and social difference have stood<br>at the heart of Michelle's talk<br>she has reminded us that we live within<br>places in spaces that were remade by<br>colonization and that those processes<br>have created fundamentally and even<br>cultural frameworks for our lives here<br>until Waipounamu into eco Maui she<br>observed that planning is never purely<br>technical and that it is not neutral at<br>his great power to influence how space<br>is organized and how social<br>relationships work on the ground a<br>lecture has also made a strong argument<br>about the ways in which bureaucratic<br>practices and the common assumptions of<br>participatory democracy frame Maori<br>communities is stakeholders and how<br>these have worked just so annoyed Kapoor<br>and II we and contain and married<br>managed multi difference in the power of<br>rangatiratanga this evening Michelle has<br>made a really positive case for planning<br>as an agent of transformation it can be<br>something that empowers if we move<br>beyond business as usual and recognize<br>the weight and significance of mato Dino<br>Maori and mana finish stages this would<br>be a decolonized winning a set of<br>practices that could help reshape our<br>places and our politics a way of more<br>fully realizing our located 'no cents of<br>the lecture was michelle using daisies<br>evil in our image<br>to imagine this Culpeper to render<br>x-values visible to all of us I also<br>really liked to highlight the challenge<br>that Michels thrown down to us<br>she has reminded us all of the<br>centrality of students to the University<br>she has talked about something that we<br>haven't heard much about before which is<br>teaching lead research and she's<br>reminded us of the vital role that we<br>have in the university as professionals<br>and challenging established ideas and<br>enabling student achievement and in<br>supporting the success of mardik<br>students as Marty to my mind one of the<br>most powerful dimensions of this lecture<br>has been sitting out very strong<br>connections between teaching research<br>and professional practice as we try and<br>unpack the legacies of the colonial past<br>Michelle is a brilliant teacher and<br>inspirational supervisor and we're very<br>lucky to have her help us through those<br>conversations in the coming years so<br>Michelle you have done a great job and<br>it is terrific that we can all be here<br>together with you to celebrate your<br>promotion and your fantastic<br>contribution to your department our<br>division and to the University as a<br>teacher in researcher I had something<br>I've prepared a little earlier I didn't<br>really I have a I have a gift to give to<br>Michelle so could you please join and<br>congratulating her thanking here and I'd<br>like you all to follow to a little<br>function and the staff thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
