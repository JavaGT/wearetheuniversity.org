Perhaps those living in residential areas had been comforted by the fact that the Department of Conservation and its predecessors have been doing their best to save our native birds from extinction on offshore islands, or more recently, mainland eco-sanctuaries. But, these endeavours on their own, are not enough to reverse the ongoing decline in native biodiversity.<br><br>Professor Bruce Clarkson is Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research at the University of Waikato. He is a restoration ecologist interested in habitat restoration to bring indigenous nature back into towns and cities. Prof Clarkson leads a Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment funded research programme: People, Cities and Nature: restoring indigenous nature in urban environments (https://www.peoplecitiesnature.co.nz/). In 2016 he received the Royal Society of New Zealand Charles Fleming medal for environmental achievement for his efforts to advance and communicate understanding of native plant ecology and vegetation pattern and process, inform conservation efforts in terrestrial, freshwater and urban environments, and support effective on-the-ground restoration practice. He is a board member of the Australasian chapter of the International Society for Ecological Restoration, on the Governance Group for the Building Better Homes, Towns and Cities National Science Challenge, and is ambassador for the New Zealand's Biological Heritage National Science Challenge.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>here's the progress that's been made to<br>date so 2004 when we started the only<br>native plants there were a couple of<br>scruffy hoorah kooky on the people<br>lakeshore and a couple of Monica whole<br>band of Willow which has subsequently<br>been removed and by 2016 the figure it<br>was up to 31 hectares of new habitat<br>being created and now in 2018 it's well<br>over 35 hectares so how did we do all of<br>this we did this by working with the<br>council but we largely did it by<br>voluntary community activity and the<br>photograph here shows what happens on<br>Ann Arbor Day at wife Ricki so<br>June 2016 Arbor Day planting 1800 people<br>twenty-eight thousand plants 3 hectares<br>in 3 hours that's how we've been putting<br>it together now of course it does take a<br>bit longer than that because notice all<br>of the plants lying on the ground there<br>who laid all of those out over the<br>previous two days to make sure they were<br>in the right place so that they would be<br>planted appropriately so there is a lot<br>of prep goes into it it's a military<br>operation but every Arbor Day this is<br>what we do and of course over the period<br>from 2004 to 2008 een there's been an<br>enormous amount of learning about the<br>appropriate way to plant native plants<br>so in the first year when the council<br>staff wander back to check the plantings<br>I think over 20 percent of them still<br>2018 when the chick was done it was less<br>than 1% needed to be replanted so<br>there's been a huge community learning<br>and of course there's been that social<br>cohesion built as a person who planted<br>the plant in 2014 and might have been at<br>secondary school then is now a parent<br>who's taking their children along and<br>teaching their children how to do this<br>properly this is the importance of urban<br>ecology so I'm afraid that I'm now going<br>to get into the hard part of my talk<br>because I do need to point out that up<br>until now I've been giving you a whole<br>lot of ideas and I guess you might say<br>visionary statements the question still<br>is what is it based on well it's<br>actually based on a whole lot of<br>research I'm not just making it up key<br>and I'm not and I just wanted to quickly<br>flick through some of the examples of<br>the research that we've done to underpin<br>this process so the list here is the<br>sort of research I'm not going to read<br>through it all that myself and my urban<br>ecology team have been doing for about<br>the last 15 years to help make sure we<br>do the stuff right so I'm just going to<br>briefly comment on each slide and I<br>don't expect you to take in all of the<br>detail what we've found of course is<br>that in restoration planting in our city<br>there is a tendency to use a very small<br>subset of the flora that we should be<br>using if we are serious about habitat<br>reconstruction so the figures for<br>Hamilton ecological district 343<br>vascular species in our ecological<br>district within our city only a hundred<br>and ninety-five species are present that<br>shows you the shortfall and within that<br>a hundred and ninety five species people<br>mostly use up to 11 to 15 species of a<br>system that should have in it three<br>hundred and forty-three species we also<br>know that the<br>the species and thus this sort of<br>illustrates it further is that we have<br>interesting gaps in what is being used<br>you know the focus is always on the<br>things that form the canopy what about<br>all of the things that should be in the<br>understory what about all of the things<br>that should eventually be in the ground<br>cover and this research simply<br>demonstrates that we are doing more<br>poorly with understory species than we<br>are with canopy species in order to have<br>a persistent ecosystem we need to build<br>the diversity to get the resilience this<br>graph simply gives me the comfort of<br>knowing that actually when we do the<br>planting these are three here at three<br>different age classes of planting yes<br>the answer is native species richness<br>increases I would have been in real<br>trouble if we hadn't have got that<br>answer also when you're working in a<br>place like Wi-Fi curriki you can<br>demonstrate to the people who are<br>funding you that you are removing the<br>weeds so here is what happens when you<br>get canopy closure in the forest and all<br>of those pasture grasses and pasture<br>weeds disappear the the downward trading<br>curve is the way those species are lost<br>between the years of 2008 in 2016<br>because we have a network a permanent<br>network of monitoring plots to track our<br>success in the habitat reconstruction<br>the graph on the right shrimp Lee<br>simply shows that the longer you are<br>there the more the native plant<br>regeneration increases and how does it<br>increase because your plants mature they<br>start to flower they suck to fruit they<br>drop their seed their proper eul's and<br>progressively you get native plants<br>regenerating on the site that you did<br>not plant but the big challenge that<br>remains is to do with things that most<br>people never<br>notice on there never see this diagram<br>is just a flesh way of saying that when<br>you do your pb3 planting what you don't<br>know about is what's in the seed bank in<br>Watson the seed rain so that what you're<br>trying to do when you're doing habitat<br>reconstruction is not only put plants in<br>the ground you're trying to get the<br>ecosystem to move in a direction where<br>increasingly the seed bank and the seed<br>rain is dominated by native species and<br>not by exotic particularly weedy problem<br>plants this research shows that in the<br>same way that predation is a problem for<br>our native birds regeneration is<br>compromised by those same predators that<br>eat they munch they destroy the seed<br>that is being produced from the plants<br>that you plant so pest control has the<br>double benefit of protecting the native<br>birds but also assisting the process of<br>regeneration when we did this research<br>we caged seeds and left other other<br>seeds uncaged to see what the survival<br>rate was and this graph simply shows<br>that when you cage them you actually<br>they will stay there because they are<br>not destroyed by the predator but when<br>they do not have that protection the<br>rats and the mice and the opossums and<br>all the rest chew at them and<br>essentially destroy them thereby present<br>a preventing regeneration now of course<br>I'm looking at this data now and<br>thinking predator-free New Zealand 2050<br>perhaps your experiment was before its<br>time if we could get the result of<br>predator pre 2050 what will it do for<br>the regeneration of our native flora<br>environmental drivers we've done a whole<br>lot of hardcore work there to try and<br>understand what is the threshold point<br>at which you start to gain control of<br>your site now this<br>complex-looking mathematical model<br>merely shows you there's a circle up<br>there on the left at 20 years and what<br>it says is once you have canopy closure<br>you control the fluctuation in<br>temperatures in the soil and within the<br>patch of habitat you suddenly get a<br>burst of regeneration so 20 years in you<br>will it could take you 20 years of work<br>before you really start seeing the<br>results I guess the message and this is<br>if you're going to create habitat you<br>need to be in it for the<br>intergenerational game it's not just<br>about what you do as a volunteer today<br>but what is going to come after you<br>who's going to be the succession plan<br>for the young people who join your group<br>and continue the project on into the<br>next 20 30 40 50 s this model was a way<br>of testing what is the appropriate time<br>and what is the survival rate for what<br>we call enrichment planting that's when<br>you go back into your site 12 or 15<br>years later and you pop some additional<br>species and because your pioneer species<br>are declining and in fact dying and the<br>message from this one was yes by the<br>time you get to age 12 or 15 that is the<br>time to add the things to the understory<br>and the caveat on that is please make<br>sure you do not plant mono dominant<br>stands of species like Monica because<br>they will slow the process of<br>regeneration of other species down and<br>then the perennial question that may<br>volunteer groups have asked us what do I<br>do about the treta scanty yet<br>do I need to completely remove it what<br>should I do to overcome that invasive<br>all-encompassing Matt and trader scan<br>tear in the habitat well this one this<br>graph is merely there to show a simple<br>result if you plant your understory<br>species at a height of at least one<br>meter they will survive they will grow<br>and they will progressively make life<br>more difficult for the trellis can tear<br>but if you go in there with short plants<br>less than a meter high and plant them<br>into a try to scan tiamat they will be<br>overwhelmed they will be covered up and<br>overwhelmed and the further north you go<br>in New Zealand the higher the plant is<br>that you have to plant if you go to<br>Northland the threshold there is about<br>1.5 meters because Trader scandia is<br>even more vigorous in Northland than it<br>is in Hamilton where I live of course<br>there are new things on the horizon now<br>that are helping in this process have<br>you guys got the beetle yet if you've<br>got the beetle in Toronto yeah you've<br>got the three species of beetle that<br>start to defoliate the traders can tear<br>that can give you that little edge which<br>will allow some of the native species to<br>regenerate in the last experiment that I<br>wanted to show was again we were trying<br>to think of ways to beat the predator<br>and this data simply showed that if you<br>put a clay ball around a seed like tawa<br>or some of the others then you would get<br>a twenty five percent survival rate just<br>because you put it in a clay ball again<br>I'm thinking this experiment is now out<br>of date because it was predator free<br>2050 on horizon<br>last experiment just before we get to<br>the the softer part of the talk of your<br>life we've also been experimenting with<br>reintroducing some of the really<br>specialist plants and the habitats and<br>these are the the shrub epiphytes that<br>grow up in the big trees New Zealand is<br>remarkable because it has a guild<br>collection of small shrubs which are<br>adapted to more or less entirely growing<br>perching way up in the canopy of other<br>plants and there some just some pictures<br>there on the left of toffee Recaro the<br>pittosporum corner folium and the one on<br>the right rizzoli near lucid ER these<br>had been almost entirely lost from the<br>small patches in Hamilton City because<br>the possums had eaten them all out once<br>we got control of the possums we can<br>then think about bringing them back into<br>the system and that's what we've done so<br>we've run a trial and demonstrated that<br>over a six-year period we can get 85%<br>survival of shrub epiphytes that we<br>bought back into the habitat now of<br>course it's not just about constructing<br>reconstructing the habitat it is also<br>about pest control and this is the scale<br>of the pest control that's been going on<br>in Hamilton city so for a start there's<br>a lot of pest control going on within<br>the reserves within the city but as well<br>in a 15 kilometer radius around the city<br>there's been intensive pest control in<br>those large chunks of forest MACT and<br>Reed they're on the diagram you can see<br>the grid there in the middle Hamilton<br>city and you can see the red bits out<br>around either near to or just beyond the<br>15 kilometer radius there's been<br>intensive Pest Control going on there<br>but pulsed pest control like every four<br>to six years and as a result in Hamilton<br>City when I moved there in 1992 and from<br>the period 1992 up until the period 2009<br>approximately in my gully might be even<br>my gully we saw one to a over a period<br>of 30 minutes<br>the combination of habitat<br>reconstruction and pest control has led<br>in Hamilton City to what we call the TUI<br>tipping point we got to the point where<br>TUI's went from<br>reported sightings in 2007 of 11:28 in<br>2008 and by 2009 490 sightings and<br>already starting to nest in the year<br>2007 and by this time 2009 had come the<br>Facebook site that the Regional Council<br>had set up for people to record their to<br>e sightings had to be decommissioned<br>because people were sick and tired of<br>reporting to ease so the bigger picture<br>in Hamilton and it applies here in<br>Tehran and to of courses that as well as<br>working within the city we've been<br>thinking about ways to link the city to<br>the period Evans own natural corridors<br>are provided by our Hamilton gullies<br>because they have tributaries that<br>extend way beyond the boundary of the<br>city and come into the city so natural<br>corridors are being produced from the<br>habitat risk reconstruction caused by<br>riparian planting but as well as those<br>this is what's happening over our way at<br>the moment so all of those new<br>expressways all of the new motorways<br>that are being built we are looking at<br>those as an opportunity to further<br>connect and Link habitats from one place<br>to another and that's essentially what<br>those images are trying to show at every<br>opportunity look for opportunities for<br>reconnection of indigenous habitats now<br>we know that when we get to this point<br>when we can actually turn around and our<br>city once we've built the predator proof<br>fence at Wi-Fi curriki and got these<br>birds back we're probably in the state<br>that we need to be we're still at least<br>15 to 20 years away from that<br>we're building the habitat first at<br>Wi-Fi curriki when we've got 55 or the<br>60 hectares planted up then we'll<br>consider putting the fence around and<br>then we'll be starting to think about<br>can we bring the birds back above and<br>beyond the ubiquitous tui and the<br>occasional visiting<br>bell bird and the single pair of keroro<br>that we currently have in one reserved<br>now I'm not saying that what's happened<br>in Hamilton City is exactly able to be<br>translated across other urban<br>environments in New Zealand but I think<br>it gives plenty of clues about what can<br>be done to help places that have<br>depleted their biodiversity - less than<br>10% in Hamilton our solution has been to<br>work on the gullies if we worked on all<br>of those that we restored or<br>reconstructed in all of them we'd get<br>eight point six percent of habitat back<br>and if we just kept working away at our<br>little patches if we put all of us<br>together we would quite easily just go<br>past New Plymouth's eight point nine<br>percent and of course that's the way<br>we're framing it with the community<br>we're encouraging the community our<br>target is to beat New Plymouth right<br>unfortunately people in New Plymouth<br>know that now<br>and they are now working at their next<br>target which is closer to 15% through<br>some of the projects going on down there<br>at the moment you may have heard of<br>project manga and all of the money<br>that's just been dropped into New<br>Plymouth's to get rid of predators so um<br>I guess what I'm saying though is that<br>we need to systematically think about<br>the current scenario here in Tauranga<br>and see what could be done here in<br>tirana the constraints that we'll have<br>to overcome are many this is a list of<br>them but I'm not going to go through<br>every single one of them because<br>actually I've really covered those off<br>already<br>there are numerous constraints but I<br>tend to focus on the opportunities<br>because I'm an optimist<br>and here are some of the key<br>opportunities presented by restoration<br>in urban environments probably above all<br>the potential for intensive human<br>intervention the very thing that was the<br>Achilles heel of removing the flora and<br>fauna can be turned into the major<br>benefit the lack of grazing animals in<br>urban environments there's a massive<br>advantage when you're trying to<br>reconstruct the forest and of course<br>some of those predators are nowhere near<br>as common in the urban environment as<br>they are in the peri-urban zone or the<br>rural zone and it's also the place where<br>all of the resources are concentrated so<br>you know coordinated interagency action<br>and the convergence of disciplines and<br>capability can all be brought to bear on<br>restoring an urban environment but when<br>you do it you'll get more than just the<br>biodiversity although you may be<br>focusing on the flora and fauna you get<br>all of the other benefits of doing this<br>sort of work<br>you know this habitat when it's<br>reconstructed is filtering our air and<br>our water it's providing a cooling<br>buffering on you know heat islands<br>within urban and<br>it's providing opportunities for other<br>activity recreation is the one that<br>comes to mind above everything else you<br>know all of those walkways and cycleways<br>that go through places that also have<br>enormous ly important values for our<br>flora and fauna and you know in the face<br>retrieve plant will sequester carbon and<br>help us meet the Paris target and we got<br>a fair way to go even if we got the<br>billion trees will we make that target<br>but also the health and Recreation<br>benefits first of all of getting out<br>there in them you know getting out and<br>doing something out in the in the park<br>or the garden where you're working you<br>know the cycleways the walkways all of<br>these things have enormous health and<br>recreation benefits which are actually<br>preventative medicine as opposed to<br>waiting till you get crook because<br>you're not doing enough physical<br>activity above all though I think the<br>importance of urban ecology is around<br>reconnecting children with nature<br>because there's one thing that's<br>happened in society in New Zealand is<br>that over the last couple of generations<br>or so you know we all had that direct<br>connection to the rural zone you know<br>all the kids were seed off to the uncles<br>and auntie's on the farm for their<br>holiday but you know now 80 percent of<br>us have little or no connection to that<br>environment and that means we have a<br>generation of young people coming<br>through who's only understanding of<br>nature is what they see on a screen<br>right as opposed to getting out there<br>and learning about it in the real world<br>a well informed public is actually one<br>of the most important applications of<br>urban ecology so when I started this<br>talk I'm sure you realized I wasn't<br>going to say even restoration no it's<br>not the new frontier I was never going<br>to say that was I I sincerely believe<br>that it is the new frontier it's taking<br>us beyond that stage of mainland island<br>restoration and we're moving into a new<br>environment a new opportunity presented<br>by urban restoration and what we've been<br>doing at the University of Waikato is<br>trying to build this into our research<br>programs and the results that I've<br>reported to you here tonight come from<br>our Ministry of business innovation and<br>employment funded<br>search program people cities and nature<br>I don't have time to tell you all about<br>the content of the work going on in<br>there but I've been focusing on one<br>element of it and one element alone I've<br>been essentially focusing on the habitat<br>reconstruction using plants there's way<br>more to it than that I want to close off<br>by just throwing a few thoughts your way<br>in relation to Turin and of course I<br>don't live here and I don't claim to to<br>know everything about it in fact I<br>probably know very little about it but I<br>do know I can when I see potential I can<br>see it and if Taronga has enormous<br>potential in the space so there's that<br>curve type again and just that reminder<br>if you really want flora and fauna to<br>persist in your urban environment you're<br>gonna have to do something about the<br>hollowing out of that curve you're gonna<br>have to look at it somewhere and the<br>question is where will you lift it well<br>we've been doing some work already in<br>some of your parks and reserves this is<br>just a little map those yellow dots as<br>with where some of our monitoring plots<br>are located and man do we see potential<br>in tirana I mean when you think about<br>what's actually happening in tirana<br>already mo al what a Jim you know just<br>imagine if that could be developed to<br>its full extent<br>what about corporal reira reveille man<br>is that the place to focus your activity<br>you have a corridor going from one end<br>of the city all the way through and<br>linking up to the estuary it's a massive<br>ecological corridor in waiting and just<br>by focusing on some of those existing<br>bits and bringing them back to full<br>health you could be heading towards the<br>ten percent target I could go on I mean<br>I keep seeing good examples and Johnson<br>Reserve I've had a bit of experience<br>with them recently Johnson Reserve<br>there's another Jim it comes from the<br>headwater of the streams that run<br>through there and again it comes right<br>to the coast and links to the estuary<br>again the potential poor habitat<br>reconstruction and looking after our<br>flora and fauna is enormous there so I<br>guess what I'm doing to conclude as I'm<br>posing the question to you and the<br>audience are we doing enough<br>imagine Taronga city in 2050<br>you have many of the key ingredients to<br>achieve the 10% target over large chunks<br>of your city and I sincerely believed<br>that cities in fact will be the place<br>that will determine the fate of<br>remaining biodiversity of our regions of<br>our nation and the planet so we're<br>better to start because there will be no<br>sustainable world without sustainable<br>cities thank you very much<br>thank you very much if you'd like to<br>remain there I open the floor to<br>questions ladies and gentlemen thank you<br>sir for a very interesting and<br>informative and indeed inspiring talk<br>however several times you seem to equate<br>exotic species with nuisance species and<br>I feel that's a very harsh well a harsh<br>generalization anyway I'm a bit of a fan<br>of Northern European deciduous trees and<br>why can't we integrate them why does it<br>all have to be the pristine New Zealand<br>native forests can we have some exotics<br>they aren't useless please good question<br>but you said at one point in your is<br>your question to me why can't we have<br>both and of course the answer as we can<br>but boy we can rebalance the situation<br>because currently we have 97% of your<br>habitat in Turanga city dominated by<br>things other than native the call that<br>I'm making tonight is about rebalancing<br>our system you know this is a for<br>another form of decolonization of New<br>Zealand because what has happened here<br>is that Europeans have come in bought<br>their flora and fauna with them and<br>ignored the treasure sitting in front of<br>their eyes the treasure of the 80%<br>endemic plants and even higher levels of<br>India measurement among some of their<br>animals in favor of something they<br>bought with them it is a value judgment<br>absolutely but let me continue I am also<br>not against exotic species that do not<br>cause a problem or are not a nuisance<br>for our native habitat but what about<br>the flowering cherry what about you know<br>let me go on what I'm saying is let's<br>rebalance the environment let's get it<br>back to and treasure the things that are<br>unique<br>biological heritage get the balance<br>right and also let's hammer species<br>which are exotic and are invasive yes<br>when I'm doing habitat reconstructions I<br>sometimes use exotic species and<br>transition them to indigenous dominance<br>but they are a tool for my use they are<br>not to stay on the landscape I think the<br>time is long gone in art or art era New<br>Zealand where we should be giving<br>priority to exotic species over the<br>things that are our indigenous<br>biological heritage post-marital c'mon<br>man go brantas Tokugawa hey what I reran<br>he took Lee raka know how I can't own<br>toko in one Bruce thank you very much<br>for this presentation it's fascinating<br>to see what you have done since the<br>early 90s when I was looking at the<br>vegetation of Hamilton you might<br>remember yes thank you<br>it's fascinating that you have gone so<br>far and see that the whole ecosystem is<br>incorporated I mean I will be lucky to<br>live rural Tehran out of a rocky road<br>and listen flash down kiwifruit orchard<br>and have a hectic you food so you will<br>be happy about our production but we<br>have the lucky that we live in a gully<br>and plant their effects flexes and it's<br>fascinating and our neighbors are<br>probably similar in vegetation and birds<br>and same flag so we now have also need<br>lots of to you actually I don't think<br>they are breeding in trees in the girly<br>but I'm not sure how<br>let's look like so i fascinate see the<br>potentials because ROP is not that far<br>from Tauranga it's probably for people<br>who know the area I would say or hope is<br>just should be part of the Taronga but I<br>guess the Western Bay is trying to put<br>get the residential settlement in that<br>area that water supply to tower is<br>protected and I'm not sure where I am<br>right in that sense in their city people<br>the City Council and Western Bay they<br>might know what what the plans are for<br>the next 20 years but I've seen really<br>huge potential for getting us here off<br>the ground and do the right things for<br>the whole environment how do you get how<br>do you encourage these these groups to<br>do you know in Torun and groups that you<br>have organized in Hamilton how you had<br>organized that is that mystic City<br>Council is that mr. Ellie we you're<br>asking how we organized ourselves to<br>achieve this so essentially we got<br>together in the case of Wi-Fi curriki we<br>got together in the early 2000s when the<br>first proposal was mooted and we formed<br>a partnership we formed a partnership<br>with the City Council<br>the University of Waikato Wintec with<br>the local hapu which was not ey riri and<br>we got together as a group and started<br>the process as we went along we built<br>more and more partners into the project<br>so environment Waikato as it was then<br>came on board quite quickly that's our<br>Regional Council and progressively been<br>growing it we have a group known as the<br>Friends of Wi-Fi curriki that's a<br>voluntary group that goes there every<br>month and does a lot of the releasing of<br>plants that have been planted so we<br>built in all of the all of the<br>infrastructure if you like to make the<br>project work we also did a lot of work<br>around authentication and verification<br>of eco sourcing nurseries and of course<br>the Hamilton City itself we managed to<br>convince them to become focused on eco<br>sourcing now that took a while too but<br>you know the point here is if you're<br>going to do it you've actually also got<br>to<br>all of the planning and all of the<br>relationship building and you know<br>building with your stakeholders and all<br>of the agencies and bring them together<br>with a collaborative approach and only<br>when you can do that can you survive<br>because of course every three years the<br>council changes right and sometimes you<br>find that the current body of counselors<br>aren't quite as sympathetic as the ones<br>that went before but you know what the<br>community is there forever the e we are<br>there forever it's a matter of getting<br>them all together and mobilizing and<br>partnering and collaborating and getting<br>the result that you seek by sheer<br>persistence and doggedness vision with<br>just time probably for one more time is<br>not on our side over here then do you<br>have anybody a toy or homei that is as<br>enthusiastic it is you that we could get<br>a group going in Tehran could say we<br>have got plenty of areas we can plant in<br>who pays for the plants do you donate<br>them as you go well I'd say but a<br>roomful of people here tonight actually<br>I'm looking around about who's the<br>volunteer but but actually you've got<br>you've got all sorts of people who<br>already exist I know because I've come<br>across them in my travels here in<br>Tauranga I mean I hesitate to name names<br>but I will<br>you've got to load a cup winner here and<br>Rob McGowan you've got another load of<br>cup winner over here Marc Dean I mean<br>what else you know you've got Richard<br>Hart I saw Richard Hart before he's a<br>fantastic expert and in these things<br>there's people all through your<br>community here in Tauranga who could<br>actually get alongside the council and<br>have a crack at some of us why not thank<br>you Bruce Bruce is going to be here<br>afterwards ladies and gentlemen so if<br>you'd like to come and ask my question<br>personally Rob would you just thank<br>Bruce for us thinking well thank you<br>very much<br>for presenting us with a vision and a<br>challenge and the last part that you<br>said yes we have got the people here and<br>there's some amazing things happen did<br>you know that the kind my mama could<br>form was now up and roaring away again<br>we've got about 50 key groups in our<br>catchment around here you know what we<br>have to do is work together and that's<br>the challenge and that's the vision and<br>that's what we're already doing but<br>let's build it up you know this ahmad is<br>saying carrot that we know what color to<br>target when the land is well the people<br>as well we have social problems here the<br>way to an actual fix solve them is to<br>care for our landscape to healed make it<br>well that will make as well the<br>university's really building up here in<br>total we got a wonderful men here in<br>toto<br>Chris Pettis all he's hits the coastal<br>Research Institute you see that big<br>building going up there in town there in<br>gray Street we've got the expertise<br>we've got the people let's really really<br>go for it and make this place even more</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
