Perhaps those living in residential areas had been comforted by the fact that the Department of Conservation and its predecessors have been doing their best to save our native birds from extinction on offshore islands, or more recently, mainland eco-sanctuaries. But, these endeavours on their own, are not enough to reverse the ongoing decline in native biodiversity.<br><br>Professor Bruce Clarkson is Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research at the University of Waikato. He is a restoration ecologist interested in habitat restoration to bring indigenous nature back into towns and cities. Prof Clarkson leads a Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment funded research programme: People, Cities and Nature: restoring indigenous nature in urban environments (https://www.peoplecitiesnature.co.nz/). In 2016 he received the Royal Society of New Zealand Charles Fleming medal for environmental achievement for his efforts to advance and communicate understanding of native plant ecology and vegetation pattern and process, inform conservation efforts in terrestrial, freshwater and urban environments, and support effective on-the-ground restoration practice. He is a board member of the Australasian chapter of the International Society for Ecological Restoration, on the Governance Group for the Building Better Homes, Towns and Cities National Science Challenge, and is ambassador for the New Zealand's Biological Heritage National Science Challenge.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically

katoa<br>time my remedial cope you're coming with<br>a cope up with it to my teen they run<br>later this my pleasure today to actually<br>welcome professor Bruce Clarkson like<br>it's been a long time talking about all<br>his accomplishments and all the<br>positions he's heading still has and go<br>on and on on that would be the whole<br>hell Gong I would think but probably<br>what we most need to know about Bruce is<br>that he really is a man that has his<br>feet on the ground but a deputy<br>vice-chancellor research of what<br>university by college I was really<br>really big time dinner planner can you<br>hear me he really is a min that his his<br>feet on the girl and that's what we most<br>need you know Bruce is from Taranaki his<br>first be job he tells me he was writing<br>a study on Mount Taranaki at the botany<br>of the of the mountain he did that not<br>by consulting other people's research he<br>walked the mountain he climbed the<br>mountain and that's the sort of man that<br>he is a person close to the ground when<br>I was working for the University in<br>Hamilton he had a contract with the<br>Hamilton City Council to do a survey of<br>the biodiversity in Hamilton City and it<br>was a bit of a desert and one of the big<br>features of Hamilton is you've got these<br>wonderful galleries going through where<br>all the weeds in the world have the<br>convenience Hemington is very much a<br>sort of a conference centre of a town<br>and the we said their conferences or<br>used to in the gullies so bruce pointed<br>this out to the council showed them the<br>problem and turned it into a challenge<br>those calories rather than being a<br>problem could be the thing that brings<br>people to Hamilton the solution wasn't<br>with the council all the Regional<br>Council all the Department of<br>Conservation a solution was with the<br>community if a place that's going to be<br>well it's because the community is well<br>informed and really involved with making<br>it happen and that's the sort of thing<br>that Bruce has been leading all around<br>the country that's what we've come to<br>here tonight and so it's my pleasure to<br>welcome you Bruce - to the stage here to<br>talk to us here and today i wanna this<br>is a beautiful city l city our home so<br>let's make it even more beautiful so no<br>dialogue natira canoeing amici aku-aku I<br>know Mikey T in a row he Tonawanda right<br>hanging not Iranian doing naughty<br>picking I mean I even know anyone Yamato<br>canoeing a maquillaje no my are my Reno<br>katate dori tena koutou tena koe no<br>I'm just doing the check yes I did turn<br>the machine on thank you for those kind<br>words Rob and it is a privilege to be<br>here tonight for Bruce Clarkson aho<br>Corps Taranaki to manga for manganui<br>Chihuahua Pacquiao to EE<br>K kirikiriroa inanna in iron a as I said<br>it's a privilege to be here tonight and<br>thank you from that welcome for that<br>welcome Rob I wanted to start at the<br>beginning and when I say the beginning<br>I'm not talking about pre-european<br>although I'd love to spend some time<br>talking pre-european but what I am going<br>to start with is the mention of the<br>first European who really understood<br>what Europeans had done to our flora and<br>fauna and started doing something about<br>it and that's really going to be my<br>message tonight about what we need to do<br>about it<br>so Richard Henry in 1894 took the<br>endangered kakapo and moved it to some<br>offshore islands so it could escape the<br>predation of the stoats the weasels and<br>the rats and his remarkable work was<br>followed on by the New Zealand Wildlife<br>Service Tom Merton as the name that<br>comes to mind for most people and in the<br>1970s they started a conservation<br>program which involved protecting our<br>remarkable birds our fauna on offshore<br>islands it seemed quite logical that<br>that would eventually develop into the<br>dock mainland island program dock formed<br>in 1987 of course and in 1995 they<br>recognized that we needed to move beyond<br>just protecting the more than 220<br>offshore islands of New Zealand and do<br>something about degradation and<br>Klein on mainland New Zealand today we<br>have come to a situation in our tarot<br>New Zealand where there are now 73<br>sanctuaries on mainland New Zealand<br>where people are doing intensive pest<br>control to protect our flora and fauna<br>and the most remarkable thing about it<br>is that 42 of them are essentially<br>community-led yes the government agency<br>the Department of Conservation is<br>sitting in the wings and helping but<br>most importantly New Zealanders have<br>taken responsibility for biodiversity in<br>their own local area I am going to turn<br>now to the topic of my talk which is<br>about the urban environment as I got<br>older and less active Rob you mentioned<br>me climbing mountains well that doesn't<br>happen too often these days as I've got<br>less active I guess I've taken a greater<br>interest in what's in my own backyard<br>and of course we all know that we are<br>living in an increasingly urban world<br>54% of the world's population live in<br>cities and by 2050 its predicted that<br>64% of us will live in towns and cities<br>and cities do big things to all sorts of<br>things resource and biodiversity in<br>particular so London has a ecological<br>footprint 125 times its land area Tokyo<br>has an ecological footprint three times<br>the era of Japan and the average world<br>citizen has an eco footprint of 2.7<br>hectares while they are only 2.1<br>hectares of bio productive land and<br>water per capita on the globe as I<br>wonder who knows who said this famous<br>so earth provides enough to satisfy<br>every man's need but not every man's<br>greed this is sort of the context for<br>some of my talk tonight I'm posing the<br>question really how about we don't look<br>at cities as the problem but we look at<br>them as the potential solution for<br>saving our biodiversity so my talk will<br>be roaming around the topic of nature<br>native plants and animals in particular<br>green space and what we've come to learn<br>is this new concept natural capital a<br>broader concept but before I do that I<br>just wanted to introduce you to this<br>topic of urban ecology urban ecology is<br>a new discipline it's been around for<br>approximately 20 years there are still<br>debates and arguments going on about<br>whether it came out of Germany or the US<br>or the UK but forget that put that<br>behind us the critical thing about urban<br>ecology is it's a news type of ecology<br>an emerging interdisciplinary field that<br>aims to understand how humans and<br>ecological processes can coexist in<br>human dominated systems and of course<br>the goal of urban ecologists is to help<br>societies with their efforts to become<br>more sustainable art era New Zealand we<br>are no different to most parts of the<br>world except we do have a very high<br>proportion of our population that are<br>urban dwellers we don't think of us<br>ourselves that way do we we still think<br>that we're all living out on the farm<br>it's not true it hasn't been true for<br>quite a long time most of our urban<br>centers of course are located around our<br>coastline like particularly particularly<br>like toe Romer I can look out the window<br>right now no I can't they've drawn the<br>curtains and there it is the oceans<br>right nearby I mean that's where most of<br>our cities are there's a few that are<br>inland I come from kirikiriroa Hamilton<br>of course that's an inland and inland<br>city but you know what we call a city in<br>our country of course hardly merits the<br>title internationally we really have<br>only one city in New Zealand the Resta<br>towns<br>let's face it 87% of urban dwellers of a<br>population of 4.6 million and growing<br>our urban areas are rather small and our<br>population densities are low and this<br>should be an opportunity for us you know<br>we're in a better condition than most<br>other parts of<br>well but you know what our record is not<br>great and that last statistic that I<br>bolded they're native vegetation cover<br>in the built-up areas of New Zealand's<br>20 largest urban centers ranges between<br>less than 1% and up to eight point nine<br>percent the city nor the town with the<br>largest proportion of native vegetation<br>remaining in the built-up area is New<br>Plymouth by proportion this is a<br>proportion so we've been trying to<br>understand how biodiversity in urban<br>environments is distributed on the<br>landscape and to do this we've done some<br>work on using various GIS models and the<br>the diagram here is just to show the<br>sort of analysis that we've done we've<br>used the land cover database and we've<br>looked at the distribution of indigenous<br>vegetation on the landscape to trying to<br>get a handle on using indigenous<br>vegetation as a surrogate for our<br>indigenous biodiversity of course that's<br>a big assumption but actually that's<br>really the only database we've got at<br>the moment to do this sort of work<br>anyway the results of some of that work<br>are extremely interesting these are the<br>curve types for New Zealand's twenty<br>largest urban centers I come from one<br>incur a there are seven cities in New<br>Zealand with the flat line curve in<br>other words if you start on the left at<br>the center of the city and work yourself<br>out into the pure urban and rural zone<br>how much indigenous cover remains well<br>the answer in Hamilton kirikiriroa is<br>not much all the way out to out to 20<br>case out from the urban center and then<br>the other cities in New Zealand<br>depending mainly on their topography the<br>roughness of their terrain and their<br>past history at protecting indigenous<br>vegetation had these different curve<br>shapes you can see that Wellington is a<br>c-curve you know that all that high<br>ground around the port there with the<br>town belt that was protected but once<br>you get beyond the town belt you start<br>losing the indigenous vegetation New<br>Plymouth is a strange curve it's the<br>curve shown there curve D a single city<br>in New Zealand so it's got its record<br>amount in the built up part of the city<br>but then it takes a plummeting dive as<br>you move out of the city into the<br>intensive dairy country and only starts<br>to increase as you get closer and closer<br>to the National Park in 1840 the<br>original plan for New Plymouth City had<br>within it a Greenbelt what happened to<br>the Greenbelt<br>they gave it away to Deering right I<br>want you to focus on the axis there and<br>look at the figure ten for ten percent<br>because I'm going to pick up an argument<br>about how much indigenous cover we<br>should actually have in our in urban<br>environments if we are serious about<br>indigenous flora and fauna persisting in<br>an urban environment and I'm just<br>showing you that curb at the moment<br>because I'll pick this up a bit later<br>notice the scale has changed slightly<br>here and you see the distance between<br>five and ten and ten and twenty has been<br>crushed up to fit but the curve there<br>but notice in the from zero through to<br>ten kilometers he was still below 13.8%<br>threshold and the data for Taronga shows<br>that taking the whole area only three<br>percent of Tauranga has indigenous<br>vegetation cover so where is this<br>leading me it's leading me into this<br>argument so the argument here is I've<br>been living in the red zone for most of<br>my life I've been living first in<br>Taranaki which is a star there showing<br>the red zone these are parts of the<br>country where indigenous cover has been<br>reduced to less than 10% of the area<br>and of course I moved up to Hamilton and<br>guess what I continued to work in the<br>redzone and toe Runner I don't have a<br>star on it but you can see where it is<br>and it's got a bit of red around it and<br>so what this is saying is that these are<br>the places that have been most impacted<br>by human development of course that<br>seems a bit straightforward except that<br>in the Taranaki herb case of course it's<br>the whole of the volcanic ring plane and<br>the whole of the Deering intense<br>steering country that has removed our<br>natural biodiversity so where am i<br>leading and this is where I'm leading<br>this is the science behind the loss of<br>species these are species area decay<br>curves and what they show if you look at<br>the figures along the bottom axis at the<br>point<br>0.10 that is the 10% threshold and what<br>it shows is that once you get below the<br>10% threshold we lose species out of all<br>proportion to the total area that they<br>once lived in so again I'm coming back<br>to the argument if you are serious about<br>protecting flora and fauna and you want<br>them to persist on the landscape no<br>matter what you do if you dipping below<br>the 10% you are up against it fully up<br>against it and why 10%<br>well it's I'm saying it's semi arbitrary<br>there's a lot of science sitting behind<br>it and there was actually a recent paper<br>published in 2017 in the New Zealand<br>journal of ecology which points the<br>finger squarely at the need where cover<br>is near or below five to ten percent<br>fear the forest clearance in these low<br>cover landscapes as likely to have<br>impacts on native bird communities while<br>even small increases note that statement<br>small increases in forest cover may<br>produce large benefits so now I'm going<br>to sort of work my case study to show<br>you what is possible in a place that is<br>well be<br>the 10% threshold and what can be done<br>to help fix the problem so there's good<br>old Pierre Akira Hamilton sitting in the<br>middle of the indigenous biodiversity<br>desert surrounded on all sides by<br>important agricultural primary<br>production which is you know<br>contributing to our living but has<br>basically removed right down to the last<br>1.6 percent of indigenous vegetation<br>remaining in the whole of the Hamilton<br>basin and within the city itself less<br>than 2% indigenous vegetation cover a<br>beautiful city nevertheless with the<br>mighty Waikato running right through the<br>middle of it and bisecting the city and<br>yes quite a lot of green cover but the<br>question is what have we done to look<br>after our own indigenous flora and fauna<br>when subdivisions occur and now and in<br>the past have occurred in Hamilton they<br>have been devastating for indigenous<br>flora and fauna even though we were<br>already down at that last 2% development<br>continues to chip away at and remove the<br>last examples the last potential for how<br>we might protect our indigenous cover<br>the image on the bottom left 1967 is the<br>1967 black-and-white photograph it's a<br>bit hard probably to see from the back<br>which shows the view across the Hamilton<br>gully where bear my wife who's here with<br>me tonight and I live and what it used<br>to look like in 1967<br>you can still see in that photograph<br>traces of fences because actually the<br>gully at that stage was grazed by<br>grazing animals and it was also the<br>location of a tire dump from the local<br>garage when they'd run the tires had<br>worn out they just tossed them in the<br>gully and the person who built their<br>home there in ten years or so ago found<br>that out to their costs when they tried<br>to put the pole<br>down for the house and they went into<br>the ground hit the tires and bounced<br>straight back up so anyway massive<br>because the point about subdivisions as<br>subdivisions are the opportunity to<br>build green space and indigenous<br>vegetation into the system don't don't<br>just destroy it all at that point so<br>Hamilton City has very little to work<br>with we have 67 key sites in Hamilton<br>City and they're mean sizes 1.1 hectare<br>so we have way less existing resource<br>than Tehran that does currently and I'll<br>get onto that a little bit later but<br>here they are the gems of Hamilton<br>kirakira the one at the top left is our<br>last remnant of our kakatiya semi swamp<br>forest at clawed lands bush and the one<br>at the bottom left is hammond bush where<br>we still have power and we still have a<br>matte eye and we have in particular why<br>walker or swamp miry the last remaining<br>stand in the whole city so the picture<br>on the right shows out the current<br>condition of clawed lands bush and of<br>course it's being looked after to the<br>max it's only five point two hectares<br>it's in size it has an understory and a<br>ground cover now completely removed of<br>tradescantia it is pristine it is as<br>good as you will ever get in our tiara<br>New Zealand so we know lots about how to<br>restore existing patches of native<br>vegetation<br>it's simply around fencing them removing<br>weeds and pests and buffering them in<br>various ways but above all it's also<br>about when they're particularly small<br>patches about expanding them and<br>connecting them to adjoining patches and<br>in cities like the one where I love<br>hamilton napier and Hastings and<br>Christchurch reconstruction is of an<br>retrofitting of indigenous habitats as<br>needed in other cities you need both<br>restoration and reconstruction I'm going<br>to get to explaining the difference<br>between restoration and reconstruction<br>shortly here we go<br>reconstruction reconstruction is a is<br>about building new habitat from scratch<br>because if you have insufficient habitat<br>and you can't make the 10% threshold<br>because you have insufficient habitat<br>remaining you need to do actively do<br>something about it you need to build new<br>habitat so it's about moving beyond<br>revegetation it's about having a<br>knowledge of target ecosystems and<br>habitats about full assemblages and<br>species occupancy and about building<br>habitat for all components of the<br>ecosystem not just bird's habitat<br>reconstruction is best done using a<br>natural succession framework learning<br>from nature and mimicking nature to<br>rebuild habitats this idea is reasonably<br>old ad Bradshaw in 1983 threw the<br>challenge out to ecologists saying well<br>actually the ultimate challenge for you<br>ecologists is to reconstruct ecosystems<br>because if you can't reconstruct them<br>you don't even know how they<br>do you this is the ultimate challenge<br>and some of us have tried to take up<br>this challenge so we've been looking to<br>link natural succession frameworks and<br>recovery to restoration and<br>reconstruction and to do this we apply<br>the successional framework pioneer trees<br>first mid term intermediate succession<br>species second late succession that late<br>successional species later in the<br>planting process understanding the<br>different constraints and opportunities<br>presented by the environment and<br>understanding the environmental drivers<br>that make the system work and that's<br>what i'm going to continue to amplify<br>our hope as we go now right Rob very<br>kindly introduced you to the notion of a<br>Hamilton gully this is the archetypal<br>Hamilton gully there is all the houses<br>the subdivision a suburban area and<br>there's our gullies 5,000 years ago<br>because of the deep down cutting of the<br>Waikato River and a process known as<br>spring sapping these gullies were formed<br>of course there are very few clues today<br>about what used to be in the gully and<br>the name of course as the giveaway here<br>this is one of the main reasons we need<br>to take much more of pay much more<br>attention to mato runner because we can<br>learn so much about the previous<br>landscape and use that information to<br>inform our restoration processes so the<br>Munger court took kukuku gully named<br>after our native tree fuchsia court<br>acutally the fuchsia the tree fuchsia<br>Hamilton gullies are largely filled<br>however with all of the rubbish and all<br>of the weeds known to humankind<br>but the pointers they provide a place<br>where we can do something about bringing<br>back our indigenous flora and fauna now<br>there is some indigenous flora and fauna<br>even within these exotic dominated what<br>some people call novel<br>Galia vegetation I prefer not to use the<br>word novel I didn't see anything<br>exciting about them at all actually they<br>do not provide the ecosystem services<br>needed to maintain our indigenous flora<br>and fauna occasionally they'll be the<br>Ruru<br>still lurking in there but the willow<br>itself is no good for our nectar feeding<br>birds and so we have adopted target<br>ecosystems for the Hamilton gulley<br>rather like this and we have been<br>working towards trying to reinstate<br>these ecosystems in Hamilton gullies so<br>our major target ecosystem is the<br>kakatiya Bukhatir swamp miry forest and<br>then of course what are all the things<br>that should be there with it where are<br>all the birds and where are all the<br>insects in Hamilton why walker or swamp<br>Murray is a very important component of<br>it and we are really worried at the<br>moment about what might the likely<br>impact be of Myrtle rust because why<br>walker or swamp wari will be susceptible<br>to Myrtle rust and it's one of our key<br>ingredients for restoration it's one of<br>our few native trees that can give Green<br>Goddess and Arum Lily and all of those<br>other weeds are run for its money<br>so the question leaners well okay what<br>have you been doing and has it worked<br>well we've been doing restoration and<br>Hamilton gullies for quite a long time<br>now and the two photographs are just<br>some examples of the sort of restoration<br>that's been done on the left the Munger<br>et gully where we have an early<br>successional Cooper wetland community<br>dominated by the caraxes after seven<br>years of work and the one on the right<br>is a 20 year old restoration it's<br>actually now been going for 25 years or<br>more this is our backyard babes backyard<br>and my backyard well we've been doing<br>this work in our own backyard and we<br>have the beginnings of a kahikatea our<br>akechi semi swamp forest well<br>established by now but of course we<br>weren't the first<br>to do this there have been many other<br>people who've been doing this longer in<br>Hamilton City and this is probably the<br>record site if you like because the<br>oldest plantings in a small gully called<br>sillies gully now up to 55 years old in<br>some places and at the minimum<br>throughout the gully 40 plus years of<br>work so this was the site in November of<br>a few years ago I think it was now of an<br>ecological society field trip that was<br>run to the gully to show our<br>international visitors and our visitors<br>from other parts of New Zealand how far<br>have we come now we didn't tell them<br>that this was a recreated gully we<br>didn't tell them that it was artificial<br>in a sense that had been planted by<br>human beings and was not a natural<br>existing forest patch and we took them<br>to the site and asked them to assess<br>this in terms of kakatiya forests they<br>were familiar with I can't read you and<br>I won't try to read you all of the<br>commentary they're on Instagram see how<br>socially media up-to-date I am that was<br>flying around at the time but in short<br>what these people said was this is a<br>fantastic idea forests it must be<br>natural while actually it wasn't it was<br>created and and I think the message<br>there is that yes even in the face of<br>all of those weeds we can do it<br>so in Hamilton once we've sort of got<br>the gully stuff off the ground we<br>started thinking more broadly because<br>just doing restoration or reconstruction<br>in a gully is not going to be enough for<br>Hamilton City mainly because the gully<br>is a particular type of habitat<br>you know the gully bottom and the swampy<br>bottom is not the same as having good<br>examples at the more widely across the<br>city landscape and so in the early 2000s<br>a millennium approach<br>it was proposed to create a new Park<br>just to the northwest and right next to<br>the Hamilton Zoo on the edge of Hamilton<br>City it took a lot of work to convince<br>all of the councillors on the council<br>that actually you could hand this public<br>land over to the community and they<br>would really look after it and do<br>something worthwhile so after a long<br>period of debate by 2004 the first tree<br>was planted over and this is an area of<br>60 hectares the target symbol on the<br>right is some land 5.1 hectares that has<br>been added recently after a bit of a<br>tussle with the councillors who wanted<br>to sell the public land to the private<br>developer a tussle that we won and their<br>map shows the variety of different<br>ecosystems or target ecosystems that are<br>being developed at the site all the way<br>from quarry Konica forests on the ridges<br>right the way down to the kakatiya semi<br>swamp forests on the lower slopes and of<br>course the aquatic environment of the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
