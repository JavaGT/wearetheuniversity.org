Palmer thank you very<br>much for coming and also her husband<br>Andrew now unfortunately professor<br>Palmer's parents professor David Green<br>and Sarah Rees won't be joining us<br>tonight because they are overseas but I<br>actually personally know her parents<br>very well having lived next door to them<br>in Dunedin for almost a decade so I'm<br>very certain like all of us who are<br>gathered here in Christchurch this<br>evening that they are also extremely<br>proud of your achievement now the rank<br>of professor at the University of Otago<br>really marks the pinnacle of academic<br>achievement and it is only achieved on<br>the back of sustained excellence in<br>teaching in research and in service when<br>we're considering an application for<br>promotion to professor we not only<br>assess the applicants success by our own<br>University of Otago high standards but<br>we also seek the views of international<br>experts so when we saw outside<br>endorsement for professor Palmer's<br>application we heard things like there<br>is no question in my mind that dr.<br>Palmer has met the criteria for a full<br>professor at your university or any top<br>university in the world<br>we also heard the body of Professor<br>Palmer's work is heavily cited and is<br>used by all of the major guide line<br>committees to inform care the<br>conclusions from her work have resulted<br>in reduction in the use of unproven<br>therapies reduction in harm to patients<br>and an increased recognition of<br>important and unanswered questions for<br>research so professor Palmer on behalf<br>of the University of Otago I would like<br>to warmly congratulate you on your very<br>well-deserved promotion nah man he knew<br>it yeah quit I will now call on<br>professor David Murdoch the Dean of the<br>University of Otago Christchurch to tell<br>us just a little bit more about your<br>academic history nor era tena koe tu<br>tena koe tu tena tato tena koe tu Katara<br>and good evening and thank you Helen and<br>it's my great pleasure to be able to<br>introduce my job is to introduce it's<br>way Tony Palmer to you tonight<br>swear Tony I grew up in although born in<br>the UK was brought up in Dunedin and<br>went to University of Otago School of<br>Medicine graduating in 1995 she then<br>worked as a junior doctor in<br>Invercargill and Christchurch and I<br>gather was during a and the frolla G<br>attachment probably here in Christchurch<br>as a junior doctor that sparked her<br>interest in kidney diseases and how they<br>affect people's lives as many doctors<br>that then and still doomed that<br>beforehand - they spent some time<br>overseas traveling and the UK returned<br>to New Zealand back here to Christchurch<br>to start training as a physician and a<br>nephrologist and it was at that time in<br>fact for most and that all specialties<br>in medicine require trainees to<br>undertake some research and looking for<br>projects and using swear Tony's own<br>words she would try a hand at a Cochrane<br>review now some of you will know what a<br>Cochrane review is and some of you won't<br>and I suspect swear Tony might explain a<br>little bit about what they are but<br>needless to say these are reviews that<br>facilitate the evidence base for choices<br>with health interventions that will help<br>health professionals patients and policy<br>makers make good decisions and at that<br>time she worked with the Cochrane group<br>in Sydney and in partnership with her<br>who was then an Italian PhD student<br>called Giovanni's Tripoli and that led<br>to a<br>productive collaboration the longest<br>collaboration elsewhere Tony's head in<br>fact I searched on PubMed last night and<br>in fact there are a hundred eight papers<br>with both partners and street olive as<br>there's authors so certainly has been a<br>very productive collaboration first<br>major paper was a meta-analysis that<br>showed that the commonly used medication<br>vitamin D was of it was little evidence<br>for its use in kidney disease it was<br>published in the annals of internal<br>medicine and then she went on and joined<br>the Christchurch Heart Institute here to<br>do a PhD under mark Richard so a very<br>nurturing and productive environment<br>lent the joys of some laboratory based<br>research page participant recruitment<br>grappling with statistics and that would<br>that work was supported by a fellowship<br>from the Health Research Council<br>following that she went to Boston two<br>years as a postdoctoral fellow at<br>Harvard Medical School and Brigham and<br>Williams hast a woman's hospital which I<br>understand was the first was where the<br>first kidney transplant was performed in<br>1957 returned to Christchurch one month<br>before the 2011 earthquakes so return to<br>first academic job at a very chaotic<br>time in Christchurch and I think those<br>of us who are around at the time<br>remember all those staff members who<br>joined about that time and how they<br>really so many I think all of them stuck<br>around really helping us through that<br>period but it wasn't quite a chaotic<br>time but where Tonia's career has really<br>been on a very steep upward trajectory<br>from that time and really developed<br>expertise and meta analysis was very<br>really clear during that time special<br>focus on the benefits and harms of<br>commonly used medications and killing<br>disease diabetes hypertension<br>and these were recognized by quite a<br>number of awards so I can read some of<br>them here not in 2012 the first New<br>Zealand woman to receive the Loreal<br>UNESCO for women and science award for<br>Australia New Zealand 2013 rather the<br>discovery fellowship from the Royal<br>Society of New Zealand 2016 in HRC 25th<br>anniversary emerging researcher prize<br>for excellence research quality and<br>leadership and then some of Otago awards<br>along the way so in 2015 the Cal Smith<br>middle and Rohith trust prize and then<br>this year the University of Otago<br>Christchurch gold medal for research<br>excellence so I'm actually we're<br>actually going to after swear Tony's<br>lecture we actually go into a award<br>those medals and I'll explain the<br>reasons for that later on a lot of<br>service work on a reactive officer for<br>of the Australian New Zealand Society of<br>Nephrology chair obvious Australia New<br>Zealand renal guideline steering<br>committee writes the annual nephrology<br>activity report on care quality and<br>practices for the Ministry of Health and<br>the editor with Cochrane kidney<br>transplant as well as that she works as<br>a as in the Frollo gist consultant<br>nephrologist for the canape District<br>Health Board and this year took on the<br>role of deputy head of our biggest<br>Department Department of Medicine which<br>is is a big role in itself so I saw some<br>with it switch when I called herself in<br>this order a meta analyst and<br>nephrologist and I actually looked at I<br>could find at least 67 meta-analyses in<br>21 Cochrane reviews linked to you so I<br>think that really shows quite a body of<br>work it shows your expertise but it's a<br>good segue into your talk this evening<br>which is on travels and critical<br>thinking how evidence-based medicine is<br>changing so it's where tonyia invite you<br>to<br>thank you very much<br>tena koutou katoa cor Primrose Hill team<br>Unga core teams to our young orangutan<br>or Tokyo to Pune in our eco anaronnie<br>Tofino otaku fauna Tonga metalita my<br>titania eat ito 1978 Kihara<br>ochio tiara Inari<br>ETP area I wrote OH -

Emily Cedarburg who was the first<br>female medical graduate in New Zealand<br>and she went to Otago Girls and her<br>picture was on the wall that we walked<br>past every day as school students and<br>I'm sure that kind of normalized the<br>fact that women just did that kind of<br>stuff and this is a tiger girl students<br>doing gymnastics outside which kind of<br>doesn't sound that profound now but in<br>those days that was pretty<br>forward-thinking out there so the school<br>was always something that took girls<br>education totally seriously and made it<br>a big thing for us I did Otago science<br>fair and this is my project from 2008<br>1988 I think I missed my mark because I<br>think I should have been a climate<br>scientist the project Dunedin is under<br>threat in the category senior biological<br>display and it was awarded by the<br>ministry for the environment so here we<br>go but my real interest actually and<br>research arose from meeting patients who<br>have kidney disease hearing what they go<br>through<br>seeing their incredible resilience<br>watching them grow and meet the<br>challenges that kidney disease makes<br>them face and some of them you know it's<br>tough times and the other ones really<br>that have made you know my interest in<br>research last the distance a hundred and<br>eight gosh<br>so the first scientific paper I did was<br>it was a case report and it was I was<br>working with Professor Rob Walker and<br>Dunedin as a young nephrology trainee I<br>didn't know about research back then but<br>what Rob taught me was the importance of<br>careful observation putting it on paper<br>explaining it to someone else in<br>publishing it and I won't forget that<br>and also John some of you may recognize<br>John Dunbar who's an orthopedic surgeon<br>in Dunedin so I'm proud to say that my<br>first research collaboration was with an<br>orthopedic surgeon and so between them<br>they helped me create something that I<br>was incredibly proud of at the time as<br>has been alluded to already we have to<br>do research projects as you know<br>training to be physicians and we have to<br>do three so once I've done my case<br>report I was on the scrounge for the<br>next topic and you know when you're<br>young you actually don't have the<br>research ideas you can't think of things<br>that you should be researching so I<br>wonder them the corridor to dr. Marc the<br>sales office it did I really need to do<br>a project and I actually don't know what<br>to do and his reply which I think will<br>go down in my little research history is<br>I have a Cochrane list of ideas on my<br>desk but do you want to do one of those<br>so he literally Cochrane and I'll<br>explain Cochrane in a minute for those<br>of you who are not bet aware of it used<br>to send out a little pamphlet of ideas<br>about what people<br>around the world could do so there was a<br>list of topics and he just kind of gave<br>it to me and said knock yourself out go<br>and do that so I'm just gonna take a<br>brief side shoot here and just explain<br>what trials are and why meta-analysis is<br>really important to the way that we<br>think about medicines and how we treat<br>people and some of you in the audience<br>are very familiar with vitamin C but<br>back in the 1700s the British Navy<br>actually couldn't go very far they<br>couldn't conquer too many lands because<br>of the limitation of the fact that the<br>sailors or Navy sailors didn't have a<br>supply of vitamin C they didn't know it<br>was vitamin C at the time and vitamin C<br>wasn't actually discovered until last<br>century and they would get scurvy so<br>basically their tissues would break down<br>they'll get bleeding mouth and you know<br>horrible sores and become limp and die<br>and in fact the mortality rate for large<br>naval expert expeditions on the British<br>Navy was 90% they didn't die of cannon<br>fodder they died of scurvy and this very<br>fine gentleman has a bit of a hero of<br>mine as dr. James Lind who was a<br>Scottish physician and there was a<br>theory going around that maybe it was<br>something that the soul and sailors were<br>eating that might help so he took and<br>this is a description of really the<br>first clinical trial that I think we've<br>been able to find he took 12 patients<br>and the scurvy the cases were as similar<br>as I could have them they all in general<br>had gums spots<br>lessa tude was weakness of knees they<br>lay together on one place being a proper<br>apartment for sick in the fall hold and<br>had one diet common to all so he was<br>trying to control for confounding<br>variables so he had them all kind of<br>tucked into the for hold 12 of them<br>what he did was he peered them up so he<br>had six lots of two sailors and he gave<br>them different medicines or different<br>things to try and see what would make a<br>difference I feel really sorry for the<br>guys that got the course of seawater I<br>don't actually know what elixir vitriol<br>is and some of them were lucky enough to<br>get a quart of cider but that didn't<br>work an illiterate I had to go and<br>Google this as a mixture with honey in<br>it so that sounds super delicious and it<br>was given to them by an Hospital surgeon<br>so it must be the right thing right but<br>actually took the guys that got two<br>lemons uh two oranges in a lemon were<br>right as rain within six days and back<br>up on their feet and the others weren't<br>what's really interesting was that<br>didn't actually get embedded within<br>naval practice for another forty years<br>so it just goes to show you we neg an<br>egg about implementing clinical evidence<br>but it was a problem right from right<br>from the very start and in fact the<br>Naval Institute has a lemon tree as its<br>symbol in honor of dr. Lin's amazing<br>work so the next part of the story is<br>when we've got trials we need to think<br>about them systematically and<br>collectively and this lovely charming<br>looking man is Archie Cochrane and in<br>1972 he looks really nice but he told us<br>all off mightily he wrote a book which<br>said we had all of these treatments<br>available to us we have a huge number of<br>trials and we're all just a bit of a<br>mess really<br>we're not systematically applying the<br>evidence that we have and we need to<br>stop and look at the trials and<br>systematically collect them and<br>understand what they mean<br>and this is the symbol of Cochran so<br>it's 2 C's Cochrane Collaboration and<br>the purple lines are trials so each of<br>them as an individual trial and at the<br>bottom is the diamond which tells us<br>whether that treatment was effective so<br>on this if it's on this side it might<br>mean that that that the treatment is<br>effective and if it's on the other line<br>might mean that the placebo is effective<br>and this was the first Cochrane misser<br>analysis and it was really lovely<br>because it had a real strong New Zealand<br>connection because it was a set of<br>trials looking at with a premature women<br>at women who were about to give birth to<br>a premature baby whether giving them<br>steroids would help protect their child<br>against respiratory distress<br>when they were born and so by collecting<br>all of those trials together<br>collectively it was shown very clearly<br>that steroids saved babies lives and<br>reduced hospitalization and so that's<br>now standard practice and it was the<br>systematic block of the trials that<br>allowed that knowledge to be understood<br>and Cochran's gone viral since then so<br>it's basically a crowdsourcing loos'd<br>collaboration of people who all do their<br>work for free so you join up and you do<br>these analyses for Cochrane for free and<br>you don't have to have a medical degree<br>but there's a very very rigorous peer<br>review process throughout the whole<br>process to make sure the scientific<br>quality and my copy editor when she<br>refused my Cochrane reviews she writes<br>on the bottom how long it took her to do<br>them and usually it takes 150 or 160<br>hours and she's kind of reminding me<br>that I need to just pay very careful<br>attention when I'm actually doing a<br>review so I'm just going to talk very<br>quickly about the importance of<br>systematic reviews and why we need to<br>understand what we've<br>what's gone in the past before we can<br>know what's going on in the future and<br>this is a very simple example so we have<br>and you know if you present a hospital<br>with a heart attack you've got a clot in<br>your artery and here we have the line up<br>of all the trials looking at<br>streptokinase which is a clot busting<br>treatment against for SIBO between 1959<br>and 1988 and at the bottom you can see<br>there's a tiny little diamond at the<br>bottom which tells us that stricte<br>kinase reduce the risk of death by 25%<br>complete with placebo that's fantastic<br>what a great thing tested body of work<br>what we can do is look at those trials<br>cumulatively and it gives us a<br>completely different story if we end one<br>trial to the trial that's just done<br>before and then add the next child to<br>the body of work that's just gone before<br>it what we can see is that we knew that<br>streptokinase reduced death after only<br>960 people went into randomised trials<br>back in 1971 and what we did<br>collectively because we actually hadn't<br>done this systematic review as we<br>collectively continue to do trials for<br>another 20-30 years and we got more and<br>more certain about our result it kept on<br>giving us the same result but the<br>problem is that 36,000 people went into<br>these trials and half of those got<br>placebo when we knew we could have known<br>that placebo was not as good as getting<br>active drug so this was kind of my<br>inspiration at some level of the need to<br>do systematic review why it's just so<br>important so we then started combining<br>kidney trials so this is where me coming<br>in to measure analysis is and this is<br>the first problem we tackled so dr.<br>Sewell gave me that list and I went away<br>and I liked this one so for those of you<br>who are not familiar that's saline<br>gomez on the right and she's a famous<br>actor and artist and musician and she<br>has lupus and she needed a kidney<br>transplant I don't think she<br>announcement after she had the<br>transplant I think she put it on<br>Instagram and this is her kidney donor<br>who was a friend and musician and this<br>must be them I think about to go into<br>theater transplantation is just an<br>absolute miracle it transforms lives I<br>think it's the coolest thing we do in<br>Christchurch Hospital to be honest but<br>the long-term consequences of treatment<br>tough down the line a lot of cancers and<br>one of the main issues is actually bone<br>disease the bones can become quite thin<br>related to long-term steroids so dr.<br>Sewell handed over my supervision to dr.<br>McGregor<br>I think dr. Sewell wasn't quite sure if<br>I was going to cut the mustard so he<br>passed me on to dr. McGregor and David<br>kind of helped me through the first<br>process this was before we could click<br>and just go online and look at PDF so I<br>actually had to go to the library<br>I had a photocopy card that was<br>constantly needing topping up and I<br>scurried through and found all the<br>trials looking at the treatment of bone<br>disease for people who are having a<br>transplant and this is just a small<br>example of the trials that I found and<br>Andrew my husband are diligently<br>scanning them all and I still get emails<br>from international colleagues saying you<br>know at trial do you still have a copy<br>of it and I'll flick it off so that was<br>the way it was done way back when or was<br>15 years ago and what we discovered was<br>well we found 23 trials they had 1,200<br>people in them and how it's really<br>surprised it's a junior doctor I thought<br>you know everything that we all<br>treatments that you were used had a you<br>know a strong evidence base I was really<br>surprised that no trial found any<br>treatment that<br>she reduces the risk for fracture we've<br>just updated this actually just it's<br>almost impressed when we finally found<br>that that one one treatment does but<br>it's taken another 15 years to discover<br>that and it's so right they've been<br>pointed out along with David was my my<br>first collaboration with Giovanni's<br>Tripoli who's now a fine professor and<br>Italy but back then was the PhD student<br>that was attached to me to get me to do<br>the systematic review and we I'm off to<br>Italy it's tough I'm off to Italy again<br>in November we it's it's really thin<br>test that the Italians believe very<br>strongly and maintaining you know<br>personal relationships and and<br>researchers about as much about<br>relationships and I learned a lot from<br>Giovanni for that and so we still make a<br>huge effort to you know be in touch and<br>work together face to face which is<br>wonderful because he lives in Puglia<br>which is an incredible place in Italy to<br>be so my next stop was a PhD I<br>tentatively knocked on the door of Mark<br>Richards who I was amazed agreed to take<br>me on and there was a wonderful three<br>years I was very lucky to get an HRC<br>fellowship because I was a junior doctor<br>and I you know head commitment and then<br>HRC the fellowship was the thing that<br>allowed me to kind of down my<br>stethoscope and go and do you know<br>proper every day all day at research and<br>mark very kindly and the gum the cardio<br>endocrine research group when it was<br>called back then open the databases to<br>me and I remember covering in my boots<br>every time I had a Supervisors meeting<br>with mark<br>because he was a stickler for<br>articulating your position knowing what<br>you were all about explaining what you<br>were trying to do he was incredibly<br>supportive in terms of boosting you up<br>and helping you but he he had high<br>expectations and I think there's nothing<br>that can take the place of that so we've<br>been one side and I'm not going to<br>ponder on on the PhD research it was<br>absolutely fantastic but I'm going to<br>move on to the next meta-analysis just<br>to explain kind of the things that we<br>found that have really changed guideline<br>practice around the world<br>so just in brief we all go outside to<br>take the sunlight don't we and let's go<br>and get my vitamin D vitamin D comes<br>into our skin it allows our body to<br>create pre vitamin D this is a very<br>short version of vitamin D metabolism<br>you'll be pleased to know our liver the<br>interns are into vitamin D but our<br>kidneys are fantastic and that they<br>activate it and when our kidneys fail<br>what happens is that our bodies move the<br>council around in all the wrong places<br>so we end up with very thin brittle<br>bones and bones that hurt and bones that<br>Bend and we end up with arteries that<br>look like bones so they turn in concrete<br>and as a result we've you know we've<br>thought over the time well if we just<br>replace active vitamin D they don't kind<br>of switch off all of these problems that<br>we have so much so that vitamin D has<br>become a billion-dollar industry around<br>the world and it costs about half a<br>billion to the US medical care each year<br>so what did we do well we looked we went<br>and we found all the trials and I just<br>want to acknowledge here Professor<br>Jonathan Craig who was the head of<br>Cochran when I started and he's still<br>the head of Cochran he's an incredible<br>thing he's a Christchurch boy he's a<br>pediatric nephrologist and he's just so<br>smart and so in size<br>of an his thinking and this was the<br>first collaboration that I was that I<br>had with Jonathan and what did we find<br>while you're kind of getting a theme<br>here now I'm sure we found 73 trials and<br>we found no evidence that vitamin D made<br>any difference to the really important<br>things that we worry about death bone<br>pain vascular calcification so despite<br>this incredible international effort<br>looking at vitamin D when we pause and<br>look at the trials we don't find strong<br>evidence to support what we do and it<br>kind of led to an editorial which said<br>that vitamin D is of unproven benefit<br>that doesn't mean it doesn't work it's<br>just that we're not really very sure<br>whether it does or not the kidneys<br>pretty flesh it filters materials it<br>produces vitamin D and it also produces<br>a rougher poison and a rough report and<br>tells our bone marrow to produce red<br>blood cells and increase oxygen around<br>the body and when we don't have that our<br>hemoglobin can go to our boots and I'm<br>sure professor Lin here who's been a<br>nephrologist for many many years well<br>very well remember the days before birth<br>report and where patients had<br>hemoglobins of 40 very very low they<br>still build houses and get on with their<br>lives and they had lots of blood<br>transfusions and there's also evidence<br>that an emu is associated with some bad<br>things in our bodies that can be<br>associated with heart failure obviously<br>you feel pretty terrible when your<br>hemoglobins and your boots and this guy<br>found a really good use for a reporter<br>he didn't tell us about it for a while<br>yeah um a nurse reports big business and<br>the state's two billion dollars per<br>annum that was ten years ago I think<br>things have changed a little since then<br>and I'll tell you why so we did a<br>measure analysis and we looked at all<br>the trials compared<br>yep Oh more Ipoh with Leslie PO actually<br>and we found that by 1998 so eight years<br>after the first trial we actually should<br>have known at that point that<br>erythropoietin probably wasn't there<br>were some signals that it was<br>problematic for our patients and that we<br>probably should be using less of it and<br>interestingly as through that previous<br>example we keep going for another 20<br>years because we hadn't done this<br>meta-analysis and this measuring that<br>you know those trials were done well<br>before Cochrane kidney transplant was<br>off and running in such as goes to show<br>we just keep need to keep on it in this<br>that meta-analysis and other similar<br>work lead to a blackbox warning by the<br>Food and Drug Administration in the u.s.<br>that we really needed to rethink how<br>much of this drug we used Lance<br>Armstrong certainly does and in actually<br>the use of this drug has dramatically<br>fallen over time and we use it in quite<br>different ways now we use enough to help<br>our patients feel better and do the<br>things so long but we don't use so much<br>that we worry about their side effects<br>so my next stop is was introduced was<br>that I was lucky enough to get some<br>funding to go to postdoctoral program at<br>Harvard Medical School and Brigham and<br>Women's and I just had just the most<br>fantastic time I learned about Western<br>peace yeah yes I do know how to do those<br>things and it was an incredibly<br>influential time Grand Rounds Nobel<br>Prize when it is to just turn up and<br>talk to us it was an incredibly amazing<br>environment and it was the the hospital<br>with the first kidney transplant I<br>actually turned up about a month after<br>Obama had been inaugurated and a month<br>before Brigham did the first it wasn't<br>the first world's first face transplant<br>but what was Brigham's<br>first face transplant<br>and so they would just pioneers they've<br>just got no fear I arrived back and yes<br>I we taught students in the Headley golf<br>course and oh it was crazy wasn't it<br>yeah so I arrived back to a wonderful<br>person actually I should say thank you<br>because I had the post I came back to<br>before I left so I didn't need to spend<br>my postdoc filling out forms worrying<br>about interviews wondering where I was<br>going to go next I actually had this<br>post to come back to and that was an<br>immense opportunity to actually just get<br>my head into the space of my postdoc so<br>once I came back we did some more me to<br>analysis and these really were on a much<br>larger scale than we've done before so<br>one of them looked at the problem of<br>phosphate so we we ate phosphate all the<br>time it's particularly in coca-cola and<br>certain foods we absorb it across our<br>gut but when we've got kidney failure we<br>don't get rid of it and so it climbs<br>onto the back of calcium and together<br>they make concrete and we concrete our<br>blood vessels when we have kidney<br>failure and we have vascular<br>calcification and there was a great<br>there's you know been a great effort to<br>try and treat that in people by binding<br>phosphate out of their gut getting rid<br>of it using their very large medications<br>we asked people to take them two or<br>three times a day they hate them and<br>what difference does it make<br>so we we got this paper in JAMA and in<br>fact I was doing the copy edits as the<br>large aftershocks rocked through and my<br>my computer would power down from time<br>to time and I had two days to get the<br>copy at its back but we got there and<br>what we showed was we managed to<br>accumulate data from a third of a<br>million<br>and we showed that phosphate wasn't as<br>important as we thought it was in terms<br>of its impact on people's future lives<br>so it's still important but it's not as<br>big as we thought<br>and so the Swinton's of the global<br>guidelines thing there's an absence of<br>data supporting our efforts to maintain<br>phosphate within the normal range and<br>that has allowed us actually to use less<br>treatment I think to to reduce phosphate<br>and I'll talk about this a little bit<br>later on because we need to do a<br>randomized trial and that's part of our<br>plan one of our next ones was does<br>lowering cholesterol have any impact so<br>we're on a roll here our patients we all<br>want to live healthy lives we all want<br>to eat well we know that cholesterol<br>might be bad for us<br>and but what we wanted to know was if we<br>treat cholesterol and people with kidney<br>disease is that going to make an impact<br>on their lives because there was some<br>evidence that statins might be helpful<br>and I think this is a wonderful example<br>of our patients trying to do everything<br>they can for themselves and there's<br>actually an emerging evidence that<br>exercise for dialysis patients is ecchi<br>makes a big difference to mood and<br>well-being and I think we need some more<br>exercise Charles to be honest but we<br>looked at statins<br>it's a statins lower blood cholesterol<br>and we found 80 trials and 50,000 people<br>and we found that statins actually don't<br>make a lot of difference to people on<br>dialysis so that means that's one less<br>tablet that they might want to take and<br>this went into the global guidelines as<br>well an adult straight of the dialysis<br>we suggest that statins aren't used and<br>so that immediately can reduce the costs<br>that we have to to our patients we then<br>went to the next level which was Network<br>meta-analysis and I'll just to explain<br>this this rather wonderful professor<br>George's salon T who's at the University<br>of Bern and it she and she got a great<br>l'oréal for women inside<br>surprise and her she built on the work<br>of others but she made this work<br>incredibly accessible and what she<br>thought was let's not just think about<br>one treatment versus another because the<br>reality is it's not prozac versus<br>placebo for depression there's a whole<br>bunch of other treatments that might be<br>of use to us that we might want to know<br>about the she did some incredibly clever<br>statistical modeling to try and build<br>our understanding comparing all of those<br>treatments with each other so the red<br>line shows two treatments for which<br>there is no existing trial but we can<br>look at we can compare those treatment<br>to treatment statistically and the<br>wonderful thing about Georgia was she<br>wrote all the statistical coding she put<br>it out on her University website for<br>everyone to use I think there was many a<br>night when I probably put a semicolon in<br>the wrong place and couldn't get it to<br>work and she would patiently just<br>explain to me what I've done wrong with<br>my coding but without Georgia I wouldn't<br>have been able to do some of the other<br>things that I've done so we looked at<br>what can be done to prevent<br>complications of kidney disease and<br>diabetes because the network approach<br>allowed us to answer even bigger<br>questions and so we have a terrible<br>problem in our region with diabetes so<br>in the western Pacific we have a hundred<br>and thirty one million people who are<br>affected by diabetes and growing in a<br>New Zealand of all the Maori and Pacific<br>patients who start dialysis seventy-five<br>percent of them it's because of diabetes<br>so it's something we need to work very<br>hard at so we asked the question the<br>any evidence that lowering blood<br>pressure helps to prevent complications<br>blood pressure must be good right so we<br>got a paper and Lancet and we this is a<br>network that we built and I want to show<br>you Demetrius medidas who took over from<br>Georgia for answering my email spam I<br>spend him to try and get the coding<br>right and Anna Kimani who was incredibly<br>helpful at making all of her code every<br>time she thought up a new code they<br>would send it to me so I couldn't have<br>done this without them and what we<br>showed was we found a hundred and fifty<br>seven studies involving 43,000 people<br>and the reason this was in Lance that<br>was because even blood pressure lowering<br>treatment for diabetes and kidney<br>disease we didn't find any evidence that<br>that treatment helped to improve<br>survival which was a pretty sobering<br>fact we then looked at glucose lowering<br>medicines and we broaden the scope to<br>anyone with diabetes the reason this was<br>important was because this is where<br>diabetes is most common the USA Southern<br>America actually Australia New Zealand<br>in parts of Europe but the hard I be<br>teas is concentrated and low and middle<br>income countries and 80% of deaths<br>annually actually happen in those<br>countries so don't happen in higher<br>income countries so we need treatments<br>that work in lower and middle-income<br>countries so we took a step back and we<br>looked at all of the glucose lowering<br>treatments and diabetes and we put what<br>we put 301 trials together my my Excel<br>program exploded at that point and what<br>we found was we found 300 trials but<br>amongst adults with type 2 diabetes<br>there was no difference between any of<br>the treatments<br>on the impact of death and what it meant<br>was cheap and cheerful medicines that we<br>use all the time just as good as the<br>brand spanking new ones that are coming<br>out because we couldn't identify a<br>difference between them and that large<br>data set and actually that has gone into<br>the World Health Organization guidelines<br>just it gives us permission to use the<br>cheap really accessible off-patent<br>medication and in fact that Asia under<br>suffix Society of Nephrology have just<br>contacted us to see if they can make a<br>guideline that works for the Asia<br>Pacific region concentrating on the<br>medicines are actually available so that<br>that's what this this fancy odd network<br>analysis can actually help us do on the<br>ground I was very very lucky when I came<br>back to meet with the Mardy indigenous<br>health team I was invited shall we say<br>to help run the clinical orientation<br>program was Professor bigoted and we've<br>done that together since 2011 and it's<br>been incredible fun along the way and<br>I've learned a lot including my peepee<br>heart and the Mari indigenous Health<br>Institute our this fine group of<br>incredibly articulate people with a<br>wealth of expertise in understanding<br>disparity and understanding how we<br>address that through both education and<br>research and I'm incredibly profoundly<br>grateful to them to having me in their<br>family and we once a year take all the<br>fourth year medical students to that I<br>so normally wear at all nuku and I cut<br>or we take them out of this we literally<br>invite them here for their first day and<br>then we take<br>to the morrow in which we teach them a<br>clinical model of working with Marty<br>patients and farno in a way that is<br>interesting exciting they get it they<br>get to practice it away from the glaring<br>eyes of patients and teachers and it's<br>an incredibly inspirational place to be<br>that's Tania Korea on the hill above our<br> telling the students about how the<br>roads around the bottom of our were<br>actually built and students don't know<br>that history and I didn't know that<br>history before I worked with them a<br>heating and what we've done is we've<br>done some research as well so we've<br>actually published clinical orientation<br>program for students and the outcome the<br>impact is not a global guideline it's<br>wonderful students working beautifully<br>well worth children that core hunger day<br>Oh totally inteiro toward the end of<br>their training so this program works and<br>I've learned a lot along the way but<br>what it's also done has given me an<br>understanding of how we all need to work<br>to think about iniquity in our treatment<br>practices and we know that mario pacific<br>patients start dialysis three or four or<br>five or six times more often than New<br>Zealand European patients and the access<br>token the transplantation they don't<br>know the reasons completely why but<br>access to transplantation is not as high<br>as it is for using in European patients<br>and what I've been lucky to do is to<br>actually work with Tanya hoodia so<br>Tanya's doing a PhD with me Suzanne<br>pitama<br>and lots and working looking at iniquity<br>and diocese practices around New Zealand<br>she's done some wonderful work and she's<br>shown that there are disparities even<br>accounting for socioeconomic<br>factors and that her she charges us at<br>the end of her first paper by saying<br>disparity and treatments and outcomes<br>for New Zealand patients should be<br>monitored and addressed we need to keep<br>measuring them we need to keep talking<br>about them<br>and we need to keep doing the work to<br>understand them and I don't think we do<br>in kidney disease fully understand them<br>yet and I've also worked with associate<br>professor Rachel Walker who's New<br>Zealand's first New Zealand nephrology<br>practitioner and she's done some<br>wonderful work up in the Hawke's Bay<br>actually talking with Maori patients on<br>dialysis and hearing their hearing their<br>stories so that we can understand them<br>more deeply so that's all great we we<br>kind of got to a point where we don't<br>know whether many of our treatments have<br>a good evidence base so how can we<br>respond to this we need to do something<br>we can't just keep measuring it so the<br>big challenge that we vertical recently<br>is how do we make kidney trials easier<br>so there is a problem and we did this<br>really interesting this is one of my<br>favorite papers actually this is<br>Michaela Shane Kelly poly who works with<br>Giovanni in in our Italian group and she<br>basically went to PubMed and she counted<br>up the trials and she looked at them by<br>specialty and she understood how many<br>trials each specialty did and the green<br>line along the bottom with the little<br>boxes on it is trials and kidney disease<br>we get the wooden spoon for the number<br>of trials we actually do and that must<br>be a system a system based problem you<br>know they're they're hard to do but when<br>we we don't have structures we haven't<br>built our research structures to support<br>trials as much as other specialties have<br>ahead of us and we're learning from<br>other specialties and our trials are<br>pretty small on average about a third of<br>our trials have between 11 and 50 people<br>in them and only how<br>Charles actually get the full number of<br>people that we need in them to<br>understand the effect of treatment to<br>change policy in healthcare and the<br>other big problem is that we have<br>research over there<br>in academic institutions or in clinical<br>research clinical spaces then we have<br>the activity of the hospital over the<br>year and it takes quite a lot of energy<br>and effort from lots of people to bring<br>those two things together so we notice<br>this fantastic piece in the New England<br>Journal called the randomized registry<br>trial the next disruptive technology I<br>love disruptive technology and clinical<br>research and we've got this wonderful<br>group of people and in Brisbane based in<br>Brisbane but it's all of us around<br>Australia and New Zealand called the<br>Australasian kidney trials Network and<br>they work really really hard and trying<br>to make trials a lot easier and they've<br>done a fantastic job and we thought hey<br>why don't we doing registry trials and<br>kidney disease so I'll just briefly show<br>you what a registry trial is so this is<br>two cardiologists nephrologist don't<br>dress up like this very often so this is<br>two fabulous cardiologists doing you<br>know some procedure and the lab and<br>basically a registry trial would be<br>these two identifying that the patient<br>is needing of the seizure that we want<br>to evaluate so whatever it is they're<br>about to do they're not sure whether<br>that's going to be in the pace whether<br>that's going to be an effective<br>treatment so they can consent that<br>patient literally just before the trials<br>about the start so out in the waiting<br>room just right in the clinical space by<br>the clinical practitioner they've<br>consented the patient using the normal<br>hospital system they've gone on to the<br>you know the hospital clinical console<br>and used that system to consent a<br>patient rather than having to find forms<br>and photocopying things and giving<br>someone an early to deal with it and<br>then all of the important follow-up that<br>their patients going to get is done<br>automated<br>somewhere else in a registry so that<br>patient never has to come back and find<br>parking at the hospital that clinician<br>never has to put on his or her diary<br>that they need to see someone at 3<br>o'clock in the afternoon for a clinical<br>follow-up it's just sit and forget and<br>it means that trials are much much more<br>efficient we can answer questions with a<br>kind of much more real life and it<br>randomizes how we actually practice so<br>it's kind of randomized care not random<br>care does it work does this approach<br>work well there's this amazing trial in<br>the New England Journal that that<br>editorial was about where they were<br>looking at just patients and they're in<br>the cath lab for coronary artery<br>interventions and they randomized 7,000<br>people than 36 months and it cost per<br>patient in the trial 50 extra dollars in<br>addition to normal kids it's just<br>fantastic<br>so we thought hey why don't we try and<br>do this in Australia and New Zealand and<br>we've got one going so this is the best<br>fluids trial so we have a wonderful<br>increase in kidney transplantation in<br>New Zealand so since 2013 the proportion<br>of kidney transplants where you have<br>it's just a success story and a lot of<br>it is down to intensive care colleagues<br>who have really changed the way they<br>practice in order to allow families to<br>let their deceased loved ones donate a<br>kidney or heart it's just it's just a<br>tremendous thing but about a quarter of<br>people who receive a kidney from a<br>deceased donor and Kenny doesn't work<br>straightaway can be a bit sleepy they<br>need a bit of dialysis and that can lead<br>to complications prolonged hospital stay<br>anxiety and we wondered and I'll show<br>you in a minute<br>how this came about we wondered whether<br>a different weather different fluids<br>because patients get a huge<br>fluid in the first 24 hours we're trying<br>to flood that goodly to make sure it<br>absolutely works and we wondered whether<br>different fluids might make a difference<br>and there was a wonderful trial in the<br>ICU setting looking at different fluids<br>and this trial arose out of that idea<br>and we also have now this looks a little<br>bit boring and believe me when we have<br>to fill these forms out once a year on<br>all of our dances patients and<br>transplant patients we think it's a<br>little bit tiresome as well but this is<br>the N style registry and every patient<br>adult and child in New Zealand who has<br>Dallas's or transplant is in this<br>registry and this registries at Ulmer<br>it's been going since 1970 it's just<br>fantastic and this gives us the<br>opportunity to do that that automated<br>follow up so patients don't need to come<br>back so what's happened while Michael<br>Collins has been the force behind this<br>child he's a nephrologist and Auckland<br>all of the New Zealand transplant our<br>community of come on board and you might<br>see the wiggle this is our anticipated<br>recruitment and normally trials kind of<br>start off and then forth but this trial<br>has just done astoundingly well and in<br>fact Michael has changed the end point<br>because we're anticipating far more<br>patients will it be able to be in the<br>child in anticipated so it's turned our<br>trial sessions on their head very<br>briefly I'm almost done what is the<br>future hold so my future I'd really<br>really like to continue this focus on<br>equity understanding how we can deliver<br>the amazing care that we have to more<br>people and to do this I'm lucky enough<br>to be working with Tanya hoodia with HR<br>says she's going to be exploring equity<br>and kidney transplantation working with<br>doctors Walker Rachel and Curtis looking<br>at patient experiences of<br>transplantation funded by lotteries and<br>we're working through with the Ministry<br>of House<br>creating national practice guidelines<br>for the management of kidney disease the<br>next generation is what I'm really keen<br>to focus on so we've got some wonderful<br>young woman who are doing fantastic<br>kidney work fantastic research they've<br>got more energy than I do<br>and I hope that I can contribute to<br>their future lives for a wee while<br>longer and we want to do more trials so<br>the phosphate trial which is the<br>Australia Australian kidney trials<br>Network is really looking at whether<br>phosphate will actually phosphate<br>binders will actually make a difference<br>and we're also looking at a trial to see<br>whether teaching people to do their<br>personal dances and a more systematic<br>way might help avoid serious infections<br>and improve well-being so just to<br>finalize I fundamental to this was the<br>Rutherford fellowship which gave me a<br>huge amount of my time and so I was<br>allowed to buy out my some of my<br>teaching time although I still enjoyed<br>teaching all the way through but it gave<br>you five years of serious ability to<br>knuckle down because as you know<br>research takes that uninterrupted time<br>to get to that deep dive that next level<br>of thinking and the Loreal fallen and<br>science prize a they gave me a fabulous<br>photo which is the one at the top they<br>also connected me with school girls and<br>we had some wonderful time at the<br>University of Auckland with school girls<br>and it's amazing the questions they ask<br>it's fantastic<br>they put nests and science were for<br>nerds but they<br>they were they were absolutely great and<br>also the Loreal prize gave me money to<br>do whatever I wanted with so they gave<br>it to women they said you could you<br>could organize some childcare with it<br>you can you know do what you need to do<br>to support your research which I just<br>think is fantastic so finally thank you<br>to everyone who's been along this<br>journey many of you out in this room so<br>family colleagues students who teach me<br>so much patience who teach me an<br>incredible amount collaborators funders<br>not least of watch friends and most of<br>all to Andrew for supporting me and<br>absolutely everything thank you<br>akira tena koe toto tena koe tena koe to<br>account or Co Paul Brunton at home my<br>name is Paul Brunton and I have the<br>privilege to be the pro vice-chancellor<br>for Health Sciences at the University of<br>a target one of the highlights of my<br>role is I get to come to a lot of these<br>and I think they're wonderful occasions<br>and tonight was no exception<br>I thought we heard today of a journey of<br>personal development in research if I<br>may say so beautifully told absolutely<br>beautifully told by an individual who's<br>clearly very passionate about what she<br>does we also heard about meta-analyses<br>and systematic reviews and Cochrane and<br>on a personal note in a former life I<br>used to be an editor for Cochrane so I<br>know how many hours go into these things<br>and how much work goes into a systematic<br>review international office more<br>importantly I think we heard a lot about<br>what I call research in action some of<br>my colleagues would call it<br>translational research but it's about<br>research making a difference to patients<br>about guidelines about clinical practice<br>changing on the back of robust evidence<br>and research and you've clearly been<br>very very successful in that so it's my<br>role to thank professor Palmer on our<br>behalf for what I thought was a<br>wonderful lecture and if we could all<br>now then professor Murdoch did mention<br>two medals that are going to be awarded<br>this year I've actually discovered<br>something that's where Tony is not very<br>good at and that is receiving the<br>Middle's that you gets awarded and so<br>tonight we're actually going to rectify<br>that situation so tonight we're actually<br>going to award two medals that she's<br>been awarded over the past few years in<br>fact when we were setting up this event<br>its wear tennis mmm mum says and what<br>about the Cal Smith middle and I don't<br>know didn't you get there three years<br>ago and apparently not so I think what<br>happened there were two will they two<br>Palmer's that year that's right there is<br>tagged 2015 there were two awardees<br>office this middle both had the surname<br>Palmer and I think there was some reason<br>why yours was deferred and somehow it<br>got lost in the system so I contacted<br>Richard Blake who did you Vice<br>Chancellor search who was very<br>apologetic when he hunted around and<br>managed to find the middle very<br>apologetic he couldn't come here today<br>but at least we've managed this so this<br>is the the ROE Heath trust award and<br>carlsmith middle that was irk Cal Smith<br>was the prominent Dunedin businessman<br>used to be on the University Council and<br>he set up the Rohith trust the support<br>the university's work aimed to promote<br>research at the University and this<br>award was given in recognition of<br>outstanding research to early career<br>staff and in fact he is quite a<br>character because in fact as well as the<br>middle you get a book I might get Holly<br>in who Helen you I'll get get you to get<br>into a water but maybe we can hold up<br>the I'll get you out here now we can<br>hold up the book so people can see this<br>is and you can see it's a little it's<br>not new in fact I think the<br>I think right the university hunts<br>around second-hand books book shops to<br>get this award give this up this book<br>written by Carl Smith and quote it's a<br>witty and penetrating observations that<br>delighted New Zealanders for years and<br>as Richard Blakey put in brackets after<br>with possibly post-war generationally at<br>least in any case published in 1947 and<br>part of the receiving us you actually<br>have to read it okay so I can get as<br>part of your yeah well so with great<br>pleasure we get to finally after three<br>years awards you with them with the<br>carlsmith middle end of book and while<br>your veer earlier this year where Tony<br>was a recipient of one of university of<br>otago Christchurch's gold medals for<br>research excellence and about a few days<br>before the actual welcome of him where<br>we award these the person who engraves<br>the medals was admitted to hospital and<br>he was actually very sick and he was in<br>the hospital for several weeks together<br>but anyway at the last minute we were<br>unable although he did give you a little<br>bit of paper yes we did at the last<br>minute we actually it was only more<br>recently we received the gold meal so<br>thank you so ladies and gentlemen that<br>concludes the formal part of the evening<br>and it's my pleasure to invite you all<br>to come and join us for some<br>refreshments outside and we can chat<br>about the evening thank you very much<br>indeed thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
