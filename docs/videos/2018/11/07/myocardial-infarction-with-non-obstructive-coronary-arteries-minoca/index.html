Shawn coffee and you can see the<br>title they're both going to speak today<br>and then there'll be time for questions<br>at the end now we are we do have people<br>online watching this presentation so if<br>we do have questions from you at the end<br>we will have to ask you to speak into<br>the microphone so we can make sure all<br>of the people online can actually hear<br>what's being asked in the response so<br>thank you very much so today we're going<br>to talk about myocardial infraction and<br>traditionally our understanding of a<br>presentation is that usually there will<br>be an underlying F sclerotic plaque<br>rupture evidence from us in so as<br>clinical cardiologists we go to the cath<br>lab and do an angiogram we would expect<br>to see some sort of residual stenosis<br>about 10% of the time and a person who's<br>apparently having a myocardial<br>infarction with clinical symptoms ECG<br>changes we see nothing<br>and often it's been underappreciated<br>that this could be the real thing and<br>clinicians of team to think maybe it<br>isn't a myocardial infraction we'll<br>discuss some of the other diagnoses and<br>that it could be and there's a danger<br>and by not understanding that it is a<br>myocardial infraction that we might<br>under treat these patients with<br>evidence-based treatments and so the aim<br>of our presentation today is to<br>underline the importance of this<br>presentation to give a series of case<br>histories where persons present with<br>mimics of myocardial infarction then<br>we're going to focus in on the entity<br>itself and use some of their research<br>findings to look at presentation and<br>outcome of persons<br>with myocardial infarction without<br>obstructive coronary so we're going to<br>start with this woman in 68 year old who<br>was visiting her son and family in a<br>rural area of Otago and a traumatic<br>event occurred and she had a cardiac<br>arrest in front of the family and they<br>immediately started resuscitation and<br>called for an ambulance which was going<br>to be some time away<br>up until the stage there was no hint of<br>any problems with ischemic heart disease<br>as you can see she'd hit a past history<br>a couple of years ago treatment for a<br>b-cell lymphoma it had chemotherapy and<br>radiotherapy was a good result there<br>were some pulmonary nodules of uncertain<br>significance which has been in<br>investigated in biopsy found to be<br>necrotizing granuloma - there was no<br>evidence of residual lymphoma so she was<br>essentially cured and she'd gone forward<br>and had a successful right ankle<br>replacement in 2017 and she had a<br>peripheral neuropathy is as queerly of<br>her chemotherapy so this is the<br>presentation rhythm willness and John<br>Ambulance arrived and I think there was<br>at least a 15 or 20-minute delays so<br>there was a sustained period of<br>resuscitation by family members and you<br>can see that she was in ventricular<br>fibrillation and after the first shock<br>returned back to sinus rhythm in about<br>three minutes later she had recurrent<br>ventricular fibrillation and was<br>successfully shocked again and then<br>maintained sinus rhythm so the time near<br>was at about 1953 and she was<br>transported to Dunedin Hospital where<br>the first ECG was performed about 1036<br>and it's pretty unremarkable there are<br>no marked distal segment changes and<br>it's relatively straightforward we know<br>what to do if someone's got st elevation<br>it's than<br>you go to the cafeteria here it's a<br>little bit more uncertain she'd had a<br>return of spontaneous circulation post<br>cardiac arrest and thinking it through<br>with a presentation with some tricky<br>defibrillation there was a pretty<br>significant probability of a cardiac<br>cause so if we look at the guidelines<br>what to do in this situation was a<br>presumed acute coronary syndrome as I<br>intimated before is the elevations<br>straightforward and there's a<br>recommendation it's relatively limited<br>evidence that you should take these<br>people to the cath lab because and a<br>significant majority with St elevation<br>you'll find a legion however if you've<br>got no ST elevation and no prior<br>clinical features and currently ischemia<br>is considered the likely cause on<br>clinical grounds which was the case here<br>with no evidence at all in a weak<br>recommendation you could consider<br>coronary angiography which was what was<br>done in this situation so the first city<br>shows the right coronary artery in an LA<br>ou projection and it's completely free<br>of significant disease and on the your<br>right panel an RA o of the right<br>coronary artery and which is also free<br>of disease then we took views of the<br>left coronary system and I've just put<br>two representative views up but<br>basically there's no significant<br>obstructive current is ease so her<br>progress thereafter was that she went<br>through the intensive care unit and she<br>was still intubated and ventilated at<br>their time and maintained sinus rhythm<br>there was no show theory with me a<br>reason blood pressures and following<br>warning didn't require any vaso pressure<br>support woken up extubated<br>neurologically intact and apparently are<br>very good initial recovery so she was<br>able to be transferred up to the<br>coronary care unit and here are the<br>serial troponin levels<br>you can see that by 0:30 hours and it's<br>some three to four hours after a cardiac<br>arrest there was a fairly significant<br>increase in the hiset stewey troponin t<br>and then it fell so an enzyme pattern of<br>a probable myocardial infarction not<br>much in the way the ECG changes and no<br>obstructive coronary disease what's<br>going on and I'll turn over to Sean<br>coffee to answer that question all right<br>thank you Michael so we're now in the<br>situation where we've had someone who's<br>had a very significant cardiac event<br>without any obvious cause and so it it<br>makes us ask a few questions first of<br>all has she had a heart attack because<br>that's the most obvious thing that's<br>what we were looking for when she was<br>sent to the cath lab but the arteries<br>were clear on the angiogram so if it's<br>not a heart attack then what is it and<br>of course at this point we don't have<br>any further information to point us one<br>direction or another but actually we<br>start to get a little bit philosophical<br>at this stage and we'd say well what<br>even is a heart attack you know and once<br>you start going down that road you start<br>getting a bit more existential you say<br>do I care should I even care right and<br>and but those are important things<br>because maybe this is just something<br>that we we end up seeing that is no<br>implication longer-term if the corners<br>are clean and there are those last two<br>questions the caring part I'm going to<br>leave to dr. Williams to answer later on<br>and I will focus on the other bits and<br>we'll go at it in reverse order so what<br>what is a heart attack luckily there are<br>people out there people who do a lot of<br>research you need a lot of citations who<br>define these things<br>and they defined them at based really<br>around and this is really coming to play<br>since cardiac biomarkers started to come<br>on the scene the more sensitive these<br>have become the more we're starting to<br>diagnose things for the troponin and a<br>marker cardiac injury goes up without<br>them possibly having what we would have<br>previously called a heart attack so this<br>if you think of that blue squares<br>everybody who presents with a possible<br>acute coronary syndrome all of these<br>there will be people whose whose<br>troponin remains totally normal and you<br>know data they definitely haven't had a<br>heart attack but in here in that middle<br>in this circular section around here<br>these are people where the troponin has<br>gone off and so the troponin has gone up<br>and you know because of that that<br>they've had a myocardial injury of some<br>description you can't say any more than<br>that at that point but a myocardial<br>infarction<br>is a subset of that group there are<br>people were you've evidence of an injury<br>or you have a dynamic troponin so<br>there's been a rise and fall but you've<br>also got something to point in<br>myocardial ischemia or lack of<br>sufficient oxygen to the myocardium and<br>so that could be in the form of for<br>instance ST elevation on the ECG it<br>could be in the form of new wall motion<br>abnormalities on cardiac imaging or it<br>could be just in the form that they're<br>getting classical ischemic chest pain<br>and if you look at these little things<br>here the potential causes so if we take<br>anemia for an example if you have<br>someone who's anemic they may suffer no<br>adverse consequences of that but the<br>more anemic they become and the more<br>compromised they become even if their<br>arteries are perfectly clear they will<br>move into that area where you have first<br>myocardial injury and then a form of<br>myocardial infarction without there been<br>any problem with the<br>trees at all just purely due to lack of<br>myocardial oxygen delivery so we if we<br>take that subset that's that group where<br>you I've got a confirm myocardial<br>infarction what we now divided into is<br>two major types there are other subtypes<br>but they tend to be kind of procedural<br>related but the two major types we think<br>about now a type one myocardial<br>infarction and type 2 and so a type 1<br>myocardial infarction is bought used<br>everyone used to call a heart attack<br>it's what the general public thinks of a<br>heart attack<br>we have an authoress carotid plaque that<br>has had some kind of rupture erosion you<br>get a sudden acute blockage with with<br>the standard platelet aggregation and<br>this is what and he played four<br>therapies in the form of aspirin treat<br>in a form of clopidogrel to calcula and<br>all those other things like the heparins<br>that we use to try and break down that<br>clot and restore perfusion to that to<br>the arteries well what we've<br>increasingly recognized with high<br>sensitivity troponin is that it's it's<br>it's perfectly not common but it's it's<br>something that we see not infrequently<br>that you would have a myocardial<br>infarction out there being any type of<br>what used to be called an acute MI or<br>now we call it type 1 MI and these are<br>things where you've got a fixed amount<br>so a fix out there is grow extra notice<br>that at rest may not be causing any<br>trouble but for some other reason for<br>instance they become hypotensive in the<br>setting of sepsis they're just not<br>getting enough myocardial oxygen and so<br>you can see these on the right-hand side<br>here so we've got things like the<br>vasospasm like coronary artery<br>dissection or you can have a completely<br>clear set of coronary arteries and it's<br>purely down to that mismatch between<br>what's being provided and what has been<br>asked for from the ox<br>on review now so if we go on to the next<br>the first question we had there is has<br>she had a heart attack now we have this<br>kind of flow chart where we can work our<br>way through and so we think about so has<br>she had an elevated cardiac troponin yes<br>she has has she had a rise or fall over<br>here and yes yes she has at that and so<br>at this point we're saying hi she added<br>acute ischemia or hasn't she and that<br>will send you down different pathways<br>Oliver and the reality is that this is<br>not how patients present and this is<br>something that you can work through in<br>retrospect but actually doesn't really<br>help you a lot at the time and so the<br>real world what we see is someone<br>presents usually to the emergency<br>department with some kind of a<br>presentation that's consistent would<br>ischemia and that's usually something<br>like chest pain but in the case of our<br>patient bill is with ventricular<br>fibrillation<br>without an other obvious source but for<br>whatever reason they have a presentation<br>that's consistent with myocardial<br>ischemia and then they go on to have an<br>ECG and this is usually done to look for<br>ST elevation and if they've got<br>something acute on there they'll be sent<br>to the cath lab or it may be there's<br>nothing particular on the ECG but you do<br>a troponin and a few hours later that<br>comes up as showing a myocardial injury<br>of some description and at that point<br>then you go do an angiogram and so then<br>you do an angiogram and then that can be<br>broken down very roughly into either<br>obstructive coronary artery disease are<br>non-obstructive and the definition of<br>obstructive disease varies a little bit<br>but in general it's it's what we're<br>looking for is any kind of lesion that<br>would obstruct the flow and the arteries<br>and that's usually taken as 50 to 70%<br>stenosis on an angiogram although there<br>are other ways to assess that but if we<br>and those are the ones that are easy you<br>have you do the angiogram there's a<br>stenosis and you treat that and then<br>everyone is<br>okay but if we think about the patient<br>we have four would actually have got<br>nothing to point to on the angiogram<br>we've got this non-obstructive picture<br>on the angiogram and that has been given<br>the label troponin positive chest pain<br>with non-obstructive crummy arteries or<br>tip Milka which really is never going to<br>catch on because there's not enough<br>follows they're just not enough and so<br>but that's that's what this lady had at<br>this point in time and when we look at<br>these sort of of patients so we're in<br>this situation when we're not calling it<br>an MI yet we just don't have enough<br>information to call it that but they've<br>got a presentation with troponin<br>positive they've got some kind of leak<br>and everything in cardiology is called<br>chest pain no matter what it is but<br>they've had some kind of presentation<br>consistently non-obstructive coronaries<br>and then you get into what are the<br>causes of that and things like the extra<br>cardiac causes or or tend to be a little<br>bit more obvious or something septic<br>though they'll usually have something to<br>point to there and so we're left with<br>water dividing into the major cardiac<br>causes much usually things like non<br>ischemic and ischemic causes and so the<br>ischemic ones are them<br>myocardial infarction on obstructive<br>coronary and those it may be that you<br>have had a plaque rupture event but for<br>instance they've had thrombolysis in<br>Invercargill by the time they get here<br>the arteries are completely clear it's<br>worked perfectly well it could be<br>something like coronary vasospasm so<br>that you have had a stenosis or flow<br>limiting lesion due to the artery just<br>clamping down but by the time you get to<br>the cath lab that is relaxed and it<br>looks clear but the other major group<br>here are the the non ischemic causes and<br>those might be things like Mario Kart<br>ladies might be like yeah our other<br>cardiomyopathies and to work these out<br>we've looked at the arteries and now<br>it's time to look at the my car<br>and so if we go back to the patient that<br>Michael described this is her left<br>ventricular Grandview and so this is a<br>an injection of contrast into the left<br>ventricle and what you should see here<br>is the entire ventricle contracting what<br>you actually say hell of it is that the<br>the basal segments here are contracting<br>really well in fact if anything that<br>they're probably contracting more than<br>you would normally see but the mid-and<br>apical segments are not moving at all<br>and so this is a very very<br>characteristic presentation here and<br>this is called takasugi syndrome or<br>stress cardiomyopathy and what a<br>attacker symbol is just a translation of<br>an octopus part and this is what an<br>octopus cloth looks like you've got this<br>narrow waist here for the the octopus<br>goes in and this is the mouth here goes<br>in here and gets trapped here because<br>it's got that not always and that's<br>exactly what the ventricle looks like in<br>the vast majority of cases of Technica<br>suit syndrome so free and so that's and<br>that's that's what our patient and in<br>this this is this is a condition that if<br>if the patient survived the initial<br>period of time they usually have an<br>excellent prognosis around about maybe<br>five possibly up to 10% of people died<br>in that initial phase but if they can<br>survive that they will usually recover<br>the vast majority of the cardiac<br>function but in around six to eight<br>weeks and so if we look at if we take it<br>in general if we look at people who've<br>troponin positive non-obstructive<br>coronaries and you look at the different<br>potentials here then acute myocardial<br>infarction counts around about a poetry<br>of these patients myocarditis comes per<br>on the third and then the other<br>cardiomyopathy is like Takasugi or a<br>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy counts for<br>small number and and right at the bottom<br>there you find the ones we just don't<br>get an answer for and that's probably<br>just because our<br>techniques are just not good enough<br>furniture at this point in time so if we<br>just got through a few of those other<br>presentations so myocarditis is just<br>inflammation of the myocardium this is a<br>relatively young man who presented with<br>a viral prodrome but he had he had ST<br>elevation on his ECG and it's not sure<br>if that's just take down the lights here<br>a little bit you can see here there's<br>this little white patch here this is a<br>cardiac MRI this is a t2-weighted signal<br>so it's looking for myocardial edema and<br>there's a little bit of increased signal<br>in this area and this is the lake got a<br>lynnium picture here and you can see<br>these little white fox just on the<br>outside of the myocardium and that is<br>absolutely characteristic for<br>myocarditis and in most cases this will<br>be down to having had a viral infection<br>here's another lady that presented<br>earlier this year so 64 year old woman<br>she had a little bit of mild<br>hypertension but really not not no<br>significant risk factors and had been<br>getting increasingly out of breath with<br>three months and a two weeks of chest<br>pain which was relatively exertional<br>and this is a very common way for<br>myocardial ischemia to present she had<br>an ECG that looked like this and I think<br>I'm fairly safe to say here but for edie<br>people in a toggle and sulfon this is<br>this is your ticket to cardiology<br>because you've got a biphasic t wife<br>here which really is is is viewed as a<br>possible proximal el-ad lesion or well<br>ensign and the ECG which which it does<br>turn out to be on occasion but anyway<br>this is what gets you into cardiology<br>they had a troponin which was just at<br>the upper limit of normal and this is<br>often so to work out if there's a rise<br>and fall of course you need additional<br>numbers but this is how people present<br>at a single point in time she had an<br>echocardiogram that looked a little bit<br>like this and so if we<br>look on here this is the left ventricle<br>in here and the right ventricle just<br>above it and what you can see there is<br>that the the ventricle itself is a<br>little bit brighter than you would<br>normally expect it's a little bit<br>thicker but it's not overly easy to see<br>all right<br>and it could be down to that<br>hypertension possibly being a little bit<br>worse than we've previously told so she<br>went on to have an MRI and here we go<br>and so here's our MRI and you can see<br>here that there's the septum they are<br>really much thicker here compared to<br>further down here much thicker then<br>becomes corresponding part of the heart<br>and the other side and that's absolutely<br>typical for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy<br>an inherited cardiac condition this is<br>the leg got a lynnium imaging on the MRI<br>and this looks at myocardial scarified<br>Roces and you can see this bright patch<br>right at that thickest area of the<br>myocardium and here it is in<br>cross-section in here and further down<br>here and this again is fairly typical<br>for myocardial infarction you get a the<br>muscle will increase in size the color<br>the Maya sites become disorganized and<br>you got a college and laying down into<br>the muscle itself giving a myocardial<br>injury giving that appearance on the ECG<br>and this lady what I didn't show was<br>that she had non-obstructive core knees<br>at the time if we're in patient strain<br>and one last case presentation here so<br>this is a 69 year old woman smart zero<br>and what that is a standard modifiable<br>risk factors and so that's things like<br>smoking hypertension<br>hypercholesterolemia basically no<br>significant cardiac risk factors<br>possibly other than her age which isn't<br>particularly modifiable and so she had a<br>atypical chest pain and as is common in<br>in parts of the targa and Southland<br>completely ignored that for many weeks<br>before someone center and to achieve<br>and she ended up in cardiology training<br>but you're outside that window where a<br>troponin will pick up any acute injury<br>or ECG or echo was normal<br>ECG showed a few kind of nonspecific<br>changes on the on the anterior leads so<br>you know maybe something is going on but<br>you don't know what the echo looked fine<br>and so when she went on to have have a<br>cardiac MRI actually there's a very<br>localized area here this is the heart<br>and cross section or the pump function<br>overall is good which is what you'll see<br>an echo but this part here probably<br>isn't contracting as well as it should<br>be and then on the lake garda lynnium<br>images or looking for that myocardial<br>scar you see a nice rim of scar tissue<br>in the sub and the car diem and that is<br>absolutely classic for a heart attack so<br>this person has had a myocardial<br>infarction almost certainly at the time<br>before her chest pain presentation and<br>so what I've just covered there is what<br>you know what it is if how you how you<br>define a heart attack all you say it is<br>a heart attack and if it's not a heart<br>attack how you say what it isn't and<br>that involves look at the myocardium and<br>I'm just going to hand back to Michael<br>now to go on to that about why<br>should we care about these myocardial<br>which would we care well of course which<br>here as expert technicians physicians we<br>care for and about our patients and<br>their outcome but as I alluded to in the<br>introduction to this presentation if<br>you're uncertain about what's going on<br>then is difficult to know should we<br>apply the normal paradigm that we<br>normally would use after someone's<br>unequivocally had a myocardial<br>infraction we're going to use double<br>antiplatelet agents we're going to use<br>an ACE inhibitor we're going to use a<br>statin and in a group of persons we may<br>consider a beta blocker and generally<br>that's restricted now to those who have<br>heart failure or asymptomatic and<br>payment of different regular function<br>and I won't be able to answer the<br>question on what is the appropriate<br>treatment for myocardial infarction with<br>non obstructive coronary artery disease<br>because it remains unknown but we've<br>conducted some research to try and get<br>an idea of the presentation and the<br>outcome for this person because if a<br>person comes in is presumed there was a<br>chest pain syndrome<br>st elevation may be there or not but<br>troponin rise eric has a coronary<br>angiogram and the collisions and doubt<br>will let influence the way their game to<br>treat that patient we don't have the<br>resources to do in our cardiac Kumar and<br>all patients okay so we've presented<br>some lovely cases to give you an idea of<br>how in a perfect world you might<br>investigate such persons but generally<br>that's just lived to judgment and we<br>hoped that this research which was<br>recently published in heart online would<br>give clinicians some useful background<br>on outcomes for people presenting<br>so the maybe a perception not really<br>based on evidence that these people<br>might be of lower risk than someone with<br>obstructive currently disease in<br>myocardial infraction and that's because<br>there's a deeply held conviction certain<br>amongst cardiologists that your risk and<br>it's proven certainly in chronic<br>coronary artery disease the future of<br>vents in mortality is related to the<br>severity of obstruction of the coronary<br>artery so if you have multi vessel<br>disease you'll have a worse outcome over<br>time than a person with single vessel<br>disease and so there's a tendency<br>amongst collisions to think well you<br>know if you haven't got a currently<br>obstruction maybe things are not going<br>to be too bad in the future so previous<br>studies and they're largely<br>observational as is this research I'll<br>present today suggest the fairly large<br>range of subsequent myocardial<br>infraction with death rates anywhere<br>from as low as two percent up to nine<br>point one percent at two years and to<br>give you an idea<br>those with obstructive currently disease<br>will have a mortality of about ten<br>percent at one dear now the background<br>to the study is that because we don't<br>know whether obstructive coronary artery<br>disease has higher rates of adverse<br>events and compared to those without non<br>obstructive disease we wanted to answer<br>that question and we were going to<br>determine the rates of adverse cardiac<br>events in a national consecutive series<br>of subjects post myocardial infraction<br>and we wanted to compare events and<br>patients post myocardial infarction<br>stratified by obstructive disease and<br>for the purposes of the study that was<br>persons who had a coronary angiogram if<br>they have any of this or with a 50%<br>stenosis or greater they considered as<br>having obstructive coronary disease and<br>if you had any irregularity of the<br>coronary arteries up to a narrowing of<br>less than 50% diameter that's called<br>mild coronary disease and then those who<br>have apparently no irregularities of<br>they're classified as having normal<br>coronary artery disease in an addition<br>we wanted to<br>I compare the subsequent events after<br>presentation with myocardial infarction<br>to a large group of persons in the<br>community agent six managed who had no<br>currently actual disease so the way we<br>conducted the study is we looked at a<br>national analysis we had eight thousand<br>three hundred five patients and they all<br>had got undergone coronary angiography<br>over a period of two years as outlined<br>in the way we click this data is from<br>the air all new zealand acute coronary<br>syndrome registry and it's called ends x<br>qi so this is a registry that's been<br>running now for in its early phases<br>seven years but rolled out to every<br>hospital in new zealand over the last at<br>least three years and it's got two arms<br>the cath lab arm so anyone who has a<br>coronary angiogram in new zealand and<br>both public and private hospitals will<br>be captured in this database and<br>therefore we can be confident that we've<br>got all the people who had coronary<br>angiography and a subsection a<br>significant subsection of them would<br>have had an acute coronary syndrome and<br>then there is another arm called the<br>acute coronary syndrome and that will<br>capture people who are admitted to a<br>cardiology unit and some a small<br>proportion of those usually due to other<br>comorbidities or excessive risk will not<br>have a coronary angiogram at the moment<br>and the capture isn't 100% because it<br>doesn't include persons admitted to<br>general medical services with acute<br>coronary syndrome so we defined<br>myocardial infarction according to the<br>2012 third universal different<br>definition it's just been superseded by<br>the fourth definition and published this<br>year in the European Heart Journal and<br>the aim is try and exclude noron acute<br>coronary syndrome conditions such as<br>stress cardiomyopathy it's similar to<br>the woman who we presented there's a<br>first case that she would not fit into<br>the growth<br>the cute myocardial faction was<br>non-obstructive currently disease<br>because she has another pathology as<br>best we're able to will exclude my<br>persons with myocarditis but it's almost<br>certain that some persons do creep into<br>this registry because we don't have the<br>facility to in our and everyone and we<br>testified them as i described earlier<br>and to those who had obstructive<br>coronary disease and without obstructive<br>coronary disease and then some<br>specification and to those was<br>completely normal coronary arteries and<br>those who had mild coronary artery<br>disease<br>now our next cohort is a group of<br>persons who were recruited from the<br>community and they're in a study called<br>the predictor study and currently that's<br>enrolled for about four hundred and<br>eighty thousand New Zealanders based<br>University of Auckland and this fairly<br>comprehensive descriptors of the<br>cardiovascular respect is available and<br>so we were able to age and six match<br>8305 over the click today who are<br>enrolled in the productive study over<br>that time and as an addition to the<br>cardiovascular disease risk factors<br>which are collected in primary care we<br>also have access to national databases<br>to get any missing values blood<br>parameters such as lipids glucose etc so<br>briefly we looked at survival analysis<br>using captain Meyer study and I will<br>present that and make comparisons<br>between the outcomes for those of<br>obstructive coronary disease and those<br>with mild none and then the group who'd<br>had no prior cardiovascular disease okay<br>so these tables are busy and large so<br>I'll guide you through them and<br>basically what we've got is in this<br>column here which will remains the same<br>through subsequent slides<br>we've got persons who presented with<br>myocardial infarction<br>with obstructive coronary artery disease<br>defined as a greater than 50% stenosis<br>and then there are the cohort without<br>obstructive coronary disease so<br>immediately you can see that there's<br>about seven thousand four hundred and<br>eight versus eight hundred ninety seven<br>and then we break down this group of<br>eight nine seven and to those who are<br>normal and those who are mild and I just<br>gained their highlight with this red box<br>outlining some of the differences so you<br>can see that those who present without<br>obstructive coronary artery disease<br>younger than those with obstructive<br>disease and that those who have normal<br>coronary arteries are younger again than<br>those who have mild disease if we look<br>at the proportion who are women and you<br>can see that there's a higher proportion<br>of women presenting with no obstructive<br>coronary artery disease in similarly a<br>higher proportion of the group without<br>obstructive coronary artery disease and<br>women if we look and if it's Nyssa T<br>there is a difference outlined there and<br>there's a significant difference and lo<br>and the proportion who present with St<br>elevation myocardial infraction so if<br>you have obstructive coronary disease 35<br>percent of people will present with a<br>STEMI but if you don't have obstructive<br>currently disease it's relatively<br>uncommon at Timson smoking is more<br>common<br>sorry non-smoking is more common and<br>twisted without obstructive disease so<br>if we go on to the next page of patient<br>characteristics same columns as before<br>and we'll just highlight the difference<br>in diabetes so diabetes more common than<br>those with obstructive coronary disease<br>which is pretty much as expected and<br>it's much less common than those who<br>have normal coronary arteries history<br>signal deviation is much more common as<br>you might expect and those with<br>obstructive coronary artery disease and<br>what about patient management and<br>outcomes because that was one of the<br>reasons for doing this study and I'm<br>just going to highlight some of the<br>points again the layout of the columns<br>is the same so for aspirin a fairly<br>basic treatment you'll see that 97% of<br>persons with obstructive coronary<br>disease are treated with aspirin which<br>is what you would expect but if they<br>don't have obstructive coronary diseases<br>relatively major drop-off right down to<br>ninety percent so that means someone's<br>thinking about this in making decisions<br>and you could improve that some<br>clinicians believe they haven't really<br>had a myocardial infraction and<br>therefore not treating with aspirin is a<br>reasonable deduction<br>similarly there's even if you if you<br>look the difference between those<br>between normal and mild and if you've<br>got complete if you have mild coronary<br>artery disease there's about a 94%<br>chance to get aspirin but if there's no<br>nothing there at all no irregularities<br>then the rate of best food prescription<br>goes down to 82 percent<br>Julianne he platelet therapy reflects<br>the same changes seen with aspirin so if<br>you turn up with a myocardial infarction<br>and now obstructive coronary disease<br>there's only a 50% chance that you'll be<br>sent home on jeweled antiplatelet<br>therapy if we look at this quality<br>indicator which is what proportion of<br>people are discharged on a statin and<br>antiplatelet agent plus or minus ace<br>inhibitor or beta blocker it's fairly<br>good here for those with obstructive<br>coronary disease it drops down to about<br>75% and if you have normal coronary<br>arteries again you see this gradation so<br>clearly explanations are significantly<br>influenced so outcome because doesn't<br>really matter this was one of the major<br>reasons for doing the study so here are<br>the outcomes for a composite of all<br>cause mortality or a recurrent non-fatal<br>myocardial infarction and so this is our<br>control group and from the population<br>who is you might expect a fairly low<br>rate of events over time and in red here<br>was the highest rate are those who have<br>obstructive coronary artery disease in<br>interestingly if you look these two<br>curves these are the people with normal<br>coronary arteries or mild obstructive<br>coronary artery disease they're<br>superimposed so this was interesting<br>where I mean this is not new in terms of<br>previous understanding there was a<br>thought be a gradation of risk but what<br>has not been described before to our<br>knowledge is the rate of events in<br>relation to the normal population and<br>this is a large series which is<br>demonstrated pretty convincingly that in<br>those without significant disease as no<br>difference in outcome underlining the<br>point that analysis of the coronary<br>angiogram doesn't help you predict how<br>they're going to do they still have a<br>significant rate of events which I've<br>outlined here so in this table we've<br>presented the group no prior<br>cardiovascular disease and the Minooka<br>group and those are the distractor<br>currently disease and we've looked at<br>some outcomes so firstly all cause<br>mortality and you can see as you would<br>expect that there's a gradation of risk<br>now we found this very interesting if<br>you look at cardiovascular death because<br>they've had a myocardial fax and so<br>surely that should have some influence<br>we found that the Minooka group and<br>very similar and low risk of<br>cardiovascular death and substantially<br>lower than those with obstructive<br>coronary disease now if you look at non<br>cardiovascular death very similar but<br>the similarity now is between the<br>Minooka and the obstructive coronary<br>artery disease so how might you tease<br>out these observations and one<br>hypothesis is it's not to do with the<br>currently actions it might be to do with<br>an underlying condition or status that<br>predisposes you to have the myocardial<br>infarction and that there's an extra<br>baseline risk and that if in addition<br>you have obstructive coronary artery<br>disease that's associated with<br>additional risk over time and we did do<br>some preliminary analysis to look at<br>rates of cancer between the two groups<br>and there's no difference from what we<br>can obtain from available databases if<br>we look at those who have recurrent<br>non-fatal myocardial infarction the<br>Minooka group do have an increased risk<br>of recurrent non-fatal myocardial<br>infarction but it's less than those with<br>obstructive coronary disease and for<br>reasons that are not clear doesn't seem<br>to translate and to increase your risk<br>of cardiovascular death so the<br>conclusion of our study is that if you<br>present with myocardial infarction and<br>you don't have instructive coronary<br>artery disease that you're going to have<br>a risk which is about 50% of those who<br>present was obstructive disease so it's<br>not an ignition system Ain substantially<br>higher than those in the community you<br>haven't presented so just turning up<br>with a heart attack itself and it's<br>going to give you a significant future<br>risk for reasons that remain unclear<br>the nOCA patients seem to have a<br>predominant long cardiovascular cause of<br>death interestingly Minooka patients<br>with normal currently options and mild<br>obstructive coronary disease here<br>adverse event rates underlining a prep<br>status of the coronary arteries at least<br>with mild disease under 50% isn't a<br>discriminator or an influence or a<br>future events and it looks like persons<br>presenting with this type of acute<br>coronary syndrome getting lower rates of<br>ACS evidence-based treatments yeah what<br>the study cannot answer and no study can<br>answer is doesn't matter because we<br>don't know there's no randomised trials<br>of those treatments and people with non<br>non significant disease so there are<br>some observational data from a large<br>Swedish registry called the sweetheart<br>registry and it had fascinating results<br>the weaknesses that its observational<br>but they were able to do regression<br>analyses controlling for most respect us<br>and found that it didn't really matter<br>whether you were on double antiplatelet<br>therapy they didn't seem to influence<br>stretcher events<br>beautiful anchors were of no particular<br>benefit and the major things that made a<br>difference and lowering the risk of<br>future events statins and borderline<br>positive ACE inhibitors so that's the<br>interesting challenge that lies ahead of<br>us now to use this data to move forward<br>to do formal randomized studies and get<br>the information on what is the<br>appropriate treatment for the stage<br>throat just throw it like a meat ball<br>I hide its head on that's good so you<br>keep saying that you've got<br>evidence-based treatment but I mean<br>surely that's Lord I mean what pathology<br>are you treating within and appointment<br>agents yeah so it's a very good question<br>so Trudeau physiological understanding<br>is once you start looking at these<br>people<br>the intagram is no good because you<br>can't see either anything or there's a<br>mild irregularity so if you do an<br>intravascular ultrasound you will see<br>evidence of an underlying plaque and<br>you'll often find at the ultra<br>sonography level that there's been<br>plaque erosion and so this because I<br>guess people want to think coherently<br>they still have believed it would be<br>appropriate to treat with the evidence<br>base for the other admittedly for the<br>other group because this group have<br>probably been included in large trials<br>because they're a small proportion we<br>don't have reliable information about<br>them and I couldn't say to you at the<br>moment that antiplatelet therapy doesn't<br>work because there's only one study<br>observational was suggested and one<br>analysis that it doesn't it's still<br>attractive to think a significant<br>proportion of these people have had an<br>ethros from bata Kadeem there's no doubt<br>about it's just that you can't see much<br>of a residual plaque sorry Mike I was a<br>bit surprised that beta-blockers came<br>out with no value in this so could you<br>explain whether they had bundled all the<br>besa blockers together at different<br>types now there was just the the the<br>analysis was done just a by beta-blocker<br>care and you don't know why why are you<br>surprised about that well because for<br>example if you look at the takotsubo<br>syndrome yeah Fiza boxes are advocated<br>for that are you reducing that the<br>activity oxygen consumption increasing<br>dilation sorry increasing drug rotation<br>of the heart muscle so yeah I am a bit<br>surprised but on the other hand<br>there's a move those who present with<br>myocardial faction and fully<br>revascularize there's no evidence that<br>beta blockers make any difference that's<br>true drug depends on the type ones<br>exactly but the evidence for beta<br>blockers early in my Kalia faction is<br>very weak in MI yeah okay so in terms of<br>outcome we don't we just use it yeah on<br>B I would be very surprised if it<br>doesn't work in ninety percent of<br>people's obstructive coronary disease<br>and reducing hard endpoints I'd be very<br>surprised if it worked in the smaller<br>group couldn't rule it out and remains<br>open to question it's an important<br>question but looks to me as if the day<br>of the beta blocker is going and that it<br>were most much of it was historical and<br>it was in group groups of persons who<br>weren't revascularize so they got<br>strombel Isis and they went out into the<br>community first obstructive coronary<br>disease no i'm rana singing the<br>underlying so thank you Michael just a<br>combination in the question quite sup<br>take from is GP and secondly really good<br>to see the unjust UI which you've been<br>using that's a real jewel in New Zealand<br>in terms of having this really good<br>register that you can do research<br>observational studies with I guess the<br>question and God is you Margie follow-up<br>in the study to three years was it just<br>two years so are you planning on<br>continuing follow-up because you have we<br>can read it see what the five-year<br>findings are yeah that would be reason<br>you know might have the curves up to two<br>years look pretty parallel and so I<br>think what we're really interested in<br>teasing out is you know is this some<br>sort of inflammatory disorder or do they<br>develop a higher rate of cancer<br>subsequently there that would be the<br>that's the real thrust of it to try and<br>see there's a bit of a signal about non<br>cannabis can be that we don't know what<br>it is we know before they come in they<br>don't have high rates of cancer but have<br>been lovely to follow them long term and<br>say is this a market for trouble later<br>on the immune system<br>yeah just so and so you in your study<br>you your Minooka patients I think I read<br>this correctly and<br>had a higher BMI BMI over 29 controls<br>have a high BMI as well did you control<br>your we control no actually no we did<br>not control so but we can any regression<br>we yeah but we didn't they weren't<br>matched because often see you know when<br>we did the regression analyses we<br>controlled BMI yeah so the kaplan-meier<br>is unadjusted but when we did analysis<br>we control the beam we controlled<br>represent yeah which is pretty<br>reasonable in those large numbers yeah<br>you need further questions just before<br>we wind this up okay then so please join<br>with me just once more fantastic</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
