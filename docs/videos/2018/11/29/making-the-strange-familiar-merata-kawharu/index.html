visitors members<br>of the Dunedin community and members of<br>America's fan hour and supporters here<br>for this inaugural professorial lecture<br>my name is Richard Blakey I'm the deputy<br>vice-chancellor research and Enterprise<br>and it's my great privilege to be here<br>convening this activity for us tonight<br>so special welcome to too far now I'm<br>Akira here from Auckland welcome we<br>welcome people from the other place so<br>thank you and we Paul Piero and Frieda<br>and I believe that we might have a<br>former vice-chancellor Sir David and and<br>Kieran so welcome to you both it is our<br>pleasure to - to be here to host those<br>that wish to support and celebrate this<br>wonderful occasion with Meritor and her<br>family I'm going to just give you an<br>introduction to proceedings then hand<br>over to associate professor Janet<br>Stevenson who will introduce emeritus<br>IPL professor Tony Ballentine will give<br>a vote of thanks and then we'll welcome<br>you all and we'll welcome you all to the<br>staff club for refreshments afterwards<br>but I want to take this opportunity to<br>put this occasion and context of what is<br>an inaugural professorial lecture and<br>what does it mean for us at the<br>University for us here in the in the<br>academic executive and other academic<br>leaders actually to be perfectly honest<br>this is spa academic spa time for us we<br>get a chance to disengage from all of<br>the things that we are busy with<br>administration and other very productive<br>activities and actually step back and<br>remind ourselves what it is to be a<br>professor at the University by listening<br>to one of our newest professors<br>professor about<br>they're their research or their<br>scholarship so it is a celebration of<br>all that means to become a professor at<br>the University of Otago and so we can<br>look back to our foundations in our<br>found four founding professors Scot<br>shamed black and sail and from that time<br>we've set high standards for who has the<br>right to this particular academic title<br>whether appointed from afar or grown<br>from within it has characteristics in an<br>hour promotion vernacular we use terms<br>such as sustained outstanding leadership<br>and concept competence and also<br>sustained excellence and leadership in<br>in at least two of the three quarry area<br>core academic areas of teaching research<br>and service and if and that performance<br>has to be at the highest possible level<br>in two of the three it has to be only<br>excellent in the third of those three or<br>even sustained and outstanding in order<br>for the promotion to go through so one<br>can't compromise excellence in any of<br>those areas of teaching research or<br>service in order to gain this highest of<br>status in the university and then when<br>the standards are met we do like to we<br>do like to celebrate by putting on an<br>occasion like this so as I said my duty<br>here here tonight is to be emcee and<br>allow allow the event to happen so I<br>won't take too much of your time but<br>usually it's also an opportunity to talk<br>at a high level about what kind of<br>attributes that the inaugural<br>professorial lecturer has bought through<br>to enable them to achieve that promotion<br>or appointment and its qualities of<br>excellence leadership and service that<br>that have to be distinguished and<br>usually we call upon international<br>academic referees to give an unbiased<br>viewpoint and often I'll I'll summarize<br>some of the some of the narrative that<br>might have come through those kind of<br>reports but here I plan to depart from<br>the script not because we don't have<br>glowing references in your case Meritor<br>I can assure you that we do in from<br>people of great manner but because I<br>have had the pleasure and privilege to<br>work with you directly and could give my<br>own testimonial about the kinds of<br>attributes that you that you have bought<br>that have meant that this is the right<br>promotion for you so for reference and<br>information much of Mirrors time here at<br>the University of Otago has been through<br>a joint appointment with the University<br>of Auckland yes we do love and work well<br>with our friends from the north and that<br>was because she has had a very important<br>national role as a director of the james<br>hillier a maori research centre which<br>particularly because it has a focus on<br>particular issues was quite right to be<br>hosted at the university of auckland but<br>we were we had the great privilege to<br>have part of your time during that<br>period here and because of that your<br>emeritus functional reporting here at<br>Otago was through to me as the DVC for<br>research and enterprise so it's great I<br>actually here head one academic staff<br>member to go through regular review with<br>and it was always very very pleasurable<br>to talk to you I say as a physicist and<br>not as an indigenous anthropologist to<br>talk to you and understand what your<br>aspirations were in terms of your plans<br>academic and professional development<br>for the year ahead but also to gain an<br>understanding of how the work that you<br>were doing both here and up in the north<br>was designed to make a real impact on<br>the people in the communities that you<br>were working with I had the great<br>privilege then through that to get to<br>know and work alongside Jim Peters who<br>was your mentor up in Auckland and a<br>very special occasion was for me to go<br>up with you to Waitangi for a for a Hui<br>that I remember very clearly to this day<br>then since taking on the wise decision<br>to cut your commuting and committed to<br>Otago mera to has been had a change in<br>that functional reporting line through<br>into the division of humanities which is<br>and specifically through the centre of<br>sustainability which is why Janet as<br>Stevenson will be doing the formal<br>introduction now I've given some<br>indication of areas that through an<br>academic service leadership and<br>excellence have meant that I think your<br>promotion is very very warranted but I'd<br>like to also talk about some of the<br>other qualities actually in looking at<br>your CV some of the other academic<br>qualities are expressed not so much in<br>the in some of the formal things that we<br>identify monographs edited volumes<br>journal articles international journal<br>articles but I noted and mirror to CV<br>there is a category we call creative<br>works bracket refereed in which there<br>are 25 items listed these items are<br>items that are of great significance of<br>providing reports for bodies such as the<br>Waitangi tribunal multiple times the<br>High Court of New Zealand UNESCO crown<br>forestry tupuna cookery and other<br>agencies through which your advice is<br>sought and your scholarship is sought to<br>provide important support for matters of<br>concern to you your II we are happy in<br>there and the communities through which<br>your research and scholarship is there<br>to serve and I guess I haven't seen that<br>service directly except through<br>articulation and your CV but what I have<br>seen directly is that as a member of<br>communities of interest here in Dunedin<br>actually the fact that your kids and my<br>kids go to similar schools and we see<br>you around I can see that you have the<br>same levels of commitment leadership and<br>service to family in and our local<br>communities that extend far beyond that<br>academic service that to me make it very<br>very clear and abundant that this is a<br>most deserving promotion and and I'm<br>very very privileged to be able to give<br>this brief introduction to you now so<br>with that it's now my pleasure to hand<br>over to associate professor Stevenson to<br>formally introduce you and the topic of<br>tena koutou katoa I'll just start by<br>acknowledging the manaphy noir of Napoli<br>that all he with within which we are<br>sitting tonight the wrong at irrigated<br>here's a day from the University and<br>more widely and I'd like to extend a<br>special welcome to

for<br>sustainability I'm privileged to have<br>the role of introducing Meritor at this<br>very special occasion Mira is a research<br>professor at the Center for<br>sustainability and has an adjunct role<br>at t2 mu I'm particularly pleased to be<br>able to share with you a little of merit<br>his contributions to date because as<br>those of you who will know who well will<br>agree she epitomizes

some of whom are here today her<br>research on aspects of Maori development<br>and entrepreneurship has received<br>funding over many years from the marsden<br>fund forced directly from Erie and hapu<br>and also the National Science challenged<br>our land and water and in that project<br>for example which is still current she<br>heads a major maori researcher lead<br>program involving multiple Maori<br>communities investigating community<br>innovations and land-use and economic<br>development and just last week she<br>learnt of the success of her new Marsden<br>project which we'll explore how<br>connected Marty youth are with their<br>Merritt has many books and academic<br>papers offer new insights on topics of<br>critical importance to Maori and<br>Zealanders generally kaitiakitanga<br>connectionist and land connectedness to<br>marae and Maori values leadership and<br>entrepreneurship weaving these themes<br>together Meritus talk tonight is about<br>how her naughty far to her hapu at<br>AutoKey in Auckland have made the<br>strange familiar how they've made<br>opportunity out of a challenge and a<br>story of innovation and the leadership<br>resources that have seen this hub who<br>consider a fledgling business proposal<br>to regain central business district land<br>it was a completely new world for them<br>that they were entering into and yet<br>they made the strange familiar resulting<br>in new prosperity for the hapu and for<br>many others besides this is the story<br>that Meritor will tell for us tonight<br>noreda tena koutou tena koe you

good your name I do not go to do you<br>not go to go to my tattoo actually well<br>just before I get into this I would like<br>to just acknowledge those who have also<br>won a Marsden I do know a little bit<br>about Marsden's I suppose and how much<br>hard work is required so I just wanted<br>to acknowledge that would you for that<br>it's you know I just want to acknowledge<br>all those who have put in the Mazda and<br>then pips the Marsden gods didn't quite<br>look so favorably this year but you know<br>but a tenacious Ness and we've talked<br>about this persistence and there you'll<br>get there so stick it out all right well<br>the other thought I had just before I<br>get into my talk tonight I was looking<br>at the title of what I came up with what<br>we came up with over a B or T making the<br>strange familiar and you know these IP<br>hours on the one hand they're kind of<br>familiar aren't they<br>when you're on the backside we're on<br>this side they aren't somebody or<br>whatsoever so for me I think you know<br>maybe for all of us day to day perhaps<br>we we see or we encounter the strange<br>with the unusual the unfamiliar so you<br>got to try and make sense of it in some<br>way give a try and make it familiar<br>maybe you do that how do you do it you<br>have a reference set of values maybe or<br>a worldview to try and make sense of<br>these things these strange things so you<br>know for me that this I feel that is<br>completely unfamiliar so I started off<br>with just a little me just a little one<br>and then I have a little corridor you<br>know I think I'm gonna maybe finish off<br>with a whiter beauty so it's my funny<br>way of making this strange situation of<br>an IPL familiar and I suppose the other<br>thought I heard about these IPL's is<br>that you know how often do you actually<br>give a talk that's in a row<br>I read one quite rude it's a listen up<br>very often and it's not particularly<br>familiar but I just wanted to mention<br>there it's a funny thought I didn't<br>really think of this a little bit when I<br>was just coming in the door bet 20<br>minutes ago and I thought well goodness<br>you know was this robe actually as<br>familiar it's it's kind of a strange<br>familiarity I've grown up for many many<br>years when I was little<br>obviously I hadn't even started<br>University it's maybe about 60 years old<br>and yeah it's a little long I can go<br>into it somewhat but it belonged to my<br>father so it's similar from that point<br>of view as though so this how my mind is<br>working trying to make the strange<br>familiar all the time all right so I've<br>been told I have around 45 minutes or so<br>to speak so I do have a little Cordy dog<br>thing that I want to share with you well<br>again<br>Vice Chancellor deputy Vice Chancellor<br>Valentine Kyoto couture<br>thank you all for taking the time out to<br>come at this time of year I just don't<br>know how you guys have the energy to do<br>these things you do it so often with all<br>the things that you do is say thank you<br>because I know people are quite busy at<br>this time of year with conferences and<br>actually it was a quite a few of our<br>colleagues that are getting our PI<br>conference in Auckland at the moment so<br>thank you for making the time to come<br>right now<br>she thought that I might get away of<br>doing a Richard Blakey also into a<br>multi-time I feel 10 or so years down<br>the check because it has snowed in<br>Venice and once out the back door of<br>2019 but not so and Here I am and Here I<br>am also following on from my phone Anja<br>professor Michelle Thompson 413 aqua who<br>just two weeks ago spoke about the<br>challenges that we as academics<br>an institution faced in terms of<br>broadening and supporting Maori academic<br>scholarship across all disciplines and<br>across all levels and I think in<br>relation to that a second related matter<br>is understanding is the understanding<br>within the university of rangatiratanga<br>within university policies and<br>strategies and facilitating the<br>integration of mato dongha into courses<br>and into teaching as it contributes to<br>addressing problems facing our world we<br>have some good challengers and I really<br>did like the riddle that you presented a<br>couple of weeks ago but I see them all<br>says opportunities ahead of us for<br>instance to lead as an institution of<br>mari research excellence Otago to lead<br>as an institution that integrates multi<br>teaching practices into learning to lead<br>as an institution that values its 2d<br>based partnership with Kota who the<br>O'Connor and other kinds of<br>relationships that aren't necessarily<br>treaty based but are the kinds of<br>relationships with other eery and hapu<br>and to be an institution that can<br>provide the best nurturing ground for<br>I do have just a so that those are just<br>some pretty many ideas that I have<br>before I get into my talk and I have<br>another frame I suppose of reference for<br>what I will get into in a moment as<br>citizens of all Teodoro we're often told<br>of the poor performance and the<br>underperformance of Maori in all areas<br>of all major areas of socioeconomic life<br>just go online go into the newspapers<br>and you'll see the pictures and the<br>statistics are sobering and they are<br>worrisome especially for me<br>as I think of my phone Oh yo who live<br>without electricity from the main grid<br>up north and the bear violence the<br>others who are on the inside the others<br>again who only cars which are thee homes<br>and the many aunts and uncles and<br>cousins whose metallicy who have been<br>the outcome of diabetes these heaps of<br>them and mental illness as well I could<br>go on but what I want to say is that for<br>much of my academic and active research<br>career I have been driven by a deeply<br>ingrained desire or interest to find the<br>positives the solutions the models<br>innovations and the leadership practices<br>and the like that have been able to<br>communities to to prosper and so on<br>these topics I to giveth Paul have spent<br>much of my time with our communities to<br>find out what the inspirations are<br>working with them and helping them to<br>see those aspirations become real now<br>it's a kind of cycle as we would often<br>say in social sciences a research and<br>service<br>recognizing that solutions don't<br>actually would necessarily come from the<br>opsite labs or even from the halls of<br>the university but rather or actually<br>and in many cases they come from the<br>people themselves<br>and they must all of this of course has<br>meant that I've had to become trained in<br>the scholarship of drinking what I cups<br>of tea and in bones and through her<br>research that's just quite fine for me<br>fortunately for me the Armada scholars<br>and leaders before me stretching over<br>many generations in which for me provide<br>much inspiration for my talk tonight and<br>for my research in terms of how all have<br>navigated or have shaped new pathways<br>for improving their social<br>economic environmental war environmental<br>world's of their people so a feed and a<br>gutter of ninety point oh we know<br>instigated several initiatives to revive<br>tell moldy concerning our language<br>tickler and motto Dunga museums and what<br>I along with my deal and initiatives<br>many many things that he did and then I<br>turned to who you hear from the furnace<br>mitimiti Penfold<br>she was a champion of today laude and<br>among her many achievements she<br>translated a Shakespeare play into Maori<br>and before that she helped my father<br>Hugh and his work on interpreting<br>Hammadi texts of T TD T so that we could<br>now party Hawker is another who I look<br>to is not the first but I believe the<br>second Marty Warren to have graduated<br>we've gone to Oxford and studied Social<br>Anthropology the first being marketed to<br>Papa could of Tarawa I think from the<br>1930s or so it's amazing a Marty woman<br>in Oxford in the nineteen thirties and<br>follow and here she did a special branch<br>of anthropology called Museum<br>ethnography it's correct and I just have<br>to point us out of it I think there's<br>only ever been one other that's<br>graduated from Oxford in this particular<br>discipline Museum ethnography and he's<br>sitting in the front row right here also<br>from Tarawa<br>okay now party hall pay anyway and also<br>tune to some ACE and Jerry who leads<br>these little introduction here's an<br>alumnus of this university but suffice<br>to say that he has actually known me<br>longer then I knew who he was because I<br>ran around his Medaille has a<br>two-year-old we lived in Hanson or my<br>dad as an academic there or when I<br>climbed high up<br>this palm tree in his backyard to prove<br>to his son now ahead of Marty studies<br>MSE that I could so there's a score to<br>settle between this university and bet<br>University there are many others that I<br>could mention but is the couple here I<br>just briefly will and you know he Walker<br>was a key mentor of mine at Marty<br>studies at Auckland University he thrust<br>me into a role of her tutoring during<br>his big stage one paper I think had<br>about sitting tutorial classes said she<br>just not belong out of high school and<br>there are others there's magnet more TV<br>feisty lady from the North different<br>tribe only there many others Sir James<br>here not a Thea the one in the middle is<br>who Hannah bubbles machinery from tau to<br>where for most guide of the faculty<br>widower village and an incredible weaver<br>and of course her to who hipper to could<br>all tomorrow my worker and the many who<br>worked tirelessly for Alma Rai to keep<br>the heart of our communities alive so in<br>a way I feel I am just really a small<br>part of a Papa of Marley<br>intellectualism and service though more<br>importantly for me service and in<br>tonight it is to these people that I<br>acknowledge and would like to say how<br>much do I also think of tonight not as<br>an IPO for a body research professor who<br>has been an academic here for the last<br>eight or so years maybe nine or as an<br>academic who is who has had a split<br>identities scheduling to universities<br>the other one in this one for much of<br>that time instead I think of tonight as<br>an opportunity to share something from<br>my kitty of research so I'm going to<br>tell a story the corridor story I want<br>to share with you is essentially about<br>how innovation within the complex and<br>challenging circumstance<br>of Tel Modi is having an immense impact<br>on a community well a whole city that is<br>New Zealand's largest city of Auckland<br>and the innovation will continue to have<br>great significance for generations to<br>come<br>the story is effectively about a hub ooh<br>I think of around 4,000 there abouts who<br>despite having been completely landless<br>have come to be one of the most wealthy<br>American communities per capita in our<br>nation this quarter acre was a cemetry<br>right there 1951 but I like to deviate a<br>little I'm sorry but I got one last<br>deviation I have a fear that a few<br>further preliminaries to make including<br>some words of gratitude anyway no this<br>but I just have to say it in particular<br>I would like to acknowledge mr. Davis<br>geek it was known me now since I was<br>about half my age back when we first met<br>I had the fortune of being opposite<br>professors geek and a committee and we<br>were discussing and debating and having<br>dialogue of big issues of the world in<br>of New Zealand I was trying to sour<br>sound all-knowing and knowledgeable you<br>know I was 22 but I was in a room of<br>professors a QC a lawyer and other<br>equally impressive leaders who actually<br>were knowledgeable however I must have<br>said something right because I was very<br>grateful to have been given a nod by<br>professors gig and his committee to take<br>up a scholarship that was being offered<br>to study in England I was very excited<br>as I had no expectations whatsoever<br>about the scholarship and at the time I<br>remember being quite chuffed to get a<br>free plane trip from Walt hunter<br>Wellington actually there the big one<br>was for me and I still remember<br>exceptionally clearly is to go beyond<br>those big gates down and Wellington near<br>the base and reserve it and see what's<br>on the other side<br>it was all quite a buzz so after the<br>committee hearing off I went back to<br>Auckland and a few months later I packed<br>my bags and Landers in the UK I remember<br>arriving at my university my new new<br>University and thinking I'm here and now<br>what it was a completely new lingo to<br>learn digs and Dawn's DPhil if not phd's<br>matriculation going down kit instead of<br>sports gear and all sorts of other<br>things and my favorite was what are you<br>reading which was not a question about a<br>book that I might have actually been<br>reading it wasn't said a question about<br>what he's studying what's your<br>discipline suddenly I felt that the<br>familiar but strange feeling was taking<br>hold and I also realized I was around<br>twelve thousand miles away from home<br>fortunately though I had a risky team of<br>two other young budding Maori who<br>arrived a few days before me and some<br>notes are welcome I'm a leader pidgin<br>box at college on day two care of my new<br>fan oh they took me on a cultural<br>orientation to her so I could settle in<br>and I could say ah okay<br>this is home and actually it is like<br>home I made the strange familiar and I<br>realized I was actually already and a<br>half and they have fuddy to pronoun and<br>they have Moriah fadak I their beautiful<br>photo Katia and of course there was a<br>very deep of her stretching back<br>many hundreds of years to to pronoun who<br>had made my college what it is today<br>so I thought I was actually very very<br>lucky<br>strangely everything was familiar and<br>everything was really made for me also I<br>like to think now it might seem a bit<br>odd for someone to be thinking hamari<br>world views or philosophy regarding an<br>ancient<br>venerated English education system but I<br>would like to acknowledge and remember<br>these two well the values that they have<br>been instilled in me from an early age<br>this is they said to me anything is<br>possible with hard work compassion what<br>may appear as challenges are only<br>opportunities and while the prison or<br>the future may seem uncertain or even<br>strange you already have a toolkit of<br>tell MALDI it will provide a frame and<br>from that frame you can see the world<br>and it will also keep you focused on<br>what is important to you you'll just be<br>you'll also be surrounded by familiarity<br>suggest embrace it in a way these basic<br>ideas of making the strange familiar of<br>making opportunity out of challenge has<br>been the very essence of my EE of 94<br>whose resilience in the face of<br>significant hardships poverty and<br>complete land loss has enabled them to<br>grow in to prosper so let me introduce<br>mattify to her to you again rolling on<br>for Michelle and get back to the story<br>so right now I have about a 2 to 3<br>minute film flip to just show you this<br>is this is a little corridor that I had<br>with one of my coma to a tip owner Danny<br>Taylor hi who talks about significant<br>loss of the Medaille and the burning<br>down of the meeting house when he was a<br>little boy demin or cow eBay you would<br>must all of us the point about this is<br>that this period in the artifact his<br>recent history has seeded the internal<br>fires the significant internal fires<br>within those who later came to do<br>everything that they could to regain as<br>much title of ancestral land in Auckland<br>I was here man when when we're evict<br>from the puppet Ranga upon the hill here<br>that that kind of what what happened in<br>those days took away<br>I just took away from me the memory of<br>holding on because if you hold on to<br>stories and you wanted to recognize it<br>then it's good to pass them on to others<br>and unfortunately when we were moved we<br>were we had number I we would that was<br>terror from us and that's what I believe<br>killed a lot of our old people but we<br>grew up and my true my I'm sure had<br>generations are having no no mirai<br>upbringing there was nothing that we<br>could do the closest thing we could do<br>was win tongue is took place in the<br>Kaipara in reality inherently then we<br>had a little bit of them are a part of<br>it because when Chinese were hell here<br>when we were rethink that they were held<br>on the tarpaulins on our front laws we<br>we didn't have this place that I'm<br>speaking with you today the thing that<br>stands out for me on the particular<br>thing I'm president as the wailing mr.<br>weighing that took over and but one<br>thing I'm still trying to<br>I couldn't understand is that when<br>things were burning especially the the<br>meeting council I remember it I was on<br>fire when I saw it but I remember the<br>waning that was going on thing I<br>distinctly remember there was the smoke<br>coming from the from the boudoir tamaki<br>it didn't<br>expect smoke to go straight up in the<br>air it floated flare across the<br>waterfront in the smoke sea to settle on<br>the water I just I just couldn't<br>understand it it just it floated across<br>the water froze and settled on water and<br>wind out that way I there I click open<br>and there may be knots of wind or<br>something I was blamed that day but it<br>just didn't seem but you get that kind<br>of combination you get the combination<br>of the waiting that was going on and<br>there you know that can really affect<br>the person when you win the people that<br>you love me for so it took a lot to make<br>my people cry earlier but there I and<br>waiting together was something that I<br>I can I can never ever forget it it just<br>so cool Danny's just giving you a little<br>bit of a snapshot and to the ultimate<br>low point in our recent history but 95<br>to has come a very very long way in a<br>very short time so what happened there<br>at that time is some people that are<br>still alive today as I said it seeded<br>the internal fires within the leaders<br>today to do something about regaining as<br>much title of ancestral land as they can<br>so let's have a look at them at this<br>story some years ago in the 90s there<br>was a period of great change your RK<br>treaty claim had recently been settled<br>three million dollars in cash and<br>housing stock along Cooper Street in<br>Auckland's just behind the Marais had<br>been returned as part of that settlement<br>and a fire actually had also occurred in<br>the Safari Nui<br>scorching carvings and other parts of<br>the house so they were major things<br>happening it was difficult to imagine<br>anything else on any large or<br>transformative scale happening<br>especially also against a history of<br>significant loss but exactly this was<br>emerging a fledgling business proposal<br>to regain central business district land<br>was being considered the idea seemed<br>audacious at the time foreign and local<br>corporate giants and other hopefuls were<br>eager to capitalize on the opportunity<br>as well and there was much positioning<br>and much posturing the author R K was<br>just a little happy it was a completely<br>new world for them to be entering into<br>it was notable so that given that we<br>were talking about a chunk of central<br>city land that was at the time a<br>derelict residue of forgotten days when<br>Aucklanders Trevor<br>to the city via rail but all that was<br>left<br>we're disused railway tracks a formally<br>majestic Grand Central Station and<br>plenty of weeds broken glass and<br>graffiti cupboards platforms so I simply<br>wanted to know more about this land<br>proposal was it a pipe dream was it real<br>I just wanted to know how could 90 fart<br>will be considering such a thing given<br>the total lack of precedent and zero<br>commercial track record from an included<br>researcher perspective one that saw me<br>as a member of the community in general<br>article terms and which gave me access<br>to information and you're also<br>recognizing that I was an outsider to<br>the actual events I was able to delve<br>into the records of the innovation talk<br>easily with the data their leaders<br>involved and also be one step removed<br>from what happened and also much of the<br>discussions occurred several years later<br>so let's go back to the mid-1990s around<br>that time the hobby was in the midst of<br>a militia treaty claim who care for who<br>I bought the government and he asked it<br>was a provocative challenge that sought<br>the commitments of the government to sit<br>down with him and other community<br>representatives in address historical<br>grievances relating to the loss of the<br>lands and tamaki I don't have time to<br>talk about the the claim tonight which<br>is a major subject in itself but the<br>same question was figuratively asked<br>again of the government in relation to<br>the railway lands the government at the<br>time wanted to get the lens off its<br>books and sell them because they were<br>surplus to requirements and so the happy<br>was seeking or rather demanding that the<br>crown come to their party to hear their<br>views on the railway land policy and<br>quite simply 94<br>to add one thing in mind to reacquire it<br>formally fishing grounds with a fishing<br>camp on its edges these lands had been<br>reclaimed and later turned into railway<br>lands with this Grand Central Station<br>the opportunity to once again secure<br>title was something that the hapu could<br>not pass up 90 file to boldly moved into<br>the unknown realm of crown negotiation<br>and commercial development they were<br>prepared to take very great financial<br>and political risks primarily on the<br>basis that they were armed with<br>expertise and whatever other resources<br>that they needed to make their ambition<br>a reality aside from the lack of<br>resources to begin with though their<br>possession was difficult also because<br>fundamentally it required them to test<br>the partnership principle with the crown<br>I mean thinking about an aspirational<br>future against a background and history<br>that had seen a total breakdown of this<br>relationship and in the process from<br>Marty fighters point of view the history<br>demonstrated a complete disregard by the<br>crown of them in the original land gift<br>in order for the city to be built<br>basically it was about having a<br>partnership or an agreement with the<br>contemplate that there were some key<br>things that enabled the hopparoo to<br>advance into the unknown to make the<br>strange familiar and to overcome yet<br>through the hurdles and you're quiet<br>large section of the CBD these were<br>essentially a reliance on values<br>encompassing mana which you can think of<br>as being about simply strength or<br>identity in authority and manake which<br>is about consideration of other's needs<br>and aspirations<br>the second element was a court a hunger<br>or unity and leadership especially in<br>relationship problem-solving the third<br>element was a combination of customer<br>leadership values and depending four<br>main leadership forms the first was<br>rangatiratanga which was about the<br>values of esteem leaders who are risk<br>alert the second leadership value<br>related to hamlet Unger or tahuna<br>who are specialists and who like I<br>Matilda are risk aware the third related<br>to Porter katana which are the<br>opportunity<br>seeking usually younger leaders who may<br>be risk takers and boundary pushes and<br>the fourth leadership value set derives<br>from Komar - or elders who are often<br>risk adverse and desire to preserve<br>customer endure and tikanga the fourth<br>element that secured the successes in IT<br>fighter was a strong accountability<br>ethic to the community of descendants<br>they lived locally in the fire and the<br>final fifth element was the reference to<br>history to remind him about what they<br>had lost and what they should now fight<br>for so this is about the regaining of<br>title of an ancestral estate from which<br>they can regrow the economy enable the<br>hapu to prosper these five elements are<br>effectively their principal elements of<br>Ahmadi kin community entrepreneurship<br>these values came to life from the<br>moment when happy leaders saw an<br>opportunity to obtain land and begin a<br>commercial enterprise<br>they continued throughout the enterprise<br>development including times when many<br>obstacles were thrown in the direction<br>and which threatened to derail the<br>process altogether the different level<br>of leadership perspectives<br>enabled the team to problem-solve and<br>maneuver around the problems all the<br>while keeping a focus on building a<br>transformative future for their<br>community to give one example of the<br>countability dimension it meant keeping<br>the parent trust board and the wider<br>community informed to progress this one<br>would expect accountability however was<br>more than just a one-way reporting<br>exercise it was about being transparent<br>about what was happening and it also<br>meant taking whatever questions came<br>from the floor your relations asking big<br>questions about what<br>think you are doing you're kidding we<br>are looking at millions of dollars very<br>tricky to be accountable and stand up to<br>your people and have an answer and find<br>answers with him notably also though<br>another element of accountability of the<br>leaders to the community was started<br>many years prior to the innovation and<br>it was essentially about these people<br>proving their worth to lead so nothing<br>to do with the railway stuff but they<br>had to first prove the ability their<br>rights if you like the responsibilities<br>to lead for some of you you might have<br>heard or know about bastion point or<br>Tucker Potiphar and the occupation this<br>was a momentous time in the recent<br>history of the hapu a key leader was Joe<br>Hawke who brought together many hundreds<br>of people to protest against the molding<br>government's proposal to acquire Tucker<br>potiphar land for public housing it was<br>also to Pune to mahai that's Joe a<br>strategic member of the hapu who<br>supported both Joe and the protesters as<br>well as elders along with Hugh who were<br>taking another pathway in talking with<br>the government to deal with the land<br>issues at the time these three people<br>were all leading in their own unique<br>ways back in the 1970s but essentially<br>they had to prove their worth to lead<br>and in the process the community was<br>given the opportunity to accept or to<br>reject the leadership this was<br>reciprocity in action and it was the<br>central ingredient in creating the<br>grounds for Entrepreneurship to<br>materialize some years later so what<br>we're talking about is these people were<br>developing entrepreneurship building<br>blocks fast forward to the 1990s all<br>three came to have central roles and<br>working together to obtain title to<br>throw Wayland's while they provided the<br>strategic links tonight if I 2a plus a<br>mix of customer leadership styles and<br>foci they are also joined by what we<br>would call talking out for specialists<br>in particular these included the<br>financial planner Patrick Sneden is<br>District Health Board right here I think<br>in various health functions and the key<br>strategist and lawyer now judge Chris<br>McGuire here on the right left so let's<br>briefly and quickly trace some of the<br>actual steps taken by what I call this<br>dream team talking along I Teeter Kumar<br>to a<br>Portagee around 1991 this is the core<br>but Joe saw that the government was<br>about to dispose surplus railway land he<br>was quick to let them about 95 to his<br>interest in it<br>it helped too that he had a physical<br>presence in the railway station if the<br>government was going to be difficult the<br>theatrics of occupation always that's<br>exactly what Joe did you see the scene<br>and what could his father's eyes role he<br>brought tutors and a training program<br>into the station he said to me we<br>basically took over that railway station<br>others got the message very quickly<br>everyone in fact vacated he said to me<br>my issue was to occupy it also just so<br>happened that Joe had another nifty plan<br>up her sleeve regarding occupation he<br>had some mates who had some cranes who<br>happened to cut and the largest worker<br>in the land and have it set right in the<br>I just said that it fishes with about an<br>inch either side of those doors and you<br>can actually see how beauty gets in 95 -<br>were there the message was pretty clear<br>according to Joe the 1970s taco potiphar<br>occupation was only yesterday and he<br>knew full well what occupation as a<br>strategy could achieve of course so too<br>did the government Joe's cunning plan<br>worked even if they were internal<br>rumblings with an article about the<br>strategy it's another story the<br>government backed off from one idea to<br>reutilize the land and basically not<br>allow 90 fire to her to purchase it at<br>all at the same time as this first<br>positioning joe hugh chris and pat got<br>together to scope out the next move and<br>problem-solve this was a critical time<br>because this government wanted to<br>conclude at surplus for our land policy<br>but it was no small thing for ninety<br>fighter because effectively they needed<br>millions and millions of dollars the<br>cost was actually more than the market<br>value and more than any other offer on<br>the table but not afar - were prepared<br>to pay for it because basically because<br>of the opportunities they saw and also<br>of course the cultural and historical<br>significance of the land in the area to<br>them the media and long-term future were<br>completely unknown contemplating what<br>the future could look like was a strange<br>and b rule during the ordering thing to<br>do but this is exactly what the team was<br>doing while fun finding the money was a<br>major issue other challenges world up<br>and threaten to derail the process one<br>of these challenges was at the original<br>crown department with whom ratify - I<br>had originally dealt with and discussing<br>this scope upper had suddenly become<br>defunct and it was replaced by another<br>this new department then tried to argue<br>that there was actually no deal it was<br>even the argument that the land was now<br>worth considerably more in fact almost<br>double the original agreed<br>just price the price tag was around 80<br>million dollars 90 fart was shocked at<br>this turn of events that the crown could<br>do this that they would massively<br>ratchet up the price and expect 95 to<br>just some 3s accepted notified to a<br>shocked also given the history of<br>Auckland we now have who had originally<br>generously offered much land to the<br>first government in New Zealand in 1840<br>and yet that fact seemed to count for<br>nothing<br>the issue was something about the honour<br>of the crown against the small<br>historical backdrop of course not if I<br>had been in respect foot situation only<br>a few years earlier so the big question<br>what to do the team along was the 95 to<br>a trust board then started staking out<br>the money to the crown as strongly as<br>they could<br>this meant developing a game of tactics<br>political maneuvering and putting hard<br>pressure on the crown in order to seek a<br>return to the original purchase price<br>agreement reinforcing the omona also<br>meant developing a very strong legal<br>gameplan times could not have been more<br>tense but the team were not going to lay<br>down resilience in the face of adversity<br>working together and again problem<br>solving were critical the notifier to<br>our members could easily recall the many<br>occasions when they had stood up against<br>major external pressures they didn't<br>always come out on top but they had<br>developed a up up a reserve of<br>precedent to battle and so with all<br>these resources precedents and<br>problem-solving tactics by August 1996<br>the crown finally relented tonight refer<br>to a pressure and agreed to sell at the<br>non inflation to price this is about<br>four years after the original agreement<br>as a side note and not because I<br>particularly want to deviate from the<br>story so far but he was a particular<br>character that graced his way into<br>ninety filters realm of existence this<br>character was a businessman I was<br>courted by a group of Maori from Tarawa<br>who were eyeing up the former Grand<br>Central Station with the idea of<br>the thing is they including this<br>businessman had not consulted notifier<br>to her about this in the early days of<br>the proposal and the hapu found<br>themselves on a little bit of a back<br>although the happy was aiming at<br>obtaining total and the casino proposal<br>was about the use of a building on the<br>land no real discussions had occurred<br>between the parties they did try<br>last-minute the businessmen might have<br>had the slickness of a well-oiled<br>publicity in business machine we he<br>thoughtfully remarked at the time how<br>beautiful and fabulous the site was but<br>he was only interested in one thing and<br>that did not really entail development<br>prospects to help nighty fire to her<br>suffice to say the businessman left New<br>Zealand and the casino bid was won by<br>Sky City a little bit up the road while<br>political and strategic issues took up<br>the bulk of the time to just get an<br>agreement to purchase there was still<br>the major issue of actually securing a<br>huge amount of money<br>40 million a business partner what<br>partner was needed and they also needed<br>bank support a major question was who<br>would be interested in partnering with a<br>little moldy group who had no track<br>record in business lose alone and major<br>commercial land or property development<br>specifically there were in fact many<br>air-gap hunters or tire kickers as Chris<br>described them but none had the<br>credibility or the commitment to follow<br>through one option canvassed involved<br>partnering with a Hong Kong developer<br>the chair of the night refer to a board<br>at the time respected elder Ruby grac'd<br>if we can get the land back I'm prepared<br>to wait 100 years what she meant was the<br>idea of allowing the Hong Kong group to<br>have the land for very little money for<br>100 years was okay because the land<br>would be secured by the development<br>presence although the Hong Kong proposal<br>fell through it enabled 90 fire to her<br>to do some more fine-tuning of the ideas<br>100 years was a very very long time with<br>no income will very very little income<br>from the land obtaining economic value<br>from the land within the current<br>lifetime became a central issue and so<br>the next step then became one of<br>focusing on this very issue I don't have<br>time to go into details but what I can<br>say is that 95 found a joint venture<br>partner who were able to provide the<br>money to improve the land subdivide it<br>and prepare the blocks for lease<br>wholesale leasehold sell and so now<br>because the hubby we had a major JV<br>partner<br>you took the major financial risks as<br>the major lease holder who would then<br>set out to sublease 90 far to earth<br>we're able to Merc pain title to the<br>land<br>another option figure ously discussed by<br>90 fighter leaders at the time was in<br>fact to logic claim with the Waitangi<br>tribunal in order to get the land back<br>selves discover back as Hugh remarked in<br>The Herald however despite our<br>confidence in the legitimacy of our<br>claim we have reached a point where<br>arguing with the crown for another 20<br>years made the solution with Magellan<br>with a JV partner economically sensible<br>in other words taking a treaty claim<br>claim was with deemed too risky you<br>might find that kind of interesting you<br>hear a lot about my reclaimer groups<br>making claims all the time through the<br>Tribune or the office of treaty of<br>course nothing and major commercial<br>property development is straightforward<br>even with a JV partner and considerable<br>concerns remained because leasehold<br>buying was very slow the apartment<br>market was slowing in retail space was<br>seen as having to compete with the<br>emerging in shopping malls popping up<br>throughout the suburbs David Jones<br>signed up to be an anchor tenant that<br>the importantly mapped out in 97 and<br>then the herald was all over the sir<br>saying one one comment was Christian's<br>inevitably arise as to how fast projects<br>may proceed and whether the sheer scale<br>of the area available may require<br>seductive deals to a site and trust the<br>future could not be more strained and<br>worrying one of the key strategies to<br>attract investors was as mentioned the<br>preparation of the land for sale by<br>overseeing the building of roads street<br>lighting pavements and other landscaping<br>another after considerable discussion<br>and further problem-solving by the team<br>another major incentive or seductive<br>deal offers the who will put it in order<br>to attract investors was decided upon<br>basically an artifact read that they<br>would offer<br>resold sections<br>years rent-free despite this extremely<br>difficult first phase a crucial fact was<br>nevertheless the reality lighting fire<br>to ernow head title to a significant<br>land area and it comprises a very large<br>chunk of the CBD equivalent around 40<br>football fields all the leasehold to<br>eventually bought and she loved it the<br>Mary's pay 40 million for sitting in the<br>the writers were even further further<br>Modi write it but Modi's this is just<br>the other day would even dream of<br>thinking of seeing such headlines in<br>their newspaper and so these are just<br>some images of the railway Lena what's<br>dear now as you would know for those<br>have been up there Grand Central Station<br>and the back there you enterpreneur both<br>explained a strategic weapon or resource<br>was the trust boards lawyer Chris<br>McGuire he was far more than a lawyer's<br>Vince would proof as a kind of tahuna or<br>expert in negotiation and tactics and in<br>law he was centrally involved in the<br>negotiations and where necessary made<br>vigorous representations to business<br>local or central government officials as<br>a key member of the team he proposed<br>pathways ideas and tactics tested them<br>out with further and the initiators and<br>lead discussions with Magellan the JV<br>partner he also provided protection to<br>90 fighter by standing out them dealing<br>with the opportunists were eager to<br>enter into some kind of partnership with<br>notifier to her to make a few bucks but<br>with little guard for anything else<br>Patrick's Eden was also modern-day<br>Tejano who despite not being of the<br>harpoon descent Tunes was bound to the<br>hapu and conceptions and whose financial<br>and business expertise would be critical<br>together these tactical skills were key<br>strategic resources combined with the<br>leadership resources of hugh joe<br>enterpreneur in entirely new ways that<br>had not been seen before in the<br>community the leadership valley is<br>celebrated a court a heating up<br>of difference embedded with them that<br>was a commonality of purpose the value<br>of monarchy which included the team's<br>trust and respect of each other<br>cooperation patience and a focus on<br>problem-solving I could give you a bit<br>more of a background but to have these<br>four individuals very very strong into<br>the three individuals and Natta fire to<br>come together against their history of<br>the 1970s would never imagine it but<br>they only in came to realize that they<br>each came from different leadership<br>perspectives the way they understand<br>risk in management and so they're<br>enabled those strengths of each of those<br>individuals to be really played out and<br>work together a called third tour of<br>difference the historical guides of the<br>1950s and seventies in the clonal period<br>before that acted as reference points to<br>the Hoopoe leaders they described<br>leadership actions that were carried out<br>the people with dimension and they<br>described resources that were important<br>the land dimension both of these things<br>helped to contextualize the railway<br>venture within this paper or<br>genealogy of notify to affairs at the<br>time when Harper was contemplating<br>buying surplus government-owned railway<br>land for forty million dollars my father<br>Reilly commented at the time that the<br>tribe didn't have forty cents<br>let alone forty million dollars and yet<br>here we are here we are seen now in the<br>seven hundred plus million dollar asset<br>base built in large part from this<br>railway lands innovation and these<br>people coming together not bad for a<br>small huh Fuu who had a strong sense of<br>and a combination of strategic customer<br>leadership values and approaches making<br>the strange familial normal where the<br>strange was the world of business<br>finance commercial land development was<br>what 90 fighter did there as much I<br>think that we came in from their journey<br>so that was the story and if there's one<br>last thing to say in relation to making<br>a strange but familiar idea it is that<br>Marty research professors are a strange<br>but somewhat familiar breed of academic<br>but they should be familiar and not a<br>strange breed of academic my last<br>comments therefore are to the next<br>generation of Marty scholars I look<br>forward to seeing you here this side<br>telling us about your corridor your<br>research journeys as Marty research<br>it's right I'm reminded here hearty home<br>Hey a hearty Harry were where am I<br>hey - hail our King and I might a<br>boo-boo Kiki you tight icky night to<br>take or - we are there for the poor<br>I know Katsuki white a mai tai you could<br>yeah<br>it<br>ah<br>Oh<br>tena koutou katoa<br>my name is Tony Valentine and I'm the<br>pro vice-chancellor humanities here at<br>the University and is with great<br>pleasure that I will deliver a vote of<br>thanks to Professor cough will do her<br>excellent lecture has been an<br>opportunity to share with us a powerful<br>story an account of some of the key<br>passages in the recent history of<br>naughty fart or the story is one of<br>transformation a process of rendering<br>the strange familiar it is the story of<br>naughty fart or happy seizing an<br>opportunity in remaking their world and<br>in their process also enacting<br>significant change significant<br>transformation within our largest city<br>and how act it is that railways in<br>railway land was central to that story<br>I'm a colonial historian so you know we<br>think a lot about railway infrastructure<br>and its centrality and the colonization<br>of other lands railways of course were<br>long celebrated as the engine for<br>colonial progress propelling the advance<br>of civilization but they were the<br>powerful instruments of clonal ization<br>the wooden and iron infrastructure that<br>enabled the colonial state to move<br>troops around and to reach into the<br>interior of these multitude to extend<br>the power of the colonial government and<br>the reach of colonial capitalism so<br>there is a wonderful irony that the<br>occupation and reacquisition of railway<br>land after this very protracted struggle<br>in which naughty far two leaders<br>exhibited great tenacity resourcefulness<br>intelligence in patience so it's<br>tremendous that it was railway land I<br>think incredibly symbolic that propelled<br>the ability of Nasaf Ottawa to envisage<br>a new future and to realize it at the<br>outset I think Marisa mentioned who<br>research kitty it's a very capacious<br>kitty I think and you share just one<br>story but it's an incredibly rich story<br>I think me later and it returns to some<br>of the key and recurring concerns that<br>run through your you were rising in your<br>work leadership innovation and<br>entrepreneurship and I think her talk<br>like her research has had people at its<br>center and it has underlined an<br>incredibly rich tradition of Maori<br>academic work and a potent tradition of<br>political leadership she noted that her<br>research has been focused on the<br>positive pushing away from a deficit<br>framing to think about solutions to<br>think about new models of organization<br>new ways of thinking in doing but at the<br>same time she has highlighted the<br>immense resources that come from an<br>appreciation of history from the weight<br>of tradition from the cultivation of<br>leadership and from a holding on to<br>identity into a sense of belonging in<br>the face of great injustice and<br>inequality so professor Cafferty we have<br>come together to listen to you to hear<br>your thoughts and we've greatly in<br>Georgia lecture and I think it's given a<br>lot for us to think about but there's<br>been a fantastic opportunity to come<br>together collectively to join in the<br>celebration of your promotion so invite<br>you in a moment to join with me in<br>congratulating Melissa I have a gift to<br>present to her which somebody kindly sir<br>kindly arranged earlier and I'll<br>encourage you all to join us in the<br>staff club for some refreshments and to<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
