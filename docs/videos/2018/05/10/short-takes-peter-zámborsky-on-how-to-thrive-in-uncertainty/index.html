Paykel<br>appliances an innovative design led<br>company successful in the white goods<br>sector while acquisitions seem to be a<br>good tool for companies to grow and<br>recombine their resources there are some<br>challenges in particular related to<br>rising protectionism while high was<br>cleared for its acquisitions in the US<br>and indeed in New Zealand other<br>companies from China such as Ali Baba or<br>telecoms giants who are way in CD<br>recently faced restrictions either on<br>the investment in the US or on the trade<br>with US companies even companies from<br>countries other than China might get<br>entangled in this increased<br>protectionist sentiments and measures by<br>countries such as the United States the<br>u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum<br>initially targeted mostly China actually<br>covered broad range of countries and New<br>Zealand for example was not exempted<br>from these recent measures in summary a<br>digital disruption the rise of China and<br>India and increase anti global ISM and<br>protectionism are going to contribute to<br>heightened uncertainty in the world<br>business environment companies would be<br>advised to invest in three types of<br>capabilities to face these challenges<br>first sensing context second driving the<br>market and a third redesigning the<br>business this can be done both<br>internally and externally through<br>partnerships and possibly equity<br>sessions of companies from other<br>countries</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
