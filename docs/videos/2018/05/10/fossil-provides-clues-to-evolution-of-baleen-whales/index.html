font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>this fossil quail is from rocks that<br>have been dated about 34 to 35 million<br>years that's about halfway back to the<br>age of the dinosaurs<br>it was quite early on in the history of<br>whales the fossil is one of the oldest<br>and the lineage of baleen whales the<br>baleen whales are living wild and they<br>are big filter feeders we know that they<br>came from ancient ancestors long ago<br>beyond 40 million years but the record<br>of those ancestors is a very fragmentary<br>it was from Antarctica astonishing it<br>was found in to those actually one<br>fragment was found in the mid-1970s by<br>an American geologist who took it back<br>to the state and people were intrigued<br>by that I went to see more Island on<br>Antarctica what that paleontologist and<br>he told me he found it over there so I<br>went to look I found nothing I found<br>nothing and I kept hunting for fossils<br>which was my job at the time keep<br>hunting for fossils and one day I was<br>working out on the east side of the<br>island opposite from where I normally<br>came and the width I started to pick up<br>and I've got a bit concerned about that<br>I wondered if there was going to be a<br>whiteout and so I took a different track<br>back to the camp and as I walked up a<br>gully towards the top of the island I<br>started seeing fragmented bone and then<br>I found a chunk of rock a chunk of rock<br>with a couple of teeth in it you know I<br>thought this is a big whale and it was<br>we collected every fragment that we<br>could find on that specimen maybe a ton<br>of blocks of rock and bone and put them<br>together and strip the rock away off the<br>outside and revealed the bone on the<br>inside so we've ended up with a<br>three-dimensional specimen which we can<br>use to tell the story of the origin of<br>the baleen whales baleen whales are<br>still living all around the Earth by<br>living in waters often eat and we see<br>right well<br>cruising past and humpback whales these<br>are the modern baleen whales and this is<br>very close to their aims history the<br>original fragment of this individual<br>quail the very same animal is curated in<br>the Smithsonian Institution in<br>Washington DC so we found the rest of<br>the specimen and had prepared it out<br>have now described it and it's only<br>gripe that this specimen goes in its<br>entirety back to Washington DC yeah it's<br>really thrilling in a way for those of<br>us who work on this sort of thing the<br>specimen turned out to be much more<br>revealing than I had ever expected and<br>we can tell some good stories about the<br>origins of baleen whales from this this<br>very animal well when we were first<br>working on the specimen that had<br>structures which suggested it might have<br>had a filter feeding apparatus the big<br>baleen plates that hang from the roof of<br>modern whales but on close inspection<br>the pattern of bone features just wasn't<br>quite right and so we've decided that<br>this animal was probably a suction<br>feeder had opened its mouth and top and<br>large volumes of prey and squirted water<br>out again so retaining the food in the<br>mouth this is a little bit different<br>from from filter feeding from serving<br>directly from the water it'll be a bit<br>contentious I know some people will<br>think well maybe it truly was a filter<br>feeder or not a suction feeder so we've<br>made a case and we'll see how its<br>received</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
