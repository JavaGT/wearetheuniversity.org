We will set out the DHB and PHO’s Primary and Community Care Action Plan for this and coming years, how we are working with secondary services, and how we need your help: our ability to implement the Action Plan will depend on whether we are bold enough and prepared to do things differently and make challenging decisions around our practices and priorities.<br><br>Presented by: Dr Nigel Millar, Chief Medical Officer, Southern DHB<br>and Dr Doug Hill Chair, WellSouth PHO and GP, at Broadway Medical Centre, Dunedin. <br><br>This presentation was held as a Dunedin School of Medicine Grand Round

koe Toto guitar<br>Thank You Barry for introduction I'm<br>Nigel mother um I trying to buy this<br>biases buying Bing a geriatrician but<br>kind of comes into the picture<br>and we here to talk about having a<br>primary community strategy so I'll just<br>get started um how do we do this muted<br>here's the keyboardist stuck oh yeah<br>right<br>and really one of the one of the reasons<br>for giving this talk today is to is to<br>introduce the primary community strategy<br>to the audience particularly in the<br>hospital specialist services because it<br>has a relevance and what does it mean<br>for you um first of all why do we need<br>the primary can be scheduled one is why<br>do we need a strategy a strategy is not<br>a list of actions okay if you have a<br>strategy and a clear goal for where you<br>want to be in the long run it allows you<br>to develop a series of actions but it<br>keeps you focus in the long run you<br>don't lose direction you have an overall<br>place you're going and when<br>opportunities arise and things change<br>you can respond to those opportunities<br>because you don't know what's going to<br>change the landscape of next year may be<br>something you come up some new<br>government funding some new policy some<br>new opportunity and if you have a<br>strategy you know how to respond to that<br>that's particularly important not just<br>the actions we start with it's the fact<br>we've got a consistent set of goals that<br>we're kind of signed up to and it quite<br>often we get lost in today lost in<br>solving the problems are in front of us<br>and we forget we need to solve them in a<br>way that enables it to be sustainable<br>for the future and it and it's very<br>difficult when you got your head down<br>trying to solve things that you if you<br>lose lose the track of where you're<br>going you're in difficulties and that's<br>quite common problem and big<br>organizations<br>it's a why primary community strategy<br>well you could look at the health system<br>sometimes it looks whether this there's<br>kind of ends of the boat and you've got<br>no hope if you're in the end it isn't<br>sinking because you're going down with<br>it so whole balance is important that<br>that there's a schism developing a<br>health system and using a model is if<br>the primary community health services<br>start to struggle<br>can't meet the needs of people then more<br>people go to hospital then the hospital<br>is struggling so it needs more resources<br>in the current system the way the HP's<br>are set up the hospitals are magnetic<br>when it comes to resources if you work<br>in a hospital and you look to what<br>happened in primary community service is<br>quite off they're asked to cope with<br>last year's money that's the sort of<br>thing that happens because the<br>contracted services you can use write it<br>in the contract and so you can see a<br>vicious thing can arise where whereby<br>the hospital needs more resources to<br>keep doing this stuff so there's less<br>available for the community some more<br>people go to hospital you can see where<br>that's going to go and that's the one of<br>the fundamental reasons we have to get<br>this right a cars in the world the bulk<br>of healthcare encounters by far happened<br>well away from the hospital premises and<br>they had to have happened to an arrange<br>of community providers and also in<br>general practice so we need a strategy<br>to so we know how to make keep this show<br>on the road but do something creative<br>but expectations of people are changing<br>people want on the whole to take a<br>greater interest in their own health<br>care to take decisions for themselves<br>like me my job description apparently<br>says hypertension in the line so I take<br>the pills and measure my blood pressure<br>but that doesn't kind of fit with the<br>current system at the moment when I see<br>my GP you know where do you want them<br>uploaded doesn't kind of work though and<br>and this is a theme we'll see and<br>self-care is is the option so you we<br>know that people with diabetes can do an<br>amazing amount themselves we know the<br>top of scope of practice for patients is<br>home hemodialysis so we have an<br>opportunity there to help people take a<br>greater role in our own health care<br>doesn't work for everyone we're not just<br>handing you know saying you get on your<br>own how do we do that as a partnership<br>and then we will we have a way of<br>engaging with people looking to the<br>future and what's going to happen with<br>technology with there's a big risk here<br>that if a substantive body of the<br>population engages in online health care<br>with other new providers and we're not<br>ready for it that could severely<br>undermine our primary care<br>which i think is a fundamental part of<br>our success as a health system in the<br>world because New Zealand's health<br>system although we see all its problems<br>and all its warts actually does<br>comparatively well compared to other<br>health systems in the world and one of<br>the foundations of primary can if we<br>under my if that's undermine<br>substantially then we could get into<br>real difficulties because if we take<br>away the easy stuff the low you know we<br>could actually remove funding from<br>primary care and leave them less able to<br>do the more complex things which are<br>going to be the hardest things to do<br>online anyway so those digital tools are<br>coming our way I haven't seen the answer<br>yet you know the real killer application<br>but it's gonna somewhere is going to pop<br>up you know the iPhone or the Android no<br>the smartphone it's only about 12 years<br>ago only 12 years ago so you can see how<br>quickly things could change and one<br>would imagine they will change every<br>other part of enterprise apart from<br>education and law notice about very but<br>haven't you know of caught up with this<br>stuff and you expect to do it all online<br>it's a strange thing in health we<br>haven't quite kind of that got to that<br>yet our problems<br>you know we've got we've got inequities<br>marry death rates three times what you'd<br>expect if they weren't Maori in this<br>part of the world a lot of people in res<br>the hospital in residential care despite<br>the fact we provide a lot of community<br>since support services doesn't seem to<br>add up<br>oh there's older people in residential<br>care which from my perspective<br>geriatrician I know that probably that<br>we I know we could do better than that<br>more people come in to Edie and I know<br>this is possible to level that off if we<br>get it right a general practice<br>workforce that might decline quite<br>rapidly and I met one of the young<br>doctors and hospitals just proudly<br>announced me he's going to primary care<br>which I thought which is great news he's<br>asked me for reference so I'll be king<br>but we do need to keep recruiting into<br>that workforce um and our population is<br>changing 25% over 65 that doesn't worry<br>me actually it's the over 85 that worry<br>me<br>there's over 65 you know in ten years<br>time was is actually gonna not people<br>think it's gonna be particularly young<br>because people are healthier but it is<br>that accumulation of people in the very<br>old age group<br>that could cause major problems for us<br>if we carry on just doing things that's<br>the way we do them now if you look at<br>these these two graphs here you can see<br>the current model is is well where the<br>money goes and therefore the effort<br>because money and health is only a proxy<br>for people okay cuz 80% of the money<br>pays people just about 70 80 % so where<br>you look at money it's not dollars it's<br>people doing work and you can see though<br>that's what's happening we're<br>predominant we have a big predominance<br>of hospital and really we want to work<br>out what the opportunities are what we<br>can realize in terms of investing<br>earlier getting encounters and<br>healthcare provided early on people's<br>health course to avert some of that<br>there simplify things and leave it leave<br>us in a position where we're able to<br>respond um we do have this challenge<br>coming off building a new hospital and<br>we should not build a new hospital<br>isolation of the rest of the health<br>system is part of the health system it's<br>a tool for the health system to use it's<br>not an end in itself and therefore we<br>have to have a strategy around the whole<br>system NICU the primary community part<br>how is there going to use a hospital now<br>how do we supply it how's it gonna be<br>used for patient care and so we've got<br>we've got to invest in in the whole<br>sector and we could very easily be<br>distracted by the demands of building<br>which I think is probably the first<br>whole hospital built in New Zealand for<br>a long long time actually though it<br>could eat us if we don't have a clear<br>focus and to hold to something around<br>the really important part of the health<br>system so the strategy itself it's<br>focused obviously on our goals better<br>health better lives and empowering<br>people to live well and stay well um new<br>ways of working because we will have to<br>change the way we work and we keep on<br>saying that we haven't quite done it yet<br>you know I went upstairs in the award<br>round a general position it's kind of<br>rather similar to the one I did when I<br>was a medical student which is you know<br>a while ago so how are we gonna actually<br>work out how what we need to change when<br>we don't change that bit but what can we<br>change to make them is how can we take<br>advantage of technology so we have a<br>strategy we can<br>more like to be able to achieve that um<br>though number one patients consumers far<br>now are empowered to drive and own their<br>care and I've given you an examples if<br>we can do it for home hemodialysis we<br>can do for a lot of things if we invest<br>the time and energy and educating people<br>we want people we want the service in<br>the community to work closely together<br>in partnerships and what Doug will talk<br>more about how that's to be done um and<br>we want a good integration across<br>hospital specialist service in the<br>community so we're lined up that we know<br>who's doing what we can understand that<br>we got to health pathways put together<br>we really started to use them and so<br>equals journey becomes predictable and<br>easy I see a lot of unpredictable<br>unpredictability that you can't tell<br>what's gonna happen next the patient's<br>quite often we sort of get to the anyone<br>bitten into the next bit but how can we<br>make that a seamless simple approach and<br>when we also want to take make best use<br>of technology and I've said it and<br>that's a changing feast we don't know<br>what its gonna be<br>so I'll hand over to Doug now he's going<br>to talk more in detail about what's<br>inside a strategy and I'll come back at<br>the end around it up before we have some<br>I just stock standard primary care<br>physician and Dunedin based in the<br>Central City and the last time I spoke<br>to medical Grand Rounds was there's a<br>PTA pediatric registrar about 20 years<br>ago hopefully I'll be better today we've<br>been going through the strategy for<br>quite some time and we have done a<br>number of road shows around the around<br>the region taking our communities down<br>the pathway down the journey of what's<br>happening in terms of the primary<br>committee strategy and this lady here<br>has been introduced by Chris Fleming is<br>a lady called Margaret I'm going to talk<br>a huge amount about Margaret but I just<br>wanted you to see a picture and know<br>what she looks like she's an elderly<br>woman with multiple comorbidities in<br>anyone who's practiced any for medicine<br>for a long time will have had a patient<br>very similar to Margaret and their<br>practice and they'll be very aware of<br>the difficulties that someone like<br>Margaret and negotiating the current<br>health system right through from access<br>to their primary key imagine their yeah<br>understanding I've got what's not as<br>your father yes there's a primary key<br>always brain seek Andrew K when there's<br>a problem pacemaker<br>I've lost my track now and so so this<br>has been a way of explaining to patients<br>who could quite quickly latch on to this<br>and say yeah I've just got it I've<br>either in this situation myself<br>or I I know of a person who struggle<br>with the health system and we could<br>start to say well compared to the<br>current health system this is what your<br>experience so I'm only go to about the<br>primary key is part of the strategy not<br>just come back and talk about the second<br>Turkey response to the strategy because<br>it doesn't only involve changes in<br>primary care for this to occur so first<br>goal of the strategy is for and I've<br>been quite strong and using with<br>patients and rather than consumers but<br>to allow patients and their families and<br>their communities to be empowered to<br>drive their own care now there's a<br>number of ways you can do that and the<br>model that we're looking at using is in<br>front of you so there's three key<br>components that primary key will be<br>looking to make changes and we're<br>underway already in some of these the<br>first is the molecule<br>get home now this is not a new model<br>it's being developed in New Zealand over<br>the last few years about three years in<br>various places in the country we're<br>about two million patients involved in<br>healthcare homes around the country so<br>this is we're not the first people to do<br>this but we'll do it the Beast so what<br>does the healthcare home look like<br>essentially it's a general practice as<br>you know now but within that practice<br>there will be changes that are made<br>it's basically modernized as general<br>practice brings at them on the air it<br>brings technology into interplay and<br>opens up the whole practice to be much<br>more patient focused and much more<br>responsive to patient care there's four<br>key components the first is increasing<br>access to urgent and unplanned care for<br>that patient who rings on the day<br>currently and can't get the point with<br>the GP and ends up in the emergency<br>department but some of them comfortably<br>manage their primary care by any member<br>of the primary care team so this doesn't<br>necessarily need to be managed by the GP<br>and to do that there are some changes<br>that practices have to make to make<br>appointments of appointment availability<br>as well as increased GP phone triage<br>which is probably the biggest play in<br>the space as well as making sure that<br>patients have ring for edge and<br>appointments are seen if they need an<br>urgent appointment but if it's actually<br>more that they just want their birth<br>certificate done today instead of<br>tomorrow that they come at the<br>appropriate time and see the appropriate<br>person for that to create more space and<br>capacity for urgent things we have to<br>think about the rest of the practice so<br>the second part of this is to think<br>about proactive care for patients we<br>know patients like Margaret who's gone<br>from the screen we know that patients<br>like Margaret if we plan their care very<br>well then their need for care becomes<br>less in terms of urgent or unplanned<br>care or hospital level care so if a<br>patient like Margaret has a care plan in<br>place or advanced care planning if she<br>needs it then that can be activated very<br>quickly by providers at the right point<br>of time and we can reduce your need for<br>access to further services so we have a<br>program about - which is actually<br>started up and running called The Clique<br>programme that's fully in the care<br>planning space for patients<br>the third part of this I've got the<br>order around the wrong way on my slide<br>is about routine care for patients so if<br>we can improve their access to unplanned<br>and urgent care we can plan their<br>proactive care better then we can<br>increase capacity for just their routine<br>care in the practice and this involves<br>thinking about things differently as<br>well as Nigel's commented before if you<br>have hypertension and you can do your<br>blood pressure monitoring at home you<br>need some blood tests every now and then<br>do you need to go to your GP every three<br>months for that is you GP the right<br>piece and the practice to provide that<br>care these are the questions that<br>practices need to ask through this so<br>the patient is seen in the in the<br>appropriate time in the appropriate way<br>to give them best access for care and<br>the fourth part of the healthcare homers<br>business efficiency so there are a lot<br>of tools bring coming in so the business<br>side of general practice can be run<br>betta we know that there is a huge<br>amount of and efficiency in every<br>practice and the way we run our<br>practices what we don't know is how to<br>stop it how to change it and how it<br>affects the leak and efficiency we know<br>if we improve the efficiency of them it<br>should hopefully improve business<br>profitability but beyond that it should<br>improve access for patients to services<br>on top of those patients and some of you<br>who are patients all of you will be<br>patients will they've already noticed<br>the change in patient portals and access<br>to care through technology and a marked<br>change in the whole patient portal space<br>of what patients can do in terms of<br>their own health literacy and an access<br>to health care through electronic means<br>and surprisingly we're staying to find<br>that it's not just the Yankee's 18 year<br>old who can use that it's right up to<br>the 80 year old for our lady who wants<br>to book an appointment online we had<br>thought they would struggle so health<br>care homes are underway we've got<br>expressions of interest out right now<br>we're waiting for those to come in there<br>and from 1 July we'll start to work with<br>the first group of practices on moving<br>them towards the healthcare home model<br>big change for primary care and it was<br>going to take us some time and we keep<br>telling practices that they won't go to<br>bid 1 though there's a normal practice<br>and wake up on the next day as a health<br>care home there is a process to work<br>through for the practices and the same<br>with the entire community and primary<br>strategy is going to take some time to<br>get there and hopefully Nigel's<br>okay we'll just keep bailing that out<br>until we get get to the point a second<br>stage of the primary key strategy is<br>think of the community hub it's not<br>specifically clear to anyone as far as I<br>can tell exactly what the community<br>health care hub looks like but I've got<br>I've got some slides and why are they<br>this is the structure so a community the<br>community hub will probably almost<br>certainly contain a general practice<br>within it but not all general practices<br>will be community hubs so they will be a<br>place where a group of general practices<br>and other members of the primary care<br>team so remember general practice is not<br>the only primary care provider in their<br>community and there are lots right<br>through this area where who would be in<br>the primary care space and and there may<br>be more as time goes on as we realize<br>that some of what's provided in second<br>you care may not need a need to actually<br>be provider than seeking care going<br>forwards so when some of these services<br>will then need to be provided an a a hug<br>which almost certainly will be a<br>physical location a building where a<br>wider range of services I provide it<br>than they currently provide than the<br>standard gym or practice at the moment<br>now there are some practices already<br>doing this to a certain extent so we've<br>got a little bit not just we've got them<br>in the southern region but we've also<br>seen them around the country so we know<br>a little bit how this model works but<br>specifically well the hub will look like<br>all being like will be quite specific to<br>the location and the services that are<br>required in that location so there a<br>little bit of work to do around the hub<br>side of things but and the the primary<br>care physicians and the primary care<br>team will feed into that hub and be part<br>of that loop outside of that there's<br>this thing called locality networks and<br>locality networks this is a bit of a map<br>that is a little bit of us so far just a<br>speculative approach and we'll look how<br>the network distribution might be like<br>now if you're from any one of these<br>areas especially for some of our rural<br>spaces and you're looking at that and<br>thinking I don't think my town fits into<br>that correctly you're probably right so<br>we're still working this through at the<br>moment and there's potential changes to<br>this so I don't want you to photograph<br>that slide and take it to ADT and say<br>these guys are putting locality nitwit<br>right here<br>I don't agree because that's this is<br>really just just to give you an idea of<br>what a locality network would look like<br>so locality networks are geographical<br>locations that look across the services<br>required for that locality and say well<br>as our primary health care looked like<br>on this locality and we are pretty<br>confident that the services and the<br>structure and things that are provided<br>and one of these localities may be<br>different to the service there's that<br>need to provide a different locality if<br>you've got a very big box hospital in<br>one locality and no hospital another<br>locality your services will probably be<br>slightly different having said that<br>we're going to get a new hospital and<br>things will look different in their<br>hospital and we need to think about what<br>services are currently provided in the<br>big Hospital now that may be providing<br>the hub structure in the future so they<br>are linked to some extent so coming back<br>to Margaret what does it mean<br>so remember I've just given you the big<br>structure on what we're talking about<br>from a primary care perspective for a<br>patient that means in some instances<br>very little so for a patient who's<br>currently well with no significant<br>medical problems who attends the GP<br>every three years just to say hello<br>because they've got a cold life may not<br>be hugely different but hopefully they<br>both see their GP the same day at least<br>which may may not do now we're doing the<br>practice up north recently they had a<br>28-day wait to see their GP so<br>fortunately my practice these people on<br>the same day so come to us it's my<br>lovely advertising but it does mean that<br>the patient here will now be more<br>centered on what Margaret needs so for a<br>patient who has significant medical<br>illnesses and significant needs their<br>care will be more proactive what she<br>will have a care plan in place she'll<br>know what to do when things go wrong the<br>providers also will know what to do when<br>things aren't going well and every part<br>of illness that can be managed<br>proactively will be hopefully it means<br>fewer tests and assessments anyone who's<br>worked in the medical field for a long<br>time will know that doctors always for<br>some reason do say at the same test for<br>us later that the GP did four hours<br>before<br>because for some reason they don't<br>believe that when we took the box it was<br>different to in the specialist took the<br>box and so it has improved with health<br>clinics health and health ones are the<br>access to results as better but<br>hopefully there'll be less time because<br>the notes and everything will be more<br>accessible and more shared she'll be a<br>exclusive primary care team in different<br>ways you may exists both through<br>visiting but also through email and also<br>through phone access although phones are<br>becoming increasingly outdated as time<br>goes on but usually have better access<br>maybe different access but better access<br>we hope that akhil that as its required<br>we'll be able to provide closer to home<br>she won't have to come to the big box<br>Hospital as often and she'll see people<br>that she's much more familiar with and<br>able to talk to where they having to<br>tell the story for the 18th time because<br>the registrar's have just changed for<br>the year hopefully this will give her an<br>increased level of confidence in the<br>primary care service but also through<br>access to technology which is provided<br>through the primary care model so she<br>can get reliable access to online<br>resources she can get support groups can<br>get access to community case<br>community-based care providers more<br>access to wider range of services that<br>allow her to magic here more easily now<br>I'm going to hand over the moment but<br>that sounds a bit scary for some of the<br>road shows that sound a little bit scary<br>for some of our only patients who are<br>like well I just want it done like a<br>like like it will be for those patients<br>who don't want to do this the life can<br>go on as it is and then we're not going<br>to force people into having to make all<br>their appointments online or do<br>everything technologically but for<br>patients who are willing to take this on<br>they will get a much they will get much<br>better access to all these services and<br>I think for them it's going to make a<br>vast difference to their care I'll just<br>pull out in the meantime look um what<br>does this mean for specialist services<br>well one of the focuses is for the<br>specialist services to be<br>available when they're needed so we have<br>capacity to respond at a time is needed<br>rather than queuing and getting too<br>complex there's two parts to that the<br>one one part is the demand is getting<br>the right people to us the second is<br>what I'm gonna do about our systems and<br>I see I observe just going round the<br>place and dealing with lots of things<br>that we have a lot of variation the way<br>we do things and the patient flow is<br>never entirely visible and clear and<br>it's really quite complex sometimes lots<br>of things happening in the background<br>lots of people are having to remember<br>things are done it's a paper going back<br>and forwards that we have to be able to<br>straighten that out get some sort of<br>focus on our honest a more standardized<br>approach to things um using health<br>pathways to get the clinical bit right<br>but to get the infrastructure the<br>transactional systems all working<br>smoothly and then to work out how we do<br>that so it's visible and we're in<br>partnership with primary care team with<br>general practitioners and with community<br>services so they also can see what's<br>happening um<br>focus on focus on improving care for<br>older people that we have to undertake<br>in the hospital services you've probably<br>seen that thing called n PJ paralysis if<br>you haven't I would encourage you to<br>look at it sounds very trendy what does<br>it mean it means that older people<br>shouldn't be in bed in hospital simple<br>as that if they're in bed they're<br>getting worse sometimes people need a<br>bed in hospital it's actually quite<br>limited obviously you need one intensive<br>care so sick you can't get out of bed<br>that's not everyone in the hospital and<br>probably a small proportion and you need<br>one to sleep in otherwise you need to<br>start changing our way of looking at<br>enable meant in hospital so we have a<br>hospital that can meet the demand for<br>acute things and also specialist<br>services things that can't be done<br>anywhere else and that's what we want we<br>should be focusing on you think when<br>you're looking at strategy like this you<br>might think it's a bit ambitious<br>you know we're just you know to pie in<br>the sky well you people here will have<br>heard of the cleveland clinic in the<br>states one of one of the most successful<br>heart institutes it maybe doesn't bit<br>too much heart stuff that's another<br>story but one of the most successful<br>institutes that they started with with<br>with this sort of belief of what they<br>call appreciative inquiry which was<br>looking at their successes<br>successes there are lots of things we've<br>got successes we have great primary care<br>great general practitioners we have<br>great Hospital specialists and services<br>we have really good environment to work<br>in and some great community services how<br>do we take advantage of that in order<br>and then priests acquire model is you<br>look at what you're doing well and then<br>you start having some big dreams and<br>then you focus on those in your hold to<br>those and you think that's too ambitious<br>but that's what enabled the cleveland<br>clinic to be successful and lots of<br>other institutions have used similar<br>model so the idea of thinking you know<br>to substantially change things is valid<br>and well worthwhile in a health system<br>um we do need this this technology<br>infrastructure and I won't worked on too<br>much but I can see substantive changes<br>from my perspective every patient should<br>be able to be able to read their whole<br>health record I don't see why they can't<br>I can't see the obstruction you know<br>it's the last private thing left you<br>know they can read the medical textbook<br>so I couldn't do a few years ago but<br>Michael why can't I read my own record<br>it I can't find a good reason why I<br>can't be my own record and if you<br>haven't started realizing action start<br>realizing now start writing stuff for<br>the patient to read<br>very wise physician said that to me as a<br>medical student as always make sure you<br>write for the patient to read which I've<br>always done you need to be in that frame<br>um<br>the technology will build technology<br>into the new hospital lots of exciting<br>opportunities we tend to be frustrated<br>by today's technology if we could<br>deliver today standard of technology in<br>ten years time the hospital we lower it<br>a long way further forward there was in<br>10 years time with his liver was 10 good<br>ten years ago we'll be miles ahead of<br>where we are now but I think we can do<br>even better than that to join things up<br>and it gets easier every day to do it<br>technically it's just a matter of<br>commitment um so we go then start about<br>how we're going to shape our secondary<br>care response to work with us and when<br>we find ways to partner with primary<br>care the coordinate the follow-up of<br>patients when we know what needs to be<br>done the regular basis rather than<br>having to come back to the clinic and we<br>can see what's done on a regular basis<br>using technology so there are things to<br>do to me this is really exciting to have<br>coordinated way forward as Doug<br>indicated though we're having<br>expressions of interest around<br>healthcare homes consultations around<br>how the localities have put together I<br>don't think they'll have boundaries I<br>think they'll be general areas because<br>once a boundary someone do a line<br>download the street we don't want that<br>we want a general principle and<br>flexibility and more needs analysis we<br>struggle a Newseum with health needs<br>analysis to really know what the needs<br>of people are it's quite hard to do<br>because how do you find out what<br>people's health needs are until they<br>actually access a health care service<br>that's a health care service assessment<br>we need a health needs assessment if we<br>can do more on that and local work about<br>how to organize services when would be<br>round talking about this to local areas<br>they really do have a good understanding<br>of how they could shape things much<br>better and they're caught up in the way<br>we think should be things should be done<br>that sort of centralist view and they've<br>got much better ideas than we have this<br>is about actually helping people<br>actually undertake and execute their<br>ideas as they know what their local<br>community is like we don't know um<br>making sure we get those models of care<br>right and done even possible I talked<br>about um health pathways I think is a<br>really important tool for two reasons<br>secondly because it gives us a health<br>pathway we can follow and see what<br>clinically should happen but firstly the<br>development of health pathway should be<br>a communication between the hospital<br>special services and primary care and<br>that communication creates team you can<br>spend time with people you understand<br>their perspective and the other bit you<br>don't know about well good I don't know<br>the details are working in primary care<br>so I have to listen to people who do<br>that every day um and we want to<br>continually review and evaluate what<br>we're doing so we I think we're in a<br>really exciting time we do want feedback<br>and continuous feedback not you know<br>sort of mammoth dates where things have<br>to be in by but continuous feedback and<br>we want where we want to redesign things<br>we want to make this what's co.design<br>sounds a trendy word what it really<br>means is the people involved are in the<br>room and that's everyone and that<br>includes<br>the patients that's really important so<br>if you think about redesigning a service<br>I know those services a successful done<br>this to get the patients in the room<br>you'll find you've got a wise group they<br>give you a new perspective that's what<br>the strategy is will happily answer<br>questions anything you like they'll be<br>the reverse Duggan<br>these are myself on the front here and I<br>have a microphone here for anyone who<br>wants to ask a question or answer a<br>different question I'll tell you about<br>the strategy for the national electronic<br>health record which is not to give you<br>an application that you log into but to<br>develop a shared data set that will be<br>live or people so my data will be<br>available in a shared data set that's a<br>substrate and if I agree it's freely<br>available every point of care to be used<br>by the applications you already have<br>okay so my blood pressures are in one<br>place and then if your system in the<br>general practice once that blood<br>pressures it looks at my blood pressures<br>from that so we have one source of the<br>truth which of course is the most<br>fundamental part of integrating when we<br>will have shared care plans well we do<br>have a health connect sound now the<br>technology to put together shared care<br>plans which is already happening in some<br>parts of the south and I hope this year<br>will build start putting some stuff<br>together what this is cow Ford from well<br>south who's there they're a real ITX but<br>yeah there's two parts that sort of the<br>acute care plans for people who<br>currently need acute care which is they<br>will want to target and the second was<br>what's called advanced care plans which<br>means care plans for you saw their<br>end-of-life stuff and then people are<br>Bale to work with them on their primary<br>care practitioner gap loaded into the<br>system and be available every point of<br>care right well it's happening already<br>patients with copd mr. yes do it yeah<br>Jake and I are looking at each other are<br>the hospital on the primary Chia system<br>and even within the hospital from people<br>I know worked on on these projects so if<br>I move to white amantha for example<br>there's my electronic record easily<br>transferred to this system no no so<br>whatever is in as I've said to the team<br>who have been working on on the model of<br>the shared record we've got coastal<br>South Island host our founders covered<br>is we've got to get the landing craft<br>organized to invade the North Island<br>really part of it will happen through<br>that shared data set so your data will<br>become available to why Dermott are not<br>happening yet out of it will happen<br>because what I'm actually working with<br>in the Auckland region how are they<br>going to structure themselves and we'll<br>definitely make sure we get a connection<br>between the two but it's not happening<br>right now you'll and I'm very frustrated<br>um I just wanted nothing to perhaps<br>reflects a bit on some of them think key<br>conceptual drivers are in these livery<br>drivers for what you're doing last<br>question around that one of the key<br>drivers for what we're doing here<br>regionally internationally as much<br>mobility okay that was implicit in a lot<br>of what you were saying okay but what<br>you're saying was around mobility as it<br>applies to older Picon that's clearly a<br>need to address but we are I think<br>increasing gains have to focus on mental<br>ability across the lifecycle but the<br>beauty of best people and deprived areas<br>younger and in particularly physical<br>incremental health care entities<br>increasing problem in younger groups and<br>I think that I think is a springboard to<br>my question really which is that linking<br>when I'm just said conceptually with<br>both developments here clearly mental<br>health and primary care are both very<br>high on the agenda for discover Minaya<br>Giannini is is can you say anything<br>about about how you intend to you just<br>model specifically to improving<br>integrate mental health services<br>particularly within primary care as<br>suspect that is probably an area that we<br>will need to look at particularly in the<br>context of morbidity I've got a bigger<br>answer the line item I think the first<br>paper question is about is this just for<br>the elderly but the what we use in terms<br>of the proactive care is a<br>stratification model<br>so essentially you stratify your<br>patients regardless of age for their<br>comorbidities and give them a<br>essentially a number that is this<br>person's high-risk versus this business<br>is my risk and then you provide care to<br>a patient in the high-risk group and<br>that's regardless of age but of course<br>if you're older you're a hybrid your<br>risk goes up because of our age alone so<br>in terms of just straight yeah who is<br>this for anybody's who's high risk or<br>high needs and would fit into that scope<br>in terms of the mental health side of<br>things that's a that's a space that's<br>not clearly<br>elicitor than the strategy as a as a<br>specific space but it's we would agree<br>with you and and the government's<br>clearly got that and going through a<br>mental health review at the moments a<br>government level to assist that it's and<br>it's clear that not nationwide we're not<br>doing well enough in the mental health<br>space and we need to look at where that<br>key is provider desert and the community<br>is it within is it is it well provided<br>than the seeking good care service at<br>the moment what can provide them the<br>primary care service what can provide it<br>outside of general practice in the<br>community and therefore had we fund it<br>and that process is ongoing but the<br>basic model and structure that we have<br>in the primary strategy allows us to<br>tweak into that appropriate spaces the<br>risk the challenge of mental health as<br>well where it becomes X Direction<br>parallel primary care you get this Gulf<br>people are getting maybe expert mental<br>health care next but finally health care<br>but they're not joined up so however<br>that if you look at the networking<br>structure for localities and the hubs is<br>every opportunity to bring that together<br>as part of our response to the mental<br>health review so we've designed I think<br>the right substrate with some research<br>we've done with a summer student in high<br>needs practices the the amount of mental<br>health and physical ability in patients<br>is extremely high and we need to have<br>the services that the patients need not<br>necessarily I think well an existing<br>necessarily think that existing ways we<br>can figure those services important and<br>that is very much the emphasis on<br>research aren't done here with<br>colleagues and little mobility we need<br>service redesign you've made a really<br>good point and a mental health in some<br>ways sits that straddles sort of a<br>stratification and I think you know<br>particular and adolescence where we're<br>seeing a big increase in mental health<br>then I think that we certainly to a lot<br>more communication<br>mental health services and primary care<br>I think that's pretty fundamental and<br>looking at different models of how<br>adolescent Zach actually accessed here<br>is important so I think it it doesn't<br>quite fit in this strategy to some<br>extent but I think the empowerment's of<br>practice is understanding their mental<br>health issues amongst their population I<br>think this this format gives the the the<br>methodology if you like for influencing<br>that communication well I was just gonna<br>make the comment that there is no health<br>without mental health and well-being and<br>this is a fantastic opportunity to<br>reconnect physical health and mental<br>health because so much if you have<br>physical comorbidities how well you<br>manage that is really strongly<br>influenced by you mental health or you<br>know lack of mental health so to<br>separate them as a to me a nonsense and<br>we must put them back together again and<br>it's easy much easy to do that in the<br>primary care space and the challenges<br>with how physical health and mental<br>health at the secondary level integrates<br>so currently in primary care obviously a<br>job no doctor is paid to see a patient<br>for 15 minutes now somebody who's a<br>mental health issue as well as all the<br>other things that is going on with them<br>15 minutes is woefully inadequate to see<br>them so this whole process is designed<br>to free up capacity in time with in<br>general practice so that you're using<br>the whole team rather than focusing on<br>one member of the team to generate the<br>revenue to keep the business going so I<br>think that's possible I think that's one<br>of the really key things I talked at GP<br>a few months ago and she said what about<br>my you know I have patients who come in<br>here they've from south D they they've<br>taken a long time to get comfortable<br>coming to and when they come and see me<br>they want to spend half an hour now that<br>means I slow down for everybody else who<br>comes to see me so how can i free up my<br>time to see those sorts of patients and<br>that's what this model that's<br>experienced elsewhere in New Zealand and<br>that's what we<br>to do logistic well is to give more to<br>the patients and to free the practice<br>from the tyranny of the 15 minute<br>consultation<br>okay it doesn't directly influence the<br>solar surging then it might work on the<br>margins where we can support primary<br>care to provide office space procedures<br>no quick we can have trained general<br>practitioners in the hub's to do things<br>if we want but not for the seriousness<br>all is how does it help well if we can<br>manage the overall use of the across<br>pidor for acute services for older<br>people and and stem the growth we've got<br>capacity because well it doesn't give<br>you new theatres I agree<br>okay I've got a build a new hospital for<br>that or find alternatives in the<br>meantime when I say you've got capacity<br>we have to then reshuffle our workforce<br>because in the hospital resources people<br>you know along with the important issues<br>like theatres this strategy in itself<br>will not give you new theatres but it<br>does give us opportunities for the<br>future because if we leave things as<br>they are our will be more and more and<br>more difficulties it gives us an<br>opportunity to reshape ourselves to deal<br>with this and also to get a better<br>understanding about relationship and<br>primary care about the needs of those<br>people that we don't even get to see<br>that we all hear about we don't quite<br>sure what how we're gonna meet their<br>needs will have a better a better<br>relationship better day accept better<br>understanding so it doesn't solve the<br>problem but it gives us some<br>opportunities to address it I think um<br>yeah I think that's partly true but I<br>think look if you need to hip replaced<br>and you can't walk in you're almost in a<br>wheelchair you need that done in the<br>second rehab care hospital whatever and<br>this is a primary community strategy so<br>it's not trying to fix that that problem<br>and you may well need a secondary care<br>access to elective surgery strategy to<br>solve that problem but I think if you<br>said to yourself what percentage of<br>patients turn up on my outpatient<br>first specialist appointment clinic that<br>don't really need to be seen by me and<br>then maybe that's a space we can work in<br>so if only be senior patients don't go<br>on to have surgery and they should never<br>have got there then this strategy can be<br>in that space to improve at least that<br>level of access yeah exactly right I<br>mean we all need self but you know we<br>know that patients who get good<br>physiotherapy in the community with<br>their house or us may well delay the<br>surgery quite significantly so<br>potentially that's a moose the the<br>bottleneck a little bit I'd just like to<br>highlight and the need to revise and<br>revisited things on a regular basis so<br>we know we're heading in the right<br>direction and we know that we are<br>achieving what we're actually trying to<br>achieve so I think alongside the use of<br>technology we actually have to recreate<br>some of the data that we collect to<br>actually critically evaluate what we're<br>doing because I think traditionally in<br>the health sector the data sets have all<br>been isolated in particular silos and<br>everything so I think alongside this<br>particular strategy we need to actually<br>re-evaluate what particular data we<br>collect and for the success of this and<br>I just wanted to highlight the plight<br>possibly of those that aren't actually<br>involved in general practice and I think<br>they are a significant number within our<br>community and and I think probably they<br>are they are possibly the most socially<br>disadvantaged on our population and<br>actually probably contains some of the<br>most severe comorbidity data I'm pretty<br>important and we have a lot of data we<br>just don't work out how to use it best<br>if we have a strategy and we hold to the<br>goals will begin to because quite often<br>you know people put Studies on the shelf<br>we want this to be a strategy where you<br>hold to the goals and then and then we<br>can use data we've got the best data for<br>managing health care systems is the data<br>that's collected in the process of care<br>as<br>the most accurate and calmly data so our<br>goal will be to use that as best we can<br>as we develop that that shared data set<br>along with primary community and Carol<br>and I've had discussions about how to do<br>that then we can get a much better<br>visibility of how well we're doing or<br>otherwise where the problems and issues<br>are and we can also find our successes<br>because I know in this sort of endeavor<br>if we find success and and can make it<br>known and realize we can achieve things<br>it creates the opportunity for more<br>because you less people lose heart and<br>more people think actually something can<br>improve and leadership they've shown to<br>date just to please get to stay involved<br>get involved this is now a system-wide<br>approach really end and is really the<br>vehicle for integration across our<br>system so please don't be you know kind<br>of fooled into thinking that this is<br>just about climbing community because<br>absolutely as the book showed in Nigel's<br>slide we need to grow this boat together<br>so just yeah thanks for your interest</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
