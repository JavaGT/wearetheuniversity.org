accurate.</p><p>so we're all faced with the issue of<br>culture and how we can come to terms<br>with our history and move on and design<br>for all cultures in New Zealand so first<br>of all how do we deal with<br>decolonization first of all I think you<br>need to know who you are who you are<br>personally now you've heard from Andrew<br>some of the highlights or lowlights of<br>my life but something I also should make<br>clear is that I've got both English and<br>Scottish and Marty ancestry<br>so William Swanson whose name appears<br>and swats and Lane and swats and Street<br>and the suburbs further out and Oakland<br>was one of my great great grandfather's<br>and his wife was Marty and he ran a tune<br>or I started off not being aware of that<br>at all and so more and more I'm<br>beginning to find that actually I<br>identify more and more with my Marty<br>links but of course on both so so first<br>of all we start with a Papa so<br>for me that is called hedonic e2 manga<br>go talkie-talkie to our core takitimu to<br>Walker called magical nunu to e we call<br>nutty the tree Appetit to her food nor<br>porky who for Diane means<br>talking line so for those of you who<br>find that new just to explain and it is<br>important for what I'm going to say<br>later the mountain for me the important<br>mountain for naughty Kahu nunu in this<br>case is kare dinah key the mountain is a<br>symbol of impermanence of longevity and<br>so on and the water the stream the river<br>is tookie-tookie which again is very<br>symbolic in that it stands for the life<br>blood the flows the the purity and the<br>importance for people and of course for<br>all life and the Walker connects me and<br>others who are from Cathy nunu with<br>other tribes that came to New Zealand on<br>particular canoes and I was born in<br>Topanga Nui are Tata<br>Warnecke Wellington so that's a<br>description of who I am the most<br>important thing about that is that the<br>mountain the river are all much more<br>important than I am so your name is said<br>last<br>now first of all I'd like to tell you a<br>story and this is a story that is about<br>culture and it is about sensitivity and<br>it's about people and in Auckland I'm a<br>member of a small group of grannies who<br>every three months have a meeting on<br>karana karana is the calling the<br>ceremonial calling and I might not be<br>very good at it but we learn we have a<br>lot of fun and do a number of activities<br>this is the story of going to the beach<br>last year to point ship we didn't get<br>there as early as we planned<br>it was meant to be a dawn greeting to<br>the waters of the white Ameth Matar but<br>we arrived a bit later it's also a story<br>so the karana ladies we're walking into<br>the sea and gradually the tide went down<br>and we swam and we thoroughly soaked<br>ourselves and enjoyed the beach in<br>November and then one of our members<br>heard some others and by that stage the<br>beach was fairly crowded and kids were<br>in swimming and the Sun was shining one<br>of the members heard a group of people<br>arriving and we're talking about what<br>they would do they had wasted 18 years<br>to take the ashes of Nana Florence from<br>New Plymouth to where she wanted to be<br>left at Point shared because in her<br>childhood she had a wonderful time<br>wonderful memories the point share Beach<br>as a child and so we wondered what would<br>happen and our fire<br>carvanha person had a word to the family<br>and explained that right behind the<br>beach with the beautiful - whoo - comet<br>reinfect several and just as she was<br>pointing it out a whole lot of wood<br>pigeons flew out of the tree and so we<br>suggest what if Nana Flo's dishes would<br>put under the tree instead of in the<br>beach where everybody was swimming and<br>the family thought that was a good idea<br>as well and we took Nana flow up to<br>underneath the tree and we sang a hymn<br>and we had a prayer and the ashes were<br>scattered and a few days later one of<br>our group who took care of the Pearl<br>Harbor keiki at Unitec came and planted<br>young flex flowers around the bottom of<br>the tree so that addressed a subject<br>that was difficult to us very difficult<br>to the family they were in tears when<br>they arrived they didn't know quite what<br>to do and how to do it and some might<br>say well there's quite a lot of<br>pollution in the sea anyway and doesn't<br>matter to me it mattered maybe to others<br>as well and so that was a way of moving<br>together and finding a outcome that<br>everybody could live with the family<br>could live with as well and they<br>departed looking much happier than they<br>had when they arrived so the story of<br>Nana Florence is one of in our tombs and<br>I think in their tombs as well<br>compassion and understanding and having<br>but that wasn't the only thing that<br>happened on this very same day many<br>other things happened we went up to<br>white uh Curry's we went up to the dock<br>is that a Hut it's not a hat it's a<br>information center designed by Harry<br>turbot there that sits beautifully into<br>the forest and from there we heard from<br>the veranda down to the dam who knew a<br>dam that's down below and we thought we<br>saw the dam responding and the water<br>rippling with the sounds the vibrations<br>and we went into the forest as well in<br>the white a Curry's and did the same<br>thing and again we felt that the birds<br>were responding some of the others who<br>were tourists who arriving may not have<br>understood what was happening but I<br>guess the message that I want to leave<br>with you from this is that we need to be<br>sensitive to cultural values and when<br>we're living in a city where we're<br>living close together we need to try<br>very hard to understand those that we're<br>living with we may not understand but we<br>oops I did say was the technophobe there<br>we go<br>so before we discuss decolonization I<br>think we really need to look at so what<br>is colonization what's it all about<br>why is it of any moment at all in New<br>Zealand I was told by somebody that I've<br>got to tell a story and I've got to tell<br>a joke so before I get started on the<br>more serious subject of colonization I<br>was reminded when Andrew asked me how<br>long this talk was going to take that<br>I'd heard a similar talk from Rodney<br>Hide who was a politician if you<br>remember him in Auckland it was also a<br>lecturer at Lincoln University and he<br>started off one of his very first<br>lecture by nervously tapping his papers<br>talking very fast getting through to the<br>end of his lecture notes and looking<br>around desperately and disappearing out<br>the door and he stayed there because he<br>discovered it was the broom cupboard he<br>stayed there for about five minutes<br>hoping that everybody had gone he had<br>gone and then came out again and there<br>they all we're looking here convenient<br>was a broom cupboard as well what do you<br>do so he went through his whole thing<br>again only your lever more slowly so I'm<br>hoping I'm not going to be doing what<br>Rodney Hide did but and I know it's<br>locked as well I've already tried that<br>to see if there's an escape route so<br>back to the more serious topic of<br>culture a country a state colonizers a<br>space we'll probably know if we read<br>left in that school or learnt about<br>Roman history that when they colonized<br>and they did a lot of that in Europe<br>they invaded but when British came to<br>New Zealand they thought that nobody<br>actually lived there their reports were<br>it was called in a lessened term terra<br>nullius nobody lives here there were<br>comments that there were savages here<br>but they weren't counted as people and<br>the other things that are commonly<br>undertaken our place named substitution<br>one of my colleagues who came from<br>Israel said that was done we in<br>Palestine was part of it was given to<br>Israelis and Israeli names were placed<br>over Palestinian names locations were<br>changed local people are driven out<br>indigenous are driven out colonial<br>knowledge and values are substituted so<br>the place becomes a colony of those that<br>have that culture and others in an<br>busiest position of needing to change or<br>not layout of towns and cities is<br>imposed according to those two colonial<br>values so an example perhaps<br>is that certainly cultures become<br>disconnected in a place like this it's<br>very likely that communities are<br>disconnected as well but that is the<br>consequence the grid layout of the<br>European city in fact years of European<br>cities but also transported by Spain to<br>Latin America and South America with P<br>axis of course instead of some of the<br>designs that we have but we can we see<br>that in New Zealand well I heard that<br>Masonboro is designed the road layout<br>and the shape of the Union J now what<br>could be clearer than that<br>there are lots of different examples the<br>Roman roads straight because they were<br>built for armies to walk along so<br>straight and flat Wellington where I was<br>born was designed in the UK and so they<br>went aware of the topography they didn't<br>take into account the different latitude<br>in the south and so the houses often<br>faced the wrong way but they were<br>designed for Sun and a different<br>direction and there are roads that<br>actually go nowhere because the<br>topography is too steep so they turn<br>into pathways up the hill you will know<br>so a colonization commenced but what<br>about the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840<br>well it was signed the original<br>instigation was so that the<br>administering authorities would have the<br>power to deal with the debauchery that<br>was happening in Russell at the time the<br>sailors drunken sailors but afterwards<br>as howdy Williams has told me while the<br>British betrayed Marty since the signing<br>of the Treaty there are indications that<br>equality is beginning to take shape but<br>what I strongly recommend to you if you<br>have not had much on the treaty and<br>don't know very much about New Zealand's<br>early history<br>what about reading that sometime Ellie's<br>book the Great War for New Zealand break<br>read strongly recommend it but just<br>another point on so what happened next<br>in 1870 there was a native lands fraud<br>prevention bill most interesting name<br>and the purpose of that was to bring the<br>lands of North Island which belong to<br>the Marty's into a purchase system so<br>that that everybody could proceed with<br>colonization this is what the Minister<br>of Justice said about it and the other<br>great object was the tribal ization<br>destroy the principle of communism which<br>ran through the whole of Marty<br>institutions oops that's automatically<br>changing not I can't read fast enough<br>maybe I need a maybe I need a boy to do<br>first of all yet to allow access to land<br>to address the tribal ization and<br>finally to try to bring about<br>assimilation that was the purpose of one<br>of these laws and thank you too now I<br>hold is nothing a solemn for these<br>slides so what are these strategies<br>these colonization strategies well there<br>was introduction of subdivision British<br>land laws British lands system Marty<br>didn't have ownership of land at all it<br>was it was not owned but it was their<br>community so a recent innovation maybe<br>you've heard about it is to do with - hi<br>We're - era is now not owned by anybody<br>go to where that owns itself and I'm<br>hopeful that others take opportunities<br>like that so Dee tribal ization land<br>confiscation British law Broughton was<br>there assimilation perhaps but I've been<br>working with Ellie Murray recently and<br>some of the consequences are still<br>reverberating for instance the native<br>Schools Act<br>Maori language forbidden in schools from<br>1867 onwards and that was policed<br>in education very severely so the Maori<br>language could not be spoken on schools<br>and often parents took the view that it<br>was better to encourage their children<br>to speak English then Marty and so some<br>of the very old Marty now aren't able to<br>speak Maori and it's a it's a<br>a pain a sorrow for them Anna Tara's<br>healing the tumor suppression 8 1907 to<br>replace traditional healing with modern<br>medicine and that traditional healing<br>such as use of herbal remedies like Rama<br>one still use today but at that time a<br>lot of the knowledge was lost through<br>the suppression of Tehama so what<br>remains today is very very precious and<br>knowledge of use of plants New Zealand<br>native plants for healing so have an<br>idea of what might be done as far as<br>colonization so it's all about culture<br>and management and power and justice and<br>so on what about decolonization well<br>here's some ideas what could we possibly<br>do and I think you probably have a bit<br>much better ideas and I have first of<br>all it's a knowing who we are and where<br>we've come from because on the basis of<br>that we make all sorts of assumptions<br>and respecting different cultures and<br>values and their languages as the rugby<br>commentator drew our attention to in the<br>hero and what about our identify to<br>these diverse identities and proud of<br>them and the range of them rather than<br>entertainment is the rugby guy also<br>mentioned so we need to question<br>assumptions we need to work with<br>communities share resources<br>and there should be a place for all in<br>our cities so in summary the<br>decolonization and Adamo did ask what<br>what I was thinking of it's actually<br>about social justice and fairness that's<br>all I'm talking about so what about<br>disciplines and by disciplines I mean<br>architecture landscape architecture<br>engineering design disciplines there are<br>of course others design are they<br>colonized as well well I think so<br>because a number of them use European<br>knowledge solely based on so how can we<br>profession of landscape architecture is<br>possibly hit Swiss and others because<br>land is intricately bound into landscape<br>architecture and there's a number of<br>terms that are not simply terms used in<br>other cultures<br>for instance landscape that's a cultural<br>construct that is it's relevant to a<br>particular culture maybe many cultures<br>but in this case European cultures it<br>doesn't exist in Middle Eastern cultures<br>if you talk to somebody from Iran about<br>landscape it isn't a word that they use<br>and it's not a word that came from came<br>from indigenous cultures either there<br>isn't a word landscape in martí language<br>even though somebody did discover that<br>it has made it to the online dictionary<br>powder but it wasn't used in the past<br>so cultures change language changes and<br>we need to accept that that's exactly<br>what happens but recognize that if we're<br>dealing with cultural constructs there<br>are particular ways of thinking<br>that leads us to nature's a cultural<br>construct I don't know whether people<br>had understood that as well so Chinese<br>will think about nature and a different<br>way to First Nations and Canada in a<br>different way from those who might be in<br>Latin America sort of is a different way<br>that's a cultural construct even though<br>you might be able to measure the leaves<br>of a tree and so on professional<br>knowledge for landscape architects comes<br>from the West and cultural knowledge as<br>well from the west and there amidst so<br>it's very difficult for landscape<br>architects and and many have struggled<br>with it to tease out what are the values<br>the value propositions that come with<br>the culture and what is this the skill<br>they're learning the professional<br>expertise that we're live learning at<br>the same time and I know architects are<br>looking at that others are looking and<br>have dealt with it but it's not easy<br>so taking us as a proposition I was in<br>the lucky position in that as I traveled<br>to a lot of countries and so I thought I<br>wonder if this really is true or just in<br>some of our minds how does it all work<br>out so I spoke to Russians about it at a<br>conference I spoke to Japanese and<br>Chinese about it and also in Middle East<br>and how they faced it how did different<br>cultures face it those from China had<br>had a difficult time because they had<br>welcomed a whole lot of difference<br>beliefs helped cultural values and song<br>that had come from the West and they<br>were finding that their own cultures<br>knowledge was being undervalued that<br>began to change particularly young<br>students were objecting highly to what<br>about our own culture and gradually now<br>China instead of assuming that a<br>landscape architect from Canada or<br>America Europe must be better than their<br>own knowledge they are changing and<br>remembering that they've got 6,000 years<br>maybe more of landscape understanding<br>nature understanding planning cities<br>even understanding and that they should<br>go back to their own ecology their own<br>culture and work with that instead and<br>they instead ideas repositioning some of<br>the old values like Feng Shui is an<br>ecological philosophy instead so can be<br>done in different ways of thinking Japan<br>had just ignored that the values that<br>had come from the West and so carried on<br>they had been designing as well Gardens<br>and cities for thousands of years so<br>simply let it wash past so can deal with<br>us in various ways but how in New<br>Zealand can landscape architects deal<br>with it well Maori landscape architect's<br>they looked at a lot of the expressions<br>a lot of the principles and so on and<br>gradually a way forward was worked out<br>but initially the barrier was do you do<br>a checklist how do you move from<br>principles that are important for any<br>culture to what actually happens on the<br>ground how do you apply different<br>but what seemed very clear for landscape<br>architecture for others is it's about<br>developing relationships recognizing and<br>responding to man Afeni that is the<br>people whose authority whose respect<br>whose roots with a particular area it's<br>about social justice and so on and<br>another story a one of our speakers that<br>a conference just recently from<br>Australia was explaining how difficult<br>it was in Australia to contact their<br>local indigenous people he happened to<br>be from Melbourne which is in Aboriginal<br>tunes City the place that's not so<br>happen that although he said he'd been<br>unable to contact anyone to get some<br>feedback on a particular design he was<br>working on there was somebody from there<br>Everage not from the very place sitting<br>in the audience they hadn't been talked<br>to but anyway<br>his view was that it was difficult in<br>Australia but New Zealanders were doing<br>it very well that Landscape Architects<br>in New Zealand and New Zealand culture<br>generally seem to be doing a whole lot<br>better seem to understand the culture a<br>whole lot better and I was surprised<br>that people clicked because are we<br>really is that what we want to believe<br>are we are we in that position where we<br>can collect ourselves I really don't<br>so what sort of things have been done<br>well last year dr. Betty tittle and<br>Victoria University had this idea that<br>they would have a competition and UNESCO<br>provided funding for it and they worked<br>with the use of nasty Toa rangatira<br>in plural and had a competition on<br>imagining decolonized cities they had<br>two different sites and Peru a large<br>scale a small scale and had those<br>students and practitioners submit<br>entries but that was for me the first<br>time I grappled with so what is a<br>decolonized city how do you go about it<br>and what were the entries looking at an<br>in their view he colonized cities are<br>cities that are equitable places for all<br>far no for all families reflecting Maori<br>values in identity so it was the her<br>ruler identity that was important for<br>Marty as well as other New Zealanders<br>and the ideas that came from that for<br>indigenous that was in place and they<br>wanted to see recognition of note local<br>names local narratives their<br>environmental values because Pororo<br>Harbour is not in the great shape in<br>their waterways and their cultural<br>landscapes and these were the ideas that<br>were iterated was a group of hamato who<br>was talking with for a research project<br>on Monday<br>they too would like to see for a city do<br>something about that they said it hasn't<br>happened yet that they are wanting more<br>and more but they were still swinging<br>Pearl Harbor despite the despite the<br>pollution and they had many happy<br>memories from the<br>childhood of doing just that as well and<br>collecting shellfish from round about<br>the the edge of the harbor so those are<br>the memories that people hold but does<br>it take place today so next one I<br>thought why don't we have a student<br>design charrette with New Zealand<br>Institute of landscape architects<br>conference but my hope was to have many<br>different universities taking part not<br>solely landscape architect's so that<br>this would be something where we could<br>all work together students work together<br>from different different ideas different<br>universities different disciplines and<br>the project site was on a killer Terra<br>Hobsonville point which has really been<br>partly developed nearly fully and to<br>look at what does it mean to design in a<br>colonized land to colonize the city in<br>the end we had about eight different<br>education providers taking part we had<br>38 students brave students we had a PhD<br>student in working on decolonizing<br>design we had planning students from<br>Otago we had Landscape Architects from<br>Lincoln we had students from Victoria<br>University from Messer University and we<br>had one brave thank you Auckland<br>University we had one brave architecture<br>student as well from here so those<br>students were really challenged to look<br>at their assumptions and see what it was<br>that they what were their hopes but what<br>were other people's hopes as well when<br>they looked at how they might go about<br>design<br>and we were asking them to look at it<br>from a Marty lens as well so the<br>Charette took place at two novel<br>Kotahitanga we had the full support of<br>fire Linda and just Aranui and Howe who<br>explains at night in the photo nuit what<br>the what the poem eat around the edge<br>and that actually is a full history<br>lesson of ancient tribal links of<br>papa<br>in other words genealogy but it also<br>includes the changes that are happening<br>in New Zealand and the changes that<br>happened in Auckland and right up to the<br>end of the end wall you can see is about<br>development and about the volcanoes and<br>so on in Auckland so the students learnt<br>about living together which was a first<br>for many of them at the same time we had<br>lecturers who were from berlin dom ninja<br>this is from indigenous australian also<br>now she put over on my way he knew night<br>ahoo and car who knew new different<br>range of marty information to present to<br>them they think that we were most<br>drummers about was that we didn't have<br>mana fennel in there<br>I don't know whether the word manaphy<br>Noah is a new one for you but it means<br>the people of the land and the people of<br>substantial point which we are<br>kado Mackey and nutty fast worth TK pada<br>and neither of them were either to be<br>they're able to be there I quite<br>understand they were booked for months<br>ahead and we only changed to this site<br>in the last couple of weeks before we<br>held the meeting because of changes that<br>were happening in the other sites that<br>we had initially so they couldn't be<br>there and students needed to understand<br>how would be if they were seeking<br>consultation from Mona anyway how they<br>might gain the understanding of their<br>values and what was important to them<br>about the site also what is a colonized<br>City how might you go about decolonizing<br>it and so what were the value<br>propositions that they were working with<br>and again this is an awful slide a about<br>design material design which is<br>transient and including Maori values<br>with it to reinforce identity that's<br>about identity for those who are in a<br>colonized place so for any of you who<br>have taken trips with students this is<br>the get on the bus to go out to the area<br>they have the walk to go around the site<br>and then do the work one thing that a<br>student should read a Sharif is a<br>project that happens very quickly and I<br>think probably all of you know why Tasha<br>readers anyway but just in case some of<br>the culture of sure it's is it that you<br>do it overnight you work all the way<br>through the night but I'm not as<br>flexible as some and don't encourage<br>working until the presentation<br>is done by those who are standing<br>sleeping so they were back in the mud I<br>by 9:30 at night in the in their beds<br>and working again the next time I didn't<br>ever see a student with a cell phone out<br>during the day while I was with they<br>were working so I think it was a success<br>so because I should be the outcome is<br>not so much what is the great design<br>because it's not going to be necessarily<br>very brilliant after only a limited time<br>working on it it's the learning about<br>the topic and learning to work together<br>in a multi University multidisciplinary<br>group and so the presentations took part<br>the students listened intently the one<br>with the poncho on is the PhD in working<br>on design so she had different things to<br>share with the student from architecture<br>in Oakland and the Lincoln University<br>students and some layouts were produced<br>and some different ideas came forward<br>that talked of galleries and sharing of<br>food and ways that might bring the new<br>community at Hobsonville together with<br>the those that were there in the past<br>and not living there now we did ask how<br>many Marty where<br>living that they're not there yet so<br>using different knowledge as well this<br>is the 30 day madam Atticus cycle so<br>part of culture is knowledge this is<br>trying to use other sorts of knowledge<br>in what has been produced and what was<br>produced they looked at the multiple<br>histories of place Mari<br>airforce homes and it was for the<br>officers at Hobsonville point for the<br>Air Force Base next door and now of<br>course the new settlement and new<br>communities use of food learning art<br>galleries as tools and materials local<br>materials that were being used and could<br>be reused as well so what's another<br>example that was one that was already<br>worked on but Glen Innes is going<br>through a process of change at the<br>moment as well and I've been working on<br>a project they're looking at<br>neighborhood in place and just recently<br>the local community held a project<br>called home fires which involved local<br>use from Tamaki College and those<br>families and those that were sitting<br>living in the middle of a neighborhood<br>under bath change concrete mixes were<br>going down the road regularly it was the<br>noise of power saws and drills and<br>everything and dust and dozers and<br>diggers and everything else while people<br>were living there very difficult<br>situation and it was being imposed on<br>the community or that's what many felt<br>so the tamaki college students were<br>asked to paint this wall about what they<br>would like to see what it was they're<br>desirable<br>sebu Bingley<br>what would they like it to be and then<br>over the top of that how they felt it<br>was now and so you didn't actually see<br>what was their dreams what their dreams<br>were that was underneath because instead<br>what you saw were the words that they<br>felt at the time which are words like<br>fear and anger and hurt so that is what<br>happens when vast change happens to<br>people that perhaps are powerless to do<br>anything else and is there a place for<br>the former residents of Glen Innes is it<br>being just gentrified so that other<br>people are living there and can those<br>were there who are Pacifica Marti<br>largest communities previously and also<br>Burmese and other new residents it's a<br>replace for them and Glen Innes or will<br>they be moved out to the outer suburbs<br>through inability to be able to pay the<br>cost of housing and places like Glen<br>Innes and I've recently looked to a book<br>that you're probably well aware of boo<br>Tina Watson and Bentley that talks about<br>place identity and what we need to do to<br>acknowledge histories and also recognize<br>non-human aspects which of course over<br>the trees the environment the water<br>which muddy community are very anxious<br>about the quality of the water that goes<br>into the three harbors so Glen Innes is<br>still proceeding but what do elderly<br>Marty's say about decolonization and<br>design and in the work that I've been<br>doing<br>we had several comments one was that the<br>land was so important in terms of<br>well-being for them and for their health<br>the health of the people but it wasn't<br>and is there evidence that there's true<br>application of Marty badges and<br>recreation areas they didn't think so<br>they thought that they've become<br>stagnant and stale and this was talking<br>about Auckland the first was talking<br>about elsewhere and they thought that<br>the open space should be green and<br>vibrant with a rich combination of<br>cultural elements as well so the places<br>should have meaning not only for<br>Europeans for others but also for Marty<br>so that they're inclusive spaces so<br>whatever pun helps all been doing well<br>one of the things that they've<br>introduced principals tearing up design<br>principles which originally came through<br>novel but have been adopted by the<br>Auckland design office and being worked<br>with mine offending work so that they're<br>grounded in Auckland with mine have been<br>work rather than simply a set of<br>principles that have come from elsewhere<br>and that's what needs to happen so I'm<br>this is cut straight from the ATO<br>website as you might recognize so I urge<br>you to go and look at the Turanga design<br>principles and work through them rather<br>than me so they've given you a list of<br>them but the important part of it is<br>that you're intended to explain how<br>these principles can be applied on the<br>so some final words but before I come to<br>there I had discussion with the<br>colleagues that I was working with last<br>week and when said this and I wanted you<br>colonization impacts are evident<br>throughout the urban fabric of our<br>cities be it in the language of our<br>wayfinding and signage the built forms<br>that tower through our cities the<br>narrative in the landscape and the<br>collective identity of the public realm<br>many of our cities could be anywhere in<br>Europe and this contributes to the<br>identity crisis our city has okay not<br>only for Marty but for all New<br>Zealanders and of course if you go<br>overseas you can follow plants that you<br>find everywhere you can look at high<br>streets that have the same Starbucks<br>same shoe shop same everything you can<br>walk down the street and wonder we you<br>are so where is identity there's an<br>international identity an international<br>plant palette that is high-street<br>everywhere but on a spectrum of how far<br>position we are as a society towards<br>either a city planned on your eccentric<br>worldviews at the one end or a city<br>planned on Maori world views at the<br>other end our cities look feel represent<br>in Elena's terms 90% you're a citric<br>planning appearance and function no one<br>is saying that we want to be 90 percent<br>on the other direction well yet but we<br>need to start to shift further along the<br>line towards a 50/50 point so we need to<br>respect each other and find different<br>ways of designing the design professions<br>are being pushed further in<br>further to recognize equitable design<br>for people of all abilities you can look<br>at cultural design and decolonization in<br>the same way because we're largely<br>looking at equality and equity so as<br>well as being accessible for wheelchairs<br>what about accessible for all cultures<br>if our public realm wayfinding and<br>signage is now going to be in Braille<br>shouldn't it also be into their mighty<br>language it would be if it was in Wales<br>in Welsh if we're considering how public<br>buildings are accessed and used by<br>people in wheelchairs or with visual<br>impairment shouldn't we be looking at<br>how they can be used for cultural<br>purposes such as poor hoodie or cui and<br>shouldn't we be to be designing homes<br>and spaces for Marty as well as so final<br>word from here was recognition that the<br>cultural overlay doesn't work for<br>everybody all places or pockets of<br>society so why don't we start stripping<br>back our cities to provide more<br>culturally conscious police making that<br>allows us to as we always say see our<br>we seem to be resistant to<br>decolonization it's difficult people<br>have been talking about it for a while<br>we're not doing it<br>so can we change what is it that is<br>difficult is social equity a discipline<br>hope our connections to place through<br>stories names culture do they assist in<br>city design and identity and we need to<br>design with humility and respect for<br>homes and communities and cities not<br>houses houses instead of homes so<br>acknowledgement of those that<br>contributed to this photo honey we thank<br>you and I before I finish I wanted to<br>thank you very much for a couple of<br>accelerating change like these are I<br>think 30 years from now when we kind of<br>look back what do you think will be the<br>kind of key the most important things<br>that are happening at the moment what's<br>the really critical changes that we're<br>even making or trying to make I've heard<br>lots of people say and this has been<br>through a long time we're at the<br>crossroads we've been at the crossroads<br>different crossroads lots of times I<br>don't think we are really there but not<br>happening in Auckland is a lot of<br>building I'm hoping that when we start<br>some of the building and there's going<br>to be four thousand houses for instance<br>built the government announced in the<br>Unitec campus on the balance of the<br>unity chemist land I'm hoping that we<br>will recognize the natural area that we<br>have there many native trees there and<br>the special spiritual water that is<br>there and the harder kicky the special<br>flex areas and so on in other words I'm<br>hoping that it all might be much more<br>jointly with community with my tea<br>values as well as other values rather<br>than just a rush to build houses as<br>quickly as we can and as slowly as you<br>can it's not necessarily the density of<br>course it's the quality and what we<br>think about and so I hope there'll be<br>more partnership with local monofin over<br>there so that it is as an example of<br>other developments<br>is done jointly so that people have<br>places that they can identify with<br>rather than simply more houses but of<br>I see it about this it it is about<br>social justice</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
