cultivation that has contributed to the successful development of Silo Park, with a user-centric focus at its core.<br><br>Frith is a passionate exponent of the importance of healthy public spaces in the advancement of liveable cities, and as Auckland continues on its path to becoming a 'big city', consideration has to be given to human investment and the creation of a sense of wellbeing and welcome within densely populated areas.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi everyone I just want to say thank you<br>so much for coming along to tonight's<br>fast forward lecture series my many zoo<br>from the Faculty of creative arts and<br>industry here at the University of<br>Auckland this evening I have the<br>pleasure of introducing Fred Walker who<br>is an inspirational lady and as the<br>manager of placemaking at Panico<br>development Auckland with Fred's<br>leadership and vision we have had the<br>pleasure of experiencing the<br>transformation of public spaces on the<br>Auckland City waterfront such as a<br>much-loved silo park not only has it<br>been an active space for public art in<br>programming to connect with local<br>communities it has also been a source of<br>immense pride as a key attraction for<br>our international visitors to enjoy and<br>of course share on Instagram more<br>importantly froth upholds the value of<br>yet another Herto not a hit a litter and<br>it's clear that putting people at the<br>heart of place is at the center of every<br>action and decision she takes to make<br>Auckland a city desired by many I can<br>continue fangirling forth but I also<br>like the opportunity to thank our<br>generous sponsor Jeff for making it<br>possible to offer yet another fantastic<br>fast food series and this time convened<br>by my colleague Andrew berry from school<br>of architecture and planning so to thank<br>house sponsor I'm just going to play a<br>for over 100 years gypsum plasterboard<br>has been used as internal wall lining<br>all over the world and for over 85 years<br>when stone wall boards limited as<br>manufactured millions of square meters<br>of its to plaster board right here in<br>New Zealand at its plants an Auckland at<br>Christchurch<br>when stone wall boards limited produces<br>a range of plaster boards standard fire<br>resistant water resistant noise<br>controlling structural bracing impact<br>resistant and even x-ray shielding all<br>conforming to strict New Zealand and<br>international standards the Auckland<br>plant also manufactures a wide range of<br>seating and air drying compounds to join<br>and finish to plaster boards and prepare<br>them for decoration gypsum is one of the<br>most common minerals of the world<br>usually derived from the salt content of<br>seawater the gypsum used to make Jim<br>plaster board is sourced from natural<br>deposits formed from centuries of<br>evaporating saltwater Lakes gypsum is a<br>compostable non-toxic material that's<br>used as an organic soil conditioner as<br>well as being the safe and sustainable<br>winstone wall boards manufactures a wide<br>range of commercial lengths of standard<br>and specialty boards custom lengths of<br>popular plaster boards between the 2<br>point 4 and 6 meters are available for<br>orders over 100 sheets house lot orders<br>are popular and modern residential<br>construction saving time and money at<br>the building site as well as plaster to<br>be made into plaster board winstone wall<br>boards manufactures a range of compounds<br>for jointing first of all additives are<br>mixed in with the plaster - about the<br>properties required for

of a literature<br>or for a no-obligation chat with the jib<br>technical advisors about your particular<br>thank you again Jeff I'll sponsor so<br>thank you very much many and I can say<br>it's entirely mutual in terms of<br>fangirling good evening ladies gentlemen<br>it's a really great privilege to be here<br>tonight and I always get slightly<br>freaked out in a lecture theatre feeling<br>like a lecturer when I spend a little<br>bit of time as a student so I will try<br>not to bounce around because I need to<br>speak into the mic for the sake of the<br>lovely people out there in the universe<br>I'm gonna start with a disclaimer I<br>started trying to make this presentation<br>and couldn't do it and couldn't do it<br>and couldn't do it and I realized that's<br>because I'm terribly angry right now<br>this is a piece by Jenny Holzer which<br>sort of summed it up for me in terms of<br>this feeling that I have that something<br>is not right and it's time for us to<br>rethink how we do things and Jenny<br>Holzer is saying it far more eloquently<br>than me but it felt honest to say that<br>to you<br>that I'm starting from a position of a<br>little bit cross so rather than my<br>lovely a few serve warm I am really just<br>so pleased to talk about my job I'm<br>coming from a different place tonight<br>which is actually quite exciting but<br>yeah I kind of work for Auckland Council<br>I work for Panico development Auckland<br>who are one of the council controlled<br>organisations and so tonight I'm sort of<br>speaking like froth maybe more than a<br>Pinocchio development employee and I<br>pretty sure I can't see any of my bosses<br>in the audience so I might just say what<br>I want to say which is freeing for you<br>guys um I think on a really bad day<br>council feels like Vogons and I'm<br>realizing that not everybody here grew<br>up with her Tucker's guide because some<br>of you were born like way after me but<br>there's a Skitch and Hitchhiker's Guide<br>to the galaxy we the Vogon race come to<br>put a superhighway through where it sits<br>and there's quite a funny when you don't<br>wait for council sketch about the Vogons<br>saying I'm sorry human race the plans<br>have been available on you and your<br>local alpha Centuri office for the last<br>10,000 millennia and the human race go<br>you never told us that you were putting<br>a highway through and<br>Vogons go well it's in the wrong so<br>there's no sorry and then they'd like so<br>occasionally in a council meeting where<br>we're talking about doing something to<br>come you are community I'm hearing this<br>speech and it's maybe not Vogons and<br>it's maybe not earth being blown up but<br>it's still I'm sorry it's in the rules<br>and we said we talked to you and this is<br>the way it is so this is where I'm<br>starting from it's it's it's it's not<br>always a good day but I wasn't always a<br>council employee um I started working in<br>theater and I at the very beginning I<br>thought I was going to be an actor and<br>then somebody said hey firth why don't<br>you go backstage and so being a stage<br>manager and get off and so I was a stage<br>manager for a very long time and then I<br>turned into a theatre producer which<br>kind of is what saw me into the role<br>down and for the waterfront this is me<br>for the lowest one hundred and fiftieth<br>birthday party and on this particular<br>night kelly rowland didn't turn up to<br>rehearsals so I had to be Kelly Rowland<br>and really it's a really it was a really<br>acute and visceral lesson and humility<br>and I'm a very good stage manager but<br>I'm not a very good dancer and and these<br>two these are some of the most patient<br>gentlemen that I've ever met in my life<br>but it was a good reminder and in terms<br>of I'm good at some things and these<br>guys were good at others and we'll stick<br>to what we do and then they'll be a<br>great show as a result onto pond okay<br>this is sort of the fine print and and<br>in 2011 we had Waterfront Auckland and<br>Auckland Council property limited and<br>waterfront Auckland had the mandate to<br>redevelop the wenyard quarter and land<br>ownership that sort of stretches from<br>Harbour Bridge Park and West Haven<br>marina right through a little teal Park<br>down as part of ports and Auckland<br>Council property limited managers<br>Auckland Council's non-service portfolio<br>so that's not train stations and not<br>parks but it's all the weird berms and<br>forests and quarries and bits of<br>business all over Auckland sorry that<br>council owns so looking at what had been<br>achieved in the waterfront and looking<br>at kind of the might of ownership that a<br>Cpl held they brought us together to<br>create something that is our first chief<br>executive said should be two plus two<br>equals seven so the Mojo of water for an<br>Auckland plus the might of a CPL should<br>be able to bring development to greater<br>parts of Auckland so we're now working<br>in a series of development areas across<br>the city the big red dots mean<br>transforming okay<br>which is 20 years with a quite<br>significant change across a quite a<br>large project area little yellow dots<br>probably mean one site that might be<br>redeveloped or it might be sold on to a<br>developer under some conditions and the<br>blue site sits somewhere in between we<br>were working within a project area over<br>probably a five to ten year period<br>working on change that will hopefully be<br>catalytic for that area and our name<br>pond oku was gifted to us by our manaphy<br>know a working group by one of the local<br>a we specifically for the word pond oku<br>which means to move forward and together<br>and it talks about the building of a<br>walker and how a walker is a very<br>difficult beast to maneuver it has very<br>little free board and it takes an awful<br>lot of teamwork to make it go forwards<br>and not sink so it's a very powerful<br>word for us to hold and I think the fact<br>that it also talks about forward<br>momentum is good for a council<br>department our job is to get on with<br>some things so I've mentioned the one<br>you headquarter a couple of times this<br>photo is actually from about 2008 so you<br>can see our lovely team New Zealand<br>shared still in place and our fish<br>market which is there and a lot of these<br>things that cars important and then sort<br>of a lot of industrial areas and then<br>fleshing forward to 2011 actually in<br>2017 this new thing that we have down<br>here was a lot of public space a lot of<br>people and a lot of smiling people which<br>is probably the thing I like the most<br>about it would a friend Auckland<br>deliberately chose to lead with the<br>public space put the public space and<br>first and then the development will<br>follow and that maths has worked and as<br>you can see down there now there are a<br>lot of apartments and commercial<br>buildings and what-have-you popping up<br>all off the catalytic effect of opening<br>up that Jellico precinct so really early<br>on they identified that if you built a<br>lovely new piece of public space and it<br>hasn't got any people in it that's<br>probably not so good so they bought in<br>placemaking as one of the key strategies<br>Stuart Niven is one of our sort of<br>godlike creatures in terms of urban<br>design he's a Melbournians New Zealander<br>and I like to quote him all the time<br>because I found girl him all the time as<br>well but he's one of the chaps that has<br>taught me kind of how to do the job for<br>the waterfront placemaking is this<br>notoriously difficult thing to define<br>and there isn't really a path a<br>definition but where I like this one it<br>talks about the fact that we're working<br>together and it's focusing on public<br>realm it doesn't use the word community<br>community can be a bit blinking for some<br>people but this idea that we're talking<br>about relationships for the sake of the<br>environments that we're building and it<br>starts back in about the 1950s and 60s<br>with William white and New York who is<br>going around with a super 8 camera and<br>recording how people are behaving in<br>public space and this is from a movie<br>called the social life of small urban<br>spaces and it's a must watch I think and<br>yeah if you put a seat and people are<br>probably sit there if it's sunny people<br>will probably be there have its Shady<br>they might move away these kind of<br>pretty pragmatic statements but that<br>there's so much evidence out there of<br>places that were built without people in<br>mind that William White's work suddenly<br>started to become very important and<br>then the woman I want to grow I be when<br>I grow up<br>don't Jacobs who worked really hard to<br>maintain sense of community in New York<br>up against the people who were trying to<br>smash motorways through those weak<br>communities Fred Kent who's just<br>stepping down as the boss of project for<br>public spaces trained underneath William<br>white and he's really the chat and his<br>son Ethan that's sort of where we go if<br>we want some what are we doing here we<br>look at PBS's website so there's a very<br>short lineage of place makers here but<br>incredible Giants to be standing on the<br>shoulders of this diagram I find really<br>hard to explain but when I think about<br>it and in fact actually when when PBS<br>first made it it was just these sort of<br>middle four nodes and then it started to<br>sprout petals and over the last six or<br>seven years it sprouted more and more<br>petals but when you think about it we're<br>trying to make spaces that are good for<br>human beings and human beings are<br>inherently more complex than this so it<br>goes some way to capturing all the sorts<br>of things we're factoring in as place<br>makers in terms of what makes me feel<br>good as a human being but I'm going to<br>rant on slightly more about that later<br>on just as by way of an example in case<br>you don't know it this is Detroit in the<br>nineteen seventies kind of the poster<br>child for urban decay and America and if<br>you keep your eye on that thing<br>well-designed for the dominant species<br>on earth the motorcar and a city and all<br>sorts of state of badness in terms of<br>major infrastructure falling over quite<br>bad quite bad government stuff going on<br>as we understood and<br>yeah a lot of people moving out and a<br>lot of a lot of blight PPS went into<br>that same space use your little statue a<br>sculpture took out quite a lot of lanes<br>of traffic added a public space brought<br>the community into program met public<br>space and it is now a major node for<br>downtown Detroit there's an awful lot of<br>investment moving and alongside it<br>there's an awful lot of people moving<br>into the town center as a result and<br>there's way less murders which is<br>probably the most important piece of<br>data this diagram was pretty much the<br>only instruction I was given in terms of<br>how to run the waterfront but again a<br>Stewart Nevin Koch because I want him to<br>think I'm cool but it sort of talks<br>about how we use our keys public spaces<br>in the waterfront and thinking about how<br>the energy might flow through so when<br>you're in gateway or Cardona Plaza as<br>it's known now it's kind of a gentle<br>space contemplative you can go and sort<br>of find your bearings there as you move<br>through North Wharf and the food<br>offering the energy kind of steps up to<br>Delacroix Plaza and then if we want to<br>put on Metallica we'll probably do that<br>at silo Park but that was all we were<br>given we weren't given a set of KPIs we<br>weren't given a list of instructions we<br>were given this diagram and the<br>instruction make people like it please<br>for us and that was it so that was a<br>marvelously free space to work in and<br>we've got William white and Fred Kent<br>and Jane Jacobs and Stewart Nevin and<br>all these great people sort of talking<br>about how public space should happen in<br>a city and then we get this waterfront<br>to play with which was pretty exciting<br>and it's a waterfront based on some<br>pretty meaty design ethos ethos sorry<br>this is straight out of our urban design<br>framework and as you can see would have<br>been quite tricky to run the silo type<br>we run today if it was under water so<br>I'm pleased that they changed that<br>decision-making but we've got these<br>major axes running through the space<br>that we still pay attention to so the<br>east-west axis being the most important<br>we keep that view shaft open no matter<br>what the north-south axis that you can<br>see doggy Street linear park which will<br>lead to our future headland Park at some<br>point and then this blue axis which kind<br>of runs along the length of one you know<br>dwarf the reason that they're doing this<br>sort of stuff is because of how we move<br>as humans through space so this idea<br>that if you can see a hundred metres<br>ahead of you you feel quite safe putting<br>in landmarks to make sure that humans<br>could locate themselves through the<br>space all of this DNA was being put into<br>the area long before it opened by a very<br>very clever set of design<br>and three kind of major leading themes<br>for us in terms of thinking about<br>placement design thinking about who<br>might use the space and why and so it<br>was recognized that Auckland has a lot<br>of university students here are some of<br>them living in may be high-rise<br>apartments maybe with not much outside<br>space to play in and so we added the<br>half court and the half courts used all<br>the time by people from all over<br>Auckland all times of the day and night<br>this is the development site so it<br>potentially might turn into something<br>else but this was a kind of a long-term<br>intervention with the court put and<br>specifically to attract people<br>the second stuff is a staff aspect to<br>more about Ana second but maybe the<br>stuff we're most well-known for this<br>idea of putting in a signature program<br>to make sure this new hundred and twenty<br>four million dollar redevelopment was<br>valuable to the people of Auckland and<br>their visitors and then the staff where<br>we kind of muck around with people's<br>heads so doing stuff in the corners that<br>might make people stop and have a look<br>putting things and that might surprise<br>people or make them think twice this<br>photo looks really cute but it doesn't<br>sound cute at all there's there's<br>there's wonderful children bashing out<br>chopsticks and then there's sort of<br>people with sheet music who clearly<br>don't have a piano in their apartment<br>coming down and playing amazing pieces<br>and then other people who turn up and<br>play things they made up themselves the<br>piano now lives in a container on Dottie<br>Street and it doesn't have a security<br>guard it is locked up overnight but it<br>just does its own thing and it's always<br>a surprise to walk past and see somebody<br>with their skateboard propped against<br>the piano or six security guards playing<br>pieces to each other or whatever's going<br>on there and people are just using it of<br>their own accord so this kind of idea of<br>activation is really about giving people<br>a reason to be in place and then have<br>interactions with each other this is<br>maybe the bit that makes me cross this<br>idea that the way that we do so we've<br>going to plan a public space okay we're<br>gonna need a public space so let's we're<br>going to plan a public space so let's<br>make the budget right and then we'll do<br>a design we've done a design we've got a<br>consult is everybody call that wearing a<br>public space great come again okay and<br>then we build it and then we deliver it<br>in yay we're done and we leave that's<br>great but it doesn't make for resilience<br>it doesn't make for relationship<br>building and it certainly doesn't make<br>for an ongoing sense of checking on a<br>space and so placing community driven<br>kind of implies this other way we are<br>popping the human beings at the very top<br>of the process you're actually taking<br>some time to experiment and then you're<br>certainly taking some time to watch and<br>see how it's working before you maybe<br>make major investment into a place this<br>is the kind of approach that PBS are<br>championing and it doesn't seem to be<br>going away it's it's how we we approach<br>the waterfront in spaces like way to<br>Matar Plaza which I'll talk about and it<br>makes a lot of logical sense especially<br>when money's tight and the benefits are<br>really exponential and you know I<br>promise I'll get on a soapbox later on<br>but if we're not building places that<br>help us be better citizens if we're not<br>building places that help us talk to<br>each other better as citizens of a city<br>then I think we're doing our job Ryan<br>especially as a council Department we<br>have 10 principles for placemaking like<br>I said there's no instructions but we've<br>kind of written down a set of things<br>that guide us so for thoughts are really<br>important one and I've talked a little<br>bit about it but it's going back into<br>those fundamentals of what is a space<br>you know what is what is this place and<br>why are we working here and what should<br>it be and what are the one of the things<br>one of the truths of this place in<br>thinking about stuff like those major<br>axes thinking about how people are going<br>to move through the space what's going<br>to draw them there what's going to keep<br>them there where they're going to spend<br>their money where might they live and<br>then making decisions like you know what<br>a half courts a good idea and then<br>popping it in spending a bit of time to<br>get to know your place this is this is<br>an example for you so back over to West<br>Haven marina but first step is also take<br>a helicopter view and go physically what<br>does the space look like so in West<br>Haven we have these one two three four<br>five six major nodes we've got Harbour<br>Bridge Park we've got kind of the major<br>pier whether you were on easier than<br>Yacht Squadron is we've got the lovely<br>new place where the promenade is which<br>is platform why don't think of this we<br>got some Mary's baby we've got zp and<br>we've got little Siloam arena out there<br>so you can steep us to think about who's<br>there who are the people that live in<br>this place who are the people that move<br>through this place every day to other<br>people that love this place who are the<br>people that earn their living off it so<br>you spend a lot of time spying and then<br>once you've made that list you can go<br>okay well who isn't here who are we not<br>seeing and why aren't we seeing those<br>people and is there a problem are they<br>are there some groups that should be<br>here that aren't why aren't they coming<br>and then you can take all of that<br>information<br>put it into a potential response so we<br>come back to West Haven and we go okay<br>so we've recognized that there's an<br>awful lot of dog walkers but there's<br>absolutely no infrastructure for dogs or<br>we've got a lot of mainly dads coming<br>down to run their boats but their kids<br>aren't coming to watch them do the races<br>every Wednesday and Friday night so<br>could we do some activations that help<br>the kids come down we now have a regular<br>thing which is called a car boot sale or<br>indeed a car boat sale where all of the<br>botys come in and sell this secondhand<br>gear out of the back of their cars of a<br>Wednesday and there's a little economy<br>starting up there so all of the<br>programming is bespoke for this space<br>and for the people of that space and<br>then the but that's probably the most<br>important right now in my head is this<br>idea of do loon do or later quicker<br>cheaper as PPS would call it this is<br>white scimitar Plaza I think it's in<br>about 1980 100 1990 pretty amazing I<br>mean gosh look at that Wow so many<br>people and a bit of good public art<br>Phillip price it's specifically designed<br>to keep skateboarders out and<br>specifically designed for events what<br>you can't see is just off to this side<br>is a whole bunch of apartments who hate<br>noise so basically you couldn't use the<br>space you couldn't do anything in the<br>space that the locals didn't want to see<br>an event on the space for you're enough<br>they're trying to sleep and the event<br>industry didn't really want to use the<br>space because the surface is really<br>tricky and incredibly expensive if you<br>break it so we have a medium budget to<br>do some redevelopment on this space but<br>rather than just going we've made up two<br>designs which one do you like we went in<br>and we started spying on the space and<br>observations were made over a really<br>long time about how people used it and<br>we started talking to everybody in the<br>area about what they space what they<br>thought this space should be you know<br>what should it feel like what kind of<br>activity do you think should be there<br>and we went back in and we responded so<br>first and foremost it was noted that a<br>lot of people cut straight through the<br>space so we laid out a red carpet for<br>them secondly a lot of people said it<br>should be an urban beach so that rather<br>than spending all of the budget on<br>putting in an urban beach we spent a<br>tiny bit of the budget on a temporary<br>urban beach and first complaint was from<br>these boaties that they were getting<br>sand on their boats which would confused<br>us slightly they stopped complaining<br>when they realized how many ladies were<br>maybe sunbathing and<br>second thing is it was really useful for<br>dog walkers which was great for the dogs<br>not so great for the cleaning crew so<br>over a period of about a month we<br>learned that the beach was a good idea<br>but it didn't really work from a<br>maintenance perspective it wasn't that<br>beloved by the locals and so we didn't<br>do a permanent beach the second idea was<br>around decaying kind of a wooden hard<br>stand space and the third idea was green<br>so we had two other temporary<br>interventions to see just put them out<br>there low-cost to see how they operated<br>and we end up with this space which is<br>kind of a combination of the green and<br>the wood and it still maintains the red<br>carpet walk and it also has a beautiful<br>piece by year behind minute now and<br>we've had one complaint from a local<br>through a four month construction period<br>we mainly were getting contacted by the<br>locals saying we're so excited we're<br>really looking forward to this space<br>coming and now it's used by an awful lot<br>of people including me that's my<br>favorite tree to sit under and there's a<br>lot of children rolling down the hill<br>and an awful lot of people taking photos<br>this man's name is Hylton he's the<br>project manager who built it this has<br>also been built by safe hands who care<br>about the space so a really interesting<br>story and hang on a second if you<br>include all of the really really<br>high-powered people that live around a<br>space and the making of it not only will<br>they have a bit of journey and they'll<br>walk away happier with the outcome but<br>you'll get a bit of space because you've<br>had more eyes on it and people who know<br>it we came into thinking about the<br>waterfront as a series of event spaces<br>so you can see good old silo Park down<br>here and we kind of have the Halsey<br>Wharf area and cutting a Plaza and being<br>Queens Wharf and that's why time at our<br>plazas I was just talking about and we<br>were planning for these guys where we<br>were coming online and 2011 was the<br>first World Cup now hands up if you were<br>here for opening night World Cup I was<br>sick and most successful experience of<br>my professional life first most<br>stressful experience finals night awful<br>a lot of people down on the waterfront<br>really really glad that Richie won would<br>have been kind of stink if they hadn't<br>but we were coming at the space thinking<br>about fanzones we were thinking about<br>spaces where we could cram a lot of<br>people in and give them a lot of<br>Heineken so they could watch the game<br>and then go home and that was a product<br>right you're making a thing watch the<br>game go home<br>and it was a pretty spectacular seven<br>weeks but a really really different<br>mindset to thinking about a place like a<br>place maker would this was just event<br>programming and so we came out of that<br>seven weeks looking at silo park really<br>differently we started to think about<br>how we could make people not just come<br>and have a transactional experience but<br>actually walk away a little bit changed<br>and come and develop a relationship with<br>the place not just the program that we<br>were putting on and so really really<br>impacted our thinking not the least of<br>which because we were just really tired<br>and we were never going to sell Heineken<br>again but we wanted to make a place that<br>actually people could have a<br>relationship with so that's kind of how<br>we went into silo party at the end of<br>2011 and I see don't talk about stuff<br>that you don't get to see on Instagram<br>so I just want to kind of tell you some<br>of the backstory and some of the cute<br>stuff that I really liked and I know<br>you're not supposed to have favorites<br>but silo coke really is the favorite my<br>favorite place to work for this is the<br>first time I ever took a photo of<br>somebody else's children I don't know<br>who the parent was I just creepily<br>turned up and took a photo of these kids<br>and it was the I think it was the first<br>time I've ever tries to put out just<br>chairs just chucked out some deep chairs<br>and suddenly these children turned up<br>and set and had a nice Block in them and<br>I got a heck of a fright I suddenly had<br>this lesson and what William white had<br>said on their super 8 tape if you give<br>people a place to sit they'll sit and<br>the parent didn't think I was too creepy<br>so that was quite useful but and that<br>was about how many people were in Sylar<br>Park in the early days of us operating<br>it so it was good that I wasn't judged<br>on audience attendance in the early days<br>this is actually an artist's impression<br>from one of the early plans back in 2008<br>it's always quite exciting when stuff<br>actually turns out you know like it was<br>drawn but this I have to acknowledge a<br>chap called Chris Molly Hall who was the<br>creative producer before me and he had<br>this vision for the waterfront as an<br>event space and a friendly event space<br>that was easy to use but this idea that<br>the waterfront had been locked off to<br>Aucklanders right we had this red fence<br>up and that was a and so the opening up<br>of the 1-yard quarter was an opportunity<br>to come and touch the water and kind of<br>have a relationship and that somebody<br>said it was the first piece of public<br>open space given to the Auckland public<br>since Sir John Logan cable<br>he's like older than me so you know<br>that's ages ago and this idea that we're<br>making a working waterfront so we<br>we're going to acknowledge the fishing<br>fleet so we're going to acknowledge the<br>work bike so we're going to make them a<br>hero shot this is a terrible sorry I'd<br>rip this out of a terribly ancient<br>document so it's impossible to read but<br>you can just start to see a new thinking<br>about this kind of linear approach and<br>the you know here's silo parked down<br>here and we've got silo six which we'll<br>talk about in all these other spaces<br>none of this was publicly accessible<br>before 2011 it was all industrial space<br>you'd go buy fish get out again and this<br>is silo park on the first day I miss it<br>so there's a bit there's a bit of our<br>design coming in with with the tram<br>checks being kept in and the rain<br>gardens starting to go in the day before<br>we opened we were sort of or two days<br>before we were going up to the project<br>managers going excuse me I've got to put<br>a band there on Saturday when pivot-hole<br>felt the kind of effort to get silo park<br>and the whole quarter actually opened<br>for the sex of August 2011 was<br>phenomenal and superhuman but um yeah<br>sort of nightmare stage where the dreams<br>of this of the stage not being ready<br>suddenly were true in front of me with<br>massive piles of concrete anyway um in<br>the very early days it was Auckland<br>Council that said cake silo 6 this is an<br>important landmark for the city a huge<br>amount of the concrete that built saw<br>well Auckland came through these silos<br>and very late in the piece like really<br>late in the piece waterfront Auckland<br>chose to keep silo 7 so that's why we<br>have so low Park ironically I used to<br>run an organization called solo theater<br>which was deeply confusing coming down<br>here for the audience but everyone<br>there's actually silos that's why it's<br>called soul attack we run an organized<br>thing called a place tag so there's some<br>thinking going on with another group of<br>clever people that is about how the<br>place feels so all of this is back in<br>two thousand and eight nine and ten<br>who's going to come to the space and why<br>what's it gonna feel like what goes on<br>what are the locals gonna feel how we're<br>thinking about sustainability are we<br>thinking about accessibility and<br>affordability but a lot of feeling talk<br>so it's not just about the drawings and<br>the engineering it's about how the<br>humans are going to respond to the space<br>and that spits out ideas for programming<br>and potential interventions into the<br>public space and built form some of this<br>list we've done CEO drinks Wynyard<br>corner is actually a dreadful thing to<br>put up as the first thing on the list I<br>realise now in hindsight let's move on<br>from that slide<br>and this is from one of the earliest<br>strategies that was written by Chris but<br>you can sort of see his thinking about<br>this challenging way about how this<br>waterfront is going to be run it's not<br>just going to be we'll do fashion week<br>and then we'll do the Boat Show and then<br>we'll have a music concert he was<br>thinking about how to get the creative<br>sectors in in a way that would challenge<br>them and make them push us further so it<br>wasn't just simply about transactional<br>audience numbers or any of that stuff<br>this was about taking a jewel in the<br>crown for Auckland and getting the<br>creative sectors to make it even better<br>than we could ever imagine<br>so all of these words that Chris later<br>and still guide us today and the next<br>bit is to make it easy to use<br>so in silo park we have a really great<br>array of powers distribution and water<br>distribution we've made a set of traffic<br>management plans so if you want to come<br>and shut the roads it's easy to do it<br>we've got a global resource consent so<br>most people don't have to get a resource<br>consent which burns up tens of thousands<br>of dollars we've got safety management<br>plans in house so for a little<br>organisers it's actually really simple<br>to use the park we don't put people<br>through the usual council rigmarole no<br>offence Council and silo six it's just a<br>very great privilege to get to work with<br>that be new it was actually my<br>great-grandfather that built it for<br>concrete so sometimes I think he's<br>looking down on me going what are you<br>doing put not in there but um it's a<br>beautiful space Bob Harvey described it<br>as an industrial Cathedral and again<br>Chris's vision is that it can be a venue<br>for actual silo breaking if you see what<br>he did there but inside the venue's all<br>interconnected so we we try to use it<br>for people who are doing collaborations<br>or progressive artworks or things that<br>will really challenge an audience and<br>move a conversation on and it's pretty<br>much used all year round so again this<br>document was written in about 2009 but<br>this opportunity to use an industrial<br>space for creativity as just cracking if<br>that's not a reason to get up in the<br>morning I don't know what is and there's<br>are so many photos of stuff that's<br>happened in there but I picked my most<br>recent one which was last night somehow<br>they managed to get a grand piano into<br>those things and as part of the Orkin<br>festival a lovely gentleman played a<br>piano inside one of the silos that<br>doesn't have a hopper which has the most<br>incredible acoustics so it was a very<br>strange experience of being in the silos<br>with maybe a hundred people all in a<br>very strange creative space which is<br>again a great privilege moving over to<br>the open space and silo park Chris had<br>this vision that we should be doing<br>movie<br>we should be doing music on a fairly<br>regular basis and we should have markets<br>now we did try music it didn't work so<br>now and the spirit of do learn do we we<br>gave it a go for about a year and<br>recognize that there isn't really an<br>interest in having music down at the<br>waterfront on a regular basis so we now<br>do monthly larger concerts or gigs and<br>but we still do silo cinema every Friday<br>night through summer and it's really<br>cool it's it's Simon who runs it<br>describes that has been like in<br>someone's lounge but you know this 4,000<br>people there but that's born of an awful<br>lot of deep thinking and part of that<br>deep thinking is the structures in which<br>the gig happens so these beautiful ten<br>structures which we now get a gift to<br>our programming in Monaco I designed<br>with an awful lot of deep thinking<br>behind them so they went to think about<br>gurnard wings and what works as a market<br>structure but also a lot of sail motif<br>and looked at the urban design<br>principles for the whole quarter and<br>went away and had a big think and so<br>come back with all of this deep kind of<br>creative inspiration and then work<br>through a pretty heavy-duty engineering<br>process with sail makers because we get<br>a lot of wind down in Soho Park and use<br>material that is honoring the marine<br>industry as well as being sustainable<br>and end up with something that is quite<br>flexible relatively easy to put up and<br>up dunes award-winning thank you very<br>much so yeah pretty special structures<br>that are sort of iconic in their own<br>right now and work in a kind of cute so<br>that's called deep thinking deep<br>thinking behind this stuff you know you<br>don't make a painting without quite a<br>lot of deep thinking and quite a lot of<br>layers of paint so often speak of it<br>like a painting and then I just picked<br>all the stuff I like to throw at you<br>guys so number one as I said they chose<br>to keep these silos they also chose to<br>keep the marine industry so in here we<br>have a super yacht marina which is<br>capable of taking up to a three hundred<br>and thirty meter yachts which is quite a<br>lot and quite a lot of money but the<br>marine industry is why we have a harbor<br>right this way we have a city here is<br>because of that beautiful resource that<br>as where boats come and go from and we<br>have a classic yacht marina alongside<br>our super yachts so we have a unique<br>classic yacht<br>in this country they are actually<br>hundreds of years old or a hundred years<br>old not replicas and they are maintained<br>by a group of really committed wonderful<br>professionals we're very careful about<br>how we make signs in silo Park we we're<br>very very very strict on signage and so<br>if we're telling you that you're not<br>allowed to bring your alcohol we're not<br>going to say just no alcohol beyond this<br>point or output line through it or<br>something like that we'll think of a<br>cute way to do it we're just trying to<br>you know wake you up<br>maybe maybe make you realise it was a<br>human asking you to do that and maybe<br>you have a slightly different response<br>so if it was just a red circle with the<br>line through it really early on we<br>realized that we had a major problem<br>with small children not in general just<br>they wanted to move very quickly across<br>the streets to get to the playground and<br>our urban designers said you can't do<br>anything about that it's a shared space<br>it's not really a shared space it's a 50<br>K zone so we had a slight health and<br>safety problem going on and so we<br>weren't allowed to touch the roadway but<br>we were allowed to touch this but so he<br>made these things which were called the<br>Grebe's and that name has stuck we<br>worked out that if you do something on<br>the side of the road which is cute and<br>slightly animated children will stop so<br>the parents could say stop at the<br>seesnake the other thing that happens is<br>when you've got children playing on the<br>side of the road cars tend to slow down<br>because they don't know what the kids<br>are going to do so suddenly we had this<br>great kind of interface where the cars<br>are going slower and the children are<br>stopping as opposed to what was<br>happening before so we broke a whole lot<br>of urban design rules to do that but we<br>got away with it which was kind of cool<br>our next move was to on pride festival<br>we might have just done a pedestrian<br>crossing and rainbow colors on the<br>street and we now have pedestrian<br>crossings as a result because they<br>couldn't really take them away so we do<br>break the rules every now and then when<br>we can see a need but we do it in a<br>really friendly cute way we partner with<br>the city mission that's the only it's<br>the only charity that we really throw<br>our weight against because in many ways<br>it represents the deepest need that the<br>city has in terms of people that really<br>deserve a place to live or support and<br>just running their family and the city<br>missions motto was Aucklanders for<br>Aucklanders so it's a reminder that we<br>could do a lot to look after each other<br>in the city and so we staged a christmas<br>gig for the city mission and they come<br>and they fundraise and they tell their<br>story at that time we do something for<br>Valentine's Day it's the one rule that<br>I've made is that the Princess Bride<br>must be play<br>on Valentine's Day every day as our<br>every year or else people will get in<br>trouble and so we lift out some crayons<br>and people could just write notes to<br>each other and most of the notes were<br>about silo park or to solo park which<br>was kind of bizarre but lovely at the<br>same time we very heavily celebrate<br>Matariki and that's just becoming a<br>growing and growing conversation for the<br>city in this country which is pretty<br>jolly exciting but we do quite a major<br>thing in the last weekend of Martha<br>Dickey where artists will come down and<br>light all of the bits of the bits of the<br>park and bring in installations and do<br>music and do food and all sorts of<br>things which is pretty special pretty<br>humbling right now we have the Auckland<br>festival and that's really the best<br>review of ever had that Jonathan Bielski<br>came and said this is where I would like<br>the heart of my festival to be so we<br>have this giant stage down there now<br>which isn't kind of crazy this is eerie<br>dangerous Pele practicing the day before<br>they performed but it is such an amazing<br>thing to have our major arts festival<br>have its heart down and out in our<br>beautiful little silo Park so that's<br>pretty groovy and this is um this is a<br>very brave lady who's head of creative<br>strategy for Auckland Council a very<br>groovy person and she lives in front of<br>penny Brook and this is the pop drop<br>installation which is a giant inflated<br>polythene thing which you can just jump<br>up and down on which seems deeply<br>dangerous but always has children all<br>over it having a fantastic sign and<br>sometimes grown-ups as well so there's<br>sort of an amazing amount of creativity<br>going on inside a park right now which<br>is other people bringing it speaking of<br>amazing creativity this is the only<br>known photograph I have of the laneway<br>festival so it was worth talking about<br>laneway we we are there we were there<br>first monogamous relationship in the<br>city which I'm quite proud of they're<br>quite a large festival and they're not<br>easy to have a monogamous relationship<br>with but they we now have residents<br>living in the 1-yard quarter so unless<br>laneway was prepared to go acoustic it<br>wasn't going to fit for much longer<br>and probably the brand of that gig has<br>moved on a little bit so the fact that<br>it now happens in your space is really<br>exciting on a whole bunch of levels but<br>I'm pretty proud that we managed to pull<br>it off for a few years there for a while<br>dia we did a thing called the Mears<br>movie where we did actually ask the<br>mayor what movie he'd like played or she<br>on the Friday night of anniversary<br>weekend so we'd often give them quite a<br>curated list to<br>from please choose from one of these two<br>films but it was a great thing and just<br>an opportunity to kind of celebrate our<br>politicians and our public space and<br>kind of make a thing about that we<br>celebrate the 1-yard quarters birthday<br>every year and that was a kind of a<br>stupid cute thing that we thought up in<br>the first year too full of space in<br>August but it's ended up being a thing<br>and we now have about 20,000 people<br>coming to wish the Wynyard quarter a<br>happy birthday which is a little crazy<br>and kind of lovely but we program it<br>just by thinking this year we'll be<br>thinking like a 7 year old so this was a<br>balloon forest when we turned 4 that you<br>could just run through but more often<br>than not we're trying to do things from<br>the perspective of a child because that<br>means children will like it but it also<br>means grownup might be able to revisit<br>they're in a child or they might be able<br>to be there with their child or they<br>might dunno they might find another<br>grown-up and have a childlike<br>conversation but I think I'm gonna quote<br>Miranda at the moment but if we could<br>have 1/10 of the joy of a six-year-old<br>the world would be a better place so we<br>do use a lot of our programming power in<br>the windowed quarter to try and remind<br>people that it's okay to be happy it's<br>okay to be childlike it's okay to have a<br>sense of wonderment this bloke works for<br>Titan engineering so Titan engineering<br>is the business that is right next door<br>to silo park and right next door to<br>Titan engineering you've got firth<br>concrete trucks and just up the road<br>you've got BST and stilt Haven who have<br>all the exploding stuff in the tanks so<br>all the stuff north of silo park is<br>really quite hazardous material and we<br>only get to run silo pipe the way we do<br>because we have a relationship with all<br>of those people that work to the north<br>and they're amazing people they're very<br>patient with us and we have a very very<br>robust see the dialogue going on they<br>know they can call us at any stage and<br>the fact that their workers come and<br>play giant Jenga in the park is kind of<br>cool they you know they have no reason<br>to like us we represent their demise at<br>some point those tanks are going to be<br>moved on and it will turn into a<br>headland park but they still celebrate<br>this work because they know what it's<br>doing for the city so that's another<br>sort of Gold Star that I'm quite proud<br>of and Manny said it but crikey if we're<br>not building our city for people then<br>who the heck are we building them for<br>we've only done this work because of a<br>huge range of phenomenal people two of<br>the people I work with are Paul Nichol<br>and Lehi<br>Stowers and they're the two they're the<br>couple that run the windowed quarter<br>Paul he worries about what things that<br>plug in and Lee Hom worries about the<br>kind of art and the creativity and I<br>asked them to choose me their favorite<br>photos of silo park and Lehane chose a<br>photo of a sunset with the bridge and<br>Paul chose a photo of his dog but they<br>pretty much spend all of their working<br>time and all of their sleeping time and<br>all of their time with their families<br>thinking about silo park and thinking<br>about the waterfront and it's this<br>incredible kind of generosity of staff<br>and contractors and contributors that I<br>think you guys see when you come down<br>there there's people who genuinely care<br>about the space and love it pouring that<br>love into the space I think that's<br>visible these two gentlemen Simon Eric<br>Russell and the second and this is Angus<br>Muir and I have the exact same photo<br>pretty much from 2011 where there's no<br>reeds and there's no super yachts and<br>it's all very new but Angus is now like<br>a very internationally sought after<br>lighting designer and he cut his teeth<br>in silo park he's designed the Auckland<br>festival set up and he's buzzed around<br>vivid and all sorts of places to do<br>groovy lighting stuff and Simon really<br>deserves like 99.9 percent of the credit<br>for solar parks programming I don't know<br>how much that man has seen his family<br>the last seven years but he runs a<br>phenomenal team organization called<br>fresh concept and they live in the park<br>from December through April this year<br>and just make sure that it's going well<br>and they are dealing with the security<br>guards and the licensing guys and the<br>cleaning and all of the food vendors and<br>every single artist that you see and<br>every single bit of licensing being a<br>movie up and every single Facebook post<br>that has made good or bad as his crew<br>wrangling it and making sure it's what a<br>beautifully prayed orchestra and without<br>that kind of level of generosity and<br>cleverness it wouldn't be the space that<br>you see today I wanted to this is that<br>but I told you about many I used to work<br>in theatre this is a picture from a show<br>called here that we did and Oh crikey<br>win was the Twin Towers there was the<br>same year as the Twin Towers - thank you<br>for all can theater company and the<br>reason I put the slide up is the<br>diversity of humans that make a play is<br>the point so you have Simon pressed who<br>made all computer company and you have a<br>the choreographer Miriam Schulze<br>assistant<br>of a driver receipt and talking to<br>microphone you have lighting dude you<br>have a sound dude you have a stage<br>manager you have a set designer dude<br>where you sit designer dude you have a<br>lady who gets the props you had the man<br>in charge of all the guns and then<br>you've a whole bunch of actors who are<br>prepared to take their clothes off and<br>the thing about a play is that it takes<br>a massively diverse range of people to<br>make it happen and it takes a stage that<br>was built by somebody and a bunch of<br>people selling tickets and a bunch of<br>people telling people about the play and<br>no one of that department is trying to<br>get another Department fired more often<br>they don't try to sleep with each other<br>but there's no sense of you you should<br>get out because that's my patch there's<br>just an under a deep understanding that<br>we all do this together and there's an<br>audience coming and we're working for<br>that audience's experience and so and so<br>one of the great shocks of coming to<br>work for Council was walking away from<br>that sort of environment into a deeply<br>politicized environment and I keep going<br>back to this I keep going back to I know<br>silo parts work because of the range of<br>humans that we've got down there<br>contributing and a generous we've got to<br>get this on and it's got to be amazing<br>kind of level not a divisive I hate your<br>guts and you know I'm gonna send you a<br>slightly bitter email kind of liberal<br>that's simply not as what has gone into<br>making this space it's come from a<br>really different thing from the very<br>clever designers to the very clever<br>strategic people who said keep the silos<br>in the first place so the engineers who<br>made that weird gantry thing so the<br>artists that contributed to the boys to<br>everything that happened that will<br>happen this Friday night when we play a<br>movie which I ought to know that<br>would've been clear funding in the movie<br>that's a huge huge generous<br>collaborative act and that's why that<br>space exists like it does I'm going to<br>now do a short sociology lecture this is<br>a picture of Paul Biya there's not a lot<br>of polar bears in silo park but this is<br>a Pallavi that used to be in the<br>Auckland Zoo when I was a small child<br>and we remembered it as the dancing<br>polar bear and we thought that it was<br>dancing because it was happy and it<br>wasn't dancing because it was heavy<br>there's a thing called zoo kosis which<br>animals get if they're in an environment<br>which is bad for the animal poorly<br>designed environment this bowler beer<br>was green it had mold on it<br>I remember it very vividly being green<br>and so when an animal starts to suffer<br>process it becomes less sociable it goes<br>up it's food it stops breeding it tends<br>to be more aggressive we're<br>fundamentally animals so what happens<br>when you walk into a space like this how<br>does it make you feel how does it make<br>you behave that's some of the best<br>tagging I've ever found for a PowerPoint<br>presentation an awful lot of our spaces<br>in Auckland look like this or feel like<br>this or worse in fact so this is why I<br>was angry this is why I think we can do<br>better in our town and if we could<br>understand ourselves as humans a bit<br>better and take that into the building<br>of our spaces we'd have a better city<br>we're pretty fundamental creatures us<br>human beings you know you've got an<br>awful lot of programming that's just<br>running behind your eyeballs without you<br>knowing there's a lot of stuff from your<br>childhood or your parents child or<br>whatever that's making you decide what<br>you think about a person what you think<br>about me what you think about the person<br>next to you and you're not in charge of<br>most of it you've got this kind of<br>impression that your client just brain's<br>in charge it's not and so we've made<br>this this particular housing development<br>was built in the 1970s and pulled down<br>15 or 18 years later because it was a<br>complete failure so how much resource<br>went into building something that then<br>failed that caused a whole lot of social<br>problems that then had to be pulled down<br>and rebuilt what happened there and I<br>think it's a no-brainer to look at that<br>thing and go here that probably wasn't<br>going to work ladies and gentlemen and<br>I'm really grateful that I've been given<br>this opportunity down in silo Park to<br>think slightly differently and with<br>leadership by people like Bob Harvey and<br>John Dalzell and my boss rod mailer we<br>have this space to play and we were<br>gifted this opportunity of go and make<br>people like it for us and that weird<br>like drawing and then I get to work with<br>people like Simon and we get to have<br>people to enough of care about it like<br>they do like I said you've got this<br>thing that just stops you from walking<br>under trains most of the time and when<br>it sees an email it thinks it's an angry<br>tiger it's not tiger it's an email but<br>your reptilian brain is just tricking<br>along there and really fundamentally we<br>love stories<br>hopefully I've done a good job of<br>telling you a story this evening I've<br>taken you on a wee journey and that's<br>going to get into your brain and a whole<br>other ways they're gonna make you<br>remember it cuz I'm evil and I've read<br>books but you are here two or three or<br>four hundred thousand years down the<br>track because we've developed these bits<br>of our brain<br>learned how to remember stuff and<br>socialized and I mainly put up the site<br>to prove to you that I know how to do<br>research like Google Google Image Search<br>brain and data and brain on stories but<br>I really really like this one<br>that if I was showing you facts you've<br>got two little bits firing off whereas<br>if I tell you a story quite a lot of<br>your brain is getting activated so we're<br>kind of trying to operate on this level<br>of human bein beings are complex clever<br>emotional creatures and we want to turn<br>on all of those bits of your brain so<br>when it comes to these guys they're<br>maybe not after that kind of experience<br>but maybe we can twist their brains a<br>little bit and so I know a closing night<br>of World Cup when it was deeply<br>stressful down there we played the<br>world's fastest Indian as the movie<br>before the game and the whole crowd sat<br>down and watched the film and then stood<br>up at the end and clapped and hugged<br>each other and then we went into the<br>final and other fanzones were just<br>dealing with like really unhappy really<br>cross people all the time all the way<br>through so we kind of moved our thinking<br>on from just pocketed event spaces and a<br>transactional experience if people come<br>and get a thing and then leave and into<br>thinking slightly more emotionally we<br>moved on from just thinking about you've<br>been given a delivery<br>something to deliver do it and then get<br>out this is the only known photo of that<br>fan zone by the way once they Gillan<br>some rubbish burns and that was a<br>success<br>but yeah there's not a lot to feel<br>anything about there and so yeah great<br>training but good to move on from there<br>we're trying to make spaces like I said<br>before that cause moments of human<br>interaction and hopefully joy and<br>hopefully you know delight if it's<br>negative we hope they find a way through<br>it but ultimately it's up to those human<br>beings to have those experiences and<br>take them away with them there's<br>actually the top of the stairs I farted<br>so you're standing in my fat love from<br>your mum's and it's not the quote I want<br>to share with you tonight um I found<br>this on the Brooklyn Bridge right when<br>my dad was dying of cancer and I think<br>it's really really true we're not in a<br>hurry you're probably going to die like<br>like I know you are like I'm sorry<br>there's not me to be offensive I know<br>you're gonna die I know I'm gonna die so<br>why not take the time to get it right<br>while we're here why not think carefully<br>and with generosity while we're here to<br>try and do the best job we can for the<br>people who come after us and I've<br>mentioned creativity a couple of times<br>but one thing I can see<br>deeply lacking in the way that we<br>approach the building of our cities in<br>our places there's creativity and so I'm<br>deeply grateful to know people like many<br>and Andrew and to know that you guys are<br>thinking on this level about how we can<br>kind of take all of our brains our whole<br>right and left brain that's right we've<br>got two halves and get them working<br>together with the other human beings<br>alongside us to do a better job for the<br>places for which we work this is the my<br>favorite photo of silo park and<br>everybody and my team raises me because<br>I use it all the time but this little<br>boy see that the space himself he put<br>the beanbags there so he could jump on<br>them and he just jumped on the beanbag<br>for like half an hour or like just jump<br>get up jump get up jump get up jump and<br>he made that space that's his space he<br>felt secure about that space he was in<br>charge of that space so what's his<br>experience of silo park what does he<br>take home and when he's a grown up<br>person doing something amazing for the<br>city what's the memory that he carries<br>with him and he's got a dad here who's<br>feeling pretty chill with a beer and<br>behind them was a couple there's another<br>joke about this well it's a really<br>diverse crowd because there's a ginger<br>on it but I'll move on from there<br>so back to this back to my opening<br>speech that I'm a bit cross now I read<br>this with different eyes now I read this<br>with maybe there is a change of foot and<br>it's a good thing and it is scary and<br>there's people freaking out and maybe<br>the pissed at us cause a bit worried<br>because it doesn't feel like it's very<br>stable anymore<br>and maybe those who need a bit of<br>control are kind of going hang on a<br>second that's getting a bit wobbly out<br>there<br>okay there's a girl in charge of the<br>country and she's pregnant maybe that's<br>okay maybe that's what we need maybe we<br>need a bit of disruption maybe we need a<br>bit of courage to look at our systems<br>and go how well are they working<br>are they the really best thing for us to<br>do right now can we see two generations<br>ahead and make sure that we're looking<br>after them as much as we're looking<br>after our own interests and so back to<br>silo Park for a second I'm so very<br>grateful to be asked to come and stand<br>here today and I'm so very grateful that<br>that Park is speaking in a way that<br>makes people like Manny go that that's<br>something I want to hear about and it is<br>this collective effort but maybe we can<br>make a different City maybe we can focus<br>on what humans need and do something<br>that is beyond the cars and beyond the<br>numbers and beyond the commercial and<br>into actually the life of the city so as<br>a we test for you which is the most<br>resilient of these and if anybody thinks<br>it's are you wrong we're aiming for the<br>Sadie<br>that there's a whole bunch of people<br>talking to a whole bunch of other people<br>and no one's no one centralized<br>everybody's got a bit to play so if I<br>fall over the system still stays intact<br>council doesn't think like a system it<br>needs to it works for a system which is<br>all concerning so yeah it's best we can<br>oh there's an interesting little word<br>there I mean what Ram means son means<br>the Sun which I like clearly meant to do<br>quick personal story um that's my<br>grandfather poem aggression I don't know<br>who he is but he's really important and<br>they're all standing on a model of the<br>harbor that my grandfather built so he<br>was an engineer for the harbor board and<br>what was going on here is they were<br>testing they were going to build a new<br>Wharf so they were testing what those<br>new walls would do to the water pattern<br>so underneath here there was a<br>completely accurate title representation<br>of the sea bed of the white scimitar so<br>the point being that that have a test<br>see what happens and figure out if the<br>wards are in the right place or the<br>right structures or whatever so I found<br>this picture and I thought this is a<br>really excellent metaphor for<br>placemaking for me because there's my<br>grandfather and he's testing these<br>little model Wars before they go and<br>burn probably 30 pounds or whatever<br>would've been in those days on building<br>permanent wards this is what we try and<br>do is place makers I'm gonna go in and<br>do a test beach or I'm going to maybe<br>shut down a car park for a day and see<br>if it works as a public space before you<br>shut it down permanently and then we'll<br>see if it works will test him with trial<br>second thing for me though is that's my<br>grandfather standing on the window<br>corner he helped build this place that<br>little Wharf there is called McCallum's<br>wolf which was my grandmother's family<br>that was my great-grandfather who used<br>to run the rich single up and down the<br>harbor my father was really integral and<br>rezoning this for marine use and my<br>uncle's first job was in the vas shed so<br>my connection through to the 1-yard<br>Quarter is really deep in me and my<br>responsibility is to bein McGlashan and<br>Archie McCallum and those people that go<br>before me so these are the stories that<br>I need to be responsible to for the win<br>yard quarter and so when we go and we do<br>our place making in other places I use<br>this slide to go I'm looking for Bain<br>McGlashan and his granddaughter to make<br>sure that I honor these places and the<br>stories of them and i genuinely believe<br>this and now that i'm in a good mood<br>because you guys have given me the<br>opportunity to expand all of my demons<br>I genuinely get up in the morning<br>cuz of the slide and and the most<br>important word is that one for me just a<br>little bit if I made that little boy<br>happy because he could jump on that<br>beanbag for half an hour then I made the<br>city a little better and if every single<br>one of us got up and thought like that<br>especially those of us won't wait for<br>council the city would be exponentially<br>a lot better now but the for those of<br>you born after like 1990 which I fear is<br>like most of you you won't know what<br>I've done here so I'm now going to<br>explain it um in my in my slightly<br>grumpy try to finish off my presentation<br>state I realized the only way to finish<br>it off was a reference to the Dark<br>Crystal hands up a few remember the Dark<br>Crystal film thank you good sir<br>and you so it's a movie about the forces<br>good help me guys I forget this wrong<br>forces of good and evil and there's<br>these two two little creatures two<br>little creatures Jim and Kyra who have<br>to kind of help forces of good and evil<br>and there's these creatures called the<br>mystics which are warm loving spiritual<br>beings who raise Jim all very lovely and<br>these evil chaps called the Skeksis who<br>are a little bit money hungry a little<br>bit power-hungry and at the end the<br>Skeksis and the Mystics come together<br>and they create this being that XE is I<br>think it is who is what we should be<br>balanced there's an understanding of<br>kind of commercial and kind of you know<br>for the good of me and there's also an<br>understanding for the good of all a<br>better right brain left brain a bit of<br>unconditional love and just love love<br>for myself and that really at the end of<br>the day I thought man if council could<br>be bet the city could be number one on<br>happiness number one on livability and<br>number one on awesomeness but we need to<br>come together mystics and Skeksis to<br>for a couple of questions but what's the<br>long term you'll see it's up 30 years<br>from now what will be happening down is<br>a kind of very big commitment receipts<br>in which adds all development happens<br>you'll be able to kind of stick down the<br>involvement because other I promised<br>myself I'd get through tonight without<br>make a joke about the America's Cup so<br>I'm never gonna honor that promise and<br>do it um I think I think there's a<br>there's a great quote from an amazing<br>lady from New York it's his public space<br>in each Champions and I think when<br>you're dealing with a hero shop like<br>silo that deserves to always have<br>someone running it and like fit square<br>in Melbourne or Central Park in New York<br>they've got they've got bodies that are<br>built to run them right and look after<br>them yeah so I think I think the city<br>deserves an 80s query so that if it will<br>get least as the development<br>Slavens so at the moment we're in<br>heavy-duty crazy time and as and the<br>parks now like like with the open<br>festival tuning that more and more<br>people are coming into their own accord<br>but I would hope that there is always<br>our body who's keeping an eye on that<br>and making sure that it's not just<br>tuning into talks weird right and the<br>how does that is there a sense in which<br>else we like it like what's them like as<br>Eric I'm sue zero bucket of effort of a<br>certain size that you're having to kind<br>of spread around the city like muttering<br>little bit I mean yeah I've got people<br>that we think so we're now we're now for<br>indifferent a big reduction seven the<br>blue ones I don't know if it's gonna be<br>that the same way side okay I would<br>point the son of the model if I don't<br>think it's reinvigorated and gets to be<br>a my ass weird but yeah there's a<br>business next bit of courage and a bonus<br>beings<br>how do you create passive spots it<br>doesn't take it because there's a lot of<br>parts there's a lot there are a lot of<br>green spaces open spaces and Auckland<br>and really a lot of them maybe a lot of<br>a lot of it they deserve because they<br>were a pest of the place rather than<br>like an active place it<br>maybe they don't make one of the<br>strongest cuts a favorite we've got<br>around the weight on the task spaces it<br>should be a contempt of space that<br>shouldn't be activated it should be<br>quiet<br>but you're absolutely right and I think<br>this is the and my perfect world<br>starting started tonight stuck with only<br>Beck's I'll open my perfect world we've<br>got to be able to look at what is<br>special about each part of Auckland and<br>and and really honor its public spaces<br>because I don't I think we're still a<br>bit obsessed about our private car and<br>our quarter acre section and we need to<br>start seeing our public spaces as Civic<br>assets in a very important but you're<br>absolutely right being able to do that<br>thought and research and going this<br>space needs high level intervention it's<br>got a whole lot of people around that<br>want to come out or it needs to be just<br>quite intuitive there needs a few more<br>treats but whatever it needs but that<br>kind of place-based thinking and then it<br>does it's gonna need the locals to<br>induce the net mainly through usage but<br>I'm with you I don't think everything<br>needs buddy and me always a sports re it<br>doesn't need a movie every Friday night<br>to make it a successful space you don't<br>need hundreds of thousands of people to<br>make a successful space you need one kid<br>double with a bean bag one person<br>reading a book so if you've got a space<br>in mind that's on a dot area give you a<br>cat human beings need lots of different<br>types of activity right we don't just<br>always want to be running around you<br>need spaces to think as well I'm kind of<br>want to finish on a place can you go and<br>change the world you love the people<br>that are after design things<br>you know making stuff they don't just do<br>it the more people there make the world<br>better the bit a little bit thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
