Drones, biometric scanning, artificial milk and meat are all set  to change the face of farming, but there are also ethical considerations. Dr Nick Munn is an environmental philosopher who is looking at the challenges that new technologies bring to our existing ethical systems. Come and visit us in the Pavilion and chat to Dr Munn. <br><br>More information: http://www.waikato.ac.nz/events/fieldays<br><br>music:teknoaxe.com</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>environmental philosophy is about the<br>relationship between humans in the world<br>and what kinds of things we do in the<br>world and whether we should be doing<br>those things I'm interested in new<br>technologies and how they impact farming<br>so an obvious one is drones something<br>which is slightly less obvious is new<br>alternatives to meat and milk so<br>artificially created milk artificially<br>created meat which can change the<br>industry some ethical considerations<br>with drones involve privacy who can see<br>what you're doing and when whether<br>farmers are treating their animals well<br>and you know what kinds of things people<br>know about what's going on on farms with<br>artificial milk and artificial meat<br>there are economic and ethical<br>considerations sometimes people might<br>decide that traditional meters less<br>ethical then these new ways and this can<br>put the farmers livelihoods at risk<br>farming could benefit a lot from some of<br>these new technologies things like<br>drones can provide faster easier access<br>for farmers to isolated areas things<br>like biometric scanning can help farmers<br>keep on top of know how their animals<br>are doing even where their animals are<br>through GPS and this can help farms be<br>more efficient there are quite a few<br>challenges involved in this a lot of it<br>is that these technologies are new<br>farmers might not have used them before<br>they might not know how to use them you<br>need to train you don't have much time<br>to train the technology is still<br>changing you need to be able to adapt<br>and you need to be able to cope with the<br>costs involved farmers need to be aware<br>of new technologies they need to embrace<br>them and adapt to them because they're<br>not going away and if farmers don't pay<br>attention to them they risk being left<br>behind</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
