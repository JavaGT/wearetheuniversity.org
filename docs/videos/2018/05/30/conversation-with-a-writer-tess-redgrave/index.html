automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is t3 grave I've worked at the<br>University in a variety of roles for<br>about 12 years<br>in 2013 I did the nurses of creative<br>writing and from that I already had a<br>piece of writing but from that has come<br>this novel gone to Pegasus which has<br>just been published go back to 1998 I'd<br>had I had two young kids living in<br>Auckland and I wanted an adventure and I<br>went off down to Stuart Island and<br>joined a sea kayaking group down to the<br>bottom of right hand corner of Stuart<br>owner to put Pegasus but Pegasus is most<br>remote harbour in New Zealand I think<br>there's no civilization there whatsoever<br>it's wild it's got mountains called gog<br>and magog and board cone they've all<br>lost their tops because of the Roaring<br>Forties winds that blast and there we<br>camped and kayaks and we heard Kiwis at<br>night and when explored an old tin<br>mining operation and I spent a lot of<br>that trip dreaming and I started<br>dreaming up a novel a story that I<br>wanted to write and somehow I let a<br>pilot light that has never gone out from<br>there one of the other original aspects<br>of this novel as I had a<br>great-grandfather that came out to New<br>Zealand from Scotland in 1877 and he had<br>died by 1892 left a wife and five<br>children and had always been covered up<br>and my family as what had happened to<br>him in fact he died found out that he<br>had died in Ashbourne Hall as a 32 year<br>old and I was I wasn't reached to<br>understand what had happened there and<br>why it had been so buried and I started<br>writing about him and Dunedin and I put<br>him in Sea Cliff lunatic asylum and then<br>I realized I couldn't have a novel just<br>about a madman what it was going to be<br>so depressing so I started looking at<br>his wife and his wife had been very<br>involved with the temperance movement<br>after he died she became a was<br>apparently a god-fearing Bible holder<br>for the rest of her life and she lived<br>unto her ninth<br>so then I had her and him and the novel<br>was characters and but I realize this<br>time you've got to get drama or an<br>interest and I realized I still needed<br>more and I needed a foil for her she was<br>going to be the straight-up temperance<br>woman so I had this woman grace come<br>from India to New Zealand who already<br>knew a lot about suffrage and was a<br>fierce supporter of suffrage and I put<br>those two together and it was fireworks<br>its 1892 and Dunedin and that's the year<br>before woman won the vote in New Zealand<br>and there's gathering momentum to<br>separate the temperance movement which<br>was getting men to stop drinking<br>basically and the franchise movement<br>which was purely petitioning government<br>to give women the vote and there was a<br>big meeting in Dunedin which is in my<br>novel which is about the separation of<br>temperance and franchise and the<br>franchise Union is formed in Dunedin<br>well my early background was journalism<br>and I'd learned I'd written a lot of<br>features and I'd learned how to research<br>and I knew I knew papers past really<br>well which as a huge was historical<br>resource in New Zealand I spent our hip<br>screeds suitcases full of research on<br>Tim mining and on the suffragettes and<br>Dunedin sister II and I had the start of<br>a novel but it was chunked full of<br>research and it was just plug II and I<br>applied to the Creative Writing course<br>and was very fortunate that Michele<br>Liggett who's also interested in 19th<br>century woman picked it up and she was<br>one of the mentors on the course that I<br>was going to be on in 2013 said I want<br>to do this Michelle was very intuitive<br>to work for and she just sort of helped<br>me shake all the research loose and get<br>to the bones of the story and make the<br>story work and quite a poetic way she<br>she thought that I had the character<br>from India there whose core grace and<br>becomes another name later and the novel<br>she thought she was far too good to be<br>the minor character<br>that we had and so really with<br>Michelle's help I made the two woman<br>characters the two main characters<br>William was there but who then he was<br>often Seacliff lunatic asylum so that<br>has ramifications further down the novel<br>and he is an important part but it was<br>became these two woman and it was really<br>Michelle that helped me do that and<br>which we actually went overboard after I<br>finished the creative writing course I<br>had I looked at it and I thought there's<br>but too much of grace she's taken over<br>she's taken over my novel so I had to go<br>away and put her back again journalism<br>you give all the information you've got<br>out front you throw it at the reader a<br>novel you give them a tiny little bit<br>and then you hold a lot back and then<br>down here you give them a tiny little<br>bit more and a tiny little bit more so<br>that you create you know the sense of<br>Paul and now to have Paul and mystery<br>and intrigue that draws you river<br>through and I learned a huge amount from<br>her and she was particularly good<br>because she is essentially a poet and<br>but you know a poet and a journalist<br>working together two completely opposite<br>ways of approaching a piece of writing<br>so I learned about when to give and when<br>to hold back and it was yeah that was I<br>can't thank Michelle enough it was<br>wonderful working with her and she's<br>still she's still there and not<br>the hardest part of this novel has been<br>listening to all the different advice<br>I've gotten help and working out what is<br>right for me and what where is my voice<br>and I think if I come away with anything<br>it's knowing my voice now and I will<br>take that in to whatever I do next</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
