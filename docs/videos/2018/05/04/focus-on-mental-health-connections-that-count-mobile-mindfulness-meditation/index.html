going to be slightly more<br>informal than we would normally have and<br>and this is the second of our hot health<br>sort of topics one a month and with the<br>idea that this is a place for<br>interaction to actually meet each other<br>informally first and with food and some<br>fluid a few if you want I was going to<br>say alcohol but I couldn't say that and<br>the but that purpose is actually to try<br>and promote interdisciplinary thinking<br>and working and so we hope that there's<br>a range of people here who will interact<br>in an area that so actually of a broad<br>interest the issue of mental health<br>especially with our young people<br>especially with the dramatic changes<br>that we've had in the last twenty years<br>around the use of our personal phones in<br>particular which is affecting everybody<br>from our infants and babies who we now<br>see in video studies that I've been<br>involved in where mothers breastfeeding<br>a baby in bed at night and all the time<br>and still looking at the baby she is now<br>looking at her cell phone and texting<br>other people in the middle of the night<br>when she's feeding right through to<br>adolescents who come into my clinic room<br>and are always on their phone and I<br>might talk to mother and occasionally I<br>almost have to attempt the adolescence<br>and I've got the new game on my look at<br>this and it's a depression rating app<br>that allows me to get a look at the<br>mental health in a medium that they<br>actually understand more than I do so<br>we've got two people today when a PhD<br>student who's Co supervisor in<br>psychology and our own mental health<br>department and Damian scarf who comes<br>from psychology and I think they're<br>going to do a duo and so we're going to<br>start with Damian thank you very much<br>for visiting us and we're looking<br>forward to hearing what you better say<br>so so um hello I'm from psychology so<br>this is a my neck of the woods so I'm<br>going to go over I'm some of the work<br>that colleagues in university of<br>queensland been doing and that we've<br>been doing here I'm looking at social<br>identity and health and so and the talk<br>I'm going to go over<br>um the background or the social identity<br>health of the approach um that we take<br>then I'm going to go over to example so<br>one looking at the application of this<br>approach to depression and adults and<br>then another one looking at it in terms<br>of resilience in youth and so the basic<br>idea around this approach is that we're<br>part of lots of groups so you might<br>identify yourself this appearance and<br>you might see yourself also in the<br>context of work around around your<br>colleagues we might play sport and you<br>also may be part of a rep group and<br>these are all the identities that you<br>have and rather than being something<br>that's separate from us or separate from<br>our own identity or our sense of self<br>these things actually inform who we are<br>so they become our identities in the<br>basic idea around the social identity<br>approach to health see you for short is<br>that these aren't just things that we<br>have or things that don't matter<br>these have really important implications<br>for mental health so the groups that<br>were part of provide our lives with lots<br>of different things they provide our<br>lives of meaning and they provide our<br>lives with purpose and they provide our<br>our lives with positive interactions<br>with others and people who view us<br>positively I mean all these things have<br>really important implications for health<br>and so one way I guess to demonstrate<br>this is so this is from a large mirror<br>analysis looking at the morbid topic of<br>your odds of decrease mortality so lower<br>chances of dying looking at lots of<br>different predictors and so one would be<br>here so this is the Equality rather than<br>breathing breast not breathing because<br>obviously that would take off many more<br>years of life um BMI so this is the one<br>that we hear about a lot<br>exercises another one we hear about a<br>lot drinking and smoking but what the<br>largest predictor was was social<br>connectedness this doesn't mean everyone<br>come I show this figure people look at<br>the social connectiveness bar and think<br>that they can add up you know being<br>overweight and not exercising and<br>drinking then as long as they stay<br>connected with other people will cancel<br>out the bottom lines but it's not edited<br>that's not how it works<br>but the basic point is that it matters<br>much more than I guess most people think<br>it matters so when you go to the doctor<br>the doctor really asks you about how<br>many groups you belong to and how<br>important they are to you they usually<br>just ask you whether you're eating<br>healthy and exercising so the point here<br>is that maybe they should be asking<br>about our groups maybe they should be<br>asking whether we've got connections and<br>whether there's people and that we<br>interact with on a daily basis in a<br>meaningful way and so when we think<br>about social connectedness and<br>especially now with social media and<br>things there's lots of different ways I<br>guess you could define it and there's<br>lots of different ways people do define<br>them and so one way would just be the<br>size of your network another way would<br>be how much contact you have so whether<br>you talk to the people in your network<br>or how many people you talk to and then<br>the third one would be identification so<br>your subjective feelings about the group<br>and what we tend to find is that if you<br>rank them in terms of importance and in<br>terms of predictability of how well they<br>predict health outcomes that size of<br>your social network actually predicts<br>very little every 2,000 Facebook friends<br>doesn't give you very much having<br>contact with those people gives you a<br>little bit more but it still doesn't<br>give you a great deal but actually gives<br>you the most is that sense of belonging<br>and identity and acceptance that you<br>feel with others so if you think there's<br>work with family and looking at contact<br>with family versus identification with<br>family you know those studies clearly<br>show that it's not really contact it<br>tells us the most and you can have<br>contact with your family without<br>necessarily having interactions that are<br>really helpful for mental health and of<br>course the flipside is is that<br>you look at what's the largest that most<br>of the time or the biggest groups are<br>the ones we have contact with and we<br>actually have very few connections<br>relatively speaking that we identify<br>with so here's all my Facebook friends<br>just to give an example each one<br>represents one and this represents the<br>network between and so looking at this<br>doesn't tell us much so this would be a<br>standard network size look and this<br>doesn't really tell us anything it<br>doesn't tell us what those connections<br>are like how often I contact those<br>people and how valuable those<br>connections are to me and so one<br>approach to using this or implementing<br>this is to give people a new identity a<br>new group and see what impact that has<br>there's lots of different groups so the<br>choir is one example but they have arts<br>and crafts group and groups that<br>basically serve all different aspects of<br>arts and sports so for people who sports<br>isn't a possibility they have arts<br>groups that they can join and so this<br>study looked at multiple different arts<br>and cultural groups and people that are<br>between forty and forty five most of<br>whom were in unemployment in the<br>majority of whom I'm headed diagnosis of<br>depression and so they got referred to<br>and so they submitted them to so the<br>basic depression scale so looking at<br>whether they experienced positive<br>feelings so feeling downhearted and blue<br>so raining are these measures on a<br>Likert scale and then identification it<br>so identification here is how much they<br>identify with the new group that they've<br>joined so if we look so two time points<br>and we split the sample into those who<br>really identify with this social group<br>so they feeling really accepted with the<br>new group that they've joined<br>they feel that they belong with that<br>group and it's important to them<br>and we look at their depression scores<br>over time with the dotted line<br>representing it cut off and what we find<br>that if you have little identification<br>with that group<br>so you're still connecting with these<br>people you're still hanging out with<br>them you're still going to the group but<br>you don't feel accepted by them you<br>don't see much of a change in depression<br>scores when you look at identification<br>so those who you'll accept it by that<br>group and feel they belong to that group<br>you see a clear decrease so again this<br>demonstrates the when we think about<br>groups contact is just one measure and<br>it's not a very helpful one what we<br>really want to know is how people feel<br>about that group and how they feel other<br>others in the group<br>see them we can look at it also in the<br>context of cognitive behavioral therapy<br>so a group based approach so this group<br>is relative at the same age but their<br>diagnosis is slightly more serious and<br>so again looking at whether in this<br>context so cognitive behavioral therapy<br>and a group context how that had the<br>impact of that approach varies depending<br>on how people feel about that group so<br>again we have a basic depression scale<br>and a basic measure of identification<br>and we effectively find the same thing<br>so in this case both groups show a<br>decrease but the decrease is markedly<br>more with those who identify with their<br>group so again to context in which<br>identification with the group rather<br>than simply having contact with them<br>shows the most explanatory value in<br>terms of decreases in depression now<br>we're going to switch to a different one<br>in speaking of social media I'm going to<br>talk about to sail training<br>interventions for youth so one is the<br>spirit and I guess what defines these<br>things now more than ever is the fact<br>that you don't get to take any<br>technology on board so more and more now<br>it seems more difficult for youth and<br>there's more pressure not just from<br>youth to take their phones on but also<br>from parents so parents not wanting to<br>lose contact with their kids is so used<br>to I guess they<br>to fix them and find them anytime of the<br>day that the idea of their kid gone off<br>into a boat into the middle of the ocean<br>and then might having contact with them<br>they find quite alarming and so the<br>first one we're going to talk about is<br>the spirit so the spirit of New Zealand<br>so trekking kids who take part in this<br>voyage and a brief overview of the<br>voyage so day one you have a group of<br>youth who don't know what another who<br>turn up on the wharf looking uneasy at<br>the fact that they have to talk to<br>people that they've never seen before<br>and once they find quite difficult and<br>then on that first day you get a bunk<br>room and you get assigned to your watch<br>group so this is the group that you're<br>gonna be in throughout the voyage<br>whether it's two o'clock in the morning<br>on watch or whether it's a six o'clock<br>in the morning swim this is the group<br>you're going to be part of for the<br>duration of the voyage and the voyage<br>unfolds in kind of a typical way so the<br>first couple of days the crew take a<br>hands-on policy with the kids they go<br>through a lot of cooperation and group<br>exercises looking at building mastery I<br>mean the kids they have the transition<br>with the crew starts to pull back and<br>the youth start to take control of the<br>ship and then this culminates on day<br>nine where the kids are responsible for<br>running the ship themselves so they take<br>care of everything<br>and the crew sits back unless it looked<br>like it looks like you're going to crash<br>and then on day ten they go back to the<br>dock and in contrast to the first day<br>where they didn't want to look up and<br>talk to each other on the last day they<br>can't leave each other so on the last<br>day they're crying at the wharf at the<br>idea that they have to leave and they're<br>usually extending the voyage somehow by<br>going to like a local restaurant or<br>something and so again that demonstrates<br>that within their ten days you go from a<br>group of kids we can't look at one<br>another to a group of kids who find it<br>difficult to leave one another so the<br>spirit in terms of demographics and they<br>draw from around New Zealand so they're<br>proportion in terms of ethnicity<br>basically matches on the national<br>averages and we look at resilience and<br>so resilience is very complex it has<br>lots of different factors and so this<br>scale tips lots of different things<br>basic ideas of self-discipline keeping<br>interested in things um it's about<br>meaning and questions about how they see<br>themselves and then looking at social<br>support as a control for a basic measure<br>and then identity so whether they feel<br>included and accepted and that they're<br>important of the group is important to<br>them so we look so timeone a few months<br>before the voyage time one the first day<br>time three the last date and time for<br>nine months after that we can peer the<br>spirit kids to a control group and we<br>get an increase in resilience from the<br>first of the last day that's maintained<br>nine months after if we look at identity<br>what predicts the maintenance of<br>resilience is there identification with<br>the group so the voyage has long passed<br>and what predicts or maintains the<br>resilience is the fact that they still<br>feel they have an important Brook that<br>they're part of and an important group<br>that they built a lot of skills around<br>that they overcame a lot of challenges<br>with and the question always is with<br>this type of work is whether it's<br>effective for everyone that takes part<br>so are the kids at the top who are<br>already resilient just getting more<br>resilient or is it really tapping kids<br>at all levels and so we can do a basic<br>moderation analysis and show that the<br>kids who benefit the most from the new<br>identity are those who start off the<br>lowest in resilience so it's not just<br>the kids at the top getting better it's<br>the kids at the bottom coming up a<br>second one so looking at a different<br>population so again the spirit selects<br>kids who although they meant to be of<br>different levels for the most part the<br>spirits recruiting kids who are doing<br>well at this school and so the question<br>always is is whether it applies to other<br>populations and so there's a boat that<br>runs out of Northland so they draw kids<br>exclusively from the title top of our<br>region up there only I think 1% come<br>from outside of that region in terms of<br>the kids that go on the voyage and<br>they're a very different group to the<br>spirit group so when this one the<br>majority of kids they take part in the<br>voyage Amari and they're also slightly<br>younger<br>then the kids who own the spirit with<br>the age range being a bit larger so<br>between kind of 13 to 18 in terms of<br>economic status they're also very<br>different so using daesil as a proxy<br>this is the kids who are in the dsl kind<br>of seven to ten schools the percentage<br>the middle decile schools and in the<br>lower dis article so you can see and for<br>the Maori youth that around sixty five<br>percent are in DeSales one two three so<br>if we're in Dunedin we don't really know<br>what you saw one two three is because we<br>don't necessarily have them here but up<br>there I'm they're very common and that<br>doesn't mean that the school is bad it<br>really just reflects the economic status<br>of the neighborhood and so when working<br>with this sample and using our approach<br>and we also included a positive youth<br>development approach so we know that<br>these kids could be categorized in terms<br>of a range of risk factors but I think<br>it was really important for I'm that<br>voyage to look at it in a slightly<br>different way so in this way we take<br>some of the theories so the circle of<br>courage which is from First Nations<br>people in Canada so again and the<br>overlap I think we're socially generally<br>is clear where they view things as<br>belonged like belonging I'm is really<br>critical and then a model that comes<br>from a youth group in New Zealand where<br>again we have multiple aspects of<br>identity and belonging essential and<br>then aspects of growth outside of that<br>and so again I guess somewhat different<br>to normal positive youth development<br>approaches where identity is kind of one<br>of many good things with these models<br>identity is central and that maps on<br>really well to the social identity<br>approach that we take and so again we<br>have resilience measures identity<br>measures and support measures and the<br>game splitting the sample what we find<br>is that before the voyage the merry kids<br>are significantly lower but by the end<br>of the voyage their levels are<br>comparable unto the zealand european<br>kids<br>more importantly when we split the<br>sample by those who start off alone when<br>those who start off high we see growth<br>in both groups but we see markedly more<br>growth and the kids that start off low<br>it's important when we think about<br>resilience to not look at this data I<br>guess one concern when we look at data<br>like this is that we say well maybe<br>those kids just need to be more<br>resilient but that's not what the<br>interpretation that we apply is the<br>better interpretation is how easy it is<br>to influence the kids resilience how<br>easy it is by giving them a group that<br>accepts them and that cares about them<br>and that's important how easy it is to<br>change it so rather than looking at<br>lists and saying well if they were more<br>resilient that do better<br>I think the interpretation is of how if<br>we give them something and we give them<br>a group how easy it is for them to<br>change and the net set from me so the<br>pink thing is throughout my talk wasn't<br>my favorite color it just reflects our<br>pink shirt then it's coming up so we're<br>a pink shirt on May 18th or if you're<br>fashionable you were a salmon shirt<br>which I view or here is more acceptable<br>so thank you I can take questions<br>let's take this as questions now and<br>before we move on to the next topic so<br>well can I start the second study did<br>you do a nine month follow-up oh no so<br>we haven't done that was only just last<br>year and when we found that the kids<br>that it the scales that we use they<br>actually need quite a bit of help<br>pulling them out oh it's difficult with<br>the spirit because we can just see in<br>the questionnaire and it'll go somewhere<br>and so with those kids were actually<br>doing we're gonna work on qualitative<br>work okay we can actually go and see the<br>kids nine months after right ask them<br>about the voyage in that way and easy<br>for them to finance right now presumably<br>you can have groups that take you in the<br>other directions yes definitely so yeah<br>most parents know that through your<br>friend your children's friends are<br>really critically important yeah it's<br>sure if the groups are in the opposite<br>direction they<br>have as much poke you know that that<br>groups and I think that especially in<br>north and that's one of the things that<br>happens is that lots of the groups out<br>there yeah on the negative side<br>there's not many possibilities on the<br>other and so one of the terms that the<br>youth use up there was and they termed<br>it far nap which is what they said they<br>found out when you have nothing with the<br>games and so again that's I think the<br>Tucker stuff I think demonstrates that<br>if you give them the group they'll latch<br>on to that group and it will be<br>important but if you don't give them a<br>group in even if it's a bad group<br>they'll still find a group because I'd<br>rather have a group then no no okay I've<br>seen what that was so based on you<br>research and things such as social<br>connectedness and peer support are<br>really important and you in this region<br>is maybe five peer support workers<br>funded and social connection is<br>definitely not part of medical model I<br>think that's true I mean that's that's<br>why you never really hear about it when<br>the doctors I guess at the first terms<br>of what salient in their area and I<br>think that is generally true the diet<br>and exercise of viewed is the most<br>important when we know that<br>connectedness is probably even more<br>important but I think that's slightly<br>changing now I think there's more<br>movement towards realizing that<br>connectedness is probably yes there's<br>very little so there's the attacker has<br>to run a tourist operation during the<br>summer just so they can build up enough<br>money to run the youth operation in the<br>winter and so even up there it's it's<br>it's on a shoestring in terms of them<br>continue<br>yeah it does it really<br>thank you it's another question up there<br>justice boy oh it does I love this third<br>question right now can I get this wrong<br>yeah I think the question should be<br>about that ya know um two quick<br>questions first one is how high-risk is<br>the group strategy for resilience if the<br>group falls apart rapidly do you find<br>that the resilience levels tanked so<br>with both the spirit and the Tucker<br>they've put a great deal of effort into<br>crafting the group's so it's not just a<br>random selection of kids and especially<br>what the Tucker<br>they're very cautious in terms of I'm<br>the range of kids that they have on<br>board so having kids from a range of<br>abilities I guess and so we don't really<br>see the group's fall apart there was one<br>voyage where the group did have issues<br>and you do basically see either a flat<br>line in terms of gain or a negative but<br>for the most part both the spirit of the<br>Tucker put considerable time I guess<br>into making sure that the kids that come<br>on board and would complement each other<br>yeah so if they're on hiatus as the<br>groups are at the end basically that<br>idea of the group sticks with you but if<br>it does fall apart or doesn't properly<br>form no benefit or a negative benefit<br>yeah yep yeah<br>and the second thing is size didn't seem<br>to matter at all as that identity you<br>have to the you have the strength of<br>your connections but is there any<br>measure of what it would be like if<br>you're the kind of person that has a<br>strong identity to having like 5,000<br>Facebook friends no because identity is<br>not you can't identify with 5,000 5,000<br>Facebook friends like this isn't really<br>a group as a group really has<br>connections between people with them oh<br>you thinking about having 5,000 Facebook<br>friends is in an 18 well no but I okay<br>so I suppose it's um for for the people<br>who make youtube videos to millions of<br>subscribers and they feel like they have<br>that strong relationship to their<br>audience<br>I suppose it is at that the same kind of<br>thing can you have an audience<br>connection like that I don't think so I<br>think that there there has to be some<br>interaction there has to be some<br>something beyond basically you supplying<br>a product than them being happy with<br>that product you know there's there<br>bonds that they form on the voyage or<br>more because they see them both in good<br>time<br>and bad and so YouTube doesn't really<br>reflect that you don't make YouTube<br>clips necessarily mean you said most of<br>the time and then I also would argue<br>that most there that if you look at the<br>comments on YouTube but you probably get<br>a mix of negatives that may detract from<br>the positives yeah not good thank you<br>John<br>Johnny ketch well done Thank You Damian<br>is there any evidence that the kids on<br>the voyage go out and create<br>opportunities for other kids to be in<br>groups or closer or get a sense of<br>belonging is there an additive effect so<br>that's what we're looking at now and so<br>the idea would be that that is what<br>happens that them having one group<br>basically gives them the confidence<br>because and for some kids it's the first<br>time that they've actually gone through<br>their process of forming a group like<br>that and it's surprising especially with<br>the target how few kids have the<br>confidence that they can actually form<br>those types of connections so the idea<br>is that that gives them the confidence<br>and that spills over into other groups<br>and that's something that hopefully will<br>capture with the qualitative work<br>because it's really hard to capture that<br>type of data in the way that we normally<br>would with quantitative measurements<br>because what you're really talking about<br>as a cultural change yeah yeah yeah that<br>those kids they go out and then they<br>hopefully freak them in others take the<br>voyage but then they also kind of take<br>the skills that they've learned in terms<br>of building groups and confidence and<br>applied in the areas because it Erickson<br>would say that culture is the way that<br>you pass on identity and so you you're<br>attempting in a way to change yeah<br>change the basic culture the way I think<br>in yeah I think that the boat is a<br>perfect place to build that culture yeah<br>this is no other supports there so<br>removing their Facebook and everything<br>else means that you have almost like<br>this island where you can create a new<br>culture may be loose thank you I think<br>that's a great place to stop and thank<br>you very much and we'll move on to Jaden<br>do I think is going to be talking about<br>some of their PhD studies welcome and<br>great to have the youth voice<br>Yoda thanks for coming along<br>alright so people on their phones am i<br>right when I told you about mindfulness<br>meditation today the image that probably<br>comes to mind is something a little like<br>this not this but you really could be<br>wrong we often think that the only way<br>to use technology mindfully is to turn<br>it all off but we live in a world with<br>technology as fundamental it's almost<br>everything we do hands up who's used<br>their phone in the last hour keep your<br>hand raised if you used it in the last<br>half an hour 15 minutes who's using<br>their phones right now to paraphrase<br>Rohan guna Szilagyi the way I see it is<br>we cannot afford to continue to think of<br>technology as being the enemy when it<br>comes to health and well-being because<br>our phones tablets watches and laptops<br>can all move from being devices of<br>distraction to devices of connection<br>both to ourselves and to others but to<br>bastardize jefferson that doesn't mean<br>all mobile health interventions are<br>created equal and that's what I'm here<br>to talk to you about today the ins and<br>outs of where the mindfulness meditation<br>can be delivered mobile e to cultivate<br>mental health and well-being in a<br>student sample and to discuss how much<br>mindfulness you can really squeeze into<br>a 10-minute session so because I've only<br>got 15 minutes for today's speed talk I<br>thought I'd give you a quick definition<br>of mindfulness tell you about the<br>current direction of mindfulness<br>research and then maybe give you a short<br>example of one of the studies that we've<br>run at Oh tiger in the words of Jon<br>kabat-zinn mindfulness is paying<br>attention in a particular way on purpose<br>in the present moment and<br>non-judgmentally it's attending to<br>experiences on a moment-to-moment basis<br>in an effort to cultivate a<br>non-judgmental nonreactive state of<br>awareness and it's terrified by<br>practicing focused attention and open<br>monitoring<br>so with focused attention we're using a<br>specific attentional object to focus<br>intently on often the breath so if you<br>look at our moving shape here we can<br>sink our breathing with it with its<br>movement and this is thought to help<br>enhance our self-monitoring skills as we<br>repeatedly return our attention to the<br>designated object following inevitable<br>distractions<br>whereas open monitoring is a practice of<br>a general awareness of experience<br>without attachment to cognitive or<br>emotional events so instead of avoiding<br>unwanted or under uncomfortable<br>experiences mindfulness encourages<br>practitioners sorry to consciously<br>engage with these experiences attend to<br>them and ultimately observe their<br>transitory nature which is thought to<br>ultimately lead to the alleviation<br>rather than the excessive ation of<br>suffering and the popularity of<br>mindfulness has skyrocketed in recent<br>years what was once practiced by few is<br>now a commercialized thriving industry<br>with mindfulness products ranging from<br>coloring books and beauty products to<br>treatment programs company retreats<br>wearables and apps and this popularity<br>spike has been accompanied by a rapid<br>increase in research on the health<br>benefits of mindfulness and mindfulness<br>meditation which in turn has been<br>accompanied by policy support for the<br>use of mindfulness all over the world<br>for example in the UK the NHS actually<br>prescribes medic mindfulness as as an<br>option for their clients but while there<br>is a substantial body of research<br>touting the benefits of mindfulness this<br>research is frequently made up of<br>uncontrolled or inadequately controlled<br>studies they're frequently underpowered<br>short-term or single session pre post<br>studies and they're actually quite prone<br>to self selection biases so if you're<br>familiar with the Gartner hype cycle<br>which is typically used in marketing to<br>describe the pattern for new<br>technologies and has also comically been<br>adapted to describe the lifespan of<br>scientific research the going body of<br>mindfulness research seems to fall about<br>here and over perhaps the last two years<br>mindfulness research has been teetering<br>at the top of this peak and researchers<br>are beginning to take a more critical<br>approach to delivering assessing and<br>recommending mindfulness as a treatment<br>option for mental health they're also<br>beginning to publish articles about<br>potential negative effects of mine<br>Vaness possible contraindications for<br>mindfulness publication biases in the<br>research and making stronger suggestions<br>for how to conduct mindfulness research<br>all over and as of about a fortnight ago<br>I believe we actually have our first<br>published known results so this all<br>suggests we're actually heading toward<br>the trough of disillusionment concerning<br>Lee when we look at mindfulness<br>meditation apps many of the health<br>benefits touted by these apps are based<br>on mindfulness practice in general<br>rather than on act based mindfulness<br>given the fast paced nature of the app<br>industry and the inherent financial<br>motives of this industry there's a<br>deficit in the empirical mobile<br>mindfulness research despite there being<br>over 1,300 mindfulness apps available in<br>app stores there are actually only a<br>handful of published studies on<br>mindfulness meditation many of which<br>suffer the same fatal flaws as previous<br>research in addition the snail pace at<br>which academic publishing occurs means<br>that by the time a group of researchers<br>actually published a review of mobile<br>mindfulness research all five of the<br>evidence supported apps were no longer<br>available in the app stores and it<br>really is a shame because apps have so<br>much potential as thunks a health and<br>well-being tool but also as a research<br>tool app platforms really lend<br>themselves well it's a critical<br>evaluation because the degree of<br>standardization that can be achieved on<br>an app far surpasses that which is<br>available with face-to-face intervention<br>and smartphone users only growing if we<br>look to New Zealand in particular the<br>majority of adults aged 18 to 34 owned a<br>smartphone and they use it daily if we<br>look a little further abroad smartphones<br>are the preferred method of contact by<br>young people and this population is also<br>less likely to seek or receive help for<br>their mental health if we look a little<br>bit closer to home one third of a<br>surveyed population of University of<br>Otago students I think it was fourteen<br>hundred and forty of us scored above the<br>threshold for significant symptoms of<br>depression so these factors all suggests<br>that perhaps young adults might be an<br>optimal population to trial mindfulness<br>meditation but the ultimate question is<br>if you put mindfulness mobile<br>mindfulness meditation under the<br>magnifying glass does it work and given<br>its deviation from a lifelong Buddhist<br>practice how much mindfulness can you<br>really squeeze into a 10-minute session<br>I'm gonna give you a bit of a spoiler<br>alert I can't actually give you an<br>unequivocal answer on this one we as<br>research have researchers have to be<br>extremely cautious about accepting the<br>null or supporting the alternate<br>hypotheses based on such a small number<br>of trials and we just don't have enough<br>literature and mobile mindfulness to<br>give you that answer but what I can do<br>is tell you a little bit about what<br>we've been doing in this arena how we're<br>contributing to mobile mindfulness<br>so to answer these questions we asked<br>three randomized groups of people to use<br>one of three apps mindfulness app one<br>which costs money after a brief free<br>trial an attention control app that was<br>free but you could pay for extras<br>mindfulness at two which is entirely<br>free we made sure to choose apps that<br>had gained popularity so at one has over<br>a million users and I believe at two has<br>several hundred thousand users because<br>we really wanted the apps that were<br>already relatively polished mostly<br>because I didn't want them to disappear<br>off the app store before I'd even<br>managed to finish the trial so we<br>surveyed everyone at the outset of the<br>study before asking them to complete a<br>brief 10-minute session on their app<br>every day for ten days during these ten<br>days we sent them a text message every<br>day at 7 p.m. with the URL to a brief<br>daily survey and after the 10 day trial<br>we asked them to complete a second<br>survey before we gave them open access<br>for another 30 days so we really wanted<br>to try and mimic a little bit more<br>naturalistic use with this and at each<br>of these time points we had several<br>important measures that feature that<br>have featured heavily in previous<br>research including measures of<br>depression stress anxiety resilience<br>flourishing and then of course<br>mindfulness so what did we actually find<br>well first off it's important to note<br>that there was extremely high adherence<br>during the 10 day trial on average<br>people use their app on nine out of<br>those ten days but this really wasn't<br>the case for the 30 day open access<br>where approximately half of all<br>participants did not use their app a<br>single time even so these apps receive<br>pretty good acceptability ratings which<br>was a combination of perceived<br>usefulness and effectiveness at each<br>time point and because we're interested<br>in quite a few outcome measures to most<br>easily illustrate change over time<br>I'm just going to run you through some<br>basic paired t-tests so what we see here<br>is that app users at one users showed<br>improvements and symptoms of depression<br>stress anxiety mindfulness and<br>resilience with no change in flourishing<br>across the first 10 days of the study<br>our mindfulness app to users also showed<br>some improvements in depression and<br>anxiety and resilience but no changes in<br>stress mindfulness and flourishing and<br>you'll notice that bar a small reduction<br>in stress the control app who also<br>self-reported very high usership made no<br>significant improvements in any of the<br>categories and actually slightly<br>worsened and depressive symptoms and<br>flourishing when we look from baseline<br>to the end of the 40-day study you'll<br>see that at one users still show<br>significant improvements and stress<br>anxiety mindfulness and resilience<br>despite the fact that over 40 percent of<br>these users did not use the app during<br>that 30 days I which I will also admit<br>entirely broke my heart because I did<br>spend the majority of my budget buying<br>one month access codes for that study<br>app to users by contrast only shows<br>small improvements and reduction during<br>that time period and yet again no<br>significant improvement in any outcomes<br>for the control group so we wanted to<br>look a little bit deeper delve further<br>to tear apart these relationships and<br>what have we find well if we dummy codes<br>so that our control app is a comparator<br>we can see that both mindfulness act<br>user users report significantly lower<br>depressive symptoms at time to compare<br>to the control group app to users report<br>greater resilience and only app1 users<br>report greater mindfulness so what gives<br>both of these apps are actually<br>presenting very very say me<br>mindfulness content they're both focused<br>on open monitoring and focus focus<br>attention using mindful breathing and<br>body scan meditation so why are they<br>showing such different outcomes so I<br>wanted to check that they actually were<br>different from one another and when I<br>recode so that app 1 is our comparator<br>we do see that there is a significant<br>difference in mindfulness between these<br>two groups but not at the time 3 so I'm<br>just going to jump back to the control<br>group as a comparator and then look at<br>our at our end of study our outcomes and<br>what we see is that our two mindfulness<br>at groups still show significant<br>reductions in depression one at one of<br>our app groups shows improvements in<br>anxiety and the other shows improvements<br>in resilience and these improvements at<br>times vary a particularly impressive<br>given that almost half of these<br>participants did not use the apps during<br>this time at all which leads me to my<br>final fact when we did some some<br>moderation analyses we found that there<br>was a bit of a dose-response<br>relationship between mindfulness abuse<br>and mental health improvement that is<br>those who use the app most frequently<br>during the optional use phase reach the<br>greatest rewards in terms of their<br>depression symptoms anxiety and<br>mindfulness so where to from here well<br>as always further research but I'm<br>particularly interested in exploring the<br>mobile mindfulness and depression line a<br>little further we've recently completed<br>a study through with Jean how services<br>counseling service because I'm<br>interested in the possibility that<br>perhaps<br>these could be used as homework tools in<br>the counseling service as an adjunct to<br>treatment as usual and then the other<br>area of interest is mindfulness and<br>building resilience so we have also run<br>recently conducted a large-scale at uh<br>Turner and Carrington looking at<br>building resilience when people first<br>start University<br>so my take-home messages<br>I think mindfulness can be delivered<br>Moberly and it may have some short-term<br>benefits but I don't think it's a<br>magical band-aid but it's definitely a<br>good start and I don't think that we<br>should consider all technology to be a<br>bad thing especially because it's<br>probably not going away thank you very<br>will start again<br>sure thing nobody's jumping up and down<br>I mean clearly that looks like there's a<br>difference between f1 and there yes<br>what's the difference well I've actually<br>gotta look hangfire so we actually<br>conducted a bunch of focus groups<br>because we were like what is going on<br>here<br>so we invited all 210 people to take<br>part in focus groups we managed to get<br>seven focus groups in total five of<br>these groups were with mindfulness app<br>users and it represented about just over<br>15% of our overall sample and we had<br>several major questions that we wanted<br>to understand what did they think about<br>it did they think it was useful what<br>were the barriers that stops them and<br>what did they like and dislike and then<br>we wanted to look at how these differed<br>between the two between the apps and so<br>across the board there was a resounding<br>yes from all directions and mobile<br>mindfulness helped but interesting<br>interestingly that didn't relate to<br>uptake it was considered a good thing to<br>do if you were feeling groggy<br>or struggling to focus your mind or your<br>mind was raced racing a mile a minute<br>participants felt that it helped with<br>this studying to clear their heads or<br>have to help revitalize them so they<br>could put in a few extra hours of study<br>per day it also really this concept of<br>conflict resolution through mood change<br>came up multiple times with both groups<br>and then the barriers were social stigma<br>and preconceptions and needing time and<br>needing to add it into your routine and<br>and not having enough time for it which<br>was the same across both apps this<br>participant discussed how it's weird or<br>creepy that you're alone in your room<br>and some guys talking to you and<br>participants who hadn't incorporated it<br>into their routine felt like they just<br>but when they did do it they didn't<br>regret it I think it's like a workout<br>you never regret it once you've done it<br>but you still can't be bothered to do it<br>so this is where this is where the<br>difference came looks appearances<br>gamification and technical difficulties<br>so despite everything my mother has told<br>me while growing up if there's one thing<br>that I could take away from the series<br>of focus groups that could apply to<br>other at bay Serapis it's that looks<br>really matter app one was considered<br>sleek and beautiful and easy to use<br>and unfortunately the app too we got a<br>lot of complaints about technical<br>difficulties glitchyness appearance<br>participant 3 above here wasn't even<br>able to actually download the app onto<br>their own personal phone and had to do<br>it on somebody else's so I think that it<br>was app specific differences not one<br>participant actually said something<br>along the lines of and I'm paraphrasing<br>it's really hard to be mindful when your<br>phone is pissing you off okay that's<br>good my second question will come<br>through it was did you when they report<br>using<br>how many are using it in the middle of<br>the night you know when will stuff<br>itself may interfere with your sleep so<br>and not many are using it in the middle<br>of the night but lots are using it to go<br>to sleep lots are using it to help them<br>go to sleep do they have to look at it<br>then no you don't look at it okay okay<br>this answers my question you had a<br>question after your research<br>are you considering developing your own<br>it<br>no because it's really hard it takes a<br>long time the edge II um<br>looking at your I'm not interested in<br>whether there were differences in your<br>groups it baseline no there wasn't<br>so we needed your T tests you there was<br>no baseline measures we the same no you<br>control from your admission yeah it's<br>alright so basically the two groups<br>they're homogeneous mollies okay I think<br>hi I'm a person who doesn't believe in<br>technology almost at all<br>and I don't actually understand why<br>these people are so additive to the<br>phones myself I don't know<br>and always want to trade our phones away<br>you have to act it out to the phones<br>okay my question is these people your<br>participants have this expectation that<br>the technology will actually help them<br>mentally did have this expectation<br>already in mind before they took on this<br>research I believe so<br>by virtue of taking part in this study<br>it probably was a little bit implied but<br>that's why we had our control condition<br>to and the control condition was also it<br>was it's not the best of the control<br>little bit of deception though some<br>goals whereby participants were told<br>that they were also trialing something<br>that was potentially going to be good<br>for them to do you do you plan to do<br>some other comparison I asked them to at<br>least go out for a walk to see the real<br>world and to compare it with effect from<br>diesel applications well there is<br>research in our lab that does that but<br>what we have done instead is because we<br>want to compare it to other mindfulness<br>we have also recently<br>try well haven't done all of the<br>analyses yet but replicated the same<br>study but one of the conditions was was<br>an internet-based<br>mindfulness like on your on your<br>computer rather than on the phone I'd<br>say another good but probably more<br>difficult step would be to have like a<br>face-to-face group based but then we'd<br>also have have some some sweet sweet<br>group social interaction fictions thank<br>you very much because for myself going<br>out for walk is definitely more<br>effective than using the phone I just a<br>question you mentioned in the beginning<br>of you talk that you've um there's<br>currently research is being done that<br>demonstrates a negative effect of<br>mindfulness yeah did you give an example<br>something you think it's credible um so<br>there isn't a huge amount of this<br>research actually published there is a<br>an epidemic at Brown University who has<br>been working on publishing this it's<br>mostly case studies at the moment but I<br>believe that there is a lot of evidence<br>the contraindications the certain mental<br>health diagnosis yeah<br>which mental health conditions um oh<br>gosh I believe that sometimes people<br>with severe anxiety don't actually do<br>very well with mindfulness in OCD you<br>might never stop it maybe but then also<br>I believe that there might be some<br>contraindications for people that<br>experience psychosis is one yep yeah<br>well cause um this is outside your study<br>but I'm interested you mentioned at the<br>beginning about the age group that is<br>reluctant they're less likely to seek<br>help<br>mhm what are the reasons for that oh I<br>don't know and because I'm interested in<br>the idea of here one is interacting with<br>you know either disembodied voice on the<br>end it's not relational thank you about<br>the social connection and identity that<br>we heard about seems odd because I<br>thought that young age group was would<br>more gravitate to human face to face<br>type of help particularly because it'd<br>been so many campaigns John Kirwan and<br>all making it okay mm-hmm um I mean I I<br>don't actually I don't really know but I<br>would hazard a guess that convenience<br>really factors into this and then also<br>the cost of accessing health care is a<br>little bit prohibitive for some people<br>particularly younger people who don't<br>typically earn that much money yeah<br>thank you maybe the last question<br>pression I don't know if you'll be able<br>to answer this one but I am curious is<br>there a something that mindfulness is<br>actually doing to make it easier to<br>confront your difficult problems and<br>feel better about it or is it that<br>you're just associating the problem with<br>a peaceful state of mind compared to an<br>anxious state of mind that's a difficult<br>question because the state of the<br>literature at the moment is kind of<br>fighting over what how they think<br>mindfulness actually works so when I<br>gave the examples of open monitoring and<br>focused attention mm-hmm<br>it was it was it's kind of in the same<br>vein as there's a lot of CBT the way CBT<br>works I think kind of like training<br>okay look time is going some of us have<br>to go home and join our social groups so<br>thank you very much the two presenters<br>it's been a fascinating early evening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
