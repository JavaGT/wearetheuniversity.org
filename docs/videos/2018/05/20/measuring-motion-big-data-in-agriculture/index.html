We chat with Dr Lee Streeter about his Marsden Fast Start and MBIE Smart ideas funded research project that looks at how to accurately measure motion and reduce motion blur using time-of-flight photography.     Dr Streeter will have cameras on stand this year’s event, come and visit us in the Pavilion.
