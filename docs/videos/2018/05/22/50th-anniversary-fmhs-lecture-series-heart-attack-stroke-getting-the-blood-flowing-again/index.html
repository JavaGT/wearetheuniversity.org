Norman sharp I<br>just like to welcome you to this this is<br>our second public lecture and our 50th<br>anniversary lecture series great<br>provocative title heart attacks and<br>Stroke getting the blood flowing again<br>so that sounds pretty good as you all<br>know how the Texas strokes are two of<br>the major causes of death and disability<br>in our community great challenge and<br>tonight we've got three of New Zealand's<br>preeminent experts in this area and<br>they're going to describe how these<br>diseases develop and how they contribute<br>to health and then they will move on to<br>describe the recent huge advances of<br>medical technology and use how the<br>medical technologies use various<br>techniques to restore blood flow and to<br>get the heart and brain working again<br>pretty good so these developments have<br>actually transformed the management of<br>strokes and heart attacks and throw up<br>significant logistical challenges how<br>we're going to roll this out right<br>across the country and they'll touch on<br>that I'm sure so it's really important<br>that we acknowledge the the support and<br>in the partnership that these these<br>lectures are presented with and partners<br>with the Auckland medical research<br>foundation and just before I asked<br>Norman sharp to introduce our first<br>speaker you know sue Brewster who's the<br>executive director of the author medical<br>research foundation just to say a few<br>words<br>sue well thank you very much sir Richard<br>and it is my pleasure to reinforce<br>professor falls welcome to everyone here<br>tonight and to our Auckland medical<br>research foundation guests and<br>supporters that come along to our public<br>lectures every year and and some of you<br>will also be new here tonight<br>so the first in the lecture series was<br>held last month and yes our public<br>lectures this year in 2018 are a little<br>bit different this year we have the<br>privilege of partnering with the<br>magnificent technically a beautiful and<br>health<br>in celebration of their 50th year<br>anniversary so over the last 63 years<br>Auckland Medical Research Foundation has<br>provided significant funding into<br>cardiovascular research I think we've<br>funded research from the pioneering days<br>of heart transplants and bypass<br>surgeries right through to the modern<br>day projects of technology assisted<br>cardiac rehabilitation anything's<br>possible<br>but we couldn't do this without the<br>support of our amazing people who donate<br>the money to fund our world-class<br>medical research<br>this funding literally provides the<br>heart beat and there is no pun intended<br>for extraordinary researchers many of<br>them who work here at the Faculty of<br>medical and Health Sciences these<br>researchers work tirelessly to undertake<br>their life-changing research and provide<br>the genuine advances and medicine and<br>health that benefit us all I'd like to<br>acknowledge the outstanding caliber of<br>our presenters here tonight and I'm sure<br>we're all going to learn a lot so and<br>closing please do take the two minutes<br>that'll take to fill out your feedback<br>forms that are in the folders so we can<br>continue to deliver all that's important<br>to you I hope you enjoy tonight's<br>presentations and leave here with<br>increased knowledge not only of heart<br>attacks and strokes but also under how<br>to get that blood flowing again thank<br>you very much and enjoy<br>good evening and welcome what a<br>fantastic turnout as I came in the door<br>tonight some bright spark who knew me<br>from my former life said ah norm they've<br>brought you off the bench again knowing<br>I'm a basketball fan The Breakers fan<br>and you know what coming off the bench<br>me does is know mate they've taken me<br>off the shelf Here I am it's great to be<br>with you and what a fantastic attendance<br>I think that in and of itself speaks so<br>strongly to the the community of the<br>medical school in the broader sense in<br>Auckland at the outset I'd like to<br>actually acknowledge the founding<br>members of the medical school in this<br>fiftieth year many of whom I knew well<br>working in Auckland as the young doctor<br>at the time having graduated from that<br>Southern School in 1968 I think it would<br>be not unkind to call them collectively<br>a white-coated hierarchical but lively<br>Bunch<br>which they were it was very much a<br>former era in medicine as you may<br>reflect but I do recall in the precinct<br>here between the hospital and the<br>medical school the sense of excitement<br>with the first intake of 60 students and<br>so on and so forth and the traffic<br>building up across the road back and<br>forth and I think if any of the<br>foundation professors were here in the<br>fiftieth year they would be very well<br>pleased with what they saw we should<br>acknowledge them and thank them also I'd<br>like to briefly pay a tribute to jiff<br>Tatsu Brewster and the a MRF more than<br>60 million dollars invested and medical<br>research in Auckland since the 1950s<br>since their inception an absolutely<br>fantastic contribution and I think this<br>in and of itself is a major factor or<br>has been a major factor in securing the<br>school's current solid international<br>reputation<br>finally by way of introduction<br>I have to mention the Hart Foundation<br>and it happens to be the Hart<br>foundations 50th anniversary year this<br>year too the foundation being<br>constituted in 1968 it was first<br>suggested by the Oakland grandfather of<br>clinical cardiology Jim Lowe taken up by<br>colleagues and the main centers medical<br>and business people I knew many of them<br>and through their vision and generosity<br>of spirit like just as with the Amr if<br>the Hart Foundation came into being and<br>I think if I could mention one person<br>that vision and generosity of spirit was<br>epitomized in Oakland by David Cole a<br>cardiothoracic surgeon who was the<br>second Dean of the school for many years<br>a wonderful man of course in the 1960s<br>currently heart disease was epidemic<br>people were dying in the 40s and 50s<br>frequently it was not uncommon and since<br>then currently heart disease death rates<br>have gone down by about three quarters<br>as a result of education prevention and<br>a revolution and clinical care the aims<br>of the foundation from the outset were<br>to support research education and and<br>more laterally actually patient support<br>on a national basis and the foundation<br>has invested more than 65 million in<br>research this is in heart research<br>nationally biomedical clinical and<br>public health and this is in projects<br>and people as the armor if does so well<br>the fellowships in particular I think<br>have been the Forte of the Heart<br>Foundation and there are two endowed<br>chairs one in Christchurch and one in<br>Auckland the first chair and categories<br>was endowed in 1987 some and the<br>audience will remember professor Fulham<br>lover who took that chair as the<br>inaugural chair is now held in<br>Christchurch by Mark Richards a former<br>Heart Foundation senior fellow who has<br>grown and developed his team efforts and<br>he now directs the Christchurch Heart<br>Institute which is a world-class<br>research program benched<br>site and into the community the second<br>chair is with us tonight in the form of<br>professor Rob Doughty the chair and<br>heart health<br>Rob too was a former Heart Foundation<br>senior fellow appointed to the chair in<br>2011 and leading a developing leading<br>abroad program again across the borders<br>that were encompassing basic clinical<br>and community-based research so without<br>further ado I'll ask Rob to take us<br>ahead and tell us about heart attacks<br>and strokes Rob well thank you Norman<br>Richard sue Dean ladies and gentlemen<br>good evening and it really is my<br>pleasure to be here to talk with you<br>this evening and my title is is very<br>simple so I've got the simple bit and I<br>was told to make this light-hearted just<br>now so I'm gonna have to rewrite my<br>whole talk but I'm gonna talk to you<br>about what these things are heart<br>attacks and strokes I'm gonna start<br>pretty basic your heart pumps blood<br>around your body as you know through<br>your arteries and veins and it delivers<br>to our bodies the blood and nutrients<br>and the oxygen that all of the tissues<br>in our body needs so we're gonna be<br>talking about major places in the body<br>supplied by some pretty important blood<br>vessels and you'll hear about the<br>treatments that we're going to talk<br>about in the minute we term medically<br>return those conditions cardiovascular<br>disease and the main focus of the<br>clinical events we're talking about our<br>heart attacks and strokes as you know<br>them so as we're sitting here we're<br>talking about the heart and your heart<br>is quietly working away there so here's<br>a beautiful image of the heart this is<br>reconstructed from cardiac MRI imaging<br>of the heart provided to me here by<br>professor professor Martin Nash and his<br>colleagues at the Auckland bio<br>engineering Institute at this university<br>really illustrating some of the<br>technology we have to work with to<br>understand how the heart actually works<br>so while we sit here for the next 90<br>minutes your heart is going to beat more<br>than 6,000 times so in a room this size<br>we're going to share between us more<br>than<br>point two million heartbeats while<br>you're thinking about that I'll carry on<br>talking so it can be argued that we<br>really live in very fortunate times as<br>Norman's already mentioned we've seen a<br>seventy-five to eighty percent reduction<br>in the risk of dying from heart disease<br>and stroke over the last 50 years a<br>really remarkable story over what is a<br>relatively short period of time of<br>improving risk factors and advancing of<br>treatment we can also think ourselves<br>fortunate we live in a country with a<br>publicly funded health care system and<br>I'm not going to answer questions on<br>that one we have incredible teams who<br>are dedicated to delivering the very<br>best in health care and many of you in<br>this room may have experienced or been<br>touched by some components either for<br>you and your families for that health<br>care we have researchers of<br>international standing locally here at<br>the University of Auckland and in all<br>areas from public health through to<br>basic science the expert clinicians and<br>their teams both in the hospitals and<br>the communities in this region really<br>are again of international standing and<br>we have similar similar clinical and<br>academic excellence across the whole<br>country so we are in very fortunate<br>times I think I'm going to set the scene<br>really in the next few minutes and for<br>what you'll hear in relation to<br>treatments and the advances of<br>treatments and for these common<br>conditions heart attacks and strokes<br>before I do that I'm going to take you<br>back in time a little bit so it's always<br>nice to go back it's the 50th<br>anniversary so we can look back a little<br>bit and for those of you who like<br>history then Dwight Eisenhower you'll be<br>very familiar I'm sure he was the<br>commander General at the Allied forces<br>in Europe during the Second World War<br>and he was elected as the 34:30 fourth<br>President of the United States in 1952<br>at the age of 62 on the 25th September<br>1955 he was playing golf in Cherry Hills<br>Country Club if you have a look at it's<br>very nice place and he experienced some<br>symptoms of discomfort in his chest he<br>was attended to by his personal<br>physician dr. Schneider and dr.<br>Schneider stayed with the president<br>overnight<br>a number of drugs including some<br>morphing and if you're interested there<br>is a side story about dr. Schneider the<br>personal physician and when you touch<br>into that story what I take away from it<br>is I never ever want to be a personal<br>physician to a president of the United<br>States there's a lot written about this<br>gentleman 12 hours later recognized this<br>man was not doing quite as well he was<br>taken to hospital an ECG was delivered<br>into the hospital from somewhere else<br>and that is a device that just simply<br>records the heartbeat electrically you<br>can now record that on your mobile phone<br>and a heart attack was diagnosed at that<br>point 12 hours later and you're going to<br>hear from others about potential delays<br>in treatment delay in presentation delay<br>in treatment he was treated in an oxygen<br>tent initially instead spent six weeks<br>in hospital and we don't even know to<br>this day and where the oxygen is a good<br>thing to give to people with a heart<br>attack or not at that point now the<br>impact of this was huge so in that era<br>there was being a lot of strife over<br>many decades and the day after the<br>president's heart attack was the worst<br>day in trading on Wall Street since the<br>end of the Second World War the Dow<br>Jones fell six percent 14 billion<br>dollars was wiped off the the sheer<br>market at that point simply wide one<br>person's heart attack one event the<br>president did survive his heart attack<br>as I'm sure you're all aware he went on<br>to have a stroke two years later we're<br>gonna hear about heart attacks and<br>strokes more as we progress the next few<br>minutes and he survived another seven<br>heart attacks he survived 14 cardiac<br>arrests until he finally died at the age<br>of 78 in 1969 so quite a story for one<br>person who's been touched by<br>cardiovascular disease and you'll<br>probably note that most heart attacks<br>are not followed by the same impact on<br>the share market as this one was<br>we'll also just pause and go back a<br>little bit to that era because that<br>really is an era where heart disease<br>management was starting to change and<br>we're going to talk about this again a<br>little bit as we go through but as<br>you'll be aware people with heart<br>disease people with heart attacks may<br>die suddenly and they may die very<br>quickly from that problem and they die<br>because their heart stops beating as we<br>call it ventricular fibrillation the<br>treatment and management of which is<br>resuscitation and defibrillation so the<br>first successful resuscitation of a<br>patient was undertaken in 1950 1953 and<br>dr. Zola whose name persists associated<br>with defibrillation 50 years on from<br>there undertook the first external<br>defibrillation of a patient in 1956 a<br>British cardiologist we have to get back<br>to Britain at some point<br>Desmond Julianne recognized around that<br>point and presented at the British<br>thoracic society the need for monitoring<br>of patients and the need for monitoring<br>very closely of people who are having a<br>heart attack and who were presenting to<br>hospital and a need for resuscitation if<br>the heart rhythm becomes a dangerous<br>heart rhythm and this was published and<br>a year later in Kansas City in Bethany<br>Hospital an 11 bed unit funded by<br>private donations I mean New York<br>Foundation was opened as the first<br>coronary care unit as it was recognized<br>at the time and coronary care units as<br>I'm sure you're all aware a fundamental<br>part of heart attack management in all<br>of our hospitals in the world and dr. HW<br>day in the early 70s in a paper perhaps<br>this quote from the end of his paper<br>really sums up that era that the 60s had<br>been the era of the cardiologists with<br>the defibrillator in his hand I won't go<br>into the wording of this obviously I'd<br>argue that actually probably it was in<br>other people's hands and probably the<br>nurses in the coronary care units<br>overnight actually - but it was a point<br>the pointers it was resuscitation era it<br>was early development of of of advanced<br>care and resuscitation so very basic<br>here but this is 50 years ago<br>and you'll hear other<br>as we progress come back to the themes<br>that that are still there and still<br>present and for how we treat people with<br>heart disease it is the 50th anniversary<br>so let's go back to 1968 so this is an<br>extract from the New Zealand yearbook<br>from 1968 and that was then the New<br>Zealand population of 2.7 million people<br>and this is a figure there I think this<br>was a hand drawn figure rather than some<br>fancy Excel or other program plot of<br>showing that the major causes of death<br>in that era of heart disease and<br>cerebral hemorrhage cancer up there as<br>well but the major causes of death<br>identified at that stage even 50 years<br>ago the population was different as well<br>so here our population graphs of 1968<br>with the different decades of our age<br>and how that's changed you can see<br>visually there with the baby boomer<br>population now moving through<br>middle-aged and also the advancing age<br>of our population so not uncommonly<br>people surviving through into their 90's<br>or the hundreds and still experiencing<br>cardiovascular disease and all the<br>challenges of management for people of<br>advanced age so a lot has changed a lot<br>is the same but a lot has changed over<br>that 50 years that we're talking about<br>so I'm going to talk a little bit now<br>about what heart attacks are I'm going<br>to talk about the potential causes which<br>hopefully will round this up and lead<br>into some of the advances in treatment<br>so we're talking about blood vessels<br>we're talking about blood vessels<br>blocking and those arteries blocking<br>affecting the major organs in our body<br>and the the clinical effects from those<br>problems we need to understand those<br>blood bills blood vessels a little bit<br>more and to understand why these<br>processes happen and this is a thorough<br>sclerosis and I'm sure you're all very<br>familiar with this process lots of<br>different terminology as we have in<br>medicine medicine loves to have four or<br>five names for the same thing and we all<br>choose to use them in a different way at<br>the time but atherosclerosis plaque in<br>your arteries hardening of the arteries<br>whatever you like to call it<br>and there on this illustration here on<br>the left hand is the illustration of an<br>artery could be any artery in the body<br>but there's the part laid and deposits<br>building up in the wall of the artery<br>you need to consider this over a<br>lifetime<br>this is doesn't develop over weeks or<br>days this is a process developing over a<br>lifetime and I'll come back to that<br>theme in a minute and this will<br>progressively potentially narrow an<br>artery and this can affect a number of<br>different places in our body so it<br>affects our heart and our brain we're<br>talking about that today heart attack<br>some strokes it affects other areas in<br>the body as well it affects our legs<br>from the point of view of the<br>circulation to the legs it affects our<br>gut and that's often forgotten about<br>that can cause substantial symptoms for<br>people and it affects our kidneys and<br>kidney problems in kidney failure<br>remained to be an important problem<br>these all develop all of this<br>atherosclerosis devups on the background<br>of risk factors over a lifetime of<br>exposure and probably before were<br>actually born so let's think about the<br>heart for a moment a heart attack so<br>here's a CT scan these are images to<br>derive from a simple x-ray very fast<br>x-ray taken with no catheters inside the<br>body these images provided to me by my<br>colleague associate professor Malcolm<br>Leggett on the left there is the heart<br>with the coronary arteries running<br>around the outside of the heart and then<br>with rendering of that image the heart<br>itself is removed on the right hand side<br>not from the patient but from the image<br>leaving the coronary arteries for you to<br>see there and you can see they're very<br>small<br>these are arteries only a few<br>millimeters in diameter but as I've<br>talked about they're doing that function<br>of supply the nutrients to the heart<br>muscle every single time the heart<br>muscle beat so it's no wonder that we'd<br>run into a problem when one of those<br>blocks and so they do block and these<br>arteries block at the site of one of<br>those narrowings most commonly so in the<br>heart of heart attack is caused where<br>the artery inside is rough and friable<br>and blood clot forms at the site of that<br>plaque in the coronary<br>and the blood clot then forms to block<br>the artery this is a sudden event and if<br>you talk to people who have had a heart<br>attack it's often out of the blue so it<br>doesn't come with warning symptoms over<br>weeks or months it will happen out of<br>the blue the situation with the stroke<br>also relates to blood whether to blood<br>vessels and to blood clots and for some<br>of those as you'll hear from Professor<br>barber those blood clots come from other<br>places in the body to lodge and to block<br>in a crucial artery supplying the blood<br>to the brain causing a stroke so do<br>these heart attacks and strokes matter<br>well let's step back and think from a<br>global perspective first of all they do<br>matter so the World Health Organization<br>as I'm sure again you're very familiar<br>talks of non communicable diseases now<br>as being our major challenges ahead and<br>has done for some time this is<br>cardiovascular disease this is cancer<br>this is respiratory disease and diabetes<br>and cardiovascular disease lumping<br>together heart attacks and strokes is a<br>major cause of death around the world so<br>you can pluck all sorts of figures about<br>18 million people dying a year from<br>cardiovascular disease or one heart<br>attack and one stroke occurring every 40<br>seconds so don't know how long I've been<br>talking for but already we're clocking<br>through the heart attacks and strokes as<br>we're talking today in the United States<br>one in three people die of<br>cardiovascular disease it's also<br>important to remember we shouldn't just<br>be focusing on the death rates from<br>these problems people survive and live<br>with heart disease and survive and live<br>with the sequela of a stroke and so for<br>example here it's estimated that more<br>than 90 million people in America alone<br>are living with heart disease and for<br>the years ahead so very important<br>implications in relation to patients so<br>does it matter in New Zealand yes it<br>does matter but this is the great news<br>story which we've already mentioned the<br>substantial reduction in the death rates<br>from heart disease and stroke over the<br>last 50 years so the peak in those<br>graphs the peak in the graphs is in the<br>late 1960s so that is 50 years ago so<br>it's quite appropriate to be talking<br>about this on a 50th anniversary so it<br>is an epidemic as<br>has already mentioned and high smoking<br>rates risk factor management all<br>evolving and then changing over that<br>time resulting in these substantial<br>reductions in the risk of dying of these<br>two common problems in the last 50 years<br>fantastic great news incredibly<br>important but there is a lot more to<br>understand and a lot more to be done for<br>these two common two conditions so it is<br>still highly relevant in New Zealand<br>heart of heart disease and strokes there<br>they're the second and third leading<br>cause for why any of us in New Zealand<br>will die incredibly important and that's<br>following on from all cancers lumped<br>together you can see the numbers there<br>for the estimate of the number of people<br>living in New Zealand with heart disease<br>and living with the effects and<br>disability of a stroke so there's a<br>large number of people in our population<br>living with the effects of these<br>conditions but let's think about things<br>a slightly different way as well and<br>heart disease and stroke account for<br>more than 10% of all illness disability<br>and premature death in our country so<br>again very very important identifiable<br>causes for disability and this is not<br>just a problem of older age it's often<br>still thought that are well heart<br>attacks are only what people affect<br>older people we're all going to die of<br>something anyway so really let's just<br>get on with thinking of other things<br>that's not the case at all so heart<br>attacks and Stroke affect younger people<br>so let's think of working-age people<br>below the age of say 65 so one in three<br>people with a heart attack are of<br>working age and one in four people with<br>a stroke so these are fitting people<br>perhaps in their prime at their life<br>making huge contributions to their<br>family they're far know and to society<br>in general so the implications here are<br>broad and we could go on and talk about<br>that in great detail at another time we<br>need to consider the iniquity that is<br>still present in New Zealand and here<br>I've just selected to illustrate this<br>and the age of onset of these two common<br>conditions so you can see here that for<br>Maori and Pacific the average age of<br>onset<br>for a heart attack or stroke is<br>substantially less than for New Zealand<br>European people living in the country<br>right now and however you cut the<br>statistics however you look at it Maori<br>and Pacific people do much worse for<br>their heart disease stroke and as they<br>do for many other conditions and we need<br>to recognize this and obviously a lot of<br>work is going on and should go on to<br>address these inequities these problems<br>happen because of common risk factors<br>and these risk factors have been known<br>about for a long time but there's a<br>multitude of respecters it's right from<br>birth so it's the world we're born into<br>it's the families we're born into its<br>housing inequalities deprivation it's<br>our education and then it's personal<br>factors about us that we take through<br>our lifetime so this is a lifetime<br>concept in relation to cardiovascular<br>disease physical inactivity and you're<br>probably all now thinking right now of<br>your children or your grandchildren that<br>you're still telling to get off<br>PlayStation and go outside and be<br>physically active like you were poor<br>diet smoking these problems are still<br>very prevalent in our society how do we<br>deal with this though how do we<br>integrate all this information to<br>understand this this is a huge amount of<br>information for us to integrate<br>individually at any point in our life<br>course to understand what our potential<br>risk is and I really just want to pay a<br>tribute and acknowledgement to Professor<br>Roger axon at this university and his<br>wide team out in the University and<br>outside of the university who've been<br>involved in this work in relation to<br>understanding how to predict our risk of<br>heart disease by<br>integrating that information for us as<br>an individual it's getting to the level<br>of a precision medicine where we can<br>understand about us not just as a group<br>of people but us as an individual and<br>this is a publication from just last<br>week in in The Lancet of the data that's<br>been derived from 400,000 New Zealanders<br>this is decades of work in understanding<br>how we<br>actually predict who is going to be at<br>risk of developing a heart attack or a<br>stroke over the coming years the<br>challenge now is to implement this it's<br>to actually use this to actually<br>appropriately manage people or I risk<br>advise people and take this forward<br>through that life course and this as I<br>say this is decades of research this may<br>look relatively simple<br>this is decades of research huge amount<br>of funding funding and a very broad<br>research platform to be able to achieve<br>this kind of result that can now be used<br>in clinical practice we should talk a<br>little bit about good news so the New<br>Zealand Health Survey from the Ministry<br>of Health from last year has some good<br>news in it so all of you 80% of you you<br>can all just end up if you're one of<br>these addict sins eighty-eight percent<br>thought your health was good very good<br>or excellent when you answered the<br>health survey so that's pretty good<br>isn't it smoking rates are decreasing<br>that's pretty good too so we should<br>probably just stop here and then go home<br>and have dinner and pat ourselves on the<br>back but it's not all good news is it<br>and this sort of information is is<br>really crucial contemporary information<br>that we can take forward and do<br>something different with 600,000 adults<br>in New Zealand still smoke regularly 1.2<br>million adults in his enviro beasts and<br>that's a third of the adult population<br>and another third are overweight that's<br>two thirds of the population that are<br>overweight or obese a hundred thousand<br>children are obese and all these factors<br>as we put in that life course of disease<br>are incredibly important for the risk of<br>heart attacks and strokes if you look at<br>the richest homes that children are born<br>into maybe three percent of those<br>children will be abyss if you look at<br>the poorest homes at least 20 percent<br>will be obese so we live in difficult<br>times and a lot of difficult challenges<br>to grapple with this is from the front<br>cover of The Economist 15 years ago so<br>this isn't just from a few months ago<br>and we're still talking about the same<br>thing<br>I think really illustrates and captures<br>the attention very nicely and then<br>there's practical problems that really<br>are quite frightening<br>so in this survey when people answered<br>questions about picking up prescriptions<br>that we have to go to a pharmacy and pay<br>for the prescriptions or get to the<br>pharmacy to then pay for our<br>prescriptions a quarter of a million<br>adults didn't pick up a prescription<br>within the last year so they had sought<br>out healthcare for a problem that was<br>identified that was considered to need a<br>prescription of a drug a prescribed drug<br>and that's a quarter of a million adults<br>didn't pick up those prescriptions<br>that's pretty shocking and pretty bad<br>when you think of the long-term<br>implications of what that does so I'm<br>gonna finish just with symptoms and if<br>you bang your head tonight on the<br>cupboard before you go to sleep you're<br>gonna know what happened and your heads<br>gonna be sore if you catch your thumb in<br>the door your thumbs gonna be sore and<br>your thumb is gonna tell you that your<br>thumb saw heart attacks and strokes<br>don't work like that<br>it's difficult for people to recognize<br>that they may be having a heart attack<br>it's difficult for people to rationalize<br>what's going on and there's a multitude<br>of reasons why people may not recognize<br>and may not do something about those<br>symptoms and I just really want to pay a<br>tribute both to the Heart Foundation and<br>to the Stroke Foundation the major<br>initiatives for heart attack awareness<br>here Illustrated as I'm sure you've seen<br>with television adverts and posters very<br>very effective<br>television advertisements and some<br>lovely stories came through I think<br>almost immediately following those of<br>people who had responded because they'd<br>seen the advert so these sort of<br>activities make a difference and here<br>the fast acronym for recognizing the<br>signs and symptoms and signs of a stroke<br>and the common theme these are medical<br>emergencies you need to do something<br>about this this is not sitting around<br>for 12 hours with your personal<br>physician<br>your side overnight thinking that things<br>might get better you dial one one one<br>and you go to a hospital so I'm going to<br>end here and I would like though to pay<br>a tribute to all my colleagues my<br>academic colleagues and the Broad<br>University since the clinical colleagues<br>the public health physicians and the<br>many many patients who have contributed<br>to the research and that you'll hear a<br>little bit more about that's contained<br>within the data at some of the data I've<br>already presented we have a huge<br>willingness in New Zealand for people to<br>take part doing this for all sorts of<br>regions many of which are altruistic and<br>we live and should respect that and I<br>really do take my hat off to people<br>contributing to the research that goes<br>on I enjoy working in this field in this<br>country it's a challenge but I think<br>we're actually at a very very exciting<br>point you could say the 50 years each of<br>those points have been very exciting I<br>think we live in a very healthy<br>environment across the country to be<br>able to grapple with and address some of<br>these important issues<br>I will also thank the hyphenation Norman<br>has already mentioned this but I'd like<br>to extend a thanks to the Heart<br>Foundation really on behalf of everybody<br>who has benefited from the funding<br>that's 1,400 project grants individual<br>ideas that have made a difference it's<br>more than two hundred people being<br>touched by fellowships and all of those<br>then snowball and continue and that's a<br>lot of work and a lot of funding that<br>really has seen this through it's a team<br>effort and the Hart Foundation has been<br>part of that team for the last 50 years<br>also like to acknowledge the Met Oakland<br>Medical Research Foundation for the<br>funding to medical research in this<br>region and obviously for supporting the<br>series here thank you<br>to privilege to to introduce Jerry he's<br>a senior cardiologist in Waikato<br>Hospital and he's led unprecedented<br>improvement and clinical care in that<br>region which I would be so bold as to<br>suggest as perhaps the most challenging<br>geographically and demographically in<br>our small country he's the former chair<br>of our cardiac society and honorary<br>associate professor in the University of<br>Auckland and currently medical director<br>of the Heart Foundation and having heard<br>about heart attacks and strokes jerry<br>roll now tell us how we treat heart<br>attacks thank you I'm gonna talk not so<br>much for last 30 years with clot-busting<br>medicine and stents so I'm pleased to<br>see the neurologist to finally catch you<br>know if they're usually about 10 to 20<br>years behind what we do in cardiology<br>but our challenges in new zealand's how<br>we improve care for everyone in New<br>Zealand as Norman mentioned I work in<br>the Midland region it's a very<br>geographically diverse and challenging<br>area to deliver healthcare and we are<br>passionate about equity equity of care<br>for New Zealanders as Norman mentioned<br>and Rob mentioned as well this is the<br>50th anniversary of the Heart Foundation<br>as well formed in 1968 by Sir David Haye<br>and like-minded people at that stage<br>there was epidemic of heart disease in<br>New Zealand one on two New Zealanders<br>smoked 40% of our diet involves<br>saturated fats as part of our diet we've<br>had a dramatic reduction in<br>cardiovascular events skimming heart<br>disease death since then half half of<br>that<br>would you prevent that if measures and<br>half of novel treatments that we we know<br>have available to us in New Zealand Rob<br>took us through some of this but just to<br>emphasize but way back in the 1940s you<br>come in with a heart attack you may as<br>well toss the coin whether you survived<br>or not so if you survived the heart<br>attack you were likely to die of a clot<br>somewhere else due to prolonged bed rest<br>with the clock going to the lungs in<br>latter days in the 1980s we had the year<br>of clot-busting medicine and then we<br>started putting stents and in the 1990s<br>and some of the some of the pioneering<br>work that's informed what we've done<br>over the years has been supported by<br>Heart Foundation research in this new<br>zealand's some of Professor sharps work<br>looking at his inhibitors after a heart<br>attack and people with heart failure one<br>of my colleagues in Waikato dr. Krishnan<br>he in 1996 he came back to Waikato<br>having been in Florida on a Douglas<br>white fellowship where he learned<br>primary angioplasty and Waikato was the<br>first unit in the country we performed<br>primary angioplasty when something with<br>a heart attack 24 hours a day so again<br>supported by the Heart Foundation I want<br>to share with you to to patients and to<br>two slightly different stories Rose is a<br>71 year old lady who lives in Manukau<br>and Eddie is a 78 year old man who lives<br>in rural Taranaki and they both present<br>with chest pain with similar ECGs so<br>somebody want to have a one of the<br>physicians fellow but would you like to<br>interpret the ECG<br>okay okay and what would you be<br>considering at this stage okay yeah so<br>when we see people present with chespin<br>first question are we asking that's why<br>when you go to a doctor's surgery with<br>chest pain there's a sign up and all<br>doctor surgeries 3d departments please<br>come to the front the cute this is what<br>we want to know whether you're having<br>one of these events which is a large<br>heart attack where the artery one of the<br>arteries usually and a large vest and<br>the proximal vessels completely blocked<br>and that increases your risk not not<br>only of sudden death but also more<br>permanent damage that can lead to heart<br>failure so that's we want to want to<br>diagnose that quickly to get on with<br>strategies to try and open up the artery<br>to reduce the likelihood of sudden death<br>and also to preserve heart muscle in the<br>longer term the sooner we do this the<br>better and that's a picture of an artery<br>that's been explanted from someone who<br>had a heart attack but what you can see<br>here there's a lot of clot in the artery<br>that plaque is actually ruptured and<br>that actually would have been closed<br>completely and what we do know we are<br>much more likely to achieve benefit in<br>the longer term by opening up the artery<br>as soon as possible so the sooner we can<br>get on and make a diagnosis we can get<br>on and administer treatment to try and<br>open up the artery if we can put stenson<br>we should get on and do that and the<br>rationale behind that is we get greater<br>muscle Salvage so we're gonna open up<br>the artery but we're more likely to get<br>sustainable flow to the artery and<br>compared to clot-busting medicine that<br>results in less recurrent angina at less<br>heart attacks and we avoid the<br>life-threatening complications of some<br>of the clot-busting medicine that we<br>give in New Zealand this is one of the<br>complicated flow charts around what we<br>actually do so someone presents for<br>chest discomfort here what we want to do<br>is find out again make a diagnosis early<br>and if you can have an angioplasty or a<br>stent put in with 120 minutes from when<br>you first see someone a first medical<br>contact you should get on and put a<br>stent in however if that cannot be<br>achieved patient should not be denied<br>clot-busting medicine okay<br>so that's a really important thing for<br>us in our treatment paradigms and this<br>is similar we've got a similar diagram<br>flow chart for this in New Zealand but<br>this is the latest esc guidelines so<br>again 120 minutes is it sort of cut off<br>that we start considering should we be<br>if you can get from somewhere to<br>somewhere else that performs angioplasty<br>then 120 minutes then it's reasonable to<br>try to transfer that patient to the<br>angioplasty center if you cannot you<br>should not deny that patient cost in<br>medicine if we look at what we're doing<br>currently in New Zealand and this is<br>from truth this is from 2013 about one<br>of three New Zealanders receive<br>clot-busting medicine but 40% of New<br>Zealanders receive angioplasty but about<br>20% of New Zealanders receive no form of<br>treatment for a blocked artery when they<br>present with a big heart attack if you<br>receive no treatment you tend to do<br>worse self-explanatory you tend to these<br>patients tend to be more likely to be<br>females nursing home residents and if<br>they are admitted to hospital they tend<br>to not receive the same treatment on<br>discharge they do though you do not do<br>well if you do not receive either<br>clot-busting medicine or angioplasty so<br>getting back to our passions rolls her<br>pin onset was at 6 o'clock she drove<br>herself to bit more Hospital good idea<br>was transferred from Middlemore to<br>Auckland public arrived doc in public at<br>half past midnight that's her main<br>artery down the front of the heart it's<br>blocked high up and she gets the artery<br>opened up with the stent 7 a half hours<br>from symptom onset<br>what about Eddie so Eddie had two<br>previous heart attacks so he's he sort<br>of thinks he knows what's going on he<br>awakes at 12:50 with his chest<br>discomfort does one one one the<br>ambulance gets him pretty quickly at<br>1:40 a.m. he arrives at Taranaki<br>emergency department at 2:30 he gets<br>given his clot-busting medicine fairly<br>quickly at just after 3:00 a.m. two<br>hours 20 post symptom onset so again<br>getting Eddie from Taranaki to Waikato<br>which is the nearest angioplasty centre<br>that's not gonna happen within two hours<br>his treatments appropriate so you should<br>be given clot-busting medicine and we'll<br>talk about we'll just see how this<br>develops so again if we look at the<br>evidence around clot-busting medicine it<br>works it works well particularly if it's<br>given early but the risk is bleeding and<br>bleeding into the brain which is serious<br>and can occur enough to 1% of patients<br>that's the risk we expose people to when<br>we give Clark Poston medicine but again<br>we should not deny people with a serious<br>heart attack clot-busting medicine if<br>they cannot get to an angioplasty centre<br>within 100 within two hours so back to<br>Eddie it's 5:00 a.m.<br>he's got ongoing chest discomfort his<br>ECGs not changed much at all and he's<br>referred to us we get a phone call on a<br>typical foggy Waikato morning say can<br>you help so what<br>turn a key want to send him up to us to<br>consider an angioplasty at this stage so<br>he arrives at Waikato at 10 a.m. and<br>again the guidelines would say this is<br>the current at European guidelines once<br>you receive clot-busting medicine you<br>should be transferred to an angioplasty<br>center immediately okay so not sit<br>around and wait to see if the artery<br>opens up or if the artery does not open<br>up because we cannot predict that at all<br>well<br>and we know that approximately one in<br>three blocked arteries do not open up<br>after been given clot-busting medicine<br>laughs oh and that's a lot of clot in<br>that artery I don't think you became to<br>try to sucked out it so that artery<br>there is full of clot okay all the way<br>down there but this is Eddie's angiogram<br>so he comes to our cath lab arrives at<br>the 11:30 a.m. the next one and the<br>artery responsible for the heart attack<br>is standard and opened just before<br>midday so again if we look at what<br>happened to Eddie he arrived at the<br>scene the ambulance arrived taken to<br>hospital he's given the clot-busting<br>medicine he's transferred to Waikato<br>when things don't look as though they're<br>going well finally arrives at Waikato<br>and gets his artery opened up 11 hours<br>from first medical contact Phillip herb<br>we don't have any good probably not done<br>a lot of good if you think back to you<br>know the the myocardium and the time so<br>how might we improve time to treatment<br>so lots of efforts over many years have<br>gone into what happens when someone goes<br>through the front door trying to<br>streamline things we're now starting to<br>look at what happens down this end so<br>how can we improve getting patients to<br>recognize the symptoms sooner can we<br>bring the treatment forward to the<br>patient by that the ambulance could do<br>an ECG we've got that we've got the<br>technology know where an ECG can be done<br>on an ambulance sent to someone in the<br>emergency department a heart attack<br>diagnose and the decisions made about<br>giving treatment about stage whether<br>it's costing meds they don't go into an<br>we're able to collect data in New<br>Zealand about what's happening we're<br>fortunate we've got a large registry<br>that allows us to see what's happened to<br>people who come in with heart attacks to<br>suspected heart attacks across our<br>country and we're able to look at a<br>number of things and this is looking<br>here at time to giving clot-busting<br>medicine and what we can see here how<br>well this projects but were the<br>clot-busting medicine is given<br>pre-hospital gym it's it should be a<br>no-brainer<br>if you can give it in the ambulance it's<br>going to be given<br>you're gonna achieve the timelines and<br>the recommended time has been 30 minutes<br>I've to 60 minutes sooner well as you<br>can see there's a lot of variation still<br>and delivery of clot-busting medicine in<br>New Zealand rescue angioplasty is what<br>we talked about with that even sent to<br>us in Waikato you can see there's a lot<br>of variation here as well but the median<br>time was just over five hours to get in<br>the artery opened up so again the reason<br>I show this is just to emphasize the<br>importance of data if you don't measure<br>what you do you don't understand what we<br>can do to try and improve things it's<br>important that we do continue to collect<br>data and we can drill this down into<br>each region each hospitals of what's<br>going on locally so if we go back to<br>Eddy Eddy really should be transferred<br>immediately to a PCI capable Center<br>after commencing the clot busting<br>medication<br>we also need to look at developing<br>systems of care that support early<br>diagnosis and rule in treatment remember<br>I said about one in five people do not<br>get treatment when they present with a<br>heart attack we need to actually why is<br>that they'd understand why that is and<br>develop systems that support early<br>diagnosis and early treatment where<br>appropriate not everybody is going to be<br>eligible for treatment be it Club<br>posting medicine around you classical we<br>need to support that decision-making<br>earlier<br>and we now are fortunate we've come<br>together with some Jones the cardiac<br>Network which I also chair and the<br>cardiac society to develop a national<br>STEMI pathway that recognizes this and<br>recognizes the importance of getting<br>people from A to B quickly I'm making<br>the decision sooner rather than later so<br>again if you look at what we want to do<br>with any and what the pathway helped it<br>helps us to achieve we hope so again<br>that's how he was treated what we want<br>to do is make the decision to give us a<br>treatment when the ambulance picks them<br>up so can they get on and initiate<br>treatment in the ambulance yes no<br>there's no point in I'm going to turn a<br>key Taranaki is not a place we can do I<br>don't you pass the answer he should be<br>he should be transferred to an<br>angioplasty curable Center we're not<br>saying he would necessarily go to the<br>cath lab to have a Stanford in the<br>middle of the night but if he needs it<br>he's in the best person the best place<br>for us to make that decision so again<br>that's just emphasizing components of<br>the pathway so we're saying patients<br>should be transferred as a routine<br>logistically this is going to take a<br>little bit of while for us to work<br>through in New Zealand but it's<br>something that we are aspiring to and<br>again the important thing is all of us<br>working together with some John's not as<br>well to trying to align all our systems<br>what about rose so her Archie was open<br>seven and a half hours from first<br>symptoms Alan good bad it's not bad Rob<br>good bad<br>not good enough it's not good enough I<br>think<br>so again if you get back to what we're<br>talking about earlier with that<br>flowchart when she hits the medical<br>system things move through pretty<br>quickly what she did wrong is that she<br>weird it and it's not uncommon for<br>people to wait because they don't know<br>as Rob mentioned that you know it's not<br>not ever most people do not have a<br>classical symptoms of a crushing<br>elephant on their chest so it's very<br>often be very bad trying to work out<br>what's going on but if we look at delays<br>to treatment today delay is attributable<br>to the passion so not quite knowing what<br>what's going on accounts for up to two<br>thirds at the time before we get on and<br>open up with the artery more likely to<br>arise in older people women people with<br>diabetes and patients of lower<br>socioeconomic status and public health<br>campaigns they're really important to<br>try and increase awareness this is our<br>last campaign with the Heart Foundation<br>we run it again last year we will run it<br>again this year and what you see here is<br>that pre campaigns and Jones colloids<br>increase during the campaign and there's<br>a legacy effect for a period of time<br>afterwards the problem is that it<br>doesn't stay you've got to keep doing<br>the campaign's also and Rob alluded to<br>this let's not forget that one in ten<br>people with ischemic heart disease<br>blockages in the arteries their deaths<br>occur outside hospitals so what else did<br>Rose do that we we would advise her not<br>to do and then the Heart Foundation<br>campaign she drove herself didn't she<br>yeah so that's why do we recommend<br>starting one one one so it's to get<br>prompt access to defibrillator yeah so<br>she develops it at a rhythm problem it<br>can be recognized and treated quickly<br>and what we have seen Mississippi in<br>theater commands at Qi I'll bring you<br>over to the end here comparing 2015-2016<br>patients with heart attacks arriving by<br>ambulances they have increased slightly<br>over that time period by about 6%<br>so again it's an important simply small<br>but important finally just to mention<br>good some anybody heard good some those<br>good sounds an app that's available was<br>launched at the resuscitation meeting in<br>Wellington a couple of weeks ago we all<br>can sign up for this I think it's<br>important that we all consider signing<br>up for this if you know CPR we in New<br>Zealand we need to become a community of<br>lifesavers if you have a cardiac if you<br>have a cardiac out of hospital cardiac<br>arrest in New Zealand you've got just<br>over a 10 percent chance of leaving<br>leaving Hospital what what's going to<br>save more people's lives as people<br>knowing CPR and knowing how to use an<br>AED where the AEDs are good sound helps<br>alert you know this isn't the rest<br>outside here and you sign up to good<br>sound good sound will notify you can you<br>come and help it will tell you whether<br>later state where the nearest AED is so<br>I'd encourage you to have a look at this<br>on the either the app the Apple Store or<br>Google Play and if you know CPR please<br>consider signing up for finally just to<br>mention journeys sharing stories we<br>found this really powerful and emotive<br>on the Heart Foundation real people<br>sharing their own stories to help and<br>support others so if you haven't looked<br>at the Heart Foundation website I'd<br>recommend you have a look at the journey<br>section so Norman I'll finish up there<br>and thank you very much for your<br>attention<br>not the evening off are you going to go<br>to the brain of course saying the final<br>lecture this evening is presented by<br>Professor Alan barber Alan's the<br>clinical leader of the Auckland City<br>Hospital strike service and also as the<br>neurological foundation of New Zealand<br>professor of clinical neurology in the<br>power of the medicine University of<br>Auckland so he's one of our preeminent<br>neurologists and stoic specialists he<br>graduated from otago and competed<br>neurology training in Auckland in 1997<br>he then went on to the University of<br>Melbourne and that is PhD there in 2000<br>graduated in 2000 as thesis which is<br>going to touched on tonight of course is<br>the fact that he looked at the role of<br>advanced imaging techniques and<br>identifying patients with the potential<br>to respond to acute stroke therapies and<br>after he returned to New Zealand in 2001<br>established an international leading<br>stroke unit Auckland City Hospital and<br>he was appointed to the neurological<br>Foundation chair here in 2008 and as<br>you'll hear and there's talk tonight is<br>Elza innovative and leading researcher<br>he's focusing on the use of advanced<br>neural physiology and MRI imaging<br>techniques and Stroke and he's got a<br>very engaging topic tonight pulling out<br>clots to treat strokes Ellen<br>right I feel a bit vulnerable being the<br>only neurologist in this crowd at the<br>front<br>so I'll just get my talk up this is a<br>slide show it's great to be here talking<br>with you tonight and I'm gonna talk<br>about stroke but let's figure out what<br>we're talking about a stroke is a sudden<br>onset of a focal brain deficit caused by<br>a problem with the arteries that's why<br>it's called a stroke you get struck down<br>the symptoms come on almost immediately<br>and the arteries either block and about<br>80% of the cases or they burst and about<br>15 to 20 percent of the cases and I'm<br>going to talk about the blocking sort of<br>strokes they're scheming strokes so<br>we've heard a little bit about<br>atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis<br>occurs in the heart arteries but it<br>occurs elsewhere and it occurs in<br>characteristic places and one of the<br>characteristic places is in the carotid<br>artery just in here don't feel them both<br>at the same time and with the artery<br>branches there's turbulent blood flow<br>and you get an a thorough sclerotic<br>clark laid down and it's but this is a<br>characteristic place for the plaque to<br>be laid down and you can see these in<br>life this is an angiogram these are the<br>vertebra there are some fillings and<br>teeth this is the carotid artery this is<br>the internal carotid artery goes<br>straight up into the brain and you can<br>see you don't have to be a rocket<br>scientist to see that's not a good thing<br>okay so that's what we would call a<br>critical stenosis and blood can clot and<br>block that and all sorts of terrible<br>things can happen so they account for<br>about a quarter of strokes and the other<br>another<br>third of strokes are due to embolism<br>from somewhere else and the usual course<br>site of embolism is the heart and the<br>most common cause of emboli is a<br>fibrillating heart and if the hearts<br>fibrillating and not pumping clots form<br>even on the inside of the body and if<br>they get big enough they can break off<br>they can go anywhere in the body but if<br>they go to the brain they can eventually<br>get to an artery that's too small for<br>them to go any further and they block it<br>off and you're in big trouble and this<br>is a little cartoon if you watch down<br>here this that's a clot these are the<br>arteries supplying the brain that's the<br>middle cerebral artery supplies most of<br>one half of the brain the clock comes up<br>it's too big to go any further the brain<br>downstream around that clot dies pretty<br>quickly but all of this brain further<br>out is getting reduced blood because<br>over the top you're getting collateral<br>flow from the other arteries is coming<br>around it to try and keep the brain<br>alive<br>unless you break this clock down very<br>quickly that in fact core that stroke<br>gets bigger and bigger and that happens<br>over a few hours and so like the heart<br>you've got a few hours in which to do<br>some good and then you've seen this<br>tonight already and to be honest if you<br>remember nothing else from my talk<br>tonight remember this remember fast and<br>I know most of you probably heard this<br>but people don't know what strokes are<br>if you have chest pain you're a<br>middle-aged man you know you're having a<br>heart attack I know there are there are<br>difficulties if you wake up in the<br>morning your arms numb you know people<br>often think we're not just slipped on it<br>funny they don't go to the doctor and<br>you know that can be a problem or<br>they're at hand as weak and they're just<br>not sure what's happening now big<br>strokes people get to hospital pretty<br>quickly but these smaller and<br>medium-sized strokes is a big problem<br>for us so if someone has something<br>suddenly because strokes get struck down<br>they had some sort of funny turn think<br>fast and so get the person to smile if<br>one side of their mouth doesn't come up<br>that's a clue<br>now there are other causes of an uneven<br>smile but they come on more slowly okay<br>so if it came on suddenly that's a clue<br>that it may be a stroke get them to lift<br>up their arms if the arms paralyzed<br>that's pretty obvious but if it drifts<br>down like this they might be having a<br>medium or small stroke and then get them<br>to say something because language in<br>most of us sits on the left side of the<br>brain the part of the brain that looks<br>after language and if that's been<br>affected by the stroke the person may<br>not be able to understand what you're<br>saying or they may not be able to<br>express what they want to say or the<br>muscles that make your speech may be<br>weak and they've got slurred speech and<br>the t is for time and that's the reason<br>why and Jerry sort of alluded to this is<br>that you've got a limited amount of time<br>to do something before it's all over<br>before that in fact core has expanded in<br>the strokes as big as it's gonna get<br>okay and look at the watch to see you<br>know what the time is okay so how do we<br>treat stroke well when I was a junior<br>doctor which doesn't feel that long ago<br>but strokes were the last people with<br>strokes were the last people seen on the<br>ward round<br>they were usually clocked in by the<br>medical students and you saw them last<br>on the ward round and they were in the<br>corner and that was because there was<br>nothing that you could do apart from<br>good nursing care and physio<br>occupational and speech language therapy<br>and since I was a junior doctor things<br>have changed okay and as difficult it is<br>to agree with Jerry he's right<br>we're 10 to 20 years behind the<br>cardiologists we have known since 1993<br>that stroke units for every 18 people<br>you treat them a stroke unit compared<br>with a general ward one more survives<br>and is not disabled having said that<br>we've only had stroke units in our<br>hospitals and all of our big hospitals<br>in the last five years it's taken that<br>long to get stroke units in all Hospital<br>a single esperan for someone having an<br>ischemic stroke for every hundred people<br>you treat you prevent one from dying or<br>disability so it's not the best<br>treatment in the world you're gonna<br>treat a hundred people to save one but<br>it's very cheap and very effective we've<br>known that giving alter plays the<br>clot-busting drug we still use alter<br>plays but we're going to start using<br>tenecteplase because the studies are<br>coming but anyway so we're following<br>cardiology again giving alter plays into<br>the vein clot busting drug we've known<br>since 1996 that that's effective but<br>still only about 10 percent of people<br>with stroke actually get it in this<br>country and that's not unusual around<br>the world but what I'll probably talk<br>around about the most is clot retrieval<br>so this is going in and fishing out the<br>clot and this is really exciting after<br>this big desert with nothing happening<br>in stroke medicine between 1996 and 2015<br>we've now got something we can do and<br>it's for the biggest strokes the ones<br>that are the most devastating that's<br>really exciting so this is a case of<br>mine mr. a the initials been changed and<br>that's not his age but you get the idea<br>64 year old was getting ready for work<br>he's got a background of high blood<br>pressure he stopped smoking six or seven<br>years ago he'd been up had a shower and<br>at 20 power 7:00 in the morning he had<br>the sudden onset of right-sided weakness<br>such that he fell over and he had<br>slurred speech he got to hospital just<br>over an hour later and he had no<br>movement or feeling on the right side of<br>his body<br>and he couldn't speak at all so<br>right-sided body the left side of the<br>brain looks after the right-sided of the<br>body so he's got a problem a left the<br>left hemisphere parts of that part of<br>the brain looks after your language and<br>so he's got we call a dysphasia this is<br>a big stroke this is a scan and these<br>these are the temporal lobes so under<br>the temples these are his eyes okay it's<br>pretty cool like this that's his lens<br>that's the nerve that goes from the back<br>of the eye to the brain and these are<br>the muscles that actually<br>move the eyes anyway these are the<br>arteries okay that's the middle cerebral<br>artery on one side and that's the middle<br>cerebral artery on the other side and<br>when you're looking at a scan when I'm<br>gonna head lecturing students look for<br>the difference between the two sides and<br>this artery is nice and juicy and this<br>artery stops there can you see that and<br>that's a clot and so this is as<br>angiogram so we get a little wide sort<br>of probably a little bit thicker than<br>they can't even see that but a little<br>bit thicker than that maybe that feed it<br>up through the femoral artery this is<br>actually the catheter you can see it<br>here can you see that squirt dye and<br>take x-rays as you go I'm sort of like<br>the mum's exactly like the coronary<br>angiography this is new for stroke so<br>we're really excited about it this is<br>the middle cerebral artery and look what<br>happens it stops dead this is a skull<br>can you see that just open if you can<br>see that but there's nothing there's no<br>blood flow there that's a big problem<br>this is a massive stroke these are the<br>biggest strokes you can have and a<br>significant number of people with a<br>stroke like this died maybe 60 70<br>percent and the rest of the people are<br>left disabled these are the biggest<br>strokes you can have this is a perfusion<br>study this is some of the advanced<br>imaging this is where there's reduced<br>blood flow that's almost half as brain<br>and that's going to die in the next few<br>hours probably in the next six hours now<br>we've got the clot busting drug but this<br>is the problem with clot-busting drugs<br>for big strokes this is what we show<br>patients when they come in with a little<br>pictogram of these are the benefits and<br>the risks these are a hundred figures<br>and for every 100 people we treat with<br>the clot busting drug for stroke we help<br>13 really well they go home basically<br>normal and about a third of people we<br>help or they go home normal we actually<br>harms four<br>because you cause bleeding you open up<br>the clot the brains dying it's all mushy<br>that's not a medical term and if you<br>open up and restore blood flow you can<br>get bleeding into the brain and so for<br>every hundred people we treat we cause<br>bleeding in three the cardiologists you<br>cause it for every hundred it's one but<br>it's for us it's three the problem with<br>older players is this two thirds of the<br>people that has absolutely no effect on<br>and the reason why that is is because<br>it's no good at dissolving big clots<br>don't have to worry about these are<br>these are the different arteries but for<br>mr. a I know that when I start that<br>infusion running into his vein there's<br>only a 30% chance it's going to open up<br>the artery there's a 70% chance that<br>it's not gonna open up the artery and<br>that trust me that makes your heart sing<br>so it's effective but it's not<br>particularly effective and it doesn't<br>dissolve big clots so for a long time<br>we've been looking for ways at trying to<br>open up clots and we've tried suckers<br>we've tried corkscrews we've site tried<br>everything and we were involved here in<br>a large Australasian stroke trial we're<br>basically all the all the stroke doctors<br>in Australia in New Zealand took part<br>and it was one of five international<br>studies that all were published at the<br>same time testing what we call a stem<br>Retriever which is a little bit of<br>chicken wire very fancy and expensive<br>and what you do is you feed it up you<br>get your catheter up through the femoral<br>artery squirting dye so you know where<br>you are this is the middle cerebral<br>artery stem this is where mr. a is got<br>his clot and unlike previously we were<br>used to nibble at the clock and suck the<br>clot in corkscrew the clot from the<br>proximal end from the this end with this<br>technique you actually go all the way<br>through the clot and then you open up<br>the chicken wire stent coming back and<br>so that means you're not pushing the<br>clot further upstream and you're not<br>breaking bits of clot off going upstream<br>and then once you've got it like that<br>you pull and suck and you can avert a<br>patient like<br>this to this okay so that's the bet was<br>the artery that was blocked and you've<br>restored the blood flow to most of one<br>half of his brain and you just hope it<br>was soon enough to prevent that in fact<br>call from having expanded too much this<br>is the clot so these are that's<br>fingernails fingernails about a<br>centimeter<br>that's the little chicken wire stent<br>this clots 2 or 3 centimeters long and<br>it's not a surprise that they're<br>clot-busting drugs don't dissolve that<br>it's just a big clot and by the<br>following day he'd gone from being<br>paralyzed down the right side not being<br>able to speak to having mild right-sided<br>weakness he went home after four days<br>and when I saw him for follow-up at 3<br>months he was normal back at work he had<br>a 60 to 70 percent chance of dying and<br>an almost 0% chance of having a good<br>functional outcome and he would have<br>still been a hospital hospital at 3<br>months so that's into vesicular clot<br>retrieval so how are we doing so this is<br>brand-new this is really exciting ok and<br>so far we've treated 310 patients in New<br>Zealand most of these are in Auckland<br>but Christchurch is ramping up they've<br>done 50 and Wellington's done a few and<br>they're ramping up people are about 64<br>years of age our oldest person is 92 we<br>don't have a age cutoff if the 92 year<br>olds are driving and delivering meals on<br>will she gets the treatment slightly<br>more men than woman and these are the<br>number of cases so this is a good<br>example of taking powder and research<br>improves clinical care so we're bouncing<br>these are the numbers of people 2011 to<br>today and we're bouncing along on the<br>bottom and these are the people that<br>we're now trial and there aren't that<br>many of them but it meant that here in<br>Auckland we were hit ahead of the pack<br>in the world because we took part in the<br>trial we know how to do it we're<br>experienced with it and we're now our<br>trial and the other four trials were<br>published at the same time in 2015 the<br>numbers have taken off<br>and this is where we project out that's<br>the end of this year and it'll be double<br>back next year okay so exponential<br>growth so this is right at the bigness<br>is hot off the press and when one of the<br>more active centers in the world so how<br>do we do this is it for the<br>cardiologists we call it a techie school<br>not at Timmy score and we open about 85<br>87 percent of the arteries either<br>completely or near completely and if you<br>don't open the artery the brain's gonna<br>die okay and so the ability to open up<br>eighty odd percent of the arteries as<br>opposed to thirty percent with the clot<br>busting drug it's a no-brainer that was<br>that was not intentional so how good is<br>it it's really good it's really really<br>good and these are the biggest strokes<br>these are the small ones do you know<br>about the concept of number needed to<br>treat the number need of number of<br>people you need to treat to get<br>something okay the number needed to<br>treat to see a significant improvement<br>as two point six so for every<br>two-and-a-half people we treat we see a<br>significant benefit and one and by<br>significant benefit I mean moving<br>someone from private hospital level care<br>to rest home care or from rest home care<br>to going home but needing help or from<br>going home and eating helped to being<br>independent so a shift of one point on<br>that scale so for every two enough<br>people we treat for every five people we<br>treat one goes home normal that wouldn't<br>have and for every six people we treat<br>there is one less person who requires<br>our long term hospital level care so<br>back-of-the-envelope calculation that<br>two hundred three hundred ten patients<br>we have treated so far there are a<br>hundred and thirty-odd who are<br>significantly improved there are sixty<br>two more people who are independent who<br>wouldn't have been and there are fifty<br>two people who have avoided hospital<br>level care and talking to hospital<br>there's no hospital managers here<br>they're only interested in this figure<br>hospital level cares a hundred thousand<br>dollars per year for the rest of that<br>person's life so they like that because<br>if<br>it's 52 more of them you read that up<br>it's a lot of money saved so how do we<br>do this in New Zealand well timing is<br>everything you know time is brain the<br>sooner you'd start treatment and the<br>more likely this is going to work it's<br>technically challenging you need a<br>highly skilled team and at present there<br>are only three places in the country<br>they can do it so this is like<br>cardiology 20 years ago and so we do it<br>at Auckland and we do it in Wellington<br>and we do it in Christchurch and we have<br>piggybacked on the cardiac experience<br>with flying people up and down the<br>country to get their heart arteries<br>opened and so these are helicopter<br>flight times so the trip patients we've<br>treated here at Auckland a significant<br>number of them have come from outside of<br>the Auckland metro area Northland we<br>cover Taranaki we had our first patient<br>from Hawke's Bay in the weekend and<br>similarly in the South Island<br>Christchurch provides a service so as I<br>said when I started when I went off when<br>I was trained to be a neurologist and I<br>said I wanted to do stroke my senior<br>colleagues thought that that was fine<br>but I'd have to do something else proper<br>as well<br>because there was nothing that could be<br>done about stroke and over the years you<br>know we've followed behind the<br>cardiologists with the stroke units<br>they're clot-busting drugs and now with<br>stent retrieval pulling out the clots<br>this is really exciting I mean this is<br>just fantastic we're only just starting<br>we're only doing the big strokes at the<br>moment but I've got no doubt in the next<br>few years we'll be going into smaller<br>and smaller arteries<br>these are drainpipes compared with what<br>the cardiologists are doing and so in<br>the next few years we'll be going into<br>the branches smaller and smaller<br>branches and treating patients with<br>stroke like this so I will stop there<br>and thank you very much for your<br>attention 8:30 exactly and I'd like to<br>do just two things to wind this up first<br>of all thank you as an audience I think<br>it's been a practically a full house and<br>you've been wonderfully attentive very<br>patient and the questions have been<br>terrific indicating your close attention<br>I'd rank you above any sort of average<br>class of medical students for attention<br>well I don't mean that really but on<br>your behalf to thank the sponsors as<br>we're a MRF and Heart Foundation and<br>others but particularly the speakers I<br>think you've heard three superb<br>presentations tonight those are all<br>state-of-the-art believe me and I'm just<br>going to thank them personally I've been<br>contemplating for the last half hour<br>whether I should really sample these the<br>contents of these boxes before handing<br>to them but I'll I think I'll leave<br>there just please as we finish up show<br>your appreciation for these wonderful<br>presentation<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
