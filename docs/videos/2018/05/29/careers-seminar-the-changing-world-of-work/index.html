University of Auckland Business School Alumni team and Careers Advisors explores the changing world of work and how technological, social and environmental changes can be barriers or opportunities to future employment.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>welcome everyone so the topic changing<br>world of work<br>it's very topical at the moment but a<br>lot of people take the perspective of<br>economics and organizational level but<br>we wanted to bring it down to<br>individuals to what it actually means<br>for us as people in our working day life<br>the thing is for Tamzin and i this is a<br>very interesting time to be a careers<br>consultant because we have found that a<br>lot of the things are actually already<br>happening there's a lot of trends coming<br>from overseas that we hear about and<br>it's like a way of a sort of coming down<br>hitting New Zealand when it comes to<br>career stuff so we'll talk more about<br>that up on the screen we've got one of<br>our favorite websites we tell the<br>students if they you know get tired of<br>studying in at midnight they want a<br>little bit of a change from sort of<br>studying for their exam they should pop<br>onto this website it's actually really<br>fun I would like to be a robot counselor<br>that would be my pick you're not<br>actually counseling robots you're<br>counseling people who actually purchase<br>robots to make sure that they get the<br>one that they really need another fun<br>one that I really like is next door it's<br>a real Wilder so the idea particularly<br>overseas is that farms are going to be<br>vertical<br>so all these car parks cap out buildings<br>that we don't need they can turn them<br>into sort of like market gardens so in<br>the middle of the city you'll have a<br>Market Garden but they'll need real<br>Wilders to turn them to turns like all<br>the roads and all the infrastructure<br>we've got back into nature so that's<br>what every Wilder does so if you ever<br>get a chance just have a pop on to this<br>slide the PowerPoint that we've got will<br>actually be sent to you so you don't<br>have to sort of like try and memorize<br>take note of any of these websites we'll<br>so this is what we'll cover tonight so<br>we'll start off by sort of looking at<br>tombs that are quite often talked about<br>like Internet of Things or gig economy<br>and we'll define them we'll sort of like<br>get an understanding of what they mean<br>and then we'll bring it down to that<br>personal level that I was talking about<br>how we find work where we work the types<br>of work environments that we'll have and<br>throughout and at the end we'll give<br>some tips about how to thrive we're<br>trying to take a positive look at this<br>rather than sort of its doom and gloom<br>robots are going to take over our jobs<br>and we'll all be unemployed it is<br>actually really exciting and I genuinely<br>do mean this but we're going to kick off<br>with a bit of a fun quiz so what we'd<br>like to do is to get you to sort of lit<br>yell out some dates that these things<br>were first used first one is email any<br>earlier earlier oh you're always very<br>yes was it mind you 70 there<br>I feel like an auctioneer can we have<br>going up by one<br>once 1971 bingo bingo okay<br>it was a World Wide Web no no this time<br>someone said it 1990 the winner of the<br>okay what's the name okay text message<br>when was the first text message sent no<br>this was later than eyeful effectuate no<br>all night close very close to the 1991<br>1992 92 so it was actually someone<br>called Neil Papworth he was a test<br>engineer he sent it on December 3rd from<br>his computer to the cell phone of<br>someone called Richard javis if you want<br>now this was later than I like 98 okay<br>and now for the last useless fact Whedon<br>was good to Google first used on a<br>television program<br>sorry now what the what television<br>program was it used on that to Google to<br>Google something<br>so there you go go Buffy okay so this<br>some fun dates we've got done as you'll<br>see here quite a lot of interesting<br>dates over the last few centuries that<br>speak to the whole sort of changes in<br>technology from from the printing press<br>in 1440 to the Bitcoin ATM I didn't even<br>know about 20 coin ATM existed in 2013<br>so so great deal of technical<br>innovations heaps as you'll see in the<br>last 50 years and you'll see from this<br>that there's been a mess of increase in<br>productivity and this sort of goes me at<br>the last 150 years mostly 30 fold<br>increase in productivity has resulted<br>mostly from techno technology and other<br>innovations and that that have been<br>going on in our environment change<br>normal it's a natural and desirable<br>state we've always experienced that and<br>as you can see from this we've<br>experienced lots of changes over the<br>last few decades what's different now<br>it's the speed of the change it took 50<br>years for the landline to be mainstream<br>in America it took 10 years for the<br>smartphone to be mainstream and so it's<br>that speed of change that actually can<br>freak a lot of us out I'm going to go<br>through a little bit of a glossary here<br>because we're going to be using these<br>rooms through it throughout this<br>presentation so uh alternatives staffing<br>or non-standard employment which is<br>about hiring people with sort of a nice<br>traditional way part-time on-call fixed<br>to project tasks based freelancing those<br>sorts of things portfolio career this is<br>a sort of a relatively new career tomb<br>last ten years preps and it really looks<br>at people who may have a variety of<br>different roles so they could have a mix<br>of part-time jobs they could have<br>contracts do got a freelancing they<br>could be self-employed but they also<br>could be employed by a more traditional<br>employer as well the gig economy it is<br>the sort of people doing gigs so people<br>having who have those sorts of<br>alternative staffing arrangements and<br>that's that trend has begun there's a<br>prediction that by 2020 forty percent of<br>the u.s. workforce will be independent<br>contractors or freelancers and I'm sure<br>a lot of people in this room are<br>probably encountering that as well under<br>neither things the IOT this is the the<br>high levels of interconnection between<br>our devices and our devices have got<br>stuff embedded in them that can talk to<br>other devices and you'd be surprised and<br>somewhat frightened to him to know they<br>live a live that interconnectivity<br>and also the implications that they<br>attend to content connect it's hard to<br>cyber security is a major one there so<br>navigating this new and I'm sorry I<br>forgot the fourth Industrial Revolution<br>their fusion of technologies and people<br>and sort of negative eighteen towards<br>that the next Industrial Revolution as<br>you can see each of these would have had<br>massive and pets on the workforces of<br>the time so that first one with some<br>back in 1784 where steam and water meant<br>that things could be mechanized<br>1870 the the division of labor changed<br>electricity made a mess of difference<br>and mass production really started to<br>ramp up as recently as 1969 that third<br>Industrial Revolution with the use<br>increasing use of electronics IT and<br>much more automated production some<br>people think that IT was invented in the<br>80s of course but and that was earlier<br>than that and then that's fourth<br>Industrial Revolution some people say<br>that that's already here but others say<br>we're not quite there yet so that's why<br>that's got a question mark but they do<br>talk about the fourth Industrial<br>Revolution being their fusion of<br>Technology and people and I guess that<br>can be slightly frightening in that our<br>doctors and ibm's watson going to be the<br>people who actually diagnose you rather<br>than you just relying on doctors are you<br>going to have nanotech stuff injected<br>into you to actually help solve problems<br>so tiny little robots going around in<br>your bloodstream it but healing you so<br>it's got to be a good thing the printing<br>of of limbs that might be done in<br>someone's garage<br>rather than having having to go and go<br>through a great rigmarole so so as you<br>can see this is these the implications<br>for the way that we work in the way that<br>we live of this fourth Industrial<br>Revolution are also really significant<br>and this is actually going to impact a<br>great deal on business models you'll see<br>from from this slide that there's<br>already something that's impacting<br>business models some of which we're<br>going to talk about tonight some of<br>which we're not going to because it<br>would be a day seminar rather than an<br>hour seminar if we did but you see the<br>2015 to 2017 some stuff coming through<br>the that's that's having a significant<br>impact of already engineered of things<br>the longevity and eight aging societies<br>advancement<br>during and 3d printing and and these are<br>going to actually really significantly<br>impact on things in the future robotics<br>autonomous transport support artificial<br>intelligence now of course these are<br>being used now but that there's a sense<br>that they might not making a massive<br>impact on us at the moment but they have<br>the potential to make an incredible<br>impact on us in the future I was really<br>interested when I looked at the Internet<br>of Things and I started thinking about<br>it on my smartphone I can turn my lights<br>on at home I can control my vacuum<br>cleaner I hate that coming so I've got a<br>robot vacuum cleaner and I control my<br>stereo as well so there's just so many<br>things that we can already do so the<br>Internet of Things for me because I'm a<br>techie geek is really exciting I can't<br>wait for the next thing that I'll get I<br>was really excited when I got my first<br>robot and so technically technical<br>experts are predicting all sorts of<br>really really significant things that<br>are going to affect sometimes that there<br>will be really significant tipping<br>points and things like clothes connected<br>to the Internet<br>why might you have that well you might<br>have that because you look by yourself<br>and you may have medical condition that<br>you need to be monitored and those<br>clothes could actually be monitoring<br>your medical condition<br>things like driverless cars things AI<br>machines being on boards of directors I<br>find that a little bit free keep<br>thinking of them and artificial<br>intelligence choosing and the way that<br>their business is going to go but these<br>all have the potential to really<br>significantly affect jobs and the fit<br>the way that you're going to work in the<br>future jobs and skills they exchanging<br>significantly and there's lots of doom<br>and gloom out there about the way that<br>the change changes that are happening<br>now can could actually be bad for us<br>this is actually a more optimistic<br>viewpoint that one of the dominant<br>truths of the 21st century is that<br>almost anything that you can imagine<br>being done by a machine will be done<br>mired by machine but it's great because<br>what that leaves us as the creator of<br>space the significant made labor market<br>disruption but we talked about there<br>being disruption it's being jobs<br>displaced but also jobs created and<br>you'll see that careers in 2030 that<br>link will be on the some PowerPoint<br>presentation that you get so you can<br>never play round of that and so there<br>will be an awful lot of jobs that have<br>been created in the last 10 years the<br>last 20 years we see students who come<br>and they they ask us about a particular<br>role and what we thought it was that<br>we'd only just heard about it and<br>sometimes we actually have to do<br>something for an etic research because<br>they don't and they may even be ahead of<br>us so I say yes so the labor markets are<br>being disrupted but there's a but<br>there's also an awful lot of them jobs<br>and job families that are on the<br>increase along with those jobs that are<br>going into the into the decline so I'm<br>so looking at those those job families<br>you'll see that things that use the<br>intellectual skills those creative<br>skills architecture engineering the<br>computer and mathematical jobs<br>management jobs business and finance<br>jobs those sorts of jobs are are on the<br>app whereas some of those jobs that<br>which have a lot more I guess repetitive<br>nature to them so things things like<br>offers an administrative are being what<br>the ones that are more likely to be on<br>the decline at the moment Manufacturing<br>is another construction or all possible<br>areas or real areas of decline the quote<br>that started the section sort of talked<br>about creativity and it's this was these<br>were done by interviews with employers<br>around the world<br>this comes out of the future of jobs<br>report from the World Economic Forum and<br>they see significant changes from 2015<br>to 2020 in what they are the skills that<br>they are going to be looking for and<br>their employees and so they moved to to<br>utilizing skills like creativity like<br>critical thinking it's going to be<br>significant and you'll see that all of<br>those skills in 2020 are non technical<br>you'll also see that they can be aspects<br>of them done and like something like<br>complex problem-solving a computer can<br>help with that<br>certainly but it can it can it often<br>can't do the complete problem solving by<br>itself<br>critical thinking again you can get a<br>computer and an artificial intelligence<br>to have some thoughts of its own using<br>algorithms but it can't actually do it<br>for itself it we need people to learn to<br>do these creativity I'm going to talk a<br>little bit more about that people<br>management I have my suspicions that<br>there's a fair number of people who<br>wouldn't be that entranced by the<br>thought of having a manager who was a<br>robot and so I think that there's always<br>going to be but can you imagine that hit<br>them even one that looks like a person I<br>still think that I think there would be<br>resistance anyway so say it so the so<br>certainly technology will be able to<br>enhance some of these but will it be<br>able to do it by itself is probably not<br>one role that a lot of people talk about<br>accountant we're in the business school<br>so let's talk about accountants there's<br>a website that our out there that says<br>that accountants you know 95 percent<br>likelihood that that won't exist as a<br>career in about 10 years<br>mm-hmm but the thing is that those jobs<br>will still exist they will just change<br>so it's the skills that we've been<br>talking about so the computer will spit<br>out all the numbers they'll be able to<br>do a hundred percent order rather than a<br>sampling but then they need the person<br>to translate what they<br>those numbers mean for the client so<br>that means that first and say of the<br>accounting profession those complex<br>problem-solving critical thinking<br>creativity will become even more<br>important it's those people skills that<br>they will need and if you think of them<br>as interpreters they interpret the<br>numbers for the client so there's a lot<br>of jobs that won't disappear they will<br>just change if it was actually really<br>interesting because we had someone from<br>a seriously high level and a second tier<br>accounting firm wasn't it couple years<br>ago and he said he'd been talking to his<br>people within the accountancy firm<br>already about the changes and someone<br>came to him one day and said I've heard<br>on the radio this morning that they're<br>only gonna be three accountants in New<br>Zealand in five years and he said don't<br>worry that's not going to happen but he<br>said this but what have I been telling<br>you we're going to have to change the<br>way that we do things and so<br>organizations are changing the way that<br>the nature of the work that they are<br>getting people to do I think Toyota is a<br>good example so we think of him as a car<br>manufacturing firm whereas they actually<br>starting to see themselves as a sales<br>and marketing firm it's quite<br>interesting yeah Louis Road Creamery<br>its marketing firm not a manufacturing<br>firm so it's again that that suit goes<br>back to those different business models<br>too doesn't it so the whole creativity<br>and humanity<br>is the thing that we really bring to to<br>our roles to our jobs Automation is<br>going to change the nature of our jobs<br>but often what automation is going to<br>change as the UM is the repetitive the<br>the manual there I say the boring parts<br>of our roles that the tasks that that<br>can be duplicated that can be done<br>through through algorithms and that sort<br>of thing but automation and intelligence<br>is going to help us to focus our<br>attention on what matters most and<br>that's creating new forms of value<br>it's allowing our creativity to flourish<br>and you're going to talk a little bit<br>more about ways to do that and then the<br>next section or in a couple of sections<br>from now and so we're going to actually<br>have to really sort of focus on the<br>humanity that we bring to the workplace<br>and we're going to have to think about<br>how can we actually use those creative<br>skills how can we develop those creative<br>skills if we don't think that we have<br>those those skills how are we going to<br>be interacting with them with people so<br>how we get them reuse our empathy our<br>imagination our vulnerability to<br>actually enhance what we do in the<br>workplace and so it's it's going to be<br>really really um different time but<br>actually one of the great things is that<br>computers will be able to vet<br>information overload that we're going to<br>wit that we're already getting probably<br>from all our devices and things the<br>computers and technology will be able to<br>deal with this and allow us to do what<br>we're best at doing being human beings<br>really so I'm now going to hand over to<br>Peter who's going to be talking about a<br>variety of other changes so in terms of<br>job searching so how we're going to find<br>jobs in the future it's actually already<br>happening some of the changes that we've<br>noticed so just looking at this I don't<br>know how well you can see it but in the<br>pre 1990s it was newspapers we looked<br>for jobs and newspapers but we also used<br>networks as well and then a 1995 career<br>builder was launched and today employers<br>actually search for candidates and they<br>can look at your social media we can use<br>social media ourselves to find jobs and<br>employers can look at social media to<br>find us so what we're busy looking for<br>work you can actually have a situation<br>where recruiters are sort of like<br>investigating us as well it's almost Big<br>Brother is what<br>almost linkedin has developed an<br>economic you know I won't read that one<br>okay there's enough event but what are<br>the important things to is that things<br>like networking it might have might be<br>the sort of the there's the<br>old-fashioned networking that there is<br>the enhanced capability that technology<br>gives you the network isn't there so the<br>thing about networking and the Internet<br>is it's actually transformed the way<br>that how we search how we apply for jobs<br>how we network so before it was face to<br>face but now it's online we can network<br>and using Facebook but typically we use<br>LinkedIn these days so that saying about<br>it's not what you know it's who you know<br>that's more important now than ever<br>before it was really important so in<br>recent years employers have been using<br>LinkedIn social media to find candidates<br>this particular example it's just one<br>column that I thought was interesting<br>was called source they're doing this<br>manually they're browsing the internet<br>to find people and they also found some<br>people from a job back and from a job<br>posting board but the scary thing is<br>even though I did say we were trying to<br>be positive<br>is there something called web scraping<br>so that's an automatic process where<br>they can tell these BOTS to go onto the<br>internet and look for certain things so<br>say they wanted to look for a software<br>developer so they could tell the spot to<br>dis basically look through so much data<br>on the internet go on to a software<br>developer forum with all they they hang<br>out and chat to each other this little<br>bot goes on to the forum collects the<br>name of the software developer the area<br>of specialty where they work the email<br>address the telephone I actually hadn't<br>thought about it but when I was<br>researching this universities we've got<br>our staff profiles our faculty pages are<br>public so if someone wanted to find<br>someone from a university say an<br>academic all they have to do is just get<br>a bot to go out trawl through all the<br>university<br>pages and find names phone numbers areas<br>of specialty email addresses I started<br>to get a little bit freaked out by all<br>that I am the introvert in the room now<br>and the other thing is phone numbers so<br>you know how the social media wants you<br>to put your phone number<br>so that the end of something happens<br>they can contact you on your phone now<br>they really want to do that because then<br>people can search for you using phone<br>number so I'm sort of slightly going off<br>on a track here<br>but I actually use social media in two<br>different ways so I have two names so I<br>use my work name for things like<br>LinkedIn but I use another name for my<br>private social media but if I use my<br>phone number two on both they'll be able<br>to figure out who I am so it's a little<br>bit scary so I'm not going to be putting<br>my phone number anywhere in the future<br>so anyway so web scraping it is legal in<br>case you're wondering at the moment they<br>are looking at the legality of it<br>because there is so much information<br>they can find out all automated so it<br>doesn't require any effort and then what<br>happens is applicant tracking system so<br>you will have encountered these already<br>if you decide you'd like to work for a<br>particular organization you might sign<br>up on their profile put in your<br>information and then if a job comes up<br>they'll have a look at the system see if<br>anyone matches what they're looking for<br>but it can also be when you apply online<br>you'll submit your CV the ATS will take<br>all the details pop it in to the<br>computer system it will look for<br>keywords the computer will decide<br>whether you are a match for the role or<br>not the computer could be the one that<br>rejects you based on your score or the<br>computer could be the one that sends you<br>an invitation to do psychometric test or<br>a video interview so it can take a while<br>down the process before a person is<br>actually involved and we know this<br>happens<br>because some of our students say that<br>when they put their application and<br>online during say March Madness when<br>there's a lot of recruitment going on<br>sometimes within three to five minutes<br>they get many rejection and sometimes<br>they put in their application and I had<br>one who put the application and at 3:30<br>in the morning I said what she said yet<br>I was rejected by 3:40 so I doubted that<br>anyone from the big four was actually<br>sitting up waiting for the hairy<br>application to come and so it must have<br>been a bot that that projected here yeah<br>so this does all happens automatically<br>they can also so you don't put your<br>social media into your CV or into the<br>profile the ATS can actually go and<br>search social media and it can link any<br>of your social media like put your URL<br>into your profile and it can even take<br>more information from say your LinkedIn<br>and pop it into the system and we don't<br>realize all of this is happening but<br>unless your privacy at least we're<br>worried about privacy it can not<br>necessarily yeah privacy Matt okay let's<br>face it it doesn't necessarily mean it's<br>a bad thing but for you it doesn't mean<br>that you need to be very careful about<br>your social media and your social media<br>brand and make sure that that's spot-on<br>it means that when you put in an<br>application you need to match keywords<br>so the ATS will be searching for certain<br>keywords like people skills so you need<br>to check the job air the job description<br>their website and see what you words<br>they use and make sure those words are<br>in your application and people skills<br>and interpersonal skills are the same<br>thing but if you use people skills and<br>they've used interpersonal and even sort<br>of like abbreviations and things so<br>search engine optimization use the words<br>that they use both in say your<br>application and on your social media as<br>well and then the other thing is when it<br>comes to sort of like doing a CV you<br>don't want to use tables borders boxers<br>headers footers<br>because sometimes the ATS can just not<br>read what's in them and it can just come<br>up as blank um if you do sort of like<br>you think they're the type of<br>application you're putting in chances<br>are it'll be looked at by an 80s and<br>then just google it because Howard a<br>doer friendly 80s friendly CV is all<br>over the internet lots of tips it's<br>happening a lot overseas it is happening<br>in New Zealand but it tends to be the<br>larger organisations but as this becomes<br>more cost effective<br>it saves organizations time<br>administration and what it does is that<br>frees up the people and the organization<br>to do the people stuff that Tamsin was<br>talking about the connections are making<br>contact with people we attended a<br>one-day seminar last week and one<br>recruiter was talking about how his team<br>are always online they use LinkedIn<br>excessively extensively and excessively<br>and they want to be connected they want<br>you to connect with them and connect<br>with other people in the firm<br>it's those personal connections that are<br>really important they're not keen on<br>scattergun applications where they can<br>see someone is just applying to every<br>job that seems to be going on their firm<br>they want them to be targeted and really<br>matched and they want you to reach out<br>and talk to them<br>he said they reward initiative in that<br>way too so if you contact them in a<br>slightly different way than they are<br>they may reward that initiative by<br>contacting you back yeah<br>the other thing we're noticing because<br>of this partly is the focus on online<br>application boom forms so some firms<br>aren't doing a cover letter anymore they<br>just want you to submit an application<br>form in a CV there's one organization<br>during the graduate recruitment round<br>which here at the university a lot of<br>firms recruit and March one organization<br>had just an application form no CV or<br>anything<br>one recruiter from one of the bank's she<br>was saying that she thought CV would<br>pretty much die in the next few years<br>and it would be replaced by something<br>like linkedin so they might just want<br>application form your LinkedIn URL no CV<br>no cover letter so we understand to see<br>how that pans out you know most online<br>applications sometimes they'll ask quite<br>weird or unusual questions that you<br>think that they are but they actually do<br>matter they may use that as a screening<br>tool so you may not even get to the next<br>stage because of those application<br>questions so you need to treat them with<br>it just as much importance as if they if<br>they even if they ask for a CV in a<br>cover letter because they may not look<br>at your CV in your cover letter if you<br>have an answered those questions in a<br>way that engages and interests them so<br>these are things we're seeing sort of a<br>coming through but they seem to be<br>gaining momentum<br>another thing that they've been talking<br>a lot about overseas as blind<br>applications and this has come through<br>to new zealand now as well and they take<br>up way sort of identifiable information<br>so your name anything that identifies<br>your gender your ethnicity they even can<br>remove the school that you into so this<br>is to remove what's called unconscious<br>bias which and our sort of like<br>fielder's so like a big buzzword at the<br>moment unconscious bias the other thing<br>we're noticing psychometric tests and<br>pretty much has stayed the same for a<br>very long time sort of you know I don't<br>know 10 15 years ago they went from<br>paper to online but that was about the<br>only difference they seemed to be pretty<br>much the same but they are changing just<br>lately in gamification as a particular<br>change that is using technology to its<br>utmost I think we've got time heavy so<br>gamification it's like playing an online<br>computer game so people like me would<br>I just want to pause just that bit for a<br>minute so one of the things that's<br>different is you know how when you do<br>some people do a jigsaw puzzle they'll<br>look at the piece they'll look at sort<br>of the puzzle and they'll look and then<br>they'll just put it straight in the<br>right spot and then other people will<br>take a piece and they'll just move it<br>all around so with this system they can<br>actually track all your movements around<br>the screen I think that's really cool<br>so for some people that would be really<br>scary and the other people looks like a<br>lot of fun you don't have to be a pro<br>gamer it's sort of like candy crush type<br>level Angry Birds<br>so that looks like fun and it was<br>introduced into New Zealand couple of<br>years ago two three years ago and like<br>one or two films and the terms of the<br>great graduate recruitment space were<br>using it and more and more are starting<br>to do it so that is definitely a growing<br>trend another one is video interviews<br>that was introduced about four or five<br>years and the graduate recruitment space<br>by one of the big four and now pretty<br>much everyone is doing it that one was<br>like a snowball just down how it was<br>yeah really quick uptake of that so<br>video interviewers where US sent a link<br>you were asked to record answers to say<br>five questions you do it on with your<br>computer there is no interviewer there<br>or behind you know sort of a camera so<br>it's very sort of like it feels a bit<br>weird and you're trying to sort of like<br>answer these questions yes some people<br>are nodding it's it's a bit<br>disconcerting after speaking to the<br>camera and then you send it off and you<br>don't know who's going to look at it how<br>many people are going to look at it it's<br>a little bit freaky I mean video CV it<br>might be that some people do one a video<br>CV to sort of basically show their<br>personality so they might take a<br>recruiter through their CV and it's just<br>a compliment to their paper CV but in<br>some cases employers might ask you to do<br>a video CV so it's a bit different from<br>a video interview and that they might<br>ask you to just talk for a couple of<br>minutes about this topic or take us<br>through your CV and a video so they are<br>using technology more and more and<br>they're coming up with ever creative<br>ways to test people there's another<br>thing we've noticed and that sort of<br>relates to this it's about job seekers<br>so the talks that we went to last week<br>the speaker was talking about something<br>that we've noticed as well and Metz from<br>a job seeker perspective job seekers are<br>starting to look for different things so<br>he joined his organization in 2011 and<br>he said until 2014 hires were really<br>interested in stability Vincennes 2015<br>have been actually focusing on other<br>things they've been asking about things<br>such as career progression the physical<br>work environment which I'll talk about<br>later flexible working so whether they<br>can work from home whether they can work<br>part-time whether they can do project<br>work which is what teams and is going to<br>talk about now<br>so our tentative forms of employment as<br>I mentioned earlier the there's going to<br>be a great deal more of a contingent<br>workforce there's going to be a lot more<br>people who are going to have much more<br>unusual arrangements with them with the<br>particular organisations so one thing<br>that some and Peter and I discussing<br>this we've actually realized is that<br>this may all really be more prevalent so<br>what we'd like you to do is to actually<br>think about your family and friends<br>think about how many of them have got<br>traditional employment isn't like an ax<br>permanent full-time employee or how many<br>of them have got more alternative<br>employment so I'd just like you to just<br>turn to the person next to you and hear<br>okay so this was your traditional<br>what he was doing this so new and<br>everything was like nobody's doing it so<br>now chose the right an employee or is<br>here project worker or okay so more of<br>any did anyone else discuss some where<br>that they had more people they knew who<br>yeah I think certainly the nature of the<br>job can't can influence that I guess one<br>of the things that are the interesting<br>things is that some organizations are<br>now deliberately sort of having their<br>their more standard employees there but<br>also they're choosing to change that<br>around their workforce a lot more<br>through having more people with that<br>mmm-hmm which actually brings me nicely<br>onto the the benefits what have am not I<br>sort of brought about me Oh actually fit<br>what about me most of my family are not<br>on our alternative I'm one of the boring<br>ones who actually have a nine-to-five<br>five-day-a-week job<br>I've got authors and the family<br>self-employed self-employed and working<br>as a portfolio career they're quite<br>quite a quite a wide variety but yes I'm<br>really the the only one who's actually<br>got a standard job and my wider<br>immediate family ya know I'm sort of<br>similar terms of my friends I've got two<br>friends I think who have traditional<br>employment the rest are all alternative<br>I guess it could be considered both<br>depending on the combination I guess<br>with them people often used to be<br>self-employed or not<br>preps mortar non-traditional as the<br>portfolio worker who might be<br>self-employed two days a week employed<br>in a corporation two days a week and and<br>doing something like contracting or<br>something like that a day a week so I<br>guess preps that preps the that<br>portfolio type career is preps a little<br>bit more alternative so a lot of my<br>friends are part-time and also self<br>employed they do both most of them would<br>be that max and then the others would be<br>part-time for various reasons family<br>responsibilities or because they're<br>trying to develop a their own career<br>self-employed but they have to sort of<br>eight work part-time while you're<br>working on it and some people that<br>part-time choice maybe because they want<br>a steady income and one of their roles<br>and and whereas sometimes a<br>self-employed or contracting may not be<br>quite so reliable as far as income goes<br>so moving right along that thinking<br>about the the benefits benefits or<br>employers definitely can be more<br>flexibility they can adapt or order the<br>changes and market conditions and the<br>labor requirements when things sort of<br>go up and down there's the potential for<br>lower labor costs but this that's just<br>the potential and they've also sort of<br>labeled regulations and things like that<br>redundancy packages those sorts of<br>things can be avoided in some of those<br>forms of employment for employees think<br>you can you can actually have a lot more<br>flexibility you can choose who to work<br>for and when to work so you have a much<br>higher a higher flexibility there's a<br>potential for higher income for<br>employees because as a contractor you<br>often get paid a higher hourly rate<br>sometimes as a part-time person you paid<br>a highly higher hourly rate I know that<br>I've said to someone when they wanted me<br>to come in from for one day a week I<br>said well no actually I can't<br>I can't afford to go below this<br>participation amount because that's<br>that's the second amount I don't go<br>below and they said oh oh okay but they<br>paid that because they because they they<br>needed / wanted me so I'm so yeah so<br>that this there's the potential for that<br>it's also some risks though for<br>employers that if they've got a high<br>level of people who have the sort of<br>less standard employment if the labour<br>market gets really tight finding<br>qualified staff can become really<br>difficult and we see there in New<br>Zealand now with some employers really<br>struggling to get skilled people and so<br>they may have to pay more for them<br>there's also the potential for turnover<br>to be a lot higher because of that that<br>lack of certainty of employment that<br>there's also lists of an emotional<br>contract for a lot of people with the<br>employer if they're not in an employer<br>employee relationship for employees<br>where one of the downsides is that the<br>the lack of job security and one of the<br>problems of course is that when when the<br>labor market gets really tight you may<br>struggle to get a job so you may you may<br>struggle to have an income at all and<br>you can also miss out on them benefits<br>things like superannuation your<br>KiwiSaver those sorts of things can be<br>impacted upon so it can have some<br>significant effects if it fits<br>downstream as well and the sort of<br>career implications of this well they're<br>people different people have different<br>career anchors so if security and<br>stability for example was a really<br>important career anchor for you then you<br>may struggle quite a lot being in an<br>environment where where you're a<br>freelancer and you don't have that<br>security and that stability and so so so<br>that's that sort of something that could<br>affect the way that you choose to be<br>employed as well whereas other other<br>things like say pure challenge are<br>important to you then you might get a<br>lot of a buzz a lot of a journal and<br>about being on different pro<br>it's that um that excites you you and<br>you might find the sort of the the whole<br>going to work for the same employer all<br>the time a little bit more boring so<br>thinking about your career in anchors<br>may impact on on the sorts of employment<br>that you might choose one thing I would<br>like to say about the risks though too<br>is that the risk is greater for people<br>who are low-skilled because they're less<br>likely say in an economic downturn to be<br>able to find the number of jobs they<br>need to make a full-time income or if<br>they live in rural areas as well this<br>sort of a bit of a rural city divide<br>satellite Wellington and Auckland and<br>the rest of New Zealand and all of that<br>can impact on some of the risks to this<br>for employees so basically in the 1960s<br>some bright person invented open plan<br>offices so as an introvert you can<br>imagine that has gone down really well<br>with me and with the rest of us<br>I mean someone else in 1968 designed the<br>cubicle office and then if we just kind<br>of like fast-forward to round about now<br>so 2015 big organizations like airpo BBC<br>Google with most of us will have seen<br>pictures of what the Google offices look<br>like they decided that collaborative<br>office design was really important that<br>with social people that rather than<br>having a desk and having formal meetings<br>designing offices so that is a<br>collaborative space you're walking on<br>the corridor you bump into someone you<br>have an informal chat can be perhaps<br>even more effective than all this formal<br>stuff so that happened and has happened<br>around about now um and the thing that<br>has actually made this happen is<br>communication it's had a big impact so<br>particularly laptops and cell phones it<br>means you can work anywhere which may or<br>may not be a good thing if you sort of<br>like one of your career anchors is<br>work-life balance maybe not so good<br>because you could be on the beach and<br>your cell phone rings<br>but it's communication that has allowed<br>this to happen and some companies are<br>now starting to take advantage of it of<br>that so an example in Auckland is Smouse<br>farm so the new vodafone building or<br>they retrofitted it so everything in the<br>building is enabled by smartphone<br>wireless enabled voice and video aware<br>and also incorporates virtual reality<br>yeah you can see I'm smiling so you can<br>work anywhere in the building you can<br>work in a cafe so we did actually have a<br>presentation where someone from Vodafone<br>spoke but he was in a cafe came up and<br>he was talking to our students and the<br>seminar room at the cafe using<br>technology what's cool<br>so that's communication it sort of laid<br>all of us to happen but 1987 cubicle a<br>lot of us sort of like that 1987 side<br>there's a lot of offices that still look<br>like that unfortunately not so many that<br>but they're happening so particularly<br>newer buildings so like the ones that<br>are popping up and when you quarter for<br>example the larger organizations that<br>are shifting down there they're not just<br>doing open plan they're incorporating<br>other aspects of the design you can do<br>really simple things so I was talking<br>about hallway meetings you widen the<br>hallways so it's possible for people to<br>have a hallway meeting you have<br>whiteboards and public places for me<br>that just totally freaks me out and I<br>always thought open plan no way and then<br>I started sort of like seeing the newer<br>designs and how they incorporate<br>different spaces so you might set it a<br>desk like that open-plan hot-desking you<br>can move around the whole building in<br>some cases they don't insist that you<br>sit at your desk for these sorts of<br>organizations you know sort of it's not<br>that you have to be at your desk some<br>organizations think<br>to be working you've got to be sitting<br>there nine-to-five mitre whatever and if<br>you're not at your desk you're not<br>working and there are some companies<br>still like that but more and more<br>they're switching this way you've got<br>your cell phone you can work anywhere in<br>the building or the cafe and it means<br>you've got a choice of spaces of your<br>hot-desking<br>so I used to hot desk and it meant that<br>I had to sit at the desk of someone who<br>wasn't actually there it was their desk<br>I would just camp out that's not real<br>hot desking this is we you could sit in<br>that little sort of like curved area one<br>day you could go down to the cafe in the<br>other day but you need different spaces<br>so it's not all about sort of like the<br>open plan and the whole office thing you<br>need places for privacy for people to<br>focus on their work where they can<br>contemplate restore relax that one<br>mirror where it's all white board that<br>really excites me Thames and lots didn't<br>get it but I just love that idea that's<br>where you would find me if not I would<br>be there so this is all really cool and<br>it's that communication the technology<br>that's allowing it to heaven and we do a<br>workshop with our students and we get<br>them to split themselves and to<br>introvert and extrovert and<br>interestingly they all want all of this<br>they want that they want a office<br>building sort of like with a slide one<br>of them's eared so you could go down the<br>slide to get to the next floor they want<br>coffee<br>but the introverts and the extroverts<br>want the open-plan as well and they want<br>the private spaces so they all want the<br>same things it's just the balance the<br>difference that's all what we thought<br>was really interesting to you and it's<br>interesting that more more organizations<br>are recognizing that people are<br>different and I think that that's that's<br>that's a sort of an important thing but<br>also important when you're going out<br>into the workforce<br>to work out what's the sort of thing<br>that you are interested in what where<br>how and where you want to work because<br>if the the workplace freaks<br>well even if you're loving the work that<br>you're doing you may actually find that<br>the environment is actually poisoning<br>your brain so it's really important to<br>sort of consider this when you're making<br>choices and I guess one question is okay<br>so people can work at home why put in<br>all this effort and money into these<br>office spaces but we're actually social<br>animals we actually do like to be around<br>other people there's actually chemical<br>reactions that happen when you around<br>other people so that's why people work<br>in cafes even when they're just sitting<br>there on their own<br>it actually makes them feel better so<br>that's why organizations are putting the<br>effort into this people do actually want<br>to go to work it's just that balance so<br>this is our final slide so it's<br>strategies to thrive and we've been<br>talking about it as we've been going on<br>so networking social media thinking<br>about what your personal branding are<br>all really important but so was personal<br>resilience so you need to know your<br>personality what you can cope with what<br>sort of degree of stress you can cope<br>with do you need stability in your<br>workplace are you okay with sort of like<br>freedom the other thing is financial<br>resilience there could be periods where<br>you actually have to upskill retrain so<br>you might not be working or you might<br>have been made redundant you're in<br>between projects so you need that<br>financial resilience to be able to cope<br>during those periods personal resilience<br>as well and then of course on top of all<br>of this you're saving for retirement and<br>some people you know some people say Oh<br>superannuation work yeah we won't go<br>down there so personal awareness knowing<br>what you're worth knowing what your<br>values are what's important to you in a<br>workplace what sort of work style and<br>environment you will thrive in so just<br>knowing that about yourself and then<br>connecting with knowing what your worth<br>is that negotiating negotiating skills<br>you need to actually be able to ask an<br>employer for more money and that's<br>something New Zealand is in particular a<br>very bad edge<br>but you need to know sort of what you're<br>worth and be prepared to go and ask and<br>negotiate on your own behalf and also<br>involved in that too as as thinking<br>about what is important to you what what<br>are your values because then you you it<br>may be that you're actually able to<br>sacrifice some money for other aspects<br>of of what you want in your working<br>arrangement so that self-awareness is<br>incredibly important as well that's<br>partly why portfolio career has been on<br>the rise so some people have<br>deliberately downsized job wise career<br>wise or they've picked up portfolio<br>careers because they want to be able to<br>explore other ways of working they want<br>to have more time with their families<br>portfolio careers are becoming more more<br>popular than they used to be when it<br>comes to skills so like when we're<br>talking to our students they sort of<br>worrying about if I study this what job<br>were likea and we can can give them<br>direction about that but a lot of the<br>time we tell them to look at what skills<br>you're gaining from that degree that<br>some employers are hiring because you've<br>got a degree which means you've got a<br>brain and you've got motivation and they<br>will actually teach you what you need to<br>know and they're more interested in<br>transferable skills like critical<br>thinking communication people skills<br>because they can't teach you that and<br>also enthusiasm to work for them to work<br>in that particular job and industry they<br>can't inject you with enthusiasm so the<br>other things that are really important<br>embracing technology and just lifelong<br>learning so one big thing about this as<br>we will just always be learning it's not<br>going to stop that's it's ironic because<br>a lot of our students when they finish<br>their room they bachelor's degree come<br>to say yes that's me done but you know<br>for life no more qualifications no more<br>study and then a couple years later I so<br>so that whole lifelong learning and also<br>organizations are recognizing that the<br>most successful organizations are ones<br>that actually have a strong level of<br>professional and personal development as<br>part of their interaction with their<br>their employees<br>it's another thing that's that's<br>interesting about the whole what way<br>that that sort of work is going is that<br>that they if you are actually a<br>freelancer or something like that you're<br>going to have to embrace that lifelong<br>learning for yourself so your your<br>employee ear may not be doing the<br>professional development you may be<br>they're having to think for yourself<br>what how do I get to the next stage<br>what's important for me to do these<br>particular roles to gain those skills so<br>hopefully that was a optimistic look if<br>the future of work and gave you some<br>tips we do have some food or information<br>here as I see we will send you out the<br>PowerPoint but this has got links to<br>other information that we found<br>interesting so we hope you do too and a<br>lot of the select that images that we've<br>used you'll be able to link to sort of<br>like some of the Articles that we got<br>so the Nick whipped workforce and<br>essentially and also save interest<br>restructure and things like that and<br>interestingly one of the reasons we<br>didn't put so much focus on that was<br>because the research that I've done<br>recently on that is that organizations<br>are thinking about it a lot but not<br>moving so much I think there's a social<br>aspect of it as part of it and certainly<br>that there are organizations are using<br>the networked capability in a variety of<br>different ways in international project<br>teams that sort of stuff but but I think<br>that it's it hasn't changed as fast as<br>we might have thought and there's not<br>there doesn't seem to be a massive<br>amount of buying for larger<br>organizations at the moment I think<br>there's a trust aspect as well and I<br>think that that perhaps as that sort of<br>that knowledge environment becomes more<br>prevalent and people are sort of trusted<br>more then that might change but even so<br>there's again it's that whole social<br>aspect governors and that social aspect<br>and I think it will depend very much on<br>industries so you can see that happening<br>more say in the IT industry than in some<br>others and what might happen is yep the<br>head office will get smaller and they<br>might have satellite offices so they can<br>still have the social aspect where<br>people will still come together but when<br>someone is in a totally different<br>country then yep they'll networking so<br>yeah but if it selects someone at home<br>there is still an expense I say you've<br>got someone in their home office there<br>are still expenses associated with their<br>who's going to pay for the computer is<br>it all going to be economically designed<br>health and safety who's going to pay for<br>the power etc etc so there are still<br>some costs and from the social aspect we<br>are social animals and so we can become<br>quite disassociated from the<br>organisation we don't feel the same sort<br>of loyalty if we're not actually there<br>meeting the people if you think about it<br>you go to work and it's the people that<br>you interact with that you enjoy and<br>it's often the people that keep you<br>there that's also sometimes the people<br>who send you away but it's you know oh I<br>don't want to leave I really love my<br>team whereas if you're sitting on your<br>own in an office networking then so<br>going on Skype or whatever it is but you<br>won't have that connection so I think<br>compliers will find there's more cost<br>associated because turnover or behind<br>there won't be as much loyalty having<br>said that technology may change that -<br>with augmented reality and virtual<br>reality if people can gain the similar<br>experience sitting at home but as if<br>they are actually right beside someone<br>being able to do this that social aspect<br>then that made that there there could be<br>some significant changes in so it may<br>not be right now but because at the<br>moment virtual reality's a lot of its<br>present clunky but but in the future<br>that could change significantly I mean<br>we might live in alone and there are the<br>virtual worlds here<br>yes yes stuff like that justly with<br>speech yeah just recently yeah<br>just under a doing is launching tech<br>week next week but it's a hologram of<br>just under a doing not herself so yeah<br>yeah the future is here I think I think<br>it was in France during the presidential<br>election yeah any other Christian<br>Christians that was really good one okay<br>we've kept you slightly over sorry enjoy<br>the rest of your evening them thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
