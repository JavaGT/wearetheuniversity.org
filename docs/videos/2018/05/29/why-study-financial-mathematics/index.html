font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>in the last decades significant<br>developments have happened in the<br>financial industry due to the use of<br>mathematics and statistics to create new<br>financial instruments the course on<br>financial mathematics which is offered<br>jointly by the Department of Mathematics<br>and the department of statistics at<br>stage three or postgraduate level<br>provides a thorough overview of<br>mathematical and statistical foundations<br>of Modern Portfolio Theory derivative<br>pricing and the theory of interest rate<br>Quan jobs in the financial service<br>industry make heavy use of complex<br>mathematical and statistical models for<br>instance on the buy side in hedge funds<br>people make use of statistical arbitrage<br>and machine learning in order to try and<br>gain that competitive advantage on the<br>sell side there is more focus on pricing<br>of derivatives and also on hedging risk<br>and for this people make heavy use of<br>stochastic partial differential<br>equations above all the most important<br>skill is the problem-solving skill there<br>is no better way to learn this under<br>study mathematics the other aspect of<br>the course that students find<br>particularly beneficial our guest<br>lectures from the financial industry in<br>my day-to-day work every trend actually<br>we undertake is underpinned by something<br>worth med medical model to be able to<br>have to stay in a situation and to<br>prepare it was critical<br>cease of any transaction we're looking<br>for employees we're looking for someone<br>who stands out the person who a<br>financial mathematics background offers<br>that point of difference students will<br>find the course a useful stepping stone<br>if they wish to pursue international<br>postgraduate financial mathematics<br>programs the course will also feature<br>the programming language our one thing<br>that's good about the course is that we<br>use this is open source software that's<br>been developed here actually at the<br>University of Auckland and is now spread<br>throughout the world there is enormous<br>scope for data analysis portfolios<br>option pricing it's the main vehicle<br>used to route the financial services<br>industry because it's open source and<br>it's incredibly comprehensive of course<br>we can't predict the future but we can<br>perhaps arrange to gain advantage from<br>it when it occurs so we can make<br>decisions today about how to set up a<br>portfolio or other investments so as to<br>structure the risks that we're taking<br>and advantages that we might gain from<br>them students come from the business<br>school of mathematics because it will<br>give them significant opportunities in<br>the workplace having that ability to<br>look at how a formula works to piece it<br>together bit by bit it's something that<br>I learned in 370 and I know that I use<br>that ability every day to help<br>supplement what my team's doing for<br>students who want to pursue a career in<br>the financial industry this course will<br>help you to stand out it will equip me<br>with the tool<br>necessary to work in a high-end sector<br>of the financial industry it will also<br>allow you the competitive advantage if<br>you want to study at postgraduate level<br>but secretly add internationally<br>recognized masters programs specialising<br>in mathematical finance<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
