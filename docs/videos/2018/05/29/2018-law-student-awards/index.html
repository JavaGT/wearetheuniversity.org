nationally and<br>internationally will mark the<br>achievements of our students who've won<br>prizes in scholarships<br>what they all have in common is hard<br>work commitment perseverance and a real<br>interest and enthusiasm for the law I'd<br>like to welcome all the students here<br>tonight who are receiving awards you've<br>done well and the members of the faculty<br>here join me in congratulating you I'd<br>like to welcome your family members and<br>close friends who are able to be here<br>this evening our students wouldn't have<br>achieved their success without your<br>support your encouragement and your love<br>and you can be very proud of all they've<br>achieved and in knowing that you've<br>helped make their success possible I'd<br>also like to welcome many of the<br>individuals and representatives of firms<br>and organizations who have donated<br>prizes and scholarships for our best<br>students who've supported our student<br>societies and the events and<br>competitions they organize and have<br>given financial assistance to the law<br>school and what we are trying to achieve<br>we are immensely grateful<br>the prizes scholarships and donations<br>you provide mean a lot to our students<br>they recognize the hard work the hours<br>spent in libraries staying up late at<br>night before exams seeking to master<br>particular cases legal principles and<br>areas of the law I'd like to welcome<br>members of the legal profession and<br>their judiciary who are here tonight<br>we're very grateful for the support<br>provided to us not only in financial<br>terms but also by helping and mentoring<br>students adjudicating moots and<br>competitions and supporting student and<br>faculty activities this is a very<br>successful law school national<br>and internationally we're currently<br>ranked the 29th best law school in the<br>world a considerable achievement give it<br>when you consider that there are more<br>than 5,000 law schools internationally<br>last year two of our students were named<br>the best and the third best speakers in<br>the world at the Jessup international<br>law moot this is the world's most<br>prestigious mooting competition and the<br>achievements of our students were truly<br>exceptional we're very proud of our<br>students and all they achieve several of<br>our Award winners are not here tonight<br>because they've commenced postgraduate<br>study at Harvard Stanford and other<br>leading universities one of our<br>graduates got the best result in the<br>Cambridge Master of Laws program last<br>year Auckland law school graduates have<br>topped the Oxford BC ell program two of<br>the last five years our students are<br>able to excel alongside the rest of the<br>world our graduates go on to have<br>diverse and interesting careers many are<br>leaders in the law Auckland law school<br>alumni comprise three of the five judges<br>of our highest court the Supreme Court<br>many of our graduates are leaders in<br>government business and other sectors<br>are struck by the fact that 15 percent<br>of the intake of new MPs after last<br>year's elections our Auckland Law School<br>alumni and I was also struck by the<br>somewhat staggering fact that 10% of all<br>MPs 1 and 10 our Auckland Law School<br>alumni as was the case in print in the<br>previous government we have alumni who<br>sit in cabinet who are ministers and who<br>hold<br>senior opposition portfolios so whether<br>you like or dislike what Parliament has<br>been doing we may share some of the<br>credit or blame we also have graduates<br>who contribute to the law into society<br>in all sorts of other ways from having<br>charge or make up major legal aid<br>program in Australia to representing<br>domestic workers in Hong Kong who have<br>been exploited and poorly treated and in<br>all sorts of other ways standing up for<br>those who are powerless who suffer<br>injustice and face barriers to receiving<br>the protection of the law<br>and the courts tonight is about<br>celebrating the achievements of some of<br>our most talented students and reminding<br>them to continue to work hard to excel<br>and to contribute as they progress in<br>their degrees their careers and their<br>lives and to thank all of you here for<br>the support you give them would you join<br>me in congratulating

done contract torts any of<br>the advanced legal competition and the<br>the final was superb to see last year<br>the winner of the sir justice Robert<br>Chambers memorial moot Bronwyn wild you<br>can see how many mooting competition and<br>other competitions we have from the<br>the first team that we have to<br>congratulate participated in the<br>Australia and New Zealand air law moot<br>competition they went to Adelaide to<br>compete and they were runners-up in the<br>Australasian competition<br>JAC garden received the award for the<br>best advocate in the competition and the<br>team also received the award for the<br>best respondent written memorial so if<br>we congratulate firstly the team members<br>jett garden and Fraser goloka Lee and<br>the coaches of the team henna read<br>and Nick Porter<br>we took part for the very first time in<br>the Frankfurt investment arbitration<br>moot and I thought the team did superbly<br>reaching the top third of the<br>competition in the very first year of<br>participating so congratulations to the<br>team members diana chu now in jena and<br>actually coming from the other direction<br>and the coach of the team checked davies<br>we have taken part for the last few<br>years and the International Chamber of<br>Commerce international commercial<br>mediation competition this is held in<br>Paris and this year's team were the<br>winners of the best creative solution<br>are used in the competition so if we<br>congratulate Victor Lee<br>rhe machinery Jun is Ian Apia Matthew<br>Jackson and the coaches of

several<br>years now in the William vez commercial<br>arbitration moot they'd actually<br>involves if you think that the other<br>teams I suppose these are really quite<br>transformative experiences for our<br>students coming up against international<br>competition are travelling to overseas<br>law schools to compete this team I think<br>gets the best deal because they got to<br>take part in for preliminary moots which<br>sort of works them up into match<br>condition they won the preliminary in<br>these preliminary moots involve very<br>large numbers of teams so our team won<br>the preliminary moots in Heidelberg and<br>Belgrade they were ranked 2nd and<br>Stockholm and food and Budapest's are<br>not a bad record in the preliminary<br>moots they then went to Vienna where<br>they

the coaches of the team<br>Kaitlyn Hollings<br>in Taylor gray<br>and again I think you can see from the<br>number of students you know that we do<br>have a really a very real presence in<br>international competitions and a large<br>number of students who get to benefit<br>from the opportunities the new entrant<br>prize winners receive book tokens and<br>these are awards that are awarded when<br>people are in their final year of<br>secondary school and they are applying<br>for places at the Auckland law school so<br>these are incredibly competitive Awards<br>people of what

winners to<br>very high achieving and again the the<br>fact that we only have nine scholarship<br>winners so out of those 1,400 students<br>nine scholarship winners again these are<br>people whose school results were quite<br>stellar please congratulate Benjamin<br>Christy Brittany Glasper Charlotte<br>McKenzie Dylan Brown<br>Talia Parker and Tiffany Chi<br>our guest speaker this evening is the<br>Honorable Christopher Finn listen QC and<br>MP Chrisman listen as someone who cares<br>deeply about the law about what it means<br>and about what it can achieve<br>he holds the highest rank as a lawyer<br>that of Queen's Counsel have been spent<br>25 years at Brandon Brookfield Bell<br>gully and then as a barrister during<br>which time he represented clients as<br>diverse as the ANZ Bradley Investments<br>the British government and the Sisters<br>of Mercy he represented NATO who in a<br>range of legal actions including suing<br>the Minister for treaty negotiations<br>slightly ironic given this as a position<br>he would later hold he's made seven<br>appearances in the Privy Council and<br>appeared in all of New Zealand's courts<br>his depth of legal experience includes<br>teaching Civil Procedure conflict of<br>laws and ethics and co-editing Magee<br>Kanaan procedure<br>I remember Chris coming and talking to a<br>public law class that I talked with<br>Philip Joseph when he was an opposition<br>MP and saying that the position that<br>most interested him in government was<br>that of attorney-general<br>it is an office in which he's been able<br>to deploy his understanding of the law<br>and the courts to great effect as<br>Attorney General for the last nine years<br>he's initiated a range of legal reforms<br>and has displayed an unwavering<br>commitment to the importance of the rule<br>of law and the independent bar<br>he appeared on behalf of New Zealand in<br>the International Court of Justice in<br>the whaling case and at the United<br>Nations Security Council to speak on<br>terrorism this is not to mention his<br>other day jobs throughout this period he<br>was also Minister for treaty<br>negotiations reforming the foreshore and<br>seabed legislation and signing 59 deeds<br>of settlement with E we including the<br>two high settlement and the Parihaka<br>apology the only large historical<br>settlement now remaining is with Ngapuhi<br>- who negotiator Tamati Kruger said the<br>Chrisman listener has an ability to<br>connect emotionally as well as<br>intellectually with what's going on and<br>he has a very fair assessment<br>of how things can proceed towards a<br>settlement easily we call him our friend<br>as one commentator said his legacy is<br>moving AR TR o and New Zealand towards<br>an honest future set free from the past<br>from 2014 until the formation of the new<br>government late last year Chris was also<br>Minister for the New Zealand security<br>intelligence service and Minister for<br>the government communication Security<br>Bureau portfolio's that until then had<br>traditionally been held by the Prime<br>Minister for six years he was also<br>Minister of arts culture and heritage to<br>face suffice to say the impact of his<br>public service has been immense to give<br>but one example 32 people have been<br>Attorney General of New Zealand but only<br>two others have held the office for<br>longer terms you have to go back 70<br>years to find one of the two people<br>who've held the office longer one of<br>Chris's legacies will continue to be<br>filled in all the courts of New Zealand<br>for some time to come if you just look<br>at our sitting judges Chris determined<br>the appointment of all of our Supreme<br>Court judges except the Chief Justice he<br>determined the appointment of all of our<br>Court of Appeal judges except one he<br>determined the appointment of 33 of the<br>47 High Court and associate court judges<br>he's had a critical role in shaping the<br>composition of our judiciary going<br>forward and in ensuring the talent and<br>diversity that are represented there it<br>gives me very great pleasure to ask you<br>to welcome the Honorable Christopher<br>Anderson<br>thank you very much Dean Andrew for that<br>a very generous / generous introduction<br>I've known Andrew for many years we were<br>members of the Victoria University<br>debating society and I have to say I've<br>watched with great pride his career over<br>the years he's been a first-class dean<br>of thus the best Faculty of Law in New<br>Zealand and that you are the 29th best<br>law school in the world and we should<br>just repeat that in the world is<br>attributable to his leadership his<br>scholarship and to the work of others on<br>the faculty can I acknowledge my old<br>friend Paul east Paul was the Attorney<br>General from 1990 to 1997 and held a<br>variety of portfolios he's a graduate of<br>this law school he was Minister of<br>Defense leader of the House Minister of<br>State Services and then served as our<br>High Commissioner in London he's now a<br>consultant at Bell gully one of my old<br>firms it's great to see you here tonight<br>Paul can I acknowledge my my old friend<br>justice lens Stevens I first got to know<br>Lyn in a very interesting piece of<br>Commerce Act litigation called Fletch<br>challenged in the Commerce Commission<br>and Lynn has served again this<br>university as pro Chancellor and has had<br>a great interest in the law school over<br>many years and served on the High Court<br>and the Court of Appeal he had probably<br>the shortest retirement in history he<br>retired from the Court of Appeal bench<br>and within 10 days I had phoned him and<br>said I really would appreciate it if you<br>could do the have locke north water<br>enquiry he spoke to his wife bad mistake<br>and said that he wanted a holiday first<br>but he did it and that piece of work<br>which was published last year is a very<br>important contribution on a massively<br>sensitive topic and can I acknowledge<br>all the other men<br>members of the profession here tonight<br>it's so good to see so many of you here<br>and to see that so many of you<br>contribute to this law school through<br>donating prizes and giving of your time<br>to help train people up I just want to<br>say something about Auckland University<br>I'm a graduate of Victoria I look I have<br>to say somewhat green with envy when I<br>see how well you do in so many areas and<br>I take for example mooting a couple of<br>years ago I was helping to prepare the<br>VIS moot team for I know it was the the<br>another international competition and<br>the quality of the people who were<br>preparing the submissions and presenting<br>them was truly remarkable<br>I think mr. grants off at Cambridge at<br>the moment but the quality was superb<br>and I'm not really surprised that you do<br>so well in all these competitions<br>because excellence is absolutely<br>essential to everything that you do and<br>I'm so very as I say envious of you<br>because I don't think my old law school<br>has got your record in fact Victor<br>Victoria University has got a very good<br>law school but I regret to say that<br>Auckland at the moment at least is<br>better and that's a massive that's a<br>massive concession on my part<br>it's it's interesting to look at the<br>names of the people who are recognized<br>for ever in some of these prizes and I<br>just I just sort of was looking through<br>the hamburger doesn't want to mention a<br>few because those of you who wouldn<br>these prizes should recognize that there<br>is a name behind the prize that person<br>made a massive contribution in his or<br>her own way to some aspect of the law so<br>for example I think of Jena Rhuddlan<br>there's a memorial prize to Jena Rutland<br>who died far too young a lawyer from<br>natty Perrault a tough and demanding<br>litigation lawyer gave me hell during<br>the fisheries allocation issues and I'm<br>really pleased that Jena Rutland's name<br>is going to live on through that<br>Memorial Prize because in her short time<br>at the law she died of cancer about 20<br>years ago far too young she made a<br>significant contribution to the law and<br>we wasn't always remember and never<br>forget the late Robert Chambers another<br>graduate of this University who did so<br>very well in every area of the law went<br>on the bench so briefly on the Supreme<br>Court I remember the afternoon I still<br>remember the afternoon I learned of Sir<br>Robert's death one of the saddest days<br>of my life had so much to give and we<br>will and must never forget him there's<br>the Martin Finley Memorial Scholarship<br>Martin Finley was a member of the Kirk<br>rolling administration and again a<br>graduate of us this law faculty he was<br>Attorney General from 1972 to 1975 and a<br>great legal scholar in his own right I<br>was most interested on page 7 of the the<br>booklet to see that a prize has been<br>donated in honor of a person called<br>Erica<br>papst and she was a very early graduate<br>I think of this law school I first came<br>across sister paps that she became she<br>became a nun and taught at this can<br>College formerly Sacred Heart College in<br>Island Bay and she was a remarkable<br>teacher two generations of students who<br>went to that college but she had studied<br>law and decided to give it up to go into<br>the church I'm still trying to work out<br>how it is that the New Zealand Society<br>of notaries incorporated have donated<br>the conflict of laws prize that conflict<br>of laws I declare an interest in the<br>conflict of laws it is the best subject<br>that anyone can study and I thoroughly<br>enjoyed my time as a student of<br>Professor Tony Angelo who taught me the<br>conflict of laws and 1978 in opposition<br>I've often been approached by some of my<br>colleagues about ideas for members bills<br>and I automatically go to dicey and<br>Morris to find some rarefied area of law<br>that they could perhaps introduce<br>legislation on and I've I found my<br>mother gone through Parliament private<br>international law choice of law in tort<br>bill and that was introduced by someone<br>who had never heard of private<br>international law but it was good for a<br>laugh I just want to say two things the<br>first thing is when I studied law at<br>Victoria University and it wasn't a<br>fault of Victoria University it was a<br>reality and the in the seventies there<br>was no course in intellectual property<br>there was no course in competition law<br>there was no course in environment law<br>and I remember study in public law there<br>was not one mention of the Treaty of<br>Waitangi in fact the most notable thing<br>about studying public law under<br>professor Quinton Baxter in the 1970s<br>was when professor Quinton Baxter<br>taught us about the reserved powers of<br>the governor-general and he said this<br>was in 1976 everyone slept through that<br>particular afternoon when I was teaching<br>the reserve powers of the<br>governor-general and then a few weeks<br>later Sir John Kerr fired Gough Whitlam<br>but nowadays of course any public law<br>Clause course that does not mention the<br>Treaty of Waitangi would be unthinkable<br>and so the message that I want to give<br>you tonight is that those of you who are<br>graduating from this university do not<br>think that you will not have to go on<br>learning because many of the subjects<br>that you will be practicing in in 20-25<br>years time may never have been heard of<br>and you are going to face above<br>wildering array of challenges in the<br>years to come whether you are working in<br>law firms or whether you are working in<br>policy and government or whatever the<br>law constantly changes the subject areas<br>will constantly change but the important<br>thing is that you have had a very strong<br>foundation in your years at this law<br>faculty that will make you more able to<br>adapt to new situations which you will<br>come across in years to come the second<br>point I want to make is that well what<br>I've said is absolutely true some<br>principles remain the same we must adapt<br>to changing times while holding fast to<br>unchanging principles the first one must<br>always be our never-ending commitment to<br>the rule of law that we are a society<br>governed by the law not individuals<br>every person no matter how rich or how<br>grand is a servant of the law and if<br>people step out of line they must be<br>brought within the law the second thing<br>is that there are some fundamental<br>two principles that underpin the kind of<br>society that we are a critical one is<br>the separation of powers and I have a<br>particular view about the separation of<br>powers it's something that people learn<br>about at law school but so often people<br>do not fully understand I don't wish to<br>be critical of the Ministry of Justice<br>but they don't seem to understand at<br>times that the judiciary is a separate<br>branch of government that judges are not<br>civil servants you may say well you<br>should enter mastermind your topic could<br>be the blatant obvious but this is<br>something that time in my nine years as<br>Attorney General I came across time and<br>time again sometimes and I say this with<br>the greatest of respect to judges<br>present judges don't understand the<br>separation of powers there was a<br>judgment released by the Supreme Court<br>some years ago that would have treated<br>parliamentary privilege as a species of<br>qualified privilege and in a rare burst<br>of multi partisanship we all got<br>together on the privileges committee<br>told the judges they were wrong and<br>passed the parliamentary privilege Act<br>that spelled out and clear terms what we<br>members of parliament said parliamentary<br>privilege was all about so there are<br>always going to be tensions between the<br>branches of government but the<br>separation of powers is something that<br>all lawyers should zealously guard and<br>protect because as I say it's not as<br>well understood in practical terms as it<br>should be so that's all I really wanted<br>to say tonight the the my final comment<br>is that when you look at the people<br>coming up here to receive prizes and<br>awards all I say to you to you people as<br>congratulations obviously but in the<br>years to come<br>adopt something as a piece of advice<br>that I was given some years ago that I<br>think is very good advice be generous to<br>others obviously but be<br>generous to yourself because when you<br>leave law school will you're already<br>under a lot of pressure and you go into<br>law firms or go and practice as junior<br>barristers or whatever you have to be<br>mindful that it's a long journey in<br>which you are engaged and look after<br>yourselves<br>I'm as the self-evident I am NOT a<br>fitness fanatic but I do strongly<br>believe in the importance of having time<br>out and not becoming a servant to the<br>law because if you become totally<br>dominated by the law and failed to take<br>into account the fantastic world that<br>there is around us notwithstanding<br>challenges that we face generation from<br>generation you won't live life to the<br>full and ultimately you won't achieve<br>what you're capable of achieving but<br>that's for the future for tonight<br>warmest congratulations all the very<br>best for the future a future that I'm<br>my thanks to Christopher Fenderson for<br>his comments and his insights not least<br>of which that Auckland is the best law<br>school and we didn't pay him to say that<br>so the end as a alumnus of Victoria<br>University myself I can fully endorse<br>what he says would the winners of and<br>with the winners and the recipients of<br>the undergraduate prizes and<br>scholarships please come up to the stage<br>up up until the JP Campbell prize<br>because there are so many undergraduate<br>Awards we're going to do this in two<br>groups so the winners of the<br>undergraduate prizes and scholarships up<br>up to and including the JP Campbell<br>prize once students have got through<br>first year and as I see that very<br>selective process to get into second<br>year law but they face the core<br>compulsory second second year subjects<br>these are the major areas of conceptual<br>thinking about the law in contracts<br>torts public law crimes land law and<br>equity and once they've completed the<br>compulsory subjects in jurisprudence and<br>legal ethics I should mention as well<br>among the compulsory subjects they go on<br>to the elective courses and we have<br>around 50 elective courses by far the<br>largest numbers of electives of any of<br>the New Zealand law schools and we're<br>very fortunate that individuals and<br>firms have sponsored prizes and<br>scholarships for a very large number of<br>these courses but at the expense of<br>making the ceremony longer you will<br>notice some some subjects aren't covered<br>so if any of you are feeling particular<br>generous at the end of the ceremony you<br>can certainly see me to remedy that the<br>first award is the AJ Davis scholarship<br>in law and the New Zealand Law Review<br>prize for the best results in first-year<br>law Genet a<br>the AJ Park<br>intellectual property law prize Marie<br>Cassidy the AJ Park intellectual<br>property law prize and the Wilson

other recipients of the<br>undergraduate scholarships and prizes<br>also come come forward to the stage and<br>this is where I realize I have nothing<br>to say just sort of fill in the gap as I<br>normally do but the fact that preps I<br>could say the fact that we have so many<br>prizes that we have to take a break is<br>obviously a good sign in so many<br>students have done so very well but<br>always room for more the Johnston<br>foundation prizes in company law we have<br>two winners<br>the first is Alexandre Benson<br>and also mani Sharma the judge<br>Avinash do booked Memorial

recipients of<br>the postgraduate prizes and scholarships<br>please come to the side of the stage we<br>have a very successful Master of Laws<br>program we also offer a master of Legal<br>Studies for those who don't have a prior<br>law degree and the law faculty also<br>hosts the master of Taxation Studies<br>degree and together in fact even if you<br>just take the LLM the Master of Laws<br>program the success of our program is<br>such that we have more master of law<br>students than all of the New Zealand law<br>schools all of the other New Zealand law<br>schools combined so it really is a very<br>big program and I think part of its<br>success is each year we bring in a raft<br>of overseas scholars from a number of<br>the leading law schools and other parts<br>of the world to teach into the program<br>alongside our own faculty and<br>practitioners but as you'll see we only<br>have a few postgraduate prizes so this<br>really is an opportunity begging so<br>again if you know anyone who would like<br>to contribute to a prize or award we<br>have some really talented masters<br>students so we'd like to give more of<br>those but if we now can congratulate the<br>gays
