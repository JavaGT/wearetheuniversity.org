welcome you all and I see that we<br>have a lot of people from Faculty of<br>science and engineering and from<br>Business School and thank you for coming<br>to this wonderful event before we start<br>just a few health and safety<br>announcement so exits are right in the<br>back in case of emergency get out of<br>there and get to the veneered straight<br>and I'm sure the building is very well<br>designed so you can find bathrooms or<br>not a problem<br>so today the talk is about product<br>design and we have wonderful street<br>speaker Andrew la from Netflix and so I<br>know many of you probably used mobile<br>devices for streaming videos and all<br>kinds of content and andrew is the one<br>who is behind all that so in case your<br>device or streaming is not working you<br>know who to call so I was just in white<br>Andrew now thank you thank you<br>awesome so just a little bit of contact<br>setting I'm gonna do a presentation<br>that's roughly 25 30 minutes and then we<br>want to open it up for questions so if<br>you have those burning questions about<br>Netflix how we work how we develop our<br>product please get them ready and I'll<br>be happy to answer as many of them as<br>possible towards the end before we get<br>started I want to show we are a<br>streaming company so I'm going to play a<br>video from YouTube but it's a it's when<br>we made hopefully the audio works and is<br>yeah<br>so that's a video that we made for a<br>feature that we created called cold<br>smart downloads which launched not too<br>long ago and that's the type of<br>innovation work that my team is<br>responsible for specifically on mobile<br>as well as the website so those are my<br>two kind of areas of responsibility so I<br>gave this talk earlier today I've been<br>talking for like five hours but I'm<br>really excited to be able to share some<br>of the stuff with you guys and hopefully<br>have a conversation about it I got into<br>design about 14 years ago I started<br>doing very very small projects just kind<br>of for fun so I did things like posters<br>for friends bands and album covers and<br>t-shirts and and fun things like that<br>before I ever knew that this was going<br>to be my career I was sitting in seats<br>very similar to this back at San Jose<br>State which is where I went to school<br>and I went to business school and I have<br>a degree in business marketing and<br>administration but I used very little of<br>my degree don't worry you guys will but<br>a lot of kind of what got me into design<br>was really wanting to understand why<br>people make the decisions that they make<br>and how I could influence those<br>decisions through design so I'm gonna be<br>talking a little bit about failure today<br>specifically failure at Netflix and how<br>that leads us to building better global<br>products and there's three different<br>areas that I'm going to talk about I'm<br>going to talk about a/b testing what<br>that is and how it works and why we<br>employ it research the different types<br>of research that we cover and I want to<br>talk about empathy empathy is extremely<br>important because I'm from the Silicon<br>Valley a lot of my design team is from<br>North America but we're building a<br>global product for 190 countries or over<br>a hundred and thirty million members in<br>22 different languages but we are not<br>representative of the people that we're<br>actually building our products for<br>anymore so how do we build empathy along<br>the way so that we build the best<br>products possible sound good all right<br>this was supposed to be moving so this<br>last 20 seconds so we'll just<br>we do lots of shows how many people here<br>use Netflix okay that's what I like to<br>okay so if we just document the people<br>that need to pay I can accept all forms<br>of credit that's great so so I want to<br>talk a little bit about product design<br>and that's that's kind of my field<br>that's my that's where my expertise are<br>so the product designers job at Netflix<br>is to find if there's a bear there and<br>what I mean by that is find that there's<br>an opportunity that's going to grow the<br>business and that's really my team's job<br>so we don't just push pixels we don't<br>just create pretty things that are<br>usable we identify different areas of<br>opportunity inside the existing business<br>and potentially outside the existing<br>business and then we build prototype<br>test and do qualitative and quantitative<br>research to better understand if that's<br>something that we should actually roll<br>out to our members smart downloads being<br>an example of that so let's say that<br>that we're all product designers at<br>Netflix congratulations on your new job<br>this is a bigger team than I've ever had<br>before this is great so how do you take<br>an idea and actually validate it so how<br>do you take something and understand<br>whether it's something you should pursue<br>or something that you should kind of let<br>fall by the wayside I kind of use this<br>rough rough structure as a framework so<br>the first thing you want to do is try to<br>identify an opportunity I'm gonna use<br>smart downloads because that's the video<br>that I showed earlier so we've already<br>had a download feature in in the app it<br>worked but there was a I was a highly<br>manual process you'd go in you'd find<br>something you'd click download you'd<br>wait for it to download and then you'd<br>hopefully consume it later so we thought<br>that there was an opportunity for this<br>when we started looking at the data of<br>how many people are using downloads and<br>how they're actually using it so we had<br>an idea and it was this idea of smart<br>downloads we didn't really know what it<br>was going to be at that at the time but<br>we asked ourselves does that align to<br>our business objectives and we want more<br>people to be able to use our product in<br>situations where they have little or no<br>connectivity so we said yeah like that<br>actually aligns with our business goals<br>does it mean a user need absolutely<br>through a lot of the research that we<br>did we discovered that people oftentimes<br>are not using the North American use<br>case which is what we think of where hey<br>maybe I'll use downloads if I go on a<br>flight or<br>I'm in the subway or something like that<br>we study people that are in Mumbai and<br>in Singapore that have connectivity<br>sometimes but it's really spotty at best<br>and sometimes people are spending three<br>hours in a car commuting to and from<br>work so they absolutely there was a user<br>need how large is that need so it can be<br>a need it can be a valid thing but if<br>only a subset of your members are using<br>that or would use it is it actually<br>meaningful for you probably not probably<br>not so it's probably not something you<br>actually want to pursue and then the<br>opportunity costs we do not we do not<br>have finite resources we have a small<br>number of people from the design side we<br>have a smaller engineering team so we<br>have to reprioritize so is it is it<br>worth the opportunity cost because you<br>if you can do this you can't do this<br>oftentimes and if it aligns then you<br>shouldn't you should absolutely do it<br>and pursue so once you have the idea how<br>do you actually take that and and build<br>it how do you take it from zero to one<br>the skill is not in coming up with the<br>ideas okay the skill isn't executing the<br>ideas everybody in here has ideas some<br>of you will pursue them some of the you<br>will throw caution to the wind and<br>absolutely go for them and others are<br>just going to have good ideas that never<br>get out the door and everything is in<br>execution so we use this framework to<br>basically and it's it's very idealistic<br>it doesn't always happen exactly in this<br>way so take it with a little bit with a<br>grain of salt all kind of caveat when<br>when sometimes we like spin backwards<br>and come back to ideas but we try to<br>start with what we know so with the data<br>that we had we realized for smart<br>downloads that there was this behavior<br>where people would watch a few episodes<br>usually about three or sorry downloaded<br>about three episodes they would then<br>consume them often when they were not<br>connected to Wi-Fi and then they would<br>redo that same thing when they were<br>connected to Wi-Fi again so there's an<br>opportunity there anytime you have a<br>repetitive process there's an<br>opportunity for innovation to take some<br>of the weight off of the user and for us<br>to do that work for them and that's what<br>smart download says<br>so there was a foundational research<br>that was done so you you have to start<br>out with what you need but you also have<br>to ask yourself what other information<br>do I lack so where are the gaps in in my<br>hypothesis where the gaps in my thinking<br>and how can I fill those and again ask<br>yourself if there's that they are there<br>the next step is to ID eight ideation<br>for us looks like kind of a very very<br>broad and we start in a bunch of<br>different directions because we don't<br>know exactly where where we want to go<br>and we want to explore and and not leave<br>any stone unturned so what we will kind<br>of will kind of take a very kind of wide<br>I guess brushstroke approach at the<br>beginning of something and then narrow<br>that down through different qualitative<br>research methods the next step is to<br>prototype and learn it's extremely<br>important that if you're going to show<br>something from a personalized service<br>like Netflix that it's as accurate as<br>possible so we have prototypes where we<br>can actually sign in with your unique<br>IDs and show you content that is<br>familiar to you including the last<br>things that you've watched but it's all<br>in kind of a prototype so it's it's all<br>in a build that no one else has access<br>to but through that process we'll try to<br>get the most realistic understanding of<br>how impactful that feature or idea is to<br>you the number oftentimes what we'll see<br>in qualitative research we actually have<br>to turn into actionable insights so some<br>of those things when they synthesize the<br>learnings we'll come back and say<br>actually you know what when we when we<br>explore something like smart downloads<br>we should really be mindful of<br>conserving data so we should we should<br>maybe be conservative and do this is<br>something that's only while you're<br>connected to Wi-Fi which is exactly what<br>we did and that's a learning that came<br>from that process from that project as<br>well a Netflix we do a/b testing and a<br>lot of people understand a/b testing as<br>kind of if you take a user and you drop<br>them on website a or website B which one<br>performed better that is a very very<br>basic approach of a/b testing<br>we do multivariate testing which means<br>that we'll have 12 upwards of 12 to 20<br>different cells to identify each<br>individual variable so not only will I<br>be able to understand why website B<br>worked best but exactly what nuance of<br>that design outperform the other and<br>then why so I'll talk a little bit about<br>more about a/b testing in a couple<br>slides and then again once you actually<br>have something that you've learned is<br>meaningful for our members it's<br>something that we will productize I was<br>doing a talk earlier today to project<br>managers and product managers group and<br>this is where there's a little bit of<br>friction between design and PM's design<br>wants to do what's right for the user<br>and usually PM is want to do what's<br>right for the business and so they're<br>they're oftentimes they're concessions<br>that are made around around when you're<br>gonna actually productize something and<br>ship it to your members and then if you<br>if that all works you do it again so to<br>to have a culture of testing you have to<br>support it from every single level Reed<br>Hastings our CEO started the company<br>back in 1997<br>shipping DVDs in the u.s. mail<br>everyone's pretty young in here so a DVD<br>I'm just gonna so that's how the company<br>that's how the company started and he<br>was really interested in understanding<br>where where that where that could go so<br>you know could that scale could that go<br>globally they they really kind of<br>encouraged everyone in the company to<br>explore ways that the company could<br>continue to grow in scale and so the the<br>level of the lever the level of that<br>culture is really embedded in who we are<br>as as Netflix errs anybody can come up<br>with an idea and inside of our freedom<br>and responsibility culture you have the<br>opportunity to go explore it if you if<br>that's something that<br>you think is actually meaningful so I've<br>done projects again<br>I have a business degree but I've done<br>projects that had no design no pixels at<br>all and tried to understand if that was<br>material for us as a business but inside<br>of that at Netflix there are no sacred<br>cows and every now and then you need to<br>make a hamburger we didn't get to where<br>we're at today because we thought DVDs<br>by mail were the right way to go we got<br>to where we're at today because we<br>thought it was the wrong way to go and<br>we challenged our own assumptions and so<br>we just we disrupted initially<br>brick-and-mortar blockbuster stores<br>we're gonna go rent a DVD and then we<br>created you know streaming and and made<br>the other thing and expanded that out to<br>North America and then we licensed more<br>and more content to make sure that we<br>had things that everyone in here would<br>like to watch and then when that got<br>really expensive we started investing in<br>our own content and creating Netflix<br>originals and so we continued to disrupt<br>ourselves and the next kind of phase of<br>what that looks like is hopefully<br>disrupting storytelling so the reason<br>that everybody watches a 30-minute show<br>and you really only get twenty two<br>minutes of that is because the<br>advertisers had an eight minute adblock<br>we will never have ads I'll say that<br>right here now you will never see an ad<br>on Netflix and because we don't have<br>that we can really support the stories<br>that people want to tell in any fashion<br>and format that they want to tell it so<br>if we want to tell something that's<br>culturally sensitive we can tell that<br>because again we're not appealing to<br>advertisers we're appealing to you our<br>members and if you like it then you'll<br>tell us you'll watch it and if not then<br>we'll probably end up making less of<br>that type of content in the future so a<br>be testing again this is we test<br>everything that is in the product today<br>so everyone in here is probably in<br>twenty or so a B tests right now and you<br>just don't know it so you know your<br>Netflix experience is vastly different<br>from your Netflix experience and<br>hopefully you guys don't compare notes<br>but why do we do it so it really helps<br>us rule out those those bad ideas and<br>focus on larger more risky product bets<br>the earlier you can get a read on<br>something whether you should actually<br>pursue it or not the better because<br>we're talking about time we're talking<br>about money and we're talking about<br>resources and we want to conserve<br>whenever possible we apply the<br>scientific approach this is why we do<br>multivariate testing because we want to<br>isolate each of the individual variables<br>to understand what worked and why or<br>what didn't work and why because<br>ultimately a failure is not a failure as<br>long as you learn something and we test<br>large ideas we don't test like the color<br>of a button so we would never have a<br>test that is really kind of like nuanced<br>into like typography or the granularity<br>of you know iconography even we'll get a<br>lot of sense of that just because of the<br>fact that all my designers have been<br>designing for so long that we understand<br>what people are going to be able to<br>gravitate to what patterns people are<br>going to understand and be able to adapt<br>to and learn and one of the really<br>important things with a/b testing is you<br>want to understand what success looks<br>like before you start so it's really<br>easy when you run a B test and you get<br>green results or if you get a win as we<br>call it to just like not ask any other<br>questions and just ship that out but<br>it's really difficult when something<br>doesn't work if you haven't asked<br>yourself why you might think it won't<br>work before you go into it so make sure<br>you understand what success is before<br>you run the tests and failure is<br>absolutely only the beginning if I had a<br>scoreboard behind me<br>tallying my wins and my losses I would<br>have far more in the lost column than in<br>column but all of those things all of<br>those failures helped me to learn and<br>helped me to get better and produce<br>those wins so I still look at them as<br>failures but I was able to glean some<br>kind of insight out of that which is why<br>so as I mentioned before we're 190<br>countries 22 languages with 130 million<br>members we are not representative of the<br>people that we're designing for anymore<br>so we really can't start with this as<br>our basis anymore this worked for a<br>while when most of the Netflix business<br>was inside the United States it's no<br>longer were a fully international<br>company so we really have to be mindful<br>of not just this and not just these<br>which is where a lot of companies will<br>tend to focus and spend their their<br>dollars and this is where we focus it<br>originally as well but you have to<br>expand into LATAM and understand the<br>cultural nuances and family structures<br>you have to understand outside of that<br>as well the rest of the world and<br>understanding multi-generational<br>households in India and how one piece of<br>content - one family member will not be<br>accepted by another and so when we do<br>when we go and do research oftentimes we<br>will spend time in people's homes we'll<br>spend entire days with people shadowing<br>them around and just seeing how they use<br>their phone how they use the website how<br>they use the internet for entertainment<br>to try to understand and identify<br>opportunities that again will grow the<br>business this is by far the thing that<br>keeps me up at night the most it's a<br>huge challenge we have last year we<br>spent six billion dollars on content<br>this year we're spending more were just<br>about the largest studio in the world<br>and with all of that stuff coming to the<br>surface hopefully there's something<br>that's great for everybody in this room<br>but how do you deliver the right thing<br>at the right time to the right person in<br>the right context that's a huge<br>challenge and that causes me many<br>so like I was saying some of the<br>research that we do we're really trying<br>to build empathy through that research<br>that's why we try to get on the ground<br>as much as possible and meet folks and<br>talk to them what works well for them<br>what doesn't why we try to find out<br>hacky ways that people are using the<br>service that we never would have thought<br>of before we have a share button in in<br>the app but a lot of people will take a<br>screenshot and like SMS that to a friend<br>so we want to understand why why are<br>they doing that why aren't they using<br>the affordance it's right there and how<br>can we support that behavior if we feel<br>like it's something that we should we<br>should model so empathy is a muscle just<br>like any other it can be built stronger<br>and shaped over time I have learned a<br>lot a lot from my team in the last<br>couple years about empathy and I've seen<br>a lot of and heard a lot of great<br>stories that have helped me to kind of<br>bond and that's really what it is we we<br>do a lot of travel we do a lot of<br>research with participants and we do a<br>lot of person on the street interviews<br>to again glean some sort of insight into<br>somebody else's perspective in life and<br>that helps us to be better product<br>designers we're flying through this by<br>the way well plenty of time for<br>questions so really understanding<br>someone's frame of reference can lead to<br>meaningful innovation this would have<br>been kind of scoffed at even a few years<br>ago if you just put this up on a screen<br>but we can prove it through the the<br>success that we've had in the product by<br>understanding and cleaning insights from<br>someone's life and then mirroring that<br>back in the product to create an<br>experience that is meaningful when<br>you've emphasized you tap into emotions<br>and you bond over those shared feelings<br>and experiences as a little kid in North<br>America we always do like summer kind of<br>summer camp so we'll go out into the<br>woods with other kids and we you know<br>have tents and campfires and all those<br>things and what was great about those is<br>the bonding experience that you'd have<br>with those other kids you'd have a<br>shared experience and you'd often come<br>back to your siblings you come back to<br>your family and they wouldn't be as<br>excited as you were you didn't really<br>why it's because you were building<br>empathy with those kids you were<br>building an understanding you you had<br>that shared emotional connection an<br>emotional bond<br>I would like to replicate that as much<br>as possible with as many people as I can<br>so that I create a diverse perspective<br>of understanding and then I can actually<br>use that in material ways for the<br>business everyone in here has biases<br>there's some amazing tests that you can<br>do to identify your unconscious bias but<br>you really need to understand these if<br>you're a designer if this will help you<br>immensely if you're not a designer if<br>you're just trying to be a good human<br>this will also help you we all have our<br>biases I was really surprised to learn<br>what some of mine are I won't share them<br>with you<br>but the first thing is really awareness<br>and you can do things to kind of curb<br>them over time and this is really<br>important you don't do empathy you have<br>empathy it is something that you have to<br>make a conscious effort about you have<br>to employ it on a daily basis and again<br>being aware being conscious of it is<br>going to help you and you're absolutely<br>gonna going to mess this up that's okay<br>I think that the more people you are<br>able to meet and the more people you're<br>able to connect with is gonna eventually<br>lead to you being a more well rounded<br>human and again if you're if your goal<br>is to create a business or build<br>products for people this is a skill that<br>you really should be developing now okay<br>research types this is I have two slides<br>left so noise is extremely common in<br>research and you have to know that going<br>in because you want to take things with<br>a grain of salt people are terrible at<br>predicting their own behavior if I asked<br>if I pointed in one of you and asked<br>what would you do<br>you know tonight after after this is<br>done you're gonna tell me something and<br>it at most at best it's gonna be<br>aspirational because I'm asking you in a<br>room like this you might say something<br>like you're gonna go home and watch a<br>documentary when really you're gonna go<br>watch Cupcake Wars so we're really bad<br>at predicting our own behavior<br>or even worse at socializing what that<br>is so you have to understand that when<br>you go into a research scenario that you<br>have you have to be looking for kind of<br>more the themes than the actual words<br>that people are saying so I've mentioned<br>this a little bit<br>the research that we tend to employ<br>especially the beauty of a project is<br>more ethnographic in nature this is<br>great to get a foundational basis of<br>understanding we did this pretty<br>recently in Japan before that we did it<br>in Singapore because we were seeing<br>patterns of behavior that were kind of<br>anomalies like it just didn't make sense<br>the data wasn't telling us the complete<br>story and so we traveled there and and<br>met with folks and talk to them and<br>spent time in their homes with their<br>families to better understand how they<br>were using service the first one can be<br>quite expensive the second one is you<br>can do this on a shoestring budget I<br>still do this today even as a designer<br>in a corporation I think that this is a<br>really really meaningful and powerful<br>way of connecting with people and we<br>just call it personal on the street<br>interviews this is you see someone on<br>the phone you walk up to them you<br>introduce yourself you say to your<br>student that's what I always say they<br>still believe me like I'm going back to<br>school or something I say that I'm a<br>student and I'm doing a research project<br>and I just like to understand how<br>they're using their phone for<br>entertainment and then you just have a<br>conversation with that person and and<br>you don't have any objectives other than<br>to just learn and listen to them we<br>often give them like a $5 Starbucks gift<br>card or something as well video diaries<br>so if you can't travel you can do<br>different types of recruiting in<br>different countries where you ask them<br>to do a certain kind of step-by-step<br>process so we might send them phones or<br>we might have them download an early<br>build of our app and then they'll use it<br>for a few weeks so that it's not just<br>this labs lab scenario and that's the<br>last one but it's not so it's a labs<br>like an artificial home scenario we want<br>people to be able to use it in their<br>daily lives and see if it's a behavior<br>that becomes repetitive<br>for them and the last is lab sessions we<br>typically use these early on in the<br>process and at the end of the process<br>and a real quick note anybody who's<br>taking pictures like go for it totally<br>it's totally fine I will post this whole<br>deck to my website so that you can get<br>everything you get the speaker notes and<br>everything else so just know that and we<br>employ lab sessions at two different<br>times early on in the process when we're<br>when we're trying to get a good gut<br>check of the direction of taking<br>something and then later on in the<br>process when we want to do a usability<br>study or a usability qual that's what we<br>call them to really understand we want<br>to see that if we create a new feature<br>it's usable but our user base is not is<br>not you know 18 to 24 males or our user<br>base is three-year-olds 293 year olds<br>and so we have to create things that are<br>going to work well not only for you know<br>people in Palo Alto that are tech savvy<br>or people here that are tech savvy but<br>it's got to work for again that<br>multi-generational household in Mumbai<br>that I mentioned before so I know all of<br>you are students you've probably had a<br>long day so we'll end it there I do<br>offer if anybody has questions if you<br>are looking how to launch your career if<br>you want to get into design I do offer<br>mentorship it's free it's unlimited it<br>might take a little bit of time for me<br>to get back to you given the time<br>difference but if you ever have any<br>questions or anything like that my email<br>is up there and my Twitter is up there<br>feel free to to reach out people poured<br>a lot of time and attention into me and<br>my career getting getting to the place<br>that I am today and I want to give back<br>as much as I can so any questions that<br>you guys have I'm happy to fuel them<br>here if it's something you don't want to<br>ask in front of a crowd feel free to<br>email me or DM me on Twitter and I will<br>happy happily get back to you thank you<br>very much<br>we have a few minutes for questions and<br>we'll take questions from anyone when<br>you do do multivariate testing what kind<br>of been done sample size are you looking<br>at so that's that's great question so if<br>anybody didn't hear when we do<br>multivariate testing what's the sample<br>size that we're looking at<br>we typically allocate a few million<br>members to each cell which again is not<br>it's not feasible for everybody to do<br>that but we're at relatively small scale<br>compared to something like an Amazon<br>where they can turn on an a/b test and<br>turn it off five minutes later and and<br>have you know millions of impressions of<br>a page or something like that so we want<br>to because it's also because of our our<br>structure that we offer like a free<br>30-day trial so we need to make sure<br>that someone comes to the service and<br>then retains as a member past that first<br>pay period to determine whether that's<br>at me a successful product feature or<br>idea or not we want to make sure that<br>they stay paying members yeah thanks a<br>question oh sorry I'm here so how do you<br>identify your biases so there's a lot of<br>tests that you can take and just go<br>online and search unconscious bias<br>I think Harvard has a few different<br>tests and they're really easy it's<br>basically time and reaction based so<br>they might show you a picture and then<br>ask you a question and it's all about<br>like how quickly you can answer these<br>questions to try to uncover some of<br>these unconscious biases that you have<br>but just do a google search you'll<br>you'll find there's tons of tests so how<br>do you find a good product designers and<br>how do you hire local a reasonable<br>that's a great question so my job is<br>basically building the best team that I<br>can giving them the right context the<br>right resources and then getting<br>out of the way and letting them do their<br>job so I spend a lot of time looking for<br>diversity of thought I know from<br>researchers has shown that the more<br>diverse team the more likely you are to<br>succeed so I try to get people with<br>diverse perspectives it's very hard and<br>trumps America to hire people from<br>outside of the US but it is something<br>that I have I currently have a<br>centralized design team where everybody<br>kind of sits in one location I'm often<br>kind of exploring the idea of hiring<br>people in our India office hiring people<br>from Amsterdam in our Amsterdam office<br>and having a decentralized team to get<br>that diversity but a great question hi<br>I'm just always what do you test in your<br>a be testing all the multivariate<br>testing so you mentioned that you don't<br>of course test the color of the button<br>or whatever but what do you test is it<br>usually the type of content that they<br>prepare to watch no that's a great<br>question so for the the feature that I<br>showed called smart downloads a test<br>cell might look like the number of<br>episodes that we download automatically<br>for you so it's basically and we<br>actually tested this we tested whether<br>we should automatically download like<br>three episodes for that viewer or<br>another test cell was we'll just we'll<br>download as many episodes as you've<br>consumed and then another test cell<br>might be will download as many episodes<br>as you started to download so if you<br>downloaded one will delete one and swap<br>that back in if you downloaded three and<br>you watch three then we'll delete three<br>so that it's just things like different<br>larger ideas that we're trying to<br>understand which of those aspects of the<br>feature are successful that answer your<br>question it's it's not a it's not a<br>really easy concept I wish that there<br>was like a you know straight way of<br>talking about it it is and in that test<br>we had twelve different cells that we're<br>doing those things so I'm not a<br>professional that's up I have amazing<br>science algorithm folks that help us to<br>kind of go through and identify every<br>nuance that we want to test isolate<br>those variables across the cells and<br>then we might actually product size<br>something that has a little bit of cell<br>8 a little bit of cell 5 and a little<br>bit of cell to someone is always<br>controlled which is your current<br>experience yeah you mentioned the<br>challenge of becoming global a global<br>company one of the things of course with<br>content is that some content in some<br>countries will be offensive or not want<br>it and another currency fine<br>so how do you manage that challenge like<br>do you prevent some countries from<br>watching certain things or what you do<br>there so the only way that we prevent<br>people from watching things are would be<br>because of a licensing deal so the the<br>catalog is not the same in every region<br>around the world usually because of that<br>Netflix original should be available<br>just about anywhere in the world except<br>for some of our first few originals that<br>were hard for us to licence but no we<br>know we don't gate or filter or censor<br>or anything like that we want to provide<br>as much information in the UI to allow<br>that individual to make a good decision<br>for themselves so we don't want to bait<br>and switch and tell you that it's hey<br>this isn't graphic when it really is we<br>want to provide as much that information<br>up upfront and we actually work with<br>government agencies to kind of<br>standardized rating systems so that we<br>can actually tell different governments<br>hey this is this is how you should be<br>thinking about this type of content and<br>then they'll kind of use that in country<br>to figure out if that's actually right<br>and then we'll build trust with them<br>over time so that where we're trying to<br>pick up those cultural sensitivities as<br>well it's not a perfect system it's<br>getting better yeah hi in your<br>experience with product design what<br>technical skills and soft skills do you<br>think are important for like this level<br>for my role no skills oh so you're<br>little and like they're all in<br>so hard so hard skills and soft skills<br>so the hard skills look like software<br>programs that you use so Photoshop<br>illustrators sketch some sort of<br>prototyping tool like framer which uses<br>CoffeeScript or invision which if you go<br>on envisions website you'll see me all<br>over it any any of those those are the<br>hard skills that you need the soft<br>skills that I find that are really<br>really valuable<br>our sales skills marketing skills<br>because it's not the best design that<br>gets built it's the one that was<br>socialized the best and sold the best<br>and I don't mean sold to like other<br>people in a in a you know used car sales<br>way I mean you're positioning right<br>you're trying to position why this is<br>impactful why this is meaningful and you<br>want to create a case around that so I<br>find that people that are have had some<br>kind of sales background even if they<br>were a kid or something like that and<br>you know sold cookies by the side of the<br>road it's it's beneficial in it and it<br>plays out and it kind of pays dividends<br>as well<br>great question yeah so how do you choose<br>which countries have other offices<br>because it's an international<br>organization so yeah so we basically<br>created regional offices to handle kind<br>of content in a specific region so we<br>have offices in London and Amsterdam<br>that handle a lot of Europe we have<br>London's we have offices in Brazil that<br>handles a lot of latam Mexico City so<br>it's more regional it's not about like<br>hey this country is really important<br>let's make sure we have an office there<br>it's just more general than that but<br>there are a lot of it is content place<br>as well we want to make sure that there<br>are people that are representative of<br>those markets that are buying content<br>for those regions as well so when you're<br>designing your product do you design in<br>sequence in terms of if you're designing<br>for the desktop and the mobile<br>application or do you do it<br>simultaneously what is your process<br>the platform yeah that's a great<br>question so we are not really rigid<br>around having a unified product<br>experience on all the platforms at the<br>same time and actually because we're a<br>very iterative culture and because we're<br>always doing different tests often times<br>my iOS app and my Android app wanting to<br>actually be the same and that's okay<br>like me just that's something that we're<br>just because we want to iterate because<br>we want to kind of do these things<br>really quickly that's just something<br>that we have to kind of own so there are<br>features where if you're an iOS device<br>today or if you're an Android device<br>today you're gonna have kind of<br>different things that we've rolled out<br>and what we'll do is we'll test on one<br>platform that has the resources for it<br>we'll take our learnings and we'll do a<br>holdback test on the other platform to<br>understand if it has any negative<br>implications on that platform and if not<br>them then we'll have kind of unification<br>but again we're always kind of doing<br>this stair step yeah great question<br>how much variation do you find between<br>different user bases like and can you<br>what do you mean hold on don't get it<br>Mike Beckett what do you mean by user<br>bases like for example different age<br>groups different regions different<br>gender a lot different platforms yeah so<br>I we don't have<br>gender information it's not something<br>that we typically I don't think we<br>collect that in our signup flow or<br>anything like that we would only have<br>like an email address to go off of and I<br>don't think we're parsing those to try<br>to figure out if that's a male or female<br>so I can talk a little bit more about<br>like the platform stuff so there's often<br>this question of like well hey you know<br>iOS has a platform and they have<br>standards and they have design patterns<br>and Android has a platform and they have<br>standards and they have design patterns<br>shouldn't you create two different<br>experiences one that satisfies these and<br>ones that satisfies these because<br>there's different use cases and<br>different user needs we've tested that<br>many different times in many different<br>cases and found that not too<br>case at least for Netflix so our<br>navigation pattern in both of our apps<br>are the same we do not have an action<br>bar for Android that's at the top and a<br>tab navigation bar for iOS that's at the<br>bottom we have a tab navigation bar for<br>both and so so a lot of times people<br>think that there are different reasons<br>once we test those to better understand<br>it and often find that there are not<br>that larger differences it's it's more<br>so on the content side like people are<br>very different with the types of stuff<br>they like to watch which make sense yeah<br>what do you guys have against movie<br>trailers or am i in a test cell wait<br>what do we have against that you mean<br>they banished from my Netflix<br>where were you seeing where are you<br>seeing them when like navigating down<br>and opening like the info on the website<br>yeah here it says so go Google and<br>you'll find you'll find mr. Ahlers sorry<br>I was just wondering if sorry<br>do you use aqua types or personas if so<br>how and do you iterate on them we do not<br>use them they kind of I know designers<br>that do enjoy them and it helps to kind<br>of get a frame of reference to begin<br>with but I think that those are often<br>just generalizations and it's better to<br>really actually like go out and meet<br>someone and then build a kind of a case<br>study around an actual person then then<br>those generalizations there's there's<br>lots of designers like you can ask 10<br>different designers and they'll tell you<br>10 different reasons why they love those<br>or hate those but my team doesn't use<br>those or employ those in any way I don't<br>know who has the mic so if you have a<br>mic you can ask a question you mentioned<br>that everyone at netflix has the<br>opportunity to innovate and obviously<br>it's a massive company so you've got<br>engineering teams and analytics teams<br>and design teams so how do you deal with<br>the tension between a great idea that<br>comes from a design perspective and the<br>engineering side over vice-versa where<br>you have a innovation from an<br>engineering side but it doesn't make<br>design sense how do you guys decide and<br>deal with that tension yeah it always<br>comes down to opportunity size what to<br>one of my like first or second slides if<br>you think of it like a funnel and you<br>drew at the top of the funnel you drew<br>130 130 million right that's that's our<br>member base if you use something that<br>only is no in effect a small subset of<br>those whether it's engineering or design<br>driven we're probably not going to<br>prioritize that work over something<br>that's going to affect a larger<br>population of folks so it's really it's<br>a give-and-take there's concessions all<br>the time that are made but it's it's<br>oftentimes a conversation it's it's not<br>like argumentative I think wolf as long<br>as you come as long as you come up with<br>an idea that is in the best interest of<br>the business<br>and the user it's probably going to get<br>built at some point but it's just a<br>prioritization game yeah you mentioned<br>testing against success criteria and<br>defining the success criteria really<br>clearly up front not only examples where<br>you've defined what you believed success<br>was and asked that test or gone-gone<br>live for the product and then realized<br>you were actually testing against the<br>wrong success criteria and if so what<br>are some of the common floors second<br>question what are the common floors and<br>success metrics that you've seen and how<br>they kind of get applied to testing so<br>when you have success metrics you try to<br>not make them like a snapshot in time<br>where hey our business goals are so<br>narrow that these are our success<br>metrics and if we're able to accomplish<br>those we've you know got ourselves<br>another six months of business before we<br>have to reset so are our two metrics<br>that we track are streaming which is<br>streaming minutes and retention and<br>they're highly correlated between the<br>two so the more someone watches the more<br>likely they are to be retained as a<br>member and continue to pay for the<br>service so those are our success metrics<br>and they have been a very quite some<br>time but we're constantly kind of<br>challenging the assumption that those<br>are the right things over and over and<br>and developing new metrics actually<br>right now that are that are geared<br>towards understanding a little bit more<br>nuance that again it has to be based in<br>the data that we can actually gather so<br>you could say that our best metric is<br>you know consumer happiness but how we<br>measure that is is really difficult to<br>get a concrete view of that relative to<br>how many minutes somebody actually<br>watched so I think the question is just<br>always challenge the assumptions that<br>were making in our in our metrics but<br>yeah does that answer your question<br>Thanks and with so many tests running at<br>the same time how do you make sure<br>you're getting the right insights out<br>they're not impacting each other and<br>then also along those lines how do you<br>scale so that you can run so many tests<br>at the same time yeah so we basically<br>have flags in our system that determined<br>that hey you can't be in this test and<br>this test they're conflicting but a lot<br>of our tests are algorithms right so<br>we're running different algorithms on<br>the personalization side to make sure<br>we're giving you better content that's<br>more appropriate for kind of your<br>viewing patterns so a lot of the like<br>when I mentioned that everyone in here<br>is in public twenty test half of those<br>if not more our algorithm tests and it's<br>easier to get feedback on those<br>relatively quickly because we'll apply<br>something to you know 10 million people<br>for a little bit of time to better<br>understand it before kind of rolling out<br>whether we go with that algorithm tweak<br>or not so we make sure that we aren't<br>muddying the water so that we can get<br>those clean rains hi I'm I was just<br>wondering why the content we have in New<br>Zealand is different to the ones in<br>states or like other parts of the world<br>yeah so that comes down to licensing<br>there it's it's really kind of an<br>archaic system of how you buy content<br>and distributed around the world so<br>there's like first run right second run<br>rights so when you're trying to find if<br>we want to license a Marvel movie or<br>something like that in the US it's<br>really really expensive to do that in<br>that market it might be easier for us to<br>do that in you know in New Zealand or it<br>might be more difficult so that's why<br>the content catalog is different<br>depending on where you go in the world<br>you know we're creating so many<br>hopefully great shows and movies that<br>people love and they'll be available<br>everywhere Netflix is offered with no<br>limitations and that's really the world<br>that we're trying to get to hi there<br>again<br>oh hi just two questions that I have so<br>the first one is which other company<br>apart from Netflix of course do you<br>think has really great design UI design<br>in UX design<br>that was my first question the second<br>one is how do you keep up with good<br>design is that something that changes<br>throughout ears or is there is that<br>through testing that you keep up with<br>good design yeah so the first question<br>around what other companies kind of I<br>admire from the design perspective I<br>think that Apple would probably be one<br>of them just because of how how kind of<br>clean and focused they are what another<br>would be Airbnb around how they kind of<br>tell stories that you can kind of create<br>these memories through this experience<br>when you're renting a room from a<br>stranger right and I think the the last<br>one would be would be Disney because of<br>the power of storytelling that they've<br>just developed and the brand that they<br>create like they create worlds around<br>their content I think that that's<br>something that's that's kind of really<br>special and how they do that and staying<br>on top of of good design<br>I mean design in some ways is just<br>subjective so what I want to create is I<br>want to create something that's highly<br>usable first and foremost and that's<br>also hopefully provides people with joy<br>at some level but ultimately it's a<br>utility right you could think of us like<br>a digital vending machine right like<br>over down what kind of candy bar do you<br>want what kind of show you want the<br>challenge is how do you kind of innovate<br>on that canvas and how do you develop<br>that to be something that's even more<br>efficient and it allows people to make<br>the right decision for them so I Ari<br>tons of blogs and books and different<br>design things to kind of stay inspired<br>and another one is just listening to<br>other people talk about designs and<br>like kind of their passion and and<br>things that they've tried in the past as<br>well hey firstly great soccer is really<br>awesome thanks for the speaking I've a<br>couple of questions on consistency and<br>design systems so firstly how do you<br>maintain consistency with such a global<br>products in terms of user journeys if<br>someone wants to make a change and<br>across the UI do have separate design<br>systems for different products or is<br>there one unified one so are you ready<br>to gasp we don't have design systems we<br>don't have pattern libraries we don't<br>have any of that stuff you you<br>absolutely need that if you're gonna<br>have a junior team you absolutely need<br>that if you're gonna have a really large<br>team over all of our products we have 51<br>product designers if you compare that to<br>a Facebook or Google who have 400 500<br>600 designers and a lot of we don't hire<br>I don't hire anybody directly out of<br>school I only hire people that have like<br>5 to 7 roughly years of experience so<br>they've cut their teeth somewhere else<br>right they've made those mistakes<br>somewhere else so I don't have to deal<br>with that and I don't have I I have like<br>more I'm hiring people that can make<br>good sound judgment and they tend to be<br>a little bit more mature it with their<br>judgment their logic and their reasoning<br>and so I don't have to create those like<br>hard and fast rules for them I want them<br>to kind of go explore the edges and the<br>fringes and find things that they think<br>are interesting and bring them back so<br>we don't have those systems it you know<br>ask me in a couple years if if the<br>team's doubled in size if we've started<br>to employ those but we don't have them<br>today and then the consistency if you<br>have a spectrum and you have consistency<br>over here you have innovation over here<br>ok like they're at odds with each other<br>and so I'm much more and being<br>inconsistent and innovative than I am<br>about being consistent and not<br>innovative<br>okay I'm really curious to know how you<br>factor in human ethics if at all into<br>the design of your product so if you<br>optimize design then someone's gonna<br>want to keep watching it all over again<br>sort of thing is that considered or do<br>you think that's bad if someone keeps<br>lying to me like so so what somebody who<br>asked me a question earlier today which<br>was around you know don't you feel bad<br>if somebody watches netflix and gains<br>three kilos to which I said plenty of<br>people watch netflix on the treadmill so<br>so my job is not to make decisions for<br>people my job is to help them make<br>decisions for themselves and this might<br>be a little bit of a somber agenda on<br>but my boss grew up homeless and in a<br>very very rough neighborhood<br>and so what video entertainment meant<br>for him was safety he couldn't go<br>outside because it was so dangerous<br>outside so for him it was all about you<br>know watching shows with his friends<br>watching movies with his friends that's<br>not an experience that I had at all I<br>had the exact opposite of that and so I<br>had similar questions when I started<br>Netflix I've liked don't we have ethical<br>and moral responsibility to get people<br>to watch you know better content right<br>like why are we why are we jamming<br>documentaries down people's throats but<br>that's that's not what our job is our<br>job is to tell great stories and<br>distribute them around the world and let<br>people you are members determine whether<br>we create more of those stories by<br>consuming it so I I feel like I have an<br>ethical responsibility tip to at the<br>very least be mindful of any negative<br>kind of outcomes but there's a reason<br>that I work in entertainment and not<br>medical device manufacturing I don't<br>want anybody's death on my head alright<br>thank you all very much really<br>appreciate it<br>thanks for coming here and thanks for a<br>wonderful talk and we knew that Pizza<br>Company where that is cleaning all kinds<br>of video but energy providers read<br>inside that how understanding such a<br>diverse content and consumers it's such<br>a challenge actually and so we have a<br>small gift oh thank you very much<br>everybody's trying to get me drunk to<br>keep me dry I didn't take that drunk<br>awesome thank you guys again and please<br>reach out on Twitter or my email if you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
