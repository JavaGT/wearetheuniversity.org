computing and mobile allowing<br>exponential growth and then the next day<br>the emphasis seems to be on artificial<br>intelligence and robotics putting people<br>out of work but what's really important<br>I think is the speed of change all<br>technologies are advancing at an<br>increasingly rapid rate and it's the<br>speed of change that actually creates<br>the disruption not the technology itself<br>but having said that I think if you<br>think about the list of technologies<br>that we hear about in the media there is<br>a common theme and and that is around<br>digitization so it doesn't really matter<br>whether we're talking about artificial<br>intelligence are we talking about the<br>Internet of Things or we're talking<br>about virtual reality there's a common<br>thread beneath all of those that has to<br>do with digital technologies well unless<br>you're in a purely technology-based<br>business I think business leaders need<br>to be thinking about the changes that<br>the technology is creating in a business<br>environment and not focusing so much<br>just on the technology itself so it's<br>important for most businesses is the<br>kinds of changes in business models<br>business processes manufacturing<br>processes the way we organize work the<br>way we organize businesses rather than<br>the particular technology so if I were a<br>business leader I'd be thinking about<br>things like does the technology change<br>the economies of scale in my sector does<br>it allow me to defragment a sector or<br>alternatively bring a sector together<br>does it allow for disintermediation<br>so those are the kinds of changes in the<br>business contexts that are taking place<br>and for most businesses that's probably<br>more important than the technology<br>itself well of course like anything you<br>see a wide range from those who are<br>adapting very well to those who are kind<br>of ignoring that the problem exists<br>there are lots of surveys on this of<br>course and most of those show<br>that firms are not very well prepared in<br>fact a major study released last year in<br>the New Zealand context showed that only<br>about a third of firms had prepared a<br>digital plan to address potential issues<br>on the other hand about three-quarters<br>of leaders said yeah we know it's a<br>problem and if you really delve into<br>that survey one of the interesting<br>findings that I found was that only 10%<br>of business leaders were actually<br>thinking about how digitization will<br>change the product or the service that<br>they offer and that's really the most<br>fundamental thing that could change I<br>think that leadership in terms of how<br>someone guides an organization through<br>these changes is going to become a key<br>competitive advantage so you can imagine<br>that what's important is that someone<br>have a very clear vision but they'd be<br>very adaptable in how that vision gets<br>implemented because they have to<br>constantly learn and change and be<br>adaptive as the environment around them<br>is changing I think it's also important<br>that the leader not be fazed by change<br>so they'd be very comfortable in an<br>uncertain environment and that they can<br>share that comfort with others in their<br>organization because as we know everyone<br>isn't comfortable with the idea of<br>change so a good leader in the modern<br>environment will be someone who is able<br>to make sense of that environment for<br>the people around them and give them<br>frameworks so that suddenly people have<br>clarity even when everything around them<br>looks like chaos leaders who rely on<br>their position or and their expertise<br>are going to be increasingly challenged<br>because no one is going to be able to<br>stay on top of those kinds of things so<br>what's really important for a leader is<br>to be able to hire the best people and<br>to trust them to move ahead leaders need<br>to be collaborative in in that sense and<br>engaging with not only their employees<br>but with the external environment well<br>first off of course universities like<br>all businesses are being disrupted<br>and to a certain extent universities<br>more so than many other kinds of<br>businesses because much of what we deal<br>with is knowledge which is easily<br>digitized<br>so we're going through all of these<br>challenges ourselves and we're learning<br>by going through that process but<br>equally business schools have a role<br>working alongside businesses to help not<br>only practicing managers deal with these<br>issues but the new younger students who<br>are going to enter a very different<br>future when they enter the work world so<br>on many levels we're dealing with not<br>only existing businesses and learning<br>from those businesses and bringing that<br>into some of the things we do but also<br>sharing some of our thought leadership<br>back to those businesses to help them<br>adapt and change and then together<br>business schools and businesses are<br>working with some of the younger</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
