style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I get a great pleasure of introducing<br>professor Louise Allen's inaugural<br>lecture at the University of Auckland<br>Louise's scholarship is concerned with<br>sexuality and schooling she works in the<br>best tradition of critical studies in<br>education which since the 1970s has been<br>concerned with looking inside the black<br>box of schools and classrooms to<br>understand what is really going on<br>beneath the surface what is it it<br>produces the inequalities the structured<br>divisions and changes our society so it<br>really is a critical study in education<br>and I'm very proud to be able to<br>introduce that as ahead of Krispies my<br>school<br>Louise's career has coincided I won't<br>speak for very long by the way Louise's<br>career has coincided with an indeed<br>contributed in many ways to the<br>proliferation of growing studies which<br>are not aged the diversity of human<br>sexuality and feeling and bodily emotion<br>twenty years ago it would have been<br>impossible to have put a slide with a<br>title called breathing life into<br>sexuality education without that being<br>have some sort of clever metaphor what I<br>know tonight is that we will be informed<br>by a very materialist grounded embodied<br>form of thinking about breathe in life<br>the vitalism which reflects the cultural<br>and the vitalist turns in the social<br>sciences in general so Louisa is ahead<br>of the curve and is part of that sort of<br>growing movement of recognition that<br>life is about breathing living sharing<br>and emoting and all of those things<br>which are so essential and I like to<br>think that one of Rogers wrote adele who<br>was Professor Roger Dale from the<br>University of Bristol and Auckland who<br>was one of one of Louise's mentors would<br>have been very proud of this moment<br>because Roger always used to say if you<br>want to understand understand anything<br>about schooling or education the last<br>place you would look is in schools or in<br>education go outside read widely find<br>out more about what is going on in the<br>world and then come back four or five<br>years later to apply them to these<br>things so it's very tend to be this<br>point to start listing major awards from<br>major grants and it's very not going to<br>do that they are available on Louise's<br>website and you can even learn much more<br>important I think is to recognise the<br>professorial lectures such as this set<br>the scholarly tone and intellectual<br>climate of the university as a whole<br>they are moments where we celebrate the<br>personal project that has brought an<br>individual academic and scholar to the<br>point where they are standing in front<br>of the public and in front of the family<br>who have come all the way from Browns<br>Bay and managed to sneak some wine into<br>the front row as well against statue<br>number twenty eight point two of the<br>university code welcome back to you so<br>it's really important to recognise the<br>personal and academic goals and this is<br>a moment of public recognition so<br>without that I'm going to just stop it<br>gives me great pleasure to introduce<br>professor Louisa to us you know her<br>already and Louise I really hope you<br>enjoy the lecture and this is your night<br>Tanaka Tanaka general Cotto Kotori my a<br>tenday wa mou do de mo dito kia tato<br>come he okie Taku Papa are Bob Ellen<br>Kotaku mama a Lorraine Ellen Kotaku

hapara ha ha ha<br>Louisa Ellen<br>no it's just it's that it was so such a<br>pleasure to be able to do that and I<br>wanted to thank in Dakota for helping me<br>to put that together<br>welcome everybody it is so wonderful to<br>have so many people that I love in the<br>room all at once when you put a<br>professorial application together<br>it is a mammoth undertaking it's about<br>50 pages right and it takes quite a<br>while because it needs to span your<br>entire career and recently I've been on<br>a mentoring program for our faculty and<br>I've had to go back to this application<br>and look at the first 500 words that I<br>wrote in order to give it to the mentees<br>that are on the program and I realized<br>gosh what a lot of people helped me put<br>that application together and what a lot<br>of people have so many people have<br>supported me in my career to date and<br>might be her I thanked my family my<br>father in my mother Lorraine Ellen for<br>always instilling in me a love of<br>knowledge and education and supporting<br>me financially to be able to do to get a<br>degree in in the early years I think<br>also my husband and son Otis who whose<br>love and support really wonderful for me<br>every day I couldn't do this job without<br>them I wanted to thank my friends in the<br>audience here some of whom I have known<br>you're you're precious to me and I also<br>wanted to thank all the teachers all the<br>lecturers and mentors who have seen me<br>to this point really you've been so<br>generous with your knowledge and your<br>time and your kindness and it is so<br>important to thank people I think<br>thinking people is very very needed<br>I told you fifty pages right leave her<br>just the ones that I can remember look<br>for your name I'm sure you'll find it<br>there um I also wanted to say something<br>to the people I know that this is being<br>live-streamed out all across the world<br>and I wanted to say hello to antonia in<br>austria and also live in austria and<br>also my friend Mary Lou in Australia<br>because I know that they're watching<br>tonight so one more thank you to Helen<br>where are you Hellen that's Helen is an<br>amazing person who has organized this<br>event tonight when we had to move the<br>venue she said don't worry it'll be<br>seamless and it was so Thank You Helen<br>okay let's begin so I have entitled this<br>address breathing life into sexuality<br>education the idea of breathing life<br>into education comes from the feminist<br>philosopher Sharon Todd and her keynote<br>address to the philosophy of education<br>Society of Australasia conference which<br>I know that some of you are lucky enough<br>Todd describes breathing life into<br>education as a method for navigating the<br>way certain approaches to education can<br>be stifled she refers to the way<br>education more generally has become<br>preoccupied with foci such as<br>performance so for instance how many<br>schools schools that get the most in<br>ceas<br>there's and the most parses are seeing<br>to be the best kind of schools right so<br>the performance of the school is deemed<br>to be based on the amount of NCEA passes<br>or within universities a sense that the<br>universities were the most aerated PBF<br>researchers are the best universities<br>taught also talks about how education<br>has become preoccupied with managerial<br>standardization and one small example in<br>our in our university is when we had to<br>change our course booklets so that they<br>had standardized wording in them around<br>for instance plagerism and other<br>regulations to do with the students<br>statements about course objectives and<br>requirements and these statements can<br>position students and ways that can be<br>patronizing and antithetical to learning<br>these kind of foci she abused leave most<br>of us gasping for air and longing for<br>spaces to breathe this is because they<br>serve to standardize the experiences of<br>education that stifle creativity in<br>learning and teaching they attempt to<br>regulate the unknown and tame the<br>student and teacher who does not conform<br>to the standard template the delight and<br>of course sometimes discomfort of random<br>unexpected surprises and teaching and<br>learning is squeezed from these<br>experiences leaving us deflated<br>disenchanted and a mobile breathing life<br>into education as Todd conceives it as<br>an approach to education which is life<br>enhancing it is a call to a recognition<br>of our senses and the sensual the<br>embodied act of breathing in and out<br>which is both so taken for granted that<br>we hardly notice it and yet at the same<br>time so fundamental to life and and a<br>sustaining act I would argue that this<br>mundane yet vital act of life is also a<br>form of resistance and to illustrate I<br>want to give you an example from a book<br>that I recently read the book is written<br>by Heather Morris she is a new<br>zealand-born author and she has written<br>the story of lale Sokolov who was a Jew<br>born in Slovakia<br>now that's him pictured here with his<br>wife they<br>himmat an Auschwitz now lolly becomes<br>that that a tourist of Auschwitz<br>Birkenau marking prisoners arms with a<br>four digit number by which they they are<br>to be identified in Kemp and it's a form<br>of dehumanization that lullay cannot<br>understand and absolutely abhors but an<br>act which ultimately enables him to<br>survive for years in a place where very<br>few dead his enforced labor asserted to<br>us leaves him with this terrible guilt<br>the guilt that he lived when so many<br>others did not and there is a moment in<br>the story which highlights for me the<br>vital and resistant nature of breath at<br>the end of the horror of his first day<br>in camp<br>Lali makes a vow to himself and it's<br>written there on on the screen I will<br>live to leave this place I will walk out<br>a free man he vows to keep breathing as<br>a form of resistance to the unimaginable<br>inhumanity he experiences around him in<br>a schvitz breath could not be taken for<br>granted it was easily taken away and its<br>presence in the body of prisoners was a<br>sign of defiance I offer this grave<br>example because it shows so acutely the<br>power of breath the simple act of<br>breathing in and out as some at a<br>symbolic and material level is so much<br>more than a mundane action on a very<br>different human scale I want to suggest<br>that breathing life into sexuality<br>education in ways that attempt to<br>revitalize the older shoes and problems<br>which plague this area of Education is<br>also a form of resistance Todd's idea of<br>breathing life into education has caught<br>my attention for several reasons and<br>it's an especially act metaphor for the<br>sexuality education<br>because sexuality education is often<br>critiqued by students for literally<br>sucking the life out of a subject which<br>has at its core the body and the sensual<br>and this life sucking quality stems from<br>the fact that the the core aim of<br>sexuality education and Western context<br>has been a focus on preventing so-called<br>negative consequences of sexual activity<br>like for instance unplanned pregnancy so<br>this means that instead of sexuality<br>education being life enhancing and the<br>way that Todd conceives of breathing<br>life into education historically<br>sexuality education has been ironically<br>divor devoid of sensual bodies pleasures<br>and desires what I want to do this<br>evening is to trace some of the ways I<br>understand the field of sexuality<br>education leaves us gasping for air and<br>I want to make an argument for the ways<br>in which the field has stagnated around<br>some key issues which we just don't we<br>just can't seem to get past and this<br>isn't just in our Teodoro but also in<br>the field internationally and these<br>issues are not exclusive to sexuality<br>education right they are endemic across<br>schooling in its entire entirety now the<br>first of these issues is homophobia or<br>fear of dislike of homosexual and gay<br>people and the second is how to<br>successfully engage with cultural and<br>religious diversity in student<br>populations and so to do this work I'm<br>going to take you on a journey of some<br>parts of my research which highlight<br>some of these enduring challenges in the<br>field of sexuality education and my aim<br>is to ultimately arrive at the question<br>of how might we reimagine sexuality<br>education now I'm not and this is going<br>to be very disappointing for some of you<br>I'm not going to provide necessarily<br>answers because<br>although I'm going to draw on Sharon<br>Todd's ideas there are no simple answers<br>to these issues there they're very<br>complex and I don't believe that there<br>are single approaches but I want to<br>offer further propositions and<br>provocations which open space for others<br>to join this conversation now when I<br>first started researching in this area<br>in the area of sexuality education I<br>looked at the official curriculum first<br>right I was interested in understanding<br>what kinds of messages sexuality<br>education offered young people about<br>sexuality and their sexual identities<br>and in the course of this research young<br>people told me that although sexuality<br>education was very useful and some bits<br>of it were at least a little bit useful<br>it wasn't the main source of their<br>information that they got at school<br>about sexuality they also got a lot of<br>information from the unofficial<br>curriculum and that is from the kinds of<br>conversations that they might have from<br>peer with peers from interactions<br>between parents and that's their<br>teachers and watching their teachers and<br>other students interact and they found<br>this information extremely useful<br>because it filmed in some of the gaps<br>that they didn't of knowledge that they<br>weren't getting from sexuality education<br>around for instance exactly what sexual<br>activity is because sexuality education<br>hardly ever broaches that how to ask<br>someone out or how to end a relationship<br>so the unofficial curriculum and schools<br>can be likened to what we call in<br>education the hidden curriculum that<br>which is learned but not intentionally<br>taught and these micro moments occur<br>many times every day in schools right<br>and some of the some examples from my<br>own research<br>for instance I've seen this several<br>times when I've been out in schools I'll<br>be out in the playground and one student<br>calls another student affair and a<br>teacher is walking past and that teacher<br>does not intervene in that moment now in<br>that moment a huge amount is learned<br>about sexuality we learn that being<br>called a [ __ ] is not a good thing that it<br>is a denigrated term that<br>heterosexuality is central and that the<br>teacher legitimizes that the teacher<br>believes that that it is ok to allow one<br>student to call another student to fit a<br>[ __ ] in those instances another example<br>of an unofficial learning of about<br>sexuality at school as when schools<br>provide toilets marked male and female<br>but none marked or gender so that gender<br>diverse students have nowhere to relieve<br>themselves or they must risk entering a<br>toilet and which their gender might<br>actually be challenged so it's not an<br>official part of the curriculum but<br>those instances our moments in which<br>learning about sexuality and gender are<br>offered and it was these particular<br>moments that I wanted to explore when I<br>received an early career research<br>excellence award from the University of<br>Auckland thank you especially University<br>of Auckland it was a two-year project<br>and it was looking at the sexual<br>cultures of schooling and because it was<br>the kind of project that meant that was<br>looking at unofficial our learnings<br>about sexuality I couldn't go to the<br>curriculum directly I couldn't go to<br>policy documents I needed to be able to<br>explore this area with a methodology<br>that was quite unconventional so I don't<br>know what possessed me but I decided<br>that photo methods would be a good idea<br>to gain some some data from schools<br>around sexuality and the ethics around<br>this as was really difficult to<br>negotiate I think I was quite green at<br>the time in terms of not realizing how<br>how difficult it would be to give<br>students<br>cameras that they could go into school<br>and take photos of how they learned<br>about sexuality but that's another<br>lecture we won't we won't go there<br>tonight and I've written about it in<br>many places so so I asked the students I<br>couldn't say to them can you please take<br>photos of the unofficial culture of<br>school because I mean what does that<br>mean I don't even know myself I said I<br>said to them can you take take photos of<br>every time you see something sexual at<br>at school because there will be a moment<br>in which are actually learning about<br>sexuality so I gave them the disposable<br>cameras and they took photos across two<br>weeks or one week and then they came<br>back to me we developed the film's and<br>we talked about them and these are some<br>of the photos this photo was one that<br>was shown across several of the photo<br>diaries that the young people put<br>together they were in the last two years<br>of secondary school so they were seventh<br>that's old-school similar form year 12<br>and 13 and they said we learn a lot<br>about sexuality at school from watching<br>couples in relationships we get a sense<br>of what a normal relationship is from<br>seeing other couples interact and so<br>there were lots of photos of opposite<br>gendered couples holding hands<br>another unofficial learning of sexuality<br>mmm-hmm<br>this particular one was taken by a young<br>woman who told me she learned quite a<br>lot from this graffiti on her desk which<br>because she came from a family of four<br>girls and she didn't have any brothers<br>and so I don't know if you can see it<br>particularly clearly but it's someone<br>has etched a penis into the desk and<br>they've written [ __ ] underneath and they<br>and the young woman said well that was<br>quite useful because I knocked<br>semi-erect so I kind of got a sense of<br>what that would look like because<br>sexuality education doesn't offer those<br>kinds of<br>insights under sexuality if you ever<br>another image was this one taken by<br>Danny who said that the boys locker room<br>was a really important space for<br>learning about sexuality in two ways the<br>first way was that it enabled him to<br>compare his own physical development<br>with that of other boys to see if he was<br>normal so he could check out other boys<br>bodies and he was and then he could see<br>whether or not he was developing at the<br>same rate the other way it became useful<br>for learning about sexuality was it was<br>a space that was not well patrolled or<br>policed by teachers because they have a<br>fear of coming into gym locker rooms<br>these days in case students are you know<br>don't have without clothes so they<br>usually just put their heads through the<br>door and they say are you like hurry up<br>which means that students can sit there<br>and talk about whatever they want and so<br>Danny said he learnt a lot in these<br>moments about sexuality about<br>relationships about the sorts of things<br>that people were doing in relationships<br>without that surveillance from teachers<br>this rather grainy picture is a as a<br>result of the fact that the Ethics<br>Committee wanted me to ensure that the<br>identity of participants couldn't be<br>seen in photos so we've got the faces<br>are pixelated here but when I was given<br>this image I thought that sounds got<br>anything to do with sexuality why is<br>this person taken this this this photo<br>the young mean the young man who took it<br>took it because he said I'm really<br>annoyed with the teachers the way they<br>always think that when you're talking to<br>someone of the opposite gender that it's<br>always sexual like why do they always<br>assume that about us that we are<br>constantly thinking about sex and that<br>we can't just talk so this particular<br>image was he named it just talking and<br>fact that young people can just talk the<br>last image also with pixelated faces was<br>taken by a young woman of her two<br>friends who were out lesbians at school<br>she said that they were one of the only<br>lesbian couples in her school and she<br>was good friends with them and she<br>really didn't like the amount of<br>discrimination that they experienced at<br>school in fact at one point they'd been<br>in the our school yard and a group of<br>woman young woman had come over to her<br>friends and started hurling abuse and so<br>she had and tried to intervene stood<br>between these these women and got<br>punched so so the person who took this<br>photo wanted to show that that school is<br>pretty homophobic in lots of ways and<br>that this is one of the things that she<br>has learned from being at school now one<br>of the things that I learnt from this<br>study was the way schools are stifling<br>of student sexuality and the way that<br>they leave them gasping for air largely<br>because schools are heteronormative and<br>that as they Center heterosexuality as<br>seen and that most of the photos taken<br>of couples were of opposite gender<br>couples that they positioned that<br>school's position young people is<br>particular sexual subjects where their<br>sexuality is seen as a risk to<br>themselves and to others that they're<br>always that young people have always<br>seemed to be sexually very voracious<br>they're always thinking about sex they<br>can't just talk to each other without<br>you know having something sexual on<br>their minds I also learned that<br>sexuality is not a life enhancing<br>characteristic of identity at school and<br>it's mainly taboo embarrassing wrong<br>except in certain forms like<br>heterosexuality and other in<br>circumstances like marriage or committed<br>relationships if you compare this this<br>kind of culture of schooling unofficial<br>culture of schooling to the<br>sorts of things that young people<br>themselves know about sexuality that<br>they access from other realms of their<br>lives like digital media the internet<br>social media platforms popular music<br>television film and teen fiction how can<br>we possibly expect sexuality education<br>to reach young people with important<br>messages about c4 sex for instance when<br>it is so divorced from the everyday<br>realities and interests when it doesn't<br>speak to them and in ways that recognize<br>their desire and pleasure for Same Same<br>gendered with the same gendered couples<br>and there's a kind of didactic nature to<br>sexuality education that emphasizes risk<br>and danger and avoids pleasure and<br>desire so that it just kind of feels<br>sexuality education feels like a lecture<br>from an annoyed parent who wants you to<br>do what they want you to do so if we're<br>really committed to supporting our young<br>people to grow into healthy and happy<br>citizens then why don't we address them<br>positively and legitimately as sexual<br>subjects in ways that take account of<br>their real lives and this is an issue<br>around which we have become stuck on<br>sexuality education how do we actually<br>give young people the kind of<br>information that resonates with their<br>actual lives instead of constantly<br>focusing on risk and danger and the<br>things that that are negative about<br>sexuality and not life enhancing so it's<br>a challenge that continues to plague<br>sexuality education in New Zealand and<br>internationally another one of these<br>enduring issues and sexuality education<br>that I want to turn to now and I'm going<br>to go back to this image because it<br>encapsulates that really well is the<br>prevalence of homophobia in schools now<br>for many of us who were<br>in the field of sexuality education and<br>the audience homophobia is a villian<br>there's a villain that just will not die<br>no matter how much effort we put into<br>kind of trying to eradicate it<br>it just keeps popping up however there's<br>this kind of more general perception<br>within public perception I think more<br>that homophobia is declining and this<br>idea is also being advanced in some<br>academic quarters with books written on<br>for instance the declining significance<br>of homophobia that's a title of one of<br>these books in schools by Matt McCormack<br>in the UK now mark McCormack argues that<br>young men no longer rely on homophobia<br>as the main way in which they construct<br>and maintain their masculine identities<br>but in my research I found very little<br>evidence of this declining significance<br>of homophobia what I have found is that<br>what homophobia looks like has changed<br>it's morphed into something that is less<br>discernible than hate or fear of<br>homosexuals and historically homophobia<br>has been understood as an extreme and<br>irrational aversion to homosexuality and<br>homosexual people it may long no longer<br>be acceptable to say outright outrightly<br>homophobic things like being gay is<br>wrong because it's against God right but<br>that does not mean that people are no<br>longer homophobic or less homophobic<br>what homophobia looks like is configured<br>differently in the current moment but<br>I'm yet to be convinced that it is less<br>prevalent I guess I need to have a<br>conversation with McCormack at some time<br>but to illustrate this point I want to<br>provide an example of how homophobia<br>currently presents itself in<br>the research that I have been doing and<br>this comes from a conversation with a<br>young woman named Gabby who is very<br>typical of the young women and young<br>people in my research<br>she comes from a school with a very<br>comprehensive sexuality education<br>program where sexual diversity is<br>actually part of the curriculum I know<br>because I sat in a class while whoo<br>teacher actually talked about there's<br>been gay bisexual issues so I know she<br>got that information and interestingly<br>her health teacher is an out out lesbian<br>herself and Gabby got on really well<br>with her teacher she said that she<br>really liked her teacher and she admired<br>the fact that she was actually out to<br>students and in fact when I interviewed<br>Gabby she said to me that she really<br>disliked the way that some of the other<br>students in the class treated this this<br>our lesbian teacher and she said there<br>were these girls they were like I don't<br>want to change when she the teachers in<br>the locker room anymore and so Gabby<br>says I think that's pure friggin<br>ignorant actually I think that's so rude<br>to be like oh I don't want to get<br>changed now in case she hits on me like<br>what the hell who do you think you are<br>that makes me so angry so you can see<br>that she had she is aware of<br>discrimination and she's not happy about<br>this treatment with her teacher of her<br>teacher yet while Gabby sees this<br>treatment of a teacher is unjust<br>she also says the following a little<br>later in the interview and we're<br>actually talking about the fact that<br>there are not many Gabby says there<br>aren't many out gay or lesbian students<br>at her school and I'm so and I said to<br>her well why do you think that is what<br>why do you think that the young people<br>aren't out who again is being at your<br>school and her response goes like this<br>this just proves it's not always very<br>accepted and I think that even though<br>people are sort of like it's okay to be<br>gay it's awesome you know whatever<br>really it's not because it's kind of<br>strange<br>I mean it's fine my mom is really really<br>judgmental that makes me real angry but<br>I have nothing to say to anyone that's<br>gay<br>none of my business I'm like that's<br>great I hope you guys have a loving<br>relationship as long as you're happy<br>that's frigging awesome she liked the<br>word frigging I have nothing at all to<br>say about even though I'm Christian and<br>obviously it's wrong and my religion to<br>do that but I'm not the judge of that<br>I'm not going to be like that's wrong<br>it's nothing to do with me so yeah<br>that's my opinion on same-sex couples<br>what I find interesting here is that<br>Gabby likes her teacher and she's<br>willing to defend her against homophobic<br>comments from other students at the same<br>time as she believes that being gay is<br>kind of strange<br>while liking her teacher and admiring<br>her top gay identity<br>she also distances herself from who get<br>from gayness by saying I have nothing to<br>say to anyone that's gay it's known to<br>my business she also casts gay as being<br>morally wrong when she says I'm<br>Christian and obviously it's wrong in my<br>religion she simultaneously insists I'm<br>not the judge of that I'm not gonna be<br>like that's wrong it's nothing to do<br>with me all the while these sentiments<br>are wrapped up in good wishes I hope you<br>guys have a loving relationship as long<br>as you're happy this is not a homophobia<br>based on hate and ignorance gabby is<br>knowledgeable about sexual diversity<br>from her house class and her out lesbian<br>teacher whom she genuinely likes and<br>believes should not have to endure<br>homophobic discrimination yet<br>simultaneously her words cast<br>homosexuality as wrong strange not<br>accepted and against my religion if we<br>try going to try to reduce homophobia in<br>schooling we need to recognize<br>that Homer homophobia does not always<br>look like we expect it to that it's not<br>always based on hate and ignorance and<br>these characteristics not only make it<br>harder to identify but much more<br>challenging to address I want to turn<br>now to the issue of cultural and<br>religious difference in sexuality<br>education and I've been very lucky to be<br>part of a international research<br>collaboration that received funding from<br>the Australian Research Council that was<br>looking at how might we engage with<br>cultural and religious diversity in<br>sexuality education and that project was<br>headed by Mary Lewis mucin in Australia<br>so my role was to hit the auckland-based<br>element of this research and it meant<br>spending time and schools or one<br>particular school and looking at the<br>sexuality education curriculum as it was<br>taught I had an iPad in the class and we<br>actually recorded the lesson and we I<br>interviewed the teacher and in some of<br>the students the students were in year<br>10 and there they were aged 13 and 14<br>years old and we chosen a class that had<br>high Maori and Pacifica numbers of<br>students in the class and in fact it was<br>mainly Mahdi and Pacifica students<br>because we on our research team we had a<br>maori researcher and we thought that we<br>were going in to look at a difference in<br>learned such a lot about cultural<br>religious difference from this<br>particular study the first thing I<br>learned was the difference that I<br>thought that I was coming to observe was<br>actually not the difference I ended up<br>noticing and this is because when the<br>class is full of Marty and Pacifica<br>students the locus of different shifts<br>Marty and Pacific<br>become the norm and then everybody else<br>is different and this included me who<br>was parking ah and one of the only<br>Pacquiao Palani people in the class<br>including the teacher and one other<br>student and then there was one other<br>student who was different in the hip the<br>class and I caught I called her Carol<br>and I was really drawn to her from the<br>first day of observation in their class<br>and I was drawn to her difference<br>because in a classroom full of Maori and<br>Pacific her face pacifica faces who<br>stood out as because I'm not touching<br>the screen enough Carol was the only one<br>wearing a hijab can you still hear me<br>Carol was the only one wearing a hijab<br>Carol's family where were refugees from<br>Africa and she was Muslim I later<br>learned when I interviewed her she was<br>also different in terms of her<br>interactions in the class so she always<br>said at the front of the class right in<br>front of the male teacher whereas all<br>the other girls in the class clumped<br>themselves in the middle and they were<br>in French friendship groups she was also<br>one of the only young women in the class<br>to constantly ask questions and and so<br>this made her stand out as well when I<br>interviewed Carol I followed a<br>predetermined set of a predetermined<br>script of Christians that our research<br>team had devised to explore cultural and<br>religious diversity in the sexuality<br>education classroom and one of these one<br>of these Christians went as follows<br>so I say cut sexuality education offer<br>any other things about your culture or<br>religion that you wanted to know more<br>about or have recognized or mentioned<br>and Carol says well I mean that's a hard<br>thing to say because New Zealand isn't<br>as lama country it seems very Christian<br>based or something based and our school<br>is mainstream it's not really<br>faith-based because even a thing<br>meaning the teachers did mention it or<br>they say it out of context that's just<br>going to give misunderstandings imagine<br>if there wasn't actually a Muslim<br>teaching it who knew the same thing and<br>they said something else it would just<br>be like difficult so you can see that<br>earnest attempt of our research team the<br>the question of our research team to<br>kind of do the right thing to<br>acknowledge Carol's difference and to be<br>inclusive and welcome welcoming of its<br>appearance in sexuality education but<br>Carol's response was not was not what<br>the research team had been expected<br>instead of saying yeah that's a great<br>idea I'd like more of my own culture and<br>religion acknowledged and included in<br>the curriculum she expresses reluctance<br>about such an inclusion and while not<br>outright ly refusing that the idea she's<br>going to be a diplomat this this young<br>woman she rather politely says that's a<br>hard thing to say it would be just like<br>difficult Carol doesn't want her own<br>religious views included in the<br>curriculum she fears that a non-muslim<br>school would get it all wrong she<br>worries about being misrepresented she<br>worries that there's no teachers<br>suitable to undertake this work who know<br>the right things to say about being<br>Muslim she doesn't want to be an add-on<br>to the curriculum<br>she doesn't even necessarily want to<br>share her religion with the class what<br>would be the point to let others know<br>and possibly ridicule her own worldview<br>she told me that she got all of the info<br>that she needed about sexuality outside<br>of school from her local mosque what<br>more could she learn from its inclusion<br>and sexuality education class at her<br>school<br>Carol taught me much about approaching<br>different<br>when I entered that classroom and saw<br>carolers different I did so in a way<br>that many of our current educational<br>practices and policies and education do<br>I recognized her difference in terms of<br>a set of attributes or characteristics<br>of differences I wasn't seeing Carol for<br>who she she was I was seeing Carol for<br>what she was that is a set of<br>characteristics that made her different<br>from the other students in the class she<br>was the only one wearing a hijab her<br>facial features were African and not<br>Maori or from the Pacific she was a she<br>was a girl who asked questions when the<br>other girls didn't she was a Muslim girl<br>who asked Christians when in my<br>Eurocentric has some my Eurocentric<br>assumption was that Muslim girls do not<br>ask Christians about sexuality in this<br>rendition of difference as Todd explains<br>diversity is shorthand for naming<br>precisely those differences that need to<br>be managed since they create the<br>conditions for conflicts to a conflict<br>to arise<br>that's what under grid such<br>articulations of cultural diversity is<br>the assumption that diversity is a<br>problem a source of social tension that<br>needs to be remedied in our project<br>we've been understand understanding<br>diversity as a problem to be solved our<br>questions position Carol as a problem<br>that needed to be remedied in the<br>classroom careless Muslim how do we<br>cater to her the problem with this<br>orientation difference is that it<br>reduces Carol to a set of<br>characteristics that she was not she was<br>not a quiet Muslim girl she was not a<br>student who wanted her differences<br>catered for in the sexuality education<br>classroom our approach to Carol's<br>difference rendered her an individual<br>who becomes a generalized figure read<br>through her attributes and I'm referring<br>to Todd the<br>now in this last part of the lecture I<br>want to turn back to Todd to ask how can<br>we engage with these issues of cultural<br>and religious difference in homophobia<br>in ways that breathe life into education<br>when I read Carroll as a set of<br>generalized characteristics as a head<br>job wearing choir Muslim girl what I<br>lose is her uniqueness for Todd<br>uniqueness is what appears when human<br>beings come into relation with each<br>other it's a moment where what we are<br>not who we are is made and what this<br>approach misses is that each encounter<br>each coming into relation is itself<br>unique it might look the same or feel<br>the same but each encounter is in fact<br>new and we can liken this to the way<br>that Todd explains breathing and I'm<br>quoting Todd here to breathe us to<br>undergo a unique encounter with the<br>world each and every time after all no<br>breath is ever repeated twice each<br>breath is different from the next and<br>occurs only in the here and now of<br>living experience and one of the things<br>that I find most exciting about this<br>notion of encountering others is the<br>potential that it holds for change if<br>each encounter with others is new<br>then each encounter is an opportunity<br>for for things to be different and the<br>here and now but not in the usual ways<br>we understand change to occur from<br>newness because the potential for change<br>does not rest solely on the encounter<br>being new it involves an orientation to<br>this encounter which we need to<br>cultivate in ourselves it involves a<br>concern with attention an openness to<br>uncertainty which Todd argues might be<br>the foundation for how we approach<br>education as a practice more generally<br>she says my view is that education<br>unfolds as a process of both attention<br>openness transition T that as attention<br>as poor if we already presume to know<br>what it is we will here an openness is<br>meaningless without direction towards<br>something to which one is open so in<br>relation to cultural to issues of<br>cultural and religious diversity and<br>sexuality sexuality education what this<br>means is approaching teaching research<br>and research in these classrooms with an<br>openness to uncertainty it means not<br>assuming what differences in those<br>classrooms before entering them but<br>letting difference unfold and the<br>process of encounters with students and<br>this requires a certain openness to<br>uncertainty and a kind of humility where<br>sexuality educators and researchers do<br>not teach us do not presume to know the<br>difference of the other and the invert<br>in advance of the encounter with them it<br>involves and this is difficult for us as<br>teachers our tolerance for not knowing<br>and a suspension of our own judgment<br>about what we know and what we think is<br>right and in relation to issues of<br>homophobia a similar inter openness to<br>uncertainty is sought it means not<br>assuming that homophobia looks and<br>sounds a certain way that homophobia for<br>instance finds expression only when it<br>is based on hate and fear of homosexuals<br>Todd invites us to give attention to<br>homophobia and this is real attention<br>not a superficial survey of select words<br>and actions of students and involves a<br>detailed careful attention to how the<br>experience of homophobia manifests in<br>real life it is a listening under<br>watching an awareness of our own<br>defensive nurse<br>which might find expression as the<br>assertion that homophobia is declining<br>significance and schools so is it<br>possible to change things is it possible<br>that one day we might have a world in<br>which homophobia racism and religious<br>intolerance and discrimination are a<br>distant memory change may not look like<br>we expect it to and this is for the new<br>materialists out there change is a<br>perpetual potentiality and already<br>becoming change is like breath<br>it is mundane and profound at the same<br>time as Todd says with each physical<br>inhalation and exhalation of air flowing<br>through the body<br>Britta's both at once singular and<br>relational it is a single body that<br>breathes in and yet the act of breathing<br>is relational through the air that we<br>share with others so too is change<br>around homophobia and racism and<br>religious and tolerance this change is a<br>singular act and a collective<br>life-sustaining responsibility and I'd<br>like to finish with a dedication and I<br>know that you're supposed to do<br>dedications at the beginning but you'll<br>know that you'll probably notice that<br>I'm not much of a conformist I'd like to<br>dedicate this lecture to my previous<br>teachers who propelled me on this right<br>to my family and my friends who embraced<br>me in the now and to my students past<br>and present who are the future of the<br>field here now go toe in their coat are<br>in the manner in RL in a hi-fi tena<br>koutou tena koe tena koe take our tour<br>for those of you don't know me my name's<br>mark arrow I'm the Dean of the Faculty<br>of Education and social work and it<br>falls to me to thank you all for your<br>attendance here tonight it's great to<br>see so many of Louise's family members<br>friends students and colleagues in the<br>audience thank you Louisa in particular<br>for your excellent address promotion to<br>Professor as the highest academic an<br>actual accolade that enacted the<br>University campus bestow on an academic<br>staff member as louisa noted at the<br>beginning to promote an academic to the<br>rank of Professor the university enacts<br>a rigorous review of her work to be<br>assured of the excellence of your<br>teaching who research in his service the<br>process of professor allen's promotion<br>ended here tonight with us inaugural<br>address inaugurations of professors or<br>masters and the rituals associated with<br>them are traditions that stretch back to<br>the very beginnings of the medieval<br>University almost all the rituals<br>involved the new professors paying for<br>large doses of hospitality for hers and<br>I used the pronoun advisor Lee new<br>colleagues in some cases with feasting<br>extending for several days or weeks<br>somewhere along the way the requirement<br>for the new professor to provide food<br>and drink for the university staff has<br>been lost something for which I'm sure<br>Louise was very grateful<br>however the ritual that has survived as<br>the inaugural lecture<br>thus this evening we have all<br>participated in an event with a very<br>long history in association with the<br>Western University I'm sure you will all<br>agree that with me that tonight Louisa<br>in her inaugural address has paid her<br>role well in preserving the tradition of<br>the inaugural lecture that she has<br>provided us with ample evidence who were<br>academic prowess and of her worthiness<br>to be accorded the rank of provost<br>professor I ask you all to join me once<br>more graduating professor Ellen on who<br>elevations of the rank of professor</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
