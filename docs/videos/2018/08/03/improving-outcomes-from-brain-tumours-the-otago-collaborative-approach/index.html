Tanya<br>Slater tanya is a senior research fellow<br>and it Charles hookahs fellow in the<br>Department of Pathology and she's<br>involved in molecular pathology in<br>looking it in particular outcomes for<br>cancer and tonight she's going to be<br>talking on who work that she's done<br>around brain cancer so glioblastoma and<br>others and looking to see um what we can<br>see from a molecular point of view um in<br>terms of developing therapies for the<br>disease thank you very much action and<br>thank you for the invitation to speak<br>tonight someone saw what the work that<br>I've been involved in in looking at I'm<br>trying to improve the outcome for brain<br>tumors and their local work is done here<br>the Tago but we also include other<br>centers in New Zealand as well so the<br>this slide might be self explanatory so<br>brain what I work on is brain tumors so<br>tumors that are in the brain but for<br>some of you will be aware of this and<br>some of you won't that brain tumors can<br>arise from cells that are within the<br>brain themselves so we call those<br>primary brain tumors and they could be<br>malignant or they could be benign and<br>then we have another group of tumors<br>that are aggressive tumors that start<br>elsewhere and move to the brain so these<br>are metastatic tumors and they're more<br>common in the population and the the<br>problem with brain tumors as many of you<br>can imagine it's a it's a very<br>specialized organ so a lot of symptoms<br>that patients will develop are those<br>that would affect the functioning of the<br>brain so often patients will present<br>with things such as issues with sight or<br>hearing or another major one is<br>personality issues as well which you<br>wouldn't see with other types of tumors<br>the other part is we have this<br>nomenclature for how we how we named<br>brain tumors there's over 120 different<br>types of primary brain tumors and they<br>have this specific nomenclature so some<br>of these terminologies can be quite<br>confusing and so the base the primary<br>brain tumors are named after the cell of<br>which they're thought to start from so<br>if you think about it and we've got<br>tumors that are in their meninges which<br>are the coverings of the brains most<br>tumors are called the Minji oma and the<br>one we'll talk about today is in the the<br>main part of brain itself and these are<br>gliomas or cells that arise from glial<br>cells or glial cells in the cells that<br>support the neurons in the brain and the<br>tumor type I talk about most ischemic or<br>glioblastoma so it's a type of glial<br>tumor it's a very aggressive tumor and<br>it has other than other terminologies<br>that people might be aware of as well so<br>glioblastoma multiforme or GBM or<br>grade-four astrocytoma so it's a very<br>aggressive tumor it is so you might<br>these incidences of brain tumors answers<br>hives it's about 226 each year in New<br>Zealand for the mortality associated<br>them with them is very very high so it's<br>a second leading cause of death for men<br>aged twenty to forty four and it's also<br>associated with a very poor overall<br>prognosis<br>so the overall prognosis we look at the<br>median survival which is only fourteen<br>point six months and also the two-year<br>survival which is about 24 to survival<br>is at 24 percent of patients so this is<br>very low when you compare it to things<br>like breast cancer or prostate cancer we<br>tend to refer to as 10-year survival so<br>you can see that's a very aggressive<br>tumor type the the unlike other types of<br>tumors that you might be aware of often<br>these really strong risk factors so<br>things like UV light for melanoma or<br>smoking for lung cancer but with the<br>glioblastomas we really don't have any<br>strong risk factors we can't identify<br>who is at might most at risk for these<br>type of tumors so it's a very difficult<br>tumor to try to identify who is at most<br>risk<br>how we treat these tumors Oh vomit ah<br>here's the neurosurgeon here see he will<br>take that tumor out and tries very best<br>to get as much of the tumor as possible<br>and then we have radiotherapy that we<br>use after that there's some more couple<br>the residual tumor because these are<br>very invasive tumors so the surgery is<br>how's a mitosis remove the tumor there's<br>going to be some Razoo residual tumor<br>present and then we after radiotherapy<br>we treat with chemotherapy and that drug<br>is called tumors Olamide so the brand<br>name here is on the right hand side Tim<br>doll so it's it was approved by the FDA<br>in 1999 and we it's following a protocol<br>called the stop protocol and I'll talk a<br>little bit about that latest that was<br>the evidence-based medicine that that<br>team Missoula mode would work for<br>patients with glioblastoma and that what<br>we do in New Zealand is you get given<br>tea Missoula made concurrently so at the<br>same time you're receiving radiotherapy<br>and you get it afterwards as well so tea<br>masala mites as some people will be<br>aware of the difficulties and getting<br>PHARMAC to approve drugs that work Tim<br>as Olamide so you remember that stuff<br>protocol where they showed that Tim as<br>Olamide worked really well which came in<br>pretty quickly relative to other drugs<br>in New Zealand a 2005 study was<br>published by 2006 PHARMAC funded tea<br>masala mode for glioblastoma patients in<br>New Zealand but there were problems so<br>some individuals if you had a grade 3<br>tumor so you're going to it's going to<br>progressed a great for you were alert<br>you were not given an Tim as Olamide and<br>in 2010 farm that changed that decision<br>so this is the dr. moody here is the<br>medical director of far McCandless's his<br>response saying that aggressive brain<br>tumors are difficult to treat we know<br>that Tim as Olamide works and therefore<br>this was the decision that they were<br>going to include grade 3 patients into<br>allowing them to have tumors Olamide and<br>again as if as far mek probably say with<br>mini drug saying well yes these drugs<br>work but they're expensive and PHARMAC<br>have to try their best<br>to make sure that they fund things that<br>based on evidence-based medicine the<br>next decision was in 2016 because it was<br>still issues with the funding of tumors<br>Olamide so if you were a patient and you<br>were living for two years with<br>glioblastoma so temozolomide is probably<br>working for you you were not eligible to<br>anymore once you've finished your six<br>adjuvant cycles that was it and that was<br>seemed a very unfair because we should<br>be in a position with drugs are working<br>for patients that they're able to<br>continue on those drugs so in 2016<br>PHARMAC decided that if you showed<br>evidence that teamers Olamide was<br>working for you you were eligible for<br>more tea masala might so that's to show<br>that that was done as well and this is<br>the evidence here of why we use teams<br>Olamide so in this case here this is the<br>stop protocol published in the New<br>England Journal of Medicine where we all<br>want to eventually get a paper in and it<br>was in 2005 and it shows that and if you<br>look at the red line these are patients<br>this is patient survival and it's<br>showing that they survive they survive<br>for a shorter period of time if they're<br>just given surgery and radiotherapy<br>compared to patients that were also had<br>tumors Olamide so this is the evidence<br>that team Missoula made improved the<br>median survival so that's where 50% of<br>the patients are surviving so originally<br>that's why it's now fourteen point six<br>months and longer-term survival so that<br>patients that are surviving if you take<br>two year mark we've got more people<br>surviving at two years about 20% to what<br>we had before tumors Alameda was<br>available so T Missoula modes improving<br>their overall prognosis for most 50% of<br>patients and also improving the longer<br>term survival for a group of patients so<br>the previous with Tim as all of my bets<br>there's drugs that target the tumor the<br>tumor cells the cancerous cells but we<br>have another issue and trying to target<br>tumors effectively is that tumors have<br>other cells that are present so it's not<br>just that the cancerous cells or the<br>malignant cells a tumor contains many<br>other cell types so these can be<br>in sales and these immune cells can<br>contribute so that tumor being more<br>aggressive and you can also have other<br>cells such as endothelial cells that<br>produce new blood vessels so that's a<br>problem because those brain tumors will<br>eventually run out of nutrients and<br>those new blood vessels will deliver<br>more nutrients to those tumors so if you<br>want effective treatments for people<br>it's not only a case of targeting their<br>malignant cells we also need to target<br>these other cells that promote this<br>tumor microenvironment and some people<br>might be aware of these these are<br>particularly big drugs came in for<br>treating patients with melanoma so we<br>have checkpoints in tumors so<br>checkpoints are where the immune systems<br>the immune system is kind of two<br>different two different arms I guess you<br>could see there's evil or not so the<br>immune system is very good at getting<br>rid of tumors the immune system can say<br>it can target things that it considers<br>to be abnormal such as tumors and that's<br>a function of the T cell but<br>unfortunately the immune cells also have<br>a function in which case they can stop<br>that T cell from being effective so it<br>can stop those T cells from killing your<br>tumor cells and they do this through<br>checkpoints so one cheek point is a<br>protein called PDL one so you can have<br>PDL one on your tumor cell or another<br>cell in that tumor micro-environment and<br>it inhibits by binding to something<br>called PD one on your T cell so that<br>combination of those two molecular<br>markers will stop that T cells stop the<br>immune system from being able to target<br>your tumor and we have other ones as<br>well so it's not only the PDL one is<br>something could see if one R so see if<br>one hours in another immune cell that's<br>present in those tumors that stops your<br>immune response from mate being able to<br>target the tumor cell so again what we<br>want to do is in the new therapies that<br>are coming out and not just targeting<br>your malignant cells they're also<br>targeting that immune suppressive tumor<br>microenvironment and this is just to<br>give you an indication there's many many<br>different drug trials at the moment<br>there are tagged using these immune<br>checkpoints<br>patients with glioblastoma but there's a<br>particular problem for that and that is<br>that we at the moment how we design drug<br>trials we target all patients regardless<br>of what your outcomes going to be<br>you get that everybody gets the drug<br>target and you can see in this slide<br>here this is outcome from patients and<br>Hamilton in Dunedin that if this is post<br>t Mozilla made arrow the outcome is very<br>very different for individual people -<br>some individuals are surviving a very<br>long period of time 40 months and others<br>are having a very very short survival<br>time post diagnosis so this is a problem<br>so the outcome for this type of tumor is<br>very very heterogeneous it's different<br>for different individuals and the reason<br>for this is that the tumors are not the<br>same we call them glioblastoma but<br>there's lots of differences within those<br>tumors and between individuals<br>so the key thing now is we need to<br>identify what those differences are why<br>does one person get a really good<br>response to be a treatment but another<br>person does not and target the<br>individuals or people with all our tumor<br>subgroups much much better so we can<br>improve the outcome for all with<br>glioblastoma not just a subset of<br>patients and the reason why those tumors<br>are different is because they have<br>different genetic changes so in your<br>tumor some people might have one genetic<br>change another group will have a<br>different genetic change and that will<br>that will affect the response to<br>treatment and so genetic changes affect<br>the way cells grow they affect the way<br>cells die they also affects the way<br>cells will respond to treatment and they<br>will fit the way that that they can<br>evade detection by the immune system and<br>destruction by the immune system so for<br>example in my previous cases your tumor<br>might have PDL one so you're not going<br>to risk you're going to have an<br>environment that's more likely to<br>suppress the T cells from working versus<br>a patient who doesn't have PDL one and<br>again these genetic changes contribute<br>to lots of different things with the<br>immune system they could<br>lots of different things to treat the<br>tumor they contribute to the development<br>of the tumor the progression of the<br>tumor and the resistance to treatment so<br>this is a slide of how we how we work<br>and Otago what we do is we have a system<br>where we start with understanding what's<br>important for patients that have<br>glioblastoma so this is where we get<br>patient samples from surgery and we look<br>at in those patient samples what are the<br>key genetic changes that are in those<br>tumors that will predict prognosis or<br>treatment response you know in our<br>patients we then move to more lab based<br>things that's their cell culture hood is<br>very well organized - cell culturing<br>conditions here and then and so what we<br>want to show is although we found<br>something important in a tumor does that<br>really cause the things that we think it<br>does so what we want to do in that case<br>here we can engineer cells to produce a<br>think we the thing we think is very<br>important and prove that it actually<br>does promote tumor growth and so it's<br>kind of that it is not just associated<br>in tumor for some other factor it is<br>actually causing that resistance to<br>treatment and the last part is that<br>women can use animal models so these are<br>key once we find something in patients<br>that's important we then translate that<br>in vitro to show yes it does - what we<br>think it will do that animal models can<br>actually prove that yes the thing that<br>you thought was promotion that tumor<br>actually does and just and I'll talk<br>about some of the work that we've been<br>doing in relation to glioblastoma<br>so this glioblastoma has this key<br>genetic changes so some patients will<br>have some mutations and these are called<br>for these long names of just given the<br>shortened version here such as idh1<br>mutations some patients will have p53<br>mutations and some will have different<br>means by which cells become immortal so<br>these are things at the end of the<br>chromosomes that make those cells able<br>to continue dividing or continue<br>surviving and these different mechanisms<br>for that so one is we call it alt and<br>one we called telomerase positive so<br>different patients will use different<br>mechanisms another a marker and<br>glioblastoma is a genetic marker called<br>MGMT so MGMT is key so some patients<br>will have MGMT in their tumor and some<br>will not if you have MGMT you're you're<br>able to detoxify temozolomide so<br>temozolomide will damage with the DNA of<br>your tumor cells and cause those tumor<br>cells to die<br>but unfortunately if you have MGMT MGMT<br>takes off that DNA damage so your cells<br>are able to continue surviving so it's<br>it's a marker that means that you're<br>going likely to be resistant to tea<br>masala might another marker that we've<br>been heavily involved in as some<br>patients have tumors with lots of the<br>those cells that promote a tumor and the<br>tumor microenvironment called<br>macrophages so some tumors some patients<br>will have on the left hand side they<br>have a very low content of macrophages<br>and others have a very very high content<br>so you can see the image on the right<br>hand side has a lot of these these<br>macrophages in this particular patients<br>tumor so it's very different to another<br>patient and what we've been doing is and<br>I showed you that slide before where I<br>tried to illustrate that GBM is very<br>heterogeneous patients survive for very<br>different periods of time but what we've<br>got here is if we're able to use our<br>molecular markers we can start start<br>Sbisa stratify patients<br>so when pink at the top we have a tumor<br>that uses one cell immortalization<br>pathway it does it has idh1 and p53<br>mutations and these individuals have a<br>better prognosis computer some of the<br>other tumor subgroups the group in green<br>in the middle this is an intermediate<br>prognosis of these patients use a<br>different cell immortalization pathway<br>could telomerase they have a low content<br>of those tumor associated macrophages<br>they don't have idh1 or p53 mutations<br>and the group and blue at the bottom<br>these tumors are very similar and some<br>respects to the group that's in green<br>but they have a high content of tumor<br>associative macrophages so they have a<br>much poorer prognosis and the other key<br>thing is we can then look at data the<br>previous data I showed you was after tea<br>masala made was made available in New<br>Zealand and we can compare how things<br>have changed now that team Missoula made<br>is present and so that's the tumors<br>group on the right hand side so what<br>we've been able to show that in that<br>group where we had the where they had<br>the better prognosis before they had a<br>better prognosis the fort in Missoula<br>made was made available the group and<br>Green is key when it comes to<br>understanding why some patients survive<br>a lot better with tumors Allah made this<br>group that is the group that's<br>responding to tea masala mind<br>so before tea masala made was made<br>available New Zealanders overall your<br>50% of patients would live nine months<br>and zero percent of individuals would<br>live out to two years now that tea<br>masala made is made available<br>we we've improved that by 18 months<br>which is a long time for patients with<br>glioblastoma and 20% live more than two<br>years so if we look back at the previous<br>stuff protocol where they also found 20<br>percent of patients living out two years<br>with tea masala mode were able to show<br>this is a subset of glioblastoma<br>patients they have a particular genetic<br>changes in their tumors and they're the<br>ones that are getting the benefit from<br>tea masala might the group learn they<br>had basically poor prognosis now they<br>had poor prognosis before so they're not<br>getting the same benefits of them tea<br>masala made there the group in green are<br>getting so what we really aim to do with<br>our research is improve the prognosis<br>for everybody though particularly what<br>I'll talk about now is how we're working<br>on that group in blue the ones that have<br>a very poor survival that was very<br>similar to the group in green before tea<br>masala mode was made available so maybe<br>we could find a drug that would target<br>this group and this is just so what<br>that's what we're trying to say so is<br>there a molecular difference in these<br>tumors so can we find the reason why<br>Touma's a resistance to mozilla mine and<br>why these individuals have a poor<br>prognosis so here we come to p53 so<br>Antony break rates here and I started<br>working on p53 so p53 is for many of us<br>it's very familiar and other people<br>wouldn't have heard of p53 so p53 is a<br>as a gene and it's its normal role is to<br>make sure that the cell the genome stays<br>intact so when you have a cell that gets<br>targeted by damaged p53 rollers to stop<br>that cell from continuing so those that<br>genetic change is not transferred on on<br>so there those cells stop proliferating<br>will they die the problem that happens<br>in cancers is that you mutate your p53<br>so you have mutant p53 so your cells<br>when damage occurs they start to get<br>unit changes you don't stop those cells<br>from dividing and you don't kill those<br>cells so those cells will continue on to<br>develop tumors and that is the reason<br>why many human tumors have p53 mutations<br>unfortunately that doesn't explain<br>explain our our group that has a poor<br>prognosis they don't have p53 mutations<br>but recent work has shown that p53<br>mutations don't explain everything about<br>why affecting the p53 function causes<br>tumor these things that are very very<br>similar to p53 mutations they are called<br>p53 isoforms and they also promote tumor<br>development so they're very similar to<br>p53 mutations and what they are is they<br>are missing the first part of p53 so<br>they have an in terminal deletion and<br>they have subsequent changes at the<br>c-terminus of p53 that leads to very<br>different isoforms it's all focus a bit<br>more in the later part of talk on the<br>data one through three p53 isoforms so<br>again the key thing to remember is like<br>mutant p53 this is a different form of<br>p53 that's just a very emerging field<br>and it they also promote human<br>development so this is work that we've<br>done and it gave us the evidence that<br>this could be key if we look at<br>glioblastoma<br>patients<br>and we see we've got some that have<br>mutant p53 but in a group that didn't<br>have p53 mutations they had high levels<br>of these p53 isoforms so that led us to<br>believe this could be key here because<br>if you imagine tumors as they promote<br>they need to have mechanisms that are<br>gonna allow them to survive and you can<br>do that by mutant p53 but you could also<br>do that by increasing these p53 isoforms<br>and that's what we've gone on to show in<br>the slide that's on the right-hand side<br>so if you have p53 isoforms there<br>increased in our group that has the poor<br>prognosis that's what we would expect if<br>we're trying to say that maybe these<br>isoforms associated with more aggressive<br>tumors so we've got evidence using human<br>to human patients that that would be the<br>case we've gone on to show that that is<br>the case if we want to show that a that<br>this market is causing a poor prognosis<br>and patients we need to show that this<br>markers in the tumor cells and that's<br>what we've done here from a bottom panel<br>you see some black arrows s pointing out<br>where that p53 isoforms in the malignant<br>cells and a glioblastoma so that's what<br>we would we want to have that evidence<br>suggest we've found something that's a<br>Kristin tumors but it's actually<br>something that's found in those<br>malignant cells so that's consistent<br>with those cells being able to cause<br>problems such as preventing those cells<br>from dying and preventing those cells<br>from responding to tumors Olamide and<br>the other piece of information that<br>we've found is that p53 isoforms become<br>increased in tumors they have where the<br>hypoxia is developing so hypoxia in a<br>tumor is where you're running out of the<br>blood supply and usually that would<br>signal mini cells to die but tumors<br>developed mechanisms to survive in those<br>conditions and that's what's happened<br>here so we're finding that this isuh<br>form is increased in the malignant cells<br>and glioblastoma we also<br>in these tumors they have a high content<br>of p53 isoforms they have high content<br>of those things that affect the immune<br>checkpoints so high levels of CSF when<br>are and high levels of PDL one so this<br>is adding to the fact that these tumors<br>would have would it be preventing the<br>immune system from targeting those<br>tumors but it also means that maybe that<br>these tumors could be targeted with<br>these new checkpoint inhibitors so these<br>drugs that are preventing that are<br>inhibiting PDL 1 or inhibiting C is that<br>if when our might work for these<br>specific patients so the next part took<br>we found this information and patient<br>tumors we've found a reason why that<br>group has a poor prognosis why they may<br>be having that poor prognosis because<br>they have an increase in p53 isoforms so<br>now we've actually done some work to<br>actually prove that that may be the case<br>using the cell in vitro techniques so<br>Mirena and she's hammering has spent a<br>lot of time engineering cells too so<br>we've got some cells that are that have<br>the p53 isoforms engineered in them so<br>we're able to look at if you just change<br>one thing in those cells would we get a<br>would we predict that those cells would<br>would form a worse tumor and that is<br>what we predict as the case so if we<br>engineered these cells and we only have<br>the p53 isoforms change we get increased<br>PDL one so that's consistent with the<br>eisah form leading to issues in human<br>human patients we've also got another<br>marker that we use this is a CCL 2 gene<br>expression so against another mark if<br>that mark is present you would bring in<br>more macrophages into a tumor so it's a<br>marker that drives in macrophages so we<br>have this increase when we just change<br>that one make that one genetic change<br>and this is our work by romona who's a<br>PhD student in the lab and she's shown<br>if you just changed that and look at<br>teamers Olamide what you can see is that<br>the cells there<br>have that one genetic change if you<br>treat them with tea masala maybe there's<br>no difference in cell works so the blue<br>and red lines are exactly the same when<br>you have that p53 isoforms so the tea<br>masala mode is not able to stop those<br>cells from growing but in the control<br>cells are very very similar with the<br>exception that they don't have the p53<br>isoforms they are susceptible to tumors<br>Olamide and other drugs as well so with<br>all this work so we've done the we've<br>found something important in patient<br>tumors we've then looked at things in<br>the lab and shown yes this thing would<br>cause all these different markers that<br>would be associated with a more<br>aggressive tumor the next bit of this<br>project is to look at an animal model<br>and that's what's just being developed<br>at the moment so we're developing a new<br>animal model that only has this p53<br>isoforms in the cells that cause<br>glioblastoma and in patients that's blue<br>cells<br>so we're engineering them so then we can<br>look at if we just make that change will<br>we develop glioblastoma wall.that<br>glioblastoma have a change their immune<br>cells that are present and will they be<br>resistant to tea masala mind and if we<br>establish this model one of the biggest<br>issues in the glass timer field is<br>there's no good models for testing<br>things and that's hopefully we'll have a<br>model that we can look at and then we<br>can test the new drug so if we use those<br>immune checkpoint inhibitors retreat<br>with PDL one wall these patients have<br>improved prognosis and what combinations<br>of treatments that we can use so that's<br>the future work that's going to occur<br>and does the last of the talk so I've<br>talked about you look at something<br>important to patients you translate that<br>to the lab and you make sure that it's<br>important then you put it into an animal<br>model which can again give you more<br>evidence this is something you should<br>target and gives you evidence of what<br>you could target it with the next bit is<br>constantly as we're doing this we're<br>also including clinical trials along the<br>way I've got two they'll talk about some<br>involved in two clinical trials at the<br>moment so this one here this is<br>basically using<br>our our way of subtyping patience before<br>using all the molecular markers that<br>we've found this is a prospective study<br>done here at Otago and up north and<br>Waikato so what we're trying to do here<br>is making sure that all that group in<br>green that we had before that responds<br>to tumors ala mode will they get an even<br>those patients give them even better<br>prognosis now that T Mazama mode is<br>available for longer periods of time<br>we suspect that will be the case so that<br>will give us more evidence that this<br>identifying this group of patients is<br>really important so identify those<br>individuals that will respond to tea<br>masala mine it'll also give us more<br>evidence that the other groups are not<br>responding to tea masala mode and we<br>need new treatments for those<br>individuals and the second trial is very<br>important about and Jing Zhu is here<br>from radiology and she's been very very<br>key we've done a lot of work looking at<br>using radiology to better image our<br>subgroups but this is a new trial that's<br>about to start in Dunedin it's a<br>world-first<br>and what it is is one of the properties<br>of these macrophages is they can they<br>can scavenge iron and so what we can do<br>is we can give patients a type of iron a<br>small particle iron which is good USVI<br>i/o the macrophages will take up that<br>iron and we can actually image those<br>macrophages in the tumor using MRI<br>because there's a type of MRI contrast<br>agent and that is very very powerful<br>because not only will we be able to<br>image a poorer prognosis before surgery<br>this contrast agent might be very very<br>key at getting a better image of that<br>tumor so we might get it and so the<br>armored for example there's a<br>neurosurgeon might be able to remove<br>more of the tumor because we've got a<br>much better way of identifying the tumor<br>we also so that so we envision that<br>there will be a two main benefits to<br>patients at the target we'll be able to<br>predict our worst prognosis before<br>surgery so the surgeons will be aware<br>that this is going to be a very<br>aggressive tumor we might be able to get<br>better image of that tumor to remove a<br>much better part of<br>that Schumer and then the future the key<br>thing is at the moment we're very<br>limited at identifying people once their<br>tumors recur<br>so once patients get given radiotherapy<br>the current way of using MRI doesn't<br>work as effectively you get what we call<br>pseudo progression whether it looks like<br>there's a tumor present but it's not and<br>that's to do with issues with using the<br>current contrast agent but this agent<br>might be a much better way of picking up<br>tumors much earlier when they recur and<br>the other benefit is of course imaging<br>macrophages is going to have a lot of<br>benefits being able to see if some of<br>these targeted therapies are working<br>because we can't go into if you can<br>imagine if you've got a brain tumor we<br>can't just operate on you constantly to<br>see if your tumors come back but we can<br>if we were able to use MRI we'd be able<br>to image patients during a course of<br>time and pick up that tumor and much<br>much earlier and we'll also have a means<br>of being able to to see if the<br>treatments are effective and genes here<br>tonight so she can answer questions and<br>the relation to the tumor trial but this<br>is gene slide here so this is what genes<br>going to do she they're going to be in<br>Alma despo they're going to be screening<br>patients that come in to Dunedin to<br>identify those have glioblastoma they're<br>going to be consenting patients to take<br>part of this child to see if they would<br>like to have this very new MRI to better<br>image their tumor and then we're going<br>to follow up and check that their<br>macrophages do take up the iron because<br>we we suspect that will be the case and<br>that will be very important knowledge if<br>they do and there's many many people to<br>acknowledge so I try to acknowledge<br>people along the way just to make sure<br>that I don't exclude anyone so it's a<br>it's very important work and it involves<br>a big team of people having to work<br>together from the clinical side of<br>things right to the scientific side of<br>thank you very much time that was<br>fascinating in a great example that real<br>bench-to-bedside translational research<br>we use that with a patient in a clinical<br>issue you go back into the laboratory<br>you look at some some of the the key<br>things that are going on the laboratory<br>and then try to redesign and some<br>different changes to the way that<br>therapy works so do we have any<br>questions I guess I'll start I'm so it's<br>so does it just make collages do you<br>think it could be other cells and immune<br>cells as well that are involved I mean I<br>know you've mentioned T cells but it<br>could be other granule acidic cells that<br>are coming in that may be expressed some<br>macrophage markers but they're not sort<br>of true macrophages yeah so we we<br>suspect there and we've got hopefully<br>we've had someone from your lower back<br>she's there to help try to identify what<br>identify these immune cells a much<br>greater detail using flow cytometry so<br>at the moment we are limited we've done<br>immunohistochemistry but we don't<br>actually know what these macrophages are<br>or if they are mecha fighters a lot of<br>work in the literature sees or you they<br>will be this but we shot with we're<br>proving more and more that the type of<br>cells that are in tumors are quite<br>heterogeneous and they need to be<br>identified with much greater precision<br>and we've been doing this exam so if we<br>amaz right here so we asked covered for<br>as much pure as possible for everything<br>so presumably we could so there's a<br>technique that we can use to look at<br>protein peptides and year to identify<br>macrophages and elevate can use so many<br>different immune cells so that that<br>yes yeah so they were cd68 as well so<br>but it didn't correlate as well as the<br>CD 163 is the strongest market so the<br>other problem you might have seen<br>someone might have picked up there as<br>well<br>the other issue in the literature is<br>everybody sees or if there's any one six<br>three positive they'll be seized if one<br>hour positive why are you bothering but<br>they're not or that subgroup they had<br>the isoform to present do have more<br>series if when our positive cells but<br>there are tumors that have a lot of<br>macrophages cd16 three that weren't see<br>as if when our positive so again it's<br>bringing home the message that what's<br>happening in tumors is is quite<br>different to what you would predict if<br>you don't look at patient samples can<br>you talk into the microphone because<br>we've got people watching online I'm<br>just wondering if there any interim<br>results from their checkpoint inhibitor<br>trials in Guyana and how they're looking<br>other related to the expression of PDL<br>one in the patients and to my knowledge<br>people haven't looked and a lot of my<br>failing and as you can see that group<br>that I showed you the problem is I mean<br>you've got heterogeneous group of<br>patients you've got patients that will<br>civilize survive a long time regardless<br>of what treatment you're giving them so<br>that that group in pink you heard the<br>group that are responding because the<br>the trials still have to give patients<br>their current treatment which is team<br>has ala mode so you have groups that are<br>responding to the tumors online and then<br>you'll have groups that possibly would<br>respond to the PDL one inhibitors but if<br>you don't identify them earlier and look<br>at them before and after PDL one you<br>won't identify them so if you look at<br>your cohort as a whole just say Allah Jo<br>it's not just not working so it's<br>something that seems obvious to do but<br>people still ants aren't doing it<br>chicken which patients you should be<br>targeting first I think with the globe<br>lesson on being a heterogeneous so there<br>are many cell lines being there and the<br>tumor itself so whatever you take out<br>with one drug it will it's like bacteria<br>you know you kill one one type of<br>bacteria the other one won't flourish<br>and then you have this competition so<br>you take the one with the Mosel amide<br>and you give the others will flourish<br>later on this is what humans are my<br>trails after a while otherwise it'd kill<br>all the tumor cells<br>and this is the problem it's now what<br>we're looking at personalizing tumors I<br>mean patients with different sterile I<br>and they should have different<br>chemotherapy or or different approach<br>some of them surgery is better than<br>radiation some of them saying it doesn't<br>make any difference so this is where<br>this excellent work being done by by the<br>move I'm really proud the out of it<br>because I think the made most of the<br>work being done by these people I mean<br>I'm only the technician so the other<br>brain I am the muscle I mean I can just<br>obviously I'm an immuno immunologists so<br>there are a lot of trials at the moment<br>looking at combinations of cheap wound<br>inhibitors for exactly that reason if<br>you just target one you use one cheap<br>wound inhibitor you'll remove a certain<br>population themselves or take off the<br>checkpoint but then others can come in<br>or as a result kinesics of when they<br>come in and out of a tumor so there are<br>combinations that are going on in a<br>number of and that human might be<br>adapting I mean those cells are really<br>live they they change so whatever you do<br>they they they start resistance because<br>the second time or third time they're<br>visions they change me with chemotherapy<br>so it's not going to be easy but I think<br>so we've started looking at obese normal<br>weight in looking at some of the changes<br>we see in different kids is not go I<br>bless DOMA but actually also looking at<br>some of the changes that we see in<br>immune function in obese versus normal<br>weight and in one of the key things as<br>macrophage and filtration and the way<br>those macrophages work and people that<br>are overweight have you ever looked at<br>their in your patient cohort whereas<br>aware most people are not overweight are<br>they this is an excellent idea because<br>there was some talk about diabetes<br>glucose<br>yes so there might be association<br>between this I mean you know obese<br>patients of the resistant to insulin I<br>mean have they become diabetes or<br>diabetic I think Nolan was talking about<br>that increase you know the poor poorer<br>prognosis with people with diabetes I<br>mean we looked at other part of you know<br>me<br>you know we have some patients who have<br>for example asthma you know they do<br>better than automatic or quality they do<br>better<br>for example than patients who don't have<br>that is it because of the increased<br>expression of the p53 in asthma for<br>example you know there's always we<br>looked at that we look at as well of<br>interferon as part of of possible<br>treatment as well just just notice from<br>patients taught that many patients who<br>have left as summer they will tell me<br>they've never had a flu in their life<br>for some reason so so this world the<br>interferon came to place and this is<br>what came about resistance and obesity<br>diabetes other other other medical<br>medical condition metabolic<br>dysregulation are there any final<br>questions before we close up great well<br>please join with me in thanking Tonya</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
