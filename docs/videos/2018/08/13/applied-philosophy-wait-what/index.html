rocket Adama tena koe tow<br>tena koe tow tena tato katoa my name is<br>Harlan hain and I have the great<br>privilege of being the vice chancellor<br>here at the University of Otago and on<br>behalf of the university I would like to<br>warmly welcome everyone who is collected<br>here this evening to the inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor James<br>Maclaurin as I look out this evening<br>I see academic and professional staff<br>from the University of Otago I see<br>students from the University of Otago I<br>see former members of the University<br>Council<br>I see the former vice-chancellor of<br>another University and I see as always<br>members of the general public who often<br>used these inaugural professorial<br>lectures as part of their ongoing<br>education so welcome to you all<br>I'd also like to begin with a very<br>special welcome for members of James<br>family who are here with us this evening<br>his wife Kristen is here his son George<br>his mum Priscilla his brother Dave and<br>his sister-in-law Sonja and their<br>daughter Alice I know that your presence<br>here this evening is a very clear signal<br>of the importance of this particular<br>event and I know that your moral support<br>is going to be very important to James<br>as he delivers his lecture now as all of<br>you who are gathered here today who come<br>to these lectures often will know the<br>rank of a professor is the pinnacle of<br>academic success<br>it requires sustained excellence in<br>teaching in research and in service now<br>as you will soon learn from James<br>lecture he is a highly accomplished<br>researcher and a very very gifted<br>teacher what you may not learn from his<br>lecture however is about the massive<br>contribution that James has made to the<br>university more broadly he's the former<br>head of the philosophy department and<br>the<br>associate dean for research in the<br>division of humanities he's also served<br>from time to time as the acting PVC of<br>humanities he was the convener of the<br>divisional working party into 100 level<br>courses in humanities he was a member of<br>the research Action Plan working group<br>he is a regular facilitator for the<br>academic leadership and development<br>program here at Otago he regularly<br>participates in and chairs departmental<br>reviews he was one of the major driving<br>forces behind the incredibly successful<br>Bachelor of Arts and Sciences degree and<br>the list goes on and on and on but from<br>my perspective the most important part<br>of this story is that Professor<br>Maclaurin has a deep-seated<br>understanding of the joy inherent in an<br>academic career I have rarely if ever<br>seen him without a smile on his face he<br>takes a solution based approach to every<br>single problem he encounters and for me<br>he has always been a role model for the<br>way in which I want to live my academic<br>life so professor Maclaurin on behalf of<br>the University of Otago I would like to<br>warmly welcome you to give your<br>inaugural professorial lecture and I<br>would like to personally congratulate<br>you on your very well earned promotion<br>to Professor but before you speak I will<br>first call on professor Michael LaBeouf<br>the current head of the philosophy<br>department to tell us just a little bit<br>more about James academic journey<br>noreda tena koe tow tena koutou tena<br>Karara it's a great pleasure to be here<br>tonight to celebrate James's promotion<br>let me tell you a little bit about<br>James's life he was born here in Dunedin<br>grew up here in Dunedin attended<br>tigereye primary school found the Q and<br>intermediate I thought he was wearing a<br>red sweater this morning still but he's<br>changed Otago boys high school in 1979<br>james began study here at Otago<br>he's studying science law and the arts<br>an interdisciplinary interest that<br>you'll see comes up again he stopped in<br>1983 take a professional acting career<br>he's appeared in Shakespeare's as you<br>like it<br>Tom Stoppard's on the razzle Beth Helen<br>ease crimes of the heart and<br>one-man-show Samuel Beckett's Krapp's<br>Last Tape which he tells me was his most<br>difficult role in the early 90s James<br>returned to the University University of<br>Victoria University of Wellington<br>he completed honours and master's<br>degrees there and then went on to take a<br>PhD in philosophy from the Australian<br>National University in 1998 shortly<br>after finishing James joined Otago<br>philosophy and he's been a major<br>presence at the University since that<br>time professor Haines gave us a lot of<br>information stole it from me about<br>James's men deficit contributions to<br>service so let me say a little bit about<br>some of his other contributions James is<br>a fantastic teacher as I'm sure many of<br>you here know he won a tertiary teaching<br>excellence award in 2011 his hundred<br>level courses remain among the<br>university's most popular<br>he's extremely productive and<br>accomplished scholar publishing widely<br>across philosophy James's book what is<br>biodiversity published in 2008 as an<br>instant classic in that field he's also<br>published in philosophy of time<br>philosophy economics philosophy of<br>religion and meta philosophy when<br>humanities are very proud of James and<br>grateful for his contributions to the<br>division but a special trait of James is<br>his ability to reach out across the<br>university<br>we'll hear tonight about applied<br>philosophy and the way it reaches into a<br>bunch of different fields I'd like to<br>note that James has collaborative<br>projects across off all of the<br>university's academic divisions which<br>may be a record he's worked with<br>computer science law information science<br>tourism Public Health marketing and<br>ecology to give you just one recent<br>example of his work<br>James formed the artificial intelligence<br>and society group in 2016 with Colin<br>Gavigan from law and Ollie not from<br>computer science the group started with<br>just form informal meetings on Friday<br>afternoons but it blossomed quickly at<br>one major grants it founded a new<br>University Center in attracted interest<br>from the New Zealand government from the<br>Australian government and James has<br>given presentations internationally and<br>all the time in the field so change this<br>presentation tonight I'm sure you'll<br>hear much more about this the title is<br>yahaa to me a newie or - oh hey Toyota<br>hate Anita hate Anita Khurana Tata<br>couture thank you very much for those<br>very kind introductions I'll do my best<br>fundamental attribution error is that<br>interesting feature of human beings<br>whereby when things go well we stand a<br>little taller and we think about some<br>work that we did or a good idea that we<br>had and when things don't go our way<br>we say gee that was bad luck man this is<br>Chauncey don't you think Jhansi<br>it's a lovely illustration of the<br>difference between a strategies being<br>rational and it's being sensible it's<br>not really rational to interpret our<br>successes and our failures in such<br>different ways but it's not a bad way to<br>be if our successes are about our hard<br>work in our good ideas we bounced outta<br>bed in the morning and we put our<br>shoulder to those tasks that don't have<br>a great chance of success but be really<br>great if they came off and if our<br>failures are due to bad luck it cheers<br>us up when things don't go our way but I<br>think sometimes when things do go our<br>way we should think about luck and<br>tonight is a lot about the luck that<br>I've had in my life on my journey to<br>becoming an applied philosopher and in<br>my life luck has almost always been made<br>of people this is a book with two<br>chapters chapter one<br>Kristen Gillespie I married Kristen<br>Gillespie in 1994 Kristen Gillespie is a<br>wonderful and wise woman it is very<br>difficult being married to a philosopher<br>philosophers think arguments are good<br>things<br>philosophers want to argue about<br>everything which is annoying as Kristen<br>often nearly tells me to make matters<br>worse Kristen found a philosopher who's<br>sort of entrepreneurial I've always got<br>some scheme or idea or plan that I'm<br>trying to build or get going or<br>resuscitate as I've learned from the<br>great people that I go innovation over<br>the years being entrepreneurial it's a<br>little bit about business a little bit<br>about money but really it's about what<br>happens when everything turns to custard<br>when this thing you've been working on<br>for a year or two years suddenly looks<br>like it's not going to come off and<br>every big project is like that at some<br>point it's tremendously important in<br>that sort of life to have somebody who<br>understands the ups and the downs who<br>will help you pick yourself up and get<br>back out into the world and that<br>somebody is Kristen it also if you want<br>to be an entrepreneur it really helps if<br>you're ridiculously optimistic<br>did I mention annoying cuz that's really<br>annoying<br>maybe most importantly it matters to<br>have somebody with whom you want to<br>celebrate this year's and Kristen gave<br>me the greatest gift that any<br>philosopher has ever got a George now<br>you may have heard of other gifts you<br>so I need to thank another group<br>before I get into this little story of<br>my career I've been a member of the<br>department of philosophy for 19 years<br>and that is nothing it's a drop in the<br>bucket in a department that has been<br>going for a hundred and forty nine years<br>the Department of Philosophy is an<br>amazing place to work it's had amazing<br>successes over the years I'm not going<br>to rehearse all the things that the<br>Department of Philosophy has done but I<br>love working there and I need to thank<br>all the philosophers a toda go in that<br>hundred and forty-nine years and<br>especially my colleagues now and<br>especially my students because they're<br>the ones who really teach you your<br>discipline as we all really know and<br>very especially he says scanning the<br>room I know he's in here Professor Alan<br>Musgrave there you are without whom<br>without whose guidance and encouragement<br>I wouldn't be here I really wouldn't be<br>there's one more group there's one more<br>group that I've got to say thank you to<br>before I start so you know that I've had<br>some sort of minor administrative roles<br>well I've had rather a lot of minor<br>administrative roles over the years most<br>of these roles they work because you ask<br>people for help again and again and<br>people say yes I've had the most astound<br>level of generosity displayed to me day<br>in day out from people at this<br>university it's just remarkable<br>yes academic staff but especially<br>non-academic staff who work and work and<br>work to get things right so that people<br>like me can give fancy lectures and wear<br>funny hats I'm so grateful to those<br>people it's a sad fact but true that<br>academics and I do this to the we notice<br>university administration when it<br>doesn't do what we thought it was going<br>to do or when we think it's broken or<br>something we don't notice it when it's<br>people working away behind the scenes to<br>help us do what we do so thank you to<br>all those people and a special thank you<br>to Allison Stewart who introduced me to<br>about half of those people the wonderful<br>Alison Stewart so you'll be glad to know<br>I'm not going to say much about<br>administration because I don't think<br>people find this a very compelling<br>subject but I am going to say one thing<br>I've noticed over the years in thinking<br>about university administration there's<br>two sort of vices that it's easy to fall<br>into and and one is the view that<br>administration is just it's just forms<br>its bureaucracy it's just annoying it<br>gets in the way if only we didn't have<br>it we could get so much done when of<br>course if we didn't have it we couldn't<br>get anything done nobody would get paid<br>there'd be no way to go there'd be no<br>lights or nothing would happen so that's<br>one voice the other vice and I feel this<br>occasionally when I'm in extremely long<br>meetings stage Direction turn light turn<br>right stare at the deputy<br>vice-chancellor research who isn't here<br>he loves very long meetings when you sit<br>in very long meetings all day<br>occasionally it's really tempting to<br>think that administration is sort of its<br>the thing you know it's what we do it's<br>it's most of the place that somehow what<br>motivates what we do this is also a<br>crazy view and to remind myself that<br>this is a crazy view I've invented a<br>game it's called for administrative<br>purposes there are two players player<br>one says something important<br>player 2 says for administrative<br>purposes I will demonstrate to you now<br>ready I love you for administrative<br>purposes I think I was an odd child<br>actually I'm pretty sure I than odd<br>child I i have strong memories of<br>reading the oxford english dictionary<br>concise every night before i went to bed<br>i read pages because I thought words<br>language are the most important thing<br>that we have yes there are people<br>building rocket ships yes there are<br>people curing diseases and these are<br>great things and without them the world<br>would be a worse place but if we didn't<br>have language or of language somehow<br>broke we've got nothing my first<br>academic hero is a man called mr.<br>Southerland I don't know his first name<br>he was my teacher in standard four<br>that's in the old money for young people<br>I was about 10 mr. Southerland was a<br>wonderful teacher he was bright and very<br>encouraging to a very distinctive young<br>boy who I later discovered to my horror<br>refused to have lunch with the other<br>children I wasn't bullied I don't think<br>I was unhappy I just wanted to be with<br>the teachers and they relented and let<br>me have lunch in the staff room<br>now I know you should use the word<br>tragedy for tragedies mr. Southerland<br>used to call me the actually boy<br>actually so I think my first real piece<br>of academic luck was meeting mr.<br>Sutherland my second piece was not being<br>murdered and buried in a shallow grave<br>by my classmates at the age of 10 Thank<br>You room 6<br>so my second piece of evidence that I<br>was a but that I was an odd child odd<br>insufferable tomato tomato<br>is from when I was 15 another great<br>teacher I had so many great teachers<br>Richard Corliss Brian Beasley wonderful<br>wonderful teachers but this guy was a<br>student teacher<br>we didn't haven't remembered his name he<br>taught history he was young it was the<br>late 1970s he looked like a footballer<br>he had long hair he had a thick glass<br>region accent gramma Gaia's region<br>swagger the whole deal and history was<br>his thing he was fantastic and imagine<br>our disappointment one day to discover<br>that he was sick we'd been waiting for<br>this class or weekend he didn't come and<br>instead the class was taken by the<br>physician who made an executive decision<br>that he would not teach history that day<br>instead his class would focus on the<br>prevention of shenanigans and halfway<br>through the class he spotted shenanigans<br>they often a corner was a boy paying far<br>too much attention to the inside of his<br>desk for young people in the room this<br>was back when desks had lids and you<br>could<br>now being a pheasant etre he had<br>cat-like reflexes one minute he was at<br>the front of the room<br>gently saddling toward me the next<br>minute he was right beside me would ping<br>open the lid of the desk grabbing the<br>offending item looking up to find a copy<br>everybody I knew went to church we all<br>went to church just the normal thing it<br>was fine it was what you did that's<br>where you met people but I didn't think<br>that I knew anybody who'd ever actually<br>read the Bible and these things<br>to me at fifteen seemed connected so I<br>decided I had to read the Bible and I<br>sat with the Old Testament I read it<br>before bed but it just put me to sleep<br>if you have issues with insomnia I can<br>recommend the Book of Numbers so I had<br>to read it during the day I read it at<br>school and I got caught this is this is<br>the first time when I can remember a<br>sort of fascination that followed me<br>through my life with why it is that<br>people believe what they believe and<br>this after all is fundamental to<br>critical thinking that I've spent a lot<br>of years teaching so I don't know if you<br>were cool at school obviously I was not<br>but I did learn a very valuable lesson<br>that day about the power of cultural<br>artifacts there are very few things that<br>can make a roomful of 15 year old boys<br>go suddenly completely silent and<br>pensive but the sight of a phys ed<br>teacher who thinks that he's unwittingly<br>outed a nascent theologian is one of<br>so I survived high school implausible I<br>know that I survived high school and I<br>got the University in 1979 this great<br>university in 1979<br>it's a very different place to the<br>University we see today fewer people<br>went to university really fewer people<br>had the opportunity to go to university<br>it was a less diverse place which wasn't<br>so good I think it was a less intense<br>place which maybe was a little bit<br>better people didn't arrive at<br>university with a sort of laser-like<br>focus and focus on what job they wanted<br>to do in life and how the degree was<br>going to get them that job University<br>for me was like a kid in a sweet shop<br>for me it was just it was freedom I<br>could do anything I wanted I did Natural<br>Sciences I did life sciences psychology<br>philosophy law education computer<br>science anything you know it was the<br>sort of kid that that people look at<br>their academic record and say what what<br>what what are you trying to do<br>I don't know what I was trying to do I<br>was just free unfortunately that freedom<br>also extended to spending inordinate<br>amounts of time in the Student Union<br>reading very gloomy Russian novels<br>putting a whole lot of focus into<br>playing music very badly in and now<br>happily forgotten Flying Nun bed and<br>having an active social calendar which<br>has all the teachers in the room now<br>is a sort of shorthand for not being<br>very successful you know why I was a<br>little bit lost I think having a good<br>time bit lost until the University of<br>Otago worked its magic on me and taught<br>me the best thing the most important<br>thing that we ever teach anybody at<br>university that's you're gonna say is it<br>calculus no it's Greek it taught me how<br>to learn we talk a lot about learning<br>how to learn and I don't know that we<br>really think carefully enough about what<br>that is it's not business as usual you<br>know write that essay no not that way<br>that way they're excellent you've<br>learned how to learn let's have a cup of<br>tea you know that that's not what you're<br>doing learning how to learn is hard and<br>not everybody gets it so if you teach<br>first year you know that some young<br>people have learned how to learn before<br>they get to university you can see it<br>they hit the ground running as soon as<br>they get to university so I'm looking at<br>the teachers in the room that's not<br>everybody is it quite a lot of people<br>get to university and they hit the<br>ground<br>thundering<br>why is that learning how to learn<br>learning is risky really learning is<br>risky yes it's hard learnings hard but<br>it's risky you've just finished school<br>suddenly you're out in the world<br>everybody's been telling you everything<br>you got to do for your whole life and<br>now it's you down to you what are you<br>going to study which papers will you<br>take what are you going to live what do<br>you want for breakfast<br>oh yeah you're gonna write the essay we<br>just say well you're right how much time<br>you're gonna spin there's a party didn't<br>I go to the party it's suddenly it's all<br>down to you and if you really got to<br>university and decided right it's<br>chemistry for me and you threw yourself<br>into chemistry and told everybody this<br>is what I want to do this is what I'm<br>gonna do you put all what if it didn't<br>work wouldn't that be terrible and I<br>think that risk makes quite a lot of<br>young people cautious they take a<br>balanced approach there are a few<br>parties there is a little bit of essay<br>writing there's some reading there's a<br>little bit of going to lectures that's<br>not really learning so how do we get<br>over the hump have you get past this<br>luckily there's a mechanism we find<br>we've run into a subject that we love<br>something that makes us jump out of bed<br>in the morning there's suddenly we just<br>discover is us it's exciting we want to<br>talk about we want to go to the lectures<br>there's no question about whether we'll<br>spend time writing the essay we tell<br>people this is what we do we're one of<br>these people they're my peeps I do this<br>stuff and when you do that<br>suddenly learning takes off you take off<br>learning repays you now I'm thinking<br>that lots of you are thinking he's going<br>to say the subject that in which I<br>learned how to learn was philosophy it<br>wasn't it was theater<br>taught by the inimitable Lisa Warrington<br>he says staring at the inimitable Lisa<br>Warrington in the purple top just in<br>case you can't see it from where you're<br>sitting<br>Lisa gave me something that I'd loves<br>now people are very different a lot of<br>people think that standing up on stage<br>is you know up there with you know<br>having a dental appointment but for<br>somebody like me standing up on stage is<br>exciting and powerful<br>and risky and fundamentally<br>communicative and about humanity and<br>that was my thing suddenly I found my<br>thing and I threw myself into it and I<br>loved it and it loved me back I'm not<br>saying I was brilliant at it<br>but I learned boy did I learn and I got<br>to thinking that I could learn things<br>that's how you learn how to learn that's<br>I don't think I knew it then but I think<br>that taught me now I think there are two<br>big lessons in this one is I want to be<br>a teacher like you Lisa Warrington I<br>want young people to come and do<br>philosophy classes and think you know<br>this is my thing that's interesting<br>I'm going to talk to somebody about that<br>after class I want to write the essay<br>I'm gonna come wins it all next I'm<br>gonna come next time it's on I want<br>students to want to be in the room to<br>find this thing that's exciting for them<br>it's not going to be every student but<br>my job is to get as many students and<br>give them that thing second thing that<br>it taught me what are universities<br>universities why they Universal why do<br>we have to teach all these subjects<br>that's a lot of subjects why do we teach<br>them all in one place because people are<br>different really different and people<br>will find different things that they<br>love that will teach this most important<br>lesson to them and in humanities he says<br>you<br>sorry I embarrassed um buddy at<br>lunchtime I decide try it again this<br>evening we have four thousand seven<br>hundred eight hundreds going up by the<br>minute<br>effective full-time students who come to<br>study humanities at the University of<br>Otago so they've chosen that thing<br>that's our opportunity to teach them how<br>to learn and that's been a big part of<br>my life of my kind<br>we must have the humanities it's got to<br>be taught with depth and with passion at<br>Otago so I became an actor and it was<br>all those things it was fun and exciting<br>and there was a whole lot of waiting<br>round and there is thrills and spills<br>and all sorts of things happened rain on<br>the roof you don't know what that is ask<br>connector they'll tell you one day<br>Hilary this story isn't that story this<br>is my academic story so I'm sorry I'm<br>just gonna jump over that whole thing<br>now in 30 and I've been an actor for<br>eight or so years and I'm arresting<br>because actors occasionally are resting<br>and well resting I decided that I should<br>go back to university because I had left<br>Oh Tiger University to become an<br>apprentice at the fortune theatre eight<br>nine years before having half a BSc<br>two-thirds of a be a half a law degree<br>yeah exactly what that course advisor<br>told me I was going to end up with<br>that's what I ended up with so I thought<br>I'd better come back and do a degree<br>finish a degree and I chose philosophy<br>because I spend a lot of my life with<br>other people's ideas performing other<br>people's ideas and I wanted to know more<br>about ideas and I want to think about my<br>ideas so I thought right the world of<br>ideas it is for me I'll go back and<br>it'll be philosophy and I'd learned how<br>to loan<br>and it was great from day one and I<br>loved it and there's an honours degree<br>master's degree on mathematical<br>information theory as an interpretation<br>of the idea of genetic information so<br>I'm a philosopher of science then I went<br>worked in that time actually both at<br>Vick and at Anu because he moved<br>institutions with a philosopher called<br>Kim ster Ali Kim is a huge name and a<br>huge figure in philosophy worldwide<br>particularly in naturalistic philosophy<br>what's naturalistic philosophy whereas<br>what does that mean well think about<br>physics you can do physics in a very<br>sort of abstract mathematical way or you<br>can do it in a very practical sort of<br>engineering way what philosophy is<br>exactly the same you can do it in a very<br>kind of abstract logical way metaphysics<br>away or you can do it in the more sort<br>of philosophy of science ey ethics<br>political philosophy that sort of thing<br>so I'm over here there's obviously no<br>sense in which one of these things is<br>better than the other you need both<br>things but I just happen to be over that<br>side<br>Kim taught me a lot of things I was a<br>wonderful supervisor<br>these are wonderful supervisor but I<br>think the thing that I take away from my<br>time with Kim most of all is the idea<br>that everybody does philosophy in the<br>same way I hasten to add as everybody<br>does science right science at base is<br>observation<br>yes it's systematized it's engineered<br>when you're doing experiments it's<br>mathematize it's scholarly it's all<br>these things but at the back of it all<br>is observation philosophy at base is<br>deduction a sort of logical - almost all<br>of it is deduction so without going into<br>the gory details a deductive argument is<br>one in which if the premises are true<br>the conclusion has to be true cannot<br>possibly be false philosophers are<br>people this is a philosopher therefore<br>this is<br>a person it's not possible that the<br>first two sentences can be true and the<br>last one thoughts if we party uses<br>deduction all the time<br>what's it a pizza that we want where am<br>but philosophers systematize make<br>scholarly formalized think about really<br>difficult cases think about difficult<br>problems just as the scientists do but<br>once you think that really philosophy is<br>something that everybody does then it<br>strikes you that you could knock on<br>anybody's door you could knock on cats<br>door and say have you got any<br>philosophical problems you can't any<br>philosophical ideas that interest you<br>and it's amazing I've worked with so<br>many people in this university and<br>others and I don't think I've ever met<br>anybody who couldn't pretty quickly<br>articulate some philosophical idea or<br>issue concept that they understood that<br>they had would like to have a discussion<br>about maybe get some help on so I<br>drifted from being a philosophy science<br>into being a person who knocks on doors<br>into being an applied philosopher<br>somebody who works with people often in<br>other disciplines but somebody sometimes<br>with people in government I work with<br>anybody who wants some philosophy who's<br>got a philosophical problem once an<br>expert it's not always me I might not be<br>an expert but I can probably find you<br>one I love this work and as Mike said<br>I've worked with people in every bit of<br>the university it's it's very exciting<br>are all sorts of weird and wonderful<br>things and that led to a conversation on<br>Union Street nearly three years ago in<br>which I ran into alley not uses looking<br>for Ally I know he's out there I saw him<br>before<br>yah-hey around zou Ali Ali is an expert<br>in artifice<br>intelligence in the Department of<br>Computer Science and Ali said hey are<br>you interested in artificial<br>intelligence because it seems to me that<br>there's a huge amount of work being done<br>in artificial intelligence it's<br>developing very quickly it's getting<br>very powerful in particular domains but<br>I'm not sure that many people are really<br>working on what effects it's going to<br>have on what it might do with the way<br>that we live and work are you interested<br>in that and I just thought yes Thank You<br>Ali this was brilliant so we had a cup<br>of coffee and we sat down and we roughed<br>a few things out and we thought what<br>about things we might discuss and it<br>seemed to us that actually this might<br>have important effects on actually the<br>way we organize things on the way<br>society works perhaps on laws and<br>regulation and institutions and then we<br>realized that we didn't have enough<br>lawyers because you never have enough<br>lawyers Nicola but in particular the<br>lawyer we needed is somewhere up there I<br>saw him before<br>: Hey we rang Colin who's an expert in<br>emerging technologies law and from that<br>grew the artificial intelligence and<br>society group that met many weeks of the<br>year and discussed all sorts of<br>wide-ranging things and out of that grew<br>the artificial intelligence a law in New<br>Zealand project funded by New Zealand<br>law foundation our work with the<br>artificial intelligence and Australia<br>project funded by the Department of<br>Prime Minister and cabinet in Australia<br>to work out how much money they want to<br>spend it's just I watering what they've<br>got has been that led to the development<br>of the Center for artificial<br>intelligence and public policy which<br>Colin and I co-direct which is nearly<br>we're so close nearly signed an MoU with<br>I'm getting the thumbs up from Kirby<br>we're in signed an MoU with government<br>to work with the government we have a<br>partner center you're a Huayra Center<br>and practical ethics at Oxford that we<br>visit annually it's<br>been an amazing ride it's a very<br>exciting area to work in<br>and I want to to just give you a few<br>examples of some of the issues that<br>we're interested in that I think well I<br>hope will help us to think about what I<br>is going to do for us and might say<br>something about this relationship<br>between science and the humanities which<br>autonomous vehicles promise so much they<br>could be safer than vehicles driven by<br>people there could be more efficient<br>they could be much better for the<br>purposes of traffic management they<br>could do all sorts of things it could be<br>comfortable you could sit in birches you<br>wouldn't have to look at the road all<br>this sort of thing but of course we're<br>not there yet<br>we've got semi autonomous vehicles and<br>they're all very exciting actually a<br>little scary to Ryden but but they're<br>out there our group has driven through<br>the centre of Dunedin I'm not sure if I<br>should say this no hands no feet it was<br>serviced but at the moment we don't have<br>technology that lets the car drive on<br>itself on its own without supervision so<br>at the moment we are required to have a<br>monitor so you and I are drivers when we<br>drive when you're sitting in an<br>autonomous vehicle and it's doing the<br>driving<br>you're a monitor and you've got to sit<br>there and watch the road<br>and if you don't do something if you<br>don't touch the wheel or give the car<br>some indication that you're monitoring<br>it'll beep or flash a light or do<br>something depending on the make of car<br>every few minutes it's kind of scary<br>stand<br>so who's in charge of that autonomous<br>vehicle how's that working in a moral<br>sense in the legal sense in a practical<br>sense<br>what's the entity that's making the<br>decisions interesting thing about an<br>autonomous vehicle or the Mercedes that<br>we drove in it's not like cruise control<br>you know you tap the brake and cruise<br>control turns off autonomous vehicle it<br>wants to go that way and you want to go<br>don't get things wrong what are you<br>Neville Stanton is a psychologist who<br>recently visited that about in the<br>psychology here it gave a fantastic<br>lecture so never works on this problem<br>in the UK with fighting Land Rover<br>Jaguar<br>so his what Neville said about driving<br>an auto Surrey monitoring an autonomous<br>vehicle a driver has a reaction time for<br>a major event on the road on average<br>about 0.6 of a second we're pretty quick<br>at noticing something and doing<br>something about it but our brains a lot<br>attention based on what we are doing not<br>on what we're monitoring so they a lot<br>attention based on activity so if you<br>are sitting there not doing anything<br>your reaction time to a major event on<br>average is more than three seconds<br>that's a big gap in which stuff can<br>happen as Neville says the thing that<br>driving an autonomous you know we're<br>being sold these days that you know call<br>you buy an autonomous vehicle the thing<br>that monitoring an autonomous vehicle is<br>most like is like teaching a teenager to<br>drive you're sitting there things are<br>so the technology isn't quite ready for<br>primetime but these other questions<br>these sort of moral questions legal<br>questions we know who's in control what<br>are we doing here there's a danger that<br>what we're creating is what's known<br>colorfully in the business as a moral<br>crumple zone a moral crumple zone is<br>somebody who's put in charge of<br>something responsible for something that<br>they can't really control so it's very<br>stark in the case of autonomous vehicles<br>but actually this pops up wherever we<br>have people supervising AI if I buy a<br>system like compass<br>that's advising me whether or not to let<br>somebody out on parole and I'm sitting<br>on the parole board and it's a black box<br>and it says let them out and we think no<br>what are we going to do open it up look<br>at the wiring it costs a lot of money we<br>don't know we must have bought it for<br>some reason I guess it knows more than<br>we do so this problem of control and<br>supervision<br>it's a really important issue at the<br>moment where we're deploying artificial<br>intelligence and we nervous about the<br>effects of artificial intelligence<br>because it's doing something very<br>important it's letting people out of<br>prison or letting you into the country<br>at the smart gate or working out whether<br>you'll get a hip operation what do we do<br>if we're not sure about whether it's<br>good enough we've got a human in the<br>loop that's the phrase well what do we<br>get when we put a human in the loop<br>sometimes I think good results but<br>unpredictable very multidisciplinary<br>problem really important if we want to<br>get benefit out of these systems we want<br>to use them after intelligence really<br>powerful can do wonderful things for us<br>got to be able to use it in the right<br>sort of way so that's that's one issue<br>let me tell you about another technology<br>pred Paul short for predictive policing<br>is a system that was designed by<br>a an anthropologist at UCLA Jeffrey<br>branding ham print poll is a big data<br>system that aggregates statistics about<br>arrests and convictions and employees<br>information about how criminals behave<br>in working out if this house was robbed<br>how likely is it is it that somebody<br>will rob the house next door<br>if somebody's robbing dearies how likely<br>is that they'll keep robbing dairies as<br>opposed to petrol stations as opposed to<br>something else and what it does is it<br>produces one a known as heat maps you<br>get these maps with square boxes around<br>them and that says this is where to send<br>the police cars tonight it promises to<br>be accurate it's based on real<br>information about where we're making<br>arrests it promises to be objective to<br>be efficient it lets you use the same<br>number of police cars but to get greater<br>effect out of it so we've got all this<br>data about where we're arresting people<br>why are we arresting all the people over<br>there where were we sending the police<br>guys all over there why do we set it<br>over that well look that's where we send<br>them on Friday night so that's where we<br>make all the arrests and the data tells<br>us that that's where the crime is<br>happening and we don't know this is an<br>example of a predictive risk model<br>history isn't always a good thing<br>there's lots of history we don't want to<br>aggregate so in thinking about no now<br>don't get me wrong<br>Amazon Spotify anybody predictive risk<br>models same thing aggregating history he<br>keeps reading books like this I'll keep<br>giving him books like that<br>pretty good most of the time sometimes<br>crazy perfectly fine spotify amazon i<br>don't care i don't care if it profiles<br>me on spotify you know it gives me music<br>based on the fact that it thinks I'm a<br>middle-aged white guy who listened and<br>even that would be fine<br>but what if we're using that to work out<br>so when we build these systems there are<br>really just statistical systems there<br>based on information that we have about<br>the world and they're allowing us to<br>make predictions about the world we have<br>to think about what the consequences of<br>those systems are what successes and<br>failures in the system look like what it<br>is that we want systems like this to do<br>really powerful really useful pretend<br>potentially risky LinkedIn had a system<br>I think they've stopped now had a system<br>where it automatically recommended the<br>top 25 likely employees for any job that<br>you'd put on on the market historical<br>data all the people who used to just do<br>this job middle-aged white guys so who<br>are they gonna predict is it going to be<br>the best person to do it now whoa hold<br>on we don't want that one last case and<br>it's the case that everybody's heard of<br>are we gonna run out of jobs how many<br>jobs are we going to run out of is it<br>forty six percent of jobs are going to<br>disappear now it's 12 is it look thirty<br>one it won't hold on we've got all sorts<br>of predictions why have we got so many<br>predictions about how many jobs are<br>going to disappear well what are we<br>trying to do here how are we making<br>these predictions so in part we're<br>making these predictions based on how we<br>think science is going to progress<br>science progresses in a stepwise fashion<br>I don't need to tell you this you know<br>ordinary science discovery ordinary<br>the traits in the rises and the<br>staircase are different lengths five<br>years out we can make pretty good<br>predictions twenty years out 30 years<br>out we have a long history of being<br>complete rubbish at predicting the<br>progress of science so we've got this<br>fundamental epistemic problem how do we<br>how we learn about this jobs aren't<br>static you know so we're saying how many<br>jobs are going to disappear have<br>blacksmiths disappeared well there<br>aren't half as many of them as they used<br>to be hardly any blacksmiths but there<br>are still blacksmith what is it for a<br>job to disappear jobs change all the<br>time the contours of jobs change all the<br>time<br>and whether or not a job disappears or<br>whether or not we employ artificial<br>intelligence for some particular purpose<br>depends on people on us so think about<br>things that have been automated recently<br>insurance selling you know could could<br>that be automated<br>I don't know insurance salespeople they<br>involve them you know lots of social<br>interaction surely we can't actually you<br>know imitate that in a machine turns out<br>insurance sales shot online people don't<br>really like being with insurance<br>salespeople they don't like that process<br>so we'll make do with less of the<br>personal interaction because we want<br>that to be automated<br>now think about going to the supermarket<br>this isn't really a i but it is<br>automation think about going to the<br>supermarket checkout robots some<br>supermarkets have lots of them some<br>supermarkets have hardly any of them the<br>ones that have lots of them are cheap<br>back and so the ones that don't have<br>many or none are expensive what does<br>that tell you people actually don't like<br>them you know they would pay not to have<br>a robot they would pay to have a person<br>who says hi and we'll pack the groceries<br>and not wonder what your waiters or not<br>be able to tell how old you are or all<br>those things that the checkout robots<br>can't do so well you know what gets<br>automated and how things get automated<br>rests a lot on people so this is<br>actually a really really hard problem<br>how many jobs are going to go problem<br>but also in a way it's just the wrong<br>question to ask Taylor ization is that<br>process whereby we chop jobs into bits<br>you know in common China a time in<br>motion you know the process that when we<br>industrialized lots of things so you<br>have an artisan who makes a chair she<br>starts at the beginning she gets the<br>wood she makes the chair she sells the<br>chair she does everything kind of the<br>the market version you know therefore<br>the farmers market version of making a<br>chair when you tailor eyes that job<br>somebody gets the would you cut the<br>whole job up into lots and lots of<br>little bits somebody does this but<br>screws in that screw somebody puts that<br>bit on somebody else does the selling<br>artificial intelligence tail arises jobs<br>doesn't terrorize them in that way but<br>it chops jobs up because oh I can do<br>some things that people like you and I<br>can do but it can't do other things and<br>so we've got this really interesting and<br>again very difficult to predict<br>phenomenon where different bits of<br>different jobs are getting changed so<br>the jobs themselves are changing it's<br>not about which job disappear it's about<br>how work changes so I think the future<br>you know for us is not about jobs<br>disappearing it's about changing work<br>and that's a really interesting problem<br>for for us as teachers as as University<br>again these are really interdisciplinary<br>problems political and philosophical<br>ethical sociological economic the whole<br>deal all right let me draw two<br>conclusions then I'll stop what does<br>this tell us about universities so<br>what's the world of work gonna be like<br>in 20 years we don't know will jobs<br>disappear probably not not while jobs<br>continue<br>to be the fundamental organizing<br>principle for distributive justice you<br>know you you get money proportionate to<br>the sort of work you do that's how<br>organized societies organized we could<br>change it but at the moment this is a<br>huge driver to make jobs remain will<br>they be the same jobs who jobs be<br>distributed in the same sort of way will<br>this effect inequality there's some<br>evidence in the last few decades that<br>high paying jobs and low paying jobs are<br>getting more common and the jobs in the<br>middle are getting a wee bit less common<br>but that's the last couple of decades we<br>don't know what's gonna happen in the<br>next few decades will we at some point<br>decide you know hey I actually can do<br>lots of these things that we do and<br>there is a group of people who don't<br>work who are actually very happy we call<br>them which people could a I make us<br>which people would we like it to make it<br>as rich people would that be a better<br>thing I think what this tells us that's<br>a university as an institution is that<br>the days when we get got to university<br>and we had this laser-like focus on one<br>job that was going to remain the same<br>and we would have for the rest of our<br>days and we would do this degree that<br>would get us that job and then we run in<br>a way we go think those days are likely<br>the graduates of the future I think need<br>to be broad need to be renascence people<br>need to have really wide skill sets need<br>to be the sort of people who can get out<br>in the world and do lots of different<br>jobs need to have learned that greatest<br>lesson that we teach learning how to<br>learn<br>that's our job I think from here on in<br>all right one last one last conclusion I<br>want to draw here's the slogan but if<br>you mean tomorrow what did that guy say<br>I don't know so if this one thing if<br>there's one thing that you take away<br>from this lecture here's the phrase it's<br>not a seesaw thank you very much what<br>does that mean so we live in an era<br>which is very technological in which<br>technology is very important in our<br>lives and the science behind it is very<br>important in our lives and very valuable<br>is it a seesaw if the humanities if<br>science is fundamental and important the<br>humanities is not very important not<br>very valuable so what I've tried to show<br>by talking about all these examples is<br>that actually this is crazy<br>to quote my old mate Jeremy Bentham it's<br>nonsense on stilts if science is leaping<br>forward and progressing the humanities<br>needs to leap forward and progress<br>Commerce needs to leap forward and<br>progress at the same rate if we want<br>these technologies to give us the<br>benefits that they can really exciting<br>benefits and we want to ameliorate risks<br>and we want the world to be the way we<br>want it not just the way that Google<br>wants it we need to do this work this is<br>really important work for the humanities<br>it's my job thank you very much<br>tena koutou katoa my name is Tony<br>Valentine and I'm the PVC humanities<br>here at the University I was just saying<br>to James that I have the hardest job in<br>the university right now just to follow<br>what is fair so it really is a great<br>pleasure that I deliver this photo of<br>thanks to Professor Maclaurin he's<br>delivered a truly exceptional victim I<br>think of reflections on his own academic<br>pathway and some of the recurrent<br>concerns that stand at the center of his<br>teaching in his research its departure<br>at the point this evening was the most<br>fundamental part of all academic<br>experiences in this university learning<br>how to learn a phrase that recurred<br>through James's talk he reminded us that<br>that process isn't natural necessarily<br>nor is it necessarily easy and he has<br>reminded us of just how important the<br>example of a great teacher is so we<br>heard about his standard for teacher mr.<br>Southerland and Lisa Warrington it is<br>all too easy I think to forget and the<br>routines of our existence here in the<br>university just how important the work<br>we do in the classroom is it's easy to<br>take that for granted what James has<br>reminded us I think is about the power<br>of great teachers to inspire and to help<br>initiate really significant<br>transformation and that's a really very<br>important message he then took us with<br>him on his research journey a journey<br>that developed through his return to<br>University and then his PhD studies with<br>come strone<br>at Anu and then the subsequent<br>development of his work here I think<br>through this narrative we got a sense of<br>the working of an intensely curious mind<br>but also I think quite intriguingly the<br>role of happenstance and coincidence and<br>shaping research victories so bumping<br>into le not on union streets having a<br>coffee and thinking about common<br>interests great examples of the way in<br>which our<br>encounter perhaps can set somebody on a<br>new trajectory and pose compelling new<br>questions now of course that work that<br>James has been doing on artificial<br>intelligence as part of a wider<br>constellation of problems and ideas that<br>James has turned his attention to and<br>this evening we've thought with him<br>through driverless cars predictive<br>policing and the future of work for<br>James each of these issues is an<br>opportunity to think philosophically to<br>interrogate how ideas and arguments are<br>formed and articulated in an opportunity<br>to develop clearer and more incisive<br>modes of analysis and James's hands<br>these questions are also an opportunity<br>to demonstrate the ability of his<br>beloved discipline of philosophy and<br>humanistic inquiry more generally to<br>engage with issues that are often seen<br>as belonging to the domain of science<br>James pushes hard against any notion of<br>these being part of two irreconcilable<br>cultures of learning the arts and the<br>sciences and that is something that is<br>very clear from his lecture this evening<br>and also from his way of being in this<br>institution James is a great connector<br>he is an intellectual bridge he forges<br>connections linkages and pathways<br>between parts of the university that are<br>too often separate and self-contained<br>and I think that breach is just very<br>obvious looking around the room looking<br>at this audience this evening we have<br>folks from right across the university<br>from philosophers to computer scientists<br>from lawyers to theologians from<br>economists to English scholars but we<br>also have a great number of students and<br>a large number of folks from the city so<br>I think that's a testament to the range<br>of James's thought so Professor<br>Maclaurin we have greatly enjoyed your<br>lecture it has not just been a<br>I think it has been a tour de force full<br>of compelling ideas and challenging<br>questions delivered with an<br>irrepressible energy Verve and great<br>humor I think Heather's embodies the<br>richness and full range of possibilities<br>that the lecture form still offers so<br>James we have really enjoyed coming<br>together to join in the celebration of<br>your promotion of your work and the<br>contribution you make to our institution<br>so could I invite you all to join me and<br>thanking James I have a gift to present<br>to him and after that I would encourage<br>you all to join the academic party in<br>the staff club for a reception</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
