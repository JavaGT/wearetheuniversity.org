automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening my name is Harlan hain and<br>I have the distinct pleasure of being<br>the Vice Chancellor of this wonderful<br>University and it is my distinct honor<br>to be here with you this evening as many<br>of you who come to these will know this<br>is one of the highlights of my week<br>because it's a time where all of the<br>busy people who are in this room have<br>taken time out of their schedules to<br>come and partake the outstanding<br>academic brilliance that is the<br>professorial of the University of Otago<br>many times what I stand here I remind<br>people that being promoted to professor<br>in this institution is a bit like<br>becoming the Pope it's a very very<br>difficult and arduous process that takes<br>people a very long period of time and<br>only the best and the brightest actually<br>achieve it so actually being the person<br>who stands up here this evening to give<br>their inaugural professorial lecture it<br>really does indicate a huge achievement<br>over the course of an entire career so<br>it is a fantastic opportunity to see<br>people from all academic divisions<br>coming together to spend an hour and<br>enjoying the brilliance of Professor<br>Katherine day I would now like to hand<br>over to Professor helen nicholson who is<br>going to tell us a little bit about<br>Katherine's performance to date so good<br>evening it's my pleasure to introduce<br>Katherine day to you<br>Katherine was brought up in pea tour in<br>the wire wrapper and she coming from an<br>agricultural background her first<br>interest was being a becoming a vet but<br>she was told that she wasn't strong<br>enough they obviously didn't know<br>Katherine then instead she went to the<br>local school at makamaka and then went<br>to Masterton to high school and then on<br>to Massey where she did a BSC in<br>biochemistry and genetics and honours<br>and then a PhD with John Tweedy and Ted<br>Baker at Massey after that she went to<br>the University of California in Berkeley<br>where she did a postdoc with Professor<br>Tom abla<br>and worked on various things including<br>determining the structure of the tumour<br>suppressor protein APC and then in 1995<br>she was lured back to New Zealand on a<br>post force postdoc fellowship and she<br>her desire then was to establish her own<br>group which she did looking at protein<br>protein interactions particularly around<br>the process of apoptosis and she<br>developed some collaborations then<br>particularly with people in weihai which<br>she continues to this day in 2001 she<br>moved to Otago to take up a lectureship<br>with the expectation that she would stay<br>here just for five years twelve years<br>later or eleven years later thankfully<br>she's still here and so she quickly<br>settled into a Targo she was promoted<br>within two years of her being here to<br>senior lecturer and since that time she<br>has been continuously funded either by<br>Marsden or HRC or both she has published<br>extensively in high impact factor<br>journals established her group here has<br>graduated a good number of PhD students<br>and is now internationally recognized in<br>her area of strecher<br>structural biology and apoptosis as well<br>as her numerous publications she's been<br>invited as an invited speaker<br>internationally all around the world and<br>in 2010 was awarded the New Zealand<br>Society for became biochemistry and<br>molecular biology Life Technologies<br>prize as well as being herself an active<br>researcher and training her own group<br>and her own students catherine has taken<br>an active role in promoting science and<br>facilitating science within New Zealand<br>she's been on various assessing panels<br>including the HRC assessing but one of<br>the HLC assessing panels and certainly<br>from the school's point of view for the<br>last four years she's been our associate<br>dean research and does her has done a<br>fantastic job<br>developing research across the school<br>and also helping to develop and and<br>support young and emerging researchers<br>so it's my great pleasure to welcome<br>Katherine day to give her talk which is<br>called molecular assemblies and cell<br>suicide<br>okay so well think thanks to howleen and<br>to Helen for the kind words and thank<br>you to all of you for taking time out of<br>your busy schedules to come that's<br>really a privilege to have see so many<br>faces here many oh I know but a few I<br>don't I think so thank you all for<br>taking the time to attend so I'm going<br>to talk today about molecular assembly<br>x' and in particular i'm going to talk<br>about protein assemblies and how they<br>can regulate cell survival or cell death<br>in this case and in particular i'm going<br>to talk about two examples where my<br>group has made a contribution to our<br>understanding of proteins function which<br>has then enabled the dekor helped with<br>the development of anti-cancer compounds<br>which are currently in clinical trials<br>and so this I guess is to take these two<br>examples to represent research in my<br>laboratory and I guess before I start<br>talking about the details I'll just sort<br>of want to step back and talk a little<br>bit about the cell and here I have shown<br>a schematic and actually I should thank<br>Bronwyn Carlile for a lot of help with<br>the schematics that we'll see as we go<br>through the talk so this is a schematic<br>of the cell and it so comprises many<br>things and in particular many of you<br>will know that the cell comprises a DNA<br>or the genome and we've heard a lot<br>about the genome in the last ten years<br>really through that the pioneering work<br>of genome sequencing projects and we<br>know that now that the human genome<br>encodes 30,000 genes there's actually<br>far fewer genes than we expected and<br>really surprising an absence of genes<br>which is kind of an interesting thing<br>about human cells because plants have<br>far more genes than what we do and so<br>really then it's meant that we've had to<br>look in other places for the complexity<br>of these cells and this really at least<br>a lot of the complexity lies in the<br>proteins so as a gene is transcribed and<br>translated we get a linear polypeptide<br>of amino acids which then turn into a<br>three-dimensional structure and I'll<br>come back to these three-dimensional<br>structures but I've represented these<br>here as filling up the cell and they're<br>found throughout the cell<br>and it's really we have to we're going<br>to manipulate the cell and its functions<br>its comes back to manipulating the<br>activity of these proteins and thinking<br>about how we can modulate these a small<br>video clip here which is really a<br>schematic trying to represent the the<br>inside of a cell and the large number of<br>proteins that are found in this cell and<br>this is really a very competent rying to<br>show it and think about what's inside of<br>the cell we often think of a single<br>molecule that we're working on but it's<br>really a full and busy place with a lot<br>of proteins and they are constantly<br>running into each other but most of<br>those interactions result in nothing and<br>it requires a specific interaction of<br>proteins which are supposed to interact<br>which results in activity and we can see<br>these busy proteins colliding here and<br>we are assembling a machine and these<br>kinds of protein assemblies are what<br>controls the action of the cell and they<br>will assemble in response to a given<br>signal and then result in specific<br>activities and we can see these busy<br>proteins coming together and then in<br>this case we're activating some<br>molecules which will then go on in<br>chopped up things and this is really you<br>can think of these molecules as a bit<br>like the hungry enzymes and your laundry<br>detergents that I think that are<br>commonly used in ads and they go along<br>and they munch up things and so that's<br>just to kind of to give you a picture of<br>the busy place that are sellers and I<br>guess proteins are pretty complicated<br>things<br>where did my interest in proteins begin<br>well it began as a PhD student at Massey<br>when I worked with our professor Ted<br>Baker this is a picture of him from<br>about that time and he had a group that<br>included Heather Baker and Brian<br>Anderson and Jill Norris who's not here<br>who were long-standing member are not<br>showing here long thing the members of<br>his group and then my project actually<br>was a joint project in the early years<br>mostly supervised by a perfect associate<br>professor John Tweedy and I think<br>nowadays we would call this a<br>multidisciplinary project or some such<br>thing because it was really what I did<br>and Ted's lab was to make an Express and<br>purify the first recombinant protein so<br>up until that time the study of proteins<br>had largely been limited well it's in<br>the early years to proteins that you<br>could purify from natural sources and so<br>people would go to the abattoir or grow<br>up a yeast culture and purify something<br>and so you were extracting proteins and<br>so really what I did was to make the<br>first recombinant protein and that Baker<br>laboratory and so this required me to a<br>clone and overexpressed my protein so I<br>could analyze it and that at least at<br>Massey you that at this time this wasn't<br>such an easy process because we had no<br>PCR machines now most of our<br>undergraduate students get to do PCR<br>reactions and things but I had to go to<br>add research to use the PCR machine and<br>then in fact I didn't and nowadays many<br>of the students who I see here they<br>would purify their proteins from a coli<br>actually I set up a mammalian expression<br>system which was quite a challenge given<br>that was our first efforts to make<br>recombinant proteins for that I went to<br>Vancouver for two week two months to<br>establish the system and then I came<br>home and established that here and this<br>was a complicated expression system<br>where we had to express the protein in<br>the soluble media and recover it really<br>not a trivial endeavor and then we had<br>to purify it and I guess I kind of like<br>the fact this pngs if the protein that<br>we pure that was a secreted was<br>glycosylated and we had to remove the<br>carbohydrate and so we couldn't buy P&amp;G<br>a thief at that time which is Adi<br>glycosylated an enzyme that would chop<br>the carbohydrate off and did we would<br>grow big cultures of flavor bacterium in<br>and decepticon and we would purify it<br>from there and really we didn't require<br>nearly the compliance that I suspect we<br>would need to do that nowadays<br>so once we had purified my protein I<br>crystallized it and then I sold the<br>structure of this protein so this is<br>of the lobe half of the structure of<br>human lactoferrin so lactoferrin has<br>found and secreted fluids so it's<br>particularly it gets its name because<br>it's very prevalent and I'm the man<br>human milk or mammalian milk and really<br>the great thing about being able to make<br>recombinant proteins is that we could<br>make mutants and analyze them when<br>you're purifying proteins from natural<br>sources you can't make a mutant so you<br>can't specifically investigate the role<br>of a given amino acid and so this was<br>really the the great thing about being<br>able to make recombinant proteins and so<br>really the system I established in Ted's<br>lab we lot of mutant so I made and<br>they've formed actually the basis for a<br>large number of projects and I think<br>actually I think there are eight or ten<br>papers that resulted from that work<br>because I effectively set up a system so<br>if we just take a few moments and look<br>here so what do we learn by solving the<br>structure of a protein so this we learn<br>a lot of different things but we learn<br>about topology so when a protein is<br>synthesized as a linear sequence that's<br>not the form it takes it folds up so<br>that specific groups come into close<br>proximity and we can see this here so we<br>have different elements of secondary<br>structure that we would refer to these<br>arrows and these twelve and in these<br>squiggly bits<br>so these therefore define the structure<br>that we have so we learn about topology<br>we also learn about the surface and as<br>we all talk more about a lot of my work<br>has been focused on protein protein<br>interactions so that's really how to to<br>proteins bind to each other and it's<br>these surface properties that are<br>important for that we also learn a lot<br>about the chemistry of the proteins and<br>how things are bound so lactoferrin is<br>an iron binding protein that's its role<br>in the it is to bind iron tightly and<br>and keep it away from bacteria<br>effectively and so we in the structure I<br>solve we could see that the iron is<br>coordinated here by these specific<br>groups of atoms in a very specific<br>arrangement and then really when I made<br>mutants we can investigate the role of<br>these do<br>residues and see how they function so<br>these are some of the different things<br>we learn by solving a protein and we can<br>represent our proteins in these<br>different ways and then sometimes it's<br>just easiest to represent our protein as<br>a nice little sphere and you'll see a<br>lot of these in my talk because if I<br>show all of these big complicated<br>structures sometimes things on this so<br>these are the different ways that you'll<br>see me represent a protein so as I'm<br>Helen indicated after I left<br>but messy I went to Berkeley and to work<br>in the lab of Tom Alber he was really a<br>great supervisor and I worked on<br>proteins and I solved the structure of a<br>domain involved in or in a protein<br>involved in colon and had inherited<br>susceptibility to colon cancer but I<br>learned a number of things there and<br>perhaps one of the things when I moved<br>to Berkeley he also had just moved to<br>Berkeley so I learnt about setting up a<br>lab because I had to buy the chairs and<br>the glassware and measuring cylinders so<br>I might have done less work but I think<br>I learned quite a lot in his laboratory<br>and I also really where I developed my<br>interest in cancer and so for the rest<br>of today I'm really going to talk a lot<br>about proteins involved in cancer and<br>how they are and how we can manipulate<br>these for I guess for the benefit of<br>help for our benefit so just to step<br>back a moment when we think of cancer if<br>we think of this is just a<br>representation and of a monolayer of<br>cells and on the this side we've got<br>normal cell division occurring and on<br>this side we've got some so division<br>that might that's representing what<br>might be occurring and again cancer and<br>you can see here that these ones form a<br>nice layer nothing's kind of they're all<br>just nothing nice Lange up against each<br>other things are looking quite orderly<br>here things are starting to go out of<br>control and this is really what happens<br>when when a tumor is forming and so this<br>is really what we think of as tumor<br>formation and so<br>this really then tells us that there's a<br>critical balance between cell division<br>and cell death and so it really it's<br>amazing that we don't get more diseases<br>because this has really got to be a<br>tightly controlled process and on this<br>on the the this video clip that we just<br>saw on the left our solar visions being<br>exactly balanced by cell death and so<br>you get this perfect balance of number<br>and really for most of us once we're<br>adults of always going well we stay<br>roughly the same size and we have<br>roughly the same number of cells and so<br>this is really a really exquisitely<br>balanced process and if we get an<br>imbalance between division and death or<br>apoptosis and proliferation and I'm<br>probably going to use a pitocin skree<br>Qin t really that means so dis then we<br>get various disorders so when we've got<br>so the fact that a cell becomes damaged<br>is not in and of itself a problem<br>because normally there are lots of<br>pathways to remove those damaged cells<br>but if they're not removed we get this<br>accumulation or imbalance of cell number<br>and that's as we have just seen what<br>often occurs in a cancer state we also<br>have disorders associated with too much<br>so deaths and this is really what<br>happens in a lot of neurological<br>conditions so a lot of our neurons<br>should last our whole lifetime if they<br>die prematurely that's not what we want<br>to occur so this regulation of cells of<br>survival as a crit was critical and so a<br>pitocin source ODS it's not just about<br>protecting us from disease it's also a<br>critical process for development some of<br>the things that are I guess if you<br>disrupt this process and mice some of<br>the things that you see you see this<br>webbing rather than nice little digits<br>and for the sculpting of organs so it's<br>really a critical process occurs every<br>day and in each of us billions of cells<br>are dying each day by a pitocin and this<br>is really a highly controlled process<br>and we know a lot about this process<br>has sydney brenner bob horvitz and john<br>sulston received the Nobel Prize in 2002<br>for their discoveries concerning the<br>genetic regulation of organ development<br>and programmed cell death so really<br>their work laid the foundation for our<br>understanding about how cells die and we<br>can represent a lot of what they know<br>what what they discovered here and<br>really this is also a fabulous example<br>of the but then I guess the beauty of<br>basic biology so by studying the little<br>worm this little flat worm C elegans<br>they were able so sydney brenner really<br>established this worm or his laboratory<br>as a as a model organism and then john<br>sulston he met the fate of every cell<br>and kind of remarkably he showed that<br>cells don't just die randomly it's<br>really a very controlled process and<br>therefore because it's a committee it<br>was a controlled process he was then<br>able to figure out and identify specific<br>molecules which controlled this process<br>and so then these molecules were cloned<br>and bob horvitz as lab at MIT and so we<br>have these different proteins and I'm<br>going to use the same color code<br>throughout so we have a these proteins<br>here Eagle one which inhibits so these<br>arrows were these not arrows these<br>connections like this indicate<br>inhibition and then these when I use an<br>arrow that indicates activation so<br>actually in a healthy cell normally this<br>protein is dominant and it inhibits so<br>death by inhibiting this protein once we<br>get this guy we get two inhibitors over<br>the inhibitor and so you activate cell<br>death so I'm afraid that's it's somewhat<br>complicated but I'll try and keep it<br>simple<br>anyway so the more as simple as I can so<br>the other remarkable thing is that this<br>process and worms there's actually very<br>conserved in us and we have got homologs<br>of of these arms same proteins and in<br>fact if you take the human protein and<br>put it into a worm where this protein<br>has been knocked out it complements so<br>the function of these proteins is<br>remarkably conserved<br>and in humans this homologue is called<br>bcl-2 or b-cell lymphoma protein 2 and<br>so this was first identified as a a<br>translocation breakpoint so as a genetic<br>change which is found in b-cell<br>lymphomas and this really then laid the<br>connection between a potosí and its<br>importance as a effectively a hallmark<br>of cancer and so if we go to the next<br>thing when we think of the hallmarks of<br>cancer this is a very classic paper from<br>in 2000 and there's been an update but<br>really that remains a sort of a landmark<br>in the field and one of the hallmarks of<br>tumor formation is this resistance to<br>cell death so the cells which should<br>normally die don't die and so this I<br>guess a number of connections led to<br>this and this really really then<br>identified and there's been a huge<br>effort to develop small molecule<br>compounds or what we would be commonly<br>implemented as drugs which can<br>manipulate this process and trigger cell<br>death because the desire is to trigger<br>cell death and the tumor cells so that<br>we can eradicate these cells so what<br>have I done so really I'm going to tell<br>to short stories and what I'm going to<br>focus on is really kind of the menu<br>night menu Tay because that's actually<br>what I do I'm afraid it's looking it's<br>picking a target protein and then<br>figuring out how these proteins interact<br>and how then we can modulate and develop<br>small molecule compounds which will<br>affect the activity remembering that<br>we've got our self full of sea full of<br>molecules and we've got to develops the<br>compounds which will specifically bind<br>to the right protein and modulate the<br>function of that and then if we can<br>develop these compounds then maybe they<br>can be turned into therapeutics and then<br>in the second story I really talked a<br>little bit about a compound where we've<br>learned a lot about the function of the<br>pro<br>really it this caught the second story<br>the compound has got is in the clinical<br>trials at the moment<br>but it's also told us a lot about<br>biology and so sometimes these are<br>iterative processes you shouldn't just<br>think of them as an endpoint that you're<br>going after a drag because many failed<br>drugs are very good agents for<br>manipulating signaling pathways okay so<br>we're going to focus in on this pathway<br>which I've shown you already and we're<br>going to look at these proteins up here<br>so we're going to look at our friends<br>the bcl-2 proteins these are pro<br>survival proteins and then what we're<br>going to refer to as the bh3 only or you<br>can think of them as the yellow death<br>proteins and so these are these proteins<br>in C elegans there's just one so we've<br>got the simple interaction that's a<br>one-to-one correspondence in humans we<br>have or in all mammals we've got<br>homologs and so we've got families of<br>proteins which serve similar functions<br>and really there's been a lot because we<br>know that these proteins can inactivate<br>these proteins this interaction was<br>really a major focus because it was<br>thought that we could develop compounds<br>which would inhibit by mimicking the<br>activity of these proteins we could take<br>these guys out and this would allow us<br>to develop improve therapeutics and I<br>think really this this holds true and<br>there are a number of companies that<br>have exactly these mimetic compounds and<br>clinical trials so I'm going to sort of<br>take us through a couple of the things<br>that we have done which have helped with<br>this just along the way okay so I'm a<br>protein biochemist so that means that we<br>look at proteins and these I have going<br>to talk about two different kinds of<br>ways that structures can be solved and<br>most of these be co2 structures that we<br>solve was solved actually by NMR and<br>this was all done in collaboration with<br>people in Melbourne and actually using<br>the bio 21 facility there to collect all<br>of our inner mar data and really this is<br>a kind of a complicated jigsaw as how<br>you can say<br>of solving a structure and so you<br>collect a lot of dots and then these<br>dots tell us about which atoms are in<br>close proximity and then really by<br>spending months at the computer you get<br>a big list of these dots and then you<br>can turn them into a structure one day<br>so it's a lot of kind of jigsaw building<br>and so some of these structures as one<br>actually was a relatively<br>straightforward one but some of them<br>took really six to eight months to solve<br>so going from here to here is not a<br>trivial process but really what does it<br>tell us<br>well the key thing that these structures<br>told us by looking at different members<br>of this family so we're looking at our<br>pro-survival blue guys is that the<br>conserved residues so these proteins<br>have three groups of residues which<br>identify them as being a member of that<br>family and they actually come together<br>in space so although they're distant in<br>sequence they once the protein is all<br>folded up they come together and we can<br>see them here associating and we'll come<br>back to these in a moment so we also<br>looked at these bh3 only so our death<br>our yellow death guys so these ones in<br>fact we couldn't get a pretty picture<br>like which I've just shown you these<br>proteins are actually unstructured in<br>solution and this was really one of the<br>first classes of proteins that was quite<br>well steadily as being an intrinsically<br>disordered and so this is a CDS spectrum<br>and for most of us it doesn't matter too<br>much but the key thing is that these can<br>are really the kind of the spaghetti<br>proteins they're not well defined they<br>don't make one of these pretty<br>structures but then what we did is we<br>solved a number of different complex<br>structures and when I say we most of<br>this actually the structural work that<br>I'm showing here is was done by Mark<br>Hines and I together and this is one<br>where we the first turnaround was the<br>protein on its own and then it binds to<br>this yellow one so this is our yellow<br>death protein which is coming from here<br>and so on its own it's a piece of<br>spaghetti and we could destroy it as a<br>squiggly sort of 12 and then upon<br>binding it becomes ordered and it adopts<br>a very discrete structure<br>and all of these bh3 only proteins the<br>region that binds adopts exactly the<br>same structure at least when looking at<br>it that this level likewise all of our<br>pro survival proteins our blue ones now<br>all of these family members have been<br>solved and they also at this kind of<br>topographical view have the same<br>structure and so this told us a lot<br>about the conformational changes we also<br>solved another structure and this is<br>another pro-survival 1b CLW and then<br>this is the most complete this was the<br>full-length protein we solved the rest<br>of them actually had their type C<br>terminal tail missing and these tail<br>residues for this can sort of be the<br>tail of the dog lying down here it's<br>actually lies in the position where our<br>yellow protein binds so if you look here<br>we've got our green pink and yellow and<br>we actually showed that this tail<br>modulates the ability of proteins to<br>interact with this conserved hydrophobic<br>groove so we can kind of bring this all<br>together and if you've the last bits<br>have kind of been leaving you cold well<br>maybe a few this is kind of a summary of<br>what we've just seen so we've got our<br>spaghetti protein we've got our pro<br>survival protein which really keeps its<br>binding groove kind of occluded which<br>makes sense if it wants to prevent not<br>non-specifically bind to proteins and<br>then when they come together you get<br>this complex and so at the same time<br>these proteins are tend to insert into<br>the membrane and so we get this complex<br>forming so how are we going to develop a<br>drug what have we done to help think<br>about making a therapeutic compound well<br>in parallel with these experiments we<br>started to wonder if some of the family<br>members were slightly different and in<br>fact together with David weighing at the<br>Walter and Eliza hall we my group<br>purified all these proteins and then we<br>use them to just do a very detailed<br>analysis of the binding properties and<br>what we showed is<br>that these are our five pro survival<br>proteins and our eight yellow pro-death<br>ones and the height of this bar<br>indicates binding affinity so how<br>tightly do they interact and we can see<br>this is a log scale up here in fact so<br>there really are big differences in our<br>binding affinity but if we look at our<br>red ones it actually binds tightly to<br>all of them so the bars are about the<br>same height but some of them didn't bind<br>equally and we can see this here for<br>example knock sir only binds to these<br>two proteins a 1 and MCL 1 and contrast<br>this one bad these have terrible names<br>but so this is kind of a good protein<br>but it's got a name bad it's but it only<br>binds to these guys so these proteins<br>don't behave exactly the same so they<br>actually have selective binding and so<br>why do we care this paper which has<br>actually been cited over 800 times so<br>really a highly cited paper and so why<br>is that so actually it's because the<br>selective binding matters for killing so<br>if you want to kill a cell you have to<br>take out all of the pro survival<br>proteins not just one and so if you made<br>a bad mom attic that could be a good<br>mimetic butter and if it's mimicking the<br>action of this protein sorry then then<br>and if the cell has these other proteins<br>present it won't kill it and so this is<br>really critical if you're going to make<br>mimetic protein compounds that mimic the<br>action of these they've really got to<br>take out all of the pro survival so we<br>tried to understand so we also did some<br>so this is the work of Kalyn Smits my<br>first PhD student he did a huge amount<br>of work in my lab and I should say these<br>were some of the first structures I<br>think solved wasn't from the synchrotron<br>in Australia and no tygo and so he sold<br>four different structures so these are<br>complexes of these guys and what we were<br>looking for is looking for differences<br>in affinity so this is actually one<br>that's relatively weak these so these<br>are two abrading the<br>two hundred fold difference in affinity<br>at this level they look the same so it's<br>not until you start really looking<br>drilling down and looking at the really<br>the detailed context as to what might<br>differ and we can see in this one that<br>this interaction so these these other<br>three which bind tightly all have the<br>set of dots across here and so these<br>ones are missing and so it's these kinds<br>of differences which underpin the<br>selective binding and give rise to<br>differences in affinity and we can so in<br>parallel with these experiments so we<br>high has a high-throughput screening<br>facility which I think some of you will<br>have heard about before and we use some<br>of our recombinant proteins and the high<br>throughput screen so we put them through<br>this high put through throughput screen<br>where we're searching for small molecule<br>compounds which would bind tightly and<br>then these might be lead compounds for<br>further development as drugs and so we<br>were doing these experiments and we came<br>up with some compounds that were binding<br>but then really in 2005 there was a<br>beautiful paper from Abbott Laboratories<br>and so there's a they came up with this<br>compound which is now I guess one of the<br>leading compounds of this class referred<br>to as Abbott 7:37 and so this compound<br>has many other features of what you<br>would want in a mimetic of these yellow<br>so we're wanting to mimic the action of<br>these yellow proteins with a small<br>molecule compound which has features<br>which might be able to be delivered as a<br>drug so you might say why don't just<br>deliver this protein itself but if you<br>gave someone a protein they would<br>actually think it was food and they<br>probably chomp it up and use it as<br>energy that would be the that's often<br>the response to to giving people protein<br>so they're not always good at good<br>therapeutic so if we can the goal is<br>then to come up with these small<br>molecule compounds so Abbott came up<br>with this compound which looked very<br>good and that was it led to regression<br>of solid tumors and then they were also<br>able to show in preclinical day<br>that was well tolerated and I guess if a<br>cases and treatment of certain tumors<br>and so so so what came from this so<br>really then the analysis of this<br>compound which is advancing through<br>clinical trials was significantly aided<br>by our knowledge about selective binding<br>because it turns out that abt seven<br>three seven there's a mimic of this<br>protein bad so actually it doesn't bind<br>to MCO one it doesn't bind to a-1 this<br>means it doesn't work in tumors that<br>have got these proteins present and so<br>then the knowledge about our binding<br>profile was really has been really<br>significant and advancing that compound<br>through because if we hadn't have known<br>this that that's how it worked then<br>actually the compound would look much<br>worse because unless you can type the<br>tuners and find the right tumors that<br>you can then analyze the compounds in<br>things will look like they're failing<br>but it's R it's really a matter and I<br>guess it's kind of this kind of analysis<br>is what you can think of as some of this<br>personalized medicine which one day we<br>all hope we will will be developed and<br>help us before we need it and so this<br>compound then is being used as an<br>finical trials but they must type the<br>tumors to make sure that they haven't<br>got MCL one this is one of the early<br>experiments this was work with that<br>David Wang published and we can see here<br>this is looking at look mice mice with<br>lymphoma and we can see this is a tumor<br>which is expressing mcl one these mice<br>died quite readily it soon after twenty<br>days whereas when you treat the control<br>or what the same tumor which has been<br>engineered to express bcl-2 then this is<br>then a this tumor is killed and they<br>they must respond to the therapeutic so<br>this is really quite a promising Avenue<br>for the development and I think that<br>there will be these will advance through<br>to the clinic or at least analogs of<br>them<br>so just to recap this story in a normal<br>what what it needs to happen so and<br>there is in a normal cell we get lots of<br>stresses and the typical stress that on<br>a cell causes a signalling pathway which<br>leads to our yellow protein so it which<br>says okay there's trouble in this cell<br>we need to die so this yellow protein<br>gets made that then binds to our blue<br>protein and signals a pitocin and death<br>so that's what we want to happen when a<br>cell becomes damaged for example if we<br>get sunburned we want our sunburned<br>cells to go away we don't so or but in a<br>tumor cell what the common thing that<br>happened is we've got disruption of the<br>signaling pathways so rather than<br>responding appropriately there's a<br>blockade and so although there's a<br>stress and the stress mate might be<br>perceived you don't get there's there's<br>no ability to to increase the expression<br>or make the yellow protein available and<br>so these cells can then survive and then<br>this might then go on to replicate and<br>give rise to a tumor whereas if we can<br>give our BH 3 compounds so if we've got<br>our mutant signaling pathway then we can<br>then come in with this compound kind of<br>down right at the end and it's very<br>these compounds of being one of the<br>things that's just looking quite<br>promising as as as as a cut to Co<br>administer with chemotherapy and<br>radiotherapy because a lot of those<br>standard treatments you create a stress<br>but if the signaling pathway is broken<br>there's no there's nothing nothing cell<br>can't do anything it can register the<br>stress but it can't go on to connect and<br>say okay we need to die so this thean if<br>we can make this mimetic compound which<br>which is now we can things are looking<br>more promising so i think whether these<br>compounds that are in the trials now<br>progress or whether all there'll be<br>different iterations of them time will<br>tell but they at least look quite<br>promising okay so i want to thank a<br>number of people for the story so<br>particular mark Hines and David Wang at<br>the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute they<br>were so I've worked with my<br>for a long time before and after that<br>project and David but particularly for<br>about the five or six years when we did<br>this work now both excellent<br>collaborators okay so the other thing<br>I'll just take a small break before we<br>do a shorter story so don't worry I just<br>want to also think make a few comments<br>about equipment so when I came to ou<br>Tago there was relatively a small amount<br>of equipment for doing protein research<br>and I really think that the investment<br>and equipment has made a huge difference<br>so we have these boxes and I think I've<br>heard Peter Crampton refer to biochemist<br>trees boxes this is at 1 million dollar<br>box so these are valuable and important<br>boxes for research so that was funded by<br>the like a mass spectrometer that was<br>funded by the large equipment fund we<br>have our x-ray facility which was<br>particularly strengthened by the arrival<br>of Curt Krause and then has been a major<br>resource for a number of other people<br>and we have other pieces of equipment<br>which have been funded by the school and<br>the division and these have all been<br>made a significant contribution and now<br>I think our biochemistry is really a<br>good place to do protein research and so<br>there's a also a number of people that<br>lead groups which utilize this resource<br>so John Kat field Sigurd and Torsten and<br>really I think John and when I first<br>came we had to travel when I know that<br>John and Sue and the early for a number<br>of years had to travel enormously and it<br>really being able to do things here mace<br>made a huge difference so I think the<br>investment and equipment has really<br>allowed a lot of what we do okay so now<br>we just want a short story to finish was<br>because we'll be running out of puff so<br>this is really where I want to talk more<br>about a small molecule compound which<br>manipulate which is also being in the<br>clinic for the duck treatment of cancer<br>but it's really also told us a lot about<br>how the protein works and then really<br>sort of identified other avenues for<br>treatment or development of compounds so<br>we come back to our pathway that I've<br>talked about and we've been focusing up<br>here now I'm going to talk about these<br>green guys down here so these are called<br>ia Peas so I hope is our inhibitors of a<br>pitocin they bind and inhibit caspases<br>and in that very early clip that I<br>showed you of proteins running around<br>munching things up the proteins that<br>we're doing the munching where our<br>caspases so their job on the cell once<br>the paper ptosis has been activated is<br>to get about and destroy things and so<br>you really don't want to let those guys<br>loose unless you really want to die so<br>this is really the safety catch so these<br>bind and inhibit them caspases and<br>really prevent latent level or<br>nonspecific activation and then I'm<br>afraid these inhibitors are regulated by<br>some more inhibitors and so as we saw<br>before we've got kind of this complex<br>pathway so these are our ia Peas and<br>they fitting in here and I'll come back<br>to this slide and thinking about how<br>they work but what have I got next okay<br>so this is a collaboration with David vu<br>and John silk and I really have to thank<br>David vu enormously when I came back to<br>New Zealand in 1997 somehow I had an<br>email from him early on within the first<br>week or two and so really then that's<br>when I started working on I ABS and I<br>have worked on them on and off ever<br>since and then he also really all of the<br>weihai collaborations have come been I<br>guess helped by David vu and he's a<br>great person then you can all I can<br>always ring him up and he'll give you at<br>least blunt advice it's not what sage<br>advice and he's now the deputy director<br>of the welfare and Eliza Hall Institute<br>so he's he's very good okay so I a peas<br>the IEP is that I care about<br>multi-domain proteins that look like<br>this so they have these a bunch of<br>domains and so this means in fact and<br>they have been relatively tricky to<br>study and so we've had to focus on<br>different domains and in the early days<br>I focused on these domains here<br>baculovirus I ap repeat so not an easy<br>name but<br>this is the defining domain of this<br>family and the name tells us quite a bit<br>these domains were actually first found<br>in Bakula viruses so again we start with<br>basic biology and that then has come to<br>sort of have important ramifications for<br>how we might treat human disease so<br>these this is actually baculovirus is<br>infecting an insect cell and that's<br>where they were first found and then<br>subsequently David Vosges group as well<br>as Dave gardels group and Genentech<br>found the mammalian hominid switch I'm<br>showing here so they all all I AP<br>proteins have a bir domain and we mark<br>Heinz and I solved the first structure<br>of a BIR de man back in 1999 and so<br>fairly harmless looking domain it's got<br>a little zinc ion here and then it's a<br>hundred amino acids fairly and at the<br>time we didn't know a lot about how it<br>worked that really we didn't do a lot<br>more on it for a number of years but<br>lots of other group has figured some<br>really important things out and it<br>really but<br>so our bir domain here became quite an<br>important drug target what we have here<br>is i'm it's just showing IA PS but we<br>can think at this point of the bir<br>domain as representing the IA p and this<br>binds to a protein called smack and the<br>region of smack that binds that's<br>important for the action is just 5 amino<br>acids and this complex is shown here so<br>when this protein smack binds here this<br>thin means that IA PS can no longer<br>inhibit caspases<br>and so you activate the caspases and you<br>signal a photo psious so that's a good<br>thing if you want to kill a tumor cell<br>so this meant that it was really a<br>beautiful target for drug discovery and<br>lots of companies so there's a whole<br>list of companies that have IA p<br>antagonists about six or seven and so<br>this is a small molecule compound so<br>this is a little chemicals that we might<br>be able to use as a drag binds in<br>exactly the same spot here so when this<br>chemical binds the idea was that then<br>you would block this<br>here and so then you would get an active<br>care space that could go around and eat<br>up the cell so that was all very good<br>and then this is a figure from a paper<br>of John silk and David Bo's and this is<br>really a landmark paper in the field<br>because the compounds do something<br>really remarkable<br>they bind here and they were expected<br>just to activate caspases by relieving<br>the inhibitor but in fact what they do<br>is they destroy I a piece so if we look<br>here at a this is showing from extract<br>and we we look at this I ever themselves<br>and then five minutes after adding so<br>the people we work with at tetra logics<br>then they're good compound we call<br>compound a so it's it's the good one and<br>after five minutes you can see that<br>remarkably this protein is gone<br>completely wiped out so what this means<br>is this the compound binds here and<br>we've got structures and we know how it<br>binds but it does something completely<br>different because just binding here<br>really wouldn't expect it to destroy the<br>protein so this really brings us to<br>focus on the ring domain and this has<br>really been a discovery over the last<br>five years to try and figure out how<br>binding here in fact activates the ring<br>domain the loss of protein so this rapid<br>loss means we have to think about<br>ubiquitin so ubiquitin is a marvelous<br>protein if you want to destroy things so<br>it's a very small protein that can be<br>attached to other proteins and when it's<br>attached to them it says that they have<br>to be sent to the rubbish so if we've<br>got our green protein we stick a few you<br>backward ins on it and then uh-oh off we<br>go and to get recycled and so I guess<br>that's it's the environmentally friendly<br>protein or process and so we keep our<br>ubiquitin and we get to reuse it but<br>that's the process which is resulting in<br>the loss of that band so you go from<br>having that band to its loss because<br>we've sent it off to get recycled and we<br>know a lot about this process by some<br>very it's a really beautiful work of our<br>injection over air from<br>Irwin Rose who really over a long period<br>of time these to this he was the PhD<br>Aaron was ever impeach D student and<br>they cease these two still go to many of<br>the ubiquitin meetings and they're very<br>helpful people but they worked at the<br>Technion Institute in Israel and they<br>used to go every summer to Irwin roses<br>group in the US and did their pioneering<br>experiments effectively over a number of<br>summers so pretty impressive and they<br>really discovered you but couldn't<br>mediated protein degradation and so it's<br>a really complicated process I'm afraid<br>and so we really don't want to getting<br>too late to think about that but we've<br>got a number of proteins and really our<br>ia peas because they've got those red<br>domain means that they fit in here at<br>this slot and there are actually 500 of<br>these proteins and we really know very<br>little about any of them so lots of<br>these proteins you Bick would and has<br>really only it's really not a well<br>studied thing and so I think this well<br>this is a area where lots of things can<br>be discovered in that in the future but<br>this presence of this domain tells us<br>that it belongs in this slot as an e3 so<br>that means it can stick ubiquitin onto<br>itself or onto targets and so all of<br>these other 500a threes will have<br>specific targets that they're going to<br>send to the recycling bin so when<br>they're working they're going to cause<br>these proteins to go and get recycled<br>so we were interested in the ring domain<br>and we could cause this degree we solved<br>the structure of it we sewed it some<br>showed it was a dimer and then we'll<br>just go reasonably quickly now we then<br>could show that dimerization is<br>important for activity so when you stick<br>your BIC whatand on in a Cell you send<br>it to the recycling bin and it vanishes<br>if you do this in a test tube in my lab<br>you'll make a letter and if you run it<br>on a gel so this is really our protein<br>with ubiquity and stuck on it we can see<br>that it needs to be a dimer monomers<br>don't really would do the business so<br>dimerization is important we then showed<br>that dimerization could is regulated and<br>some work with Pascale Meyer and London<br>large<br>we could see that the other domains so<br>if you just take the ring domain it's<br>always a dimer if you take the<br>full-length protein we could show that<br>this is regulated and that the in<br>terminal domains modulate dimerization<br>and this time the presence of the dimer<br>correlated with activity sorry so when<br>we've got a dimer we get a much bigger<br>smear than if we've got a wild-type<br>protein which is forming a little dimer<br>okay so in in a healthy cell I guess<br>this is normally a monomer and these<br>domains interact and this prevents<br>activity if we make it into a dimer we<br>know that then it can interact with the<br>ubiquitin machinery and start sticking<br>ubiquitin on so now if we come back to<br>our compound how might this be<br>regulating this pathway so it's really<br>quite I guess it's pretty cool and so<br>what we figured out is that these<br>compounds so this is our magic compound<br>a so this is really a good compound it's<br>in clinical trials and looking pretty<br>good so when we add this compound we can<br>activate our protein to make a much<br>bigger smear so in this isn't a test<br>tube we see it as smear but if you add<br>it to a cell you knock out that protein<br>so we see the loss of our band and this<br>correlates exactly without forming a<br>diamond and so compounds that activate<br>this promote dimerization and so I guess<br>I've gone through that quite quickly but<br>if we just take a few seconds I'll move<br>a little bit of time on this slide it<br>really summarizes how these compounds<br>work so these compounds can bind to the<br>bir domain and this is they were really<br>meant to do something very simple just<br>to knock off a caspase and activate it<br>and that's not what it does it does<br>something much more complicated and<br>perhaps much more interesting so you<br>when the compound binds it triggers this<br>protein so our red domains now interact<br>and form a dimer this means we can<br>interact with the ubiquitin machinery<br>which means we can put ubiquitin on we<br>can then send it to the recycling bin<br>and then this is why we're going to have<br>this loss of this protein and it's this<br>loss of this band which is what you're<br>looking for if you want to kill a cell<br>because these proteins are potent<br>survival molecules and these are I guess<br>are looking these are at least a very<br>promising Avenue and so just to come<br>back now to to finish really what I've<br>talked about today is two short stories<br>that kind of connect together on this<br>episodic pathway and so the first story<br>we talked about was developing mimics of<br>this company's molecules so that we can<br>activate or inactivate our pro-survival<br>and promote death by that way and in the<br>second class of compounds are aap<br>antagonists take these guys out of<br>action<br>so you activate caspases actually it<br>turns out and I've tried to keep it<br>simple for tonight the primarily we're<br>actually knocking out these ia P's up<br>here and we lead to a whole new cascade<br>we activate transcription factors and if<br>kappa b and it has a really a dramatic<br>effect on the cells signaling so we've<br>learned a lot about cell signaling from<br>the study and so i guess i can cover<br>that but not only are the small<br>molecules leading to therapeutics but<br>they're really telling us a lot about<br>the cell and i think that's really what<br>you want to be doing because lots of<br>small molecules can fail so hopefully if<br>you can utilize that knowledge and not<br>just go after a drag okay so really the<br>goal of a lot of this work is really to<br>try and take out this resisting so death<br>so that you can therefore kill the tumor<br>cells and then this I guess this is the<br>goal of many many groups around the<br>world and the story that I've told I<br>hope this gives an idea about what a<br>relatively small group can do but you<br>can make I hope think we've made quite a<br>contribution to our thinking about the<br>development of these compounds and how<br>to I guess manipulate ourselves and nine<br>pathways so these people here all need a<br>lot of things because they have all<br>remained good friends throughout my<br>career and I've keep in touch with these<br>people often and I yes so they have I<br>think I've mentioned their contributions<br>already I also want to thank<br>particularly Warren so I came to Otago<br>and when Warren was head of department<br>and he was um he was an enthusiastic<br>supporter and helped with many um things<br>in terms of writing grants and getting<br>money for equipment and again John was<br>helpful in establishing and I think we<br>owe John a lot for helping to set up<br>protein research in Otago and then Oh in<br>the last few years as Helen has noted<br>I've worked done some worked as the<br>associate dean of research and she's<br>been very supportive now I really need<br>to take and so I decided not to put<br>pictures of people throughout the slides<br>because I thought that then that's only<br>representing the people that I've talked<br>about and really their work which is<br>just a snippet and there are a lot of<br>other people involved a lot of the<br>people who were previously in my group<br>are showing here and I want to<br>particularly poke out Peter mace and<br>calamus Mitch who made a huge<br>contribution to the program the projects<br>that I've shown but a number of other<br>people here and a lot of the early work<br>was particularly involved a number of<br>excellent technicians and raylene<br>Frederick short penny Harris and<br>Gretchen ski were also all technicians<br>and then Bodhi bitumen a more recent<br>technician who just left to be a<br>winemaker unless so he's gone to the<br>good life so we I really want to SEC the<br>contribution and really my lab is mostly<br>being quite a small lab and these are<br>the current people in my group and<br>actually I haven't shown any of their<br>work we mostly work on ubiquitin related<br>processes and I think there are a lot of<br>exciting proteins so we're we're really<br>enthusiastic to understand the process<br>and there are actually very few drugs<br>that manipulate that and be a bit quit<br>and pathway and so I think there's a lot<br>of opportunity there in the long term<br>and this is my lab from a couple of<br>years ago and many of these people are<br>still in my lab and so there<br>a really good group of people to work<br>with and I think I've mentioned that a<br>couple of these people but Calum and<br>Peter really made a huge contribution to<br>this work and then I wanted this to talk<br>about Joe just for a moment she was<br>she's now in Australia she was a very<br>good PhD student and she worked on a<br>project and it was really in many ways<br>the same but in that we were doing a<br>very careful analysis of a protein but<br>in this case we proved that the<br>literature was all wrong and so her work<br>led to a retraction of an article from<br>nature and things so this was it showed<br>that the perseverance or the value of<br>persevering and so yeah so this is she's<br>made a did a great lot of work but um in<br>this case it was a slightly different<br>outcome so lastly I really have to thank<br>the Marston Fund they've funded meet<br>consistently since 1997 when I first<br>wrote a Marsden grant it was I think in<br>days when life was easier and I was very<br>naive I never I got the referees reports<br>and I thought I am those comments affair<br>and I never wrote the rebuttal because I<br>thought that the comments were good they<br>were reasonable and so I knit and that<br>but they still funded me and so I think<br>and then they have really been a<br>fantastic support of my group I've had<br>HRC funding which I have at the moment<br>oncology trust lottery grants board and<br>in the university and numerous ways that<br>has supported arm through specific<br>grants and then equipment and Health<br>Sciences postdoc fellowship which was<br>what supported part of Peter maces as a<br>postdoc so thank you and then I just<br>wanted to thank my family and so nobody<br>wanted well Richard didn't want a big<br>picture so we went with this picture as<br>a representative he thought that you<br>couldn't pick out anybody from looking<br>at this so I wondered I guess to thank<br>Richard for all of his support and then<br>my whole family for various aspects and<br>helping in all kinds of ways and thank<br>you again and hopefully I haven't gone<br>Catherine thank you very much for that<br>outstanding lecture very very much my<br>name is Kurt Kraus I'm the current head<br>of Department of Biochemistry and it's<br>my privilege to say just a few words<br>about your your lecture I can't add<br>anything to it scientifically because it<br>was such an excellent excellent job but<br>I thought in so many ways that the the<br>lecture and that your your career really<br>typifies outstanding science and I<br>thought it would be good to review some<br>of the aspects of that and particularly<br>for some of the young scientists in the<br>audience who are wanting to construct a<br>career as kind of a guideline about how<br>to go about doing it because I think<br>you've done it and continue to do it so<br>incredibly well the first key aspect is<br>that you chose a very very important<br>project my PhD advisor you always talk<br>about choosing a project that you could<br>chew on over and over for many many<br>years and I think you chose an important<br>project on two different levels one is<br>on the very basic science level where<br>all the proteins are moving around<br>inside the cell and how these proteins<br>interact and how they find their<br>partners in order to tell the cell ok<br>you need to die you need to live and and<br>that molecular Val egg if you will is<br>incredibly neat from a basic science<br>point of view but the the area that you<br>chose to focus on is also incredibly<br>important in terms of translation<br>because it underpins treatments for<br>cancer so it's important in a basic<br>science level and it's important on a<br>translational level and it's something<br>that can be worked on for many many<br>years<br>second key thing I think you've done is<br>you've consistently chosen outstanding<br>collaborators and these are people who<br>are on the cutting edge of science who<br>are moving science ahead and you<br>mastered the literature in the field and<br>and mastered the knowledge and worked<br>with these people and continued to<br>produce outstanding work year after year<br>after year the third thing is you're<br>trained as a structural biologist or<br>approaching crystallography but you<br>moved over to the dark side and did in<br>an NMR structures right and I think that<br>that the hallmark of that is you were<br>pursuing a scientific problem<br>you weren't pursuing a technique and<br>it's easy as<br>scientists to fall in love with whatever<br>technique that you're using at that<br>given moment but in fact what we really<br>want to do is to find an answer to a<br>problem and and to use whatever<br>techniques<br>it takes to find the answer to that<br>problem if it's in mr or crystallography<br>or our genetics or what-have-you<br>the fourth aspect of your career that I<br>think is really really remarkable and<br>you mentioned it yourself and that is<br>perseverance and perseverance is so<br>important because science is a hard<br>Yakka 90% of whatever we do fails and it<br>fails again and again and again and you<br>have to stick with it if you're ever<br>going to succeed and you you've the<br>finding out that the ring domains were<br>dimers in order to be active took<br>perseverance and and incredible strength<br>to in order to put to report that and<br>it's ended up changing the field then<br>the fifth aspect is particularly<br>important I think in a time where people<br>worry about how to fund science and<br>should you find translational science in<br>other words science directly reporting<br>it you know to a clinical result or an<br>agricultural result or should you fund<br>basic science which is looking at a<br>basic problem you can see that as you've<br>worked in this field over time the<br>translational or the clinical compounds<br>have come that wasn't the initial that<br>may have been the initial goal but that<br>wasn't what you're initially working on<br>but now catherine has collaborations<br>with pharmaceutical companies around the<br>world and they're coming to her to test<br>these compounds and it's really usually<br>illustrative about how if you choose an<br>important problem in science that has<br>clinical ramifications those will come<br>eventually but it's very very difficult<br>to fund that at the beginning so by<br>funding basic science you end up getting<br>things that help all of us but a little<br>bit down the road as opposed to right<br>away so I wanted to end by saying thank<br>you very much for this brilliant example<br>of outstanding science we're very<br>grateful we're grateful to have you in<br>biochemistry we're grateful to have you<br>at the University of Otago and we look<br>forward to continued discoveries from<br>your lab from<br>years to come and I have a small token<br>to commemorate your inaugural<br>professorial lectureship that I'd like<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
