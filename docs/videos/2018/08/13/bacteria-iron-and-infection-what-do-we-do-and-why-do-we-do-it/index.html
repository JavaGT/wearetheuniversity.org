automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>welcome everybody to this inaugural<br>proper selection when we think of the<br>school we when we think about what it<br>means to us and me the most important<br>thing part of the school<br>it obviously is our staff and it's<br>always good to be able to recognize our<br>excellent staff and particularly those<br>staff who have being promoted within the<br>university and so it's a great pleasure<br>to be able to welcome you all here to in<br>Lamont's inaugural lecture and it's also<br>a pleasure to welcome Ian Stanley here<br>to come and join us for this very<br>special occasion and so he let further<br>ado I'd like to introduce the brass head<br>of Department of Biochemistry who is<br>it's my great pleasure of course to<br>speak to the introduce on his<br>communication of this photographer<br>pistoia lectureship I thought I'd<br>started and just say a couple words<br>about his academic history a little bit<br>about the kind of research he does a<br>little bit about some distinctions even<br>received a BSC honours in 1980 from<br>University of Edinburgh and then<br>following that he matriculated at<br>University of Oxford and he received his<br>DPhil at Oxford in 1983 after finishing<br>at Oxford in 1983 he received a national<br>research fellowship that he took up at<br>the University of Adelaide and he was at<br>the University of Adelaide for the next<br>three years he moved in in 1987 to join<br>the Department of Chemistry biochemistry<br>at the University of Otago as a lecturer<br>and then he worked his way steadily up<br>the race until in 2003 when he became an<br>associate professor and then this year<br>he received the rank of professorship<br>Ian's main interest has been in<br>infectious diseases and his work has<br>focused predominantly other not<br>exclusively on Pseudomonas which is a<br>very very important cause of disease and<br>it's a tenacious ubiquitous difficult to<br>eradicate organism that I know from my<br>clinical work is one of the toughest<br>challenges that we face in in clinical<br>medicine and he's focused on some<br>specific aspects of it of this organism<br>that he'll share with us tonight but<br>most specifically its use of iron its<br>development to sense and acquire iron<br>and it's a signaling mechanism by which<br>Mountain official mechanism to claim<br>iron from the environment iines had a<br>number of distinctions in his career<br>which I was just a few<br>he's the New Zealand microbiological<br>society and distinguished speaker this<br>year at an upcoming meeting he's<br>received the New Zealand Society of our<br>chemistry and molecular biology award<br>for research excellence he was a<br>Commonwealth medical fellow he's a past<br>president of the New Zealand<br>microbiological Society he's been active<br>in a number of service positions at the<br>University for example the University of<br>Otago he's been the chair of the ibs-d<br>since 2003 and he's the newly appointed<br>successor to take over the genetics<br>teaching program beginning next year I<br>think to me it's been an inspiring<br>scientist and a compelling teacher and a<br>wonderful colleague so it's my great<br>pleasure to introduce him to speak about<br>okay I thank you very much curtain Hill<br>and for the kind words in the<br>introduction and thank you everyone for<br>coming along and I'm looking forward to<br>telling you a bit about what we do this<br>will let me but also I'd like to take<br>the opportunity to tell you a little bit<br>about why work in this particular<br>subject I think in all the time that<br>I've been at Otago<br>nobody has ever asked me what do we work<br>on what we do so I thought I'd tell you<br>so hence the title of a talk bacteria<br>are an infection what do we do and why<br>do we do it and but why do we do it will<br>be stems from a sort of series of<br>historical events so I'll probably go<br>through that first two line combats that<br>what do we do as that becomes as things<br>move on okay so first of all you can say<br>why do biochemist there's lots of things<br>and things to do with life<br>why would I study biochemistry it really<br>stems from when I went to high school<br>and Kurt didn't mention why I went to<br>high school and Andrews in Scotland many<br>years ago now but I don't think the<br>school have changed very much this is<br>our school which is very authorized<br>there and even older now the actual<br>classrooms behind this the<br>administration block in front of the<br>school is a big one this view looking<br>the other way where you see this big old<br>building it's not a part of the school<br>but there's actually a monastery from it<br>was built in about 1100 what time we got<br>there it's a ruin but with hindsight<br>it's quite cool having a nine hundred<br>year old building in front of your<br>school I don't think as many like this<br>in New Zealand but it's got nothing to<br>do with biochemistry so I better move on<br>so what I like it's good I like<br>chemistry and the computer has converted<br>my tick into a square root but chemistry<br>was good<br>I like biology so I enjoyed those all<br>the timeit's is gone there in the last<br>year I suddenly discovered that<br>chemistry and biology could connect so<br>our biology teacher got a bit venturous<br>and told about this wonderful thing<br>called biochemistry and he told me that<br>chemical reactions can actually happen<br>inside cells and there's just one<br>example of the kind of thing that that<br>we heard a little bit about and for the<br>biochemist in the audience you'll<br>recognize this is the first step in the<br>breakdown of glucose which is a chemical<br>molecule that we use for obtaining<br>energy so as fast in a suit by the idea<br>you can think about living things in<br>chemical terms so inspired by that I<br>went off to university and there I<br>discovered bacteria and why bacterial<br>come to the university first of all so<br>as Kurt mentioned I went to University<br>in Edinburgh there's not the University<br>this is the old town in Edinburgh I put<br>this picture up probably because this<br>house is a bit of a historical landmark<br>but often because our team lives two<br>buildings down the road in that place<br>there and that's actually really cool<br>being right in the middle of Edinburgh I<br>appreciate the timing with hindsight<br>appreciate even more but that one where<br>I spent most of my time I spent most of<br>my time ins building here which is<br>actually where the University of<br>Edinburgh had its microbiology<br>department which about 20 minutes away<br>from the center of town and isn't quite<br>so nice photograph but I think brightest<br>sunlight would not make the building<br>that much better<br>however I discovered bacteria there and<br>bacteria I thought were great because<br>they're what by the time seemed simple<br>organisms unlike us who contain hundreds<br>of millions of cells bacteria contain<br>their single-cell Watkins one cell does<br>everything and that I thought made them<br>nice and simple and for sure says simple<br>I was at the time but that made them<br>simpler things to study so this is<br>bacteria there's a single cell looking<br>down the electron microscope a very<br>powerful microscope there's actually<br>bacteria growing on a petri dish which<br>many of the scientists in the audience<br>will be familiar with there's a dish<br>roughly the size of a compact disc and<br>you cover that with a gel that provides<br>all the food the bacteria need to grow<br>and one of these cells has been put on<br>the dish at each of these points Anne's<br>grown up and made lots and lots of new<br>vict'ry to these little sort of pinhead<br>sized things will contain hundreds of<br>the other thing had scoured Edinburgh<br>was that bacteria darndest biochemist<br>want for genetically wonderful so<br>bacteria is quite straightforward to<br>obtain mutant strains whack specific<br>proteins specific enzymes that do<br>specific jobs inside the cell and I was<br>intrigued by these because they may help<br>you understand biochemistry which I was<br>and am in love with but also they're<br>interesting in themselves and what I<br>forgot to do actually found in my office<br>they'll never throw anything out I<br>actually have a copy of my honours<br>dissertation for as the Edinburgh I was<br>going to pray in too long as I had to<br>somehow justify keeping it for thirty<br>years but I missed the opportunity sir<br>another thirty years we'll see what I<br>can do with it okay so after Edinburgh I<br>went to Oxford to carry out my PhD and<br>there I worked on this bacterium called<br>bacillus thoughtless and these like<br>Alana showed before the cylindrical<br>things but there are quite unusual I<br>guess the most bacteria but they can<br>grow not just in this form but he can go<br>into a completely different form which<br>shown here and this is a spore which is<br>a resting stage which is very<br>resistant to desiccation and heat and<br>these bacteria make these and then they<br>can live in the soil dormant for a long<br>long time and they make them when times<br>are bad and then when times are good<br>when food comes along they can reverse<br>the process<br>so it's intrigued by this I learnt about<br>it a little bit in my undergraduates and<br>then the leading person in Britain work<br>in this field was this giant horned jaw<br>Mandelstam who's working at University<br>of Oxford and I couldn't tax him about<br>the possibility of doing a PhD and ended<br>up going there and Joe was great guys<br>really inspiring supervisor is very<br>bright very smart guy but he also ran a<br>very nice group Anita lovely is lovely<br>person so I had great fun doing my PhD<br>there's actually a picture from my PhD<br>thesis this shows that as the bacteria<br>transition from going from these this<br>growing form to this resting form they<br>go through a number of defined stages so<br>what I was doing my PhD was essentially<br>obtaining mutants of the bacteria that<br>lost the ability to go through this<br>whole process I turned that they were<br>blocked at different stage they might<br>get this far and then get stuck they<br>might get this far and then get stuck or<br>whatever and we used these to try and<br>understand the genetics of what was<br>going on and basically what is known as<br>these bacteria contain koi 50 perhaps a<br>bit more genes are required for this<br>whole process to take place so that was<br>really I guess classical book tio<br>genetics taking cells getting mutants<br>that have lost the property to do<br>something and round about this time in<br>the early 1980s was just stuff to become<br>widespread was what we now know as<br>molecular genetics we actually studied<br>genes and molecular level<br>so what could do here as you get<br>bacteria and say okay they got stuck<br>here that's because a mutation in a gene<br>but we had no idea what that gene was<br>actually doing why that mutation in that<br>so what once do is do that has said this<br>discipline of electro genetics really<br>start to fully flower some molecular<br>genetics I've used the description of<br>how genes work so I've already talked<br>about genes are the units inside cells<br>that century give itself their property<br>but question is how do they actually do<br>that so in the 1980s methods for<br>actually purifying genes out of cell to<br>just becoming commonplace before last<br>all you could do to say the cell<br>contains five six seven thousand genes<br>but there's really no good way of<br>surprising one for another okay and the<br>younger people in the audience probably<br>can't even visits what that's like but<br>for us at the time that's a big<br>challenge so I was really intrigued and<br>how did you can do this because then you<br>can start analyzing single genes and<br>so I looked around at a number of<br>possibilities what I end up doing was<br>going to work in Australia at University<br>of Adelaide with this guy called Barry<br>Egan and Adelaide is really at that time<br>the center by far the best place in<br>strea<br>for looking at this kind of molecular<br>genetic research there's a really good<br>place for me to go what Barry is working<br>on was not bacteria itself but a virus<br>that infects the bacteria and when I<br>said bacteria really small these things<br>are really really small so this is 100<br>nanometers so bacteria I didn't talk<br>about but this says that you can get a<br>thousand of these and we stack them up<br>near something as a millimeter in size<br>so in biological terms that's pretty<br>tiny so why is Barry working this and<br>why as I understand it well maybe it<br>could do quite a lot of things that were<br>a lot of fun<br>oops so first thing is even though this<br>is very simple when it contains about 40<br>genes it's got two alternative<br>lifestyles like the but pure and the<br>bacillus that I talked about before you<br>can switch between two different forms<br>now you think of iris couldn't we do<br>that what this virus does most of the<br>time for us<br>I guess main lifestyle this will affect<br>bacterial cells make forty or fifty<br>copies of itself<br>kill the cell and then the virus gets<br>out and can go off and look for norm or<br>self to live on it has an alternative<br>lifestyle words where it will affect the<br>bacterial cell and then nothing happens<br>it sort of balances the book t oh just<br>keep on living they're quite happy what<br>the virus has done is that it hasn't<br>completely disappeared it's taken its<br>genetic material buts stuck in the<br>structure here and cooperated that into<br>the DNA into the jetting material of the<br>bacterial cell so it's gone into a<br>dormancy mode and that can go on for a<br>long long time and then every so often<br>for no reason the virus will go back<br>into its killer mode and the book - and<br>make more copies of itself and the<br>bacterial cells will die okay so I was<br>intrigued by that aspect yeah thing was<br>that this is really great for doing<br>molecular genetics because it's quite<br>small it only has 40 or 50 genes which<br>means ox has relatively small amount of<br>DNA so purifying one or two genes out of<br>that is quite straightforward there are<br>also good methods doing traditional<br>genetics of kind I talked about before<br>and those kind of go hand in hand the<br>other thing that became clear to me<br>while I was working in Adelaide on that<br>system is what as crucial is not just<br>which genes you have but which ones are<br>active at any one time and the virus is<br>a really good example of that that in<br>his dormancy mode only probably one<br>maybe two of its genes are working the<br>rest are completely silent and his life<br>mode basically every gene is whose<br>what's done as making more and more<br>viruses so as I put in order the song<br>play and what you got to it users<br>control of gene activity when you make<br>the work as opposed to when they're not<br>working that bleeped tells you that<br>really determines what in this case a<br>virus but also how a cell is going to be<br>working okay sir as per have said in<br>1987 I came to at Argo things were a bit<br>more informal than when we appoint<br>people nowadays nowadays we have a very<br>complex election process where people or<br>apply for a vacancy we obtain referees<br>reports from some of the candidates or<br>send some of them here have some<br>come here for interviews or give talks<br>about what they do we'll discuss the<br>research we'll discuss their teaching<br>it's really very detailed process in<br>those days is much more informal so the<br>head of the farm to that time was George<br>Peterson what happened was that<br>basically I wrote let's deparment's in<br>response to that but they put out saying<br>I'd like to apply for this position I<br>heard nothing more about it for a while<br>then when I was in the lab when they<br>just finished off my experiment I got a<br>phone call from NIMH or at half an hour<br>discussion about what I teach if I came<br>to a target and I know had nothing more<br>but until I letter in the mail telling<br>me that the job was mine now hey sir I<br>thought that was good I knew nothing<br>that a target at all except that a<br>friend from Oxford who's here who told<br>me that the department was a good place<br>to work<br>he's absolutely right it's been a<br>fantastic place to work but I got your<br>had been a big focus not a big focus the<br>entire focus of our conversation been<br>what we would teach on no I did any<br>discussion about what research I do when<br>I got here so I write just the same was<br>true turned out when I got to you about<br>four members of the staff were on leave<br>so I sort of thrown into teaching I sort<br>of got to your Sunday and back next<br>Thursday running my first class and the<br>week after that I was giving a session<br>to fourth-year students and that's great<br>fun but beyond that I sat in my office<br>and thought about things and as a bit<br>surprised nobody came and said so what<br>are you going to get up to then but I<br>figured that I should do some research<br>so I said well what do I work on and<br>there's a wonderful opportunity once in<br>a lifetime of Trudie really to decide<br>what's gonna be best thing to work on so<br>what would I like to work on and there's<br>really coming back to why do we work on<br>what we do so I reached my hand thought<br>about this quite a lot and I wonder<br>something who's gonna fit in with what<br>I've learnt already and with my<br>interests in working with microbes are<br>also with bacteria I with biochemistry<br>and with genetics so I want something<br>that's going to be gentle characterized<br>not an organ that nobody knew nothing<br>about something that was trapped or in<br>other words you could manipulate it<br>reasonably easily genetically somebody<br>would be suitable for students to work<br>on so not something that<br>was gonna be really hard or really<br>dangerous somebody suitable for carrying<br>out biochemistry somehow thoughts would<br>be relevant in medical school but yeah<br>well you can see that bit yourself I<br>thought it would not look good at my<br>first June died of bubonic plague so<br>these are my sort of criteria I looked<br>around in terms of what I worked on<br>already and came up with the magical<br>answer which Pseudomonas aeruginosa and<br>many of you will know this bacteria we<br>worked on pretty much soon as I started<br>we still handled very intensively so<br>this basically ticked all boxes as fast<br>growing as easy to handle in lab he<br>already had done these classical<br>genetics with it so we knew a bit about<br>the genes for it doesn't infect healthy<br>people but in fact people who got<br>various pre-existing conditions so the<br>examples could endure cystic fibrosis or<br>severe burns and implants etc and this<br>wouldn't me very well because I thought<br>unlike the other students in the lab<br>assistive eyebrows this or severe burns<br>or implant so they'd probably be safe<br>even if they didn't handle bacteria very<br>well the I think we knew already bet it<br>was secretes various toxins and enzymes<br>during infections and this was room just<br>to me biochemically so these are the<br>bacteria there's actually picture I<br>shortly before these are picture with<br>bacteria like neurons I showed her sort<br>of rod saloons called structures this is<br>actually a diagram representing that in<br>a reasonably cartoony form so what you<br>have is a sort of envelope which<br>surrounds the bacteria which basically<br>keeps everything inside in the middle of<br>that you have the DNA genetic material<br>the genetic material of the bacteria and<br>then then what was actually quite a<br>complex structure and the species so<br>it's got two different membranes all<br>cells are surrounded by a single<br>membrane which keeps everything in and<br>controls what goes in and out in<br>bacteria and these bacteria you have a<br>second membrane that century adds to<br>that control of trafficking of chemicals<br>in and out of the cell cell wants to<br>make sure that good things get in food<br>nice stuff but as I'm on letting things<br>will be bad for it and also needs to get<br>rid of things<br>but it doesn't need anymore okay so if<br>you remember right back to the start<br>can I put Arne and infection into the<br>title and I've talked about those<br>herders aren't fitting well we know that<br>we need to iron in our diets or you get<br>through spinach or eating red meats or<br>buying on containing tablets but book<br>tearing you down as well and we end up<br>to your need our because it's a crucial<br>component of some enzymes that we<br>actually absolutely have to have if<br>we're going to be able to live so but to<br>need our as well but they're not the<br>same option as us they're not<br>particularly great going down to<br>supermarket and buying a pack of vitamin<br>tablets so what do they do<br>the problem for the bacteria is that<br>where they live Arn is not readily<br>available so Pseudomonas lives<br>widespread in the soil picture soul but<br>in soil the Arn is very enjoyable it's<br>really you know it's like microscopic<br>rocks it's not just very diffuse into<br>the bacterial cells and people you think<br>well it must be our master suite darn<br>and that's right<br>but the iron is tightly bound up to<br>proteins and not in a form that's just<br>waiting to get inside bacterial cells so<br>the bacteria have a problem and they get<br>around this by secreting compounds a<br>really very good binding art that can go<br>and hunt the AR and for them so they can<br>get it inside their cells okay so I put<br>up a few examples of these for if you're<br>chemically or in T is it then you can<br>feast your eyes on these beautiful<br>things for a moment or two if you're not<br>so chemically inclined then what's my<br>hands so what the bacteria does is to<br>create these chemicals out of themselves<br>and essentially they go around looking<br>for R and molecules when they find one<br>they latch onto very very firmly and<br>then it can take that up again and<br>deliver the arm back into the cells so<br>time to come inside I think okay step<br>that's why I've tried to represent in<br>this little diagram so this meant to be<br>a bacterial cell and here are the two<br>membranes on the outside that I talked<br>about and in the middle there's all DNA<br>that contains all jeans would Bo need to<br>be their happy little selves and out<br>here there's an Assam of iron that the<br>bacteria wants on the inside because<br>need they are to be able to grow that's<br>what happens so bacteria the cells just<br>like ours are chock-a-block with all the<br>chemicals that they need to be alive and<br>I've represented these in a rather non<br>chemical form and what the bacteria want<br>to do is meet one of these aren't<br>creating compounds so what they have to<br>do is to essentially assemble that from<br>whole world of different bits so these<br>are the bits that are going to assemble<br>into one of the arm scavenging compounds<br>that I talked about before so how do<br>they do that<br>what they have to do is to really these<br>guys aren't gonna come together all by<br>themselves but you have to make a whole<br>set of enzymes they're going to assemble<br>all the bits into the iron scavenging<br>compound so what happens at the genes<br>genes in the bacteria make these enzymes<br>and join them all together but then<br>chemical darn scavenger is made and<br>squeezed out of the cell<br>and it's going around looking for the<br>iron that it can latch on to find some<br>joins onto its to make a complex of the<br>to join together and that's on the<br>outside of the bacterial cells<br>it's no use there look two aren't inside<br>get it inside what they do is have<br>special proteins sit on the outside of<br>the cell two receptor proteins that very<br>specifically bind these guys and take<br>them inside so these aren't able to get<br>through the membranes all by themselves<br>you have to a protein to help them out<br>so this binds to the protein what<br>happens is that the arms transported<br>inside and the chemical was sent out the<br>iron scavenging chemicals sent out it's<br>gone for more iron<br>so there's how the bacteria around the<br>problem that the arm the very little arm<br>is around very scarce are they can get<br>inside the cells so an outline we knew<br>that before I start to toggle and<br>Pseudomonas we didn't know anything<br>about it<br>except that we knew that we made they<br>made this kind of thing but in principle<br>this had beat her things works so this<br>is the molecule that we knew about at<br>the start should know in science<br>covering module molecule PI over T and<br>what I've tried to do in this stop I've<br>tried hard to try to tackle terms to<br>minimum but this is the only one but I<br>think I'm going to use PI over T and<br>there's two reasons for that the first<br>one is I'm probably constitutionally<br>incapable of giving a talk without<br>mentioning it at least by accident the<br>second is that I don't think it should<br>be just a technical term this is<br>fantastic molecule I think everybody<br>should know this word so I'm not gonna<br>rest until there's Tony up on crosswords<br>and in pub quizzes and you guys know the<br>answers right so privately so it's<br>actually a nice to arrest molecule sort<br>of what are we showing you these are<br>places of bacterial life that stood<br>before these bacteria here and something<br>resembling my name are making the pie of<br>Earth which is wonderful yellow green<br>fluorescent compound these bacteria are<br>not you can see the very clear<br>difference I should say that anybody who<br>knows me will know I didn't make this<br>plate I can't write this well with a pen<br>so this is made by Lewis Martin who<br>works in my lab so these are the<br>bacteria growing instead of growing on a<br>gel growing in liquid and liquid culture<br>and these guys are making the pie<br>verdant and lastly a fluorescent words<br>these ones that are much more dull<br>they're not making the compound then<br>just compound underneath all right so<br>when I started what do we actually know<br>well we knew that the fire verdant is<br>maize but we didn't know it a lot about<br>what controls that we know if you add on<br>to the growth medium then the bacteria<br>don't make it anymore that sort of makes<br>sense hey they want to save energy<br>B if you have too much arm B or take up<br>too much our integral causing themselves<br>people can get iron overload syndrome so<br>can bacteria so we knew our controls<br>production of the pie averting but also<br>production of two different proteins the<br>bacteria secrete we're trying to cause<br>an infection<br>but that was it okay that's all we knew<br>at the mechanistic level actually how<br>does that work what's happening inside<br>the cells that anointment characterized<br>another species of bacteria which is got<br>some similarities to Pseudomonas or<br>people identified an on/off switch is a<br>master controller that has returned<br>inside the cells that went too much arms<br>around then things would be shut down so<br>I'm going to tell you just a little bit<br>about that because that forms a sort of<br>platform for what we did with the<br>Pseudomonas okay so this is again<br>representing our bacterial cell and here<br>is one of these Escherichia coli cells<br>busy making this compound and taking up<br>iron and being happy and let's see it<br>does a good job<br>so the key protein that are called<br>inhibitor protein it's job is to control<br>the activity of these genes when cells<br>contain lots of iron they'll be quiet<br>when the cells contain very little iron<br>then these will be active and the iron<br>scavenging compound gets made how does<br>that happen how can how can a protein do<br>that well the answer is that this<br>protein is only really active when it<br>joins on to arm<br>so itself none of much are inside then<br>others sort of swim around waiting for a<br>good day at the amount of iron inside<br>the cell builds up that joins on to the<br>protein and that then latches onto the<br>DNA onto the genes that are making these<br>enzymes when that happens then now the<br>genes can't work anymore okay they don't<br>work<br>then they don't make the enzymes are<br>needed for joining the jigsaw pieces<br>together and if you don't join the<br>jigsaw pieces together then you don't<br>get your chemical be made and then<br>everything goes quiet okay so that was a<br>molecular switch that was present in<br>this species as sure as your coli what<br>actually happens in Pseudomonas so these<br>are the questions do we had how is iron<br>scavenging the truth and our species as<br>opposed to this other eco lies species<br>and also how this relates to the<br>production of a toxin the quarries that<br>I've talked about before and I told you<br>that these the important infection are<br>made by the bacteria unless you add<br>aren't and when they stop making it so<br>does production of this connects to<br>production of this all right so my long<br>think after I arrived in Dunedin was a<br>long lines of this is the puzzle how do<br>we actually saw it<br>and there's the approach that we took we<br>said all right let's Bureau fighter<br>genes are needed for making this<br>chemical or perversion once you've<br>purified those you can analyze those we<br>can also use them determine the<br>mechanisms control their activities what<br>turns when they're on what determines<br>when they're off and last of all once<br>you've identified that for pyre burn the<br>iron scavenging compound let's see the<br>same essence control production of these<br>guys again alder members the audience<br>for a member time when polymerase chain<br>reaction didn't exist plumber a chain<br>reaction essentially are compulsory to<br>one or biochemistry type labs these days<br>and it's hard to imagine a time when it<br>didn't exist but one spawn entire didn't<br>a long time ago when I started<br>was the case so what I've learned in<br>Adelaide was how to actually purify<br>jeans by doing this method called<br>cloning or essentially purifying jeans<br>after the bacteria so we did this when I<br>say we did this what I mean is that<br>about three different PhD students<br>worked on this so it took quite a lot of<br>time but we purified three different<br>genes and we had proved that they were<br>actually involved in the process that we<br>thought we were by engineering<br>Pseudomonas bacteria so those jeans were<br>inactivated and then the bacteria can<br>make the enzymes and then the process of<br>making the compound stopped so there's a<br>plate I showed before this is our<br>bacteria that are making the compound<br>these were one of the strains that we<br>engineered that have lost that ability<br>so that proves without to identify the<br>genes that we wanted so then we said<br>okay that's cool well actually controls<br>them so we used a range of approaches<br>which I'm not going to go into but since<br>we found a master on switch that<br>triggers all these genes to be activated<br>or at the same time there's no point in<br>activating one or two and making only<br>some of the enzymes you need inserts<br>them all one at the same time<br>Pseudomonas has got a crafty mechanism<br>for doing exactly that okay so this is<br>it here the genes just waiting to make<br>their enzymes to to make our magical<br>chemical so what Pseudomonas has is gene<br>encoding a particular protein that I've<br>called activator because it's job is to<br>activate and activate these genes to<br>make them work when it does then all<br>steps that I talked about before happen<br>and the enzymes get made and the<br>chemical gets made and the arm gets<br>taken up and the bacterial smile and are<br>happy so this is different from species<br>that I talked about before although that<br>turns out to be quite a common way of<br>controlling production of these<br>chemicals so that told us a lot about<br>making the arm placing compounds all<br>bears the things that actually<br>contribute to the infections toxin the<br>protease and it turns out that affects<br>those as well so toxin the protease just<br>like the aren't creating compounds I've<br>been fooled by genes<br>so here our genes and our activator can<br>activate those as well and then what<br>will happen is that the toxin the<br>proteins get made and that helps the<br>bacteria to cause the infection so this<br>fitted with our original idea we're<br>really the light of this order together<br>because our original hypothesis that a<br>single messenger control in production<br>of this chemical and also of these<br>proteins had turned out to be right sir<br>but now ten or fifteen years after we<br>started to turn that that's true that's<br>cool but the bacteria are making the<br>stuff of making these things they're<br>gonna be taking up on they hope and<br>eventually they're gonna suffer from<br>iron overload<br>how do they get around that how do you<br>switch it off okay so sensor we have a<br>similar kind of protein to the one I<br>talked about earlier on which inhibitor<br>protein that's only active when the ions<br>present inside the bacterial cells so<br>what that does that binds to the arm<br>when that happens it joins on to the<br>gene encoding that evade of protein to<br>block it stop it from working and that's<br>gonna switch everything off nor stop the<br>whole chain of events and then magically<br>nothing happens so the activator protein<br>goes away then the genes that I would<br>normally active eating just go silent<br>again the enzymes don't get made and<br>this compound is not going to get made<br>and everything goes quiet okay so I<br>think we're getting towards enough for<br>those kind of circuits but last point<br>time to make that it's what we found<br>subsequent to that so the activity that<br>tavira protein is controlled not only by<br>how much Ahrens inside the cells but by<br>a second protein that basically joins<br>onto it to stop it from working so this<br>protein joins on to the nectar Vater and<br>then it can't do anything even though<br>it's present inside the cells and a<br>second switch that I'm not going to<br>really talk price controls the sky so<br>can be active or inactive and if the<br>regulator says go to it the niche genes<br>will be expressed the regulator says no<br>we're going to turn things off then<br>okay so poor are we at really what we're<br>doing now say okay we've identified the<br>circuit inside the bacterial cells we're<br>looking hard at the mechanisms that<br>control sec tivity and yeah i think<br>we're doing is really saying okay we<br>established this as one paradigm<br>Pseudomonas aeruginosa if we look at<br>other similar systems do we work the<br>same way<br>and the answer Russ prizes you the other<br>systems that you'd think the genes say<br>we work in the same way well you<br>actually go into detail just like this<br>isn't the same at all so we're trying to<br>figure out what are the similarities and<br>differences between systems that<br>okay so let's pour the most heavy-duty<br>parts of my top what ions do indulge<br>myself for a couple of minutes talk a<br>little bit about the subject how is PI<br>over 2 mate so what I've done we've been<br>talking very happily about thing<br>together bits of jigsaws and having<br>balls of string doing the work but<br>biochemical terms that's let's define<br>the now it would be like okay and that<br>didn't quite satisfy me because the<br>whole reason I got into biochemist in<br>the first place where I like the idea of<br>chemical reactions inside cells like the<br>idea of what's actually going on it's<br>all I said was look I'm never gonna be<br>as famous to those guys in 1940s and 50s<br>that discovered all great biochemical<br>pathways that everybody knows and loves<br>although I do the advanced I'm not yet<br>dead so that gives me the opportunity to<br>figure out a pathway of my own so what<br>we did was to identify basically all of<br>the enzymes are needed for making this<br>compound which is 15 we determined the<br>functions of about three or four of them<br>actually by chemically characterizing<br>the enzyme in the test tube the rest we<br>can make very good predictions just by<br>analyzing the sequences of those enzymes<br>that allows proposed a pathway for<br>making the PI reverting compounds I'm<br>not going to walk through this s1 but it<br>was diagram to show that<br>it's quite complicated but we were happy<br>with it<br>in fact we've done quite a lot of work<br>since we proposed this originally that<br>actually matches up with the functions<br>we ascribe to the different enzymes so I<br>don't think I'm ever gonna be in center<br>of the textbooks but I can say hey look<br>at least we figure that one biochemical<br>pathway okay<br>blank so blank says all right we've had<br>great fun doing all these kind of things<br>looking at the bacteria in the border<br>we've learned a lot about how they work<br>figured out a lot of fundamental things<br>that's very nice but the question is how<br>does that you relate disease okay we do<br>all these experiments in the lab but how<br>does that actually connect in to your<br>life if you want to call it that - what<br>happens inside the patient's Pseudomonas<br>infection<br>so what happens inside the patients so<br>cystic fibrosis is one of the diseases<br>that I talked about that Pseudomonas<br>provides a problem for and skirts head<br>at the start there is real problem that<br>you're very hard to eradicate they're<br>very resistant to antibiotics città<br>fibrosis is a very common we thought<br>genetic disease about 500 patients in<br>New Zealand this kind of number in the<br>country the size of New Zealand means<br>that everything you want just go into<br>well many people in the audience will<br>know somebody who knows somebody whose<br>sister osis what happens is lungs of the<br>patients become chronically infected<br>with the bacteria and there's bad news<br>for the patients okay<br>because it's been shown that once they<br>become infected then their health<br>declines and what will happen with the<br>patients is that they live their life<br>expectancy is greatly reduced it's<br>presently roughly about 40 years on<br>average some patients will live all<br>longer than that some will die a lot<br>sooner<br>okay so here our pet Pseudomonas living<br>in the lab on a gel in a soup<br>whichever you don't need to be a<br>scientist or micropiles - biochemist to<br>tell that this is different from this<br>okay but here<br>Pseudomonas are living inside the lungs<br>of a piece and cystic fibrosis this<br>a very different place for them so quite<br>likely they're all chemistry their whole<br>how they work is gonna be very very<br>different from what we see in the lab<br>and that's fine but how can we actually<br>analyze that so that's important we<br>start wrestling with bit over 10 years<br>ago and we made a little bit of progress<br>and then what happens six years ago was<br>that out of the blue light of email from<br>this guy dr. David Reed who's a<br>clinician or Spur chief physician who<br>works in Hobart in Tasmania and his job<br>in Tasmania was to look after all of the<br>patients to manage the health of the<br>patients in Tasmania who have cystic<br>fibrosis so he got in touch me as they<br>out of the blue but he was very<br>interested in this question of her<br>bizarre and Fidan thought the bacteria<br>are doing cystic fibrosis and I think<br>you'd find some of our papers and the<br>good we might be able to help him answer<br>some of those questions and that<br>connection is really taking things long<br>way forward<br>so since why process is a picture that<br>DIMM provided so this is actually an<br>x-ray of patient with suit fibrosis and<br>this kind of clouding is telling you<br>that volumes of the lungs are they<br>should be nice and clear there it<br>blocked up with general gunge this is<br>some of the guns that the patients cough<br>up so every month then the patients go<br>to a clinic to have a check-up they get<br>their general status checked but they<br>also provide a sample of all the stuff<br>is in their lungs for analysis and this<br>is kind of thing that you get not very<br>nice and you can see why the patients<br>aren't very well what you can isolate<br>from that these are some Pseudomonas<br>bacteria as you can see these look very<br>different from the ones that I showed<br>you before what happens is that as the<br>bacteria grow in cystic fibrosis they<br>change into a different kind of a form<br>this much more gel like form and that's<br>not going to do the patients any good at<br>all<br>Billu the emphasize and what I said<br>before that in the lungs of the patients<br>bacteria can be behaving quite<br>differently from when they've just been<br>spending their entire lives living the<br>laboratory<br>okay so what are we decide to do so we<br>said all right instead of going the<br>bacteria in the lab who can actually<br>look at what they're doing inside the<br>samples that come out of the patients<br>and that's course we can get try to look<br>inside the patient's themselves so what<br>we've done is to collect sputum sample<br>from patients which David did for us and<br>then he sent those to us for analysis<br>what I want to do is to analyze their<br>own optic pathways of the bacteria<br>actually as it's happening in sputum<br>itself which is effectively is the same<br>as in the patient so how can we do that<br>well I mentioned already the pervert is<br>a beautiful fluorescent molecule and as<br>well as looking at for many hours just<br>thinking how wonderful it is we can take<br>advantage of that property to actually<br>detect it and complex complex mixtures<br>fluoresce the molecules have got very<br>special spectral properties that means<br>that even if you've got lots of other<br>things there you can detect them very<br>specifically so that's basically what we<br>did we use this to measure the amount of<br>perversion of sputum samples we applied<br>to about 150 samples from 31 different<br>patients and what do we find out we<br>found out that in many samples from most<br>of the patients our compound perversion<br>is present so that says bacteria don't<br>do anything for nothing after making it<br>they must be using it to be able to<br>obtain our to cause infections but in<br>some patients wouldn't find any poverty<br>at all sounds a bit of a puzzle and some<br>patients sort of in between and some<br>samples we'd see small amounts of cavern<br>but now they would see none so that was<br>second approach we decided to use was to<br>say all right instead of looking at the<br>actual PI of Verdun we'll look at the<br>genes that are being used to make it<br>because if those genes are active then<br>that says bacteria making paya Verdun as<br>they're not active then tavernas not<br>being made like I've talked about before<br>so basically we developed a method for<br>saying are these genes active inside<br>sputum sample measure<br>expression of productivity in the sputum<br>okay so what did we find<br>so when we look to the PI of Vernon<br>genes we looked at three different genes<br>with these particular names in the<br>number of patients and this is sent to<br>the range values that we got so said in<br>most of the patients the genes are<br>active in other words the prior burdens<br>being made or look the amount varies<br>between patients and that's exactly the<br>same conclusion that we got from look to<br>but in some the amount is very low or<br>negligible and some we couldn't detect<br>any expression that says that our<br>magical wonderful compound is very<br>important but not the whole answer to<br>have but you're actually obtaining are<br>inside the patient we can make it<br>crucial in the lab but inside the<br>patient there's more going on so we said<br>well Kira it's not like they've evolved<br>some fantastic we are blooming without<br>arm they must have found some other way<br>of getting all of the stuff so it looks<br>at various examples on its gonna talk<br>about one or the last thing I'll be<br>talking about what about other iron<br>uptake systems one example opted a<br>caffeine so heme is a chemical it's<br>present in people in large amounts we<br>all know about it because that's what<br>gives your blood the color carries the<br>oxygen around your blood as part of<br>approaching hemoglobin so you can see<br>some of that might be present along to<br>the patient's if their disease is pretty<br>bad if some blood was leaking into their<br>lungs even just trace amounts be enough<br>because of bacteria bit of on that they<br>could use so we developed the same kind<br>of mechanism for looking at the presence<br>of heme optic systems team acquisition<br>systems in the bacteria controlling to<br>the patients and these are different<br>genes that we looked at say can the<br>bhaktir take up him inside the patients<br>and the answer is that yes they can is<br>the implication in some cases the<br>expression of these genes is very high<br>and that says the bacteria are very<br>actively expressing systems for<br>acquiring kiemce inside the patients and<br>if you can do that boy don't need<br>private or perhaps that backs up<br>perversion system that says these<br>okay so that's giving us insights and<br>what's actually happening inside the<br>patients can we apply this at all well<br>as a start point the kind of method that<br>we used for analyzing samples inside the<br>sputum we can use that for looking not<br>just at PI over and jeans or hem jeans<br>but lots of other different genes<br>so when principal that approach can get<br>a good idea how it'd be really behaving<br>inside the patient's where it really<br>matters there's two aspects of all work<br>that I described that were exploring in<br>terms of can we actually make people<br>better one of just really initiated by<br>David Reed is to say aura but tear who<br>need art if they want to be able to grow<br>and all our research is telling us that<br>but they're actively acquiring art<br>inside the patient's so in principle if<br>you can start with tear that arm to be<br>stuck don't be able to grow anymore<br>so can we add or called our creators<br>aren't binding chemicals those stars of<br>a kirov are so they can't grow so that's<br>something we'll be exploring a bit with<br>David's second approach that we've used<br>is a bacterial Pseudomonas bacteria tick<br>up this compound pi verdun very well now<br>big problems to the monus is that it's<br>very resistant to antibiotics and one<br>reason is the antibiotic just conquered<br>inside the cells the sort of bouncing<br>around off the outside of the self but<br>it can't get in where they need to<br>actually be to work to kill the bacteria<br>so the concept is if you join<br>antibiotics on papaya verdun the<br>material to take up this and<br>inadvertently take up the antibiotic as<br>well and then die and in principle has<br>been shown that can work so we're doing<br>some work on that with a colleague mark<br>miller in the USA who came here as<br>sabbatical visitor a couple of years<br>back<br>okay so I'm start wrapping up sir and on<br>to do the anything and have thanks to<br>everybody so nonetheless thank yous to<br>lots of collaborators so science these<br>days it's very much not one person<br>beaten with by themselves like it might<br>have been 100 years ago it really<br>involves teams of people and I really<br>want to give a very sincere thank you to<br>all people who I've worked with<br>I thought these way of listing all those<br>was to write all the people have been on<br>papers that I've authored so these are<br>all my co-authors I think if you're not<br>there you think it should be then let me<br>by being hugely lucky over the years to<br>have wonderful people work in my lab<br>right from pretty much when I started<br>right up to right now and this is this<br>knew all those people it's a real one of<br>the great privileges being a university<br>academic is that you get chance to<br>mentor to train to encourage the sport<br>young people starting their careers in<br>science I've been very lucky that way so<br>there's basically a list of the people<br>who worked in my lab and there's been<br>great fun and hopefully they've got<br>something out of it I know some of them<br>have so thank you to all of them most of<br>all outside the lab so um Carolyn was<br>very patient Poland and Skilton creating<br>a lot of the figures that are used for<br>this talk departed biochemistry like I<br>said earlier they've been a fantastic<br>place to work so I had great colleagues<br>one it very supportive headed apart<br>they're doing really good so I'd like to<br>acknowledge them very much<br>these are the people who have provided<br>the money many of them external to<br>university the university itself has<br>been very good about supporting our<br>research and I think that funding is<br>really crucial as providing leverage for<br>getting funding from external<br>organizations so I think university<br>manages that side of things very well<br>and lastly most importantly I like to<br>thank my family for all support taunts<br>understanding as I like sort of worked<br>crazy hours and weekends and head out of<br>time for a day or two or a week or two<br>and they all seem to welcome me back<br>again<br>okay and last of all thank you very much<br>straightening well done it's been a it's<br>been colleagues I was reminded about<br>wonderful for me too I was reminded<br>together<br>I heard there's a song that has it's not<br>what you have it's what you do<br>I've got to hear this song<br>give me a beer or two I'll give you a<br>rendition but I think the overarching<br>thing we've seen is enthusiasm for<br>understanding life at the molecular<br>and then further they've actually given<br>and begun to address how this relates to<br>decide anything that all of us would<br>like to do and whether the tools were<br>much more primitive focus on its<br>analysis time when we have a deep<br>sequencing and we can sequence into<br>higher organisms and we can do these<br>powerful genetic experiments and we can<br>do structural biology and we can do the<br>entire you know so the sorts of<br>questions that you can be that you're<br>addressing now are even bigger and wider<br>in the Morgan patents I think with<br>yeah<br>so it just leaves me to give me an<br>arsenal tokens<br>Thank You collector and congratulations<br>again on your promotion</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
