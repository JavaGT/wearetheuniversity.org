nervous I<br>probably should be people say you<br>shouldn't be but I actually am nervous<br>and I probably should be right so I'm<br>here to talk about rivers and korto PD<br>Pomona Galway courtesy our core positive<br>fearow fearow teton gotta hit people hit<br>Tony fire hit people hit Tony far<br>Waikato Tony Faro<br>for those of you that don't know I'm<br>actually from the way cattle and that is<br>my Pippi ha the Waikato River is where I<br>am from I was born on the banks of the<br>Waikato River and Huntley and I grew up<br>at too long why why and what I in my<br>role were here so that slide up there<br>has real meaning to me not only as a<br>scholar but as a as a Maori living in<br>this country<br>a Maori who grew up in a river community<br>so today my accorded all with you my<br>talk with you will be about my my life<br>growing up around rivers and how my<br>experience as a Maori living on rivers<br>can enrich and enhance our understanding<br>of rivers and New Zealand so I've looked<br>in Auckland now for 25 years but I grew<br>up in Kent Street at turangawaewae marae<br>and all the will the streets a tell<br>Mariah named after monarchy you know<br>Kent Street I'd word Street Duke Street<br>Queen Street<br>and this house here is my grandparents<br>house in George Street and three months<br>ago my husband and I we returned to the<br>river and we bought my grandparents<br>house and we had to torn or torn all<br>means you have to put a burden against<br>other family members and I was the<br>winner and I now I'm the proud owner of<br>this little house in George Street at $2<br>why why MRI so our house and Kent Street<br>was across the fence from this house and<br>George Street and so going back to $2<br>why why we're there in the weekends most<br>weekends and the sounds of the more I<br>and Turanga why why are quite different<br>to the sounds of Auckland I'm very aware<br>now of sounds that I grew up with as a<br>child<br>the sounds of trains not aeroplanes the<br>sounds of rugby league and also the<br>sounds of the river which passes by<br>because our house is right across the<br>road from the river and also the other<br>thing that I've really become aware of<br>again is the fog the fog and the depth<br>which you don't experience here in<br>Auckland so I'm here to talk to you<br>today about Tim Arnott walked away and<br>many of you will be wondering what is<br>tomorrow or - why now - mana or - why is<br>an objective inside the national policy<br>statement for fresh water and when I<br>read this objective I thought what does<br>it really mean because it's really<br>ambiguous but they've plunked it right<br>in there and it's meant to give meaning<br>for about how we think about water and<br>how we what we do with water now the<br>problem is if you don't actually come<br>from a river community or you don't<br>actually have experience of living<br>around water and rivers or lakes or<br>wetlands it's really hard to actually<br>understand what all of this relationship<br>with water and River is all about well I<br>think anyway so what I'm going to try to<br>do today is to explain to manotaur - why<br>in the context of me returning to Nara<br>WA here and living it too long a while<br>why and looking at the way in which the<br>where I come from value the Waikato<br>River on our little patch remember we we<br>there are many many Maori groups that<br>live along this river and we all have<br>different ways of thinking about it<br>but what I want to try and do today is<br>talk to you or bring to life the concept<br>of termina or to way through my personal<br>experience now tomorrow or two Y is<br>another objective in the national policy<br>statement of a freshwater each community<br>will decide what terminal what's away<br>means to them based on their unique<br>relationship with freshwater and in<br>Maori freshwater<br>is known as why Maori and in the area<br>were all here the national policy<br>statement for fresh water defines<br>terminal Ottawa as the integrated and<br>holistic well-being of freshwater it is<br>up to communities and councils to decide<br>and to recognize what tamanna Ottawa<br>means to them in their regions so I<br>guess what I'm going to ask you today is<br>does this objective that is in this<br>national policy statement for fish water<br>does it actually have any teeth I don't<br>know if it does actually in all honesty<br>I'm trying to find its teeth but I can't<br>really find them but what I found out<br>about tomorrow - why is an objective is<br>that it is open to very broad<br>interpretations so it means that<br>community groups and councils can<br>actually interpret that objective in any<br>way they want to in ways that that give<br>them value and it is also not an<br>objective just for Maori<br>it is a universal objective which is<br>kind of odd because it's written in<br>Maori and I guess we're trying to Mary<br>Phi everybody in New Zealand will make<br>people bicultural but the fact that it<br>is a Maori term putting forth a<br>universal concept maybe and difficult<br>for some people to understand and people<br>may think that it's just for Maori<br>people<br>so elite from pick terminal or - why for<br>Maori in the region where I've been<br>bought where where my grant where I<br>bought my grandparents house what things<br>are important and valuable to Waikato<br>Maori now that word why castle is an<br>interesting word and<br>self because for many of you who know<br>why cut or why cuttle river 426<br>kilometres long the longest river in New<br>Zealand but at one end of the Waikato<br>River you have the 92-foot at all people<br>and at the other end of the river you<br>have why cattle people at too poor how<br>or why cousin or portway cattle now at<br>both ends of that river although the<br>name is the same both groups of people<br>have different definitions of what way<br>cattle means so paid to hood anui Jones<br>who is a very well known tiny scholar<br>back in 1959 defined why cattle for the<br>92-foot at or end around taupe or as<br>being kept of waters more recently<br>around the time of the treaty settlement<br>claims sir robert Mahuta who was from<br>guatemala and from the area that i'm<br>from defined the word why cut or to mean<br>full flowing river so can you see that<br>at both ends you already have this<br>contestation<br>around naming and what water and what<br>water can mean same name different<br>interpretations so where I come from it<br>too long why would I<br>we have these beautiful gates which on<br>the front of them have Tony far now Tony<br>far our water demons they can be<br>kaitiaki<br>shapeshifters and they can also be<br>creatures that that tell you what's<br>going to happen in the future and these<br>beautiful gates here were actually<br>carved by members of my far know who<br>actually originated Anunnaki far to her<br>at all RK and so they went went appear<br>set up to run away way more i back in<br>the 1920s they went back with her and<br>they took residence at turangawaewae<br>marae and they became the Carver's there<br>and so the maru swear i am from there we<br>are responsible for these gates here<br>there are out the front of two long<br>hallway<br>so back in there back in the seventies<br>when we were just preparing our treaty<br>settlement it was really important to<br>get all the cultural features right<br>to show the rest of the world that we<br>were a water people that cared about<br>rivers that our identity was intertwined<br>with rivers and that we should actually<br>have rights in the region and at that<br>time that was the only thing we could do<br>to get recognition from the crown<br>because all our land had been<br>confiscated and the only way that we<br>could make a claim to the region was<br>through our identity was the river we<br>were called Waikato Eyrie and of course<br>the river was there and at that time the<br>crown was saying well the government was<br>saying that nobody could own water and<br>therefore that was the way in which we<br>may we legitimated our claim to the<br>territory so things like this carvings<br>of TANF are are really important to us<br>so that's part of our value system<br>another part of our legitimating ourself<br>was to build a lot of waka Toa the wall<br>canoes and this one here is called<br>rangatahi it's some captained by one of<br>my friends his name is Cody hunter woody<br>hunter he's what we called the crate<br>tucky tucky and it's really important to<br>know that these types of activities<br>embody a whole lot of Maori knowledge<br>you know this knowledge here around waka<br>Toa tuning fleets of canoe on a river<br>takes a lot of specialisation and that<br>knowledge belongs to men so while I'm a<br>social scientist and very mental<br>anthropologists that I care about people<br>there are certain areas of knowledge<br>that I know that I just cannot go in<br>through because of my gender because of<br>my age and it's for them it's for them<br>to pass on to other young men not for me<br>to pass on to people through books so um<br>with knowledge comes responsibility<br>that's what I'm trying to say and these<br>are knowledge that are particular to<br>rivers so this is another canoe that we<br>built it out at our Mirai this is called<br>Tahiti ticki ticki and Tahira ticky<br>ticky is that the canoe that houses it<br>takes all them in from all over tiny wee<br>rangatahi which you saw is the canoe for<br>oh no sorry I get it wrong rangatahi is<br>the canoe that takes men from all over<br>tiny wee this canoe Tahir tikki tikki<br>takes men from all over from the four<br>ones if you want to if you want to be a<br>a peddler you can go and be on this this<br>canoe here but we have our very own<br>canoe called tumanako Hope which is just<br>reserved for marty-mar hooter which is<br>too long the way way and why he might I<br>people only so we have three main canoes<br>and all of those canoes embody a special<br>type of motto donor knowledge now what's<br>also really important to us at our marae<br>is the fact that in the future future<br>generations we want them to be able to<br>go to the river and to do the things<br>that we did you know swim catch eels<br>have that connection we want them to be<br>able to have access so these are some of<br>the values that are really important to<br>Maori from too long my way and these are<br>things that we will take into<br>consideration when we are trying to sort<br>out our version of tomorrow<br>what's away in the national policy<br>statement so who are these guys when I<br>did my PhD I decided I wanted to do a<br>PhD on rivers and the only way to get<br>into it at that senior level is to have<br>khimar Toa supporting you and I was very<br>lucky that my dad and his friends<br>thought that I'm maybe I could do a PhD<br>and I asked there are turkey at the time<br>was the Maori Queen can I do this PhD<br>and that's it was a bit odd because I<br>was a female and they thought it would<br>be a bit of topic for a male but anyway<br>then they back down and she sort of said<br>all she didn't say actually she didn't<br>say yes but she didn't say no so so I<br>just did it and anyway so what I did was<br>these guys took me for a hikoi and a car<br>not a walk up the length of the Waikato<br>River and when I got to the very end<br>this man here Jon Hamm is a rangatira<br>from touring and they took me to the -<br>Dungy<br>Information Center and then they laid<br>out all the might or honour for the<br>different river system which was the<br>from a who the far new in the Waikato<br>and all the tributaries and that's how<br>they passed our net knowledge of rivers<br>to me and also the relationships from<br>the different Erie and hapu groups in<br>the area were all delivered to me<br>through that model so that's important<br>so what I want to get across today are<br>some very simple things Maori are not<br>homogeneous and their understandings of<br>river rivers and the way that they talk<br>about local rivers for example where I'm<br>from in the Waikato it's along my way we<br>talk about the river being a couponer an<br>ancestor however two hundred kilometres<br>south they don't talk about the river is<br>being a to pronoun so the people from<br>Ngati Raukawa who are down in the talk<br>Aurora Patara do area they don't call it<br>a to pronoun they have their own way of<br>defining brothers so what I'm trying to<br>say is that there are some Maori<br>concepts they're just unique to some<br>Maori groups just like this new term<br>super well that's new for me but Fung<br>annoy people use the term super to talk<br>about their to pour our the fun nui<br>river but we don't have that too we talk<br>about to pronoun so basic ways of<br>talking about river we've got the word<br>our which is river<br>Tomer which a lot of maori use and that<br>can mean River natural resource natural<br>water body to pronoun or if you're from<br>so it's two point I feel from the west<br>coast if you're from the east coast it's<br>people now now and super a supernatural<br>being but all of those different terms<br>all mean River as well as those words to<br>define a river there are also some<br>really important Maori fundamental<br>concepts which create knowledge systems<br>are which create knowledge for rivers<br>and you'll hear a lot about people<br>talking about Modi the life force of<br>rivers all the top one the nor you know<br>the waahi tapu the sacred places of<br>rivers or even tiny far who are the<br>water demons that the shapeshifters<br>they're the creatures that can tell you<br>what's going to happen in the future and<br>rivers then there's Rahu II which is a<br>really important term for we arrived<br>from where you can prohibit people from<br>doing things it's kind of like a sort of<br>resource management and then there's<br>mana the authority to to be in a part of<br>the river and kaitiaki<br>the gardens and I have friends here from<br>Leiter who they have woods like mango<br>Kai which is gathering food gathering<br>from the river<br>what I'm trying to say is that different<br>Yui and hapu and and Mirai and fauna<br>have their own fundamental concepts<br>which hold their local knowledge errs<br>about rivers and what I really want to<br>get across today is that we shouldn't<br>homogenized this stuff that we should<br>realize the specificity that each group<br>has and then if we understand that then<br>we will be able to unpack and understand<br>this concept of tamanna or to why a lot<br>better<br>of course the Crown has a lot to do with<br>the way Maori talk about rivers now and<br>they in partnership with Maori creating<br>new terms for example most recently in<br>my tribe we have the river flipping from<br>being called to Pune our ancestor River<br>to our to pronounce ancestral River and<br>so when they created the new deed of<br>settlement in there the settlement<br>between the crown and our tribe about<br>the river they renamed the river to our<br>to Pune and that meant that this<br>ancestral river could be recognized as<br>being a river for all Maori and and all<br>other New Zealanders but also and<br>attached to cleanup fund to the river<br>the other big river was a new name<br>change lately is the fog new a river and<br>that is now known as Tarawa to port and<br>this river is really important because<br>it has the identity with similar Grigor<br>legal rights to a person it also has to<br>clean up fund attached to it the Waikato<br>River is not recognized as a legal<br>person now when you're thinking about oh<br>my gosh it's a legal person how can that<br>be well we have trusts and we have<br>commercial entities that are also<br>thought of as legal persons so it<br>shouldn't be so hard for you to get your<br>head around but I'm gonna say this the<br>record the recognition of a river as a<br>person produces a profound cultural<br>shift and the way we think about and<br>interact with rivers so I mean move<br>pushing you forward and I'm going to<br>push you a little bit to think about it<br>that way but you don't have to think<br>about it that way for the Waikato River<br>because we don't we think of it as an<br>ancestor okay so I'm going to end a<br>little on a sort of anthropological note<br>one of the classic<br>and anthropology is by a woman called<br>Mary Douglas and Mary Douglas it's<br>really hard to read this book because<br>when you go through it she talks about<br>he lists and he that and there's never<br>any reference to woman I think it was<br>that period in the 60s when women were<br>not included in the text even though she<br>was a professor and a female so a thing<br>that I like about Mary Douglas has<br>worked is that it gives me another way<br>to think about pollution and I think<br>when we talk about rivers in New Zealand<br>you can't not think about pollution but<br>this book purity and danger is an<br>analysis of the concepts of pollution<br>and taboo now a broad approach to<br>pollution it gives a broad approach to<br>pollution drawing on arguments of danger<br>separation and classification sacred<br>things are to be protected from<br>defilement for example rivers and do<br>subdue it is considered to be measure<br>out of place so do it can be anything<br>that doesn't belong something that<br>causes disorder and it's an interesting<br>way to think about stuff and she really<br>wrote the book to talk about religion<br>you know the way that Jewish people<br>would eat some things from the sea but<br>not other things and it's all about<br>polluting the way that we view pollution<br>and what deuter's and what doot isn't<br>and so for when some people think about<br>rivers in New Zealand they don't think<br>they're actually doing anything bad in<br>them but other people think they are now<br>for example if we were to look at these<br>next three slides coming up we have<br>power stations along the way cuttle<br>River and the white cultural River is<br>there with the trees er and this power<br>station actually does pollute because it<br>actually puts arsenic straight into the<br>river for Maori this power station is<br>what we would classify as matter out of<br>place it shouldn't be there it's not<br>part of the landscape and for many other<br>New Zealanders these sorts of<br>developments are also considered to be<br>matter out of place however having said<br>that these power stations are actually<br>on Maori land and actually shareholders<br>and these power stations are Maori<br>so it<br>all depends on the way in which you want<br>to look at things this is another one<br>more measure out of place again related<br>to electricity and dams being put there<br>in the middle of the the river a lot of<br>Maori wouldn't like them there but some<br>do and I mean I had to experience a<br>power cut on Saturday one whole day<br>without power was really difficult I<br>don't know how we would cope without<br>power stations without power and another<br>one this one's right on the back of<br>where I'm from more matter out of places<br>this Genesis's haven't lis power station<br>and it uses the Waikato River to cool<br>down the water and the problem with this<br>is that it heats up the water as it goes<br>out and it changes the ecosystems so all<br>of these things are measure out of place<br>and can be considered you know disposed<br>they can just be considered harmful so<br>the whole order and well-being of rivers<br>is important to all New Zealanders<br>and while ensuring that River waters are<br>drinkable and swimmable for future<br>generations we must not lose sight of<br>water ownership and water allocation<br>issues because at the moment what I<br>think is that we're talking a lot about<br>pollution and I mean I care about<br>pollution and and the thing is these<br>debates are generally carried out in<br>public and and the government allows us<br>to participate in these debates against<br>frontier against whoever the polluters<br>are but for me the real issue that we<br>cannot lose sight of is the water<br>ownership and water allocation<br>agreements that are being done and these<br>are done mostly in private so I suggest<br>these topics are pertinent to the<br>well-being and holder of rivers and 2030<br>and that we shouldn't take our eye off<br>the ball so that you are and this is the<br>way things can be interpreted<br>and anyway I'll leave you on a nice<br>slide noreda tena koe 13 our culture<br>teen are a total cutoff<br>no I can do it it's alright I'm just<br>having trouble with my microphone give<br>excuse me for a moment I'll just change<br>presentations<br>oops right hopefully it'll come up I've<br>chosen to call my part of this talk<br>rivers in space and time I am as Mike<br>said the scientist of the pair although<br>perhaps it's unfair to murmur and when<br>we talked about how we would share this<br>session I immediately said let me talk<br>about the pollution and the river stuff<br>please you could talk about all the<br>things you know about in detail but<br>please don't don't make me talk about<br>anything too complicated it I grew up on<br>a river as well and perhaps that's why<br>we fit together quite well in this<br>session I grew up on the matera River<br>and Southland and while I was growing up<br>the time between when I was first rear<br>of the of the river at the bottom of our<br>Road at the bottom of our farm and when<br>I went to university it was a time of a<br>dramatic change it was a time of<br>application of huge amounts of<br>fertilizer of beautification within our<br>river systems it was probably the time<br>when there was no wastewater treatment<br>there was very little control on<br>industry<br>it was the time during the 60s and 70s<br>early 70s when our water quality the<br>quality of our rivers was at its worst<br>much has changed since then<br>and I'd like to talk a little bit about<br>that today what's a river we've heard<br>about it what a river is from Maroma if<br>we want to define it it's a natural<br>stream of fresh water of fairly large<br>size flowing through a definite course<br>or channel and every River is a part of<br>the land which is it's larger system and<br>the activities in its larger system<br>that's its catchment and the Waikato<br>you've already seen from Arama all of<br>these things that are happening here<br>contribute to that River and the nature<br>of that River the catchment reflects the<br>land the geology the erosion the<br>steepness or otherwise<br>it reflects the activities in that land<br>the nature of the businesses that go on<br>the pastoral farming the livestock that<br>are kept there and their interactions<br>with the river it reflects the weather<br>and the extremes of climate and it<br>impacts on us directly in those ways and<br>when we interact directly with that<br>River we experience all of those<br>interactions now a river is a product of<br>a water cycle water is stored in oceans<br>and in the atmosphere when it condenses<br>and falls as rain or snow it moves into<br>groundwater systems or surface water<br>systems and ultimately collects in the<br>bottom of its catchment and flows<br>downhill towards the sea and that flow<br>downhill is our River now we stick a lot<br>of stuff in these catchments and those<br>as I said modify the way in which that<br>River will develop the nature of the<br>water in that River we extract water<br>from groundwater for irrigation that<br>changes the water supply to that River<br>we dam those rivers for energy supply<br>for water supply for irrigation we carry<br>out our agriculture we introduce animals<br>onto those land around those rivers and<br>they contribute to the change in<br>nutrient supplies and so forth and then<br>there's all our urban activities of<br>water supply water extraction wastewater<br>collection discharge of wastes and<br>treatment and of course stormwater don't<br>forget that some of these are point<br>sources of contamination the dirt that<br>marimow so beautifully described to you<br>some of them uh diffuse and harder to<br>get a handle on harder to understand<br>what that contribution ism where it's<br>coming from now so what's the state of<br>our rivers now ministry for the<br>environment and States New Zealand had<br>very conveniently given us this<br>extremely easy to use and see<br>example of how our rivers are now this<br>was the result of some work done by a<br>number of groups and allowed the thought<br>that went to MSE that I'll talk about a<br>little more first of all consented water<br>takes 51% of the consented water is<br>taken for irrigation water applied to<br>land to enhance the growth of our crops<br>mostly grass for cows some for drinking<br>some for industry and some for whatever<br>that ever those other purposes are which<br>we might have what do we know our<br>industries are leading to an increase in<br>nutrient supply an increase in nitrogen<br>leaching through the soil into water<br>twenty-nine percent increase over the<br>last 15 or so years in terms of River<br>sites monitored and this is about 234<br>sites that are monitored here nitrogen<br>is getting worse nitrogen levels getting<br>worse than 55 percent of them at least<br>and half of that are we seeing an<br>improvement phosphorus on the other hand<br>getting a bit better more improvement<br>than worsening but where something is<br>still happening and what about our urban<br>rivers I was talking to an urban river<br>scientist or stream scientist yesterday<br>and I asked her what she thought was<br>happening with their urban rivers she<br>said well there's stuffed and I hear<br>that a lot not much hope for some of our<br>urban rivers eco low levels it's an<br>indicator of the health risk you expose<br>yourself to if you contact that 22 times<br>higher than a natural River in a<br>uncontaminated environment or a forest<br>environment nitrogen much higher<br>phosphorus as well not a good picture<br>this data came from a paper by Scott<br>lament or a report by Scott Loudon and<br>his team at Nemo who sent that through<br>to the ministry for the environment and<br>what they did was put together some<br>models based on water quality data and<br>land use so that they could predict<br>across the country<br>nutrients in this case total nitrogen<br>how to interpret this figure darker<br>colors are higher levels of nitrogen<br>lighter colors are lower levels you can<br>see that those less impacted areas of<br>New Zealand that we would recognize as<br>less impacted have lower nitrogen levels<br>everywhere where we have a lot of<br>fertilized agriculture we see high<br>levels of nitrogen the black coloring<br>what about health risk as measured by E<br>coli pretty similar picture here not<br>quite as intense but not a whole lot of<br>difference and what about ecological<br>values this is based on an MCI index<br>again lighter colors better darker<br>colors OS MCI index measures the insect<br>communities and the invertebrate<br>communities in a stream and really uses<br>those as a measure of how healthy their<br>ecosystem is again and those<br>well-developed areas of New Zealand the<br>picture is pretty bleak and of course I<br>worry a lot about swimming water quality<br>and because you are Hawk lenders<br>probably or living here for the moment<br>you worry about water quality in<br>swimming as well don't you we don't have<br>a lot of rivers in the area our lakes<br>are pretty good but the picture around<br>our rivers poor at best fear and our<br>land covers been changing so in this<br>time frame here that come from the lower<br>database 1996 through 2012 we're seeing<br>a bit of change more urbanization a lot<br>more exotic forestry less native forests<br>Leafs native scrublands I've got less<br>exotic grassland that's transferred to<br>forestry so change is occurring in this<br>case a little more slowly but we're in a<br>situation where we have a problem with<br>our water quality in our rivers we have<br>a problem with the ecosystems and our<br>rivers and we know about that we've<br>described<br>that really well and in fact we've known<br>about it since I was a child we've known<br>about that for my entire career and<br>that's why I'm a freshwater scientist so<br>let's look for it why is this going to<br>go is it going to get any better well<br>I've become pretty apparent that the<br>thing we've got driving our problems<br>here is people it's us the things that<br>we expect like power I had power up for<br>a whole week man that's hard am I going<br>to phone the panels you bet and our<br>population is increasing now mostly<br>probably in urban areas probably in the<br>North Island probably in those places<br>where we know our water quality is worse<br>stats tells us that by 2030 the<br>population will be more like five and a<br>half million a few more people we've got<br>to fit into this in this area and a bit<br>more business to manage a lot more<br>people to support and we're still just<br>as far away from the rest of the world<br>as we were before what about the<br>prospect for those primary industries<br>which covers so much of the surface of<br>our land<br>well MPI looked ahead and did some<br>projections through deworm 2020 or so<br>and what do they think animal numbers<br>and production of meat and dairy and<br>we'll likely to stay relatively stable<br>can't see a lot of change going on they<br>sit in these areas what else<br>increasing horticulture and aquaculture<br>and that might be aquaculture on land<br>and tanks which will reporter supply and<br>recirculation of water and good quality<br>water horticulture is going to require<br>more irrigation what about fertilizer<br>surely that's getting more expensive<br>back when I was a child and than that oh<br>yeah oh no when I was at university in<br>the 1970s the government took subsidies<br>off fertilizer made a massive difference<br>to our water quality<br>that you to occasion I observed dropped<br>away because sudden it was too expensive<br>to put fertilizer on all over the place<br>is that like either heaven again well no<br>probably not<br>in this timeframe fertilizer productions<br>increasing usage is increasing the price<br>is likely not to be a big driver in<br>terms of this usage forestry production<br>has increased rapidly over the last few<br>years since 2015 we've seen a massive<br>increase and forest production the<br>number of logs that have been sold and<br>and milled and part of that is because<br>the price is being bitter the few trees<br>around my place that might not be here<br>much longer but I'll be able to pull out<br>it's the forestry production they also<br>projected predict that farmers will<br>good and in fact what does that mean<br>we're gonna see them scuffing around<br>their paddocks in another manner it'll<br>be very good and they're gonna be<br>holding on to their checkbooks like you<br>wouldn't believe<br>actually what it does mean is that<br>there's now a whole bunch of farming<br>systems available and supported by the<br>companies who are interested in these<br>kinds of things like Fonterra<br>like darienne's it like the balanced<br>fertilizer where they're really<br>interested in designing systems whole<br>farm systems which integrate weather<br>information with soil information with<br>farming practice and with the need to<br>rotate stock or row grass or whatever<br>they need to be able to improve both<br>waste disposal water use and fertilizer<br>applications so there's some pretty<br>sophisticated tools being developed<br>which will really make a difference to<br>some of these things that's what they<br>so that's I think a good sign what else<br>is going to change<br>well what about climate big systems that<br>we can't influence in the way that we<br>can the output of a farm or the quality<br>of a stream and a poll in The Herald a<br>few weeks ago said oh well we don't<br>think that we'll be able to overcome<br>this climate challenge because there's<br>crazy guys with orange here in other<br>parts of the world who are big-time<br>deniers some of those trees at my place<br>are because of this that have a problem<br>at the moment this storm so we expect to<br>see sea level rise climate change more<br>storms more droughts more problems all<br>of these are going to affect our rivers<br>let's have a look at some of those<br>climate change models and what they're<br>telling us within the time frame this is<br>data from neewa putting together an<br>average of the climate change models and<br>using some of the West's scenarios<br>because it's those worst scenarios that<br>seem to be panning out at the moment<br>2025 this is difference from now darker<br>green means a bit of change in<br>temperature lighter green means more<br>change in temperature so by 2030 we're<br>going to be seeing an increase in<br>temperature of one and a half to two<br>degrees maybe in our mountainous regions<br>that affects things like snowpack and<br>spring melts and that water supply and<br>it's going to be warm for all of us if<br>we look out to 20 90 the end of the<br>century then warming continues and we're<br>getting into the two and a half to three<br>and a little more degrees change and<br>what about rainfall similar kinds of<br>scenarios over the next period what do<br>we see increase rainfall but small<br>amounts over much of the country and<br>less rain in those rain shadow areas on<br>as we progress towards the end of the<br>century that just increases and the West<br>Coast gets wetter and wetter it's going<br>to be much more exciting in the<br>waterfalls except you might not be able<br>to see them for their constant rain now<br>this is me over annual means if you<br>think about seasonal change that's<br>happening as well and in fact we saw a<br>very different year 2017-18 then we've<br>seen before temperature wise and<br>rainfall wise and what are we seeing now<br>in our rainfall or what are we likely to<br>see with climate change in our rainfall<br>Springs will spring will be drier in the<br>north and in the east of the South<br>Island I have no idea it's going to get<br>wetter and that's in their summer and<br>into the autumn and the far north it's<br>likely to be and it's alright now I'm a<br>perfectly fine it stop now and ok where<br>were we ok<br>winter in the summer in the North dryer<br>in the summer and parts of the south<br>autumns will be drier in the lower North<br>Island and into the South Island but<br>still winter in our part of the world<br>and on into winter where there'll be<br>some drier areas in the East but on the<br>whole it's looking pretty weak so that's<br>just in the next time frame if we look<br>through until the end of the century the<br>situation is quite different much drier<br>in the spring summer a bit dry wetter in<br>the autumn in our part of the world and<br>building up really wet down himself and<br>them at our River is going to be<br>powering down what's the likely effect<br>of all that on river flows here's some<br>more new wide data increase river flows<br>on the west coast and in the mountains<br>regions of the South Island but those<br>smaller rivers and streams on the East<br>Coast will be a lot drier in the North<br>Island and our region we would expect<br>our River flows to be a lot less and in<br>some parts of Hawke's Bay perhaps those<br>will dry up altogether so some big<br>changes ahead for our rivers in terms of<br>the effects of climate now being<br>painting a picture that looks a bit like<br>this for a catchment pretty dire and<br>there's not what we want that can't be<br>where we're going that was where we were<br>going back in the nineteen sixties and<br>seventies this is where we want to go<br>where we are able to meet the needs of<br>our communities and our cities and our<br>businesses without impacting too badly<br>on our rivers so that we can develop a<br>balance between the needs of a river and<br>the needs of the community okay so where<br>do we sit across the spectrum murmur<br>already mentioned the national of the<br>missouri the resource manager of a<br>national policy statement for fresh<br>water and that since having been drawn<br>up about 2014 that sits within the<br>resource management act Resource<br>Management Act has been with us since<br>1991 when I was at university doing my<br>PhD actually we've had guidelines<br>developed and promulgated from that<br>sense but it's not until more recently<br>very recently that the national policy<br>statements been developed along with<br>that we have guidelines for ecological<br>and cultural management and we have<br>microbiological water guidelines and we<br>got a bunch of other guidelines that go<br>with that now that's what's happening<br>from the crown they've seen this problem<br>coming a long way out because we tell<br>they can see it they're not stupid and<br>they've had to balance what we could do<br>for our environment with what we can do<br>for our businesses and our economics the<br>regional councils that we created along<br>with that Resource Management Act were<br>given a responsibility and environmental<br>management so they've been working on<br>that since about 1991 as well and those<br>regional councils were originally<br>designed on catchments so they were<br>responsible for an area which covered<br>the inputs to a group of rivers so<br>control was possible no longer were they<br>divided on rivers as districts had used<br>to be so we were thinking more systems<br>orientated more integrated Lee now the<br>national policy statement on freshwater<br>has given those councils a lot of<br>responsibility so they have to consider<br>economic environmental social and<br>cultural well-being with equal relevance<br>in their considerations and they have to<br>design strategies for meeting those<br>expectations by 2025 so within the<br>timeline of this rivers 2030<br>consideration now supporting all of this<br>and underpinning it and of course is<br>research research done in the sea our<br>eyes like near on link here who were<br>research done in universities like our<br>own and we have this extensive River<br>research and of course done an intimate<br>Dunnan private Institute's like the<br>course or an institute<br>now this precipitated a little bit along<br>the track responses from industry groups<br>and business who started to say well<br>actually we've got some responsibilities<br>and all this as well and well perhaps<br>their responses have been a bit dodgy on<br>occasions and we've been quite fickle<br>than how we might recognize them from<br>Tehran during use darienne's it have<br>both tried to develop environmental<br>understand<br>and some environmental processes they're<br>supporting riparian planting and fencing<br>of streams for example which is a really<br>positive thing so there is and has been<br>what's different now what's different<br>now is good thing is my last slide<br>almost what's different now is that<br>we're starting to get this other part of<br>the cycle sorted so we're seeing changes<br>in farming and business practice that<br>nimble response which enhances economics<br>and environmental sustainability it's<br>starting to become visible we've got<br>research which is not only locked up in<br>the research organizations and feeding<br>government but it's sitting out here as<br>public facing information things like<br>that page one pager from the ministry<br>for the environment there's a bunch of<br>community empowerment occurring where<br>there's you know you've probably heard<br>of the way you might not have heard of<br>the snack pack from they were which<br>provides a whole lot of simple water<br>testing kit to community groups and<br>their citizen science where people<br>become involved in projects and there's<br>a lot of water projects involved with<br>citizen science coordinated by<br>scientists within institutions such as<br>universities and what is this done this<br>has led to individuals to eWEEK to<br>communities becoming really engaged in<br>how this change might occur and this is<br>incredibly positive because when you<br>engage people individuals being change<br>really happens everything is in place<br>when you get the people on board then<br>things really move and here's an example<br>of how that happens I had the advantage<br>sure the honor I suppose of being one of<br>the judges of the New Zealand rivers<br>award last year and the supreme of 2016<br>I guess<br>perhaps that's not last year the supreme<br>winner from that was this guy David<br>Croft and his group the Parral river<br>enhancement group now they're in South<br>Canterbury<br>it's an irrigated crop farming area<br>pastoral farming and cropping and they<br>used to use a surface flow irrigation<br>methodology alder diking and it's not<br>very efficient<br>it doesn't use water well and it carries<br>a lot of nutrients from fertilizer into<br>rivers the paha River was getting really<br>really into a very poor state highly<br>enriched and the e.coli levels were<br>extremely high this group of farmers sat<br>down and said you know we're gonna be in<br>big trouble they're gonna start stopping<br>us farming if we don't do something<br>about this so they got together and<br>started looking at what they could<br>achieve and the council the Regional<br>Council helped them with us they set<br>some nutrient rules they trained these<br>farmers or assisted them and taking a<br>systems approach and thinking how this<br>would work and ultimately now we see<br>that the arrival was the most improved<br>and this year and David's the<br>coordinator of that group and his wife<br>told me when I was talking to her he<br>spends most of the time after dinner on<br>the phone and he's getting on to them<br>and he's saying look I saw your irrigate<br>is going when they shouldn't have been<br>going you're not following the system<br>and it's people like this maybe your<br>business is a better and they feel<br>really good about what they've achieved<br>in that River because their<br>grandchildren can swim in that now so<br>I'm pretty positive about where we're<br>going with this I think we've got all<br>the pieces of the puzzle in place it's<br>just a matter of making sure they sit<br>tidally this is a community group out<br>where I live and they've been working on<br>water quality this summer and I've been<br>helping them with that and as far as I<br>can but it's their project now most of<br>these people are retired some of them<br>are enthusiastically younger by 2030<br>I'll be retired I'll be well retired by<br>then<br>I look forward to being a part of one of<br>these groups and we'll be working on<br>water quality and we'll be looking at<br>the information that's available to us<br>from the ministries and we'll be seeing<br>a real improvement it'll take a while to<br>come through but I think we're on the<br>way<br>I think I think the best way to start<br>the sort of end result is for people<br>like Jillian and I to talk to one<br>another at the very early stages of a<br>project and I work at the James here not<br>a research center and my colleagues are<br>sitting right here here's my<br>cheerleaders and the thing about us is<br>that we work with all of the faculties<br>at this university and there's another<br>colleague over there Jason Ingham and<br>he's the head of civil engineering and<br>he's got another colleague next term<br>trimmer knuckle and what we do is we<br>start working on projects from their<br>Genesis and so is that we get<br>understanding amongst one another and of<br>course now at the University we are<br>burdened by what's known as vision<br>Marton that we are all research projects<br>whether it be going through the Royal<br>Society in be a national science<br>challenge or one of the centres of<br>research excellence needs to look at how<br>projects are going to affect Maori New<br>Zealanders and so it's in the best<br>interests of researchers who are wanting<br>you know the best interests of<br>researchers to actually work with Maori<br>colleagues otherwise you won't get any<br>money that's a real reason to work with<br>us um but also there have been studies<br>in the past done by people like Dame<br>Evelyn Stokes and Dame Joan Mitch who<br>have actually proven that working with<br>Maori and Maori knowledge or Martina is<br>just as viable as scientific knowledge<br>and together it actually enriches the<br>experience as and enhances the overall<br>learning but we got to talk to one<br>another and feel that we're coming in on<br>an equal level you know I know she's a<br>professor so she is more but and I would<br>comment that I think that we're in the<br>right place now we're tamanna ot Y is<br>not so different than what our<br>communities are thinking I think there's<br>a really huge similarity here<br>it's a matter of making sure that the<br>language between you come I know we<br>worked on together so I just wondered<br>what you think my custom well the<br>settlement for the Waikato River<br>actually happened in 2009 originally and<br>at that time we would know they were<br>Waikato and the other tribes along the<br>way kata Robert because there are many<br>had their own aspirations about what<br>they wanted for the river and the way<br>they framed the river was always to talk<br>about it Darnell windy anyway as a to<br>Pune as an ancestor but Maori from the<br>fauna Nui river had a different idea<br>about what they wanted for the river and<br>I think a lot of that has to do with the<br>amount of Industry and dependence there<br>is on the Waikato River for River for<br>watering you know in Auckland and the<br>aspirations of Maori on the Waikato<br>River are quite different than the<br>aspirations for Maori along the phone or<br>over and given the ten year break<br>between the two settlements of call<br>is going to be different motivations and<br>aspirations but even now there is no<br>talk about the Waikato River getting<br>personhood it's not something that our<br>tribes are aiming for they want water<br>allocations and ownership of water and<br>that's what they're more interested in<br>rather than tuning a river into a person<br>so it just depends on what you want as<br>an a we working in that community space<br>I just love that idea that meta<br>I thought it was really interesting some<br>of it is about a species<br>what is it ribbit anyway they may have<br>babies and Christian I asked around this<br>kind of land where the river is adopted<br>water has just this kind of ancient<br>water as a substance whether or not that<br>kind of mission is out and I think we<br>saw this analogous Latian it actually<br>has a bit of a richer thinking what the<br>rivet is banking that kind of shifting<br>baseline we used to be so guess the<br>question is do you think we can be doing<br>more work to kind of understanding so<br>when you say to Poona the 2.0 means<br>everything so if I frame it using that<br>Maori word to preneur that actually<br>means the riverbanks the saying the<br>yields that even the people it's it's<br>inclusive of everything and that's why<br>those fundamental Maori concepts in the<br>way of seeing water bodies are really<br>important to Maori so those distinctions<br>don't separate River and even within<br>Maori there are a number of words for<br>water that classify all the different<br>types of water while Maori why key no<br>wait a tie you know that we really have<br>got the classification of water on high<br>ab and that's because it's so important<br>and i would suggest that the more that<br>we begin to understand them to<br>incorporate Murray thinking into the way<br>we place our or build our legislation<br>and build our policies and our<br>guidelines but closer we become to<br>actually wiping out those barriers you<br>know we recognize catchments now we<br>recognise their functional systems we<br>recognise these systems rather than<br>individual components and that's come a<br>long way back from where we've been and<br>and we don't have a lot of leaks and<br>that helps we also use our lakes for<br>water supply so they're protected we<br>operate on a protected catchment concept<br>where we protect those catchments we<br>retain those lakes within forested areas<br>specifically to protect water quality so<br>that's part of where some of our lakes<br>are good others of our lakes are quite<br>volcanic and they're fed by groundwater<br>not by surface water and that water is<br>generally of a lot higher quality than<br>as the surface water that's contaminated<br>by stormwater predominantly and it's<br>stormwater that's the real problem here<br>because the effectors are buildup of<br>heavy metals of toxicants of various<br>sorts and it's quite hard to get rid of<br>I think it started in a lot of little<br>places it's hard to say to a community<br>group actually you need to care about<br>this person's water over here and the<br>same way that that Maremma described the<br>difference between different groups<br>within Maori so you know individual<br>groups can look after their piece of<br>water if their region and there's more<br>and more and more groups and the<br>integration between those or they you<br>know the connection between those seems<br>like it will probably get better but<br>this is a patchwork and I think it will<br>always be a patchwork because people do<br>care about their own patch and they kid</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
