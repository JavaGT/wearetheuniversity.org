Most people with addiction unfortunately relapse after successful treatment due to craving, stress and cues. <br><br>Non-invasive brain stimulation and brain implants target the abnormal brain activity and connectivity in the brain associated with craving and distress, thereby reinventing psychosurgery, but now based on the known neurobiology and neurophysiology involved in craving and

Medicine<br>standing in for the Dean professor Barry<br>Taylor who is ill and unable to be here<br>today but it's my great pleasure to be<br>able to introduce these two very<br>impressive professors and a student<br>who's also doing some work in this area<br>working with working with Duke so<br>Doretta who is the neurological<br>foundation chair in neurosurgery i has<br>been doing some wonderful work with<br>brains and neuromodulation and the<br>circuits in the brain and the impact on<br>various illnesses including addiction<br>which is the subject of today's talk and<br>professor paul blue hazel Buckland chair<br>and psychological medicine and here at<br>the department of psychological medicine<br>who is a very eminent<br>psychopharmacologist and very interested<br>in the biological basis of all of these<br>forgotten your first names<br>sue sue cling Leo who is working with<br>Victoria is going to also present to us<br>today and they are going to very shortly<br>a swage my craving for new knowledge<br>which may be an addiction and perhaps<br>they're going to tell us about about<br>that and just to start things off one of<br>the eminent psychoanalytic theorists<br>Carl Jung said every form of addiction<br>is bad no matter whether the narcotic<br>could be alcohol or morphine or idealism<br>and Somerset Maugham the unfortunate<br>thing about this world is that good<br>habits are so much easier to give up<br>than bad ones in Mark Twain I think says<br>it all however quitting smoking is the<br>I've done it hundreds of times John<br>thank you very much that very very fine<br>introduction and we've had the that the<br>introductions done already but I think<br>as this talk goes through one of the<br>things to reflect on is that this is a<br>lovely example of synergy between<br>departments of when you when you mix a<br>number of disciplines together the the<br>the outcomes can be much more than a sum<br>of the parts so I'm going to start off<br>by giving up a brief history of<br>addiction and how we how we<br>conceptualize it and treat it so if we<br>were to go back 1,000 years or so in<br>temperate use of alcohol was really seen<br>as a moral disorder or set and it wasn't<br>until the start of the Industrial<br>Revolution where you get a primarily<br>rural population moving into cities<br>where you get alcohol being produced on<br>industrial scales we're suddenly<br>physician so this is Benjamin Rush in<br>the states are looking at heavy alcohol<br>use and thinking that the safety is and<br>the moral thought this is this is a<br>medical problem and as one of the ways<br>of managing this was to open up big<br>asylums this was a standard way of<br>dealing with mental health problems and<br>in this case they would set up<br>institutions for inebriates<br>and and the the image on the slide is<br>the first one set up in the States and<br>Binghampton<br>Binghamton New York and there were lots<br>of temperance organizations that were<br>being set up to try and deal with moral<br>and social problems of drinking things<br>really then changed in the mid twentieth<br>century where suddenly the the medical<br>model started to look at this<br>alcoholism as a chronic disease and an<br>jelinek who is a US researcher was very<br>prominent in this and then probably the<br>biggest piece of work came from Griffith<br>woods and Milton gross in the mid 1970s<br>where they they pulled a lot of research<br>together so was this was not a<br>philosophical approach this was based on<br>real science and observation of patients<br>where they came up with the concept<br>the alcohol dependence syndrome this is<br>then mutated into the World Health<br>Organization guidelines on drug<br>dependence and has influenced the dsm-5<br>and and the elements that they picked up<br>there the narrowing of the drinking were<br>portrayal and other things really a sort<br>of key key elements that alcoholism<br>isn't just a single component there are<br>there are multiple changes in behavior<br>in thinking the concepts of Robert<br>Cloninger who's a psychiatrist who still<br>I think alive in the states who come up<br>with the idea of type 1 and type 2<br>alcoholics so it wasn't that you just<br>had people who met a certain number of<br>criteria that the type ones which he<br>thought were much more common were<br>primarily people who were drinking to<br>self-medicate I've got I've got a lot of<br>anxiety I've got a depression I'm not<br>coping alcohol suddenly takes away a lot<br>of these things and the type twos with a<br>link this worth part of an antisocial<br>lifestyle and and these are primarily<br>males who use alcohol as a sort of a<br>very drug-fueled lifestyle if we look at<br>how the diagnostic criteria in the<br>states have changed this in one came out<br>in the 1950s and basically said<br>alcoholism is just another feature of<br>antisocial personality disorder um and<br>as DSM two came along they said well<br>maybe it is also associated with<br>depression or anxiety or other<br>conditions diem three nineteen eighty<br>suddenly became a diagnosis in its own<br>right but it was split into abuse and<br>dependence and presumably one reflects a<br>less hazardous use than the other but it<br>was really impossible to say what's<br>what's the actual dividing line between<br>abuse and dependence and then DC m5<br>finally got rid of the the dichotomy of<br>abuse and dependence came up with a<br>single diagnostic category with severity<br>and specifies and this is what the dsm-5<br>criteria look like and we have four<br>domains and pain control social<br>impairment risky use of pharmacological<br>dependence you have eleven items within<br>those four domains<br>and the more criteria you meet the more<br>severe your substance use disorder is so<br>how do we treat drug and alcohol<br>dependence most certainly for alcohol<br>the main approaches are psychological<br>and social so we have kids here in<br>Dunedin and we have a a across New<br>Zealand we have group programs immersion<br>programs like the bridge program Mumbai<br>the Salvation Army we have Nancy Reagan<br>who quite hopefully in the 1980s said<br>just say no we fought for things besides<br>alcohol we do have other pharmacological<br>strategy so if you're dependent on<br>opioids you can get switched to<br>methadone or buprenorphine other<br>substitution agents for smoking<br>benzodiazepine should work as a<br>substitution for alcohol but they don't<br>if you take alcoholics and put them on<br>benzos they stay on the benzos and<br>continue to drink and we have some anti<br>craving medications we have aversive<br>medications none of them are<br>particularly effective so I'd like to<br>come back to the to the dsm-5 substance<br>use criteria so if one looked at the top<br>line we're simply the more items that<br>you can tick off the more severe your<br>substance use disorder is my feeling is<br>that not all of these are created equal<br>and the data that Duke and suckling are<br>going to present today suggests that XE<br>craving plays a huge role that you may<br>be able to switch off an enormous amount<br>of both alcohol appetite as well as<br>alcohol consumption by switching off<br>craving and so although I'm not<br>suggesting that dsm sex is going to say<br>craving and nothing else I think that<br>the idea of balancing out some of these<br>criteria may be an important conceptual<br>change so what is craving at its<br>simplest terms that's a strong ridge to<br>consume whatever your substance of<br>choices and it's not a unitary<br>phenomenon so it can have both positive<br>feelings when I have that glass of wine<br>it's going to make me feel so relaxed it<br>could be to overcome negative feelings<br>I'm feeling anxious so I need a glass of<br>wine or I'm having some withdrawal<br>symptoms<br>first thing when I wake up in the<br>mornings I need to have a glass of wine<br>just so I can start out the day these<br>these can happen spontaneously this can<br>happen in the background but you can<br>also elicit them by internal or external<br>keys and some of the data you'll see<br>today is when you're showing Alcoholics<br>images of people drinking images of say<br>alcoholic beverages you can see relevant<br>brain areas lighting up things to do it<br>areas to do with craving or salience and<br>areas to do with reward so where do we<br>treat addiction it's prevalent it's<br>expensive and it's a social burden and<br>if we look at prevalence in the top<br>three rows we've got tobacco and alcohol<br>that are are still legal and we also<br>have illicit drugs and the dependence on<br>things that are easily easily available<br>is much much higher rather than illicit<br>drugs we have relatively high rates of<br>dependence depending on on what<br>substances we're looking at so cannabis<br>dependence is relatively uncommon<br>compared will say dependence on heroin<br>or cocaine or stimulants and it's<br>expensive one of the things that we do<br>when we see patients coming into the<br>acute ward where I work is looking at<br>what their substance use and tails in<br>terms of financial outlay and how<br>they're managing this and and often it<br>means that either family resources are<br>getting poured into this or people are<br>having to steal things do sex work sell<br>drugs in order to make their around to<br>meet their habits and and the the<br>numbers when you when you look at at<br>some population costs for substance of<br>abuse are just jaw-dropping it's a major<br>social burden and and these are us data<br>from from about 18 years ago<br>that's looking at the proportion of<br>arrestees who were involved with some<br>sort of crime these are different New<br>York states and we see huge association<br>with<br>crime child abuse theft property crimes<br>ends and drug-dealing<br>so is it curable the it's certainly<br>possible to drive people out it's<br>certainly possible to to look at what<br>may be driving people to drink and and<br>the the biggest changes challenge is not<br>drawing people out of stopping their<br>consumption that's actually managing<br>relapse and you again<br>based based on the some British study<br>probably close to 85% of people worth<br>with existing alcohol use disorders<br>who've dried out will start drinking<br>again at some point and and the three<br>key elements that have been identified<br>are craving so the craving doesn't<br>necessarily go away even though people<br>are sober alcohol cues and stress and<br>and we've we've taken an approach where<br>if we we can look at craving and stress<br>we can't do away with the the TUI<br>billboards or wine advertisements and<br>and supermarkets but we can perhaps<br>manage craving and stress as therapeutic<br>targets do in order to to try and<br>develop a treatment for in order to try<br>and and develop a treatment for brain<br>based treatment for addiction it's<br>important to try and understand well how<br>does the brain work and how can we then<br>modify craving can we modify a sense of<br>sensitivity to cues and can we modify a<br>stress response so from a conceptual<br>point of view the brain is actually a<br>prediction machine that's its<br>fundamental function as to predict<br>what's going to happen and this is<br>essential once a moving multicellular<br>creatures start moving around in the<br>environment and in order to do that in<br>order to make those predictions those<br>multicellular creatures start using<br>information from previous experiences<br>which we call memory so that it can<br>better predict what's going to happen<br>for example if you drink a glass of<br>I might feel more relaxed or if I'm<br>going to go behind the corner I might<br>meet some something to eat or might meet<br>a potential partner and of course what<br>you predict is based on the cousin what<br>is stored in memory but also on the<br>current context always related to<br>yourself but ultimately the fundamental<br>goal of the brain is to reduce inherent<br>uncertainty which is embedded embedded<br>in a changing environment and this is of<br>course important from a Darwinistic<br>point of view both for survival and for<br>procreation so from a conceptual point<br>of view the brain the brain is consists<br>of different modules and those different<br>modules are connected to each other and<br>interact it doesn't mean that if one<br>module is active that the other module<br>is also becoming active they can be<br>anti-correlated where if one module is<br>active the other becomes inactive which<br>for example is normal when we're in a<br>default mode state which means we're<br>mind-wandering we're resting and<br>digesting then when we're thinking about<br>the past in the future when somebody<br>calls your name or calls fire something<br>in your brain has to tell you well I<br>have to pay attention to this new<br>external input rather than continue to<br>mind wander and so one the the salience<br>network which tells you something is<br>behaviorally relevant is happening<br>becomes activated then it down it shuts<br>down the mind-wandering default mode<br>network and or that you can pay<br>attention to the external stimulus that<br>being said there is also an interaction<br>between those two networks one which<br>says this is behavior relevant and that<br>has to drive the the other Network to<br>shut down and more likely than the other<br>way around so you have driving networks<br>and networks that are being driven and<br>of course this information all has to<br>integrate into another network which is<br>called the binding Network functionally<br>or the rich Club anatomically where all<br>the information that you are experience<br>at the same time becomes integrating it<br>into<br>integrate into one unified percept now<br>from a practical point of view there is<br>two very very important networks in the<br>brain one which is called the salience<br>network and the other one which is<br>called the default mode Network the<br>salience network consists of the<br>anterior cingulate and the which you can<br>see right here the anterior cingulate as<br>well as the anterior insula and<br>basically the salience network just tell<br>you something behaviorally relevant is<br>happening in the environment the Sainz<br>network is also involved in craving and<br>as overlaps partially with the central<br>components of the sympathetic nervous<br>system which is which of course is the<br>system that is involved in fight flight<br>feed and fornicate response is basically<br>the sympathetic nervous system is what<br>allows you to respond to a stimulus in<br>the external environment and therefore<br>it also drives your attention towards<br>what is happening in the environment so<br>on the one hand you've got the salience<br>network on the other hand you've got the<br>default mode Network and this is based<br>on the neuro sent meta-analysis of 627<br>studies whereas the saint's network was<br>on a smaller number meta analysis of a<br>smaller number of studies but so the<br>default mode network involves<br>predominantly Dupree general anterior<br>cingulate and the posterior and the<br>medial part of the brain as an is a self<br>referential network so every stimulus<br>that occurs internally or externally has<br>to be related to yourself and refer to<br>the self and this is one of the main<br>functions of the default mode network<br>and this is involved more in lighting as<br>we will see later and overlaps with the<br>parasympathetic system which of course<br>is a system that helps you to rest<br>restore yourself and to digest so when<br>you're not having to pay attention to<br>the outside world and you start<br>mind-wandering<br>then basically your default mode network<br>becomes active in a default mode is<br>there is linked to the memory Network<br>which of course you need in order to be<br>able to start mind wandering<br>now to switch between the satans Network<br>and the default mode is most likely the<br>area where they overlap which is the nd<br>posterior segment area as you can see<br>right right here so from a practical<br>point of view those two very important<br>brain networks interact where if one is<br>up the other one is down and the other<br>way around so the salience network to<br>put it very simple says something is<br>behavior irrelevant and in general tells<br>you that you need to inquire acquire<br>more information in order to pay more<br>detail to the information that might be<br>relevant to the current situation so<br>what happens is one the salience network<br>is active you get an urge for action<br>irrespective of which kind of action and<br>it will also create the sympathetic<br>activation response so the the for F's<br>and it will reset your reference in<br>order to be able to extract more<br>information from the environment so<br>basically your gain and your brain will<br>go will go down so that it's more easy<br>to detect whatever stimuli occur in the<br>environment<br>now this resetting of this gain which is<br>also called a low status and contrast to<br>hope to homeostasis also involved<br>actually the and the default mode<br>network which basically tells you all is<br>quiet at about from I can sit and rest<br>and digest and I've got enough stimuli<br>basically also suggesting that you can<br>activate your parasympathetic system and<br>that you already have enough information<br>to control the current environment and<br>therefore it can suppress any further<br>input so whereas on the one hand the<br>saint's network well in crete will<br>decrease your gain so you can extract<br>more information from the environment<br>and it will drive you to look for more<br>information the the default mode will do<br>the opposite that will make you that<br>will make it possible for you to rest on<br>digest and to actually to suppress<br>further input which would be irrelevant<br>anyway we<br>you already know how to control the<br>environment so if you summarize that in<br>a very simple model what you see is that<br>the that the area and the brain and this<br>is a little bit phrenological because<br>it's actually a network but the hub of<br>that network is in the Russell into your<br>singlet and in a meta-analysis as you<br>can see here of close to 100 studies you<br>see that this area and the Russell into<br>you're saying that tells you there is<br>uncertainty uncertainty meaning you<br>don't have enough information about the<br>environment to make next decision so if<br>you don't have enough information for<br>what is happening or occurring in<br>environment what you will do is you will<br>go it will urge you for an action to go<br>and look for missing information and<br>this is then controlled by a second help<br>very closely related and the dorsal part<br>of the anterior cingulate now then what<br>that will drive you to actively go and<br>explore the environment for more<br>information and if you have found the<br>missing information that will<br>subsequently activate the medial the<br>preacher on to your singlet which is<br>related to a dona pleasure so once your<br>brain extracts the missing information<br>that I've got all the information I need<br>now in order to continue then the yellow<br>area as you can see from the meta<br>analysis air will become activated and<br>that will create a feeling of pleasure<br>now if and on that moment you will<br>suppress further input and go into a<br>parasympathetic resting state and<br>basically the the item that solved the<br>missing and input will then be stored<br>into memory so you can use it next time<br>once you are in the same context in the<br>same situation now if you have enough<br>information then basically you will<br>inhibit action and that occurs in the<br>SMA area as you can see from this<br>meta-analysis so that will shut down<br>further exploring of the environment and<br>we'll help you to rest and digest if<br>however you do not get the missing<br>information enough you will basically go<br>into a kind of a vicious circle where<br>you will continue to activate this this<br>green part the dorsal part of into your<br>singlet which will drive you<br>to keep on looking for missing<br>information and this keeping on looking<br>for mission information<br>phenomenologically is expressed as<br>craving you it drives you it's an urge<br>to to look for whatever is missing<br>whether that is food whether that is sex<br>whether there's work whether that is<br>gambling it doesn't really matter<br>it's a nonspecific craving circuitry<br>that involves this part of this dorsal<br>to rustle part of the interior singlet<br>so basically in the brain everything is<br>controlled by a balance between salience<br>for external predominantly external<br>stimuli and say so what is behaviorally<br>relevant and what is behaviorally<br>irrelevant and this balance is in itself<br>associated with the sympathetic nervous<br>system and the attentional networks<br>whereas a default mode network will<br>suppress further input is associated<br>with parasympathetic activity and memory<br>related activity now this balance is<br>controlled most likely by our self<br>referential Network that will tell you I<br>need more or I have enough external<br>information so what does this have to do<br>with addiction well addiction in itself<br>is can be seen as a disease of the brain<br>just like you can use PET scans in order<br>to look at metabolism in the heart you<br>can use PET scans F MRIs EEG s to look<br>at brain activity related to addiction<br>so addiction is a brain disease just<br>like like other problems might be hard<br>or other diseases so we've we've tried<br>to elucidate what is a nonspecific<br>addiction circuitry in the brain which<br>involves unsurprisingly part of the<br>default mode and part of the of the<br>salience Network which are normally<br>decorrelated but what what an addiction<br>might be the problem is that they're out<br>of balance so when when input and<br>suppression of input are imbalanced<br>depending on the context and depending<br>on requirements actually an addiction<br>what you see is that there is a shift<br>where everything becomes salient related<br>to the specific part of what you're<br>addicted to so everything which is<br>related for example to alcohol<br>everything which is related to sex<br>everything which is related to cocaine<br>whatever product you're addicted to<br>becomes very salient and you almost<br>never go to this rest and digest state<br>where you can relax and sit back so at<br>actual addiction can actually be seen as<br>an imbalance between those two important<br>networks and in the brain now because<br>these networks have to communicate and<br>the brain the way different networks and<br>the brain communicate is by doing by<br>being anti synchronized or by being<br>synchronized and normally those two<br>areas the the default and the scenes are<br>as I mentioned anti synchronize which<br>you can see and this in this picture<br>where the blue the blue green areas are<br>basically the default mode and they're<br>anti sync anti-correlated to the<br>yellowish areas where you see the<br>anterior insula and the anterior<br>cingulate and involved an anti<br>correlated activity to the to each other<br>now what you see and what you see an<br>addiction is that actually those areas<br>between the posterior cingulate and the<br>preacher on tier saying that two areas<br>of the default mode actually become<br>synchronized with the dorsal part of the<br>anterior cingulate so your brain is<br>saying I have enough but I want more at<br>the same time and so if it doesn't know<br>what to do it will go for safety and<br>actually try to get more of the same<br>stimulus now we know that an addiction<br>people get pleasure at least short-term<br>pleasure from what day<br>from the substance of abuse whether it's<br>alcohol was cocaine whether it's Herren<br>doesn't matter and when we look at the<br>correlation analysis between the<br>pleasure they extract the people extract<br>from the stimulus in this case this was<br>food to the salience that they attach to<br>the food then this is this occurs and<br>everybody whether you're addicted or non<br>addicted for everybody in the audience<br>basically when you like somebody you<br>attach behavioral relevance to it or<br>when something is behavior behavior<br>relevant you might like it<br>furthermore a las casas or reference<br>resetting is something we all do when we<br>eat basically what's going to happen is<br>you're hungry you eat and progressively<br>your your brain tells you well I'm<br>getting all the energy that I that I<br>need so you will basically get less and<br>less pleasure from eating and you'll get<br>to society and if you continue eating<br>actually you get the opposite and you<br>start feeling nausea so this a low<br>status will drive craving will drive<br>craving and all of us however when we<br>look specifically at food people what<br>happens is that the behavioral relevant<br>the salience drives the craving and not<br>directly but indirectly via reference<br>resetting so what seems to occur the<br>brain of an addicted person is that the<br>behavioral relevance attached to the<br>stimulus whether that is cocaine alcohol<br>food sex it doesn't really matter that<br>will cause a reference resetting and<br>this reference resetting will drive you<br>craving but then the question is of<br>course where in the brain does that<br>happen because if we know where you're<br>resetting your reference where the<br>craving is controlled then we might use<br>that as a target for stimulation so if<br>you look at where it occurs basically<br>it's the PCC the posterior cingulate is<br>part of the default mode the self<br>referential setting that drives<br>predominantly the the the PCC drives the<br>anterior cingulate to say I want more<br>and pregel on tier soon and say I have<br>enough<br>but in a similar way and that might be<br>one of the causes of the craving problem<br>so where should we target what should we<br>use as a target in order to implant<br>electrodes or non-invasively stimulate<br>so what we ideally because as Paula said<br>what happens an addiction is that you<br>can treat addiction unfortunately most<br>of the people eight seventy five to<br>eighty five percent will relapse how can<br>we prevent this relapse<br>well relapse occurs because of craving<br>because of queues and because of stress<br>can refine one target that is involved<br>in the circuits for those three<br>phenomena craving based on a<br>meta-analysis is correlated to activity<br>actually in the and the Russell part of<br>the anterior cingulate and this is for<br>all kinds of substances of abuse here<br>more related to alcohol and more to food<br>so basically the which is of course as<br>you might remember the the central hub<br>of the sympathetic nervous system and is<br>the central hub of the salience network<br>and so craving could be targeted there<br>but craving could also be targeted and a<br>nucleus accumbens which is part of your<br>reward system that might give you a<br>feeling of reward when you when you or<br>predicts that your craving will be<br>reduced once you take the substance of<br>abuse now if you look at alcohol related<br>images then you activate not just this<br>part that is involved in craving but<br>also the self referential network so<br>both both the salience network as well<br>as the as default mode Network now when<br>you then look at a lot of different<br>stimuli whether it is whether it's<br>cannabis cocaine heroin nicotine sex<br>government doesn't really matter any<br>kind of stimulus will actually create a<br>response and the doors rostral dorsal<br>part of the interior cingulate as you<br>can see here and as well as the nucleus<br>accumbens so basically to air<br>that we can target based on craving and<br>based on accuse now when you then look<br>at stress where is stress<br>what's the stress Network in our brain<br>unsurprisingly<br>it's actually overlapping with the<br>sympathetic nervous system which is the<br>one that gives you the drive and there<br>you see that it is predominantly there's<br>rustle part of the interior singlet but<br>not the nucleus accumbens which is not<br>involved so basically in summary craving<br>pews alcohol rake leaves and stress the<br>three main causes for relapse overlap<br>and one target and that is the the<br>roster dorsal part of the anterior<br>cingulate which would be an idea for an<br>ideal target to to use by non-invasive<br>and invasive stimulation and to be more<br>specific it's it's the little blue spot<br>which is where responders and<br>non-responders<br>actually are different so in order to<br>now that we've got a target so Clayton<br>will actually now explain you how we try<br>in a non-invasive and invasive way try<br>to modulate this this unique target for<br>activated at either three days or 17<br>days post operation what followed was<br>shelf weeks of optimization of the<br>stimulation where we try to reduce their<br>craving which was measured on a<br>ten-point scale where zero was no<br>craving at all and 10 was improving the<br>most ever assessments were at 12 weeks<br>six months and shelf man's follow-up so<br>eight participants completed all<br>protocol related activities the primary<br>end point of the study was alcohol<br>craving and the secondary endpoints were<br>mood and adverse effects so as you can<br>see in this panel here as a group there<br>was a huge decrease in craving as well<br>as standard drinks per day when you<br>compare a pre stimulation to healthy<br>controls participants had an increased<br>active beta activity in the dorsal<br>anterior cingulate cortex when you<br>compare co-stimulation to pre<br>stimulation there was the decrease in<br>active eita activity in the dACC<br>although you see this drastic decrease<br>in craving and standard drinks two<br>participants relaxed at Chapman's<br>follow-up also most participants<br>continued drinking throughout the study<br>so when we asked why why that might<br>happen they say oh the drink we had more<br>control of the drinking so they could<br>stop when they wanted to also when us<br>they attributed the reason for drinking<br>to habit suggesting that this treatment<br>may actually control craving but not<br>habitual overconsumption of alcohol so<br>these are the secondary outcomes of the<br>study as expected there was a<br>significant decrease in craving as<br>measured by the validated alcohol<br>craving questionnaire now we also found<br>that there was a<br>decrease in depression obsession and<br>compulsive score however we did not find<br>any changes in state or trait anxiety<br>suggesting that these treatment may<br>benefit those who were drinking to<br>reduce depression or obsessive or<br>compulsive behavior but not for those<br>who drink to reduce anxiety these are<br>the adverse events of the study I'm not<br>going to read them out but what I'm<br>going to say is that none of these<br>adverse events were related to the<br>stimulation of the study they were<br>related to the surgery so the next study<br>I'm going to describe is a non-invasive<br>study aimed at exploring the effect of<br>high definition transcranial pink noise<br>stimulation of the dACC on food craving<br>so with so with traditional salon so<br>electrodes we are stimulating a very<br>large area of the cortical region and<br>50% of the current is being deflected by<br>the skull with HD or high-definition<br>electrodes you get to stimulate a more<br>precise area of the cortical region so<br>not on pink noise pink noise is a signal<br>where the power is inversely<br>proportional to the frequency so pink<br>noise resembles the natural naturally<br>occurring signals in the<br>self-organisation of brain networks in<br>this study we recruited 16 women they<br>all had a BMI of 30 or more and they got<br>three or more on the yellow food<br>addiction scale all wife s the wife s is<br>a validated measure of food addictions<br>similar to the dsm-5 for substance<br>addiction the primary outcome was<br>measured using a craving questionnaire<br>with what which was validated the fcq s<br>the secondary outcome of the study was<br>brain activity assessed you<br>Iggy's so the study was a six-week<br>randomized double-blind parallel study<br>we chose the parallel instead of the<br>cross over design because we did not<br>know how long the effect of HTTP NS the<br>last at baseline participants completed<br>the fcq s and we collect the EEG data<br>our participants had six sessions of<br>HTTP NS or placebo over a period of two<br>weeks in the the intervention group<br>received one ma of stimuli one milliamp<br>of stimulation for twenty minutes there<br>was also a sixty second ramp up period<br>so during this sixty seconds you feel a<br>little of itching under the electrodes<br>on your scalp and for the next twenty<br>minutes you actually do not feel any<br>sensation on your scalp so to replicate<br>that itching sensation the placebo group<br>also had a sixty second remote period<br>but then the stimulator was turned off<br>after that so there were no adverse<br>effects a site flop from that itching<br>slight itching sensation because of the<br>remote session and when we ask<br>participants post-intervention what what<br>did they think they received all of them<br>replied real treatment suggesting that<br>the blinding procedure actually worked<br>though these are the results of the<br>study and in Cola analysis showed that<br>there was a significant decrease in an<br>intense desire to eat Poe stimulation in<br>the treatment group compared to the<br>placebo group also when comparing posts<br>to pre stimulation you see a decrease in<br>beta activity in the dorsal anterior<br>cingulate cortex so the final study I'm<br>going to describe use an operant<br>conditioning technique called<br>interest low neurofeedback to treat food<br>addiction so instead of targeting the<br>anterior cingulate cortex which is part<br>of the salience network we targeted the<br>posterior cingulate cortex which is part<br>of the default mode Network like Dirk<br>said theoretically these two areas are<br>anticorrelated so an increase in pcc or<br>a decrease in the acc activity may<br>correlate to a decrease in craving a<br>note on infrastop inference law has a<br>frequency of less than 0.1 in fresno is<br>a communication wave so it connects the<br>two networks in fresno signals are also<br>carrier waves which allows higher<br>information waves such as the beta wave<br>to nest on top onto it so for<br>neurofeedback firstly we acquire whole<br>brain EEG data using an amplifier and an<br>EEG cap a program quantifies iossef<br>impressed low activity from the PCC and<br>is if it reaches a certain threshold it<br>produced the program produces a sound as<br>a reward as a feedback that sound<br>strengthens iossef activity in the PCC<br>and this happens in a loop in our study<br>the treatment was for 20 minutes and in<br>the placebo group the reward sound was<br>played at random so the aims of the<br>study was to examine whether is fnf of<br>the PCC is technically feasible and can<br>result in measurable changes in brain<br>activity 21 women participated in the<br>study they all had a BMI of 25 or more<br>and Scott more than three on the Yale<br>food addiction skill the primary outcome<br>of this study was a eg brain activity<br>and secondary outcomes were craving<br>measured using the seq s and well-being<br>measured using the W Hirsch of five<br>well-being skill so just like the<br>previous study it was a six-week<br>randomized double-blind parallel study<br>at baseline participants completed the<br>quest<br>and we collect the EEG data all<br>participants had six sessions of is fnf<br>or placebo over a two weeks period post<br>intervention which is two days after the<br>last simulation participants completed<br>all baseline assessments again so these<br>are the primary outcome of the study<br>which is brain activity in panels a B<br>and C you see that there is an increase<br>in in Fresno activity post treatment in<br>the posterior cingulate cortex in the<br>treatment group compared to the placebo<br>group results also showed that there was<br>increase in beta interest law nesting<br>post emulation in the treatment group<br>compared to the placebo group these are<br>some of the secondary results of the<br>secondary measures of the study so post<br>emulation there was a significant<br>decrease in the different craving meshes<br>and we also found that there was an<br>increase in subjective well-being in the<br>treatment group compared to the placebo<br>group post intervention so this last<br>panel here this analysis was done only<br>in the treatment group according to the<br>WHL five well-being skill those who have<br>a score of less than 50 have poorer<br>subjective well-being and also have a<br>score more than 50 has good well-being<br>so what we did was we divided the groups<br>into below 50 and above 50 so what you<br>see is that those who had a well-being<br>score of below 50 at baseline<br>significantly benefited from the<br>treatment compared to those who had a<br>well-being of above 50<br>so in conclusion addiction is a<br>biological psychiatric disorder and he<br>has a great impact not only on the<br>individual but on society his main trip<br>problem is the high prevalence of relax<br>which is caused by craving cues and<br>stress targeting our dACC as a common<br>hub in the tree involve prince acute<br>seems logical and a treatment can be<br>performed by different non-invasive and<br>invasive neuromodulation treatment of<br>addiction requires multidisciplinary<br>approach and the studies that I have<br>just described for the first studies to<br>use this approach and they have<br>promising results for pilot studies and<br>important for the investigation in<br>larger clinical trials thank you I am<br>sure that there are a raft of thoughts<br>and questions Georgia has a microphone<br>here in a cube that she will throw to<br>anybody who wants to talk or ask a<br>question so that we get this on time<br>could I sit the ball rolling by just<br>asking are there effects when you when<br>you do the stimulation on motivation<br>more generally if you interrupt craving<br>does it does it impact on motivation for<br>other tasks as well given that what I<br>understood you said that that the<br>process was generic in terms of<br>substance or task this is a very good<br>question and we have not looked at it<br>but of course this target the entire<br>singlet it is a target that and that is<br>involved or that can be used not just<br>for alcohol addiction but is being used<br>also for for other pathologies so from a<br>theoretical perspective I would say yes<br>however if you lesion the Russell part<br>of into your singlet motivation in<br>general does not seem to be altered<br>psychologically what is altered however<br>is sustain the temperature by<br>suppressing the activity it becomes more<br>difficult to long-term concentrate or<br>focus on one thing which is of course<br>also the goal of the treatment because<br>patients with addiction have the<br>opposite is that they can only focus on<br>one thing that's the substance of abuse<br>but considering even though we haven't<br>looked at it from in a clinical group<br>the ideas that yes it will decrease<br>motivation so for example if people are<br>on cocaine and you showed them erotic<br>circuit is already hijacked by the by<br>the cocaine and so another biological<br>stimulus will not motivate them as much<br>as you would expect<br>or as in controls in which the circuit<br>is not hijacked yet questions I'm just<br>on that on the same sort of way unfold<br>there with the activation of the<br>sympathetic nervous system is that I<br>mean you talk about the fight and flight<br>response is that at all affected let's<br>say if something sudden would have<br>happened it was to require your<br>attention in your you know flight resume<br>in ethics in their after changing ACC<br>that's a good question and this is part<br>of ongoing research now that sibling is<br>performing we're together with Luke<br>Wilson from internal medicine and and<br>Tyson who's also here present in the<br>room where we want to see how does the<br>sympathetic and the parasympathetic<br>system how can we influence them in<br>healthy controls that being said most<br>neuromodulation techniques are<br>interesting and that they seem to work<br>especially on once you deviate from the<br>norm so if you are a healthy control<br>actually it's way more difficult and we<br>tried to stimulate the anterior<br>cingulate part in healthy controls and<br>phenomenologically any psychological<br>measure any behavioral measure that we<br>looked at we couldn't find any<br>differences where<br>but we didn't look at autonomic nervous<br>system per se which is what we're<br>currently looking at partially to<br>address the question that your that<br>you're posing so the hypothesis might be<br>probably not but if you're in a constant<br>hyper sympathetic Drive then we might<br>bring it back to the norm if you're in<br>the norm it becomes difficult for two<br>reasons maybe there is a ceiling effect<br>that was so we can't measure it there<br>might be differences but we can't<br>measure it but if we can't measure it<br>right just more of a technical question<br>about the electrodes itself if you're<br>putting a voltage over the area and<br>question are you you're trying to<br>increase or decrease the amount of<br>neuronal activity in that region is it<br>how does that work and and which of the<br>studies are you talking about a non<br>invasive or invasive or uh or the<br>neurofeedback because and there are<br>feedback we don't apply any car we<br>measure voltages but we don't act with<br>the external or the internal it is<br>that's a very good question and it's<br>strange that we've been using for<br>example implants for for over fifty<br>forty forty years and we still have<br>another clue what we're doing we don't<br>what we know is that if you use high<br>frequencies and tonic mode you probably<br>in induce an electro physiological<br>silence and the area that you target<br>so basically the cells can't follow the<br>current that you inject but lower<br>frequencies and partially you can drive<br>cells to follow the rhythm but if you<br>then increase the frequency<br>they just can't follow and you create an<br>electrophysiological science with a<br>burst of activity intermittently now<br>it's exactly these bursts that drive<br>oscillations that so that might actually<br>induce a lower frequency now with burst<br>stimulation the ones that we used for in<br>the addiction study with the implants<br>your instead of blocking activity you're<br>actually driving activity that's what we<br>assumed that your driving activity to<br>follow the frequency that you're<br>injecting and so what we've seen and<br>which we didn't report here is that the<br>of the two failures they were actually<br>being stimulated at ten Hertz burst mode<br>which is a little bit too high because<br>the natural frequency of the target area<br>is a little bit lower in between four<br>and seven Hertz the ones that responded<br>well were actually using words being<br>stimulated at their natural occurring<br>frequency whereas as you've seen on the<br>images the<br>oscillation frequency in those endless<br>patients had gone up to beta freezers<br>instead of the normal four to seven<br>Hertz they're actually running a twelve<br>to two thirty Hertz so this over<br>activity is also what we reduced by by<br>stimulation at least an amplitude so to<br>answer your question when we depending<br>on the frequency and the stimulation<br>design you either block activity so what<br>do you do that or you do a single aa to<br>me you make a lesion is actually the<br>same the problem with that is that<br>effect when you create a lesion is<br>usually only transient for about six<br>months and after six months the effect<br>wears off this is why we we looked at<br>one year because we know one year is if<br>you have still in effect after one year<br>that is wait that is better than what<br>you would expect with a lesion so yeah<br>we're we're driving it but that is<br>because of the frequency that we use and<br>stimulation is like ladies and gentlemen<br>where we're at time and we have been<br>very privileged I think to hear of this<br>groundbreaking research happening in the<br>Dunedin School of Medicine and we think<br>you three very very much for your work<br>and for sharing this with us thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
