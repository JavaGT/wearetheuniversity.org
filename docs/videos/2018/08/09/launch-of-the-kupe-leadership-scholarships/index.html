100% accurate.</p><p>well thank you it's an absolute<br>privilege to be with you this evening<br>and I think it's just an incredible<br>innovation I do think in these kupe<br>scholarships so I really wanted to just<br>again also echo Stewart's thoughts and<br>acknowledge that I think this is a<br>wonderful addition to the academic<br>landscape in New Zealand and I do think<br>for the University and all of the energy<br>and the people that have come together<br>to make it happen<br>and John MacCormack sorry yeah John i'ma<br>call McBaine I was getting it the wrong<br>way round to observe whether with a<br>double-barrel but but I think it's just<br>you know his generosity what he's done<br>for the roads but also what he's done<br>more broadly with these sorts of<br>scholarships around the world I just<br>think is absolutely extraordinary look<br>what I wanted to share with you this<br>evening is just some reflections on why<br>I think a scholarship like this is<br>actually needed clearly there are many<br>great scholarships in New Zealand at<br>Auckland University around the world but<br>I do think there is something very<br>special about the why of of this<br>scholarship and why I think it really<br>matters I also like to share with you<br>just some reflections on the type of<br>young people that I think the<br>scholarship should be looking to unleash<br>and should be looking to target I'd like<br>to again share some humble thoughts on I<br>think the type of interventions and the<br>type of apprenticeship and gifts that we<br>can give these young people to unleash<br>and then finally just an aspiration<br>around the impact the long-term impact<br>that I think is needed from these sorts<br>of scholarships and the sorts of talent<br>and young people that we do need to<br>apprentice and unleash and inspire given<br>the opportunities and the challenges<br>that I think our world is facing and<br>closer to home that our country is<br>facing going forward and I actually<br>couldn't think of a better construct<br>than kupe to actually help us find<br>nurture grow and unleash some of the<br>talent that we're going to need to<br>really help steward and nurture our<br>great little country in the years to<br>come so firstly also to congratulate you<br>I think the choice of name is clever I<br>really do love the notion of coop a and<br>a couple of reasons I claim I'm not I'm<br>an August company I'm not a scholar in<br>any<br>will form around the history of gup-a or<br>my understanding of FACA papa but last<br>Christmas I did devour tongue a toffee<br>nor a history that that wonderful work<br>which again I know Auckland University<br>had a lot to do with and there are four<br>things about Kupe that I do think are<br>incredibly symbolic of what the<br>scholarship stands for to start with he<br>was first as New Zealanders we like to<br>be modest and humble but we actually do<br>love when people are first be it Hillary<br>be it Rutherford be at first to see for<br>some every FACA Papa goes back to coop a<br>real or imagined but everyone every you<br>he finds away back to Cooper he was<br>first and I think there's something<br>about that being first and being you<br>know that the leader of that type that I<br>also think represents the scholarship<br>very very well the second thing is he<br>was real as far as we know amongst<br>there's always mythology and what was<br>and we know Maui was mythology but as<br>far as we know on the balance of<br>probabilities Kupe was a real individual<br>he was a real person he was actually the<br>first to arrive in New Zealand and again<br>others claim and there's other sort of<br>evidence that we have but the balance of<br>probabilities he was a real individual<br>and I'll come back to why I also think<br>authenticity and authentic leadership<br>and a realness is going to be important<br>to us other<br>I mean the fact that he was a real<br>figure is important<br>the third thing he was an incredible<br>pioneer and I think in the narrative of<br>Cooper we actually don't acknowledge<br>enough the skills of navigation of<br>seamanship that were required to<br>actually have got here the other thing<br>is also he was a pioneer in a unique<br>time one of the insights for me and<br>reading tongue as a fennel was this<br>notion that no one could ever figure out<br>that how were we settled in the 1300s<br>when we had sailing technology that<br>could only deal with following winds<br>when they were have always been<br>headwinds so how did you actually<br>reconcile that well the new hypothesis<br>worth quite a lot of evidence is that it<br>that was actually a period of<br>significant climate change where the<br>winds were actually the other way round<br>so rather than predominant westerlies<br>they were predominantly<br>Dilys so the technology was actually<br>possible to get from the society islands<br>to New Zealand so I also think the<br>symbolism of being a pioneer in a<br>particular moment of time that needed it<br>and I'll talk a little bit about the<br>context Stewart kind of stole my thunder<br>a little bit with Trump and the role<br>that he's playing but I do think there<br>is something about the age that we live<br>in and the need for genuine pioneers and<br>looking for as it were the DNA of<br>individuals that are most likely to have<br>the bravery and the intellectual<br>curiosity that will actually see those<br>ideas and the innovations that we're<br>going to need and the final element<br>about Kupe in the adhesive house there<br>is something about that I love about the<br>scholarship that it is ours it's<br>designed for New Zealanders for Kiwis<br>and I do think there is in a global<br>world I do for my sons have five kids<br>they've all grown up abroad I've brought<br>them home because they wanted to study<br>in New Zealand but there all of a sudden<br>now looking at you know as I said why<br>not Oakland University and well you know<br>but how does it rate with Oxford and<br>Harvard and and I think there is<br>something about actually creating<br>something distinctive and special that<br>is ours that to Stuart's point is that<br>glue that is magical and can compete in<br>that truly global world that we are in<br>today that it does take the coop a type<br>interventions of the world to be<br>competitive to keep our best young<br>people at home and engaged in our issues<br>in our country and our way so I think<br>the fact that coop a was ours it wasn't<br>a Shing here or a Christopher Columbus<br>he was our Explorer<br>he was our pioneer and that's it so I<br>love it that he was first he was real he<br>was a genuine pioneer and he's ours and<br>I do think the symbolism of that for the<br>scholarship in my view I think you've<br>actually named these these scholarships<br>in a wonderful way a little bit on the<br>why why why a need for a scholarship<br>like coop a why in this particular time<br>well I do think it was interesting if<br>you heard you probably don't but for<br>someone that lived in China for as long<br>as I did this 18th Party Congress that<br>occurred last October in China was truly<br>historically<br>for some good reasons and some<br>not-so-good reasons but amongst the good<br>reasons President Xi did actually talk<br>about we live in genuinely historic<br>times and when the Chinese talk about<br>living in genuinely historic times you<br>normally do tend to listen given their<br>the length of history that they look<br>about but you know some of the things<br>that I do think to add weight to that if<br>you look at the current technology<br>revolution that we're in the midst of<br>it's a hundred times faster and 300<br>times the scale of the original<br>industrial revolution for the mathematic<br>mathematicians amongst you you get that<br>that that's 3,000 times the intensity of<br>what was the induced in original<br>Industrial Revolution there's something<br>unique about that intensity in that pace<br>in that scale I'm Lord Stern who I think<br>is a brilliant individual that I've had<br>the opportunity to work with over many<br>years is one of the world's leading<br>advocates around climate change in the<br>materiality of what we do he talks about<br>that we currently are consuming planet<br>Earth at the rate of two planets now by<br>anyone's definition that's not really<br>sustainable when you consume planet<br>Earth at the rate of two planets and<br>most economists certainly my<br>organization is writing a lot at the<br>moment around we're at the end of a<br>50-year consensus around how you run an<br>economy how you run a society how you<br>run a democracy many people talk about<br>us being in a period of the great<br>disequilibrium where many markets and<br>society and we just we're out of<br>equilibrium what will it take to get<br>back to equilibrium how do we find the<br>pathways there so I'm a strong believer<br>that we are in a period of time that's<br>not all doom and gloom there's<br>extraordinary opportunity but I think we<br>need a level of intellectual curiosity<br>we need leaders who will explore and<br>pioneer and do things in a different way<br>in the way that kupe was faced with<br>quite a different climatic reality and<br>the opportunity that he sees there's a<br>result of it and I think we need to<br>groom and unleash young people that have<br>the skills have the mindset have the<br>ambition have the resilience to be able<br>to be at the forefront of developing<br>those things now I you know as a Kiwi<br>through and through to my bones believe<br>maybe<br>maybe without fact base but that we are<br>actually really good as a people in<br>those sorts of moments when you look<br>back to the very first depression<br>gentleman by the name of Edward trade<br>air our first Minister of Labour<br>actually created the world's ever jobs<br>agency the first ever matching of jobs<br>and moving people around and the<br>interventions to make that happen we<br>really didn't make much more than<br>Carolyn Webb did around creating a<br>social safety net and creating<br>opportunities for all and I do think<br>there's something about Kiwis in our DNA<br>that we are maybe we cruise a bit too<br>much when things are good but when there<br>is moments of dislocation and disruption<br>we are often at our best and I believe<br>it's also our young people that are at<br>the best in those moments and that Kupe<br>offers an opportunity to really find and<br>groom and apprentice those young people<br>that can really be at the forefront of<br>this unique context that we live at it's<br>also interesting in terms of in this<br>moment of time McKinsey and company the<br>company that I work for prides itself on<br>sort of scooping the best talent<br>globally and we've always you don't gone<br>to the best universities in the world<br>and sought to get the very best people<br>but for the first time we're actually<br>going off-piste<br>and are actually thinking quite<br>differently about the sort of talent and<br>the sorts of skills this year we've gone<br>looking for a hundred Nelson Mandela's<br>baby Nelson Mandela's that have no<br>academic background we've gone looking<br>for nature's heiress the cracks leaders<br>that have just done extraordinary things<br>and have been bold and brave we've gone<br>looking for leaders that have had<br>extraordinary setbacks that have had the<br>resilience to overcome we've gone<br>looking for talent in quite different<br>places now I'm not saying that I think<br>there's an importance to have an<br>academic foundation but I also think the<br>magic of kupe is also in that pioneering<br>exploring way I think we should go<br>looking for some different profiles<br>looking for some different<br>characteristics of individuals that are<br>going to define leadership of the future<br>rather than the patterns and the<br>recognition of leaders that we've had<br>historically and<br>again just in terms of to not saying<br>that these have to be the<br>characteristics but a few of the things<br>that we go looking for that I again<br>think in that coupe a spirit that we<br>could over index on for our young people<br>I do think resilience looking for young<br>people that have resilience either born<br>with it all through you know that muscle<br>of resilience being tested through<br>something in their childhood or teenage<br>years that they've they've overcome I<br>think there's something of any empathy<br>leaders that are able to empathize that<br>if war worked and lived in other<br>people's shoes understand it can<br>empathize and glue and bring teams<br>together I think there's something about<br>people that it just take initiative that<br>are prepared to make things happen<br>rather than let things happen I think<br>there's something about noble purpose I<br>think individuals that nothing gets me<br>more that when I sit down with a<br>talented young person than you say<br>what's your aspiration and they say to<br>make money and you jack your heart just<br>sinks and saying let's not a bad thing<br>but it shouldn't be the ultimate goal<br>that should be a means to an end what<br>what do you want to do what's the<br>contribution that you want to make and I<br>think finding young people that are just<br>burning with youthful idealism with<br>noble purpose that want to make a<br>difference that want to make a<br>contribution and I also talk about<br>people that are glocal what we mean by<br>glocal people that have a global<br>perspective but they're deeply local<br>they're deeply passionate about their<br>heritage their people where they come<br>from but also have the global<br>perspective and the global understanding<br>of where they can contribute and how<br>they can bring the best ideas back to a<br>place like New Zealand to make real<br>change happen I then look at what are<br>the things that kupe could add to really<br>unleash and unlock those individuals<br>well I think there's something about<br>aspiration I was talking about some of<br>you and again I think many of us that<br>have had the privilege of doing<br>reasonably well in our academic careers<br>and the like there was someone that<br>unleashed that seed of aspiration I<br>remember arriving from the country being<br>given a spelling test and put in the<br>bottom class of what arguably what was<br>one of the worst schools in Auckland<br>going home sort of not quite knowing<br>how to break this news to my parents<br>that I was sort of in the bottom class<br>of a school that they were quite<br>disappointed that was the only school<br>they could get me into and I can<br>remember but I said dad don't worry it's<br>not good I know but don't worry the<br>teacher said I could be a Rhodes Scholar<br>and what for have a go not really<br>knowing what that was saying was<br>something I think you could do better<br>than working on the roads but again<br>someone had unleashed that aspiration<br>and I remember the same teacher actually<br>he had a saying it was also our rugby<br>coach but he had a saying that if your<br>dreams don't scare you they're not big<br>enough and that stayed with me for many<br>years and I do think with Kupe there is<br>something particularly with our<br>Polynesian young people where I don't<br>think they often know how good they can<br>really be and I hope that coupe eight<br>could be one way that we unleash<br>ambition we unleash mindset in terms of<br>individuals I remember one funny thing<br>with Oxford in terms of Oxford when you<br>arrived as a Rhodes Scholar your first<br>induction of basically they try and beat<br>the youthful idealism out of you saying<br>that many young people have tried to<br>change Oxford but over eight hundred<br>years<br>the institution always wins and I don't<br>remember the sort of notion of just<br>trying to squeeze out of you this the<br>sort of sense of youthful idealism I'd<br>love that we did the officer that we<br>amplified that we that we as it were put<br>sort of you know fuel on that fire of<br>youthful light of unleashing the<br>ambition of our young people I also do<br>thinking again I think it's brilliant<br>that the New Zealand Leadership<br>Institute is involved in terms of I do<br>think there's something about the<br>pedagogy of leadership there is<br>something about how you lead yourself<br>how you lead others how you lead<br>institutions and I do think being able<br>to equip young people early with those<br>often simple skills but incredibly<br>fundamental skills of how they steward<br>their leadership ambition and passions<br>and I really think that that's wonderful<br>I do think there's something about<br>mentorship and sponsorship in every<br>successful CEO and every successful<br>public sector leader and every<br>successful academic leader you will<br>always find a sponsor or a mentor that<br>had that arm around the shoulder<br>apprenticeship and I really think the<br>wonder of that Kupe is building that in<br>I think mentorship and sponsorship is<br>absolutely critical and I think a<br>wonderful Under<br>I also think there's something about<br>just the exposure to ideas um I remember<br>having dinner actually with Edward de<br>Bono and in Auckland many years ago and<br>asked him how how do you how you've been<br>so intellectually productive over the<br>years you know when you look at how many<br>books the ideas the range of topics and<br>he said it's simple I'm in a different<br>city every day I invite 12 interesting<br>people to dinner and I get provoked just<br>by the exposure to ideas he then quoted<br>me the GK Chesterton quote that<br>creativity is finding a great idea and<br>forgetting where you found it and then<br>he said and I just I connect dots and<br>for me the magic is just being exposed<br>to ideas and I connect that and I do<br>think again the wonder of some of the<br>international places were the Rhodes<br>Scholarship I worked harder at Auckland<br>University than I did at Oxford<br>University and many respects the quality<br>of the tuition was higher at Auckland<br>then at Oxford but there is something<br>about the exposure that you get to the<br>breadth of ideas at some of the world's<br>leading universities that I think in<br>today's day and age we can replicate<br>that we can actually make that happen<br>and I think again Kupe could do that<br>extraordinarily well so I think there is<br>something I just love the design the<br>pedagogy of Cooper I think there's<br>something truly distinctive that not<br>only will you find these special young<br>people I think you're gonna add to them<br>in ways that is more unique and more<br>special than even things like the Rhodes<br>Scholarship does for young people so I<br>think that that's just extraordinary and<br>long-term I do think the impact when you<br>actually take you know when you look at<br>what has occurred with history if we<br>have a you know we start with a cadre of<br>20 young people when you think of you<br>know great revolutions what it's taken<br>to move countries I've always been<br>inspired by William Wilberforce the<br>individual that really led the abolition<br>of slavery in the late 18th century in<br>the United Kingdom again people forget<br>slavery was the largest industry in the<br>UK at the time so being able to sort of<br>turn over and remove the largest<br>industry that's not a trivial but there<br>were a dozen individuals<br>that did that that did it wasn't just<br>Wilberforce it was peel it was you know<br>several others in terms of that that<br>were that team if it took 12 people to<br>overthrow arguably one of the greatest<br>evils of our time and destroy the<br>largest industry at the time<br>what could twenty young people do and 20<br>young people not just with one year but<br>over a generation that if we if we<br>select for them if we apprentice and<br>grow them in the way that we attend to<br>and that they have this unique moment in<br>time that I do think is actually pretty<br>special in terms of which pathway we go<br>I mean again I'm always optimistic about<br>that New Zealand will always find the<br>right way and will always get there but<br>there is nothing if we could unleash I<br>think some of our best talent<br>apprentice' inspire emilyschutt<br>connected mentor it then I think when we<br>look back in twenty thirty years time we<br>may actually look in this humble<br>gathering and the corner and Princess<br>Street is actually being really pivotal<br>in our nation's history that we actually<br>sowed the seeds of growing some of our<br>greatest leaders and our greatest young<br>people that not only did magical things<br>for our country but actually provided a<br>little bit of a beacon on a hill for a<br>world that desperately needs the leader<br>of the free world defending the leader<br>of the not so free world in terms of<br>where it is so thank you for being here<br>Stuart thank you for everything you have<br>done and your leadership at an<br>initiative for all of those that have<br>done the real hard work to make this<br>happen I do think this is the start of I<br>think something that will be pretty<br>special and pretty unique and that will<br>look back in the years to come to say<br>that we've grown some extraordinary<br>young people hey thank you so much for<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
