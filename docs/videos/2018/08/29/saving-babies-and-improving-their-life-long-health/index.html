For more information, visit https://fmhs-50years-events.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/<br> <br>The first 1,000 days, starting before conception, are not only amongst the most perilous in life’s journey, but also are critical for setting the foundations for health through to adulthood. Researchers from the faculty and from the Liggins Institute have contributed enormously to our understanding of fetal and newborn health and of how to decrease some of the risks to the baby during these early vital days.<br> <br>Speakers:<br><br>‘Maternal sleep position- a modifiable risk factor for stillbirth’ Professor Lesley McCowan – Head of Dept of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, School of Medicine<br>‘Developing therapies for fetal growth restriction’ Associate Professor Katie Groom, the Liggins Institute<br>‘Saving Babies’ Brains’ Professor Alistair Gunn – Professor of Physiology and Paediatrics, Dept of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences<br>‘Preventing sudden infant death: past, present and future’ Professor Ed Mitchell -Dept of Paediatrics, Child and Youth Health, School of Medicine<br>‘The microbiome and the lifelong effects of preterm birth’ Associate Professor Justin O’Sullivan, the Liggins Institute<br>‘Keeping babies sweet: blood sugar in newborns’ Distinguished Professor Jane Harding, the Liggins Institute</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen I<br>think we should start on time my name is<br>Peter stone I'm professor of maternal<br>fetal medicine in the department of<br>obstetrics and gynecology and I just<br>have two housekeeping matters I'm<br>informed that we're not expecting a fire<br>alarm practice tonight so if there is a<br>fire alarm we're supposed to meet<br>outside in the foyer and please because<br>we are recording all these sessions<br>cellphones off or on silent please thank<br>you so it's my very great pleasure to<br>welcome you this evening to our talks<br>and this 50th anniversary series marking<br>the opening of the Auckland School of<br>Medicine and actually we're particularly<br>excited about presenting these talks<br>tonight which are good news stories<br>about saving or enhancing the lives of<br>our most vulnerable children Walkman<br>continues to be a world leader in<br>perinatal and placental research indeed<br>we actually are also celebrating their<br>50 years ago their professor Sir Graham<br>Liggins working in the post graduate<br>school of obstetrics and gynecology the<br>forerunner of the department that our<br>first speaker hits today sir Graham<br>Liggins showed the effects of steroids<br>on preterm lung function and sheep and<br>he embarked upon one of the most<br>important trials he ever done in<br>perinatal medicine to demonstrate<br>steroid efficacy in human lung<br>development and save thousands of<br>preterm babies some of you may also be<br>interested to know particularly those of<br>you that may be somewhat skeptical about<br>committees that the head of the post<br>graduate school of the particulars in<br>gynecology professor Bonham chaired the<br>Senate advisory committee tasked with<br>the details of the establishment of the<br>Medical School it had originally been<br>thought that the school would open in<br>1970 however the committee worked so<br>well even faster<br>than the chance of a seductive Rob had<br>imagined that the school was ready to<br>admit its first students in 1968 so we<br>are celebrating 50 memorable years<br>tonight in 2018 well done Senate<br>Advisory Committee so without further<br>ado I would like to hand over to su<br>Brewster who's the executive director of<br>the Auckland medical research foundation<br>to say a few words thank you sue there<br>might be but take the course does work<br>well good evening everybody and a very<br>warm welcome to you all thank you so<br>much for coming out tonight a little bit<br>chilly I think there's been a few<br>traffic events along the way as well so<br>it's great to see so many of you here<br>and of course tonight's topic is saving<br>babies something that you're all<br>interested in that is dear to our hearts<br>so okhla miracle research foundation our<br>purpose is to fund medical research end<br>of the 71 million dollars of funding<br>that we've awarded to research a lot of<br>that has gone into funding research into<br>babies and their health I think you'll<br>see behind me dr. Shirley Tompkins so<br>there's a newsletter that will be in<br>front of you that says autumn 2016 it's<br>not because we want to give you outdated<br>news leaders we'll get rid of them it's<br>because he's a piece in there that is<br>dedicated to dr. shirley Tonkin and the<br>work that she's done on the food page<br>inside so dr. shirley Tonkin was a<br>remarkable woman she dedicated her life<br>to saving babies and she was one of<br>three researchers who led to the<br>invention of the foam and suits and<br>babies car seats which prevented the<br>heads from falling forward and choking<br>and that simple device literally has<br>saved thousands and thousands of babies<br>lives since that point in time and that<br>piece on Shirley there's a great excerpt<br>in the air for all<br>professor ed Mitchell of University of<br>Auckland and he says about Shirley and<br>her research Shirley has been one of the<br>most irritating people I ever worked<br>with<br>she has frequently come up with the<br>right idea but without any data to prove<br>it only to be found right after several<br>years of research and therein lies the<br>beauty of research and so dr. Shirley<br>Tonkin dedicated to her life and in 2016<br>at the age of 94 Shirley passed away but<br>leaving the legacy of saving thousands<br>of thousands of babies lives and her<br>research lives on and also she left a<br>gift in her will to the a.m. RF so there<br>I guess who legacy continues to give to<br>the medical professional and all of the<br>researchers that will go on to do<br>amazing work speaking of amazing people<br>and amazing work we've got wonderful<br>presenters here tonight who will talk to<br>us about babies and their medical<br>treatments and research connected with<br>that so thank you very much to our<br>presenters and also tonight please don't<br>forget to fill out your feedback forms<br>which will all be in front of you very<br>important to us so we know what you want<br>and what you want to hear about in the<br>future there'll also be a folder like<br>this available for more of you out on<br>the front desk to find out more about<br>Auckland medical research foundation and<br>what we do thank you to all of our<br>supporters here tonight we simply<br>couldn't do what we do without you and I<br>think you'll see out there a hundred<br>percent of your donation goes directly<br>to medical research all of our<br>administration costs are funded by your<br>generous benefactor so you can be<br>assured 100% of donation goes directly<br>to where you want it to go so without<br>further ado thank you so much a very<br>warm welcome and I know that you will<br>I'd now like to introduce distinguished<br>professor Jane Harding who will<br>introduce our speakers thank you<br>change thank you it's a great honor to<br>be here to chair this evenings lecture<br>series on saving babies lives and<br>improving lifelong health we have six<br>speakers tonight who are going to talk<br>about their research contributing to<br>that vision each speaker will speak for<br>about ten minutes and I will introduce<br>each one and we will simply move on<br>after each one because we think six<br>talks is quite a lot for you to listen<br>to if we have time at the end we will<br>take questions and if we don't well the<br>speakers will be here so come and talk<br>to them after the event<br>our first speaker tonight is Professor<br>Leslie McHale Leslie was the top<br>qualifying student in the fourth intake<br>of this medical school and she's<br>currently head of the department of<br>obstetrics and gynecology her major<br>research interest amongst many and the<br>one she's going to share with us tonight<br>is prevention of stillbirth an<br>acknowledgment of her research<br>achievements Leslie's recently been<br>awarded the Glickman medal for 2018<br>which is the premier recognition of<br>research within the faculty please and<br>please welcome professor leslie makan<br>sleep position a modifiable risk factor<br>thank you very much for the introduction<br>I'm Jane and it's fantastic to see so<br>many many people here in Rome and so<br>many young people as well so on with my<br>talk well my I'm going to talk to you<br>about stillbirth this evening and that's<br>an area that I spend quite a lot of my<br>research time involved with so we<br>defined stillbirth in New Zealand as the<br>death of an unborn baby at or after 20<br>weeks but our research focuses on what<br>we call late stillbirth which is the<br>death of an unborn baby at or after 28<br>weeks and we focus on this group of<br>babies because of these babies are live<br>born we expect them to survive and have<br>a healthy survival and every year in New<br>Zealand approximately 160 New Zealand<br>babies are stillborn after 28 weeks so<br>if we think about that that's about five<br>empty classrooms that are that are<br>unfold was was with babies who have died<br>before booths but we have got an<br>exciting opportunity because if we can<br>identify modifiable risk factors we have<br>the potential to reduce this tragic<br>tragedy for families and in society so<br>what what sort of modifiable respecters<br>could we think about and it's been known<br>for decades that the position of the<br>mother<br>affects blood supply and early studies<br>nurses a picture from a publication in<br>1969 this diagram shows that a mother<br>lying on her back the inferior vena cava<br>which is the main vein in the abdomen is<br>compressed by the large pregnant uterus<br>and our inner-city colleagues have known<br>about this for a long time and when a<br>mother has a cesarean section they took<br>the table over to the left almost to the<br>extent that it's hard to reach they<br>reach the mum she's tipped over so much<br>and they do that to try and improve the<br>blood supply to the mother and the baby<br>so in 2006 we started a study called the<br>Auckland still bear study where we asked<br>the creature a question amongst others<br>is going to sleep lying on the back a<br>respect to fellate stuber's in our cases<br>where<br>mother's worst abuse in the Auckland<br>region and our control group will woman<br>who had ongoing pregnancies at a similar<br>stage in pregnancy so what did we find<br>in this research was published in the<br>BMJ and what we found was that woman who<br>reported that they went to sleep lying<br>on their back the night before their<br>baby was stillborn had a turn a half<br>fold increase in their and risk of<br>stillbirth in that risk persisted after<br>we adjusted for other common risk<br>factors for stillbirth now when we<br>published this there was a lot of<br>discussion and correspondence with the<br>journal and whilst it was thought that<br>these findings were biologically<br>plausible people thought that there was<br>an urgent need to confirm these findings<br>and it was very premature to be making<br>recommendations about optimum going to<br>sleep practices for pregnant woman so we<br>rose to the challenge and we conducted<br>the next phase of our research so we<br>undertook a New Zealand wide study we<br>have a very talented team in our<br>department who have undertaken some<br>amazing physiological studies which I'm<br>going to talk to you about in a minute<br>and we also surveyed the opinions of<br>pregnant women in South Auckland which<br>is our community which has the highest<br>uh birth rate in New Zealand so this<br>slide shows the results from our New<br>Zealand wide study and what you'll see<br>here is that the risk for mothers who<br>went to sleep lying on your back was<br>almost exactly the same as what we had<br>found in the Auckland study so we<br>confirmed these findings there's now<br>three additional studies that have been<br>published and we're very fortunate that<br>we've now got money to undertake what we<br>call an individual participant data<br>measure analysis which means that we<br>pull the data the individual data from<br>all the studies that have been done and<br>we can look to look at those results in<br>a combined study so what did those<br>results show so you'll see up here that<br>the the odds of late stillbirth were<br>very similar to what I have shown you in<br>our individual studies in another good<br>news story on this slide<br>was that woman who reported that they<br>went to sleep lying on their right side<br>had have had the same risk as women who<br>went to sleep lying on the left side so<br>that means that pregnant woman can<br>choose which side they would like to go<br>to sleep on so we've got a fantastic<br>international collaborative research<br>group that also involves consumers and<br>bereaved parent organizations and<br>there'll be a lot of research that comes<br>out of this IPD going forward so having<br>made these clinical findings we now sit<br>to to try to understand the physiology<br>behind it and this work has been led by<br>Professor Peter stone and collaboration<br>with a number of other members from our<br>department and from the department of<br>physiology so Peter recruited Sir she<br>healthy pregnant woman and looked at the<br>behavior of their babies and when they<br>were lying on the avec the left side and<br>their right side and monitored the fetal<br>heart through them mothers abdomen and<br>what they found was that low activity<br>behavior and the baby and we call that<br>state one if and we can see a picture of<br>it here and this reflects reduced oxygen<br>consumption and that was much more<br>common when mothers were positioned on<br>their back in done contrast the high<br>feat elective at e state which we call<br>State for EF was very uncommon when the<br>mother was lying on her back so this<br>suggests that lying on the back is<br>associated with lower oxygen behavior<br>and the baby even in a healthy pregnancy<br>now this work has been extended in it<br>was led by an amazing B mid site honours<br>medical student last year who has<br>undertaken some in magnetic resonance<br>imaging studies during pregnancy so Amy<br>Humphreys leadless work<br>so here's her mother and Lake pregnancy<br>in the MRI scanner lying on her left<br>side and here's her spine and here's the<br>baby in this blue circle as the main<br>vein in the abdomen that we call the<br>vena cava and when the mother turns over<br>onto her back there's almost complete<br>obliteration of that vena cava and<br>there's also a reduction in the diameter<br>of the aorta so to summarize quite a lot<br>of studies and one slide we believe we<br>have<br>a pretty good understanding now about<br>the physiology that's associated with<br>maternal position and the effects that<br>we're seeing in our clinical studies so<br>the pregnant uterus compresses the major<br>vein called the vena cava there's a<br>reduction in the blood going back to the<br>heart and a reduction in the output of<br>blood from the heart there's a reduction<br>in the blood flow from the aorta which<br>is the main artery this leads to a<br>reduced blood supply and the placenta<br>and low oxygen levels in the baby and<br>whilst the healthy baby can cope with a<br>reduction in oxygen levels a baby that<br>is vulnerable or compromised may not be<br>able to do to do the same so with the<br>next step for us was okay well it's all<br>well and good we get now we've got these<br>consistent clinical findings we<br>understand them but can woman change<br>their going to sleep position and the<br>answer is yes they can and they already<br>have so when we recruited woman to the<br>Auckland Stuber study 43% of woman<br>reported they went to sleep on the left<br>side by the time we did our New Zealand<br>wide study they had gone up to 68<br>percent because at that time we thought<br>that left was beast and in our survey of<br>women in South Auckland 85% of woman did<br>they could change their going to sleep<br>position if that was better for their<br>baby so we have been through a cycle of<br>research from hypothesis generation<br>confirming the findings further clinical<br>studies understanding the physiology<br>we've done a survey of women and now<br>we're at a very exciting stage of having<br>launched a public awareness campaign and<br>some of you may have seen some of this<br>information already and this is called<br>to sleep on size while babies inside<br>campaign in this work has been done in<br>collaboration with a large number of<br>professional groups parents groups<br>stillbirth organizations and we've had<br>complete by an incomplete agreement<br>between all of the stakeholders involved<br>which is not always that easy to achieve<br>and we've had an amazing research team<br>and incredible support from cure kids<br>who has<br>behind this project from the outset so<br>we launched this an alignment with our<br>national still biz conference at the end<br>of June and we have produced information<br>leaflets for pregnant women and you may<br>have one of those in front of you take<br>it away if you know somebody who's late<br>in pregnancy information leaflets for<br>health professionals and we've got a<br>video that I will share with you in just<br>a minute so the messages that we want to<br>share with pregnant women and these<br>message has been produced by our<br>stakeholders going to sleep on your side<br>haves the risk of stillbirth compared to<br>going to sleep on your back started we<br>sleep on your side including daytime<br>naps it doesn't matter what side they're<br>both they're both good and it's common<br>to wake up on your back so don't worry<br>about that just roll back onto your side<br>and we suggest that health professionals<br>discuss this at 24 to 26 weeks of<br>pregnancy our next steps are to share<br>this sleep position information and our<br>resources widely we're going to<br>translate our pamphlets and to other<br>widely used languages we're going to<br>evaluate the views of consumers and<br>health professionals about our campaign<br>and we're going to reserve a pregnant<br>woman to see what impact we've had on<br>changing through the changes in the<br>sleep position and of course there's<br>ongoing data about still birth rates so<br>this is a little video that we have<br>produced which I would just like to skip<br>the mouse just to share with you because<br>new research shows that sleeping on your<br>side and the last three months of<br>we eat the cookie its usual to change<br>position wirelessly the important thing<br>to remember is to stand on your side if<br>you wake up on your bag just roll back<br>onto your side going to sleep on your<br>side from 28 weeks of pregnancy means<br>you're helping to keep your baby healthy<br>for more information go to sleep on side<br>dot org dot NZ and my final slide is<br>just to acknowledge the funders who have<br>supported this work in particular cure<br>cuts who has been Mia right from the<br>outset and supported the whole journey<br>from the initial hypothesis generation<br>through to the public awareness campaign<br>and we couldn't have done this work<br>without them also the New Zealand Health<br>Research Council nurture mercy bands and<br>we've had funding from Australia as well<br>for our IPD particular thank you to the<br>participants that's incredible that<br>women who have experienced a Silvius are<br>prepared to share their stories for the<br>you know for advantage of other woman<br>and we're incredibly grateful for that<br>and we've also got a fantastic research<br>team multidisciplinary from several<br>departments within this faculty and<br>multi professionals so it's a pleasure<br>to work as part of those combined team<br>so thank you for your attention<br>our next speaker professor associate<br>professor Katie groom is the associate<br>professor of maternal and perinatal<br>health and the Hugo Charitable Trusts<br>fellow at the Liggins Institute<br>she's a sub specialist in maternal fetal<br>medicine at national women's health in<br>Auckland City Hospital she's passionate<br>about improving health outcomes for<br>mothers and babies through effective<br>clinical trials research and in this<br>role she has been the chair of the<br>Australian New Zealand maternal<br>perinatal Australasian collaborative<br>trials network and she currently chairs<br>the National Executive of the newly<br>established New Zealand wide on track<br>network for better health for mothers<br>and babies Katie is currently leading<br>the New Zealand and Australia Strider<br>trial part of an international<br>consortium exploring a potential therapy<br>for fetal growth restriction and tonight<br>she's going to tell us about developing<br>thanks very much Jana and thank you<br>everyone so much for coming out to<br>listening to us tonight and so I'm going<br>to talk a little bit about developing a<br>specific therapy for fetal greater<br>description and share with you a little<br>bit of the journey that I've been on for<br>the last six or seven years and which<br>one may have been quite familiar to some<br>of you seeing it in the media in recent<br>weeks and but before I start I'm going<br>to introduce you to Archie so as Jane<br>mentioned I'm a maternal fetal medicine<br>specialist so in my clinical job and we<br>see people referred to us when problems<br>arise in their pregnancy so Archie<br>obviously came along with his mum<br>because he was still in new troe at the<br>time to meet me when he was 24 weeks<br>pregnant his mum was 24 weeks pregnant<br>and the reason that they came along to<br>see me was because Archie was much<br>smaller than was expected for how far on<br>he was in the pregnancy and these charts<br>here show that all the parameters of<br>growth were well below what would be the<br>expected norm for this gestational age<br>so I immediately made a diagnosis of<br>fetal growth restriction but this could<br>be caused by a number of different<br>things so my job was to think about what<br>that might be<br>so we went on to look at a number of<br>blood flow patterns both into the<br>placenta from the percentage of the baby<br>and within the baby and what that told<br>me that it was likely that there was a<br>problem with how the placenta was<br>functioning and the reason that our Chi<br>was smaller than expected was due to a<br>condition called utero placental<br>insufficiency and so what does that mean<br>for Archie and his mum well<br>unfortunately there wasn't any magic<br>treatment that we could offer we<br>currently have no proven therapies to<br>aid fetal growth while the baby's still<br>inside the womb<br>unfortunately all we can do is watch<br>mother's very closely watch babies very<br>closely and try and time the best time<br>to deliver because the options that<br>we've got to continue on in that hypoxic<br>environment with a reduced nutrient<br>supply reduced oxygen and risk that risk<br>of stillbirth that Lesley's talked about<br>or the alternative option when this has<br>occurred really early in pregnancy is to<br>get on and deliver the baby but we know<br>then that adds further risks these<br>babies who are already very vulnerable<br>and that's not just an immediate preterm<br>risk while the babies are in the NICU<br>but this is actually a lifelong risk to<br>their health so it's not the ideal<br>situation and it would be much nicer if<br>we could offer a therapy now obviously<br>having said that we think this is<br>related to utero central insufficiency<br>and potentially uterine blood flow a<br>perfect opportunity seems to be can we<br>increase uterine blood flow and there's<br>a number of potential candidates but I'm<br>going to talk about sildenafil which is<br>better known as viagra and a lot of the<br>work is first was developed by Phil<br>Baker who was a professor here at the<br>lagoons but for a couple of years until<br>in 2015 and this has been work that he's<br>been doing for the last 20 years so<br>sildenafil is a drug that helps dilate<br>blood vessels it's particularly<br>developed for its effect on a<br>cardiovascular and pulmonary vasculature<br>but it also affects the pelvis so<br>there's potential that giving it to mums<br>may help the blood vessels to dilate and<br>this is a study taking from some Maya<br>material samples taken after a caesarean<br>section that shows if you apply<br>sildenafil in the laboratory to these<br>blood vessels they do dilate so again<br>giving us an opportunity that maybe it's<br>a good thing to do and over the last 10<br>to 15<br>there's been a huge number of animal<br>studies looking at the potential of<br>sildenafil Joe Stanley worked here at<br>the ligands for a number of years and<br>she's done a lot of work in the mouse<br>model and Charlie Austin did her PhD<br>with us looking at the sheep model and<br>the vast majority of these studies do<br>suggest that sildenafil increases the<br>blood supply increasing the placental<br>vasculature reducing the resistance of<br>blood flow to the baby<br>and in fact particularly the sheep and<br>the mouse model increasing the growth of<br>the baby so can we use it in humans is<br>it a safe thing to do well actually in<br>my job for women who've got a really<br>severe pulmonary vascular condition we<br>already use it in pregnancy it's a small<br>number of women but it hasn't raised<br>safety concerns and it's actually now<br>used quite routinely in the neonatal<br>unit for a condition called persistent<br>pulmonary hypertension of the newborn<br>which is a recognized complication of<br>preterm birth so Phil Baker while he was<br>working in Canada worked with Peter bond<br>Adelson and under a specific ethical<br>clause within their practice they were<br>able to offer women the opportunity to<br>have sildenafil and ten women who had<br>very very small babies and at about that<br>same point as when Archie was small<br>elected to take the therapy and they<br>compared that to 17 women who chose not<br>to take the therapy but we're happy for<br>their information to be shared and this<br>is what they saw when they looked at how<br>well the babies were growing inside the<br>uterus and you can see there clearly<br>that it looks like the babies that<br>mothers were treated received sildenafil<br>grew more and this is by measuring their<br>abdominal circumference an actual fact<br>it also looked like these babies did<br>slightly better they were more likely to<br>survive and more likely to survive<br>discharge from hospital feeling well so<br>what happens next when you've got this<br>information well sadly what happened<br>next was a number of clinicians all<br>around the world thought let's get on<br>and start using this drug and they<br>published case reports the Daily Mirror<br>thought it was of interest but really<br>having had results from ten cases it's<br>not the way forward what we need is<br>well-designed clinical trials to answer<br>the question and Lesley myself and a few<br>others got involved in a consortium back<br>in 2011 with a plan that we would do a<br>single trial across the world but<br>logistical e we realized that that<br>wasn't going to work for us so we<br>actually split into five planned trials<br>and across five different countries or<br>for us by now<br>and we made a plan in advance to do a<br>study as Leslie said about individual<br>participant data analysis by putting all<br>of our data together but running our<br>trials separately so we'd all publish<br>our results individually but we'd have<br>this opportunity with shared resources<br>to combine our data at the end of it and<br>we'd have sufficient information to find<br>out whether the drug helped to improve<br>survival free of major morbidity so<br>Australia New Zealand we were very<br>fortunate we were thus first trial<br>across the consortium to be funded and<br>we're very grateful to the Health<br>Research Council New Zealand for that we<br>the first to receive an ethics approval<br>but it did takes a little bit longer to<br>recruit patients and therefore a great<br>cure kids but the additional funding and<br>gravity and nurture who funded some<br>stuff studies and we were also very<br>fortunate 13 maternal fetal medicine so<br>high-risk obstetrics units across<br>Australia in New Zealand agreed to<br>participate in the study we recruited<br>women between 22 weeks and 30 weeks if<br>their babies were incredibly small so<br>the criteria to enter the study the<br>babies need to be a really significant<br>risk of a poor outcome and then women<br>were randomly assigned to receive a<br>bottle of tablets that were either<br>sildenafil or an identical placebo and<br>neither us the women all the clinicians<br>caring for the patients knew who was<br>taking which drug and we are cyclin<br>issues to watch the patient's really<br>closely and make their usual decisions<br>on when they should deliver the baby and<br>for our study we looked at the rate of<br>growth so were there more babies who<br>grew quicker after having the treatment<br>who took sildenafil compared with<br>placebo so it was a just yes or no did<br>your baby grow more but we collected a<br>huge another amount of information which<br>would we worked with the other groups to<br>a define so we could compare our<br>outcomes we calculated in advance that<br>we would need 122 women to be able to<br>see an increase in the proportion who<br>had an increased growth from 50 to 80<br>percent and that was very similar to<br>those graphs I showed you from the and<br>the observational data now it took us<br>three years to find a hundred twenty two<br>women who met the criteria and willing<br>to be randomized<br>now that doesn't sound like very many<br>but as I say these were really really<br>high risk pregnancies and there's not<br>many women that are affected to this<br>degree and they were severe growth<br>restriction these babies were accrued<br>at 24 weeks they were less than 500<br>grams when they were recruited to the<br>study and that abdominal circumference<br>Center was below the first Center so<br>what did we find<br>well we didn't find there was an<br>increase in the proportion of women who<br>had babies with an increased growth<br>that's a pretty crude measure but even<br>if we look at that abdominal<br>circumference z-score which is a way for<br>us to measure that we can see that there<br>was really no effect on fetal growth but<br>what about other outcomes now we did<br>find consistent with what we thought we<br>might find that for a short period of<br>time<br>sildenafil did improve the blood supply<br>to the uterus so in the first 48 hours<br>we saw a drop in the resistance of blood<br>flow to the uterus but interestingly<br>when we looked at that over a period of<br>time it was not a sustained effect when<br>we looked at the outcomes for the babies<br>live birth risk of having a major<br>problem risk of surviving or chance of<br>surviving to hospital discharge all of<br>them seem to go in the right direction<br>in suggesting that there was possible<br>benefit for these infants even if it<br>wasn't affecting how they grow then it<br>may be having another effect so looking<br>there the survival to hospital discharge<br>free of major morbidity was 67% in those<br>on sildenafil compared with only 50 per<br>6 percent in those on placebo so that<br>bods ratio approaching to suggest that<br>if we saw this same effect in a much<br>larger group of babies it really would<br>be something that was quite important so<br>what's the future from here well we need<br>to know whether or not if there's been<br>any positive effect is it sustained<br>through childhood and we're very<br>grateful to all of those funders who<br>have funded our childhood outcome study<br>and all the families of the stridor<br>trial have agreed to come back when<br>their children are 2 to 3 years of age<br>for a fairly detailed assessment<br>particularly focus around euro<br>development and we started our first<br>follow-up in March 2017 and I can say<br>that we have a hundred percent follow-up<br>at the babies that have so far been<br>approached and offered appointments of<br>course we've got a few more that are<br>ready for assessment and a few more that<br>will become ready for assessment but<br>we've even managed to attract a baby<br>down to Scotland and the UK Strider team<br>have been to assess that baby for us so<br>our primary outcome will be survival for<br>it neuro sensory impairment at two and a<br>half years of age but what about the<br>Strider consortium because of course<br>we've already planned<br>that we could put all our information<br>together will that be sufficient<br>so we've already registered our<br>individual participant data meta<br>analysis and we think we'll be able to<br>look at that survival to hospital<br>discharge but also the other studies are<br>looking at the children at the age of<br>two to three so we'll have the<br>opportunity to look there and this is<br>where we're at so unfortunately for<br>particularly gistic ariz ins island<br>after a very long battle with their<br>ethics and their governance made a<br>decision not to proceed with a study the<br>UK despite starting after us out shown<br>us and finished recruiting before us and<br>the canadian trial is recruited<br>twenty-one women and the netherlands<br>have now recruited 216 but there will be<br>no more recruits to the dutch study and<br>this is where i alluded to at the<br>beginning because you may have all seen<br>the stories in the media that spread<br>like wildfire across the across the<br>globe and i think this is because of it<br>being viagra it wasn't viagra it was the<br>generic preparation but in planned<br>interim analysis of the dutch study<br>after 184 participants suggested that it<br>was potentially causing harm of course<br>that was of interest to us into our<br>media and so you know we fronted up and<br>talked about our study but what the<br>interim analysis has shown was that<br>there were more cases of persistent<br>pulmonary hypertension that condition<br>that we said sildenafil is the treatment<br>for Indian AIDS and there was a non<br>significant trend to more neonatal<br>deaths and for that reason and that the<br>study was unable to be able to complete<br>to show a difference in the primary<br>outcome based on the analysis at the<br>midpoint they made a decision to stop<br>their trial and the Canadians put their<br>trial on hold now I can tell you that<br>the Australia UK trial has completed and<br>published their results they saw no<br>effect on fetal growth but they saw also<br>no effect on neonatal death and no<br>increase in this lung condition our<br>results were presented in Pisans this<br>year and is currently under review for<br>publication and again we have seen no<br>evidence of harm we've only had two<br>cases of pulmonary hypertension one on<br>drug and one on placebo so where to from<br>here well it's certainly been a journey<br>for me it's been a journey for our team<br>and it's been a journey for the IPD but<br>we are still in the situation where we<br>don't know what<br>happened the Dutch study are going back<br>and they're having blinded reviewers of<br>all of their cases as yet this is not<br>fully validated and we're not certain of<br>it we have made a decision to review all<br>of the New Zealand cases as yet we<br>haven't identified any additional cases<br>under our criteria and we're pretty<br>confident with our results with regards<br>to that and we said we need to think<br>about what's the difference in these<br>results but also to go ahead and do the<br>individual participant data<br>meta-analysis it's really important if<br>we find out that the drug causes harm of<br>course but we may be in a bit of a<br>quandary because I estimate that what we<br>will find is that there any difference<br>is non significant and we may not be any<br>further forward with the potential of<br>sildenafil but I think it's going to be<br>quite tricky to take that any further<br>but don't worry there's plenty of other<br>potential therapies so sildenafil sets<br>up there just here but this is just even<br>thinking about uterine blood flow and<br>all of these therapies are currently<br>under investigation most of them not yet<br>at the clinical trials phase but lots of<br>ongoing work so what I'd like to end<br>with is just to tell you a little bit<br>about Archie and I'm pleased to say it's<br>a good news story for Archie Archie was<br>actually Strider baby number two so he<br>was right at the beginning of the<br>Strider trial and his family were<br>delighted to participate in the study he<br>received six weeks of therapy but he did<br>get very sick at 30 weeks and earlier<br>one Saturday morning we delivered him by<br>caesarean section and he was born<br>wearing just under 800 grams he moved<br>almost four years old now and he's<br>managed to gain a little brother and<br>he's meeting milestones and doing<br>extremely well and very happy to have<br>been part of the Strider trial so I'm<br>going to end by acknowledging a huge<br>number of people but most importantly<br>the mothers and the babies and the<br>families who took took the step to be<br>engaged in a clinical trial of a therapy<br>that was was new in pregnancy<br>we had an amazing team working here in<br>Auckland and but of course a huge number<br>of collaborators across Australia in New<br>Zealand around the world and of course a<br>huge number of funders for us to achieve<br>all of this thank you very much<br>our next speaker is Professor Alistair<br>Gunn who is a pediatrician and des<br>scientist who conducted groundbreaking<br>basic research into the ways of<br>identifying compromised features in<br>labor he was also working on the<br>mechanisms and treatment of asphyxia<br>brain injury he was the first to show<br>that delayed cooling could improve<br>outcomes after babies hadn't been<br>exposed to low oxygen levels he worked<br>on how late that could start how long it<br>needed to continue and practical ways of<br>choosing which babies who might benefit<br>his research has helped establish<br>therapeutic cooling as the first day of<br>the technique to reduce brain injury in<br>babies exposed to low oxygen levels in<br>the time of birth and Alice is going to<br>talk to us tonight about saving babies<br>brains thank you very much<br>tonight I'm basically going to tell you<br>a little bit about a great New Zealand<br>success story so pretty much all of the<br>foundation work that led to therapeutic<br>hypothermia was carried out in New<br>Zealand there's no intellectual credit I<br>taste them to say because this is an<br>idea that was first first proposed more<br>than 3000 years ago there's been<br>repeatedly suggested ever since there do<br>you see a baby being cooled you can see<br>the little little cooling cap underneath<br>a little shield to stop the infrared<br>light from over overheating the head<br>there's one of the great ugly secrets of<br>labour is that labour is intrinsically a<br>an experience of low oxygen levels a<br>hypoxic experience so if we look at at<br>blood flow and contractions gives a<br>contraction there is a fall in blood<br>flow to the uterus if you see a fall and<br>heart rate that means that blood plugs<br>the uterus has beat has fallen<br>by more than 50% if you see a deep<br>deceleration and meets us being reduced<br>by more than 90% so is that a problem<br>well the thing to remember is that<br>babies are built to live on Mount<br>Everest so here we you see there's the<br>baby giving us the thumbs up this is my<br>typical po2 is about 20 millimeters of<br>mercury<br>compared with roughly four to five times<br>that in adults I consume twice as much<br>oxygen as an adult but in fact I have an<br>oxygen surplus so babies have both a<br>reserve and major adaptations let them<br>survive labour perfectly happily<br>effectively don't go through labour they<br>adapt less well after birth but labour<br>that repeated hypoxia does help<br>stimulate it revs up the endocrine<br>system it gets them ready to be born but<br>here we see we see the super baby flying<br>flying out afterwards no of course not<br>ever not everybody well 0.2% I mean<br>those numbers pretty it's pretty<br>precisely two per thousand will hit the<br>wall but what's what what happens then<br>well one of the fundamental things is is<br>that just because there's been an<br>excessive amount of hypoxia it doesn't<br>mean that the baby's brain has turned to<br>mush at the time quite quite the<br>contrary so this is just an example of<br>an offer of an experiment you can see<br>here the brainwaves you can see they go<br>up and down that's the baby<br>showing sleep state cycling before birth<br>this is impedance which was developed by<br>a colleague of mine Chris Chris Williams<br>premise exactly the same as the way we<br>measure fat at the local to local corner<br>store and you can see so during a period<br>low oxygen brain swelling has increased<br>because the cells multi polarized<br>Auctions restored and that partially<br>recovers but you can see in fact the<br>brainwaves don't immediately agree to<br>return to normal and there's a few hours<br>later about eight hours later there's a<br>period of over activity of the<br>brainwaves followed which<br>by secondary swelling a secondary<br>failure of the oxide metabolism of the<br>cells and evolving to changes so what's<br>happening is hyperactivity you've got<br>really tough on the outside but if you<br>look closely that's what it looks like<br>you have a very suppressed eg repeated<br>stereotypic evolving large<br>depolarizations of the brain that's<br>those are seizures so we have a period<br>of prolonged seizures here and as the<br>seizures resolve you can see there's<br>actually very little brain brainwave<br>activity left and here you see the brain<br>swelling gradually recovering at the<br>same time and if you look at the brain<br>after here you see severe damage you see<br>a severe loss of of all brain cells of<br>various types but what's interesting<br>about this okay it's all exciting stuff<br>happening here let's let's see here's<br>the brain swelling and so forth the<br>interesting thing is there's a period<br>where nothing much is happening<br>we're actually brain activity is<br>suppressed and we have shown that it's<br>being actively suppressed by a by<br>release of your protective hormones and<br>where the brain swelling has gone down<br>nearly it's as nearly to normal so<br>that's a very intriguing thing and you<br>see exactly the same thing in babies<br>who've been affected by low oxygen would<br>think they recover initially initially<br>the you click think stately stabilized<br>and then hours later they start to seize<br>so this is not this is not an artifact<br>of laboratory of La Batre medicine so<br>question is what's happening in here<br>next clue<br>comes to the fact that in fact six baby<br>sick babies get cold after birth we<br>spend a lot of time and effort keeping<br>them long this is a very traditional<br>picture I think from France I don't know<br>what the hell is the hat is for but yes<br>so incubating babies if you'd like the<br>question though is should we we know<br>that they're once you start looking<br>there are lots of clues that say that in<br>fact temperature is probably very<br>important so this is like a classic a<br>classic one that drowning victims who<br>resuscitated after birth and here's<br>myself and my my younger daughter much<br>younger age at risk of testing that<br>experimentally<br>so what happens if so what happens if<br>you allow that natural cooling to occur<br>the answer is for all sorts of<br>interesting things so this picture shows<br>the brain swelling here we have the<br>period of low oxygen brain swelling<br>happens and were partially recovers and<br>you start cooling here two hours later<br>you can pretty much completely prevent<br>that secondary brain swelling so as soon<br>as we saw that we knew something<br>fundamental was happening if you look at<br>the cell survival here we see severe<br>loss if the brain temperature is kept<br>quote normal unquote but if you start<br>cooling it an hour and a half actually<br>very dramatic protection much more than<br>like certainly I ever expected<br>delighteth five and a half hours partial<br>protection but if you wait until eight<br>and half hours and the seizures have<br>started which is when collisions would<br>really like to wait you get nothing<br>so there's a time-dependent delay but a<br>winter but a useful window opportunity<br>at five and a half hours is a practical<br>time just realize that something has<br>gone wrong to assess baby to talk to mom<br>and dad to get permission to try doing<br>something new and unexpected so it was<br>very practical information the second<br>practical thing was that effect you<br>don't need that much cooling we're<br>talking roughly three and a half to five<br>degrees mild cooling so this is just<br>just showing the relationship here's a<br>normal temperature fall and brain<br>temperature and there's a threshold<br>around about thirty four degrees this<br>has been replicated and in lots lots of<br>other studies so we're talking mild<br>calling we're not talking about cardiac<br>cardiac surgery so given all of that the<br>next question is is it safe I was taught<br>by my mother was this nice lady here<br>that a low temperature after birth was<br>essentially killing baby but there was a<br>tight correlation between the fall and<br>temperature after birth and mortality on<br>any complication you care to look at so<br>I persuaded her that we should really do<br>at trial a simple safety trial so this<br>is the very<br>ever safety trial of a new schooling<br>after 3,000 years of thinking about it<br>with a proper randomization and it said<br>that in turn with experimental evidence<br>for efficacy like the clinical human<br>evidence there was safe - a proper<br>randomized trial here's a proper proper<br>commercially developed water-cooler<br>we used a modified Fisher Paykel cooler<br>because we had Kiwis and the and it was<br>trial to New Zealand the US Britain<br>Britain and Canada this is a this<br>complicated figure is called a forest<br>plot and you I think you can see why<br>it's all Brent branch and Twiggy here's<br>the cool cap trial which was us and then<br>a whole lot of other trials because<br>basically people didn't believe things<br>that happened in New Zealand which was<br>this is a good thing the fact is it may<br>it may hurt your feelings but because<br>they they basically repeated the studies<br>we were able to say right if all of<br>these studies in different countries<br>from competing institutions found<br>exactly the same benefit I mean that<br>that's an amazingly homogenous result<br>and the overall conclusion is more<br>babies survived with no disability wait<br>don't do that to me so for every six<br>babies one extra baby will survive and<br>it's completely normal<br>so we're improving both survival and<br>preventing disability it's not perfect<br>the other five are not are not being<br>sooner you affected but one in six like<br>compare that with with treating lipids<br>and for in heart of Texas they did some<br>effect size of what 250 yes there's a<br>lot of people being treated with<br>lipid-lowering drugs and that's that's<br>normal but you can also look okay what<br>about the the poor babies have certain<br>several palsy a severe motor disability<br>usually hypertonic with difficulty<br>releasing their movement you see in in<br>total 30 percent of the babies in our<br>study had several palsy cutting duct<br>being reduced by about 40 percent here's<br>our competing the competing study the<br>National<br>students of health show exactly the same<br>effect so even the severe outcomes are<br>being prevented the challenge now is to<br>find ways of building on their success<br>and I hate to admit it for a long time I<br>have been the king of negative studies<br>for some time now so there is finding<br>difficulty improving hypothermia as such<br>it seems to our initial settings need to<br>be perfect but everybody is pretty<br>convinced that cocktails and ice adding<br>beneficial therapies on top of<br>hypothermia will eventually help make it<br>better so here we've gone this is a<br>genuine picture from the 18 1898 of a<br>baby being resuscitated and cold water<br>but never never going anywhere to the<br>definitive trials in New Zealand thank<br>you<br>professor ed Mitchell was born in Iran<br>to British parents and trained in London<br>and subsequently worked in the UK in<br>Zambia and in New Zealand<br>indeed he came to New Zealand in 1977<br>did his pediatric training here in<br>Auckland and in due course became q-kidz<br>professor of Child Health Research at<br>the University of Auckland from 2001 to<br>2015 and he's now a part-time<br>professorial research fellow his work on<br>the epidemiology of sudden infant death<br>into amongst other things a doctorate a<br>Doctor of Science from the University of<br>London and he's going to talk to us<br>tonight on preventing sudden infant<br>thanks thanks Joan in this very brief<br>period of time what I'm going to talk<br>about is where we were in the 1980s talk<br>about the New Zealand cop death study<br>talk about the Prevention Program which<br>subsequently was called back to sleep<br>the reduction in mortality and about our<br>current safe sleep program but first let<br>me just sort of talk about terminology<br>when we when I started working in this<br>area and about in the mid-1980s we<br>referred to this as cot death then we<br>started using the scientific term sudden<br>infant death syndrome and now we're<br>using the term suit Sudi or as American<br>sigh suid and and that means sudden<br>unexpected infant death in America<br>sudden unexpected death in infancy here<br>in the rest of the band in the rest of<br>the world<br>I also admitted to say that the<br>Americans didn't call it cot death they<br>called it crib death<br>the this anyway in the 1980s this<br>statement SIDS is unpredictable<br>unpreventable unexplainable tragedy was<br>was being said all the time and that but<br>this was the first reference I could<br>actually find on it and there's so many<br>times that statement is made so when we<br>were looking at this in the mid-1980s<br>sits as you can see here in New Zealand<br>was much higher than other countries<br>whereas the non SIDS rate was actually<br>very similar running around about two<br>per thousand so our total mortality from<br>all causes and we're using the post<br>neonatal period which is from 28 days<br>through to the first birthday is much<br>higher in New Zealand or was much higher<br>in New Zealand then in than any other<br>country and in fact was actually twice<br>as high as that that was present in the<br>Netherlands what's more that the post<br>Lia natal mortality rate that's the top<br>line had not changed over 20 years<br>whereas other age groups in infants in<br>children had actually improved but our<br>crucial first year of life there was<br>really minimal improvement apart from in<br>the neonatal causes from the work of the<br>neonatologists<br>and then better obstetrics looking at<br>national data there was a really good<br>description of of SIDS cases we knew<br>that it was more likely to occur in<br>males it was more likely to effect low<br>birth weight babies or babies that were<br>born preterm infants of young mothers<br>there was a big winter peak and<br>disadvantaged communities and<br>particularly Maori were over-represented<br>and it's got a very characteristic age<br>group MHT age distribution and this is<br>data that<br>this pattern of being sparing the first<br>month of life and then an increase and<br>then 2 to 3 months being the highest<br>rate and by 6 months of age 85 percent<br>of the deaths have already occurred from<br>this cause and even now and all around<br>the world that age distribution exists<br>and is still somewhat unexplained so in<br>the mid-1980s we thought well we needed<br>to do a study and try and identify what<br>the risk factors for SIDS were with a<br>particular emphasis on infant care<br>practices why why was our rights higher<br>in New Zealand then in other comparable<br>countries like Australia and the UK and<br>the Netherlands so we wondered whether<br>we were doing things differently to<br>other countries so we did a case control<br>study so we had we compared cases with<br>control infants the cases were all ones<br>that were certified as dying from SIDS<br>they were we chose the post neonatal age<br>group that's 28 days through the first<br>birthday we ran it for three years and<br>in that time there were 485 deaths and<br>our interviewers did a fantastic job<br>interview in these families and managed<br>to get 81% we compared them with living<br>babies that were representative of all<br>births and and we interviewed them at a<br>time to produce that very characteristic<br>age distribution and we selected a 1800<br>randomly sampled babies and we<br>eight hundred four hundred and eighty<br>five deaths actually only came from 80%<br>of the country those yellow areas we<br>just didn't have the resources to get to<br>it to all the other smaller centers and<br>this gives me an opportunity to<br>acknowledge all the other my colleagues<br>that helped make this study a success<br>the key one of the key factors<br>and certainly was the one that was most<br>striking to me and it was interesting<br>that we started the talk talking about<br>shirley Tonkin she was telling me all<br>along that it was sleep position was the<br>problem because she was interviewing<br>families and identifying these babies<br>lying on on their front we actually<br>looked rather than just relying on the<br>position found we'd also looked at the<br>position last place to sleep and in this<br>time 32 well 32 percent of babies were<br>sleeping on their front but 64 percent<br>of the cases were placed to sleep on<br>their front and this increases the risk<br>six-fold compared with going to sleep on<br>their back this was the first study that<br>showed that side sleeping position was a<br>risk and I'll come back to that three<br>other factors that were found smoking<br>increased the risk by 41 percent look at<br>the smoking rates the 31 percent back in<br>the mid 80s or late 80s not<br>breastfeeding and bed sharing interests<br>are not be coming back to that bed<br>sharing 10 percent of a babies were bed<br>sharing 24 percent of in other words a<br>quarter of the babies were dying in bed<br>with a parent this information influence<br>the Department of Health now the<br>Ministry of Health to launch a<br>prevention campaign and this was some of<br>the brochures and material that they<br>produced and this and this is the very<br>first pamphlet a very first poster that<br>they produced and what we actually<br>you're see underneath the figure is<br>place baby on side or back to sleep<br>because it was the first study we were<br>and sure about what we should be<br>recommending apart from not going to<br>sleep on the tummy that message<br>subsequently changed the back or side<br>and then eventually to back only to to<br>other comments about this picture if you<br>look at that baby the right arm is right<br>underneath the baby and that baby will<br>land on its<br>face so that's not very good and but I<br>did like the no-smoking sign that was on<br>the front on the blanket I thought that<br>was a neat touch we launched the<br>campaign in nineteen and big February<br>1991 but what you can see here is<br>actually mortality had dropped quite<br>considerably the year before because<br>we'd spent so much time talking about it<br>people were actually changing their<br>behaviors in the year before the gray<br>area is the Sitz mortality and you can<br>see that where we are running at four<br>per thousand by 1992 it was only a<br>fraction over two per thousand and the<br>white is the post neonatal mortality<br>from all causes so we're sharing a<br>similar drop which shows that this isn't<br>just an artifact of calling it something<br>else this is this is real in in 2019 P<br>player from the UK and I sat down and<br>back-of-the-envelope stuff try to<br>calculate how many babies this simple<br>intervention had saved and we calculated<br>then that 3,000 lives had been saved in<br>New Zealand 17,000 in England and Wales<br>and 40,000 lives in the in the US so<br>this is sort of in effect bigger than<br>immunization finishing with them bed<br>sharing as I showed you 20 24 percent of<br>babies were dying in bed with a parent<br>that risk was identified in other<br>studies the risk is actually much higher<br>with the mother smoked in pregnancy and<br>the baby we think that's because the<br>baby was damaged by the smoking and<br>doesn't respond well since the reduction<br>of deaths from prone sleeping position<br>bed sharing now occurs sorry<br>sharing now accounts for over 50% of all<br>the problem is has been advice not to<br>bed share as being somewhat<br>controversial indeed some groups have<br>been promoting veg hearing for improving<br>breastfeeding rates the big the big<br>advance we had here was David dr. David<br>Tiffany leach who developed the wahakura<br>which is that in the bottom one which is<br>a woven basket which allow which allows<br>the baby to be taken to bed with the<br>parents but in their own safe sleeping<br>area the problem with the wahakura is it<br>actually needs a skilled weaver to<br>actually make it otherwise the sides are<br>floppy and when the mother or father<br>leans against it it collapses the next<br>big advance was the Pepe pod which was<br>developed by Stephanie Cowen in<br>Christchurch and this is a sort of<br>plastic box original a plastic box it's<br>not as attractive as their wire core but<br>it can certainly be produced a lot more<br>quickly and easily and what we've seen<br>and we reported this to a couple of<br>years ago is that the mortality rate as<br>and that's the middle line over the<br>whole country has actually dropped by<br>30% since to the 2010 through to 2015<br>but what you see there the top line is<br>our Maori raped this whereas the rate<br>had been pretty constant at just over 4<br>per thousand there was a substantial<br>drop which has been maintained in in the<br>Maori community and of course the wire<br>kuroh and Pepe pod and co-sleeping is<br>very important in that in that group and<br>there's been really effective so I<br>started off by saying SIDS is<br>unpreventable unpredictable and<br>unexplainable tragedy the only we've<br>we've<br>basically shown that it's preventable in<br>the mid-1980s we had 250 deaths a year<br>in New Zealand by 2010 it was 70<br>currently it's 45 and we estimate we can<br>get down to 6 to 7 if the advice is<br>followed is it a trip the only mistake<br>part of the statement I accept is it's a<br>tragedy and that's because suddenly<br>infant death is preventable and<br>avoidable thank you associate professor<br>Justin O'Sullivan is the associate<br>director for research at the Liggins<br>Institute his research centers on<br>understanding genome biology and his<br>goal is to interpret the relationships<br>between what the cells DNA codes that is<br>the genotype and what we actually see<br>that is the phenotype his group<br>specializes in integrating novel<br>techniques to answer biologically<br>important questions including what is<br>the physical structure of the genome<br>within the cell and what is the genetic<br>structure of the genome within an<br>environment tonight Justin is going to<br>talk to us about the microbiome and the<br>lifelong effects of preterm birth<br>thanks very much and thanks to the roof<br>for sponsoring this event um it's always<br>always difficult to come in and talk<br>about these things you know because the<br>work that we do is it's not mean so<br>there's a lot more to us than you see<br>and I think this is true true for all of<br>us so the work I'm gonna talk to you<br>about tonight is actually work this done<br>by predominately the group you see here<br>it's led by myself and Wayne cut field<br>in the corner there and predominantly<br>done by Fellini here in Valentina<br>and it was funded by it by these people<br>so there's a lot more to us than you see<br>our guts really quite beautiful<br>environments ok<br>doesn't seem like it but if you actually<br>get in there and have a look around<br>they're actually quite nice places they<br>have good nutrients they don't have much<br>oxygen but they're quite attractive<br>spaces to live them so inside your guts<br>there are trillions of microbes in fact<br>the microbes that are in your guts<br>actually equivalent in number to the<br>number of cells that you have they're<br>actually of human origin okay so you're<br>roughly 50% microbe and 50% what you<br>think you are yourself so you're a<br>walking ecosystem ok wandering around<br>breathing and eating and basically<br>you're feeding these microbes but the<br>microbes themselves then just sit there<br>and live there happily they actually<br>communicate with you ok and so for a<br>long time we've thought along the lines<br>of Koch's postulates which is that<br>things infect us they cause disease and<br>sickness of things but these microbes<br>that live in you and on you are really<br>important with respect to your health<br>your well-being your longevity your mood<br>and the way you develop McCann so just<br>like a city your foundations are laid<br>early so in this map you know it's a map<br>of Auckland City it's a pretty recent<br>one but in fact this mat hasn't changed<br>a lot since Hawkins City was down<br>well there's motorway something put in<br>and stuff but predominantly it's very<br>very similar and so the foundations for<br>the structural aid very early on in the<br>development of a city and just like that<br>the foundations for you and your<br>microbes are laid very early on as well<br>so that if we actually look at microbes<br>while we see is that when you're born<br>and you come through the birth canal you<br>get a good dose of microbes from the mum<br>okay a lot of those microbes oh and in<br>fact in your gut already is an infant or<br>as a baby as you're being born you<br>already have some microbial material<br>which you got while you were actually in<br>the womb itself okay so the womb is not<br>the sterile environment sometimes that<br>we think but as you come out you give<br>this nice dose of microbes in a differs<br>if you were born by c-section okay<br>obviously you get a different sort of<br>dose of microbes there but over the<br>first year of your life you go through a<br>period where your guts change from being<br>sort of an aerobic environment to being<br>an anaerobic environment because when<br>you're first born they're quite aerobic<br>as that happens in microbial community<br>that's inside your guts changes and it<br>modifies itself and so there's a period<br>of your life over the first year we have<br>quite a lot of change in the white coats<br>that are present in your stomach but<br>after a while that settles down and<br>about the age of 2 to 3 when you're<br>weaned effectively your microbes<br>stabilise and the population stabilizes<br>so that you have effectively what you<br>should have for a long period of your<br>adult life if you get diseases and in<br>this instance the pictures for type 1<br>diabetes so people who have become type<br>1 diabetic and non-diabetic what you see<br>is that there's a divergence here in the<br>microbe population and they're<br>divergence correlates with the onset of<br>the type 1 diabetes in these individuals<br>and similar things happen for different<br>disorders so we know that the microbial<br>population you have in your guts and the<br>diversity of it is linked to your BMI or<br>your weight and to other factors<br>associated with your health and<br>well-being but we know that it happens<br>in a very short period of time so what<br>happens over an individual's lifetime so<br>we did a study with Billy Apple<br>we won't go too much but it was he he<br>did us a exhibition in 1970 which has<br>called excreta why things okay so it<br>doesn't take too much explanation to<br>understand what there was right and so<br>this this display of Billie's um it got<br>censored and shut down which also for<br>some people may not seem that unusual<br>but it was sensitive shut down and Billy<br>kept his material and he kept it<br>archived okay and so a couple years ago<br>Billy rocked on it and he said I've got<br>this material can you do anything with<br>it so we extract it and when we<br>extracted it what we actually saw was<br>that over Billy's lifetime since he was<br>a young man and you intruded in it to<br>now being an older man over his lifetime<br>50% of his microbiome has been stable<br>okay which means that as in childhood<br>when it's established and lasts a long<br>period of time it's stable right there's<br>a bit of fluctuation in it but it's<br>pretty stable that carries on right<br>through into your later life as Billy is<br>now about 80 alright so we know there<br>are changes over a lifetime those<br>changes can be thought of as<br>predominantly maybe cosmetic type<br>changes like the subway artery and cycle<br>routes that are being put in to welcome<br>to Central City but it's really a city's<br>industry that contribute to us identity<br>okay and so in this sense since we have<br>you know Auckland on the left here and<br>we was looking for boats but this is<br>like a point so makes a lot of kayaks<br>and different things here because we<br>looked by the sea other cities you know<br>make maybe cars and things and these<br>cars contribute and the factories that<br>make them contribute to their identities<br>that contributed to the people that are<br>there if this is a case and you lay the<br>foundations early then that means that<br>what happens at birth should affect you<br>later on and life out here when we know<br>that preterm birth is a very very severe<br>stress on infants on people all right<br>you go through a period where you're<br>getting parenteral feeding you're being<br>kept in an incubator you're on<br>antibiotics a whole lot of things happen<br>so what we did is we ask the question<br>whether or not what happens to you here<br>affects the microbiome when you're way<br>out here okay when your childhood at<br>about 8 years of age when we looked what<br>we found was that we expected to see<br>differences just like this we thought<br>you know term children will be like this<br>you know and preteen children might be<br>like this but in fact what we found was<br>that the microbiomes were the same they<br>looked the same we couldn't tell<br>differences between the preterm<br>microbiome or the term microbiome and<br>this is kind of weird we didn't expect<br>that yeah but we know that like house<br>prices<br>microbiomes go through cycles of<br>activity okay all right and right now of<br>course our house prices are doing<br>something like this but you know that's<br>okay<br>but the microbiome does the same thing<br>so if the foundation is there but<br>perhaps there are different organisms<br>that are active and in fact when we<br>looked in the microbiomes of the preterm<br>and to term children and we actually<br>looked to see which bacteria were<br>working what we found was that even<br>though they have the same populations of<br>bacteria the bacteria that were active<br>and the preterm children here contains<br>some members of this family called Colin<br>cellar while the ones who are in the<br>term family had a whole lot of active<br>airless stirpes and this is really<br>interesting because the Colin sellers<br>have been linked to serum cholesterol<br>levels hepatic trace or sorry tags least<br>glycogen and glucose metabolism so<br>changes and metabolism our step is by<br>contrast had been linked to protein rich<br>diets which is kind of weird because in<br>fact when we looked at the diets between<br>our populations they weren't different<br>so something else is going on<br>so if the active members of the<br>population are different then other<br>products are making the same well one<br>would argue that they shouldn't be and<br>in fact if we look at the microbiome we<br>should see something like this that the<br>products being made in a preterm kids<br>here they have a lot more of certain<br>things and in fact when we looked we<br>found that they did we found that the<br>preterm children were making a lot of<br>argument okay heaps of argentina's green<br>bars are here and so the arginine that<br>are making is interesting because<br>arginine is a conditionally essential<br>amino acid it's also something that we<br>know that preterm children can't make<br>we're now born okay and so they get a<br>lot of supplementation for arginine the<br>genes that they require to produce<br>arginine are not tuned on fully in<br>preterm children we know fierce born and<br>so this is a really interesting thing<br>okay that eight years on after these<br>children left off to hospital they still<br>got microbes that are making a lot of<br>urgent<br>histidine biosynthesis histidine was<br>also different in fact the microbes in<br>the and the preterm children were making<br>history while the microbes that were<br>present in the term children here were<br>actually degrading histidine okay which<br>is really cool there's a big difference<br>in these two things arginine and<br>histidine there were also differences in<br>a number of other products and when we<br>looked at the variation in those<br>products and we look at the correlation<br>with different samples well we see that<br>the microbes here in the feces okay for<br>the pre terms there was a correlation<br>between the structure of the microbial<br>population the active ones and some of<br>the fecal mono acids<br>whereas in terms it was a lot less<br>vehicle volatiles a lot here again so<br>microbes from the pre terms correlated<br>with the fecal volatile so we were<br>seeing but a lot less for the terms when<br>we look here at the plasma amino acids<br>though we saw this that the plasma amino<br>acids so in the blood the peripheral<br>blood okay the microbes didn't correlate<br>with any concentrations for the pre tune<br>but they did for the term and here the<br>placement volatiles again correlated<br>with a lot less plasma bolt holes and<br>microbial correlations I'm in the<br>preterm then they were in a term and<br>this really is indicative of this<br>happening alright that the guts in the<br>preterm children if we don't interpret<br>this data really should be leaking okay<br>they shouldn't be able to maintain<br>concentrations across a across them and<br>in fact what we did is we looked at some<br>indicators of this and there's a good<br>reasons to think this because our gene<br>is well on the production of lots of<br>arginine and your stomachs produces<br>nitric oxide nitric oxide causes<br>inflammation which is linked to gut<br>leakage alright a lot of reason the<br>thickness when we look and we actually<br>look at products the actual product we<br>look at is calprotectin and calprotectin<br>levels indicate gut inflammation and<br>leakage or we see that the preterm<br>children here on the left have much<br>higher levels in fact there are<br>individuals way up here off the chart<br>that are actually in the realms of<br>having crohn's disorder in this<br>particular population by contrast the<br>terms are much more condensed much lower<br>levels of calprotectin so the guts were<br>inflamed and leaky the children born<br>preterm also had reduced insulin<br>sensitivity which is really interesting<br>okay correlated very well if the<br>production<br>of some of the amino acids that we were<br>seeing correlated with this short chain<br>fatty-acids and various other things<br>that we were seeing whoops and these<br>individuals so our current hypothesis is<br>that the early life events program at<br>changing the foundation flora which is<br>in these microbes and their change is<br>not about the structure of the<br>population but it's about what the<br>microbes are actually doing as these<br>children eat breathe and live and<br>whether or not these differences<br>influence or contribute to the changes<br>and if an insulin sensitivity remains<br>unclear to us but we're trying to figure<br>out ways to move forward and understand<br>if we can interfere with this process so<br>when you think about the microbes in<br>your stomachs okay it's not about us and<br>them it's not about labeling them so<br>there are things that you should fear<br>rather they're a part of you and you<br>should embrace them okay hopefully<br>they're not they're big again and<br>there's more to us than you see and<br>these are people who did it and these<br>are the current people of my group at<br>the moment thank you very much<br>distinguished professor Jane Harding is<br>currently a researcher in the life path<br>research group in our University's<br>Lincoln Institute Jane did her basic<br>medical training here in the University<br>of Auckland and then adopted philosophy<br>in Oxford in Britain and then a<br>postdoctoral fogarty fellowship at the<br>University of California in San<br>Francisco she's undertaken teaching and<br>research and this University for much of<br>her career her ongoing research concerns<br>the role of nutrition and growth factors<br>in the regulation of growth before and<br>after birth and the long-term<br>consequences of treatments given around<br>the time of birth and the regulation and<br>significance of neonatal hi-po<br>hypoglycemia that's low blood sugar<br>levels she's a pediatrician and she's<br>practiced as a specialist neonatologists<br>caring for newborn babies at National<br>Women's Hospital and has just recently<br>stepped down from her role as the deputy<br>vice-chancellor research and the<br>University where she had overall<br>responsibility for the university's<br>research activities she was awarded the<br>Howard Williams medal by the Royal<br>Australasian College of Physicians in<br>2014 for her outstanding contribution to<br>pediatrics and child health and in 2016<br>she was awarded the Bevin medal by the<br>Health Research Council of New Zealand<br>for excellence in translational health<br>thank you Peter low blood glucose<br>hypoglycemia is a really common problem<br>we estimate that it's affecting more<br>than 10,000 babies a year born in New<br>Zealand and it's probably the only<br>really common and readily preventable<br>cause of brain damage in newborn babies<br>and that's because glucose is the major<br>fuel for the brain and of course babies<br>have relatively big brains so if your<br>glucose levels are low your brain has a<br>problem why honest do babies get low<br>glucose levels well very broadly<br>speaking this is in turn babies in the<br>first few hours and days after this and<br>you can see that at the time of birth<br>babies have high ish glucose levels<br>that's because they get a constant<br>supply of glucose across the placenta<br>from the ma the mother's glucose goes up<br>then the babies goes up and mother's<br>goes up with the stress of labor and<br>delivery and so the babies goes up and<br>then somebody comes along and cuts the<br>cord so now the baby has a problem in<br>the glucose levels for because they<br>still need glucose for their brains and<br>it takes them a few hours you can see<br>the low point is around one or two hours<br>of age it takes them a few hours to get<br>themselves sorted out start making<br>glucose of their own start feeding and<br>sort out the glucose levels and they<br>come up then it really come up to normal<br>adult levels until about day three or<br>there abouts but because we don't know<br>which babies are gonna have low glucose<br>levels and we can't tell from looking at<br>them we end up doing blood tests to look<br>for glucose levels in the babies who are<br>known to be at high risk of low levels<br>who are those the big babies the small<br>babies the babies whose mothers have<br>diabetes and the babies who are preterm<br>and are sick for any other reason and<br>that turns out to be a few error all<br>those together nearly a third of all<br>babies fit into one or other of those<br>categories so we're doing lots of blood<br>tests on lots of babies to try and<br>detect this problem and prevent brain<br>damage so when we started working on<br>this problem a few years ago we asked<br>every neonatal unit in Australia in New<br>Zealand we said how do you treat babies<br>with low blood glucose levels and we<br>used this as just two of many scenarios<br>we showed them we said these babies ones<br>are preterm baby at 34 weeks the other<br>is a term infant of a diabetic baby this<br>baby's two hours old and it's got a low<br>glucose level of 2 how would you treat<br>it and when you get that many different<br>answers you know that none of them know<br>what they're doing so it's very clear at<br>this time that we really weren't sure<br>what the best treatment was for low<br>glucose levels and we thought well<br>surely we could do better than that<br>and we set about doing what we called<br>the sugar babies study this is Debra<br>Harris's work in Waikato and we said<br>could we use this 40% dextrose gel it's<br>a simple sugar gel would it work better<br>than just feeding these babies to<br>reverse glucose low glucose levels in<br>the first 48 hours after this the short<br>answer is it works really really well in<br>the green bars you see the babies who<br>got the placebo gel and then the white<br>bars you see the babies who got the<br>sugar gel it gets rubbed inside the<br>baby's cheek and you can see that<br>treatment failure which was defined as<br>not getting your glucose up after two<br>doses of gel decreased from 24% 14%<br>being admitted to the intensive care<br>unit for treatment of low glucose levels<br>went down by a similar amount the thing<br>we were really worried about is what it<br>would do to breast feeding because we<br>know that giving babies stuff other than<br>breast milk is inclined to inhibit<br>breastfeeding so it was a great relief<br>when we asked how these babies were<br>feeding two weeks later that the rate of<br>formula feeding was much reduced in<br>babies who'd got dextrose gel<br>I presume because they didn't go to<br>intensive care which means they got to<br>stay with their mothers and got to<br>breastfeed<br>so dextrose gel looked like it was a<br>great treatment it's very inexpensive<br>it's non-invasive it's easy to give you<br>can use it almost anywhere this was<br>published in 2013 and for once the<br>medical profession actually lets down to<br>this and changed practice really quickly<br>because usually it takes years and years<br>and years and years to change practice<br>and this is just in the first three<br>years after that study was published<br>this is just an example five different<br>places reporting all of them reporting<br>that the babies were less likely to be<br>admitted for intensive care and those<br>who reported it said that breastfeeding<br>was improved so it's a very exciting<br>example of how when a treatment is<br>simple and easy to use and seems to<br>people to make sense that they do start<br>using it and it's very reassuring for us<br>because there's not yet been another<br>trial and previous speakers have talked<br>about the importance of multiple trials<br>well there hasn't yet been another trial<br>everybody's just using it but they are<br>all reporting the same effect we went on<br>to do a cost analysis and this is matt<br>glasgow he's doing his PhD on health<br>economics and amazingly enough it even<br>saves money saves about $1,000 per baby<br>that would equate to nearly about 8<br>million dollars a year in new zealand we<br>think of all those babies were treated<br>mostly because it keeps them out of<br>intensive care but the critical thing<br>that we still don't really understand is<br>which of those babies who are we're<br>treating would have had brain damage how<br>low does the glucose have to be for how<br>long for those babies to have brain<br>damage do we really need to test all of<br>these babies and treat them all or would<br>summer be okay and we thought well<br>surely we could answer that question and<br>we hypothesized that development of<br>children is related<br>see duration and frequency of low<br>glucose levels when they were babies and<br>the reason the different ages are<br>crossed out as we saw them at 2 and then<br>we see it ups better see them again at 4<br>whoops better see them again at 9 this<br>is 614 children born at risk of<br>hypoglycemia in the Waikato they've<br>grown up and traveled all over the world<br>but we're still finding them what did we<br>find<br>well when they were 2 there was no<br>relationship that we could find between<br>the low glucose levels and their<br>development and I didn't know whether to<br>be disappointed about that because that<br>wasn't the hypothesis or to be really<br>pleased and say well we treat them all<br>and they're fine it wasn't quite that<br>simple because when we saw them at 4 in<br>fact they had a 2 to 4 fold increased<br>risk of problems with visual motor<br>function that's understanding what you<br>see in coordinating between your eyes<br>and your motor system an executive<br>function which is you capacity to<br>short-term memory learn rules follow<br>instructions pay attention those two<br>things together are very strong<br>predictors of how children do at school<br>so our prediction at four years that<br>these children were going to have a<br>problem at school so we're seeing them<br>now at nine years and I'll tell you in<br>another year or two whether they do have<br>problems at school the worrying thing<br>was that that increased risk was there<br>even if they only had one low glucose<br>level and if it is true that there's a<br>bad problem after only one low glucose<br>level then all the best treatment in the<br>world is not going to help us and about<br>the same time as we for finding this the<br>Arkansas team were finding something<br>quite similar they had looked at babies<br>they tested all babies in the hospital<br>we only tested babies at risk they<br>tested all the babies in the hospital<br>and looked at whether they were<br>proficient which means at grade level in<br>fourth grade when they're about ten and<br>the odds of being proficient we're about<br>halved in babies who had a single low<br>glucose level<br>so we've moved on from treatment to say<br>well should we be doing something about<br>trying to prevent low sugar levels and<br>if dextrose gel works so well to prevent<br>low sugar levels could we use it to<br>prevent that's a problem and usually<br>when I go to work and say I've had this<br>bright idea guys everybody go hides and<br>groans and tries to keep out of my way<br>because the first question was well is<br>there a dose of gel that could prevent<br>low glucose levels what dose you're<br>gonna use Jane I don't know but I do the<br>first study and figure out if there is a<br>dose that will prevent low glucose<br>levels the answer is there is we used<br>440 15 babies and we do have a dose of<br>gel that does reduce the incidence of<br>low glucose levels but who cares<br>we'll only matter won't it if we can do<br>something important like keep them with<br>their mothers so we're currently doing<br>the HP pod study hypoglycemia prevention<br>with oral dextrose we're giving<br>preventative dextrose gel to babies and<br>the outcome of that trial is going to be<br>do babies stay with their mothers and<br>stay out of intensive care we're<br>recruiting 2129 babies just quite a lot<br>but we're about two-thirds of the way<br>there and we hope to finish by next year<br>but of course okay to be great to keep<br>them out of intensive care but what<br>really matters is what happens to their<br>brains so we're also looking at them at<br>2 and I expect we'll have to look at<br>them when that order but at the moment<br>we're looking at them when they're 2 and<br>the first results are quite promising so<br>I don't do all this stuff by myself<br>there's a big team doing it and lots of<br>people he'll help support our research<br>and I will stop at that point and thank<br>a little flyer for the next public<br>lecture put it in your Diaries you are<br>welcome to come and talk to the speakers<br>we won't take questions because<br>everybody's been sitting on hard seats<br>for a long time please do come in and<br>talk to us if you have questions thank<br>you for coming for this evening and<br>thanks to the AMIA for your support</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
