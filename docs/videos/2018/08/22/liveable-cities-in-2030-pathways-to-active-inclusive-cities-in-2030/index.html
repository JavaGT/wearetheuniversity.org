How can our cities be more child-friendly and inclusive? Drawing on local research and international examples, Robin will  examine ways that children can be partners in defining our collective future through being offered a more secure, active and equitable place in our urban world.<br><br>Robin Kearns is Professor of Geography in the University of Auckland’s School of Environment. His interest in the links between children’s needs and city spaces began almost two decades ago when his own children were at primary school. A small project seeking to diffuse traffic congestion at the school gate fuelled the development of Auckland’s first walking school bus programme.  In the years since a range of collaborative research projects have deepened his concern for a more hopeful future through the intersection of sustainable practices, convivial neighbourhoods and  creative methodologies. With co-editors Christina Ergler and Karen Witten he recently published the Routledge book Children’s Health and Wellbeing in Urban Environments.   <br><br>Dr Alex Macmillan, Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago: A healthy transport future requires an ordinary revolution<br><br>Thinking about urban transport futures has lately tended towards technological mysticism. But if we were to set a vision for transport and urban planning that supported positive wellbeing and fairness, it might look less flashy. Drawing together her own experience doing research and translating it into action, and the experiences of others in Auckland and overseas, Alex will explore deceptively ordinary looking yet iconoclastic transport futures.<br><br>Alex is a public health physician and senior lecturer in environmental health in the Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago. Her interest in cities started as an orthopaedic registrar, engaged in the very wasteful activities at the bottom of the road traffic injury cliff. She has spent the last decade on research and action aimed at shifting urban futures towards health, fairness and environmental sustainability.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

been<br>sustainable significant and the faculty<br>that has posted these lectures as if<br>it's the last one I'd just like to<br>specifically mention Quintin a concern<br>has really pulled together the series<br>for us if you've been to a few of them<br>you'll know that we've had multiple<br>speakers from disciplines across the<br>university and it's been quite plentiful<br>together also particular thanks to Mark<br>Costello who organized two of our<br>sessions on the rivers and the oceans<br>that were especially inspiring I thought<br>so thanks very much to mark the other<br>key organizer James Wright from<br>chemistry I'm not quite sure he's made<br>it along today but it is quite a big<br>effort so thank you very much to the<br>three of you for your contribution so<br>I'm really delighted that today we're<br>going to finish on an extremely positive<br>note I've been reassured by both today's<br>speakers and the topic this pathways to<br>active inclusive cities in 2030 and we<br>have Alex McMullen who go up at 5 a.m. I<br>think Indonesia this morning to be with<br>us today and she'll be talking with us<br>about healthy transport futures that<br>require an ordinary revolution and after<br>her robin Qian's who will be talking<br>about creating cities for children I'll<br>introduce some ancient of the jury<br>it's been going through so first of all<br>Alex Alex Macmillan is from the<br>University of Otago she's a public<br>health physician and a senior lecturer<br>and environmental health and her<br>interest in studies started as an<br>orthopaedic registrar where she was<br>engaged in the various wasteful<br>activities at the bottom of the road<br>traffic injuries left however she has<br>spent the last decade on research in<br>action and is shifting urban futures<br>towards health fairness and<br>environmental sustainability achievement<br>self is a cyclist so you know it's all<br>about the issues at the coalface so<br>welcome tena koutou katoa<br>yo Machinery T Becky for the invitation<br>Norma : t we call Benbecula to motivate<br>Cormack 50 pune rangatira and/or i hate<br>her daily Amir Inga Donnie Mir Tamaki<br>Makaurau ho nor porta potti Takaya in na<br>na or Alex McMillan tackling well and I<br>need to apologize I'm a little bit<br>bedraggled there's a bit of a promise of<br>more of that with with a healthy<br>transport future some more dandy<br>raincoats and town gumboots and being a<br>bit damp around the knees so I hope<br>you're gonna get that this the ordinary<br>bit and the revolution bits by the end<br>of my talk and as I go through this bit<br>of a story about transport and the<br>future of transport I want to<br>acknowledge that my partner is only one<br>cog in a big wheels<br>all these rich collaboration rich in<br>terms of not in terms of money but in<br>terms of the fantastic team and outcomes<br>and this is a changing and growing<br>collaboration over time variously funded<br>by these funders listed here so although<br>we're living longer and healthier in New<br>Zealand<br>we are in the middle of some interlinked<br>well-being crises we have a rising<br>obesity crisis with the cost of obesity<br>and lack of daily physical exercise at<br>around 1.3 billion dollars a year and<br>unlike other OECD those other wealthy<br>countries we have a rising road traffic<br>injuries death toll and I noticed nobody<br>liked that headline on Facebook and as<br>well as that we have the crisis of<br>climate change which is also a crisis<br>for well-being and public health facing<br>us and they're all interlinked through<br>the contributions that come from the way<br>that we have systematically built in car<br>dependence the way that we manage motor<br>vehicles in our cities and through<br>decades of urban design and transport<br>investment in a particular pattern that<br>has really provided an illusion of<br>individual freedom and autonomy and for<br>some convenient access to well-being<br>promoting goods and services but has had<br>a number of huge wellbeing negative side<br>effects as well as the physical impacts<br>psychological and neurological disorders<br>are now the biggest contributor<br>contributor to reduced health in New<br>Zealand things like depression anxiety<br>and neurological diseases so we've paid<br>for the illusion of automobile freedoms<br>individualism autonomy competitive<br>consumption as well with our mental<br>well-being so things like social<br>disconnection stress depression and<br>anxiety but also disconnection from the<br>natural world from nature birds trees<br>and other natural supporters of our<br>spiritual cultural and emotional<br>well-being and this also comes with some<br>huge health and social inequalities some<br>deep and Justices so<br>this is the manga d picture of the manga<br>v dialysis center which opened in 2016<br>by Jonathan Coleman has 35 Hospital<br>grades dialysis stations and it runs<br>continuously and it's always full at the<br>time of its opening it was the first<br>community dialysis center in New Zealand<br>to treat people with end-stage kidney<br>disease as a result of diabetes and I<br>was hailed as a fantastic provision of<br>secondary health care to the community<br>where it was most needed through a<br>public-private partnership but it should<br>really be seen as a failure of urban<br>planning and equitable transport<br>investments that frankly we should all<br>be ashamed of as well as iniquities and<br>in justices in physical health outcomes<br>of transport like diabetes injury and<br>air pollution which have an equitable<br>outcomes by both income and ethnicity<br>for Maori and Pacific communities our<br>research is continuing to demonstrate<br>the deep social well-being and justices<br>and how we've put the system of cities<br>together whether it's understanding that<br>difficult diagram on the left about the<br>relationship between forced care<br>dependence building our cities around<br>car dependence being forced to drive<br>cars which are unwarranted and<br>unregistered and without your full<br>licence just so that you can access the<br>basic building blocks of well-being and<br>that leading to for many Maori young men<br>entry into the criminal justice system<br>and a vicious cycle for those young men<br>or how urban planning pushes low-income<br>households further away from the things<br>that they need to access for wellbeing<br>through housing and land use policies<br>and then punishes them again through a<br>public transport system that's not fit<br>for purpose and too expensive for them<br>to be able to afford those basic<br>building blocks for well being and<br>that's felt hardest by our most<br>marginalised young people not in<br>education employment and training<br>the subject of our cities for youth<br>project which will be making<br>recommendations about urban planning and<br>transport to assist those young people<br>to participate in society as well as<br>what we're finding in our research a<br>shocking prevalence of sexual crime<br>against women and girls limiting their<br>ability to walk cycle and access public<br>transport in our most deprived<br>neighborhoods and we have on the other<br>hand this proposed solution these<br>proposed solutions to the problems of<br>transport we're electric vehicles and<br>autonomous vehicles are sold as the<br>total solution to the problem of<br>transport and what I'm calling an act of<br>technological mysticism Naomi Klein<br>quite gently I think calls these tepid<br>market-based solutions to climate change<br>while maintaining the socio-technical<br>status quo of auto mobility and car<br>dependence but at the same time not<br>resolving issues of well-being and<br>fairness or even really addressing the<br>problems they're touted to fix those of<br>reducing greenhouse gas emissions from<br>transport and reducing congestion and I<br>love how these pictures have only got<br>machines and them and no other no actual<br>people or other modes so while these<br>technological changes alongside other<br>new technologies will no doubt play a<br>part in a flourishing transport future<br>what's needed looks entirely different<br>and probably more pedestrian if we had a<br>vision of a transport system that<br>effectively and equitably contributed to<br>well-being for what would that look like<br>we'd need a shared set of values and<br>objectives including centralizing the<br>treaty of waitangi in health equity and<br>that those vision and objectives will be<br>shared by policy makers communities and<br>academics we need to understand the<br>system of transport and well-being to<br>identify effective policies and<br>investments we need to be able to value<br>those outcomes in ways that transport<br>policies can use to change in their<br>investment patterns and we need<br>straight scalable examples for wellbeing<br>iniquity but as well as that we need<br>institutional structures rules policies<br>and funding structures to be aligned to<br>rapidly scale these exemplars up and<br>universalize them and all of these<br>things have been the focus of our policy<br>oriented research over the last decade<br>so how about those shared values and<br>outcomes well we've done exercises to<br>learn about and centralized shared<br>values a few times over the course of a<br>number of projects but these ones are<br>from Lucy Saunders work on healthy<br>streets some of you may have seen her<br>work while she was in Auckland she's a<br>public health specialist working at the<br>Transport for London and she's made to<br>the objectives that we've been finding<br>in something more beautiful and easy to<br>understand than we had meant so far so<br>these are the things that are needed for<br>our streets based on strong evidence for<br>what has benefits for health and<br>well-being and for health equity and<br>especially through enabling more walking<br>cycling and public transport use and<br>reducing social inequalities and they're<br>all interrelated in complicated ways and<br>what's missing from the diagram I hope<br>you'll notice is environmental<br>sustainability which Lucy sort of talks<br>about as underpinning all of these I was<br>really excited to hear by Twitter<br>yesterday that work on transport Oakland<br>Council have just announced they'll be<br>incorporating this healthy streets work<br>of Lucy's into their planning though I<br>think we strongly need a version for our<br>Teodoro that reflects the treaty high<br>order Mari and the role of manaphy Noah<br>so moving on to understanding a<br>transport as the transport and well<br>being as a system we've been doing a<br>bunch of work to understand how those<br>many aspects of transport and well-being<br>that you saw before and linked up into a<br>system and to use their understanding<br>for thinking about effective policies<br>and<br>to get the outcomes that we want and<br>then valuing them in ways that transport<br>planners can understand this diagram is<br>just the part of the system relating to<br>how cycling works and what we need to do<br>to increase like going to turn it in<br>from a decline into an increase where we<br>found that investment and best practice<br>cycle lanes was the most important thing<br>to get more cycling in cities like<br>Oakland and that when we do that well<br>and consistently across the whole city<br>like Oakland we can achieve much better<br>value for money than building new<br>motorways for example so if you look at<br>the graph that graph on the right you'll<br>see that the biggest benefits come from<br>people getting a little bit more routine<br>exercise built back into their day by<br>biking to where they need to get to and<br>we know that these benefits for every<br>dollar spent on high-quality biking<br>infrastructure can bring back around ten<br>dollars or more in in savings for the<br>health sector especially and we know<br>that large benefits are also possible<br>when we build walking back into but it's<br>not just active transport walking and<br>cycling in the center of the city that's<br>important for well being in fairness the<br>suburbs are crucial not just because<br>they're where most people live but<br>because the suburbs aware decades of<br>urban planning have been most coercive<br>in requiring car dependence to access<br>the building blocks of well-being even<br>when household can't really afford it so<br>using our understanding of the system<br>that links well-being and transport and<br>the relationships we've developed over<br>time with transport planners we<br>developed this unique intervention study<br>for well-being and equity called ta de<br>mujer future streets and some of you may<br>have heard of that at faith the Manatee<br>in Auckland so it's a Acco design<br>partnership between transport planners<br>the community of maggoty and the<br>research team to develop an intervention<br>to<br>prioritize walking and cycling that<br>brings together place making and<br>infrastructure engineering designs and<br>incorporates indigenous ta-daaaa<br>principles of landscape design and it<br>involved changes to streets and linear<br>parks to prioritize what the community<br>wanted which was a sense of safety from<br>crime more walking and cycling to access<br>the local places that people wanted to<br>go like the shopping center schools and<br>other education an alongside the<br>intervention that's been constructed by<br>Auckland Transport and tow designed with<br>Auckland Council and the community we'd<br>be measuring a wide range of well-being<br>outcomes including things like physical<br>activity sense of social connection and<br>sense of safety from crime air pollution<br>and greenhouse gas emissions and road<br>traffic injuries and the results of that<br>project so far suggest really successful<br>improvements in intermediary steps<br>towards those well-being outcomes things<br>like reduced traffic speeds reduced car<br>volumes how easily people are able to<br>get around by foot and by bike improve<br>sense of safety and accessibility for<br>people of all ages and physical<br>abilities but as well as those<br>intermediate outcomes and we're still<br>analyzing some of the well-being<br>outcomes and we've managed to achieve<br>changes to the way that will content for<br>an Auckland Council do the business of<br>things that don't look like business as<br>usual and engage communities and suburb<br>level change for better walking and<br>cycling and excitingly the new associate<br>minister of transport and the Associate<br>Minister of Health and Minister for<br>women Julianne tinta has announced that<br>she wants to put this sort of future<br>streets process and intervention all<br>over key parts of South Auckland which<br>is really exciting but there are still<br>many challenges to meet in this kind of<br>work including how to rapidly upscale<br>while continuing<br>engage deeply with communities and<br>especially how to address the ongoing<br>fear of sexual violence experienced by<br>women and girls in communities like<br>mangry so while walking in to some<br>extent public transport have continued<br>to get away with being an accepted part<br>of everyday life alongside Cayuse<br>cycling on the other hand has over time<br>been iconoclastic a tool for<br>fundamentally altering the status quo as<br>these suffragettes have shown us but<br>also potentially and unusually helpful<br>because of the way that cycling melds<br>individual freedom with social<br>connection a modest opportunity to<br>consume with the ability to be<br>environmentally sustainable and yet as<br>work we've been doing<br>led by Kirsty Wilde who's here on bike<br>lash or the organized and vitriolic<br>backlash against the reallocation of<br>road space to bike lanes shows that<br>while there are a variety of<br>manifestations of bike Lesch part of the<br>vitriol comes from the attack on the<br>status quo illusions of auto mobile 'ti<br>those messages of individualism freedom<br>and competitive consumption that we've<br>all been immersed in for the past 50<br>years but which have read never really<br>it's clear from what's that what<br>happened with the research that we've<br>been doing that framing transport as a<br>problem of well-being can speak across<br>political divides around transport and<br>so back in 2014 after that cycling<br>modeling work I showed you from Auckland<br>it was a national government<br>surprisingly who announced the largest<br>government spend on active transport<br>through the urban cycleways fund and<br>Gerry Brownlee the Minister of Transport<br>at the time even used those well-being<br>outcomes to justify that spend that<br>commuting by bike has health benefits<br>and also as well as helping to take the<br>pressure off the transport networks and<br>relieve congestion it was national who<br>also set up the National cycling safety<br>panel and had taken on board many but<br>not all of our recommendations and and<br>more recently as I've said TR demurrer<br>future streets by Framing well-being has<br>led to institutional change and uptake<br>by leadership but what's telling is the<br>other thing that John Key said on the<br>announcement of the urban cycle waste<br>fund was that the funding for this urban<br>cycle waistband wouldn't come from the<br>National Land Transport Fund and it's<br>taken me a decade to get to the heart of<br>the understanding of the problem of<br>transport in New Zealand has required a<br>lot of analysis of the dominant ways<br>we've talked about transport and how the<br>problems of transport are represented in<br>the dominant ways of talking about it in<br>the media and by politicians and the<br>public and what's propping up the status<br>quo and stopping the flourishing<br>happening so over their whole decade<br>when we were doing this research and<br>feeding it into policy the the<br>allocation of the National Land<br>Transport Fund this is the government's<br>fund for spending on transport that's<br>allocated to walking in cycling<br>facilities never got beyond one percent<br>and the almost the entirety of that fund<br>had continued to be spent on new roads<br>and road maintenance despite the<br>rhetoric and the evidence and that<br>reflects the structure of that fund<br>since the 1950s so what we have in New<br>Zealand is a fund of a user pays fund<br>for transport that says that all the<br>funding comes from Road user charges and<br>therefore we need to spend all of that<br>money on making things better for road<br>users and that's really problematic for<br>getting to a flourishing future for<br>well-being but not only that it reflects<br>an extreme neoliberalism embedded in<br>transport policymaking in New Zealand<br>and I don't want you to read all this<br>but this is I want you to see that this<br>is a quote from the Ministry of<br>Transport in 2014 when they were talking<br>about the future funding of Transport<br>and the use of that what's called a<br>hypothecated revenue in other words it's<br>earmarked from road user charges to be<br>spent on making things better for road<br>users and it's directly quoting and the<br>arch neoliberal s PlayBook Adam Smith's<br>Wealth of Nations from 1776 and so while<br>cycling infrastructure as a challenge to<br>neoliberalism we haven't really got a<br>fundamental change to the way that that<br>transport funders bent towards a<br>flourishing future and an important<br>reason for that is this propping up of<br>the status quo by what fairness and<br>walks and other leading thinkers in this<br>space called the auto industrial complex<br>so we have these very powerful<br>multinational corporations who are<br>influencing the way that transport is<br>spent in New Zealand and in other<br>countries whose annual turnovers are<br>larger than the GDP of many countries I<br>think New Zealand sits between Exxon<br>Mobil and Cal takes or something like<br>that and who have increasing profit<br>protections rarified above<br>well being environmental sustainability<br>and human rights in country responses to<br>investment and in multilateral trade and<br>investment agreements and they influence<br>the funding structure the problem<br>representation why the problem of<br>transport is represented as congestion<br>rather than well-being and the policies<br>and investments and this is really<br>familiar in public health and something<br>that we in public health have been<br>fighting over decades on a range of<br>fronts including obesity else tobacco<br>harm and the entrenchment also comes<br>through representation so that bottom<br>photograph that you see there is my own<br>local regional Transport Committee and<br>as you can see they're a fairly<br>homogenous group of parking our middle<br>aged men that also reinforces that state<br>the status quo so here's my summary for<br>pathways towards a flourishing future<br>obviously a focus on well-being and<br>fairness put at the centre of transport<br>investments is really helpful for<br>getting us towards a flourishing future<br>and I think we're starting to see this<br>really exciting Lee especially in<br>Auckland the suburbs as I've said a<br>crucial and what we've learnt from tea a<br>demurrer future streets and our work on<br>bike leche is that future well-being<br>requires place making for healthy<br>streets rather than a focus on building<br>bike lanes that we can harness new<br>technologies in a really thoughtful way<br>to support well-being<br>instead of ratifying them new<br>technologies like electric bikes smarts<br>public transport autonomous and electric<br>public transport are all able to be used<br>to support well-being we're starting to<br>see great things happen through Irie<br>leadership in New Zealand as well as<br>political leadership<br>but we need the representation of Maori<br>women young and old a range of<br>ethnicities on decision-making bodies<br>like the regional transport committees<br>and it's super exciting to me to see a<br>Minister for a woman Minister for health<br>and climate change and an Associate<br>Minister of Transport and Minister for<br>women encompassed in one woman who<br>cycles including to the hospital to give<br>birth but finally we need to change the<br>structure of funding from a user pay<br>structure to a right to excess structure<br>so that we can fund as a nation the<br>well-being outcomes we want and build<br>the flourishing transport future that we<br>need thank you very much<br>Thank You Nikki and Quinton and the the<br>team for organizing the series of<br>lectures on such a vital and timely<br>theme so I want to pick up where Alex<br>ended and and ask you particularly to<br>reflect on that very potent image that<br>she put up that I hadn't seen until just<br>then of that that local transport board<br>they didn't seem to be an Ahmadi perhaps<br>but there certainly weren't any women<br>and certainly there weren't any children<br>being consulted so what I want to do<br>today in this half of the talk is to<br>raise the question to what extent are we<br>creating cities for our children what<br>two children want and how can we better<br>facilitate the development of places for<br>children this is the challenging gap me<br>walking away from a playground and the<br>new housing development at Weimer here<br>thoughtfully because you know that Neil<br>Young's lyric from back in the 60s I<br>think is very potent I am a child our<br>lasts a while you know if we were to be<br>studying gerontology we would almost all<br>be anticipating a human state that we<br>had yet to attain but we've all been<br>children the paradox really is though<br>that although we've all been children we<br>forget what it is to be a child<br>we might remember rationally what a<br>playground is we might see a playground<br>and have some sort of memories of what<br>we did but we lose touch with the<br>feelings of what it is to be a child<br>it's a sort of a mystery perhaps the<br>psychologist can tell me why that<br>happens but it does happen and so the<br>the challenge really is to try and<br>regain that sense of what it is to be a<br>child and really there is no better way<br>then to spend time with children and<br>talk to children that is the challenging<br>gap so today what I want to do is to<br>reflect on on the<br>between place and these pathways that<br>that Alex began earlier talking about<br>then reflect on two projects I've been<br>involved with and then sort of project<br>into the future try to pick out some of<br>the more hopeful elements and look at<br>some examples from Auckland and<br>elsewhere in the world so the two<br>projects I want to reflect on both reach<br>back in time the first quite a long way<br>back to when I was involved in setting<br>up Auckland's first walking school bus<br>in Mount Albert around Gladstone primary<br>school and that goes right back to 1999<br>and then more recently work with my<br>colleague Karen Witten and<br>others on a project funded by both<br>Marsden and HSE that we called kids in<br>the city so the big one begin with<br>placing pathways I guess as a geographer<br>there is no construct I'm more<br>interested in and that more drives my my<br>vision and teaching and research then<br>the word place because place is so<br>richly nuanced and I guess that sort of<br>a little bit of algebra if you like or<br>equation up there sums it up for me that<br>the places we experience I intimately<br>linked with our experience of place in<br>the world and for me place in the world<br>is about identity and status and who we<br>are regarded as and who we regard<br>ourselves so where we live<br>residentially has an impact on how we<br>are regarded our social status and our<br>identity similarly even the places we<br>spend time you know we're here at a<br>university that that gives us some sort<br>of regard both self regard and the way<br>others regard us so places are a complex<br>mix of a range of dimensions places are<br>too easily reduced to location whether<br>that be by real estate agents or<br>planners or economists or whatever to me<br>places are richly layered sets of social<br>opportunity is power dynamics material<br>resources familiar settings and even<br>personal memories so for me that's the<br>swing pool at the primary school I went<br>to that you know the personal memory<br>part of it would be that my father<br>helped you know raise funds for it but<br>bottle drives and whatever and there's<br>my mother with my baby sister up there<br>and you know it's it's a play<br>that is both a location but also so much<br>more so in terms of children and of<br>course all of us our place in the world<br>or our identity is either enhanced or<br>constrained by the degree to which we<br>experience affirming places places where<br>we feel we can belong and do belong so<br>this issue of belonging and place is<br>fundamental to the sorts of cities we<br>need for children and of course for all<br>of us so to move to some insights from<br>these various projects I want to start<br>with the the walking school bus now I<br>would imagine that that intervention is<br>so deeply embedded within the sort of<br>mobility options available to parents<br>and children are Auckland that it<br>doesn't require detailed explanation and<br>that in itself as a is a great success<br>and sort of source of satisfaction<br>although I I would note that the the<br>person who came up with the idea David<br>in work does disown the idea now saying<br>it's become too institutionalized and<br>indeed really the ideal child for any<br>City would not have walking school buses<br>children would just walk anyway they<br>would have their own feral walking<br>school buses I guess but you know in<br>essence the walking school bus is a is<br>an intervention that is in part to do<br>with transportation and mobility but<br>also in part a public health<br>intervention basically to get children<br>actively and safely from A to B and back<br>again<br>ie being home and be being school and in<br>sewing and do doing so or in so doing<br>both reject reduce congestion at the<br>school gate and of course the better<br>left off which is to make some modest<br>contribution perhaps to reducing obesity<br>and promote physical fitness so it's a<br>it's an intervention that there is a a<br>rationale that has been developed by<br>adults for children what I want to spend<br>time now is just focusing on the child<br>perspective on this when we did a an<br>evaluation of the walking school buses<br>some years into their development when<br>there are were about<br>a hundred routes through Auckland some<br>of the children who we spoke to came up<br>with some amazing quotes and this is the<br>way the most memorable I like walking to<br>school because it is our habitat is that<br>a wonderful word it's our habitat that<br>space between home and school the number<br>of children who said they wanted to walk<br>but were not allowed partly because of<br>safety reasons<br>all because parents just found it more<br>convenient to drop them off on the way<br>to somewhere else an entirely rational<br>sort of approach to time management I<br>guess but really taking from children<br>that opportunity to know their local<br>environment and enjoy their friends now<br>I did get my daughter's permission from<br>this she's now a post-grad student at<br>this university but she prepared this<br>when she was six and it is a depiction<br>on that she put together on her<br>experience of the walking school bus it<br>lets in school and the caption is it's<br>slightly cut off but I like seeing my<br>friends and there again I think is a<br>very important and salutary note that is<br>more than cute it's actually fundamental<br>for the experience of place between home<br>and school and back again it is a time<br>of sociability it is to anticipate some<br>points I want to make a little later it<br>is the space between home and school is<br>like the third space for children<br>between home and defecto work which is<br>school and the third quote I want to<br>give you is from some work we did<br>following up the views of some children<br>who had been walking school bus kids and<br>we tracked them down 10 years later and<br>we asked them questions about their<br>current preferences and practices with<br>respect to mobility and how they felt<br>about walking this is Kelley 15 years 10<br>years ago she was a five year old<br>walking school bus kid she says because<br>we started when we were like quite young<br>I think there will always be underlying<br>habits of walking it enables you to<br>become more independent when you are<br>older it sort of late lead you into<br>different things the people who get<br>driven ever<br>when they get younger when they're<br>younger that's something that they just<br>think is normal so bear in mind what<br>Alex was talking about earlier this<br>deeply embedded auto dominant complex to<br>what extent is that laid down embedded<br>within that first five to ten years of<br>life as something that's entirely<br>normative that's the question I want to<br>put out to you from this so the lessons<br>are from reflecting on this work<br>children's priorities can complement if<br>not actually contest those of adults<br>remember that the walking school bus set<br>up to decongest and to get people to<br>school and back safely but kids had<br>other priorities local environment<br>sociability I even had when I was a<br>walking school bus parent a very<br>memorable try to get the kids to hurry<br>up once and these two voices they had<br>the heads and the bushes I said come on<br>they said no no we're watching a couple<br>of snails will only have sales walk up<br>trees you know it's that sort of<br>learning a and then early exposure can<br>to alternatives can embed future<br>lifetime habits so second project to<br>reflect on for a few minutes this comes<br>from the skids in the city project and<br>here's my colleague Penelope Carol<br>talking to a couple of the kids who both<br>gave their permission for this<br>photograph and also their parents and<br>the range of methods we undertook for<br>this which quite a complex study but<br>over the course of three years mixed<br>methods time budget Diaries go along<br>interviews as you call and where where<br>people talk as they walk using GPS<br>trackers all sorts of things but these<br>are just some sort of pictures of how<br>they the go long interviews worked we<br>had teenagers who were trained as go<br>along interviewers walking with younger<br>kids and sometimes the parents shadowed<br>the whole process out of a concern for<br>safety but it allowed us to really<br>understand the the neighborhoods what we<br>found in brief this is a tiny snippet<br>what kids like about their neighborhoods<br>they like having friends close by they<br>like places to play they want amenities<br>that are very close at hand<br>they want quiet and peaceful places<br>there was a good number of comments<br>saying they didn't want a lot of traffic<br>near them they didn't want noisy dogs<br>they didn't want drunken weird people<br>things like that but you know Nikki<br>didn't say focus on the positive so I<br>don't have a slide about that I've got<br>the slide about what kids liked they<br>also liked school so how do we interpret<br>this well you know I I find the work of<br>our Oldenburg very helpful in this<br>respect either sociologists who came up<br>with this idea of third places it's such<br>a compelling ly simple idea that our<br>fundamental intimate personal space is<br>our home that's their first place in<br>life our second place in life is where<br>we go to on a day to day basis here at<br>work some of you may be students some of<br>you may be employees but University is a<br>second place it's a workplace a school<br>can be a defecto workplace because<br>students learn but third places we need<br>third places which Oldenburg calls sites<br>of solitude or sociability that are<br>neither home nor work but they're<br>comfortable places that all comes from<br>his book called the great good place he<br>talked about places in America like<br>bowling alleys and cafes but what we did<br>was think about third places and drawing<br>from the on the work of Paula Gardner<br>who came up with a more of a fine<br>differentiation of these third places we<br>identified in the narratives of children<br>and the photographs they took themselves<br>destination places threshold places and<br>transitory places I want to give you an<br>example of each destination places are<br>those those places that children like to<br>go into and we could have more of places<br>like skate parks or hit kids playing<br>around on a wharf and the harbor places<br>that you go to our destination places<br>but then there are threshold places<br>these are places that are I guess we<br>social theorists would call liminal<br>spaces they're spaces in between in this<br>case a car park that was busy with cars<br>during a day but once people went home<br>from work it was a space where it could<br>become a child's favorite place you know<br>that<br>was really big in the tennis balls don't<br>go over it so they were playing squash<br>against this big wall indicating that<br>children are inventive they find their<br>own third places they make places and<br>then there are transitory places but<br>transitory at both implies transit think<br>public transit but also their use of<br>these places at transitory because<br>clearly in a busy traffic it wouldn't<br>really work for a child to be on their<br>bicycle there but there has been some<br>level of facilitation for those spaces<br>to be used and those were places of<br>sociability and comfort as well so what<br>is the lesson we can draw from this work<br>from kids in a city around third places<br>well I think the lesson is that children<br>are improvisers they're occupiers<br>they're creatives they are resilient and<br>they will make their own fun and<br>identify their own third places but what<br>I want to do in the remainder of this<br>talk is ask this question can we be more<br>proactive than simply talking to<br>children and find out what places they<br>occupy and transition and make can we<br>actually proactively facilitate<br>child-friendly cities in a more explicit<br>way so I want to suggest in the last<br>five minutes or so that cities can in<br>fact be playful creative hopeful<br>spacious and gentle and identify one way<br>in which each of those adjectives is<br>fulfilled<br>first of all playful public spaces<br>child-friendly cities are good for<br>everyone if we make sure your child for<br>any cities then adults of whatever age<br>or stage can enjoy them as well and here<br>are some examples from down at silo Park<br>in Auckland and I guess I put that<br>rhetorical question up I do wonder<br>whether we have too much emphasis on<br>sport in our society and too little<br>emphasis on play because sport is very<br>regulated and it's very competitive play<br>is free and creative and brings people<br>together in a much more organic way what<br>about creative spaces here's an example<br>that Karen Witten I too came across when<br>we went to a<br>in Helsinki it was a former railway line<br>that was disused and was paved over and<br>it was set up as a area for children and<br>any others to plays sort of temporary<br>ping-pong tables and other interesting<br>sculptors and equipment so creatively<br>repurposing spaces in the city is a<br>second way in which cities can be more<br>child-friendly our third adjective is<br>hopeful hopeful spaces are ones in which<br>children can express care and leadership<br>this was at the climate March in<br>November 2015 where kids were out in<br>front of some of the groups walking what<br>about spacious cities you know Auckland<br>could be interpreted as a very spacious<br>city because it reaches out so far but<br>spacious cities are not necessarily<br>sprawling cities this is another example<br>from Helsinki the wonderful suburb I<br>guess are called tepee Ola where there<br>has been a retention of the existing<br>trees and woods and lawns and rock<br>formations and in between very carefully<br>high-rise sets of apartments have been<br>put in it hasn't been a slash and burn<br>and chop and clear cut and then planting<br>the trees it has been a careful<br>insertion of buildings so instead of<br>sprawl and Otto dominance we have a<br>quiet gentle biodiverse friendly<br>development it is possible and then what<br>about gentle cities I like that word<br>gentle because gentle cities are ones<br>that encourage us to slow down they<br>invoke a sense of intrigue here's a<br>couple of examples from a city named<br>Roger and France that struck me when I<br>was there for a conference last year in<br>the middle of the city square a<br>vegetable garden no people in it I<br>didn't want to be pointing my camera but<br>there were people who are coming by and<br>stopping and being intrigued and looking<br>what vegetable is that is it growing<br>well centre of the city that's<br>interesting and then the trends not only<br>slowing people down because of the<br>case of the trans but again intrigued<br>because the tramlines have been planted<br>in grass and the trams are painted in<br>bright colors so again a sense of<br>intrigue leading to a gentleness so by<br>way of conclusion I think for<br>child-friendly cities to develop we need<br>to consider both the big scale of the<br>big picture the bird's eye view but also<br>the small details that's a very sad<br>playground that's any negative picture<br>I'll put sad Plager in a picture I took<br>in Toronto many years ago I was back<br>there last month it's gone thankfully<br>but you know the idea of caged children<br>with plastic equipment really is a<br>unfortunate scene I think that's another<br>way to conclude is to say that in times<br>of climate change we need more threshold<br>spaces involving elements such as<br>vegetation here's a big tree in<br>freeman's Park that kids called the<br>family tree in our study because they<br>loved climbing it and hanging out in it<br>and they saw it as their neighborhood<br>family tree but third places are not<br>only found and I guess that's my message<br>from the kids in the city study that we<br>demonstrated how kids create their own<br>third places perhaps we can be a little<br>bit more proactive and this picture from<br>London that slightly older children are<br>hanging out in finding that sense of<br>intrigue finding a space to belong so<br>third places can in fact be designed<br>into the city so just to end<br>let's bring us back to right outside<br>does room more or less this as well as<br>the street here nice rainbow suggesting<br>there is a sense of hope child friendly<br>cities can in fact be achieved and are<br>good for everyone so thank you<br>before your fourth well tell me stuff<br>like imagine how that I don't really<br>when we need to put them into the<br>context of our objectives and valleys<br>and place them in the place where they<br>belong in that context including those<br>tunnels<br>well I think that's right I think that's<br>the way that we do need to go and I<br>think those of us who are fortunate<br>enough not to live in medium<br>high-density probably do have an in<br>inbuilt sense of resistance and conflict<br>around that in New Zealand cities given<br>that it's not been part of a tradition<br>but for all sorts of reasons I feel that<br>is the way to go and it can release<br>space to have greened space and<br>interesting spaces and spaces for<br>children<br>I think it says she's like state took<br>well you know I think the starting point<br>is is the curriculum and schools and and<br>you know for all the contradictions that<br>are embodied in the United States I I<br>really think one of the things I greatly<br>admire about America is that they have a<br>subject called civics that's taught in<br>schools and so children learn how<br>society works they learn how the court<br>system works they learn how politics<br>works they learn how the voting system<br>works and and you it is challenging to<br>sort of engage with children around some<br>of the issues if there is no sort of<br>classroom based context for it and so in<br>some ways I would advocate curriculum<br>change as a as a starting point to have<br>a more engaged young population but<br>maybe that's a little bit too idealistic<br>I mean I think there are perhaps more<br>temporary ways to bring a project<br>related issues into the classroom and<br>we've got enviro schools we've got sort<br>of having gardens and schools maybe<br>there are ways to try and you know<br>invite local board members into into<br>schools yeah but I think that's a great<br>question need to give that some more<br>thought<br>I was just trying Israel touch bigger<br>cities come together I think is a kind<br>of a different approach to high density<br>of our kids here is a different approach<br>you're specifically thinking about<br>children yeah yeah well I mean I<br>I think scale is an issue and and you<br>know clear clearly moving moving<br>vertically probably isn't as urgent in a<br>in a city of of that sort of scale but I<br>think you know it's still there is still<br>a sort of a national idea logic ideology<br>or way of thinking about transport that<br>can filter down into smaller towns in<br>terms of the Unruh flicks of driving of<br>kids places which happens almost<br>regarded regardless of the scale of<br>settlement so breaking that propensity<br>to put children to cars so that by the<br>time they get to teenagers they want to<br>buy a car and drive a car right away I<br>think that that sort of is almost<br>impervious to city scale do you have any<br>you know they really want to create<br>and just to elaborate I guess I was<br>thinking of of the word spacious in as<br>much a sort of a an effective feeling<br>sense rather than a metric sense so you<br>can have a place that feels spacious<br>even if there is reasonably dense<br>housing if you have a good deal of<br>vegetation and variety in what lies<br>between the buildings<br>experience<br>I suspect there is no consultation and I<br>suspect that the usual reaction would be<br>it would either be regarded unspoken ly<br>as a waste of time or whatever<br>information was gained would be regarded<br>as unreliable as all these discourses<br>that we associate with children and<br>construct children as as sort of people<br>who have not yet become and and yet I'm<br>often sort of just quite taken aback<br>with some of the levels of insight that<br>you can you can glean from conversations<br>with kids and of course they are the<br>ones who are going to dwell for the<br>longest potentially at least so I think<br>there is a need to be creative and and<br>find ways in which sort of small P<br>politics can allow that sense of<br>inclusion I don't really have any<br>answers on that one it's a tricky one<br>there are certainly parts of the world<br>where there are children's panels and<br>there are opportunities for kids to get<br>through focus groups at the primary<br>schools and executed schools and through<br>the market where we engage the whole<br>families at once including my children<br>about having conversations about where<br>they wanted to go and how they wanted to<br>get around what the barriers were so<br>they certainly involved to some degree<br>in the coded lines of information do<br>much with that but I'm hoping that as it<br>has that scale around the key parts of<br>South youth in that some of those in<br>danger<br>similarly the UNICEF sponsored child for<br>any Studies program which for which<br>hunger a was the first nominated City<br>offers I think some very good potential<br>for that and former graduate student of<br>mine had a Mitchell was involved as the<br>first coordinator of the child friendly<br>City in Whangarei and that involved and<br>you know that's where we go back to<br>their question of scale sometimes in a<br>smaller City it's possible perhaps to<br>sort of find some points of connection a<br>little girl were readily although having<br>said that the waiter might have board y<br>de matar board of the Auckland Council<br>was very keen to include child-friendly<br>initiatives and a project taken on by my<br>colleagues Karen with an open table<br>Carroll involved the redesign of<br>proposals for freiburg place and that<br>involves in very close engagements with<br>children so i think there are some<br>I know there's an annual one but I<br>haven't heard about this year's ones</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
