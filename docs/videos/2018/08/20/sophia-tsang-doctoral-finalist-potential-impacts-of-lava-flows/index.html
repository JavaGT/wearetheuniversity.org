Doctoral finalist Sophia Tsang presents her thesis, ‘Potential Impacts of Lava Flows in a Hypothetical Auckland Volcanic Field Eruption’. Sophie is from the Faculty of Science (School of Environment).<br><br>Three Minute Thesis is a fast-paced research communication competition established by The University of Queensland. It challenges students to communicate their research in an engaging way to a general audience. The catch? They have just 3 minutes and a single, static presentation slide to work with.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>did you feel that one Auckland's been<br>shaking all week because of near<br>continuous earthquakes hopefully it's<br>not the beginning of a volcanic eruption<br>like in Hawaii in May but just in case<br>how prepared are we although the scene<br>is hypothetical it's a credible reality<br>the Auckland volcanic field under New<br>Zealand's largest city is still<br>considered active that means another<br>eruptions possible but how would it<br>affect the city my PhD helps answer that<br>question I study how lava flows like the<br>top of my slide impacts buried<br>infrastructure like water pipes one<br>place we can learn from is Hawaii in<br>2014 there's a lava flow approaching a<br>town to learn about how the community<br>was impacted I undertook a series of<br>interviews with more than 50 locals who<br>were affected water provider employees<br>had two concerns their first concern was<br>that the rubber gaskets holding zone 1<br>pipes together could melt causing leaks<br>their second concern was that the water<br>in the zone 2 pipes could boil causing<br>steam burns to customers both of these<br>concerns focus on the temperature below<br>the lava flow so that's what I based<br>potential damage on to determine<br>temperature profiles below lava flows I<br>went to the lava project the best place<br>in the world to make little laboratory<br>sized lava flows while I was there I<br>created lava flows in three different<br>thicknesses and took temperature<br>measurements beneath them but wait earth<br>can all tun is more rock than we can in<br>a laboratory setting so natural flows<br>tend to both be thicker and active<br>longer than the ones I created so to<br>address that I took my temperature<br>measurements and fit a heat transfer<br>model to them with my heat transfer<br>model I can now simulate temperature<br>profiles under natural sized lava flows<br>on different surfaces such as soil old<br>lava flows or even roads are my heat<br>transfer model I can now begin to assess<br>potential damage to buried<br>infrastructure in an Auckland eruption<br>determining a volcanic risk an often<br>recently developed a suite of<br>hypothetical eruptions<br>I've used computer models to determine<br>where the lava flows may go how hot they<br>might be and how long they could be<br>active I can now use my heat transfer<br>model to create temperature profiles<br>allowing Auckland infrastructure<br>companies to begin considering if their<br>networks can survive such temperatures<br>although I'm still analyzing my data I<br>can give you good news less heat is<br>transferred into the ground than<br>previously thought<br>so our buried infrastructure it might be<br>more protected than we would have<br>assumed by the end of my PhD I hope to<br>convey that message in stronger terms<br>but until then let's just hope that my<br>opening scene was a near continuous<br>earthquakes remains just that a scene<br>not reality thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
