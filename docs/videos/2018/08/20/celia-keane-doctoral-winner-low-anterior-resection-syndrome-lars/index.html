Doctoral winner Celia Keane presents her thesis, ‘Low Anterior Resection Syndrome’. Celia is from the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences (School of Medicine).<br><br>Three Minute Thesis is a fast-paced research communication competition established by The University of Queensland. It challenges students to communicate their research in an engaging way to a general audience. The catch? They have just 3 minutes and a single, static presentation slide to work with.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we all recognize this right we've<br>experienced it before but imagine it was<br>a daily occurrence imagine that you have<br>been diagnosed with rectal cancer so you<br>had a surgery that removed that part of<br>your bowel and then join the healthy and<br>back together after about a year you<br>start to feel like you've recovered<br>you're almost back to your normal self<br>again but there's one major problem<br>you're still tied to the toilet you're<br>afraid to go to new places because you<br>won't know where the bathrooms are<br>I'm describing low anterior resection<br>syndrome or laurs which is named after<br>the surgery used to treat rectal cancer<br>I work in this field and I see these<br>patients and it's surprising how common<br>this problem is in fact I found that 68%<br>of Aucklanders who have had the surgery<br>suffer from this problem so I was<br>surprised when I couldn't find an<br>accepted definition when I reviewed the<br>literature I found over 30 symptoms and<br>18 different measurement tools had been<br>used to report rectal cancer outcomes<br>the problem with this is that without<br>standardization in the way we identify<br>laurs<br>we can't go on to investigate the<br>condition further so when I see a<br>patient before their surgery I warn them<br>your bowel function will change but I<br>can't tell you how how long it will last<br>for or how likely it is to happen to you<br>so I set out to produce an<br>internationally accepted consensus<br>definition of Lars I convened three<br>expert groups patients who have had the<br>surgery surgeons and clinicians who also<br>work in this field the first part of the<br>study involves three rounds of an online<br>survey where participants were asked to<br>rank items on a scale from not important<br>to essential for the definition of<br>laughs 325 participants from 11<br>countries enrolled in the study and<br>we've just closed round three with a<br>whopping ninety nine percent response<br>rate so we have that list of items that<br>are important for the definition and now<br>we're going on to hold regional page<br>consultation meetings and then a final<br>consensus meeting with representatives<br>from each of those expert fields working<br>in this area I see these patients I see<br>how detrimental this is to both them and<br>to their fauna so I'm humbled to work<br>with this fantastic group of people<br>towards developing a definition if we<br>can standardize the way we identify and<br>measure layers then we can go on to<br>investigate the causes and hopefully<br>potential treatment options we can also<br>give individual patients better<br>information about what to expect after<br>surgery identify these patients that<br>need further follow-up and generally<br>improve quality of life outcomes for<br>rectal cancer survivors thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
