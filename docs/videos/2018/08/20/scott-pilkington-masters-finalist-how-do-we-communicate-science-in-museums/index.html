Masters finalist Scott Pilkington presents his thesis, ‘How do we communicate science in museums?’. Scott is from the Faculty of Arts (School of Humanities).<br><br>Three Minute Thesis is a fast-paced research communication competition established by The University of Queensland. It challenges students to communicate their research in an engaging way to a general audience. The catch? They have just 3 minutes and a single, static presentation slide to work with.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>did you know that Jupiter is 1320 1.3<br>times large in the planet Earth did you<br>know that blue whales can be over 30<br>metres long did you know that New<br>Zealand had its own native species of<br>crocodile in the space of 15 seconds<br>today 14 may be you've learned something<br>ok it might not be completely new to you<br>but you've learned something science<br>literacy is imperative for adapting to<br>and understanding modern societies but<br>access to science learning outside of<br>compulsory schooling is kind of hard to<br>come by for most adults they struggle to<br>come across this kind of education<br>because even if they have access to the<br>necessary content they make may lack the<br>necessary knowledge or comprehension<br>through you even able to understand what<br>it is that they're reading this is<br>particularly true for subjects not<br>normally taught in school like<br>anthropology geology and astronomy this<br>is where museums come in museums can<br>provide a unique learning opportunity<br>that builds on experiences you've<br>already had to create a unique learning<br>opportunity that can extend your science<br>learning beyond the limits of compulsory<br>schooling I'm interested in the way that<br>museums communicate science and<br>influence science learning I'm<br>interested in the motivations and the<br>processes of museum staff and the<br>responses and the reactions of museum<br>visitors now because museums are centers<br>for leisure as well as learning people<br>aren't interested in old-fashioned<br>learning techniques so they're not<br>interested in lectures and walls of<br>texts and did things and cabinets<br>instead they want their learning to be<br>interactive and they want to be<br>presented with just the right amount of<br>information some museum curators refer<br>to this as teaching people what they<br>almost already know just like you did<br>two minutes ago my case study is the<br>Auckland medical museum trusts pop up<br>travelling exhibition Brave Hearts the<br>New Zealand cardiac story which tells<br>the history of cardiac medicine and our<br>Tara on New Zealand I'm talking to the<br>exhibition developers and the museum<br>visitors to see how the museum has<br>affected the percept<br>of science communication I'm<br>particularly talking to the museum<br>visitors before and after they go to the<br>exhibition to test how their intention<br>to learn varies from their experience of<br>learning I'm gonna combine this with<br>demographic data so that I can draw a<br>picture of what science learning in New<br>Zealand really looks like now the<br>outcome of my research is gonna sort of<br>be helpful in a few different ways the<br>first thing is it's going to develop<br>learning theory and informal science<br>learning research in New Zealand<br>particularly for our context it's going<br>to help the museum trust to build a<br>picture of whether they can never do<br>this on a permanent scale and it's going<br>to help museums and science learning<br>centres in New Zealand to be more<br>effective and more engaging so they can<br>teach you what you almost already know<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
