tonight to the 2018<br>university of otago three minute thesis<br>final I'd like to welcome people<br>watching from our northern campuses are<br>they watching from our northern campuses<br>Emerson yeah cool hello welcome welcome<br>northern campuses people are watching<br>here people watching via the livestream<br>people watching in the future welcome<br>people of the future the three minute<br>thesis celebrates the exciting research<br>conducted by our masters in PhD<br>candidates it celebrates that research<br>from students and candidates from around<br>the world the idea for the three minute<br>thesis competition came about at a time<br>when the state of Queensland was<br>suffering severe drought to conserve<br>water residents were encouraged to time<br>their showers and many people had a<br>three-minute egg timer fixed to the wall<br>of their bathroom the then Dean of the<br>University of Queensland's graduate<br>research school put two and two together<br>and came up with the idea for the three<br>minute thesis competition I think that<br>if he puts two and two together and came<br>up with this idea he wasn't a professor<br>of mess during those simpler times<br>smelly at times the first three minute<br>thesis competition was held at<br>University of Queensland that was in<br>2008 it was promoted to other Australian<br>and eventually New Zealand universities<br>popularity of the competition has<br>increased and competitions for the three<br>minute thesis and now hell's and over<br>600 universities across 65 countries<br>worldwide which is a pretty impressive<br>thing to be a part of the three minute<br>thesis is undoubtedly a fantastic event<br>it's always a highlight in the Graduate<br>research calendar it's a fun event but<br>it's so much more than just being fun<br>being able to conduct research on<br>something one loves is a true privilege<br>doing it as a<br>at a university as wonderful as Otago is<br>also a privilege the three minute thesis<br>provides our incredible research<br>students an opportunity to do excellent<br>research it applies and it gives them an<br>opportunity to talk about that in quite<br>a unique way our graduate research<br>candidates are the future academics the<br>future captains of industry the future<br>leaders of tomorrow no pressure<br>you lot but you are and I'm really<br>pleased to be able to stand here and<br>know that you were doing world-class<br>research and you were supported by<br>world-class academic staff in a<br>world-class environment it's always<br>inspiring to hear and see the creative<br>way that graduate research students<br>communicate something as complicated as<br>a thesis in such a small amount of time<br>and with such limited props the three<br>minute thesis provides an incredible<br>development opportunity it fosters<br>important skills like clarity and<br>brevity it's a skill that's going to<br>last you a lifetime whether it's an<br>elevator pitch to a boss you hardly ever<br>see or if you're fighting with your<br>partner and you really want to stop<br>quickly preparing a presentation like<br>this serves to reignite your passions<br>your research if you're slightly over it<br>at the time it serves to simplify what<br>we do and clarify it and view it through<br>the eyes of a layperson why do we care<br>enough to do this thing that we do it's<br>remarkably successful at reminding us<br>why we love doing research and why we<br>love being in an educational institution<br>so as a staff member I always relish the<br>opportunity to get involved as a 3mt and<br>to see the enthusiasm and the<br>accomplishment of us of our many thesis<br>graduates candidates firsthand tonight<br>we have six masters and seven PhD<br>candidates competing they've all fought<br>off stiff competition and the<br>departments and divisions to get here<br>tonight's winner of the master section<br>will get<br>Pete in the New Zealand Interuniversity<br>competition and Christchurch later this<br>month and the PhD when when I will<br>travel to Brisbane to compete in the<br>asia-pacific 3mt hosted by the<br>University of Queensland there is also a<br>People's Choice Award and you will be<br>handed out Clippers and we will ask you<br>to vote at the appropriate time at these<br>things you've always got to do a little<br>bit of housekeeping so I'll do that the<br>emergency exits are down here and here<br>and if there is an emergency<br>you'll hear the alarms and we need to<br>leave the building in an orderly fashion<br>and go and meet on the grassy knoll<br>outside the library building cell phones<br>please check that they're all switched<br>off or switched to silence and don't<br>Seamus Richard Blakey you may take<br>photos or video discreetly but please do<br>so in a way that doesn't interrupt<br>anything this is being videoed by the<br>delightful Emerson and so you will be<br>able to see it via that means later<br>there are official photographs at the<br>end as well so everyone's got to be<br>wearing their a game and smizing lovely<br>lovely Lee I don't even think that's a<br>word competitors I hope you're aware you<br>have noticed that there is a video<br>happening if you've got a problem with<br>that we don't need to talk about it now<br>but come and see me afterwards and very<br>soon don't worry we will be getting<br>underway but before we do that I want to<br>thank our sponsor we're very fortunate<br>in having and tonight's event<br>sponsorship by hello world Dunedin hello<br>world of generously donated travel<br>prizes for the Masters and PhD winners<br>to travel to their respective<br>competitions for the next stage I'd like<br>to welcome drew Carmody from hello world<br>and thank him very much for the<br>generosity<br>so you can tell a lot about a person by<br>the job they do I for instance in the<br>senior manager client services Faculty<br>of Dentistry operations services shared<br>services division I will you vote Argo I<br>will be testing you on that later and if<br>the link for the title is any indication<br>of status and I'm pretty sure it is then<br>I am clearly seriously important and you<br>are very lucky to have me here tonight<br>we are also lucky to have Professor<br>Richard Blakey here tonight who is one<br>of the judges Richard is the DVC<br>and ii d v c and e clearly the<br>university doesn't think quite as much<br>of him as they do of me given that he's<br>just they've just given him five litres<br>plus an and so he's doing okay but not<br>quite so important as i richard is a<br>professor in physics at the university<br>of otago he received his BSC honours<br>degree here in 1988 and his PhD in<br>physics from the University of Cambridge<br>in 1992 he was a visiting scientist in<br>the Hitachi Cambridge laboratory<br>investigating single electron transport<br>effects and semiconductor nano<br>structures I'll take his word for that<br>he returned to New Zealand in 1993 to<br>take up a position in the Department of<br>Electrical and Computer Engineering at<br>the University of tender Bree he was<br>also the director of the McDermott<br>Institute's prior to coming to a census<br>and moving into his current role at the<br>University of Otago I think in 2011 yeah<br>he has been bestowed with many honors<br>and awards he has the TK society medal<br>the Hector memorial medal and the Thomas<br>medal for science leadership as deputy<br>vice-chancellor<br>professor Blakey oversees all of the<br>research and commercialization<br>activities of the university so if<br>you've got a good idea hit him up<br>afterwards I'm sure he'll be keen<br>Richards also a keen cyclist he's kind<br>of a reverse Superman of research and<br>enterprise he's always wearing an<br>immaculate business suit under his like<br>crest cycle suit and he is constantly<br>ready to leap over research emergencies<br>in a single bound<br>thank you very much Richard let's give<br>him a warm er right professor<br>Rachel sprung pantsless dean graduate<br>research though again title wise<br>singularly unimpressive the university<br>couldn't even take a role seriously<br>enough to give her a nice long<br>polysyllabic title like myself in fact<br>they called her Dean a blokes name they<br>couldn't even be bothered to come up<br>with anything real very very very sloppy<br>very sloppy<br>rachel is a professor in higher<br>education in geography as well as<br>leading the Graduate research school<br>here at Otago she was the past head of<br>HED see that's the higher education<br>development center where she worked as<br>an academic staff developer she<br>initially changed trained as a<br>geographer and first worked as a<br>research meteorologist I think that<br>means she was all with a girl we were<br>with a girl and it's there she worked<br>with a New Zealand meteorological<br>service she did her PhD in geography at<br>the University of British Columbia and<br>she specialized in urban climatology she<br>licked lectured at Canterbury and<br>geography and she too saw the light and<br>came to Otago she came to graduate<br>research school in 2020 as dean she<br>still finds time to continue to see it<br>supervised PhD students her teaching has<br>been recognized with teaching awards at<br>both the University of penta Bri and the<br>University of Otago she has been awarded<br>a National Tertiary Award for sustained<br>excellence and teaching in 2016 she won<br>the turns her<br>middle for contribution at a research<br>environment in New Zealand and she's<br>just back from the US where she has been<br>a Fulbright Scholar doing research on<br>PhD education and graduate outcomes in<br>the u.s. it is great to have you here as<br>a judge Rachael finally Craig Mead Craig<br>as executive producer natural history of<br>New Zealand and it's really nice to see<br>you here tonight Craig I can't fault his<br>title executive producer sounds pretty<br>impressive to me and I see that his<br>employer clearly respects them well done<br>that's very good I think I'd probably<br>pick up a little bit more if he worked<br>for unhitch unnatural history New<br>Zealand but still that's a minor quibble<br>and I think it's a great place that you<br>work<br>Craig has had a prolific and impressive<br>career he writes and directs wildlife<br>documentaries for a living he is filmed<br>on every continent underwater in deserts<br>up mountains and even on top of a<br>volcano he had in his production team at<br>in H in Zed are some of the finest and<br>most successful producers of Natural<br>History programs in the world he's<br>hittin produced more than 50 wildlife<br>shows and just the last four or five<br>years he has always found insects more<br>interesting than mammals probably did<br>well in a university then and I think<br>that's an obvious sign that he is<br>interested in the finer things in life<br>rather than Grand big obvious stories<br>last year when he was first a judge here<br>I pitched him a number of excellent<br>thoroughly excellent movie<br>collaborations I'm quite surprised that<br>I haven't had a follow up email from you<br>Craig but I suspect they're probably<br>lost in my spam folder and I guess I can<br>still talk to you after this so I will<br>so those are a lunch at lovely judges<br>fantastic okay on to the rules in what<br>is that we are all about here well okay<br>three minute thesis unsurprisingly do<br>this thing in three minutes we have a<br>single static PowerPoint slide no slide<br>transitions<br>no animations or movement no<br>zippity-doo-dah in and out are allowed<br>the slide is to be presented from the<br>beginning of the aeration so person is<br>going to walk up here stand here I'm<br>gonna put the slide on zip over there<br>and they going to start talking three<br>minutes starts from then and we have our<br>lovely timekeeper Susan Craig she will<br>tell you when ten seconds and 30 seconds<br>are up<br>very important to notice that because if<br>you go over then you are disqualified so<br>don't do that<br>so presentations limited to three<br>minutes maximum maximum and as I say<br>disqualification if you go over<br>presentations are to be spoken word no<br>poems reps or songs I understand that<br>emceeing was also supposed to be spoken<br>word so I didn't bring my kazoo you all<br>be relieved about that and the decision<br>of the judging panel at the end is final<br>okay you may not like it but we're going<br>to have to go with what these people<br>think what are the criteria then they're<br>using first one is comprehension on in<br>content did this presentation provide an<br>understanding of the background and the<br>significance of the research question<br>being addressed did it explain the<br>terminology and did it avoid jargon did<br>the presentation clearly describe the<br>impact and results of research including<br>conclusions and outcomes did it follow<br>in a clear and logical sequence was the<br>thesis topic of significance were the<br>results impact and outcomes communicated<br>in a language appropriate to a non<br>specialist audience did the presenter<br>has been adequate time on each of the<br>elements their presentation or did they<br>elaborate too long on one aspect it was<br>their presentation rushed so that's one<br>set of criteria<br>the next er engagement and communication<br>did the Eurasian make the audience want<br>to know more was the presenter careful<br>not to trivialize or generalize their<br>research did they convey enthusiasm for<br>the subject matter did they capture and<br>maintain the audience's attention did<br>they have sufficient stage presence I<br>contact vocal range maintain a steady<br>pace and Heather confident stance did<br>the PowerPoint slide enhance the<br>presentation was it clear and legible<br>after the list of all those criteria I<br>bet you're feeling even more nervous<br>than when you first came in here before<br>the presentations began begin I just<br>want to invite you to ponder on the<br>notion of time and he'll quickly three<br>minutes can pass generally three minutes<br>is not regarded as a very long time<br>three minutes three minutes is a very<br>long time if I stand here in silence<br>looking at you and you don't know if I'm<br>ever going to speak again see I did that<br>for about three seconds and wasn't that<br>awkward three minutes is a very long<br>time if it's the length of a pause that<br>your doctor makes once you've asked the<br>question is it serious three minutes is<br>a very very long time take my word for<br>this to walk through campus with your<br>skirt tucked up into the Becky undies in<br>three minutes can also feel like an<br>eternity if someone's just asked you to<br>marry them and they're staring at you<br>whilst expecting an answer you're trying<br>to think of an answer a nice way of<br>saying no you don't want to say no you<br>hope that a small sinkhole is going to<br>open up and you'll disappear inside or<br>at least it will be a distracting event<br>and then hopefully by the time you've<br>worked that out they'll have forgotten<br>that they've actually asked you to marry<br>them and if it ever comes up again you<br>can say marry<br>sorry I must heard you I thought you<br>said berry no any berries I thought it<br>was strange but let's move on on the<br>other hand three minutes goes very very<br>quickly when you're trying to explain up<br>to three years of research and so<br>without further ado it's my very very<br>great pleasure to introduce the first<br>contestant from the Masters category<br>come on up hi yes ma'am<br>we have yes Minori here she is doing a<br>master of science and genetics in the<br>division of Health Sciences I think you<br>go for it thank you<br>coxa is a riddle that scientists have<br>been trying to solve for as long as we<br>can remember<br>it's a terrifyingly complex disease in<br>fact it's not one disease but hundreds<br>of separate diseases all with one common<br>attribute cellular immortality it's a<br>paradox the death of a whole person<br>because their cells the smallest parts<br>refused to die so how do you combat a<br>disease so perplexing well we're doing<br>it with miniature organs growing in a<br>lab I spend most of my time in a corner<br>of the cancer world known as HD GC or<br>hereditary diffuse gastric cancer this<br>is an aggressive form of stomach cancer<br>that's caused by mutation in the<br>e-cadherin gene it has a<br>disproportionately high prevalence and<br>the New Zealand Moldy population and a<br>very low survival rate currently the<br>primary treatment is to get your entire<br>stomach removed however this is only<br>effective if the cancer hasn't spread<br>yet so as part of a team of that cancer<br>genetics lab I'm working to develop a<br>chemo preventative treatment this is<br>basically a low dose low frequency<br>treatment that will prevent mutation<br>carriers and these HD GC families from<br>ever developing the cancer my specific<br>role has been helping to develop a new<br>model for this cancer<br>which is this a miniature stomach or<br>gastric organ would we do this by<br>extracting stem cells from a mouse and<br>culturing them directing their growth<br>into these small 3d stomach like<br>structures I can then mutates that<br>egghead here in gene in these stomachs<br>so that they become cancerous and<br>reflect the stomach of an HD GC patient<br>so this here is one of our gastric<br>organoids<br>the green cells are the healthy cells so<br>they still have a code hiren whereas the<br>pink cells have had their code here and<br>mutated and in our cancerous so this has<br>been imaged on a 3-d microscope and<br>they're digitally reconstructed with the<br>in cutoff so you can see into the center<br>of the stomach and as you can see these<br>red cancer cells have broken away from<br>the stomach lining and it infiltrating<br>the center migrating and spreading so<br>now that we've got these models we can<br>start using them for drug screening so<br>we're looking for drugs that kill off<br>these red cancer cells but don't harm<br>the healthy green cells successful drugs<br>will then be passed on to animal models<br>and then eventually human trials so<br>these models provide a new platform not<br>only for studying disease but also for<br>drug screening they are reproducible<br>versatile and they greatly reduce the<br>number of animals needed and research so<br>for these reasons along the promising<br>drug candidates we've already found this<br>huge optimism in my lab for both the<br>future of HD GC and cancer treatment in<br>general thank you<br>well done years Minh the the first up is<br>always the hardest position - to heaven<br>these competitions but you and now the<br>benchmark you had a lot that was really<br>good and sitting there setting the scene<br>with a question going through quite<br>nicely I like the way that you linked<br>through to what and how the multiple<br>benefits of the work that you're doing<br>is not only in terms of the human<br>benefits but also as a as an animal<br>reduction for future research - well<br>done thanks yes Minh really enjoyed that<br>presentation great relevance and scene<br>setting and what I thought was a clear<br>explanation of very complex topic I like<br>the eye catch and slide as well and you<br>really referred to that quite nicely<br>during the presentations so well done<br>that was great you set a very high bar<br>you started off with at easy question<br>that made it everybody wants to know<br>more and then you work the crowd the<br>whole time I saw your eyes moving around<br>engaging everybody that was brilliant<br>thank you<br>thank you very much yes man quite<br>worried there when you said it was gonna<br>be a riddle I was always really dreadful<br>at riddles but it turned out to be an<br>important for it or not like the melting<br>something-or-other in the room with a<br>knife and something to do with a<br>reindeer or something which always kind<br>of horrified me as a child okay next up<br>we have rosanna rosanna bonnie is doing<br>a Master of Science in bio engineering<br>in the division of Sciences see here who<br>supervises and who topic ok well I'll<br>tell you who they are who supervises<br>associate professor as an ally and dr.<br>Andrew Clarkson your topic is scaffold<br>for regeneration of the brain you will<br>good Rosana<br>has anyone here ever cut themselves like<br>a paper cup yeah I thought so it's<br>something that happens but it's not<br>really a big deal is it after a couple<br>of days it's like nothing ever happened<br>because the skin self regenerates the<br>body that's what it's programmed for<br>unfortunately we're not so lucky with<br>all the other organs in our bodies<br>especially with the brain in fact once<br>the brain has been damaged for example<br>because of a stroke the kills brain<br>cells and creates a cavity into our<br>brains it's really hard to regain its<br>functions and this is because the brain<br>is the organ with the least capacitive<br>self-regeneration<br>in the whole body now we can all agree<br>that the brain is one of those organs<br>that we really can't live without so<br>that's what my research comes in I'm<br>trying to repopulate that cavity that<br>the stroke creates in our brains and I'm<br>doing that by building a scaffold you<br>can think of a scaffold as a topiary<br>frame a support structure much like the<br>ones you would use for gardening and<br>what would you do with a topiary frame<br>you will put a small plant in<br>you will put fertilizer and you will let<br>it grow over time the same thing happens<br>with a scaffold with a couple of minor<br>differences we put neural cells inside a<br>scaffold<br>we put neural growth factor which act<br>exactly like fertilizer and helps the<br>cells grow also the scaffold is built<br>with particular materials that are safe<br>to use in our bodies like soap and<br>polymers the help the cells grow<br>proliferate and communicate a bit better<br>once the source of grown much like you<br>would put your Tokyo frame inside your<br>garden we surgically put the scaffold<br>inside the cavity created by the stroke<br>in a mouse brain we use mice because the<br>recovery from stroke is quite similar to<br>ours and what happens is that the cells<br>that have been growing inside the<br>scaffold start to communicate with all<br>the brain cells around them recreating<br>those neural connections that were after<br>so by bridging the cavity created by the<br>stroke the scaffold can actually support<br>the regeneration of the tissue which i<br>think is pretty cool another cool thing<br>about this scaffold and another<br>difference with the regular topiary<br>frame is that this castle is by<br>absorbable which means that it can be<br>absorbed naturally by the tissues<br>without any other side effects so the<br>patient wouldn't need a second surgery<br>to get this careful taken out of their<br>brain but the scaffold would simply<br>disappear living in its place only the<br>Thank You Rosana another great<br>presentation I really like the slide<br>again the analogy with the plants<br>careful that made it very clear in terms<br>of conveying that quite complex concepts<br>so well done thank you your time that<br>perfectly you got right to the end of<br>the story when you needed to be at the<br>end of the story I was impressed and you<br>use an absolute that for a layperson<br>when you're teaching science<br>communicating it matters most is when<br>you said that the brain has the least<br>capacity to regenerate that's one of<br>those facts that everybody holds on to<br>and they get the picture immediately so<br>good use of that thank you yeah I also<br>thought that was very very nice and<br>again it's these instruments to engage<br>the audience and yours was was subtly<br>different of getting us to think and put<br>a hand up or something so getting that<br>actual dynamic in direction with the<br>audience to start with is a very good<br>thank you very much Rosanna I think you<br>said right at the beginning that brain<br>is generally you know something you want<br>to use you need it should come and tell<br>that to my teenage son would make things<br>a bit easier at home right next up we<br>have someone from the University of<br>Wellington welcome to the deep south we<br>have doing a master of Medical Science<br>from Wellington Canon and jetty water<br>park we have him doing a thesis topic of<br>in hospital gout flare makes your bed<br>days worse that seems quite plausible to<br>me out of hospital gout flare seems<br>pretty nasty too but we'll find out<br>about that<br>associate professor will Taylor and dr.<br>Rebecca Granger has supervisors are you<br>really good man I am sure than you<br>either know someone who has gout or you<br>may have in yourself now is the most<br>common inflammatory joint disease<br>especially in Maori and Pacific people<br>it is caused by a long-standing high<br>level of uric acid in the blood causing<br>crystal buildup in the joint and<br>subsequently inflammation also Gao does<br>not heal you it creates your world<br>productivity it decrease your well-being<br>and it costs a lot of money and contrary<br>to popular belief<br>once you have gout it does not go away<br>unless you go to years of treatment to<br>get it under control if you ask anyone<br>who has ever gone to an episode of gout<br>flare they will tell you rightfully so<br>that it is one of the most painful thing<br>they have ever experienced now the funny<br>thing is that Gao usually flares up at<br>the most inconvenient time first of all<br>like in the middle of the night or when<br>you stay in<br>at home imagine yourself in the hospital<br>struggling with health crisis perhaps a<br>surgery a heart attack or a stroke the<br>last thing you want to be dealing with<br>the scalp flare but study shows that cow<br>patients are more likely to get admitted<br>to the hospital and they are four times<br>more likely to get Flair once they are<br>admitted the bad news is that we have no<br>idea who is going to get our flare once<br>they're admitted all of our knowledge on<br>cow currently only applies to those<br>general cow patients not the Flair and a<br>sick in the hospital and that's what I'm<br>trying to solve here in my research I'm<br>looking for factors linked to in<br>hospital cow flare by looking through<br>hospital notes in the past years those<br>cow patients who develop flare in a<br>hospital will be the study group those<br>who did may be the control group once we<br>identify the factors linked to in<br>hospital gout flare we'll be able to<br>have to come up with a predictive tool<br>like a scoring system to help doctors<br>determine who is going to get gout flare<br>in the hospital knowing who is who is at<br>risk is extremely useful clinically and<br>it may have far further future<br>implications for example some patients<br>may need preventive medications some may<br>need an entirely new therapeutic target<br>so I am very excited and optimistic<br>about the project thank you<br>that was great that was so simple and so<br>natural I felt like if I bumped into you<br>in the pub and said what are you doing<br>that's probably what you'd say to me in<br>that exact way and I quite like that and<br>there was nice simple steps that all<br>added up to where you're headed good job<br>yes what he said but also one thing with<br>research is often in studies like yours<br>you're trying to find causations and and<br>try and understand the cause of a<br>problem but without a very clear<br>understanding of what it will lead to<br>and you use a very nice phrase for<br>example that your research may lead to<br>and you gave some indications of the<br>multiple pathways where your research<br>might lead to a benefit to a patient or<br>a doctor's ability to treat that patient<br>so that well done and that in painting<br>that picture for me<br>kanan thanks for that I thought you gave<br>really good background on the<br>significance of gout and and in let us<br>know exactly what it was and that was<br>nicely illustrated also by the slide of<br>course you're a bit earlier on in<br>research but I want to know what happens<br>now and how you know what you find out<br>so I think you think thank you very much<br>kenan craig if you meet him in the pub<br>he might get gout so just be careful all<br>right<br>lay off buddy okay next up we have<br>Christopher Chris Kaldur Chris is doing<br>a master of science and microbiology<br>he's an otaku University Christchurch<br>welcome to Dunedin his supervisors are<br>professor mark Hampton dr. Heather<br>Parker and professor Greg cook topic is<br>net formation in the context of<br>pneumonia are you ready I think so<br>awesome white blood cells are the<br>backbone of our immune system<br>they roam around our bodies to find and<br>kill bed bugs that make us sick but not<br>all white blood cells do this in the<br>same way<br>neutrophils are our most abundant my<br>blood so in the body but did you know<br>that they behave just like spider-man<br>see they release these web-like<br>structures which we call mitts nets are<br>made from the neutrophils own DNA which<br>is strange because we often think of DNA<br>as a highly protected molecule inside of<br>the cell after all it's the recipe for<br>making anything a cell could ever need<br>and if it's damaged this can lead to<br>cell death but it turns out that using<br>DNA as a weapon is quite effective in<br>trapping and killing pathogens and<br>neutrophils protect us from many<br>diseases by making these needs pneumonia<br>is a disease characterized by the<br>inflammation of the lungs due to<br>infection and the leading cause is this<br>bacterium here streptococcus pneumoniae<br>it normally lives inside of our nasal<br>passages but when it migrates to other<br>areas like the lungs it can cause<br>problems one of the reasons that strip<br>is so dangerous in the lungs is that<br>they produce this stuff called h2 o2 or<br>hydrogen peroxide this is an oxidant and<br>it can cause DNA damage and cell death<br>neutrophils inside of the lungs can<br>catch streptococcus pneumoniae in their<br>nets and for my research I found that<br>even while stuck these guys continue to<br>produce a lot of hydrogen peroxide and<br>the next step will be to see how this<br>effects the neighbouring lung cells the<br>neutrophils also have their own<br>countermeasures too they have an enzyme<br>called myeloperoxidase and this can take<br>hydrogen peroxide and turn it into HOCl<br>a far more toxic chemical for these<br>bacteria now HOCl is another name for<br>bleach the same kind that you can buy<br>from the supermarket and as anyone who<br>cleans the bathrooms at home should know<br>bleach is really good at killing stuff<br>and so I've also been looking at whether<br>our male approximatly CH by using the<br>hydrogen peroxide made by the bacteria<br>and in this way mounts an attack against<br>the trapped strip Takako<br>although Streptococcus pneumoniae is a<br>common bacteria in the body its ability<br>to persist in areas where it shouldn't<br>normally be is still a problem for us<br>today perhaps the answer in treating<br>this disease lies and helping our<br>neutrophils continue to weaponize their<br>DNA and clean up this whole mess by<br>making their very own bleach thank you<br>thanks very much Christopher I know that<br>whilst you're at University of Otago and<br>Christchurch great cookers based here so<br>you've gotta help your communication<br>skills have to be very well honed as<br>we've seen demonstrated to do the the<br>three minutes supervisors meeting with<br>with Greg back here on a phone call or a<br>Skype link I really like the slide that<br>it's a complicated pathway but you just<br>lay out that pathway so if I get lost as<br>an audience member I can go back and see<br>where we are on their pathway well done<br>thanks Chris that's clear you have a<br>real passion and enthusiasm for your<br>research that sort of shone through and<br>again you made a very complex process<br>accessible to the audience I think that<br>gave me two or three things I didn't<br>know before and your hypothesis was in<br>there like are they making the bleach<br>and that's really interesting I'm<br>immediately intrigued don't immediately<br>want to look you up a year from now to<br>find out did you get lost to the bleach<br>but Richard and not cleaning the<br>bathroom you need to work on that but<br>okay up next we have Angel McNamara<br>angels from the division of humanities<br>she's doing a Master of Arts and history<br>in art history her topic is the in<br>effuse weekly review visual<br>representation demonstrated in New<br>Eiling soldier after war soldiers<br>marching down a street in New Zealand<br>these images are from the weekly review<br>series a newsreel that screened here in<br>film unit these films became familiar to<br>everyone around the country now when you<br>listen to the voiceover it represents<br>nation-building it's about a country<br>coming together and doing its part for<br>the war it demonstrated New Zealand to<br>New Zealanders for the decade they were<br>made however it's important to consider<br>the influence of newsreels and<br>documentaries as it can be taken for<br>granted if you change what is said in<br>the voice over the visual representation<br>of the images shift meaning the<br>voice-over tells the audience what the<br>images represent therefore it's<br>important to consider the influence of<br>newsreels in a historical perspective as<br>it gives us a better understanding of<br>the target audience they're dressing as<br>well as the people behind the scenes now<br>when it comes to the National Film unit<br>it's been written that John Grierson who<br>led the documentary movement influenced<br>the film unit here he was invited to New<br>Zealand in 1940 to discuss with the<br>Labour government how they should<br>reorganize their film unit which<br>resulted in the weekly review having a<br>gross in Ian's approach however there is<br>a question Grierson's report was never<br>implemented so how good the weekly<br>review have accros Indian approach well<br>it turns out that Stanhope Andrews who<br>becomes a founder and producer of the<br>national film unit in 1941 is a person<br>responsible he had a background in<br>education and was really interested in<br>film especially the documentary movement<br>when Griffin came here in 1940 they met<br>they discussed the social conditions of<br>the country and education and how it<br>could be applied to film when he found<br>out that Grayson's report wasn't<br>implemented he decided to rewrite that<br>report and he was very persistent he<br>argued that a documentary style newsreel<br>could benefit the Labour government's<br>platform and his persistence helped the<br>weekly Ruby began production now when<br>the national government was elected in<br>1949 it resulted in Andrews resigning<br>from his position and then dismantling<br>the weekly review they didn't want<br>anything to do with the Labour<br>government's platform which they decided<br>to make their own newsreel the pictorial<br>parade<br>so overall<br>the influence of newsreels are important<br>in understanding our historical records<br>as well as gaining a better perspective<br>thanks angel love the images there and<br>really you really got us to think about<br>not just the images but the voice that<br>goes alongside it so a great story<br>unfold a 3d presentation quite like the<br>emotion and passion angel that was great<br>it means a lot to you we could see that<br>and that made us care too and that would<br>sounds like fantastic investigative<br>journalism you're doing virtually so I'm<br>intrigued to see more and then read your<br>finished work thank you<br>yeah great and it's it's a weaving in of<br>that national story with the within the<br>public story with the political insights<br>and undertones that go with it so again<br>I've gained something from that and<br>understanding how media in in that age<br>effects politics again we reflect on<br>that in current times as well thank you<br>very much<br>thank you very much that was great this<br>is a celebratory affair so I don't think<br>we should reflect too much on the media<br>and current times and how it affects<br>politics maybe draw a veil over that and<br>next up we have from the marketing<br>department doing a Master of Commerce<br>marketing management we have our new one<br>and topic for her thesis is orientations<br>to happiness and sustainable consumption<br>I am looking forward to this I don't<br>know much about sustainable consumption<br>I know quite a lot about unsustainable<br>consumption and I'm quite the expert on<br>that but I'm sure very soon we will have<br>an all ready to go so please all give<br>her a warm welcome<br>people how can you convince people to<br>save water energy or to give up their<br>car has been a challenge for decades<br>since we set our goals to go<br>sustainability because you're basically<br>asking people to give up to make a<br>personal sacrifice of the highest order<br>to give up their comfort and convenience<br>for an austere bleak and need to<br>substitute it makes more sense to tell<br>us to drive this car designed for your<br>driving pleasure than to drive to write<br>a pie every day instead with emphasis I<br>want to find an answer to this question<br>do we have to give up our happiness for<br>the next generations well-being but<br>first what is happiness for the hedonist<br>happiness means maximizing pleasure and<br>avoiding pain and this is the marketers<br>favorite rhetoric by this and you will<br>be happy but happiness means much more<br>than sheer pleasure a happy life also<br>serves a higher purpose it means doing<br>things the matter and creating a legacy<br>you can also become happy by challenging<br>yourself fighting your flows in doing<br>things that you love the three pathway<br>I'll talk about are calm the three<br>orientations or approaches to happiness<br>my research examines how th of the<br>approaches meaning engagement and<br>pleasure relate to peoples adoption of<br>environmentally and socially responsible<br>responsible behavior the fighting among<br>New Zealanders showed that when people<br>enrich their life with meaning and<br>engagement they are also more likely to<br>care for the planet and the society in<br>systole even the pleasure pathway does<br>not conflict with sustainable living<br>either even if your life motto is<br>maximizing pleasure<br>it does not stop you from being a friend<br>of the earth why is that it turns out<br>that nobody can be truly happy by taking<br>the pleasure pathway alone the happiness<br>people fill their life with meaningful<br>with pleasurable and engaging activities<br>and those who live their life to the<br>fullest are also the ones who are most<br>likely to be sustainable this perfectly<br>resonates a Buddhist wisdom saying that<br>set your heart on doing good and you<br>will be filled with joy that makes<br>perfect sense because you can find your<br>pleasure when celebrating a plastic free<br>july standing up the compost are less<br>than the heat enjoy the winter and so<br>overall it leads to over a positive<br>implication but if we can frame<br>sustainable consumption as many fold it<br>is engaging we don't have to trade off<br>our happiness for build to build a<br>sustainable common future for all thank<br>you<br>and that was great I loved the<br>philosophical approach it gave me<br>something to think about I'll be driving<br>home thinking about that and it's got a<br>circular factor to it that I was very<br>intrigued by I thought you explained it<br>well thank you thank you yes I thought<br>that was very good and I just want to<br>comment on your slide the sliders are<br>very engaging and you've got you used a<br>very good instrument there because<br>you've got us reading and engaging in<br>your presentation before you even say<br>anything I was focusing on meaning Plus<br>engagement / + pleasure even before you<br>started and then you talked me and<br>walked me through the way that that has<br>an impact on happiness and sustainable<br>consumption so well done that's a very<br>very well constructed slide agreed I<br>love the slide thanks on also the links<br>as well we're really good for me and I<br>love the way you move and the Buddhist<br>saying and it's going to make me think<br>about lessening the heat and enjoying<br>one two more yeah yes well so thank you<br>I thought you did the definitions really<br>well too so we're very clear about what<br>you're talking about for each element of<br>I understand there are a bit of<br>fisticuffs amongst the judges but<br>they've sort of themselves out haven't<br>you no okay all right<br>nevertheless we will draw a veil over<br>there and start with the doctoral<br>candidates so for this next part we have<br>got seven doctoral candidates who are<br>going to present on their research and<br>we're starting with Alastair Richardson<br>Alastair is doing his PhD in chemistry<br>obviously in the division of Sciences<br>his supervisor is Nigel Perry and his<br>topic is the transport of vitamin C<br>giving apples a healthy boost when it<br>comes to eating a healthy diet we all<br>know it's important to eat up fresh<br>fruit and vegetables in other words<br>we've got to read a lot of plants now<br>the reason we have to include all these<br>plants in our diet is because they<br>contain a variety of vitamins and<br>minerals that allow our bodies to<br>function correctly one of the most<br>important things that we can get from<br>these plants is bitumen see now most<br>people think about bitumen see they'll<br>ask themselves am I getting enough of it<br>what foods can I get it from and does it<br>keep me healthy not many people stop to<br>consider how that vitamin C gets into<br>their food in the first place so for my<br>PhD I'm working with apples and I'm<br>trying to understand how vitamin C<br>accumulates in the fruits of the plant<br>so that we can get the most out of every<br>apple that we eat so previous research<br>has shown that the primary site for the<br>synthesis of vitamin C is actually in<br>the leaves of the apple tree now that<br>would be great if we were talking about<br>a plant such as spinach or lettuce or<br>even kale because in those cases we eat<br>the leaves but for apples we obviously<br>want to eat the fruit and therefore it's<br>important to understand how all that<br>vitamin C being produced by the leaves<br>is getting transported and reaching the<br>fruit so that we can eat it so working<br>with plant and food research I've<br>identified a new molecule which has<br>never been found in Apple's before this<br>molecule consists of vitamin C which you<br>can see on the slide in blue and it's<br>attached to a glucose unit which you can<br>see in red now this molecule has two<br>things that you need to know about it<br>the first thing is that it's extremely<br>stable so it's far more stable than<br>Betterman C by itself therefore if it<br>were to move through all these different<br>plant<br>much less if it would break down than if<br>we were transporting bitumen see by<br>itself so based on these findings the<br>second thing that you need to know about<br>this molecule is that I can detect it<br>and the set of every single Apple<br>variety that I have sampled now the fact<br>that it's present in the sap is exciting<br>because the sap is what plants use to<br>transport their resources from one place<br>to another so based on these findings it<br>is my hypothesis the vitamin C is<br>synthesized in the leaves of our apple<br>trees where a glucose unit is then<br>attached to it this new molecule moves<br>into the set and is transported towards<br>the fruit where the glucose unit is<br>removed and vitamin C is released into<br>our apples so we can eat it<br>now if I can provide the evidence<br>necessary to demonstrate that this<br>process really is occurring in our<br>apples it may allow us to selectively<br>breed a new variety of apples with<br>elevated concentrations of vitamin C not<br>only would such an apple variety be<br>nutritionally valuable but it would also<br>add commercial value to a popular and<br>well-established New Zealand crop thank<br>you see we're fighting over the<br>microphone now so that's great again I<br>got engagement from your slide straight<br>away but the in your presentation<br>required me to interpret that and again<br>you use nice definitive language you've<br>discovered something new and it's<br>detected in every variety of you seen<br>and then it's a hypothesis of where this<br>can lead to so the language was perfect<br>your stage presence was good so well<br>done agreed thanks Alistair you had a<br>great engaging start to that<br>presentation and the very simple graphic<br>powerful story something we can all<br>relate to so thank you thank you have<br>you named the molecule well it has a<br>very long and rather boring chemical<br>name but we weren't good it's okay I<br>thought that was great you had a<br>question you had a hint of an answer you<br>had a hypothesis at the back end you<br>showed what might come from this I look<br>forward to seeing it in the supermarket<br>a couple years from now that was also<br>thank you cheers thank you thank you<br>very much<br>Alistair what I took from that that<br>doughnuts are a plant and you need to<br>eat more plants so I'm really happy<br>about that thank you<br>excellent research right next up we have<br>email Lyons email as doing a PhD in<br>English in linguistics the division of<br>humanities supervisors our associate<br>professor Jacob Edmund and dr. M O'Neill<br>and topic is shaming the personal and<br>queer lyric poetry are you good to go<br>yes awesome when my mother reads one of<br>my poems written with the personal<br>pronoun I and uses the word queer to<br>describe myself she gets all worked up<br>all don't be shown this to your auntie<br>and only upset her my mother doesn't<br>care that the LGBTQI community have<br>reclaimed queer or that when a poet<br>writes a poem using I it's not<br>necessarily their perspective the kind<br>of poetry that uses a personal pronoun<br>is usually associated with the lyric<br>tradition lyric poetry represents to<br>paraphrase Helen Wendla and inner life<br>in such a way that it is assumable by<br>others in this sense the eye is a<br>vehicle for representative rather than<br>purely subjective experience then why<br>does my mother feel so ashamed when she<br>reads my poetry because when the<br>personal pronoun is combined with ultra<br>biographical details the reader knows<br>about the Polish then they start to<br>question the relationship between the<br>poem and the poet they begin to identify<br>the lyric self with the poets public<br>self we call this process of<br>identification lyric reading and in<br>literary studies has been repressed and<br>shamed yes as Jillian white has argued<br>there is value in allowing and exploring<br>the show<br>of lyric reading this idea of revaluing<br>shame comes from queer studies which<br>have sought revalue a shaming queer<br>people have been subjected to by<br>society's prejudiced against them queer<br>studies asks what might we learn from<br>paying attention to the experience of<br>shame rather than merely trying to<br>overcome it in my creative critical<br>thesis I will use this scholarship to<br>look at the shaming of the personal in<br>poetry written by queer women I believe<br>shame is crucial in creating space for<br>their bodies and perspectives that have<br>long been excluded from the Western<br>poetic tradition I use autobiographical<br>details in my creative component a book<br>of poems and in my critical thesis in<br>order to try and resist this exclusion<br>and to create a culture of openness to<br>questions about shame questions that are<br>not just important to poetry my mother<br>asks me what happened to the gay girl<br>Moira in The Handmaid's Tale she won't<br>watch the television adaptation of the<br>book she's afraid her fears from Moira<br>would be confirmed she's afraid of what<br>the world will do to Moira or to me when<br>we insist on presenting ourselves so<br>shamelessly thank you<br>EEMA I really loved the dramatic account<br>of your research you know some very<br>complex ideas but you made them very<br>personal and relevant to us through your<br>use of you know your mother and auntie's<br>and so forth so I thought that was just<br>an excellent way to talk about very<br>complex ideas that were accessible to us<br>thank you yeah that was great I actually<br>forgot you were talking about your<br>thesis I thought you're just telling me<br>something that we all ought to think<br>about a bit and I thought that was good<br>I was totally there I forgot your slide<br>is brilliant that was good I'd like to<br>hear more about it yeah I thought that<br>was very very engaging and again right<br>from the slide we knew you know<br>something complex and deep for you but<br>actually there's a little bit of Liberty<br>there as well so we knew we were not<br>going to be not going to be taken too<br>deep but there was a light surface to<br>have and so well done thank you very<br>much thank you very much EEMA let me<br>assure you that our mothers shame<br>extends way beyond poetry okay next up<br>we have from the department of general<br>practice and rural health jessica young<br>JISC Young's doing a PhD her supervisors<br>are associate professor Krystal J dr.<br>Richard Egan Toni Egan and dr. Janine<br>water winters her topic is what I<br>learned from dying people what is the<br>one thing we all have in common we don't<br>like to talk about it but we will all<br>die what berries though is our<br>preference for how we die there are some<br>people with terminal illnesses who wish<br>to hasten midi through euthanasia or<br>assisted dying assisted dying is highly<br>topical given the fact that we have an<br>end of life choice bill in front of<br>parliament at the moment but<br>unbelievably the very people who would<br>be eligible for any such law have not<br>been the subject of research in New<br>Zealand here's where I come in<br>I am conducting the first New Zealand<br>study of the wish to hasten death and<br>the terminally ill is a miracle<br>sociologist I'm interested in how and<br>why people try to actively shape their<br>own deaths what are the social and<br>cultural value systems that people draw<br>on to make sense of wanting assisted<br>dying to answer these questions are<br>interviewed 14 people with approximately<br>listening yet enough sex that their<br>family members also took part in these<br>interviews now you may think it's<br>depressing to talk to people who are<br>waiting for death the interviews were<br>hugely enlightening and they learned a<br>lot about life and death some of which<br>I'd like to share with you today one<br>people reflect on the purpose and<br>meaning of life as they come to the end<br>of it participants talked about about a<br>huge range of things bringing them<br>purpose in meaning to what surprised me<br>about the people I talked to was how<br>accepting of death most of them were now<br>this shouldn't be confused with<br>welcoming death I liked how one<br>participant put it leading death come to<br>you by accepting and preparing for death<br>participants could actually get on with<br>living and 3 I learned that there are<br>some ways of living that are worse than<br>death participants talked about when<br>their quality of life no longer<br>outweighed the prospect of the idea this<br>was the right time for them to choose to<br>die paradoxically participants expressed<br>a desire to live just not in this way<br>research that explores New Zealanders<br>motivations for considering an assisted<br>deal is necessary to shed light on what<br>it means to die in New Zealand today I<br>think it's important that we understand<br>the issue of assisted dying from the<br>people who are approaching the end of<br>life this knowledge can help inform<br>societal and political debate assisted<br>dying is something that we should all<br>care about because if we legalize it<br>that will inevitably change the<br>landscape and how we die and because we<br>all die this is an issue that affects us<br>you had me engaged with the title that<br>was a book on a shelf in the bookstore<br>everybody buying it that was fascinating<br>meaningful and right at the crux of who<br>we are and what we are and how we are so<br>I was fully engaged nice simple pace you<br>know you weren't rushing it<br>you were happy you know it's sort of<br>this draws of emotional feelings in<br>people but you kept a nice tone so very<br>nice work thank you<br>yeah I'd like to reflect on your slide<br>as well not just the title but the<br>choice of the of the iconography with it<br>I was just reflecting on you know the<br>meaning of the times that I've set and<br>stared at there and wondered about the<br>meaning of life myself more than three<br>minutes that that little thing will go<br>around also just in terms of the<br>vehicles you use again pulling something<br>in a contemporary context about about a<br>legislative need and and informing that<br>legislation through through research but<br>that the experiences of real people can<br>affect policy and and again it's<br>relevant to a source I thank you for<br>that thanks Jessica<br>great presentation very well executed<br>beautifully timed I like the way you<br>started with the relevance to us in and<br>brought us back to that at the end and<br>also the way you very clearly outlined<br>your findings three you know concrete<br>findings so far so that was great<br>dissemination of your research findings<br>thank you very much Jessica next up we<br>have Macmillan max doing PhD in<br>economics division of Commerce he's<br>doing a global analysis of public<br>spending on education his supervisors<br>are David fielding and Dorian Owen and<br>he is going to use this mic don't do a<br>mic drop here you go<br>okay hello everyone thank you for being<br>here tonight<br>so an enduring question I had as I read<br>through much literature about national<br>level public spending on education<br>what's the following what do we really<br>know about the public spending patterns<br>of richer developed countries versus<br>poorer developing or lesser developed<br>countries using data from the World Bank<br>the International Monetary Fund Freedom<br>House Center for systemic piece and pen<br>world tables all things being equal what<br>I generally have found can be summarized<br>in the form of three simple propositions<br>inequality propositions now for those of<br>you who are more mathematically oriented<br>I use notation in the red top font<br>however for those of you who are more<br>visual spatial oriented I use part<br>charts where the blue part of the paw<br>has reference in each case proposition 1<br>says that richer countries spend more<br>than poorer countries in national effort<br>terms however richer countries spend<br>less than poorer countries in budget<br>share terms and by implication<br>proposition 3 results which essentially<br>says that richer countries have larger<br>public sectors then do poorer countries<br>the interesting thing though about these<br>propositions is that they validate or<br>justify are now very well known theory<br>of public economics called vogner's law<br>after the German economist Adel Faulkner<br>which essentially postulates that as<br>countries grow and develop the size of<br>their public sectors grow<br>the reasons for why these patterns come<br>about are basically twofold one the<br>extent to which countries are fiscally<br>or supply-side constrained which means<br>the ability of country governments to<br>extract tax income away from their<br>private-sector economies plays an<br>important role and two the number of<br>fiscal components to be financed by the<br>public purse what I like to call a<br>fiscal varieties perspective which means<br>increasingly country governments have to<br>make some hard choices about which<br>public goods they should prioritize this<br>also plays an important role and one<br>implication of my researchers that it<br>would be of interest now to test these<br>three propositions with respect to other<br>areas of public financing such as<br>military spending health spending<br>welfare spending etc to see if they hold<br>with respect to them to thanks and God<br>bless<br>thank you my I enjoyed that quite casual<br>but very informed style and initially I<br>thought the slide was quite dense but<br>you actually talked us through it quite<br>nicely so it was really good and I<br>appreciated the way you had both the<br>symbols and the mathematical notation to<br>nice confidence you totally owned that<br>subject and I'm glad at the very end you<br>started talking about how you could take<br>what you've learned and start looking at<br>other areas of our world so that was<br>brilliant thank you very much<br>thank you I agree with the others and<br>again also nice to see people mixing up<br>and using different vehicles to engage<br>us and you engage us by thanking us for<br>being here and it's that that way to<br>engage your audience that was very much<br>appreciated and also at the end when you<br>said what you found may be generalizable<br>into other areas so taking knowledge and<br>demonstrating that it might be useful<br>for more than the narrower area that you<br>looked at it was was very very good to<br>have so thank you<br>thank you very much mark I can get<br>behind economics if it's got pies in it<br>even better if it has donuts but pies<br>will do it's all good<br>dinnertime isn't it right next up we<br>have Marshall Lewis Marshall is doing<br>his doctorate in anthropology in<br>archaeology his supervisors are Ruth<br>Fitzgerald and Susan Waddell and his<br>topic is ritual design thinking if you<br>have goals that are important to you and<br>I bet you do those may be your<br>opportunities to design your rituals to<br>serve those aspirations that's the basic<br>idea behind my project think of rituals<br>well I'm gonna do three things quickly<br>I'm gonna talk about what I'm meaning by<br>ritual why you might care about ritual<br>and how we might go about designing<br>ritual think of ritual as actions that<br>embody and express your values and<br>beliefs we live our values and beliefs<br>through ritual so you may have waking<br>ritual hygiene rituals eating shopping<br>working pregame post-sex religious<br>ritual if you are religious even binging<br>on Netflix can be ritual like why are we<br>so ritualistic well ritual scholarship<br>is extensive and contentious I'll focus<br>on two propositions one there are<br>discernable characteristics of ritual<br>some listed here and - and this is why<br>you should care ritual works<br>experimental psychologists are<br>discovering what coaches and drill<br>sergeants have known for millennia<br>ritual has real impact among what it<br>does it aligns and reinforces those<br>beliefs and values of participants and<br>that is real knowledge you can do<br>something with that<br>so what would it look like to design<br>your rituals to support your aspirations<br>well that's what my project is about I'm<br>applying insights from the<br>interdisciplinary study of ritual to do<br>three things first to defend a<br>conception of ritual as strategy to be<br>designed secondly to evolve a<br>methodology a practical method for<br>designing ritual based on the literature<br>and thirdly to apply that method in a<br>real-world context so two quick examples<br>I work with a large Kiwi organization<br>that once a collaborative culture so the<br>question becomes how might we design our<br>organizational rituals like team<br>meetings problem solving sessions to<br>live that collaborative culture in<br>addition my youngest daughter starting<br>law school this month and she's<br>designing rituals to maintain a healthy<br>lifestyle in the midst of that intensity<br>ritual is human strategy it's the way<br>that we bring some sense of method and<br>order to the challenges and chaos of<br>life thank you<br>well done Marshall and again it's a<br>general comity everyone we've had<br>tonight such superb timing getting in on<br>time and that ability to adapt the<br>presentation and get just that key<br>message right at the end was was<br>outstanding also along the way some nice<br>roadmaps that brought us back onto the<br>this is why and what it should look like<br>an example and so well done I think<br>another fantastic example of how to<br>think about getting a lot of what has<br>been occupying your mind for a long time<br>into a form that gets into a met our<br>mind in just three minutes thank you<br>thanks thanks Marshall it's really got<br>me thinking about rituals and some of my<br>rituals and also you know I'm fascinated<br>by the idea that you can actually design<br>rituals and the workplace so certainly a<br>lot to take away from that I like the<br>way you draw on examples and and the<br>slide also evokes some quite interesting<br>ideas so thank you just gonna say<br>perhaps we get a ritual of wearing<br>academic gowns or something like that<br>and and see how that affects how our<br>well being<br>yeah I felt like three minutes wasn't<br>enough for me I wanted to hear more<br>you're talking about sort of turning a<br>few unconscious things conscious and<br>deliberate which is fascinating I've<br>done a lot of Design Thinking study<br>myself and this is brilliant and you did<br>the old ritual for my job is tell them<br>what you're going to say say it tell<br>them what you said which is you can't<br>thank you very much Marshall I'm gonna<br>get me some rituals if it's going to<br>help with some chaos there'll be<br>excellent right next up we have teeth<br>sue Lee Tess is doing a PhD in medicine<br>University of Otago Wellington her<br>supervisors are Sonny Collins Elliot<br>Bell and Gabriel Jenkins the topic is<br>the therapeutic crafting of love journey<br>to the core of the clinical encounter<br>with patients at risk for suicide hi<br>please take a look at this picture and<br>try to identify the emotion that comes<br>to you hold on to it and I'll get back<br>to it<br>I work in clinical suicide ology<br>studying how the therapeutic encounter<br>can be affected by the way clinicians<br>feel like any other patients suicidal<br>people need a strong therapeutic<br>relationship to benefit from therapy yet<br>they can be difficult so that clinicians<br>tend to feel manipulated anxious and<br>therefore can be avoidant or rejecting<br>of suicidal patients which can have<br>lethal consequences on the other hand<br>conditions positive feelings of<br>closeness and affiliation or associated<br>with better outcomes yet maybe because<br>it is uncommon<br>this is rarely studied in regards to<br>suicidal patients so we address this<br>knowledge gap by using a mixed method<br>designed to explore specifically the<br>stance of clinicians who feel positively<br>inclined or like working with suicidal<br>patients first we used a national survey<br>to estimate the prevalence and of the<br>267 clinicians who took the survey in<br>New Zealand just under 15% declared that<br>they liked working with our patient's we<br>invited them to a second study where we<br>used grounded theory to construct an<br>understanding of the positive<br>inclination we conducted 12 interviews<br>in total and at the core of the<br>therapeutic encounter we found<br>clinicians experienced of forming a deep<br>emotional connection with a suicidal<br>patients and this was both what was<br>soothing for patients and deeply<br>satisfying for clinicians themselves<br>first clinicians empathize with a<br>patient's distress when they sit with<br>the shared emotion this creates an<br>interpersonal emotional regulation where<br>patients benefit from clinicians own<br>ability to bear and regulate difficult<br>emotion akin to a mother who uses her<br>capacity to become to calm her baby in<br>time this emotional connection induces<br>an attachment which is ultimately<br>therapeutic suicidality decreases as<br>connectedness grows so back to the<br>picture to use an analogy where most of<br>us would feel annoyed with a stubborn<br>dog or anxious with an aggressive one<br>these conditions instead strive to see<br>this to see past the behavior and feel<br>warm and compassionate by exercising<br>their empathic ability these clinicians<br>whom I call our AHA clinicians have<br>developed the art of crafting laws<br>thanks T is a very powerful slide there<br>and I love the way you started with it<br>to get us thinking about it and came<br>back to it at the end and also this is a<br>great example of how you can actually<br>tear all elements of your research from<br>the background the Christians and how<br>you did it and your findings and three<br>minutes so well done in great body<br>language I kept on finding myself<br>leaning forward and leaning forward and<br>leaning forward which I take as a sign<br>as I'm engaged I want to hear more I<br>want to be a bit closer and I want to<br>hear a little bit more good job with the<br>puppy dog we should ban those next time<br>because that's like the the nuclear<br>weapon of gaining attention great I feel<br>like I've just been to the theater it<br>was just a wonderful performance it was<br>engaging it had that it had that hook at<br>the start that then you wrapped up at<br>the end again in terms of the research<br>again you've got within that the Watts<br>and the and the actual numbers of<br>studies participants how you'd focus<br>down and I think I even got insights of<br>how you might then use those are aha<br>clinicians to help train others and<br>transfer that knowledge further so<br>thank you very much tears and a reminder<br>to the judges please stay in your seats<br>all right don't you fall over Craig that<br>could go dreadfully wrong next up we<br>have our final contestant<br>we have Zoe Zoe ward is doing a PhD in<br>medicine she works from the U campus<br>Christchurch campus of the University of<br>Otago her supervisors in a pill brow the<br>best year in schmeyer Vicky Cameron and<br>associate professor John Pearson her<br>topic is biomarkers for heart failure<br>your heart is amazing it beats around<br>100,000 times a day or a minute if<br>you're in the three minute thesis and<br>its job is to deliver blood and oxygen<br>and nutrients to your body and in order<br>to do that it needs its own blood supply<br>and this is provided by the coronary<br>arteries seen here and we can see the<br>blood flowing along a healthy archery<br>along the top<br>now coronary artery disease is caused by<br>a buildup for these fatty or a thorough<br>static plaques and if the blood flow<br>becomes completely blocks then heart<br>muscle downstream of this may die and<br>this is what we know is a heart attack<br>so some people who have a heart attack<br>will then go on to develop heart failure<br>and this is basically where the heart<br>can no longer meet the demands of the<br>body to pump enough blood we have well<br>established biomarkers for diagnosing<br>both heart attack and heart failure but<br>we need better biomarkers for disease<br>progression from heart attack to heart<br>failure and a biomarker is basically a<br>disease indicator that we can measure in<br>the blood and they take on many forms<br>such as hormones DNA or RNA and I'll be<br>looking at RNA so what is RNA well most<br>of our cells in our body contain DNA and<br>the DNA contains all the instructions or<br>genes to make proteins so the DNA makes<br>many photocopies of the gene into RNA<br>and then this can either go on to make<br>the price<br>in IE it's coding or not it's non-coding<br>and much of the research historically<br>has been done on these protein coding<br>RNAs and people thought the rest of our<br>DNA didn't really do much and they<br>actually called it junk DNA but the<br>really cool thing is we now know that in<br>this junk DNA is where these recently<br>discovered non-coding RNAs are and<br>they're really important they turn other<br>genes on and off and they've been<br>implicated in many diseases so the other<br>really cool thing about my PhD is that<br>it's in a relatively new field called<br>bioinformatics<br>and this is basically where computers<br>meet biology and bioinformatics is<br>allowing us to analyze the huge amounts<br>of data that's in our DNA<br>so with bioinformatics I hope to<br>discover RNA biomarkers that will help<br>us to predict those people who haven't<br>had a heart attack will then go on to<br>develop heart failure so we can target<br>treatment to those people that need it<br>most<br>thank you<br>nice presentation simple progressive<br>move forward in the right order great<br>information on your slide I learned a<br>lot and you're working that area your<br>own work is in that area you know what's<br>in the junk DNA that's sort of going to<br>change our lives 20 years from now so<br>I'm always intrigued to hear about that<br>and beautiful smile you're confident and<br>you're owning this it's a good job thank<br>you you're well done<br>look again that use of humor in what we<br>had tonight we had life and death in<br>Shaymin Streisand and apples on<br>everything and we've all had that with<br>humor I love the hundred thousand times<br>a day that you know judges hearts beat a<br>hundred thousand times a minute as well<br>when we're doing this we're all that<br>little bit nervous but well done thank<br>you thanks thanks so similarly I love<br>the start of their time talking about<br>the statistics around the heart and a<br>bit of humor and about more beats during<br>nervousness again you conveyed very<br>complex ideas really simply and that was<br>beautifully helped by the graphics so<br>terrific graphic and really looking<br>forward to what unfolds during your<br>research journey so hope to hear more in<br>the future<br>Thanks<br>right<br>I think the moment is almost upon us to<br>announce the winners do you want to come<br>down and do that Richard Troy yeah are<br>we going to run this fast oh I am I'm<br>useless I'm just a and I was saying to<br>you I'd like to did you share my joke<br>that you you can actually say that<br>because I am the DVC RNA buddy<br>physicists can't spell either can't<br>spell can't find a certificate<br>you've got my certificates aha<br>see it takes a business owner doesn't it<br>to have the certificates good man<br>all right over to you right and you've<br>got though the key information about the<br>People's Choice Awards I do okay okay<br>well look can't get good help Kenya the<br>one thing I'd like to just start off<br>with is that that was amazing so I'd<br>like everyone just to join me in<br>congratulating all of the contestants<br>again<br>we've seen the wonderful journeys across<br>all of our academic endeavors and the<br>sciences the humanities in business and<br>in health that are so just so relevant<br>to what we do in our daily lives and how<br>we live and how we love and how we learn<br>and how we even die that that have all<br>been presented with such passion such<br>clarity with great visuals and just<br>everyone had their nice touch of liver<br>liberty because whatever we do we just<br>got a we've got a show that we enjoy it<br>so you all did that very very well and<br>I'm also aware that I'm the one standing<br>between us in the staff Club am I so<br>that yeah we we don't we don't we don't<br>want a 20-minute lecture on the the<br>wonderful things over the three minute<br>thesis so that there and end my remarks<br>I think the judges and other judges and<br>I had actually really hard time in both<br>cases taking those top few that we had<br>identified and in determining which ones<br>we could all agree on and the one thing<br>that we determined is that we would try<br>to be least wrong because whatever we do<br>we will have made a wrong decision<br>because there's some of the attributes<br>of those that won't get awarded a prize<br>tonight there were actually bitter than<br>the sum of the then the similar<br>attributes and all of the other<br>presentation so I'm happy to talk<br>informally maybe as the other judges are<br>about identifying what those outstanding<br>attributes from any of you were and also<br>surprisingly we then have a contest of<br>between us and you as the people about<br>who was least strong because we've got<br>different winners from the People's<br>Choice in the judges in each of the<br>categories anyway without further ado<br>then we shall award the master's thesis<br>three minute final a prize - yes memory<br>who had to go who had to go so our able<br>assistants will make sure that she<br>receives her certificate actually sorry<br>do we have from hello world haha sorry<br>sorry sorry I'm sorry thank you very<br>much true ah yes I knew someone would<br>screw up on the stage and it was none of<br>it was not a very thanks masters<br>People's Choice in with Headmaster's<br>three minute thesis awardee the Masters<br>Peace People's Choice Award goes to<br>Christopher Keller<br>we're now gonna reverse order for the<br>PhD with the People's Choice Award PhD<br>People's Choice Award is to email ions<br>in the winner for the best PhD with a<br>voucher of seven hundred and fifty<br>dollars and towards one economy class<br>returned fair to Brisbane to present in<br>the Australia in an Australasian final<br>as test suea<br>and intestine the offer to say anything<br>in response owed and look before clear<br>does the final rate I just like to think<br>clear very much for coming in this year<br>again clear has taken on this job when<br>she was working in the graduate research<br>school but she was so good at it that we<br>scour the scale of us the university<br>would scale the planet to find clear<br>wherever she may be and insist that she<br>comes back so thank you very much for<br>that service clear thank you Richard<br>oh thank you very much it's really<br>lovely it's always an honor to be asked<br>to do this I think they've tried to ask<br>me not to do it but I insist that I'm<br>going to do it forever<br>so thank you very much it takes a lot to<br>coordinate three minute thesis<br>competition I know from years gone past<br>when I did it and I know that there are<br>always a number of people to thank I'd<br>like to thank the teams both in<br>marketing communications teams at GRS<br>teams across the divisions and<br>departments for their hard work in<br>organizing all the heats and supporting<br>their students through this process<br>particular thanks go to Andrew Loney<br>and and Stansfield over there thank you<br>to to the judges the heats wherever you<br>may be wherever you were and wherever<br>you will be tomorrow and also to all<br>those who participated in the heats<br>there is an amazing pool of talent at<br>the University of Otago a big thank you<br>is also owed to our sponsor drew Carmody<br>managing director of hello world Dunedin<br>I'd like to thank the audience for<br>coming along and supporting your<br>students your friends and your<br>colleagues and I would like to thank the<br>judges very much I would like to thank<br>all the judges bar one very much for<br>their insightful adjudication finally I<br>would like to thank and congratulate all<br>you finalists getting to the final of<br>the three-minute thesis is no small feat<br>it is a significant thing that you have<br>done and it will hold you in good stead<br>for the rest of your degrees so well<br>done congratulations and please once<br>more give them all a big round</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
