Masters runner up Su Mukund presents her thesis, ‘Factors that influence science and non-science option choices in Year 13 at NZ secondary schools: Student voices’. Su is from the Faculty of Education and Social Work (School of Learning, Development and Professional Practice).<br><br>Three Minute Thesis is a fast-paced research communication competition established by The University of Queensland. It challenges students to communicate their research in an engaging way to a general audience. The catch? They have just 3 minutes and a single, static presentation slide to work with.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi I'm a science teacher I teach in a<br>low decile Secondary School in South<br>Auckland over the last six years the<br>numbers of enrollments and physics<br>chemistry and biology has been dropping<br>and of course this the senior management<br>want to know why we teachers want to<br>know why in this particular process I<br>have wondered in a world filled with<br>science technology as well as STEM jobs<br>why why are students not taking science<br>literature as well as international<br>reports convinced me that the problem is<br>not just in my school this problem is<br>nationwide in New Zealand and it is<br>evident in many other countries across<br>the world<br>and so my research aims to find out why<br>or what factors influence this decision<br>making among high school students but I<br>want to hear it from the stakeholders in<br>our education system student voices in<br>my pursuit of my research I have<br>approached another low decile school in<br>Auckland and I have surveyed over a<br>hundred and forty students using a<br>questionnaire the questions basically<br>asked the students their interests their<br>reasons both personal as well as<br>external reasons as to why they were not<br>taking science or why they were taking<br>sites the responses from these<br>questionnaires formed the foundation of<br>understanding how this decision-making<br>was being influenced amongst our<br>adolescents to add more flesh to the<br>bones I carried out a large number of<br>semi-structured interviews with a number<br>of students both science<br>as well as non science and at the moment<br>I'm using their narratives and the data<br>to write my thesis so what do these<br>voices say a number of these voices say<br>science is okay but not for me when I<br>did my science in years 9 and 10 I loved<br>it<br>but the credits of NCEA and assessments<br>shut the door on my face a number of<br>others said oh the curriculum is boring<br>it doesn't appeal to me and so here I am<br>a teacher I want everybody to hear these<br>voices especially our policymakers</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
