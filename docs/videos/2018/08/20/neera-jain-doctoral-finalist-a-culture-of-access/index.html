Doctoral finalist Neera Jain presents her thesis, ‘A culture of access? The medical school social environment for students with disabilities’. Neera is from the Faculty of Education and Social Work (School of Curriculum and Pedagogy).<br><br>Three Minute Thesis is a fast-paced research communication competition established by The University of Queensland. It challenges students to communicate their research in an engaging way to a general audience. The catch? They have just 3 minutes and a single, static presentation slide to work with.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>just for a moment I want you to close<br>your eyes and imagine a doctor now<br>imagine a disabled person what words or<br>images just came to your mind often<br>times these two concepts come together<br>in a specific equation the doctor works<br>to fix a disabled person who's broken or<br>unable in some way but what if the<br>doctor is disabled how do these ideas<br>about doctors and disability affect<br>those living at the intersection this<br>question is at the heart of my research<br>you see in 2016 over 1500 US medical<br>students disclosed a disability to their<br>school and these schools are legally<br>required to provide them with equal<br>access but beyond the legal mandate it's<br>in schools best interest that these<br>students go on and serve patients in<br>their communities having more disabled<br>doctors could help improve medical care<br>for disabled patients and working<br>alongside disabled doctors could help to<br>shift ideas about disability among their<br>peers<br>my thesis seeks to unlock this potential<br>of disability in medical education I'm<br>examining the social environment of for<br>us medical schools and I've interviewed<br>46 disabled medical students their<br>teachers and school administrators what<br>I want to understand is how these<br>students navigate medical school and how<br>schools enact a culture of access to<br>include them what I'm finding is that<br>these stereotypes about doctors and<br>disability they're deeply deeply<br>ingrained disability is still a<br>liability in medicine to make real<br>change schools must actively defy these<br>stereotypes and recognize disability as<br>a valued identity I do see cracks<br>forming and fixed ideas about how<br>training should work and this opens new<br>possibilities to learn and be a doctor<br>in different ways but these efforts<br>still happen just one student at a time<br>with fewer efforts happening on an<br>institutional level my hope is that<br>through the ideas developing out of my<br>research we can break these cracks wide<br>open so that the next time we think of a<br>doctor we just might think of a disabled<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
