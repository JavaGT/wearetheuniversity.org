People’s Choice Award winner Nurul Haiza “Zaza” Sapiee presents her thesis, ‘Bridging the Gap: Structural Integration in the Spine’. Zaza is from the Faculty of Engineering (Department of Chemicals and Materials Engineering).<br><br>Three Minute Thesis is a fast-paced research communication competition established by The University of Queensland. It challenges students to communicate their research in an engaging way to a general audience. The catch? They have just 3 minutes and a single, static presentation slide to work with.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>it was just another normal night but<br>actually it wasn't my best friend she<br>was lying in bed next to me crying<br>Zod's on my back hurts so bad she said<br>we're frantic we didn't know what to do<br>so then we thought let's bring her to<br>the hospital after hours and hours of<br>waiting the doctor came and brought us<br>the bad news<br>your friend has slipped us he said and<br>unfortunately there's nothing we can do<br>about it except give her pain medication<br>I was in my second year of Engineering<br>at that time and I couldn't help but<br>feel completely helpless it wasn't until<br>the final year of my bachelor's degree<br>when a lecturer came and approached me<br>and asked would you like to do a PhD in<br>biomechanics of the spine so then I<br>thought well maybe this is how I can<br>help so you must be thinking how does<br>engineering relate to the spine yes well<br>the thing about materials is that<br>everything around us is made of a<br>specific structure<br>it's especially parts of our body and<br>sometimes going to the fundamental<br>basics gives us a better understanding<br>at the bigger picture so let's talk<br>about the spine now the spine consists<br>of a very compliant disk sandwich in<br>between rigid bones imagine the<br>difference between these two materials<br>so the junction connecting them plays an<br>important role in the strength of the<br>spine as a whole so the idea was is to<br>take a tiny piece from you this and pull<br>it apart and analyze the regions of<br>failure at various levels interestingly<br>enough at nano scales we were able to<br>see fibers of the bits extend and<br>intertwine into the fibers of the bone<br>sort of like roots of a tree in fact the<br>structures were actually pretty similar<br>to steel reinforced concrete now in<br>steel reinforced concrete the steel<br>elements are simply brought in to a<br>close in some England association it is<br>then the concrete matrix which provides<br>that all-important integrative medium in<br>the case of the spine parallels the role<br>of mineralization so actually the<br>strength of this Junction is derived<br>from the combination of these<br>materials so the significance of this<br>study is that it shines a new light on a<br>region once considered as separate<br>entities hence giving us a better<br>understanding of the relation between<br>structural integration and how it fails<br>and potentially we hope to bridge the<br>gap between spine surgeons and engineers<br>all around the world thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
