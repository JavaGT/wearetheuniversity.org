Doctoral finalist Priscila Salloum presents her thesis, ‘Genetic and phenotypic variation in Onithochiton neglectus around New Zealand’. Priscila is from the Faculty of Science (School of Biological Sciences).<br><br>Three Minute Thesis is a fast-paced research communication competition established by The University of Queensland. It challenges students to communicate their research in an engaging way to a general audience. The catch? They have just 3 minutes and a single, static presentation slide to work with.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening when I was at school in<br>Brazil I was never one of those very<br>popular students that everyone knows<br>about and who attract people during<br>break time but I graduated and kept<br>studying until I started my PhD and then<br>I was faced with a challenge to choose a<br>marine animal to study whales turtles<br>fish mussels<br>none of those popular ones I ended up<br>choosing something that is more or less<br>anonymous like ours a jerk items for<br>those of you thinking that these are<br>limpets I tell you they are not they<br>kind of look similar but Titans have<br>eight small shells that overlap<br>allowing them to roll up as an armadillo<br>an excellent defense for something that<br>spends the whole life attach it to a<br>rock I know so many exciting animals to<br>work with and so many endangered ones<br>why Triton's well have you ever<br>discovered something really amazing that<br>happened to me my very first result<br>suggests that New Zealand has two groups<br>of titans and they happen to live at<br>different places when lives at the North<br>Island and the other lives at the South<br>Island and the sub-antarctic Islands all<br>together I wonder if this has something<br>to do with traveling did you know that<br>North Island kaito zoo no travel for the<br>southern Titans of very brave adventures<br>they attached to the base of giant<br>seaweed and travel very very far<br>migrating between New Zealand South<br>Island and the sub-antarctic Islands at<br>this point you may already know why I<br>wasn't a popular student right such a<br>weird choice but these Titans are<br>finally doing something about it<br>they are giving a very cool perspective<br>to my work I should I say hot nevermind<br>I'm talking climate change that is such<br>a popular topic so using very recent<br>molecular technologies and that cup of<br>not so recent as well I want to<br>check how much temperature matters for<br>titans hours good northern Titans why<br>they do not live home is that because<br>the South Island is colder and why a<br>certain kite ins do not come up to the<br>north is that because there's no<br>transport available or because it's too<br>warm for their taste and I hope that<br>their answers will help me with<br>popularity I mean will help us<br>understand more about how temperature<br>influences both in popular and popular<br>animals and also the potential to adapt<br>to changing climate conditions thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
