Masters winner Georgia Watson presents her thesis, ‘UnPACking Migraine: Understanding Ligand-Receptor Interactions Involved in Migraine’. Georgia is from the Faculty of Science (School of Biological Sciences) and will represent the University at the 2018 Masters Inter-University Challenge.<br><br>Three Minute Thesis is a fast-paced research communication competition established by The University of Queensland. It challenges students to communicate their research in an engaging way to a general audience. The catch? They have just 3 minutes and a single, static presentation slide to work with.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>if I was to ask you what is the leading<br>cause of neurological disability<br>worldwide what would your answer be<br>stroke dementia well what if I was to<br>tell you that the correct answer is<br>migraine because it is migraine is a<br>third most prevalent disease on the<br>planet affecting over 1 billion people<br>including me and including many of you<br>here in the audience tonight and as all<br>of us who have ever felt or looked<br>something like this will agree it's much<br>more than just a headache migraine<br>attacks cause severe pain gastric<br>disturbances like sensitivity and<br>information and in chronic cases<br>migraine attacks can occur over 15 times<br>per month leading to a significant level<br>of disability unfortunately we aren't<br>able to cure migraine but drugs still<br>exists to manage their symptoms when a<br>migraine attack occurs however these<br>drugs don't necessarily work in every<br>patient and even if they do they come<br>with a wide range of side effects some<br>of which may be just as the ability to<br>miss a migraine itself as such new drugs<br>need to be developed the goal of my<br>research is to pave the way for new<br>migraine therapeutics we know the<br>protein in the brain called pituitary<br>didn't cyclase activating peptide which<br>makes my head hurt to say so I'll just<br>call it pack app pack app binds to the<br>pack one receptor in the brain leading<br>to the onset of a migraine thus it is<br>thought that if we can stop this<br>interaction from occurring via a drug<br>this may prove to be a new way of<br>treating migraine as this interaction<br>isn't fully understood I aim to incur<br>the way in which packet binds to the<br>pack one receptor<br>sir-sir aid future drug development<br>efforts the binding between packet and<br>pack one is like fitting two puzzle<br>pieces together when they bind the pack<br>one receptor is activated and sends a<br>signal leading to the onset of a<br>migraine now I can take part of the pack<br>one receptor and mutate it and affect<br>had the receptor is important for<br>binding mutating it will effectively<br>change the shape of that puzzle piece<br>meaning pair cap can't bind as well<br>this results in a change in the signal<br>that the PEC one receptor producers<br>which I can measure alternatively if<br>that pub the receptor is an important<br>for binding mutating it won't have any<br>effect on the way in which packet impact<br>one bind if I'm you take different sites<br>on the receptor one by one I can see if<br>the signal produced by the PEC one<br>receptor changes and this allows me to<br>build a picture of the exact way in<br>which packet and PEC one bind with my<br>research<br>future studies can create a drug which<br>binds to the PEC one receptor in the<br>same way as packet but instead of<br>activating it blocks it telling that<br>migraine to PEC it's Bex thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
