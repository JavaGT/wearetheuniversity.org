Yet chemicals that deliver great benefits today too often come with deadly downsides for tomorrow. Unlike in ages past, as chemical contamination makes societies progressively unliveable, we have nowhere to escape to. It follows that the pioneering stage of building new societies to escape unacceptable conditions has to shift from the historical pattern of moving somewhere else to set up something new and free from the objectionable encumbrances of the old, to recreating our world from within. Looking from afar, I am proud to see the University of Auckland in the beautiful land of my birth, “Freedom’s ramparts on the sea”, embracing green science to move the chemicals sector from current practices to alternatives that prioritize the welfare of the future. I will describe the systematic approach my team and its many magnificent collaborators are building to tackle these problems head-on and to develop sustainability solutions through chemistry-centred, multidisciplinary education, research and development.  Our biggest challenges are cultural more than technical and present perhaps the greatest opportunity humanity has ever had to reinvent itself as a more realistic and competent steward of the ecosphere. When people commit themselves to learning how to love the future, they embrace inspirational and transformative powers offering the comforts of personal centeredness and competence that are critical building blocks of global peace and harmony.<br><br>Terry Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry and Director, Institute for Green Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh PA: Learning how to love the future through green science<br><br>Professor Terrence J Collins is also an Honorary Professor and Distinguished Alumnus of the University of Auckland. Professor Collins earned his doctorate from the University of Auckland and then conducted postdoctoral studies at Stanford University.  He taught first at Caltech and joined the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University in 1987. He started teaching green chemistry in 1992, creating the first course of this type anywhere. His pioneering research, which has helped to develop the interface between chemistry and sustainability, began before green chemistry was a recognized discipline. His achievements have been acknowledged by many awards including: the US Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award (1999), the Pittsburgh Award of the American Chemical Society (2004), Award of the New York Metropolitan Catalysis Society (2007), Charles E. Kaufman Award of the Pittsburgh Foundation (2008), Heinz Award for the Environment (2010) and Fellowship of the American Chemical Society (2013). Recognized internationally for his research on TAML activators, his green chemistry education, and public speaking on the chemical dimension of sustainability, Professor Collins continues to champion the sustainability cause.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we should get started so I'd

professor Collins<br>continues to champion the sustainability<br>core<br>and I now invite you Terry to coming<br>presidential election oh well well thank<br>you very much James it's a great<br>pleasure that always to come back to New<br>Zealand and to be here in this beautiful<br>city I think my hearts and America my<br>soul might be here learning to love the<br>future of your green science so what I'm<br>going to do is I'm going to begin<br>talking very broadly then I'm going to<br>come and discuss how we approach<br>developing chemistry for sustainability<br>at Carnegie Mellon and then we're going<br>you<br>not able the evidence is crystal clear<br>to handle that power well we think in<br>the short term we think about our<br>families educating feeding them the<br>grandkids etc we'll see that we don't<br>think about human beings five<br>generations ten generations out and we<br>didn't have to in the past because we<br>didn't have the powers that we have now<br>with the powers we have we have the<br>power to completely mess everything up<br>and apparently at least from my reading<br>that is what is happening now so the<br>need to bring sustainability into<br>universities which after all trained the<br>leaders of the civilization is probably<br>the most critical single intellectual<br>need that we have in the modern<br>university it brings transgenerational<br>justice to the to the center of our<br>civilizations ethical stage if we don't<br>address that there is no good future<br>and so really this is our first<br>granddaughter and on the day that she<br>she was one it really is thinking about<br>the present end and the future and if<br>you think when you get one of these<br>they're you know mum and dad are really<br>happy granddad and Grandma are really<br>happy and this baby will perhaps go on<br>and have its own generation and if your<br>grand dad and grandma Rose we are we are<br>now we might see that baby and then<br>something happens this comes along and<br>so actually I think there will be very<br>different if we lived instead of four<br>but less than a hundred years four three<br>four five hundred years because it's on<br>the order of a hundred years the scale<br>on which things the disasters playing<br>out in slo-mo that's the problem that we<br>we are not if it was impacting us<br>personally and we could see it we might<br>be a little bit different but an actual<br>fact as we know this is really what we<br>want to think about we need to be<br>thinking as never before we never had<br>the need to before about what happens to<br>our species and to everything else<br>moving forward and I<br>chemistry is actually central to that<br>and to intellectual construct it's<br>really about developing an intimacy for<br>the future in the present really deepen<br>the core of each human being something<br>so it's elbow shows this picture and has<br>what I I consider great great movies<br>this is Apollo 8 the first manned<br>mission to the moon synth affect your<br>back December 24 1968<br>we saw that picture I think we didn't<br>have color television but we saw the<br>picture here's a what the pilot said are<br>the vast loneliness is Oren spying and<br>it makes you realize just what you have<br>back there on earth and so here's the<br>earth front taken a picture from under<br>there the rings of Saturn by the Cassini<br>spacecraft that that's when a half<br>billion kilometres from Earth this tiny<br>little dot out there this is our garden<br>of vino it's the precious singularity<br>the palace of all known life our only<br>visible home our greatest joy our<br>everything and securing it's good future<br>as the greatest test we've ever had of<br>our intelligence and character as a<br>species so you know probably all know<br>it's got to be quite famous but I<br>remember once I I came back to New<br>Zealand and we went up north to it to a<br>beach with friends and that they had<br>there was dust I I'm very allergic to<br>dust so I couldn't sleep so I went out<br>for a walk at like 3:00 in the morning<br>and I I was there was no light but I was<br>able to walk in the bicha I looked up<br>and there it was the Starlight was<br>extraordinary<br>that's our galaxy alone and as far as we<br>know there's nothing there other than us<br>in terms of life we are a singularity as<br>far as we know and here's our friends<br>next door this is my what<br>aghh or what makes very clear is that<br>everything that's precious actually<br>isn't the earth it's in this very thin<br>skin about ten miles from the bottom of<br>the ocean to the top of Everest<br>and here we are chemical technologies<br>present really three a truly as<br>chemistry at the technological core of<br>all the major threats to to civilization<br>there is chemistry and there are three<br>existential threats to this chiffon turn<br>eager spherical scan of life first of<br>all this climate change and you may say<br>we have leaders in America who who don't<br>think it's happening<br>the evidence is completely overwhelming<br>it's happening exactly now we actually<br>have Islands and in the off New Orleans<br>that are going underwater rapidly the<br>people are all happening to move we're<br>losing as you know the beautiful islands<br>atolls of the Pacific and presumably<br>some of the melt not some of the care<br>about party people and the and the<br>tubular ones are coming here because of<br>her nuclear missile venture or mishap<br>has a really big threat it's almost<br>fortunate we had Fukushima it's horrible<br>to say but now the argument that we<br>won't have one of these accidents in a<br>in a jurisdiction where we're not<br>supposed to have one is crystal clear<br>that is still absolutely out of control<br>absolutely out of control and finally we<br>have the thing that my group is most<br>interested in the low-dose toxicity of<br>every day everywhere chemicals and we'll<br>talk a lot about that New Zealand can<br>really contribute powerfully to the<br>future god by deepening national<br>competence and dealing with these<br>threats and you could make of yourself<br>an example to the world you are uniquely<br>blessed you're you're isolated you have<br>a fantastic climate there aren't too<br>many people that may the more you get<br>the more difficult it gets to organize<br>things and actually the things that you<br>have to do are really<br>logically fairly straightforward and so<br>if New Zealand decided to make of itself<br>an icon of sustainable for example<br>Solarize your your energy base as<br>quickly as possible of course people<br>have cost to match now but actually once<br>you got it the energy is free from then<br>on our generation are two out you're<br>hugely advantaged if you do this in my<br>opinion anyway so we'll be focusing on<br>the low-dose toxicity now this is a<br>chemical I know there's some chemists<br>are not in the room but for the chemist<br>this is bisphenol A we make about 18<br>billion pounds a year and it's literally<br>in everything and it's an estrogen so we<br>will come back to that later we reviewed<br>that in fact we conducted a study that<br>included the University of Auckland some<br>of the James and nourish Angola here in<br>the audience and their students did part<br>of this work there's a 30 page paper<br>where we review everywhere where you can<br>find BPA as far as I can tell there<br>isn't anywhere where you can't you can<br>find BPA in translucent transparent<br>shrimp under in the Marianas Trench it's<br>everywhere it's an estrogen in animal<br>studies we've extensively validated<br>associations with breast and prostate<br>cancer I'll come back to that so how<br>does the chemist<br>begin to interact with the world to try<br>to figure out toxicity particularly this<br>incredibly threatening low-dose toxicity<br>there I'll go on and on about and I in a<br>very fortunate position I get to move<br>around the world a lot and meet people<br>and make friends with the kind of people<br>who are doing the right kind of research<br>to answer the right kinds of questions<br>and so we had a conference I<br>significantly chose the speakers at this<br>incredibly beautiful Phipps conservatory<br>it's run by a genius Richard Benson Tina<br>you'll see him shortly and if you would<br>know how to do a green building come to<br>Burt's burg and talked<br>- Richard this this thing is<br>unbelievably green everything about it<br>so this was the let's pick my coined the<br>term indirect and disruption amazing<br>hello that Shauna Swan who reviewed the<br>literature and showed we have a Tyrone<br>roll tide many would faraday to mr.<br>so if you want to see this it's online<br>you can go and look there are five short<br>videos and then everybody's talkative so<br>now to the psychology part at least<br>listen my version of it if you what I've<br>come to realize is that human beings<br>when they build constructs particularly<br>pyramidal constructs as such as an<br>academic discipline or a university<br>really primarily focus on interacting<br>with each other to gain approval to gain<br>support to get funding to do their stuff<br>it's very very much a human dynamic it's<br>like a fluffy cloud though it's moving<br>it's changing shape all the time all<br>very anthropocentric and it has beneath<br>it the firmament of reality which is the<br>ecosphere towards which this fluffy<br>cloud is deeply unrealistic and brutally<br>dismissive our future is a species<br>really depends on how we adapt the<br>fluffy cloud our political social and<br>interactive nurse to the demands of the<br>firmament of reality in the fluffy cloud<br>there are some principles it's a dollar<br>fist and all things business problem<br>with the dollar bill is that its<br>immediate value not it doesn't add up it<br>doesn't compensate for negative value in<br>the future of many of our technologies<br>very present oriented it's clever but<br>it's unwise it's isolating and<br>specializations it's deeply tribal and<br>with this<br>- when we develop a chemical technology<br>as there are two critical things does<br>the technology perform well and does it<br>have good cost performance and so if you<br>have something like a fast car it's<br>better than a slow car most people think<br>saying with chemistry I could a<br>wonderful reaction or a powerful drug<br>that can make money off it goes to the<br>marketplace however every chemical also<br>has a health performance and you are<br>carrying about more than a thousand<br>chemicals probably that were not in the<br>urine of your grandparents and some of<br>these chemicals are bioactive in animals<br>that the concentrations found in your<br>aunt and your Yoram bioactive negatively<br>there's an environmental performance so<br>for example the reproductive pill ten<br>millionths of a gram in each pill of the<br>act of estrogen ethanol estradiol you<br>start feminizing male fish of certain<br>species at sub parts per trillion<br>European rivers are running four to six<br>parts per turning they've got a big<br>problem<br>we've lost many we've lost species of<br>fish quite literally from the rivers of<br>Pennsylvania because of its trainers<br>ation there are multiple things but<br>ethinyl estradiol is a really powerful<br>contributor and funny there's a fairness<br>performance that essentially takes on<br>all sorts of various forms depending on<br>how you think about I have time to<br>reflect on that too much but if we<br>really succeed the value proposition for<br>sustainable Penant chemical technology<br>can look like this it'll help yeah you<br>have to you have to make money you have<br>to work well but you're not gonna hurt<br>house you are gonna be fear and you're<br>not gonna hurt the environment so that's<br>a challenge can we do this can we figure<br>this out and so back to the gossamer<br>thin skin of the of the planet this is<br>the ecosphere there's ten miles or so<br>maybe 15 maybe 20 depends on what you<br>wanna count<br>and there are really two places where we<br>human beings assault that mercilessly<br>one is with the energy now we bring in<br>to the economy every single year about<br>10 Giga tons of carbon most of which is<br>burned to run the energy system we're<br>doing absolutely nothing else on that<br>scale<br>nothing we don't make a Giga tons of pop<br>of polymers so that if we were able to<br>pull the switch here and stop the carbon<br>flow in and the resulting 40 gigatons of<br>co2 going out the will would be totally<br>different with respect to sustainability<br>we have to deal with the energy problem<br>and so the other is toxics and the<br>frightening part of it is low dose toxic<br>so the eco economy is actually a<br>subsystem of the ecosphere I mean how<br>can you have a grocery store without<br>animals eggs and meat at it or and on<br>X happened here I might have to go<br>something's going wrong with Maya okay<br>so every day tens of millions of tons of<br>staff comes in from the ecosphere to<br>feed the economy what then happens when<br>it gets in there is chemists take a<br>sizeable hunk of it and turn it into<br>other stuff these are the drugs the<br>polymers all the things that and it<br>cycles around in the economy and<br>eventually the used economically spent<br>matter gets injected back to the<br>ecosphere so your sustainability issues<br>have to do with the incoming stuff in<br>the middle and the outgoing so the<br>chemical enterprise okay so chemists<br>work over here on extraction processes<br>primarily we've got some of the solar<br>going on really critical we need much<br>more as I pointed out here we make all<br>the stuff that that you that run the<br>civilization and here we sort of manage<br>the waste but we don't really this is<br>the least this is one of the most<br>serious problems the red arrow and it's<br>the least focused on by chemists because<br>well you can't really make money from<br>you know waste material and water and<br>stuff like that so the Institute for<br>green science focuses right here at the<br>exit point from the economy to the<br>ecosphere of matter my Institute and you<br>ask yourself how can you parameterize<br>these health environmental and fairness<br>performances we're very lucky the<br>catalyst I'll tell you about how<br>spectacular Causton and technical<br>performance so we don't have to worry<br>about that the normal thing people are<br>worrying about we approach<br>parameterizing health environmental<br>filaments and forms by just as I said<br>finding the right people to work with<br>and getting together and asking the<br>questions how do we do this how do we<br>how do we tackle building these<br>performances<br>to new technologies and the group that<br>I've had the privilege to work with is<br>really extraordinary and I kind of view<br>it as like a cotton International<br>College for a virtual college really for<br>sustainability we spend a lot of time on<br>the internet we talk talk I'm almost<br>ailing with some of these guys all right<br>so now we'll come and talk about VAR<br>catalyst what we actually do so starting<br>in 1980 I had the idea that if you could<br>only disinfect water with with hydrogen<br>peroxide rather than chlorine you'd get<br>rid of all the chlorinated disinfection<br>byproducts some of which are associated<br>quite strongly with certain cancers and<br>human beings but hydrogen peroxide has<br>the thermodynamic power to break down to<br>kill bugs but not the but not the<br>kinetics not it's not fast enough you<br>need a catalyst to speed it up and so<br>the catalyst that we would talk about<br>will come back and even look at this<br>thing again there's 9 atom in the center<br>there's 4 nitrogen surrounding it and<br>these gray rings are organic matter that<br>are the critical part we fiddled the<br>gray rings there's a water molecule<br>sitting on the bottom and the way you<br>with the way that chemists design<br>protocols started in 1980 and running<br>very strong to this day is the following<br>you begin on 1980 imagining what you<br>think the gray blue thing should look<br>like and you make it and then you test<br>it and the problem is you're going to<br>make when you when you put peroxide with<br>this catalyst you're gonna make<br>something that's really reactive it's<br>gotta go and kill bugs action burn<br>molecules it turns out we found out<br>later in the water but but it's gonna be<br>really reactive so what it does is it<br>kills itself it either commits suicide<br>or or homicide depending on whether it's<br>attacking itself or another molecule and<br>that's bad because you want it to live<br>long enough to do to do work so what we<br>did that was unusual as we when<br>something didn't work we didn't abandon<br>it we went and found out how it was<br>decaying and that you just think of like<br>chain<br>we find the weakest point in the chain<br>and then we use our chemical intuition<br>to make that weak point stronger and<br>make us an iterated catalyst and around<br>systematically over time the catalyst<br>get better and better and so actually<br>you through the years you'll see going<br>down there you spin around our 15-year<br>period we ended up with what are called<br>Hamel activators so these are molecules<br>that are less than 1% the size of the<br>enzymes that do this highly efficient<br>chemistry wood or oxide but they are put<br>on the enzymes first time anybody's<br>actually got anything with an pooi of<br>the enzyme activity but actually<br>outperforming them and we were very<br>early on and then we discovered that<br>there was a fundamental weakness in our<br>original design about three or four<br>years ago and we continue to develop and<br>now we have fortunately because we've<br>got brand new patents spectacular even<br>more even better atoms so this brings us<br>to how do you think about a problem like<br>this and I'm focusing on the logic<br>rather than details because I know a lot<br>of people here aren't chemists and so<br>I'd see five intersecting loops like<br>cogs in the design of the sustainable<br>products that we're after the first is<br>inside this green box and it's called<br>the design mode so you want to make a<br>small molecule oxidation catalyst<br>candidate we started there in 1980 the<br>current base catalyst after after all<br>those years as there's more than 30 or<br>40 catalyst actually into the design you<br>test the technical performance once you<br>today's the best cameras we've got right<br>now is achieved in 2017 this thing is<br>already competitive with hydrogen<br>peroxide with ozone which is what Europe<br>is considering to remove micro<br>pollutants from it's minimal wastewater<br>but we think that will I'm sure it's<br>going to get better maybe ten times<br>maybe as much as thousand times better<br>and when you do that you have a big<br>impact on on the cost of the<br>technologies if you find it requires<br>improvement and we're always trying to<br>improvement anyway but sometimes you<br>find you have to improve it you redesign<br>the catalyst you come back here and<br>that's the design look we just keep<br>going around it so that's the iterative<br>design right now let's suppose you<br>eventually get to the point where you've<br>got a catalyst that you really like<br>so today the new tamil catalysts are<br>ready for large-scale commercial<br>development we have commercially<br>developed one of the older catalysts<br>reasonably significantly but unlike<br>ozone chlorine or UDP oxide that people<br>use these are not one reagent you can<br>change the catalyst and when you do you<br>change the activity so the remarkable<br>feature of the rear design loop is that<br>we can continue to build immense savings<br>and sustainability and to do now booked<br>a more based water treatment by<br>iteratively designing for higher<br>technical economic performances to<br>attain superior drop and replacements<br>and we've never had this possibility<br>before at water treatment<br>now if it's acceptable if you get to<br>something then you ask the question is<br>it safe ten years ago nobody knew how to<br>tell if any chemical was safe from these<br>low dose adverse effects so this team of<br>people I've talked about and you'll see<br>them soon got together and said well how<br>do we how do we make it safe and would<br>be like me saying I don't take too much<br>credit because it was everybody was a<br>big part of it that I've built<br>well you're mr. estrogen you and you<br>understand the estrogen pattern hormone<br>system and your mr. androgen and your<br>missus thyroid and your mr. pituitary<br>and your mr. such-and-such what do we<br>have to pass with any chemical to make<br>you happy that we don't have an estrogen<br>and androgen a thyroid like hormone etc<br>and we spent five years on that problem<br>phone calls weekly then even more often<br>several retreats and eventually<br>published a paper doing it so we now<br>know how to tell to the highest levels<br>at least of contemporary science whether<br>or not you have a safe or unsafe<br>catalyst if it's not acceptable for<br>safety you go back to the design board<br>so we now come to a major civilizational<br>problem the problem of how we test for<br>the safety of a chemical and actually<br>the basic underlying principles 400<br>years old trait spectacle Paracelsus and<br>captured and proceeded and the statement<br>the dose makes the poison<br>so we started high dose and we BRE lower<br>the dose until we reach the food<br>studying animals and out see an ld50 50%<br>of the animals are died within this<br>period of time and then we keep going<br>down until we reach a low L a lowest<br>observed adverse effect level and then<br>we keep going down to you get a no L no<br>observed adverse effect level and then<br>the regular basis come in and say well<br>we want to be safer than that so they<br>said a daily exposure one to two orders<br>of magnitude lower the problem is the<br>intricate system works at infinitesimal<br>concentrations and it's not accounted<br>for in this so we really should tune the<br>testing protocol upside down this would<br>create when we talk about it a firestorm<br>with industry but it needs to be done<br>because of how the end of the hormone<br>system functions with Hillman working at<br>parts per trillion to low parts per<br>billion levels the historical dose makes<br>the poison is wrong the lower lowers<br>deserved adverse effect level obtained<br>when you come from low to high is going<br>to be different from when you come from<br>what from high to low because you go<br>through this window what if you started<br>an incredibly low dose and bring it up<br>you go through the window of activity of<br>the in Drakon system that you don't even<br>test for when you're when you're coming<br>up here and you might think well surely<br>if I've gotta love it blood up here the<br>in dragon system will recognize that but<br>no it doesn't because cells have defense<br>mechanisms and when there's enough<br>material too much material they say hey<br>don't like this guy and they turn on<br>their defense mechanisms so this is a<br>huge change that we have to make we need<br>to turn it upside down if it's<br>acceptable you then go and you start you<br>say okay maybe I have is I have a safe<br>commercial catalyst candidate so you<br>begin optimizing the commercial<br>synthesis and we work with toll<br>manufacturers to do that if the cost is<br>unstable well back you go start again<br>and then you break out of that we've<br>done once and we show to break out now<br>with a new catalyst and you go to Bob<br>catalyst production and then you start<br>engaging with regulatory agencies and<br>the markets that you want to and you run<br>pilot trials and you do demonstration<br>plants so that's the real-world testing<br>and then once you've done that if it's<br>our catalysts you you we we think we<br>have a major thing possible possibility<br>admissible waste water you you think<br>about industrial wastewater as well<br>crude oil and gas production we have<br>fabulous results there agricultural<br>waste water so that you can get the<br>estrogens and the and the antibiotics<br>out of animal urine and feces if you if<br>you have a concentrated animal operation<br>as we have many of in America and<br>landfill leachate it's astonishing<br>landfill leachate so estrogenic nothing<br>can live in it because of BPA we'll tell<br>you about the shortly nothing can live a<br>landfill leachate it's the breakdown of<br>poly carbonate cat plastic leaking BPA<br>and where BPA is thought is about mm 1<br>mm the the strength of activity of<br>estrogen our estradiol the natural<br>female estrogen so it's quite a weak<br>estrogen but if you raise the<br>concentration to parts per million parts<br>per thousand and parts per hundred and<br>you have that in landfill leachate you<br>completely overwhelm that difference and<br>you have a very potent estrogenic system<br>and the big goals are we want our rivers<br>lakes and oceans to see revival of fish<br>species you want safer source water<br>human consumption we want drinking water<br>treatment follows and so to pull all<br>this off so we're about here with the<br>new catalyst to pull all this off we<br>need a lot of money and we need<br>partnerships and the university will cut<br>licenses with people to try to make that<br>work I'm just going to go pass this<br>because I'm already speaking too slowly<br>okay so the team is what's me and at<br>Carnegie Mellon design derived by for<br>Russian Kinesis who's whose phenomenal<br>sasha studies the way the catalysts work<br>and he will tell you that these are as<br>well as stood as any any as any Kellogg<br>system water treatment experts Brenau<br>and ret Kenda believes that our<br>technology is going to be a lot cheaper<br>and better than ozone we have a large<br>interaction with Africa that we're<br>trying to fund we have 12 African<br>countries that we have academics in<br>various countries want to play with the<br>catalyst to attack their water problems<br>it's led by this guy dr. Cho Messiah and<br>yakura at university of lagos douglas<br>fisher runs the publication network if<br>you want to understand indirect and<br>disruption just go and get<br>above-the-fold it's free from<br>environmental health sciences that in<br>every day you get information coming<br>into your computer about how camels are<br>impacting the environment Douglas run<br>set biological safety teams led by Julie<br>Jones<br>it has Ruben abuyin who does huge<br>computer calculations of things<br>Bruce Bloomberg Bruce studied the<br>lasts and said well they're not<br>estrogens androgens or thyroid hormones<br>we Heather as I'm not going to talk<br>about her work Fred bond sale this is<br>mister BPA this guy's incredibly famous<br>he discovered the low-dose adverse<br>effects of BPA it's had all sorts of<br>fights industry tried to bribe him and<br>he's were in front of people so he's<br>public about it and has his career has<br>been about fighting to bring reason to<br>EPA and Fred study with Julia Taylor our<br>cameras with mice assays to see if they<br>were causing any problems with the mice<br>and they're not Susan aigo works with us<br>on fracking fluids we have we have we we<br>have wonderful results there where we<br>can remove the in drip and disruption<br>activity of fracking fluids robert tank<br>ways mr. zebra fur she has an enormous<br>zebrafish lab and so you do zebrafish<br>developmental essays where you really<br>find out if you've got problems for<br>indirect and disruption and thomas solar<br>is mister thyroid and down here we've<br>got the strange right who was really<br>really doing fantastic worth with<br>membranes and the cat catalyst so let's<br>come back to the central the central<br>core the thing we did not know that<br>existed in toxicity as a scientific<br>culture as a political culture we didn't<br>know till 1991 there was such a thing as<br>enteric and disruption plenty of signals<br>in the literature but in 1991 this<br>amazing woman Theo Colborn<br>got a group of people together and they<br>oh my god these chemicals are messing up<br>aquatic life by interacting with their<br>intricate homeland system and so an<br>indirect and disruptor is an agent from<br>outside the body that interferes with<br>the release but production release<br>transport binding action or illumination<br>of natural hormones in the body<br>responsible for homeostasis in<br>particularly there<br>regulation of developmental processes<br>now you saw Shana Swan face I don't know<br>if you remember it she was the lady that<br>came about second in the list of<br>speakers Shana has just done a met her<br>analyses of our sperm count studies in<br>Western man we are down 52 percent since<br>1973 52 percent human Mouse sperm counts<br>have dropped in the West 52 percent<br>since 1973 you look at other countries<br>that have sort of more secretive about<br>were more quiet about these things and<br>you see all kinds of problems you you<br>would have thought the Chinese would be<br>in trouble they've only had so we can<br>produce these effects with the chemicals<br>in the lab animal so the Association<br>there is very strong you would have<br>thought the Chinese would be in in<br>trouble because they asked they've on so<br>chemicals so quickly and they are not<br>careful about what they do with the<br>chemicals so around six years ago they<br>don't have a major study of the Chinese<br>population this and my knowledge but<br>around six years ago they studied sperm<br>donors and they had height restrictions<br>and both about 30,000 and 57% passed the<br>bar which is pretty good they did it 18<br>months ago no hype restrictions and 17%<br>passed the bar that's what I would<br>expect knowing knowing because what your<br>what you have is you have this massive<br>assault in the last couple of decades of<br>chemicals into the Chinese environment<br>they're very concerned about water and<br>we're hoping to work with them by the<br>way this is the biggest thing to ever<br>hit chemistry it's like it's like a<br>locomotive coming and hitting it right<br>in the body and how we deal with it<br>again is an enormous test of our<br>fortitude and<br>and character this is the this is the<br>bird put that we put together the tiered<br>protocol for independence rupp ssin that<br>that's one of our meetings and the<br>object is to ensure new new chemicals<br>like like our cameras should not end<br>their degradation products are not<br>Android and disruptors but what do you<br>do about them something like the poll<br>what do we get rid of the power by the<br>way my personal advice to everybody is<br>don't take the poll the visitors have<br>got this incredibly potent estrogen you<br>take a teeny little bit it gets into<br>your into your blood and it fools you<br>that you're if you're a woman that<br>you're pregnant so you don't you don't<br>ovulate and then you go off the pill and<br>it clears pretty quickly and you ovulate<br>but you if you've been on it for a<br>couple years you have to assume that it<br>will have come to equal its fat soluble<br>it will have come to an equilibrium<br>concentration with everything in your<br>body and so once you take the<br>equilibrium input off Lucia Talia's<br>principle is going to take over and the<br>staff will leak back out slowly and you<br>don't even want sub parts per trillion<br>of ethanol estradiol anywhere near a<br>forming fetus I would try barrier<br>technologies and the old-fashioned<br>approaches and I feel I have to say that<br>because of what I've got I've learned<br>about these things so many underpin<br>disruptors are integral to our city way<br>of life you can't a damned if you do if<br>you don't and if you don't deal with<br>them and so one of the things that you<br>can do is much more effective product<br>stewardship so we'll just these are the<br>toxicity studies and I'm going to be<br>right by them looking at the time years<br>I want to but they exist and they're<br>very they're very neat so we'll pass<br>so this is how the cameras work so<br>there's the iron atom in the middle<br>there's the four nitrogens<br>there's the stuff that we change to get<br>the properties that we want and there's<br>a water molecule sitting there oxygens<br>red the two blue things are hydrogen's<br>when you put it with peroxide it just<br>incinerates virtually and it not<br>everything but certainly most of the<br>problematic in Zurich and disruptors so<br>I'm just gonna use a football as the<br>substrate and essentially what happens<br>is this the peroxide lands on the iron<br>you see the football getting oxygen on<br>it and then it gets more oxygen and then<br>after a while of this happening<br>thousands of times per second is<br>shredded to carbon dioxide and small<br>molecules now down in New Zealand I<br>changed the football so what is the<br>football well it's in you die we've done<br>hundreds so you can see it here we're<br>putting peroxide into the water and<br>we'll turn on the stewards and then<br>we'll put we'll put the catalyst in and<br>you can see those molecules decomposing<br>because you can see with your eyes as<br>they disappear<br>and if I leave this running they'll go<br>cut or go colors his decides a number of<br>them a bunch of drugs explosive<br>residuals disinfectants cyano toxin the<br>first one was done by a Russian girl<br>here cylinder sporran just the beginning<br>he's working with a catalyst it's a<br>hundred times less active than our base<br>catalyst we're going after so no toxins<br>in a big way for not so you've get a say<br>in a toxin bloom they put out these<br>toxicants that kill everything but also<br>if you eat species with cyano toxins<br>then they're really not good good for<br>you either sulfur compounds we use them<br>and in sugar diabetes sensors they can<br>be used there the russians develop that<br>various hormones<br>lots of indirect and disrupters the<br>critical thing phenomenal disinfection<br>technology what we really started to get<br>is absolutely phenomenal I'll even split<br>water reasonably were the first water<br>splitting reactions of iron for chemists<br>that and activate Sun activated CH bonds<br>and his mold stain removal so I've shown<br>this here once before it's a technology<br>that was developed at Indianapolis by<br>so you notice the black color<br>the infantile amount of the catalyst in<br>that solution what they would normally<br>do is go in and they scrub with the<br>solution without the catalyst for a<br>couple of days takes to day to day man<br>days of Labor is cut down to less than<br>two hours by the cameras very parent and<br>that's the that's that's not by any<br>means the most active cameras and so<br>here is for a little bit of the science<br>of killing of of things bacterial spores<br>of the ally and tracks or the surrogate<br>that people use Vasilisa Tropius that<br>isn't that doesn't doesn't produce the<br>tripartite toxin it's the hardest thing<br>to call then come the protozoans that<br>people water people are often very<br>worried about then Franconian virus and<br>then vegetative bacteria so we start at<br>the top level at with a bacillus a<br>trophy as anthrax surrogate this is what<br>spore looks like under the scanning<br>electron microscope before you treat it<br>sort of punctate and there's a lot of<br>stuff in the middle when you treat it<br>swells up and its innards squirt out<br>those are the conditions and so you<br>start off with a solution that has 100<br>million colony forming units per<br>milliliter and you you want to get it<br>down to meet the military target you<br>want to get down to 10 in 15 minutes and<br>so as we just increase the concentration<br>log you want log of the number prison<br>amount over the initial number to go to<br>minus seven and fifteen minutes and so<br>nothing much happens with that's a<br>tert-butyl hydroperoxide actually but as<br>you increase you increase the catalyst<br>concentration you see things going<br>faster and at 50 micromolar but by out<br>our stand is the enormous amount but<br>most people's hardly anything you see<br>that gets my account well you know as<br>always i put way too much in the talk<br>and i want to leave some time so i'm<br>going to hook right to the end<br>so our later studies with the city of<br>tucson water<br>we studied 40 microbe pollutants we're<br>using our latest catalyst hydrogen<br>peroxide at 20 parts per million the<br>latest catalyst you are competitive at<br>with 4 parts per million of ozone under<br>those conditions a kilogram of the<br>catalyst will treat 22 and a half<br>thousand tons of water and fast it's all<br>over in an hour<br>22 that quantity of water is the amount<br>produced per day by a hundred and fifty<br>thousand Europeans so we really do think<br>we've got something really enough to<br>here the only thing that could go wrong<br>would be a nasty toxicity surprise and<br>so we're working on that but I want to<br>finish it with a little bit more<br>philosophy so this is just seeing a this<br>this is propanil oh it's a beta blocker<br>many people in the room might be taking<br>propanolol it's it's a micro pollutant<br>spyro actor for tiny concentrations but<br>peroxide and nothing happens our first<br>new camel did a pretty good job our base<br>Baltimore beat it you want it to go to<br>zero as quickly as possible<br>the current this new terminal takes it<br>out that quantity out in less than five<br>minutes you can see that's unbelievable<br>catalysis you have almost no catalyst<br>the 100 nanomolar okay so we have it we<br>think we have a good that come back to<br>this<br>what can New Zealand do well you can<br>train yourself to think well an act well<br>before the greatest challenge our<br>species has ever encountered the<br>universities cannot continue to ignore<br>so it's great to see a green chemistry<br>center here I hope a thrives the five<br>loop approaches my best shot at it you<br>are critical to the good future of New<br>Zealand in this reality that's gonna<br>take much more it's going to take a<br>change at the core of every human being<br>mind and heart save in the woods of hand<br>hands Jonas oh great Gnostic<br>philosopher the survival and humanity of<br>man from the existence of his own power<br>and so just very quickly what does the<br>university do well you know when<br>students come into this university we<br>take all these things and science and<br>put it in their head and University<br>Oakland does that very well I can attest<br>from my own experiences and I know the<br>faculty I know you<br>they're very conscientious but there's<br>all these other things having to do with<br>sustainability the death of first at<br>cetera et cetera you got to put those in<br>at the same time somehow you have to<br>integrate the implications of technology<br>and the student goes out there for<br>equipped to be competent as a<br>sustainability leader we train the<br>leaders of civilization forget about<br>what people think about you now oK we've<br>got all these prizes and things and ok<br>I've got a few but forget about it what<br>really matters is what the future thinks<br>of you because they don't have anybody<br>speaking for them they don't have<br>anybody so forget about being with being<br>being famous and and and all of these<br>other things that academia thrives on<br>and think about the critical thing in<br>the future it's a direction not an<br>endpoint you sure as hell know as we're<br>doing we are the epicenter and<br>Pittsburgh of gas production a net in in<br>in the United States you sure as hell<br>know that's the wrong direction<br>the planet does not need another giant<br>carbon technology it needs soul so it's<br>directional it's tragic what's happening<br>to biodiversity is it's heartbreaking<br>the leaders champion biodiversity as a<br>sort of a first pass credential the the<br>our problem is out session with money<br>and power that dollar bill does not<br>integrate the damage<br>to the future we externalise the damage<br>and leave that to future generations to<br>deal with and we take the cash that you<br>can get use it in the prison you got to<br>figure out how to make jobs wealth and<br>sustain have been mutually re-enforcing<br>I was telling you that early wrong you'd<br>really have to go after these dudes that<br>are creating denying sustainability<br>problems and right now we are in big<br>trouble in the US guideline is what<br>we'll do you have to resist the<br>distortion of science at the expense of<br>the common god these all have a big<br>lecture around them of course I'm sorry<br>just giving it never devalues<br>sustainability for money tribute or<br>political support it's the most precious<br>thing you can imagine and honestly if<br>you've got an ally yourself with people<br>you can trust to me the break faith was<br>sustainability for any reason you're<br>gonna have a great life as a scientist<br>thank you very much for your attention<br>time now for some questions so does<br>anyone have a question they'd like to<br>it's hard to say it's Linea the lines<br>the line over the last decades is linear<br>so it's going to keep going in one<br>assumes the okay so this brings us to<br>the field of epigenetics and it's<br>completely possible to block these<br>disruptions in to future Jets so Mike<br>Skinner at the University of Western<br>Washington exposed female pregnant<br>rodents to an anti-androgen estrogen and<br>the males came up very obviously you can<br>see with mouths they've been<br>reproductively damaged and the postdoc<br>accidentally bred from them they could<br>still breed from them last I heard they<br>were down nine generations nothing had<br>changed they were all damaged so it is<br>very public information' so if you look<br>around and you see where population<br>growth for many reasons obviously but I<br>think chemicals are part of it is a lot<br>and there's some delicate things to say<br>here but they're very public a Christian<br>animal or did a program 6 and love<br>around the world on CNN and she visited<br>Tokyo and I've been to Japan many times<br>and the Japanese hundred hundred thirty<br>five million people on a piece of real<br>estate the size of the United Kingdom<br>but they can only live in eighteen<br>percent of it because it's mostly<br>mountainous and there's nowhere to put<br>the rubbish<br>so they burn it and so Osaka turns out<br>to be the dioxin cap from burning<br>organochlorine waste the dioxin cap cap<br>the world it looks like the Japanese<br>have some severe problems so if you look<br>at their sperm counts the few studies<br>that have been done their rock bottom<br>and what a professor at one of the<br>universities in Tokyo commented publicly<br>forty percent of Japanese adult males<br>are virgins sorry it's tough too tough<br>to talk about<br>if you wherever you find populations<br>very densely concentrated and theory<br>with very great chemical concentrations<br>chemicals of more and more part of their<br>life my guess is you'll see these these<br>effects and I could go on on to to back<br>that up so I don't know some of my<br>friends see it certainly solved the<br>population problem<br>biggest biggest population growths are<br>in Africa Donna Democratic fifty per<br>hundred thousand woman I think Louis to<br>Hong Kong Korea Japan but bbbb is is a<br>wicked awful problem we a friend of mine<br>told me recently that the amount of<br>money made by products with BPA in them<br>there's seven hundred and fifty million<br>dollars per hour at a part of a billion<br>dollars per hour so it's all the TVs and<br>tongues<br>however BPA they use in a lot of ways so<br>it's a radical trap so they'll put it<br>into other polymers that like<br>polypropylene polyethylene for whatever<br>to stabilize them and you know this<br>because you can you can boil them and<br>get stuff out but the major thing is<br>polycarbonate<br>polycarbonate is when you take so BPA is<br>the to phenols the oxygens are out there<br>and you couple them with fuzzy and so<br>you you grant you basically handcuff<br>them together with a co group but that<br>is a hydrolytically sensitive<br>functionality and so once you int once<br>the hard plastics of our TVs are now<br>goodness knows what make their way to<br>the landfill and water starts running<br>over them they Solis did more than 90<br>percent BPA they slowly start leaching<br>BPA that's the landfill problem I know<br>what we do about PP is that's right<br>there are people who have designed bpa<br>analogues that aren't estrogens that's<br>for sure<br>and I spend a lot of time doing that<br>more expensive but you know when you<br>look at what's what's what's happening<br>we at least have to keep talking about<br>a minimalist so what kind of three<br>things<br>I I think actually for someone your age<br>the most important thing you do is<br>protect yourself because you're a you're<br>a maid step to the next generation so so<br>okay so everywhere where you can get<br>chemical so you don't need out of your<br>life is a good thing<br>so all these smells you have in your<br>house like nice smelling things turns<br>out a lot of those are highly<br>problematic certainly try to eat organic<br>by the way if people take activated<br>sludge from from the search treatment<br>part and put it on the land there's<br>plenty of BPA in it and it ends up in<br>the vegetables so if they're using<br>activated sludge it's not exactly<br>organic as a fertilizer<br>I don't think new zealand does that a<br>lot but it's done a lot on the US so so<br>essentially i would try to i would do it<br>that way you in the united states now<br>you have to pay more it's ridiculous you<br>have paid more for non-food but you can<br>you can get chickens that are free-range<br>and that they don't use antibiotics or<br>any anything we had a practice in the<br>united states probably here where people<br>were feeding rocks our solar which is an<br>arsenic compound to chickens lots of it<br>reason is that ask that compounds<br>promote vascular grow so the chicken<br>gets bigger fatter fatter and plump up<br>but the manure was full of arsenic so<br>then the chicken manure was going out<br>and you're putting arsenic all over the<br>place so we we have such a massive<br>re-evaluation to do of all the things<br>that we do to really get this right you<br>and people of your age are really<br>important because we failed we have<br>failed collectively my generators failed<br>so we need you to come in and take over<br>yeah<br>absolutely fantastic question yes there<br>are synergistic effects and we own we<br>know very little about them we we have<br>done some there are some studies where<br>people have taken such a low dose of a<br>series of compounds that there's no<br>observed effect but when you put them<br>all together there's there is an effect<br>and so it appears to be at least<br>additive it may be more than a notice<br>that's yet another major part of the<br>dimensions you see the thing is really<br>to be a catalyst in today's age you<br>really need to know what God knows about<br>how life works so that you don't go and<br>interfere with them and and again the<br>nice thing at least as we know is that<br>there is a the really big thing is it is<br>one thing Indra can disruption and<br>others Sigma there are other signaling<br>pathways that that you can almost tell<br>cells what to become so if you end up<br>taking for example tributyl turn try<br>beautiful nuns used to stop barnacles<br>growing on paint in on on the bottom of<br>ships but if you if you feed tributyl<br>turn to animals it'll go and tell stem<br>cells that wouldn't otherwise do this to<br>go and become fat cells and you'll make<br>them extraordinarily fat all with with<br>diethylstilbestrol which is one of these<br>lucky not really lucky but lucky cases<br>where where we have studies because<br>people were given the drug thinking it<br>was going to be okay and and we could<br>then study the effects but you you give<br>you give one part per billion of<br>diethylstilbestrol to rats they'll blow<br>up like balloons you'd give a hundred<br>parts per billion and they'll be<br>incredibly scrawny that's how the<br>intricate system works the dose response<br>curve is not monotonic in so low and<br>what's more you can take rats and look<br>at the mail<br>our reproductive tract and you it's<br>being put together Etzel mice being put<br>together day 13 through 17 so if you you<br>you give them um the the chemical on day<br>13 14 15 successor and then go look<br>different parts of the reproductive<br>tract will be messed up on the different<br>days really dramatically so so it's very<br>hard when you have a tight end<br>development<br>say the human fetus we've got this all<br>worked out actually a Theo Colborn<br>well-wishes alive set up this wonderful<br>critical stages of development of the<br>baby through from conception to post<br>birth where everywhere where there was a<br>chemical that looked like it hit<br>something she she's signal so we we<br>actually do know quite a lot about it<br>it's a matter of getting our med schools<br>so whenever whenever anybody especially<br>the chemist says before it chemicals<br>chemists tend to circle the wagons and<br>and and say look at all the great things<br>we've done when we have done great<br>things we could not have this<br>civilization without our chemicals so<br>let me just start by saying that I love<br>chemistry and and I know a lot about<br>what chemistry is done for the world and<br>it's absolutely incredible however we<br>have these negative effects and that we<br>have to deal with them and my my net<br>evaluation is if you can avoid<br>antibiotics hormones etc in your food<br>avoiding them right oh yeah you you some<br>of these you effectively taking a low<br>dose of antibiotics by eating some of<br>these things well that messes up your GI<br>tract everybody should take probiotics<br>by way that's another thing because your<br>um your your your GI tract people don't<br>seem to understand how really important<br>that is in taking our food and and<br>breaking it down into the gnudi<br>nutrition that we need and I could<br>describe you studies that that make it<br>crystal clear that having a very high<br>functioning GI tract it's critical to<br>not getting dementia and other things<br>okay I think certainly we are well over<br>time so I better draw things to a close<br>now I'd like to thank you Terry for<br>again<br>a wonderful talk thought-provoking<br>challenging informative talk and ask<br>everybody to join with me and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
