font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we've got a multidisciplinary team of<br>cell biologists we have engineers we<br>have polymer chemists we also have<br>molecular biologists and we have our<br>clinical team and what we're trying to<br>do is all work together to then try and<br>solve some of these really large<br>challenges that we face in in medicine<br>around trying to regenerate or replace<br>damaged or diseased tissues what our<br>vision is the surgery of the future<br>we'll have 3d printers either in surgery<br>or adjacent to surgery and rather than<br>getting a total joint replacement for<br>your knee will able to be able to take<br>yourselves we'll be able to 3d print a<br>solution or a new piece of tissue or neo<br>tissue which would be be able to be<br>implanted back into that damaged damaged<br>region or damaged area<br>so what we're doing here in the lab is<br>that we receive tissue samples from the<br>patient's we isolate the cells it can<br>either be chondrocytes rate can be stem<br>cells from the bone marrow that we<br>extracted<br>we then culture them in tissue culture<br>flasks to get high high cell numbers and<br>we can then use those cells and put them<br>back into the bio inks that we develop<br>that have instructive cues and we can 3d<br>print them into a complex architecture<br>that will be patient specific I'm what<br>we're looking here now under the<br>microscope is some 3d printed bio incus<br>that's being developed in our group and<br>has some living cells in them and we<br>will have to culture them so that they<br>can actually mature into a functional<br>tissue that hopefully can be<br>transplanted into the human the really<br>exciting innovations that we're trying<br>to drive are really in this space around<br>the types of materials and how we go<br>normal 3d printing processes occur at<br>very very high temperatures and you<br>can't include cells into that process so<br>what we need to try and do is either<br>change the 3d printing process or we<br>change the materials that go that are<br>better used and we we actually do both<br>we're very proud of regenerative bits<br>and study group run by social professor<br>Tim Wood field there is a large number<br>of PhD students and postgraduate<br>students involved in this<br>that's certainly cutting edge technology<br>which is recognized worldwide I'm trying<br>to develop these amazing technologies<br>but it's also really you know it's the<br>people these really enthusiastic and<br>excited students and staff that we have<br>in our department that's the thing that<br>really helps drive where we're moving in<br>the future what's exciting with the<br>group is that is it's grown<br>substantially over the years so now<br>we're many more people than when I<br>started my PhD and it actually means<br>that you can get a lot of<br>responsibilities early even as a student<br>I'm supervising students you know<br>helping them to progress into better<br>researchers helping them to solve<br>problems and seeing the growth that they<br>have during their PhD status is really<br>rewarding<br>so I really enjoy working in the group<br>because everyone in the group is really<br>a good friend of mine so we do a lot of<br>things after hours everyone is keen to<br>go on an adventure everyone is<br>supporting each other outside work as<br>well as at work we have this fabulous<br>environment in Christchurch we we work<br>hard but we also play hard we can access<br>mountains for mountain biking amazing<br>access to beach and surf we can be<br>skiing also within hours so when I go to<br>work I actually bike through the park on<br>my way here so it's a beautiful sight<br>especially when we get those sunny days<br>and we also have access to the Botanical<br>Garden where you can go for a walk just<br>clear your mind a bit of science and get<br>some inspiration these are the young<br>scientists we're going to deliver the<br>answers to regenitive medicine problems<br>in I'm certain that also in terms of<br>where where you see the direction of<br>medicine going and how we will see new<br>treatments in the future will really be<br>generated from multidisciplinary<br>research but what is also critical is<br>again we that multidisciplinary research<br>has to be in this clinical setting and<br>that's that's the really great<br>opportunity that we have here at the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
