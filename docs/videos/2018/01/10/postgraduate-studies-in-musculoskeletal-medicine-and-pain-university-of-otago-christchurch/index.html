Designed for health professionals of any discipline, with assessments tailored to fit the setting you work in.<br><br>The programmes are focused on both practical skills and theoretical knowledge from an evidence-based perspective within the biopsychosocial framework endorsed by the International Association for the Study of Pain.<br><br>Participants should become more effective in assessing, diagnosing, managing and rehabilitating people presenting with musculoskeletal and other pain problems, with particular appreciation of the contributions from a range of health professionals in primary and secondary care.<br><br>Critical appraisal skills are taught as part of the programmes, and students may be supported in developing their postgraduate study to master's and eventually PhD level.<br><br>http://www.otago.ac.nz/msm-pain-management</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;
