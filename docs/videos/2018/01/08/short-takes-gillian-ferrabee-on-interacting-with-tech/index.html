effervescent<br>innovative time in the 1980s and 1990s<br>so a Cirque du Soleil hobby Lapage other<br>innovative theater companies all came<br>out of that time and they were already<br>beginning to play a little bit with<br>technology there were people who are<br>playing with dancers in a sound space<br>and what did that look like and so I<br>think it was in our minds already and<br>then I came into Serkan did what is a<br>traditional scouting job scouting for<br>artists scouting for trends and design<br>and the company had been asked many<br>times were they were they were gonna do<br>traditional media like movies or<br>television and it was always no because<br>basically there too at the time there<br>were two different business models and<br>then media became part of everybody's<br>lives and they created a small kind of<br>experimental group it was called special<br>projects I think which was to look at<br>that possibility and after a year and a<br>half they decided to start an actual<br>joint venture a company within the<br>company that was looking at creating any<br>kind of media product from the DNA from<br>the creative essence of Cirque du Soleil<br>when we would meet with big lots of very<br>interesting companies in you know the<br>top companies basically in Hollywood<br>because Cirque was such a big company<br>there in a big disruption they're<br>looking for any kind of interesting<br>out-of-the-box partner that might help<br>them with that disruption<br>we would always hit a point after the<br>second or third meeting they would ask<br>about circus creative process versus the<br>the production process of a movie and<br>there would always be this moment of how<br>different they are so part of my job<br>became to to both wonder about<br>technology that had physical interactive<br>elements to it and also what are the<br>core experiences with digital tools they<br>the conversation about the negative<br>impact of digital technology<br>I think it's everywhere and it's<br>something that is talked about to<br>varying degrees but pretty consistently<br>in the tech world are the concerns about<br>it I'm not by any means a specialist or<br>a researcher I just have my experience<br>and what I've seen is maybe as an artist<br>and a creator that when tech is being<br>developed there isn't enough focus on<br>people actually participating creatively<br>with the technology it's happening more<br>on on with interactive and also with<br>platforms where the user is putting<br>their own content into it<br>there's television shows where they're<br>open sourcing you know some of the<br>characters in animate and cartoon<br>animated shows and people are allowed to<br>make their own episodes this kind of<br>using technology to make more creative<br>possibilities available to people what<br>I'm saying is a general rule is with<br>social media this tendency to almost put<br>our identity out into the virtual space<br>and perhaps with people that the<br>generation that's come into media that's<br>born into these tools their actual sense<br>of self is out in the virtual world and<br>that's a little bit fragile it can<br>create a sense of anxiety but if we give<br>them opportunities to express their<br>creativity in that space and to reflect<br>on their creativity and how that can go<br>into these digital tools and shared<br>virtual spaces then they're getting<br>as a dancer and performer live performer<br>for 20 22 25 years coming into cirque de<br>soleil I'm interested in experiences or<br>sensorial and looking across what's<br>happening in digital tools virtual<br>reality and augmented reality have been<br>the Vanguard's of that in the last five<br>years or so they definitely seem to have<br>more possibility of being of creating<br>more full-bodied experiences because the<br>VR embraces your hearing and your sight<br>fully when you have the headset on and a<br>are can involve physical movement and<br>engagement with the surface on which<br>either the thing that's being projected<br>into space or the surface that the image<br>is on and I think it's really important<br>and important for people to notice not<br>just for our general health as embodied<br>beings but also because if what we're<br>looking for is communication and<br>engagement whether it's in marketing or<br>to for government to pass a message or<br>for a storyteller to tell a story I<br>experience through live performance the<br>when a show is beautifully designed it's<br>such an impactful experience because the<br>person's whole body is sitting in the<br>chair the time of the show and if you<br>see another body moving in front of you<br>you have a kinesthetic experience of<br>them dancing and if you're moved by what<br>they're doing you remember it in your<br>whole body afterwards you don't just<br>remember it as a kind of film in your<br>mind you actually remember your whole<br>body experience so stories that engage<br>people in a way that they remember them<br>later stories that have a message that<br>you want a person to actually go on a<br>journey with you and potentially think<br>differently afterwards if you engage the<br>senses you have a much better chance of<br>that working things that come into our<br>mind passively we're just receiving the<br>information both physically and mentally<br>passively have very little chance of<br>sticking and there were people who<br>expressed to me that they had been to<br>see their first Cirque du Soleil show<br>and they remembered it the same way they<br>remembered their wedding day so that's<br>what I've noticed in the time that I've<br>been engaged with the world of virtual<br>reality augmented reality it's been<br>called mixed reality now is a movement<br>away from the object of let's say the<br>headset or glasses or an object that is<br>going to allow for this kind of content<br>to be brought closer to people into<br>spaces and environments so there's a VR<br>dome that's become very interesting<br>lately Montreal has what's called<br>sociated a South technologic which is a<br>Research Center one of the biggest ones<br>in North America and a few years ago<br>they realized that they were working<br>with business and science and different<br>communities and they hit a wall because<br>they needed to content and storytelling<br>to put into the tools and they turned<br>towards the arts community for that and<br>what's happened since is that the arts<br>community has taken this expansion away<br>from the object the phone the screen the<br>headset into environments so where any<br>window can become a screen any ceiling<br>can become a screen the content and the<br>technology is moving into our physical<br>environment away from just an object<br>that we have to hold and look at and<br>that's interesting to me because it's<br>going to start involving the whole body<br>and I think for businesses that are<br>interested in the evolution of<br>technology and the opportunities there<br>to start paying attention to the arts<br>community and what they are doing with<br>this technology and how they're taking<br>it out into the world away from the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
