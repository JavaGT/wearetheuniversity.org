A multi-year study of the bioluminescence produced by the glowworms has been published today in the highly respected online science journal, Scientific Reports.<br><br>http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/releases/otago676880.html</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we found strangely we didn't expect to<br>but we found that the glow room uses a<br>similar very similar enzyme to what<br>fireflies use even though their<br>evolutionarily speaking millions and<br>millions of years apart from each other<br>and yet a small molecule that they use<br>is<br>totally different from everything else<br>that's been studied before so it's quite<br>a revelation there's also a practical<br>aspect to this because if you can make<br>things glow using small molecular tools<br>you can use them in the laboratory so<br>you could actually ask a question of<br>like why is why to cancer cells are why<br>other cancers or is this cell affected<br>by an infectious disease you can sort of<br>interrogate the cell by finding out is<br>there a particular protein made or a<br>gene made and then have that protein<br>interact with a glowing chemical from<br>those blue from the glowworm and then<br>that chemical becomes reporter to say<br>odd the cell is cancerous<br>this cell is infected or this cells<br>normal and you can do it on a cell by<br>cell basis and it's already being done<br>with other chemicals from other glowing<br>creatures but since the new zealand<br>chemistry seems to be different then it<br>could form a unique set of tools that<br>can be used in combination with other<br>luciferase based research this next step<br>is to prove that structure or that it is<br>something closely related so by chemical<br>synthesis of that because then you know<br>because then we can't have enough<br>material to do experimental work and<br>then understand the mechanisms and then<br>that can lead us through working with<br>the enzymes with the biochemistry as<br>well to making possible by technological<br>tools for development so it was a<br>different way<br>being cellular mechanisms even something<br>like cancer understanding how cells are<br>interacting or changing the other thing<br>that's kind of fun is wearing a bit of a<br>race with Australia because Australia<br>has a glowworm that's related to our<br>glowworm but they're their sort of<br>cousins but different different species<br>and we're in a race to identify how our<br>glowworm works and they're doing the<br>same thing and we've come to kind of<br>different conclusions so we find some<br>some very unique things that they<br>haven't found yet so we're anxious to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
