This will be of interest to those wondering how they got to where they are, those currently making important life decisions and those helping others to do so.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>and so welcome everyone it's great to<br>see you all here I do have a few<br>disclaimers to start off with so the<br>first one is that Russell and I aren't<br>neuroscientists so we're we're<br>practitioners but we're really<br>interested in this area the second kind<br>of comes from that first disclaimer<br>which is that we've only got an hour and<br>we could talk for hours and hours and<br>hours about this topic because we really<br>are so interested in it so we're going<br>to try very hard to stick to time we've<br>got a colleague here in the front loader<br>who's going to signal us if we sort of<br>start talking too much so she's our time<br>Wrangler you're welcome to ask questions<br>as we talk if we do start to run out of<br>time then we might just have to park<br>those questions but what to see how we<br>go and then the final thing is you will<br>be sent the PowerPoint so you can relax<br>and if you were thinking of taking notes<br>you won't need to so in terms of what<br>we're covering so decision-making so<br>we'll have a brief look at<br>decision-making and then we'll talk in<br>particular about the importance of the<br>prefrontal cortex about the important<br>the importance of the early years in<br>your life and then also how sort of this<br>knowledge can help with career<br>decision-making neuroscience is actually<br>a really young field so we've gone from<br>dissecting people's brains to reading<br>the bumps on people's heads to figure<br>out what their personality is apparently<br>around about here as your morals so<br>that's where we've got veneration<br>benevolence hope spirituality it's all<br>this part of the brain apparently<br>however now we've got magnetic resonance<br>imaging so MRI so that happened around<br>about the Sigma T's and 80s so we didn't<br>have to read bumps and we didn't have to<br>cut up brains to actually get an idea of<br>what was happening the great thing about<br>MRIs is you can get people to do a task<br>conceal which part of the brain is<br>actually illuminated so that's way<br>better than cutting up did want to tell<br>you a lot more however we still actually<br>them now don't fully understand the<br>processes so we're still learning about<br>this we do know that there's a number of<br>areas and the brain involved in<br>decision-making but we're focused on the<br>prefrontal cortex because it actually<br>matures really slowly and it's got a lot<br>of implications for making career<br>decisions so that's why we're focusing<br>particularly on it actually before I<br>start talking about decision making I've<br>got a question for you so what is the<br>average age at which human beings are<br>likely to make rational decisions about<br>important events in their lives 25 okay<br>what else any other ages Tim never okay<br>why never I think you're just thinking<br>about guys what were some of the other<br>ages thirty okay what else<br>thirty-five this is really interesting<br>cuz if you think about it what age can<br>you drive a car drink alcohol join the<br>army and shoot people it's quite scary<br>isn't it what age you tried is an adult<br>and yet none of you see it under 20 so<br>here's a lot of implications the answer<br>is it depends it depends on so many<br>factors and Russell will be talking more<br>about those factors in a little while<br>but in terms of decision-making so our<br>decisions make us who we are so at each<br>fork in the road that we come to we've<br>got to make some sort of decision and<br>then that influences us until we get to<br>the next fork and the next fork so<br>effective decision-making it's not just<br>it's not possible without motivation and<br>meaning and that's provided by our<br>emotional and pot so there are studies<br>that they've done so there was one<br>particular<br>who he had an injury to his limbic<br>system which is where your emotions are<br>seated so you would think I can't<br>remember how old he was but say thirties<br>you would think that that would turn him<br>to a Spock like character that could<br>make very precise rational decisions no<br>he was paralyzed by indecision we<br>actually need our emotions as well as<br>our rational prefrontal cortex we need<br>both and we need them to work together<br>so Russell will talk more about that in<br>a little while but essentially our<br>prefrontal cortex takes a long time to<br>develop and the connections between the<br>limbic system where our emotions are and<br>the prefrontal cortex that takes a while<br>to mature as well so there's we need the<br>rational prefrontal cortex there's three<br>core executive functions and you've got<br>impulse inhibition working memory and<br>cognitive flexibility and they're all<br>interrelated they seem to underpin<br>processes such as goal setting planning<br>prioritizing sustaining and switching<br>attention initiating and monitoring<br>actions so we need those three to do<br>those things we need them to help us<br>self-regulate and stop and think and<br>they're crucial for career<br>decision-making all of those things if<br>you think about it you need them to make<br>career decisions so I've got another<br>question for you so how old were you<br>when you were first asked what do you<br>cool five there's probably some people<br>who are still being asked it as an adult<br>yeah absolutely I got a bit for quite a<br>while actually how did that make you<br>feel when you were five years old being<br>asked that question yeah okay I actually<br>told Tim that I was going to ask him<br>this mm-hm<br>yeah that was me as well I don't know<br>how old I was when I first got the<br>question but I do know that I was about<br>14 and there was one side of the family<br>didn't know that well and the aunt that<br>I was most scared of right this woman<br>terrified me she actually later on it<br>was okay but I was still really scared<br>of her and she asked me that treated<br>Christian surrounded by other uncles and<br>aunts and also I was very shy as well<br>and I got that question and it's sort of<br>like I mumbled I didn't know what do you<br>mean you don't know you don't know by<br>now yeah I still remember it's the<br>emotions emotions associates I'm<br>associated with that memory so at a time<br>when we're expected to make decisions<br>about our careers our prefrontal cortex<br>isn't fully mature and as I see it<br>before sort of like the limbic system<br>that isn't probably connected with the<br>prefrontal cortex<br>we're supposed to make these decisions<br>at 2 5 10 12 14 18 I'm not saying you<br>can't make good decisions when the brain<br>isn't fully mature of course you can but<br>it's more difficult and I think that<br>leads on to<br>thank you very much yeah very welcome<br>okay so what I'm going to do is I'm just<br>going to do a little bit of science<br>behind the brain and like Petter says<br>I'm really really interested in this<br>this came about probably about two years<br>ago so working in careers and I just had<br>this underlying feeling that in the<br>careers industry we're actually not<br>serving our clients well usually young<br>people I thought that we just didn't<br>understand what was going on so I did<br>quite a lot of research to try and find<br>out who actually knows about the brain<br>sure you find it in academia and you<br>find people who are neuro scientists but<br>it's really hard to find somebody who<br>talks openly about how the brain<br>functions so I came across a guy called<br>Nathan Wallace okay now some of you may<br>have come across Nathan because he does<br>an awful lot of talks especially in<br>early childhood centers schools and he<br>talks about young people you'll find him<br>on Katherine Ryan 9 to noon he does a<br>lot of parenting stuff so Nathan and I<br>have done workshops I've sat down and<br>talked to Nathan and I've asked him so<br>many questions he was a neuroscience<br>educator and is and does an awful lot of<br>work on there see if you ever get the<br>chance to go and see him Nathan Wallace<br>go he's really really interesting but<br>some of the things that he's started<br>talking about is the brain so I think<br>one of the things you've got to be<br>really careful about is these terms that<br>they use like adolescents you actually<br>can't define what adolescence is with<br>neuroscientists it seems to change so<br>this has come from MIT not our friends<br>down the road man account ok the other<br>one that's somewhere in the states so<br>you know this is sort of like puberty<br>2:18 is the sense of adolescence what<br>they know through those fMRI MRI scans<br>is that the brain goes through a huge<br>change okay large growth and pruning<br>pruning of the nerves that are inside<br>the brain ok and I'll talk a little bit<br>more about that<br>and it generally is from the back to the<br>front so as Peter says the bit that's<br>the prefrontal cortexes sits behind your<br>forehead ok this is the last part of the<br>brain that usually matures it's engaged<br>and it is but when you and I'm talking<br>to the parents here excuse me but if<br>you've got adolescents teenagers usually<br>you know when they're in that stage<br>because they're in<br>emotional all right there is no<br>self-restraint in those kind of things<br>so at eight up to about 18 and again at<br>that 18 you know there is this change<br>going on there's a new term that's come<br>out which is called emerging adulthood<br>okay so it's the bit between adolescence<br>and adulthood generally 18 to 22 or<br>probably 25 now as Peter says when a you<br>an adult when is the brain mature the<br>problem is that there is no blue spot in<br>the brain that turns blue when you're<br>mature it depends it just happens<br>and it's really interesting you could<br>talk to and we do talking to 18 19 year<br>olds they're totally different - if you<br>talk to postgrads<br>they're totally different - mature<br>students in their 30s because you can<br>see the change in the brain so what<br>happens is that prefrontal cortex starts<br>to develop okay the executive functions<br>as they call them start to come on<br>planning planning ahead evaluating risks<br>and rewards interestingly neuroscience<br>that the moment is focusing on a lot of<br>the deficits that are happening in<br>society so there's an awful lot of<br>research around things like mental<br>health suicide the effect of drink drugs<br>and drink on young people if you ever<br>try and find something about<br>neuroscience and career decision-making<br>there is nothing absolutely nothing it's<br>like the careers industry is stuck in<br>the dark ages somewhere so I have to<br>tell you this taught that you're getting<br>now you will not get anywhere else in<br>New Zealand all right and in fact you<br>probably want to get it anywhere else<br>like Australia or around the world I<br>have done so much research to try and<br>find people and it's just dark space<br>okay so those evaluating risks and<br>rewards that's why young people make<br>silly mistakes Nigel later talks about<br>this an awful lot you know if you've got<br>a young son all right do you want to<br>increase the increase the dangers of<br>them having a car accident put their<br>best mate in the seat next to them if<br>you want to increase it again put their<br>two mates in the back and usually the<br>kind of things that you hear is why did<br>you<br>do that I don't know it's a natural<br>reaction because the frontal cortex<br>which is about reasoning is not really<br>online it's that they're still in the<br>limbic brain so problem-solving thinking<br>head self-evaluation the two things that<br>are happen myelination is about<br>insulation it's about making the nerves<br>and the connections happen quicker so<br>some of the things that they're doing<br>and the research is that young people<br>when they solve problems they can solve<br>them as fast as adults but in some ways<br>they're not using the same parts of the<br>brain different parts of the brain light<br>up so what does that mean well probably<br>what's happening is the brain is trying<br>to figure out where those easy<br>connections are which are most efficient<br>and most effective can I just sort of<br>say here and now that teenagers of today<br>are no different over past we are we<br>were exactly the same if you were my age<br>you know early 30s I only say that<br>because I want to know you listening<br>right and synaptic pruning that's the<br>pruning the nervous the ones that are<br>used and the ones that are not used this<br>is the whole thing like when you say<br>you're hardwired when you're set in<br>stone interestingly those beliefs and<br>ideas that you have of yourself can be<br>changed and that's you know there's a<br>lot of work going on in the states that<br>people who believe that they haven't got<br>a hope and there's no point if you<br>actually put them through certain<br>programs they do change the way they<br>think the brain is plastic it does mold<br>so when you said does it ever end no<br>there's some evidence say in 6070 years<br>of age that it's still happening okay so<br>there is quite a lot of stuff going on<br>but as you can see it's from 18 onwards<br>where some of the executive functions<br>are starting to come into interplay so<br>our question and my question start off<br>with was at 18 when you leave school how<br>on earth do you make a good decision how<br>on earth do we expect you and the fact<br>is at 18 when you leave school how long<br>has that been around forever<br>so shouldn't we be<br>moving with the times later adulthood<br>mid-twenties or older full maturity of<br>the brain and the executive functions<br>okay now interestingly again he talked<br>to Nathan he will say there's an awful<br>lot of research in terms of how quickly<br>business does this work how quickly do<br>you come to a free frontal cortex when<br>do you hear it I hear it because God<br>often I get students who come in and<br>they start talking in a very logical<br>coherent way okay and I will actually<br>say to them I'm going to ask you a<br>really strange question<br>what are you firstborn yes so Nathan's<br>idea and the research seems to suggest<br>this is that the first 1,000 days are<br>incredibly important for the development<br>of the brain not in terms of how it<br>develops but when it develops have you<br>seen the adverts on the TV the first<br>1,000 days that's come from Nathan all<br>right you're hearing them an awful lot<br>saying about it so it's the first 1,000<br>days which is from conception to nine<br>months and then afterwards the most<br>important thing is the dyadic<br>relationship the usual thing is it's the<br>most dominant parent usually mum and<br>it's the talk if you think about it<br>first born quite often it's this what<br>happens then is if you have another<br>child usually you've got a two-year-old<br>running around while you're trying to<br>talk to your second one and you're going<br>oh it's so cute hey what you doing<br>so that sort of interrupts it and the<br>evidence and the research suggests that<br>what that possibly does is it delays the<br>development of the prefrontal cortex now<br>if you've got two three four children<br>you think about what your first ones<br>like to what your fourth one is like<br>other evidence that it can be cited the<br>most underrepresented population in New<br>Zealand prisons is first born female<br>puberty has an impact on this naturally<br>puberty happens in women earlier than it<br>does for guys firstborn females most<br>under-represented population in New<br>Zealand prisons on that basis which do<br>you think are the most over-represented<br>third board fourth born male why because<br>it's 16 17 18<br>they make stupid decisions what were you<br>thinking<br>I just did it because he said all right<br>it is also in context so if you have a<br>firstborn or a second born or a third<br>born again statistically the firstborn<br>in the family is the most successful<br>money job career those kind of things<br>but there are exceptions always<br>exceptions so it depends on things<br>here's a case say for example you've got<br>a girl born but what happens is they're<br>born to a sole parent okay now it's not<br>a bad thing but that could be a step to<br>this way which is okay it's going to<br>delay frontal cortex mum also suffers<br>from mental health mum is quite isolated<br>with no family so you see with the<br>context things can start to develop<br>where it is going to affect the<br>development of the brain now they know<br>this one of the classics is the whole<br>thing around Romanian Refugee ins you<br>know the ones that are in the nurseries<br>no contact whatsoever the amount of<br>delay in terms of brain development<br>around that but at the same time if<br>you've got mum who's a sole parent okay<br>speaks two languages which indicates<br>possibly about you know being bilingual<br>has some impact on brain development<br>is surrounded by family has really good<br>support has actually got an academic<br>education up to masters level so you see<br>that context is really quite important<br>so you have to sort of say yeah here's<br>the brain and here's the development but<br>you have to take things into context as<br>well which makes it incredibly difficult<br>especially when we sit in front of a<br>student who comes in and goes so I'm<br>so the main changes that we see at<br>puberty 2:18 again if you're a mum and<br>dad you'll see this young people you<br>will notice this but you get better<br>abstract thinking seeing patterns and<br>understanding things like fairness okay<br>they start to understand how the world<br>starts to operate still a bit limited<br>with right and wrong I've got a 19 year<br>old daughter you were wrong to do that<br>no one you shouldn't have said this I<br>said that because of what you did and<br>what you said nah okay so straightaway<br>I'm like I know she's in a limbic brain<br>I know she's in a limbic brain and me<br>trying to rationalize and reason with<br>her I might as well forget it<br>so I just sort of take a step back<br>that's a point for parents actually<br>oh yeah so interestingly with my<br>daughter after I heard this with Nathan<br>two years ago of course she's in the<br>year 12 and I just sort of said to her<br>look I actually think that when I try<br>and talk to you you're in your limbic<br>brain can I just say if you ever want to<br>hear young people in their limbic brain<br>all right get on a bus in front of two<br>or three young people and all you'll<br>hear is every third word is not like<br>like it's so cool<br>that's them in their limbic brain all<br>right if you ever want to talk to a<br>young person when they're in the limbic<br>brain you're wasting your time so I<br>realized this with my daughter and I<br>thought I've got to pick the time when<br>she's probably going to come into a<br>frontal cortex because they do naturally<br>so I said to it is it first thing in the<br>morning I don't think so when you wake<br>up to it mmm no okay she's gorgeous my<br>daughter by the way when you come home<br>from school I don't think that because<br>you're tired you're hungry you want to<br>get on Facebook and find out what your<br>friends are doing yeah probably I said<br>but have you ever noticed you know about<br>five six seven o'clock at night you just<br>come wandering out all right dad has a<br>going it's going good<br>now's my opportunity now it changes with<br>everybody but I know that if I want to<br>talk to my daughter<br>I have to listen whether she's in my<br>limbic brain parents if you're actually<br>talking to a young person and you've got<br>a great conversation they're brother and<br>sister walks in the door you've got no<br>chance because all of a sudden limbic<br>brain and limbic brain Trump's frontal<br>cortex<br>all right so if you ever want to hear it<br>cichlid sit next to a group of young<br>people at a cafe on a bus listen to them<br>talk oh look look look<br>limbic brain trying to get any reasoning<br>out of them forget it<br>so up to eighteen intense emotions and<br>thrill-seeking there's a guy called lon<br>Steinberg he's a psychologist and he<br>talks a lot about this as well and he<br>says really with the limbic brain it's<br>like an accelerator on a car it's flat<br>to the floor the frontal cortex are the<br>brakes<br>that's about regulation should you do<br>this no again Nigel later talks about a<br>great story you can have a really great<br>conversation with young people young<br>guys and then all of a sudden their mate<br>will meet them outside the door and go<br>hey why don't we get in my car go down<br>the road and see how fast we can go and<br>then afterwards you go why did you do<br>that they go oh don't I<br>that's them not being able to apply the<br>brakes all right that's the frontal<br>cortex that's a good indicator so when I<br>get young people in sat in front of me<br>and they're talking very coherently<br>about so I'm going to do this and that<br>and I'm already thinking ahead and<br>everything how old are you 19 are you<br>first born yes again Nathan talks about<br>he did a survey in Christchurch there<br>were a hundred gifted kids 50 boys 50<br>girls he did say to me says the girls<br>were certainly gifted some of the boys<br>weren't he says I think they were making<br>other numbers but after a while he just<br>sort of decided he just turned around<br>anyway random question how many of you<br>are first born out of a hundred how many<br>do you think put the hand up 90 so you<br>know even at that age you know there's a<br>lot to be said for this so we've got to<br>start to understand this and that the<br>context and the implications are really<br>important between 18 and 20 to 25 you<br>start to see more complex thinking they<br>put together abstract ideas values a<br>sense of self actually this is really<br>important this sense of self Who am I<br>where is my place in the world<br>what is important<br>what do I think about if you think about<br>it they're very abstract ideas and if<br>you have not got your frontal cortex<br>coming online very often they are sort<br>of light so I'm really am really yeah I<br>think I'll do I look good oh and then<br>food this will happen it's a bit of<br>distraction trying to hold those ideas<br>really hard for young people so abstract<br>ideas like what do you want to do when<br>you finish really hard<br>they appreciate diverse views yeah I can<br>see what you're seeing you know put<br>themselves in other people's shoes they<br>actually get better at doing that better<br>emotional self control they apply the<br>brakes but the last point is really<br>important it's very new it's not going<br>to be done all the time it takes time<br>and it takes practice unfortunately<br>parents you've got to have patience okay<br>and really encouraging those kind of<br>things all right mid 20s and older<br>that's when you see it so like I say<br>when PhD students come in and they're<br>usually in their late 20s early 30s<br>conversations I have about who they<br>think they are are far more different to<br>a young person at 19 20 totally<br>different one their frontal cortex is<br>definitely engaged they're able to think<br>of things abstract ideas talk about what<br>they think about all right and actually<br>I've just done had a lot more experience<br>which is really important oh good cool<br>yeah<br>yes yes look I think I think sometimes<br>if you really want to just get onto<br>YouTube alright and you know stupid<br>people and you will see it and you know<br>it's like the limbic brain is always<br>there and again that probably comes<br>again from family upbringing you know<br>and there are some people who are in the<br>frontal cortex but they don't make great<br>decisions and get very emotional you<br>know people who fly off the handle all<br>the time<br>okay what's going on because that's the<br>limbic brain yeah because what happens<br>is your frontal cortices guide yeah I'll<br>have a glass of wine you have a glass of<br>wine I don't want a sudden your limbic<br>brain takes over any girl gonna have the<br>bottle and then next day your frontal<br>cortex comes out and lining it goes<br>earlier hell what was I thinking I don't<br>know I don't know I bet you know this no<br>matter how old you are you've been out<br>and then next day you've got the hell<br>was I thinking what did I do<br>usually that is not likely because all<br>of a sudden that common sense logical<br>person that you are just goes out the<br>window<br>that's only the influence which is why<br>they're interested in the effect of<br>drugs and drink on young people and how<br>that most people the cause of death is<br>accidents them doing things that are<br>create that in accidents<br>it's the biggest cause of death for<br>young people they're not doing things<br>where you go why did you do that don't<br>which is where we are fully developed<br>and intent logical reason do you ever<br>get to that point is enormous a a PhD<br>student to be good with that track I<br>give them way back yeah I would say so I<br>don't think you're never gonna be not in<br>your limbic brain there are gonna be<br>times I'll tell you when you find that<br>you're in your limbic brain is when your<br>best friend that you haven't seen for 20<br>years suddenly appears and you start<br>talking and you get really excited you<br>see it in young people best time of your<br>life is 18 when you're getting flooded<br>with all these chemicals dopamine<br>usually when you start laughing because<br>your friends laughing and you're going<br>what we laugh now don't know but as an<br>adult you will get to that stage with<br>some people so you will flit in and out<br>of your I think what we're saying what<br>seems to be said is that as an adult you<br>can keep in your frontal cortex for<br>longer to young people that's why we are<br>boring you know we're incredibly boring<br>to young people because we're in our<br>frontal cortex and we're so logical<br>that's why you can stand at the<br>breakfast bar and you can make breakfast<br>for everyone<br>you can make the lunches you can think<br>about what you're going to do afterwards<br>do your shopping and you're trying to<br>say to someone who's 17 have you got<br>your bag they wander into the room and<br>then they come out and they haven't got<br>the bag didn't you go and get your bag<br>or forgot so we stay in our frontal<br>cortex but quite happily we can go<br>backwards and forward so the frontal<br>cortex is about exercising control over<br>your limbic brain to suppress it and<br>keep it under control a little bit some<br>okay so no I actually there is the<br>research around neuroscience is very<br>conflicted so if you want to prove<br>something you can prove something all<br>right<br>so the whole thing around social media<br>if you think about who's actually saying<br>that it's usually adults who probably<br>don't understand that social media and<br>they see the impact of people in their<br>phones doing this all the time when I<br>was a kid I was told off all the time<br>for watching television my parents were<br>told off for playing with a hope and a<br>stick you know so we're always being<br>told not to do something because that's<br>the fad but there is very little<br>evidence around that is very conclusive<br>to say what impact social media<br>computers TV violent games<br>it's very inconclusive we have to be<br>really careful and one of the things I<br>will say here is that the whole thing<br>around neuroscience you've got to be so<br>careful because you can actually make it<br>say what you want it to say so things<br>like those people who say this will help<br>your children develop do you see the<br>story a few weeks ago about the place in<br>Australia that had that claim and they<br>were bringing it into New Zealand and<br>they were saying put them in this school<br>or this program and they will be you<br>know in more intelligent you can't claim<br>that there are some educational and<br>other people who are claiming things<br>that are not true neuroscientists will<br>go we haven't got enough research we've<br>only been doing this 10 or 15 years we<br>haven't got a longitudinal study to say<br>what's true and what's not so we can<br>only infer and then think that may day<br>it's a bit like advice we get about you<br>know diets you know one minute wine is<br>bad for you the next minute red wines<br>great chocolate is bad for you dad<br>chocolate is good and so at the moment<br>they're still discovering all of this<br>still burning I'd like to think jogging<br>is really bad for you<br>let's leads me into mindfulness as a<br>superpower so there's lots of things we<br>can do to sort of like a doe brain sort<br>of improve our sort of like decision<br>making so obvious things such as<br>exercise sorry<br>nutrition so diet so yep two slices two<br>squares of dark chocolate a night are<br>good the whole block not so good so<br>these things like that there's also<br>planning so we need to be able to plan<br>but how many of us have taught how to<br>plan it's not usually something that's<br>taught when you get to university you<br>might learn about short-term and<br>long-term planning but it would be nice<br>if you could actually learn about those<br>things earlier time management how many<br>of us are taught about time management<br>so those sorts of things will actually<br>help but I want to talk a bit about<br>mindfulness because it actually studies<br>have shown that it does actually change<br>the brain so what is mindfulness it's a<br>super power you will see a part of this<br>that the driver is a mimic<br>you may have heard this word mindfulness<br>it's become something of a buzz phrase<br>of late I'm gonna give you one simple<br>serviceable definition which is this<br>mindfulness is the ability to know<br>what's happening in your head at any<br>given moment without getting carried<br>away by it imagine how useful this could<br>be just as an example driving down the<br>road and somebody cuts you off in<br>traffic how do you normally react I<br>think most of us we normally react by<br>having a thought which is I'm pissed and<br>then what happens next<br>you immediately habitually reflexively<br>inhabit that thought you actually become<br>pissed there's no buffer between the<br>stimulus and your reaction with just a<br>little bit of mindfulness in that same<br>situation you might notice my chest is<br>buzzing my ears are turning red I'm<br>having a starburst of self righteous<br>thoughts I'm getting angry but you don't<br>necessarily have to act on it and chase<br>that person down the road screaming at<br>them with your kids in the back of the<br>car thinking you've gone nuts<br>now you might be thinking don't I need<br>to get angry sometimes aren't I<br>justified<br>I would say yes but probably not as much<br>as you think the proposition here is not<br>that you should be rendered by<br>mindfulness into some lifeless<br>non-judgmental blob the proposition is<br>that you should learn how to respond<br>wisely to things that happen to you<br>rather than just reacting blindly<br>and that my friends is a superpower how<br>do you get it<br>the way to get it is through meditation<br>I believe that meditation and<br>mindfulness are the next big public<br>health revolution in the 1940s if you<br>told somebody you were going running<br>they would have said who's chasing you<br>but then what happened next the<br>scientist swooped in they showed that<br>physical exercise is really good for you<br>and now all of us do it and if we don't<br>we feel guilty about it and that's where<br>I think we're headed with mindfulness<br>and meditation it's gonna join the<br>pantheon of no-brainers like brushing<br>your teeth eating well and taking the<br>meds your doctor prescribed for you let<br>me just close by saying mindfulness is<br>not gonna solve all of your problems<br>it's not gonna render your life a<br>non-stop parade of unicorns and rainbows<br>nonetheless this is a superpower and one<br>that is accessible by you immediately a<br>shout out for the University of Auckland<br>website so if you just go on to Auckland<br>on a CNC slash wellbeing there's that<br>DVD and these other videos as well or<br>equally funny and cute but also really<br>on point and these other information I<br>mean about the importance of nutrition<br>and exercise and everything else so why<br>did I focus on mindfulness it's because<br>brain imaging shows that it does<br>actually physically change your brain in<br>a good way so basically it sort of like<br>it makes changes in areas relating to<br>all of those types of thinking so<br>complex thinking decision-making<br>introspection the emotion regulation etc<br>so what apparently happens is that you<br>develop a thicker layer of neurons in<br>your prefrontal cortex that's a good<br>thing and also other areas of the brain<br>which I won't go into a 2013 study<br>showed that 15 minutes of mindful<br>meditation you've got to do this<br>regularly so it's not enough to do 10<br>minutes every week or so but if you do<br>it regularly so 15 minutes of mindful<br>meditation can help people make smarter<br>choices<br>studies studies have shown that<br>mindfulness helps to lead to better<br>decision-making a brief period of<br>mindfulness allows you to make more<br>rational decisions because you actually<br>consider the information available in<br>the present moment and then you can do<br>what Russell was saying is difficult for<br>younger people people with a least fully<br>mature prefrontal cortex and let's think<br>about the future think about positive<br>future outcomes so just that little<br>moment of pause and you can also do<br>something called the neuro economic cost<br>of a decision so mindfulness and I think<br>Russell is now going to put it all<br>together oh okay hold on to your seats<br>here we go any questions<br>any more questions good you still with<br>us hey excellent okay so one of the<br>things that I think is you've got to<br>hang on to this idea of neuroscience and<br>what better was just talking about with<br>mindfulness is that what they call<br>metacognition thinking about what you're<br>thinking about actually it's really okay<br>to steer our fin to the distance and<br>lose yourself that's sort of that kind<br>of thing it's don't feel guilty about it<br>I think what you've got to be really<br>careful about is there are some people<br>who are going to do that and like I said<br>in some context they're going to have<br>really quite negative thoughts that's<br>really quite dangerous that leads to<br>depression so there's a lot of interest<br>around the whole thing around mental<br>health and depression and how that<br>happens I was just reading the study<br>that's done that Victoria University has<br>just come out and they've sort of talked<br>to young people and you know if you can<br>get them to think in a more positive way<br>when I feel happy I have been it can<br>change that so it's about thinking about<br>what you think about I'll take for<br>granted that most of us are positive<br>people so that's it now putting it all<br>together in terms of the career<br>decision-making I think we've got this<br>wrong badly Ronald okay so when students<br>come in and talk to me they go<br>this degree become I've got two majors<br>what can I do with it I know that the<br>worst question you can ever ask a young<br>person at university and at school if<br>you've got teenagers and they're at<br>university or at school don't ever ask<br>them when you finish school or finish<br>uni what are you going to do every young<br>person goes don't ask me that question<br>because behind every question there's a<br>statement the statement is you know what<br>you're doing and most young people go<br>have no clue so we always start with<br>what do you want to do wrong question<br>where you should start is the other end<br>now you'll see this if any of you have<br>been online recently you'll see a guy<br>called simon Sinek<br>and he talks about the golden circles i<br>think he stole my idea honestly i really<br>do think this now he lee there's YouTube<br>LinkedIn to talk about 2009 I've applied<br>this more to career decision-making so<br>he talks about the golden circles what<br>is what most consumers or businesses<br>actually focus on we should focus on why<br>why now why are you doing this degree<br>but the hope why why do you want to do<br>it<br>it's about purpose big questions like if<br>you could change one thing in the world<br>overnight what would it be what concerns<br>you what issues do you get really upset<br>about now if you think about it young<br>people don't get ever get asked that in<br>fact they don't get asked at school they<br>don't get asked at uni and I'm going to<br>say here what are we teaching them<br>because I think we do need to teach them<br>and as parents you've got to ask your<br>kids this what concerns you because if<br>they understand what purpose is they<br>then understand the next bit which is<br>the hell this is their degree if they<br>understand what the purpose is then that<br>make sense as regards what they're<br>studying so I say to them what are you<br>studying the be calm I'm doing this ok<br>that's great I can't answer that<br>question at the end we'll come to that<br>but I need to go back I need to talk to<br>you about<br>what is your purpose what are the things<br>that are important to you because if we<br>start to uncover that then what happens<br>is that line there means that this<br>starts to link more closely it's a<br>really hard concept so if you go back to<br>the neuroscience the frontal cortex it's<br>an abstract thought young people are<br>usually developing a sense of purpose<br>there was a study done by a guy called<br>Bill diamond big study in the States 20%<br>of young people<br>he found have a sense of purpose there<br>are others about 40 45 percent that are<br>developing a sense of purpose they call<br>some dabblers and dreamers worryingly<br>that the rest have no sense of purpose<br>and both given up I don't know what it<br>is in New Zealand but I wouldn't say<br>that we're too far away from that kind<br>of statistic so one of the things we<br>need to do is change our focus to<br>purpose talk to young people about what<br>concerns them I would have to say that<br>these young people today probably<br>because of parenting and it's been more<br>liberal and I'm talking about my parents<br>my parents the way they parented me is<br>not the way I parented my daughter I'm<br>far more about what I want to talk about<br>what do you want to talk about coming<br>talk to me so you find that young people<br>today when they say I want to work for<br>somebody who's got morals and values and<br>things I believe in they've actually<br>leapfrogged us we only start thinking<br>about that in our 30s and 40s in fact we<br>get to our 40s midlife crisis what is<br>midlife crisis all of a sudden you've<br>been putting up with things for so long<br>you get to midlife kids have left home<br>and suddenly you go I don't need to put<br>up with this anymore I don't need to pay<br>that I don't need to earn this weight I<br>could do whatever I like that's midlife<br>crisis all right young people are<br>starting their earlier in their 20s you<br>can hear it in the way they cop they<br>talk and that's from liberal parenting<br>they are no different to us it's just<br>the context the most important thing as<br>well is not only the neuroscience behind<br>it but this is informed by experience<br>again if you think about 18 year olds<br>what experience have they got they've<br>been to school they've played some sport<br>they've maybe had a part-time job<br>they've lived in a family they might<br>have been lucky and being overseas what<br>else have they done experience informs<br>purpose it gives you a better sense of<br>this is what I like this is not what I<br>like I believe in this and it's really<br>important because that sense of purpose<br>develops because you look back on your<br>life and you make Co hit you see the<br>continuity and the coherence I remember<br>as a kid when I was five six seven some<br>things that I've only just started to<br>think about I have a strong sense of<br>what's right and wrong and justice<br>things happened to me and I could talk<br>to you about them that I went that's not<br>fair<br>and I got punished for things at school<br>by my mum and dad annoyed that's not<br>fair so I've got a real deep level sense<br>of trying to help people who can't help<br>themselves<br>because I don't believe that some people<br>are in that situation because of<br>themselves the society the system<br>whatever so through my work I started<br>off as a school teacher the kids I<br>really liked bottom set 4g8 you know<br>they turn up with statement Davis<br>statement if they've got teacher aides<br>there were more teacher aides in the<br>class than kids oh my god love them wide<br>because it's my sense of justice I've<br>had long contracts with work and income<br>helping people who can't help themselves<br>people who are vulnerable that is my<br>purpose everything I do is served by<br>that purpose it makes sense therefore<br>that anything I do interning learn terms<br>of learning skills and knowledge is<br>going to be linked to that and whatever<br>work I do my career title is always<br>going to be that so what and where I<br>work allows me to affect change it<br>allows me to put into play what I think<br>is important to meet my purpose the<br>further away you are from that line you<br>call it a job get a bit closer it's a<br>career when you sit on that line you<br>feel it's a calling you would do it for<br>no money<br>there are some people who would work for<br>Greenpeace and they believe in<br>Greenpeace but all they do is a job why<br>because they are far enough away they're<br>probably doing administration stuff<br>whereas what they really want to do is<br>they want to do more activist stuff they<br>want to get involved bureaucracies are<br>really good at pushing people out into<br>jobs so if you feel bored in your job<br>you've got to sort of think to yourself<br>what's my purpose and how far away from<br>the line am I you know a job stands for<br>just over broke the other thing is for<br>young people if they're in their limbic<br>brain for 90% of the time it's really<br>hard for them with the frontal cortex to<br>make sense of that information so the<br>only way I come at it with them is it's<br>about your emotion I explain this to<br>young people and they get it and they're<br>so relieved and they go home to their<br>parents hopefully and they tell them I<br>even offered to go with them I'll<br>explain it to you parents yep it's about<br>feelings if what you're doing is a<br>degree feels right that's okay<br>you can't articulate because that's your<br>frontal cortex if you can't articulate<br>it but you feel it's right that's okay<br>if you feel it's wrong that's a problem<br>that line there that's disjointed and<br>the other thing is when you sit in your<br>limbic brain there is no language that's<br>why you get so excited how do you feel<br>ya buddy and ask that guys when you get<br>asked how do you feel you're in your<br>limbic brain if you're in your limbic<br>brain it's hard to have language and<br>describe frontal cortex does that so<br>that's what happens the experience is<br>really important so purpose and passion<br>this is really important this is stuff<br>we should talk to young people about<br>this is where we should go<br>what is purpose it's a generalized<br>intention to accomplish something okay<br>that is meaningful to the self remember<br>the work I do mean something to me it<br>makes sense to me but the other side of<br>it is that I'm doing it first<br>betterment of the world inherently<br>everybody if you think about work work<br>is about being of service to someone<br>else we do lots of things for other<br>people so if you're doing something and<br>it doesn't have to be paid work that<br>make sense to you and you're doing it<br>for someone else that is purpose it's<br>not passion I'm really passionate about<br>sailing my boat<br>that's not for someone else that's for<br>yourself but if you sail your boat and<br>you take people who can't know wouldn't<br>normally do that disadvantaged kids old<br>folk that's more purposeful do you<br>understand the difference going to the<br>beach every week love that that's about<br>doing something for yourself going to<br>the beach every week and cleaning stuff<br>up that's purposeful young people are<br>developing a sense of that where does it<br>come from<br>some young people have trauma early in<br>life eight nine ten the brain changes<br>about eight nine ten you see the world<br>in a different way<br>classic story about the old Pete's<br>dragon you talk about Pete's dragon to<br>an eight nine ten year old and they<br>burst into tears but where's the gone<br>where's he gone five and six-year-old<br>agape all right waiver so the change in<br>the brain at five or six is that you<br>start to see the world in a different<br>way your autobiography memories things<br>that you start to remember have you ever<br>realized why do you remember some things<br>and not others why is it that you<br>remember some things really important<br>things things that affect you because<br>that is where your purpose is coming<br>from things like that so some put young<br>people and I talk to them again where<br>does this come from people who do health<br>doctors when I was about nine young lady<br>when I was about nine I remember being<br>in a ward with my grandmother who was in<br>a lot of pain for two or three days and<br>the nurses really struggled to look<br>after her so what did you do so I made a<br>commitment that I was going to become a<br>nurse where do you think she works and<br>who does she work with old people when I<br>talked to her and I said so that's why<br>you work with old people because of the<br>experience you had with your grandmother<br>how do I know that she's on the right<br>track because she cried she got really<br>upset and tearful yeah couldn't explain<br>it just felt overwhelmed with emotion<br>that's a calling okay you talk to young<br>people who've had trauma in their life<br>sexual abuse domestic abuse cancer<br>accidents those kind of things anybody<br>you see who's old you know in the news<br>usually if they're doing something<br>that's different you they don't ever ask<br>the question do you remember something<br>that happened when you were younger<br>that's the question you need to ask for<br>others it develops okay and it could<br>develop through things like what they're<br>interested in interest is a really<br>interesting area too because we don't<br>know much about the psychology of<br>interest why do you get interested in<br>some things you ever tried to do<br>something on your own usually it's<br>because you have to do things around<br>people people who are really good with<br>their hands and make and do things<br>especially a guy usually there was an<br>uncle or a grandfather or somebody who<br>showed them how to do it interests need<br>to be triggered again and again and<br>again and again it never happens once so<br>it's been sometimes it happens later in<br>life sometimes it happens and sometimes<br>it happens when you don't even know it's<br>happening so if you think about a young<br>person that is really hard for them what<br>are you interested in I don't know and<br>they've got competing interests and when<br>you've got competing interests and your<br>frontal cortex is sort of coming in and<br>out of play it's really hard to settle<br>and say I know what my purpose is that's<br>why as you get older you become more<br>purposeful and actually as you get older<br>you become more resilient so we've got<br>to stop saying too young about young<br>people do they've got no backbone<br>they're not like me no as you get older<br>you get more resilient people in their<br>60s and 70s are more resilient than 30s<br>and 40s and then 20s and 30s there is<br>proof on that okay<br>purposeful people you need to be<br>surrounded by purposeful people you talk<br>to young people is there somebody in<br>your<br>family whose purposeful who is<br>encouraging if they're doing business<br>I can guarantee most times they've got<br>somebody in their family who's a<br>business person they come home they<br>listen to the stories that their parents<br>or whoever that person is who tells them<br>they start to admire them they like what<br>they hear they go this is what I want to<br>do somehow in there they've got to find<br>a sense of why am i doing business how<br>am I going to make a difference and who<br>am I going to make a difference with<br>once they start to think like that great<br>I met a young lady her father was<br>involved in the clothing industry what<br>does she want to do she would love to<br>open her own chain of shops for women<br>and I said why she says because I've<br>worked in shops and when women come in<br>and get the right clothes how they feel<br>is fantastic so do you want to learn how<br>to run businesses that are successful<br>for people like that absolutely that<br>makes sense to me because I want to help<br>those poor people there is some rubbish<br>out there and they feel terrible I want<br>to help women dress better that made<br>sense to her she's doing it for other<br>people that's her purpose it's not for<br>me to judge is for her to try and<br>understand that so what do you look for<br>okay in purpose if you're talking to<br>young people you've actually got a look<br>for continuity and coherence and<br>understanding you've got to try and see<br>if there are patterns and this is really<br>really hard if you're in a parent or if<br>you're interested in this talk to them<br>about early childhood memories why do<br>they remember some things you know 17 18<br>19 year olds month yeah I remember I<br>remember I remember<br>okay so why did I remember those and not<br>the other things what is it about some<br>of those things as some what concerns<br>them in the world if they had a choice<br>that they could change one thing in the<br>world what would you do<br>most of them would maybe stumble and I'm<br>not sure that to me is an indication<br>that yeah they're still not quite there<br>but let's encourage it<br>who are the purposeful people who are<br>the people who surround them that are<br>purposeful what do they talk about role<br>models in particular a role model is the<br>public personification of who you want<br>others to see you as your role models<br>are that's how I want others to look at<br>me that's who your role models are so<br>you think about the people that you<br>admire and think of role models that's<br>how you want others to look at you<br>asking young people that is quite<br>interesting they haven't quite got it<br>yet but they're starting to develop it<br>and more than anything rather than<br>getting some kind of articulated answer<br>you've probably just got a say-so on<br>what feels right if you're doing a law<br>degree does it feel right yeah okay<br>don't ask them what they're going to do<br>with it because they haven't got there<br>yet but if it feels right they're on the<br>way if there's hesitation then sometimes<br>it's somebody else's suggestion that's<br>always a problem in your career as<br>simple question what games did you like<br>playing it's quite interesting you know<br>people who played risk chess that's<br>actually then being very strategic it's<br>quite clear people who do creative games<br>you know they're going to be creative in<br>some way but there is a lot of theory<br>and careers around asking people what<br>games they like playing what are the<br>books and films and TV shows they read<br>and watch quite often they get<br>interested in these because it links to<br>purpose if you've got a teenager what do<br>they keep watch it hopefully it's not my<br>kitchen rules and you know and yellow<br>married at first sight but you know<br>there might be something in that that<br>could be entertainment but there are<br>some things they watch because it's<br>uncovering some kind of purpose you've<br>just got to be aware of those things<br>what are they good at you will invest<br>time effort energy and resources in<br>things that you are good at and<br>interests and you are developing your<br>skills but again that's the middle bit<br>that's how you're going to implement<br>your purpose<br>would you spend a lot of time doing and<br>practicing what feels right in terms of<br>a career just very quickly my daughter<br>my daughter I told her do not her 18 go<br>straight off to tertiary study I said<br>you know this has got to be an<br>investment not a cost and I'm sorry to<br>say but I think a lot of students go to<br>18 and parents will turn around and go<br>yeah they haven't quite figured it out<br>yet but we're hoping in the next couple<br>of years they'll get there oh my god<br>that's an expensive experiment if you<br>ask me I'm not saying don't go off to<br>university or Polytechnic I'm just<br>saying is 18 the right time I'm not so<br>sure for some young people especially if<br>their second third fourth born alright<br>but I asked my daughter she wants to get<br>in the music industry and she wants to<br>put events on where did that come from<br>when she was three she started dancing<br>she's never gonna be a dancer my my<br>little girl alright but she loved the<br>end-of-year show the entertainment<br>factor for the parents she's always<br>enjoyed it then she started playing the<br>piano and was very good at it<br>really good actually but through that<br>she sort of come to the sense that she<br>wants to put music events on why because<br>when she goes to music events it's how<br>it makes her feel and she wants others<br>to feel that at a music event the fact<br>that you lose sense of time and you<br>could do anything you want and you feel<br>great I'm miked up like this I wish I'd<br>been to Robbie Williams last night<br>because I know Robbie would have made me<br>feel like that you know so that's makes<br>sense to her so neuroscience says the<br>brain takes much longer to mature than<br>we first thought the brain is not mature<br>at 18 all right at 12 it's probably the<br>size of an adult brain but the changes<br>that go through could go through to mid<br>20s early 30s could be later there is no<br>consensus on this they're starting to<br>get some clearer idea so we have to take<br>that into account when we come back to<br>things like career decision-making<br>it's got implications on the executive<br>functions planning thinking ahead<br>thinking about what you're thinking<br>about and a young person's ability to<br>make sense their sense of identity<br>who<br>am i it's a very abstract thought and<br>try to put that together it's really<br>hard ask them what the good at and<br>complement if they are I say to my<br>daughter I love the way that you talk to<br>people people come up to you go hey<br>Laura how are you she goes on really<br>well phase how are you I love that<br>so she get engages in a conversation<br>talk to them about the things that<br>they're good at an old boss in mind you<br>say too many people focus too much on<br>the whole and not enough on the doughnut<br>you know we're always being told what<br>we're not good at but what are we good<br>at listen carefully that is important<br>there's a lot of research around that if<br>you do not listen and look away and are<br>distracted that has a real adverse<br>effect on anybody but especially young<br>people they get a sense that you're not<br>interested and you don't care question<br>you might like to ask young people I did<br>this with my daughter as much as your<br>dad what should I do more of as your dad<br>what should I do less of what she said<br>was what you should do more of is give<br>me more money and what you should do<br>less office stop saying now but<br>interestingly some will say stop being<br>on your phone spend more time with me<br>that's really important to young people<br>and talk to them about this stuff in<br>that sense of that sort of sense of<br>purpose there are a group of people and<br>a lot of people who unfortunately have<br>to go to work to survive that is a real<br>interest of mine obviously because of<br>that whole thing around justice if<br>financial pressures get in the way you<br>can forget about purpose it becomes<br>something we're going got time for that<br>I've got to go to work I've got to earn<br>money it's about safety security putting<br>a roof over my head and food on the<br>table and some people when the court in<br>that they never get a that practical<br>sense of developing purpose except that<br>what might happen is their purpose is<br>they go to work to put stuff on the<br>table for their family that's a purpose<br>that's okay all right but financial<br>pressure so for young people and this is<br>what happens they get to the end of<br>their grade their degree<br>if they don't think about purpose and<br>enact it they suddenly get into a job<br>and before they know it they've been in<br>it three years and it's got nothing to<br>do with their degree and they feel lost<br>so it's not those at eighteen that we<br>ought to worry about it's those at 22 23<br>who leave University and then drift<br>they're the ones that I've really<br>worried about because they get into the<br>financial pressures of rent possibly a<br>mortgage family then you that's it<br>twenty years before you come back to<br>that midlife crisis and committing to a<br>stable sense of identity<br>looking back Who am I this is who I am<br>it's a really hard thing to do but if<br>you talk to them about that this is what<br>I think you're good at have used I<br>noticed when what do you think about<br>really good time to talk especially to<br>young people boys take them for a drive<br>because then you're not set like this<br>you'll set like this and I find I love<br>going on road trips with my daughter<br>because she just talks and you get to<br>hear so much and I can ask your stuff<br>and she just gets on so you know pick<br>your time as you guys when you talk to<br>them and what you talk to them about and<br>be encouraging so for your most young<br>people I think this is a great analogy<br>that I come to when they say I've got<br>this degree it does it feel right yes<br>what I can't tell them is that which<br>lane the ring but as long as they're on<br>the right Highway and they're sort of in<br>that arena that's okay<br>they may change lanes the work I do now<br>is a careers adviser is very similar to<br>what I did as a school teacher which is<br>very similar to me helping people find<br>work I can see a connection there I've<br>just changed lanes a few times when<br>people say you know change careers you<br>know that you'll change careers seven<br>times in your life it's absolute rubbish<br>there is no research there is nothing to<br>say where that came from it's an urban<br>myth<br>you may change jobs but I would say that<br>most of you if you change jobs you'll<br>stay on the same highway and underneath<br>it will be the same underlying purpose<br>and what you're hoping to do is when the<br>job you move to becomes more in line<br>with the purpose that you want to follow<br>so if we can help young people<br>understand that then we've got much<br>better chance of getting them into</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
