power of market-shaping.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>market shaping turns traditional<br>strategic thinking on its head<br>so if typical companies try to succeed<br>by analyzing their operating environment<br>and then adjusting their operations<br>accordingly market shapers do the other<br>way around so they try to adjust they<br>don't take the environment as a given<br>but they try to shape the environment so<br>that it creates more value for the<br>company and their customers becoming a<br>market shaper requires a subtle but<br>significant change in how you think so<br>market shapers they understand that the<br>business of business is not just to<br>produce and sell whatever you're selling<br>but the business of business is to<br>create value for your customer and the<br>value for the customer is not only<br>dependent on your product it's also<br>dependent on the system that helps the<br>customer to use the product correctly a<br>classic example of market shaping<br>already comes from the 60s when the<br>predecessor of Rolls Royce understood<br>that you don't necessarily have to sell<br>your jet engines to the airlines that<br>you can also lease them and this small<br>change was quite dramatic because by<br>changing from selling the equipment to<br>leasing the equipment they reduced the<br>capital requirements of the airline's<br>considerably another example which is<br>slightly embarrassing for me as a fin is<br>the smartphone industry and how that<br>developed because as you probably<br>remember Nokia was the biggest mobile<br>phone manufacturer in the early 2000 and<br>they were also the first to introduce<br>their own smart phone but unfortunately<br>poor Nokia didn't really understand what<br>makes the smart phone smart it's not<br>just device it is the apps and Nokia<br>didn't actively foster the creation of<br>app developer ecosystem so that people<br>entrepreneurs could be developing apps<br>to their smartphones Apple on the other<br>hand understood that and now we<br>which of these mobile phone<br>manufacturers ended up being the<br>actually market shaping is not a new<br>phenomenon if you go back 100 and 150<br>years you saw a lot of companies doing<br>very active market shaping and why we<br>saw lots of market shaping strategies<br>100 and 150 years ago was that at that<br>time there was another of technological<br>disruption so invention of electricity<br>and mass production and that opened a<br>lot of opportunities for example for car<br>manufacturers or bicycle manufacturers<br>to do market shaping and now in early<br>2000s we have the digital disruption and<br>it's putting things in motion opening up<br>new opportunities for market shaping and<br>also making things less predictable so<br>it's easier for companies to try to grab<br>back the control by shaping because it's<br>not possible to predict apart from the<br>fact that it allows you to take back<br>control typically the benefits are<br>twofold market shaping makes a bigger<br>pie so almost always market shapers are<br>enjoying faster turnover growth and very<br>often they are more profitable than<br>their competitors that are not involved<br>collaboration is absolutely key to<br>market shaping because if you even just<br>look at the definition you don't have a<br>market level change unless also the<br>other people are changing the way how<br>they are behaving and also very few<br>companies are powerful enough to shape<br>the market alone so one example could be<br>current developments in the electric<br>vehicles markets so you don't just need<br>the electric car you for example also<br>need the charging infrastructure so you<br>need companies who are then developing<br>these batteries and government getting<br>involved so that you get places for the<br>charging stations and so on and so on<br>and there's also a beautiful New Zealand<br>example about the power of collaboration<br>when it comes to market shaping the New<br>Zealand screwcap initiative a small<br>number of New Zealand wineries coming<br>together and making screwcap closure a<br>dominant way of closing a wine bottle<br>globally market shaping is also very<br>important when you're trying to<br>commercialize a very innovative product<br>or completely new technology you<br>probably know a lot of stories about<br>products that fail that we're just ahead<br>of their time and timing is one aspect<br>of ads so if we take an example from<br>Apple and the introduction of iPod Apple<br>realise that it pays wait until for<br>example the entrant air internet speed<br>is sufficiently high for people to<br>download music but they also understood<br>the system that the consumers need in<br>order to get value from their player<br>it's not just a player the consumers<br>also need music and preferably in an<br>easy and legal way and then they<br>introduced the I choose that was the<br>game changer move in this particular<br>market<br>there are a lot of wonderful examples of<br>qiba companies shaping their markets<br>very very successfully but unfortunately<br>we are not seeing that as much as we do<br>in other countries of similar size<br>according to our research it's a bit of<br>an oxymoron so New Zealand companies are<br>punching way beyond their weight when it<br>comes to the antecedents of market<br>shaping so they truly understand value<br>creation and the systemic nature of<br>their markets but for some reason they<br>are not proactively shaping their<br>markets but in my book that is actually<br>good news because changing culture would<br>be much more difficult than than just<br>taking this new strategic toolbox so<br>there are lots of untapped opportunities<br>for New Zealand companies in summary New<br>Zealand produces wonderful products<br>wonderful services but what is needed<br>what is the magic ingredient is to<br>become more courageous start proactively<br>shaping markets also internationally and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
