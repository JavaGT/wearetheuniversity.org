This works!</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>when we started this program nobody was<br>sure that it would succeed we didn't<br>even know if students would be keen to<br>come but we since the start have really<br>been inundated by student interest they<br>have really grabbed hold of us that the<br>edge b-squared told about the small<br>sites that we've talked about it grabbed<br>hold of this opportunity and everyone's<br>put in a tremendous amount of effort<br>we've expanded the program in Northland<br>initially we only had five students now<br>we've got yes six students and they<br>spending the entire here as well and<br>we're increasing the number so we're<br>gonna have a cohort of 44 students<br>spending their entire year in Northland<br>as of 2019<br>Fukuoka is really important for<br>Northland but it's also important for<br>the medical school in general it was the<br>pilot program if you like and now we've<br>got programs in Taranaki and in fact<br>and I think it's important because<br>students need to know the different type<br>of medicine that's practiced in the<br>rural areas the different connection<br>that you have with the communities and<br>the different experiences I think to<br>become an all-around student if you have<br>a full basket of information you're able<br>to be more proactive in the way you<br>address your clients so that's the hope<br>is that the little strains of<br>information we go they're supportive to<br>their journey working with the community<br>it's amazing how you can get integrated<br>into a community by just being here by<br>meeting patients by talking to them<br>about their stories comparing<br>contrasting the amount of times that I<br>have been suggested to go to a place for<br>dinner or go visit that Beach on your<br>way you know you're doing a consultation<br>with someone that's really sick and they<br>still tell you where they'd be scallops<br>modest and I think those they're just<br>they're like little gems that you get<br>from talking to people living with all<br>the other students it's very different<br>to any other experience such as that you<br>have in med school really like because<br>you're there 24/7 so you you get the<br>bounce ideas off each other or study<br>together or whatever and I just get like<br>a lot of the social stuff outside of<br>work you get to spend a lot of time<br>together doing it in the beaches body<br>whatever going away on trips and yet<br>just Condorcet job gives you like real<br>real good mates to go through the risky<br>and mid school with and then the rest of<br>your careers with this year 2017 we<br>expanded a similar program in the Bay of<br>Plenty involving Fayette Anya<br>and next year 2018 we're going to have a<br>program running out of horror and New<br>Plymouth and so we've got great support<br>Montana monkey District Health Board to<br>start that program so we spread<br>throughout the upper North Island in<br>regional and rural settings because we<br>really believe in the mission of<br>providing doctors for all of New Zealand<br>not just opened you see the most amazing<br>pathology in small towns if you're<br>really science and medical driven the<br>stuff that we see in the stuff that we<br>deal with as such a ridiculous contrast<br>to what we have in Auckland I've had<br>people that have left for a day who were<br>doing 10 times more more at a more<br>junior role than they are now in a more<br>senior role so the experience the<br>responsibility the confidence you get<br>with the job is amazing it's wrong in<br>the deep end if you want to challenge<br>you do it and everyone's grateful for<br>what you do up here which is really cool<br>great job satisfaction we're in it for<br>the long game because the big goal here<br>is that the students who spend time here<br>will ultimately come back and work here<br>and specialize here and build their<br>families and fauna here I can definitely<br>see myself having a future one day me<br>and my partner just bought a house and<br>finally we've set some roots down I have<br>so many friends here from a completely<br>completely different life paths<br>our main aim is to come back we know<br>that we're gonna have to leave for a<br>while for specialty training and that's<br>just life it's how medical training<br>heavens and but we'll hang on to the<br>house hopefully come back and have kids<br>here and have a family and that's a big<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
