Gemma receives $22,000 to assist her research into the use of infrared thermography (IRT) for the early disease detection of neonatal calf diarrhoea (NCD). <br><br>Gemma has always had a strong interest in animal welfare and we chat to her about her research and how it can help the future of farming.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my PhD research is focused on looking at<br>behavioral and physiological changes<br>which occur in response to the onset of<br>neonatal cafeteria and New Zealand dairy<br>calves<br>we're looking at different measures such<br>as feeding behavior drinking behavior<br>respiration rate and lying behavior and<br>looking at how those change response to<br>the onset of MCD and in addition to that<br>one of the main focuses is looking at<br>using and Fred thermography which is a<br>measure of the amount of radiated heat<br>and animals giving off and relating that<br>and seeing how that changes in response<br>to neonatal calf diarrhea as well so<br>we've been freed from ography we have<br>done a trial whereby we went around<br>manually and took images of five<br>different locations on the calves body<br>and so we're looking at changes across<br>those areas and seeing how those change<br>in response to disease and we're also<br>overall looking to develop an automated<br>system which we can integrate that<br>inference<br>tomography into there's the cast feeds<br>from the feeder triggers the camera to<br>collect images and then we're able to go<br>through using an algorithm and use it to<br>detect the onset of MCD so farmers it'll<br>mean that they're able to treat the sick<br>animals sooner and also keep them<br>isolated to prevent the spread of<br>disease neonatal care area is a main<br>health issue affecting cows in New<br>Zealand at the moment and so having the<br>ability to try to something to try and<br>minimize that impact that disease is<br>having is what kind of drove me to want<br>to do this research I applied for the<br>scholarship because when I looked on the<br>field days website and saw that the<br>mission was to advance agriculture<br>through things like innovate and then<br>technology I kind of thought that it was<br>a good fit with my research I see my PhD<br>taking me hopefully to a position as a<br>animal welfare scientist hopefully<br>developing innovative technologies that<br>can be applied on farm to the benefit of<br>farmers</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
