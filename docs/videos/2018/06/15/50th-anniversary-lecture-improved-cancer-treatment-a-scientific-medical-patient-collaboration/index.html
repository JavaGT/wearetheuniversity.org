Mike Finland the professor of<br>oncology and on behalf of John Luther<br>CEO of the cancer sorry Auckland and<br>Northland I'd like you to but to welcome<br>you to this evening sir lectures I'm<br>sure you'll find the most entertaining<br>and informing we we have a couple of<br>housekeeping rules one as I've lift my<br>mobile phone out to remind me to remind<br>you to switch your mobile phone on to<br>silent so you can see I've done mine and<br>the second is that if there's an<br>emergency there are exits to use if one<br>needs the bathroom the bathrooms are up<br>outside the lecture theatre and so with<br>that done I'd like to firstly introduced<br>the the director sue Brewster executive<br>director of the opened Medical Research<br>Foundation along with the Cancer Society<br>of Auckland and Northland and medical<br>Health Sciences the co-sponsors of this<br>session so sir would you like to come<br>forward thank you very much and what a<br>fantastic turnout there is here tonight<br>even on a rainy night we couldn't put<br>anyone off and it's just wonderful to<br>see you all here so thank you very much<br>it's a real pleasure to be partnering<br>with the Faculty of medical and Health<br>Sciences and the Cancer Society for this<br>particular lecture and in celebration of<br>the 50th anniversary so look I don't<br>think these I'm just going to do the<br>buttons I don't think there's too much<br>that I can actually say about funding<br>research into cancer treatments because<br>I think this young lady key Rihanna's<br>story will really say at all so in March<br>2015<br>kiri Anna Elliot woke up with a bit of a<br>sore ankle feeling a bit tired not a<br>usual buzzy self and in one month later<br>she was diagnosed<br>with leukemia key Rihanna's mum Ashla<br>described that day as the worst day in<br>the family's lives but the good news is<br>that prior to Carrie Ana's diagnosis dr.<br>Andrew wood a pediatrician specializing<br>in child blood cancers was awarded our<br>a.m. our if Douglas Goodfellow<br>repatriation fellowship and we brought<br>him back from Philadelphia where he was<br>working<br>this funding allowed dr. wood to return<br>home and advance his research and to<br>childhood leukemia and he also was Kari<br>Anna's specialist caring for her journey<br>cancer care and her treatments so then<br>we fast forward to May 2017 and carry on<br>as treatments had all finished and she<br>was allowed to return home to her family<br>tonight I'm so delighted to say that<br>kiriona is in full remission she's back<br>to playing hockey and netball and doing<br>dancing that she absolutely loves and of<br>course Karianna and her family are so<br>grateful to dr. wood and his team for<br>the extraordinary care that they<br>received during that journey but I think<br>the big thing they also acknowledge is<br>that without funding and to research for<br>the cancer treatments Karianna Zac<br>outcomes could have been very very<br>different so I'd like to finish by<br>thanking our credible presenters who are<br>here tonight and presenting on behalf of<br>our research community who are all<br>working to provide advancement in<br>medicine and health but most of all I'd<br>like to thank our supporters who are<br>here tonight because without your<br>support a bright and healthy future for<br>children like Karianna just wouldn't be<br>possible<br>so look thank you very much thank you<br>everyone for coming and please you've<br>got feedback forms like these and your<br>folders or you can receive them on the<br>way on the door please do take two<br>minutes to fill them out they're really<br>important so we can keep providing these<br>lectures for you thank you very much and<br>enjoy<br>you're a tato good evening everyone<br>it's my great pleasure to introduce a<br>man who I'm sure to many of you doesn't<br>actually need much of an introduction<br>its distinguished professor bill Denny<br>and bill has had a stellar career in New<br>Zealand and overseas in terms of cancer<br>research originally trained here at<br>Auckland University and then Oxford<br>University bill has had a string of<br>achievement and we'd be here for the<br>next era if I was to ring them read them<br>all out but I think the most perhaps the<br>ones recognition that I really want to<br>make is either Rutherford medallist of<br>the Royal Society of New Zealand and<br>Adrian Albert medalist of the UK Royal<br>Society and an officer of the New<br>Zealand Order of Merit for services to<br>cancer research bill is the current<br>director of the orphan cancer society<br>research centre and please welcome<br>building<br>thank you very much John and welcome<br>everyone here it's really good to see so<br>many people here on this ice a wet night<br>what I'd like to do is to talk briefly<br>about the work we're doing in the Cancer<br>Center to develop new drugs for cancer<br>therapy now drug development is a very<br>multidisciplinary exercise you need<br>first of all the computer modelers to<br>try to design the targets you want a hit<br>you need the chemists obviously to<br>design and make the drugs that you want<br>those to be those tags to hit with you<br>need the biologists pharmacologists<br>potential conditions to take those drugs<br>further into their development and the<br>work in the lab is enabled by<br>collaborations outside with other<br>scientists and clinicians and with<br>outside companies as well because it's a<br>very expensive journey outside the lab<br>as well to get a drug through into<br>clinical trial and we've done this with<br>a number of large commercial companies<br>with a number of small companies and<br>even there on the bottom here are some<br>of our own venture capital startup<br>companies and with these partners force<br>interested to date taken 12 new cancer<br>drugs into clinical trials some in New<br>Zealand and the rivers around the world<br>now the early drugs that we use for<br>cancer targeted DNA and that was logical<br>because its DNA its errors in the DNA<br>that caused the errors in the proteins<br>which caused cells to become cancerous<br>but unfortunately at that time we didn't<br>know enough to be able to target the<br>subtle differences in the sequence of<br>DNA that really the mutations were all<br>about and in seed these drugs like the<br>intercalators just broke the DNA strands<br>and the drugs like the alkyl aiders<br>linked the two strands together and both<br>of those things means we still can't<br>divide the cell dies and these cells<br>have these drugs are very effective at<br>killing cancer cells they're relatively<br>unselective at killing normal cells as<br>well so they have toxicities associated<br>with<br>but what we understand today is the<br>staggering complexity of a human cell<br>and the proteins in silent each of you<br>is made up of about 10 trillion cells so<br>they're all very small but even so each<br>cell packs into it more than 10,000<br>different proteins a lot of these<br>proteins are linked and hooked up into<br>signaling networks here which exchange<br>signals among each other and signals<br>from the outside but control when a cell<br>divides and when it doesn't a lot of<br>them act essentially as switches to turn<br>things on and off and each of those<br>individual proteins are made up of<br>thousands of different atoms so that<br>each struck the pro' each protein has a<br>very specific structure and it's only<br>when we can get down into the atomic<br>level and look at these at the level of<br>each atom that we see the unique<br>differences between them and can start<br>designing compounds that target one<br>protein among the 50 to 10,000 or so so<br>what I'd like to do today is to talk<br>very briefly about three types of<br>projects in the center one of them is<br>drugs to control these signaling enzymes<br>and you can see here a small heart EGF<br>receptor enzyme and each of these little<br>green bumps is a single atom so you can<br>see now that at that level we can see<br>this big get this big hole in the in the<br>protein and we can learn how to design<br>drugs to bind into that hole I've also<br>talked briefly about two other projects<br>one a long-standing project is drugs<br>targeting the hypoxic cells that are<br>specific to Kansas because they exist a<br>long way from the blood stream and they<br>lack oxygen and finally a little bit<br>about the way we're now finally starting<br>to approach the even more complex immune<br>system to talk about drugs which can<br>boost the immune systems capability but<br>coming back to the first point the EGF<br>receptor is one of these switch proteins<br>it happens for suit<br>in the membrane across the membrane and<br>it takes signals from outside transmits<br>them through into the inside and the<br>seats of the axes are switched to tell<br>cells whether to turn on or turn off and<br>of course some of the problems is that<br>mutations causes these enzymes to be<br>stuck in the old position we're<br>continually dividing now you can see<br>here that by use of this Maltese<br>modelling techniques we can in fact<br>designed drugs that fit very tightly and<br>very neatly into this pocket that's been<br>provided in the enzyme and shut it off<br>from functioning but the trouble with<br>this visited this these drugs binds<br>reversibly they come in they bind they<br>leave the game and the enzyme that's<br>only blocked hated when it's large when<br>there's high amounts of drug in in the<br>system but a severe drug gets<br>metabolized the drugs can move out again<br>and the the period of shutdown is<br>relatively smaller than we would like so<br>our particular contribution to this area<br>has been to note that these drugs bind<br>in this pocket in the same way each time<br>and therefore we can use that general<br>binding to deliver a fairly reactive<br>unit on the drug to a reactive unit on<br>the protein and separately those two<br>things are not very reactive but bring<br>them close together and they link to<br>form a permanent bond so those drugs<br>have been irreversibly bound and the<br>cancer is the enzyme is shut down<br>permanently<br>and can insulin from our collaboration<br>with Pfizer was the first of these<br>irreversible inhibitors to reach human<br>trials a few years back and we've and we<br>used on at a particular locking unit<br>called in the column I'm and to date<br>there at lau about ten of these<br>irreversible inhibitors in clinical use<br>targeting different enzymes and<br>therefore being of different structure<br>and generators through many different<br>companies but all of them use the<br>original locking in it that we<br>the secondary I would like to talk about<br>briefly is just selectively targeting<br>the so called hypoxic or low oxygen<br>cells that exist in the center of solid<br>tumors this is a cross-section through a<br>solid tumor and you can see here the<br>blood vessels here you can see in the<br>red and black the oxygen oxygenated<br>cells close to the blood vessels still<br>fully dividing and far away from the<br>blood vessels in the green you see the<br>hypoxic self had a viable but shut down<br>and not cycling and these are really<br>unique to cancer tissue so there's a<br>difference can we exploit that<br>difference because these hypoxic cells<br>are difficult to kill with conventional<br>drugs because they're remote from the<br>blood vessels it shut down they're not<br>replicating so most of the standard<br>drugs don't work but if you do treat<br>these tumors with normal drugs and you<br>cut out all the oxygen of the cells then<br>oxygen is free to flow again and turn<br>these cells back on to regenerate the<br>tumor and that's what happens in so many<br>cases so we've been looking at what we<br>call hypoxia activated Pro drugs which<br>contain an oxygen sensor linked through<br>to an inactive form of the drug and<br>these are designed to be fairly stable<br>safe and non-toxic until they distribute<br>through into these hypoxic regions when<br>this face recognizes the lack of oxygen<br>and then starts the process that results<br>in fragmentation of the drug to release<br>the active form and ideally then this<br>active form will redistribute to kill<br>some of the officers maybe cancer cells<br>as well we currently have three drugs<br>now have reached clinical trial in Syria<br>PA 104<br>italics not a noob and a drug called cpt<br>row six and you can see from this<br>example of Telex not a new treating a<br>animal model of a solid tumor before<br>treatment you can image the hypoxic<br>cells in green but after treatment with<br>the drug those have all gone away<br>they've all been taken out so these<br>things do work in these models<br>and we're hopeful that we'll get<br>successful clinical trials was one of<br>these contents in the near future<br>and finally the immune system until<br>recently was so complicated that we<br>couldn't even contemplate how we could<br>affect that how we could help that to<br>its job is to seek out and destroy<br>foreign cells so it's our frontline<br>defense against cancers but cancers have<br>many ways in which they can first of all<br>block the processes by which the immune<br>cells take out chances and secondly<br>simply weakened the immune response<br>generally and the project in the center<br>here targeted at the second point is<br>looking at another protein called CSF<br>one receptor which is secreted by<br>cancers and instead of doing it can<br>recruit the patient's own immune cells<br>the macrophages to start generating<br>growth factors which cause the cells to<br>be stimulated and to grow so that if<br>effect it's subverts the immune systems<br>response and by shutting this down we<br>can stop this process and so we've been<br>again in the early state there's there's<br>so far only two drugs in the clinic<br>targeting the scenes I'm it's early days<br>but we have a program running for the<br>last couple of years looking at modeling<br>the pockets in this enzyme where we can<br>bind drugs to and now have a series of<br>selective and very potent compounds that<br>we're trying to evolve through into<br>fighting a clinical candidate in the<br>next couple of years but the question<br>that we can pose is how what's the value<br>of all this research what sort of impact<br>is it making intensive treatment when<br>you get out of the lab and one of the<br>best ways we could perhaps talk about<br>that with a single number is looking at<br>the percentage of patients in New<br>Zealand who survived for ten years or<br>and you can see that through a<br>combination of better lifestyles better<br>screening because early screening is<br>important and better treatment and that<br>includes better surgery radiotherapy and<br>not least the whole pile of new drugs<br>that have been coming through and for<br>the last many years the 10-year plus<br>year survival rate has improved from<br>less than a quarter of all people when<br>when I started work actually through to<br>about nearly 60% now and that's a real<br>improvement but of course it begs the<br>immediate question how can we make that<br>better how can we continue this<br>improvement and I think just to finish<br>off there were three areas which I think<br>are going to bear on that in the near<br>future<br>first of all earlier and more accurate<br>screening because if we can identify<br>chances early we can treat them more<br>effectively and being able to identify<br>the tiny amounts of tumor DNA that's<br>released by dying tumor cells into the<br>bloodstream at an early stage will allow<br>us to have simply detect that DNA<br>through blood tests and that will<br>obviously be very much cheaper very much<br>more simpler than what we have to go<br>through now now this technology is not<br>quite there yet but there's an awful lot<br>of work going on around the world and<br>I'm fairly confident that in the next<br>few years we'll be able to see<br>increasingly our ability to identify<br>chima DNA from blood samples secondly<br>better matching of patients and drugs<br>the way in which a patient responds to a<br>drug depends on the genetics of that<br>tumor and the genetics of the patient<br>and in any particular tumor treating a<br>group of people with the same type of<br>cancer you'll get some people that are<br>not that where the drug is not effective<br>and we really don't want to be treating<br>those people with that drug so based on<br>humor and pasting genetics with a<br>matching of patients to drugs in a<br>personalized approach is coming along<br>very rapidly and I think we'll hear a<br>bit more about that<br>and finally there is a whole slew of new<br>trucks coming through and particularly<br>the immunotherapy drugs and these are<br>increasingly based on individual patient<br>genetics and I think those three areas<br>where we are seeing big progress going<br>on in the science will feed through to<br>treatment in the next few years so I've<br>very briefly I'm afraid discussed a few<br>of the cancer drug development programs<br>going on in the center and of course I<br>remind you that across the faculty<br>there's a very large research effort<br>into all areas all aspects of cancer<br>diagnosis treatment and therapy and<br>support and thank you very much for your<br>attention<br>thank you very much bill before we run<br>away we have a format where this time we<br>have time for one question from the<br>audience stand a bit I've got a question<br>bill what's the biggest challenge of the<br>year in your discipline of medicinal<br>chemistry for the next 10 years keeping<br>up with the flood of data that's coming<br>through from everybody else you can<br>actually do something that's different<br>to what everyone else is doing with the<br>kinase inhibitors I talked about we were<br>the first to do a certain thing let's<br>follow through with everyone else the<br>hypoxia programs we've been running for<br>a long time none of those are yet<br>successful but we finally know I think<br>all of the things we need to know and<br>the next compound a couple of compounds<br>to come through from the lab have a much<br>better chance of actually giving getting<br>approved it's exciting work I'd like to<br>move on and introduce our next speaker<br>who's professor Li Ming Ching who is at<br>the Auckland study research center as<br>well she's been well trained here but<br>the stromal targeting group at the<br>center specializing approaches to<br>restore the capacity of the normal cells<br>in the tumor system to fight cancer<br>thank you and thank you everyone for<br>coming yes so I work at at the Oakland<br>Cancer Society Research Center which is<br>a just over the next to the toilets and<br>you're welcome to come visit us now what<br>I want to do in my talk is to expand<br>upon some of the advances and approaches<br>that harness the immune system to kill<br>the cancer now now we all everybody here<br>has a functioning immune system that we<br>use toward of infections<br>from bugs and bacteria and viruses as<br>well as mutated cancer cells and by far<br>the most effective way arm of the immune<br>system that can seek out and destroy the<br>cancer cells are what we call the color<br>t-cells now below before and after shot<br>of a melanoma cells have been killed by<br>these white cells which are the immune<br>t-cells now when the immune t-cells<br>spots a melanoma cell that rolls towards<br>hurt sniff around and when they decide<br>that yes indeed that's a nasty cell that<br>we wish to get rid of they release a<br>product called a protein called perforin<br>onto the surface and that serves to<br>punch these great big holes that you<br>might be able to pick out here and then<br>the cancer cell just releases all its<br>blood and guts land and dies and then<br>the t-cells just go off and finds other<br>cancer cells to kill so they're serial<br>killers and we've known about these<br>killer T cells since the 1960s and since<br>the 1990s we've been madly trying to<br>harness them for use as therapy but it's<br>only recently that with all the new<br>latest technologies and our ability to<br>separate these out from the blood of<br>patients and to be able to grow them<br>outside the body in incubators in Deer I<br>say a giant plastic bag so we use only<br>once and toss but none have been found<br>in the belly of whales and sea turtles<br>and those sales we have us will then put<br>back to the patient in a process called<br>adoptive t-cell transfer and in December<br>to zero thirteen science one of our<br>top-rated scientific journals claimed it<br>as the breakthrough of the year but very<br>soon after that scientists took these<br>endogenous natural T cells and they<br>added but some pieces tore to make a<br>better and those are called chimeric<br>antigen receptor or car T cells now if I<br>would start likin these two different<br>types of cells two models of cars then<br>these are your Toyota Corollas very<br>reliable very dependable and will get<br>you to work no trouble but these car T<br>cells are you mercedes-benz us they<br>don't get you to work any faster but do<br>you enjoy the two-hour certain rush-hour<br>traffic<br>much more now the results from recent<br>clinical trials of car t cells through<br>leukemia have come up with statements<br>such as those patients had eight pounds<br>of leukemia that just melted away now<br>you can tell them and must have come<br>from a american trial because the rest<br>of the world have used her moved on to<br>metrics but there's so many pounds and<br>ounces now to put the sake counts of<br>leukemia to some perspective eight<br>pounds converts to about 3.6 kilos and<br>the average weight of a leukemia cell is<br>about two nano grams so if you do the<br>calculations that converts to two<br>million million leukemia cell set up and<br>count so if I told you that these normal<br>natural T cells are serial killers these<br>car T cells are your weapons of mass<br>destruction<br>now unfortunately Auckland doesn't have<br>a factory for making Carty sales but I<br>think it would be I think it would be<br>needed we could raise the funding<br>somehow to produce car t-cells and these<br>weapons of mass destruction in our local<br>war against cancer now T cells B at the<br>souped-up car T cells or the normal<br>natural T cells when they get tired from<br>killing they express brakes are on this<br>surface now scientists have made<br>antibodies to those brakes which covers<br>up the immune checkpoint blockade the<br>immune checkpoints which is the more<br>scientific term for the brakes and they<br>prevent the cells from being they block<br>the brakes from being applied and the<br>poor are t-cells have to continued to<br>curl on and on and on and keep on going<br>no matter how tight and how much it<br>wants to retire now initially these<br>antibodies the immune checkpoint<br>blockades were made so the scientists<br>could understand use it as tools to<br>understand how t-cells were regulated<br>but when they were child as a therapy in<br>its own right the results were<br>absolutely spectacular and the T saw has<br>lots of immune checkpoints but the first<br>ones to be trialed were the anti ctla-4<br>antibodies the palamoun map and tremor<br>tremor and the second a lot with the<br>anti pd-1 antibodies they were trout<br>firstly and against avance malignant<br>melanoma patients who have failed all<br>previous therapies and were expected to<br>live only a few more months but on<br>epilim a the p for short the immune<br>checkpoint<br>a therapy was found to induce durable<br>responses and some of the patients has<br>now been over 15 years that they have<br>been alive and this led to oncologist<br>thing it's not unconceivable the<br>patient's may live virtually<br>disease-free for years using approaches<br>that harness the immune system so let's<br>have a closer look at the data and this<br>is epi on a group of 4846 melanoma<br>patients and you can see that there is a<br>drop-off but if you're alive after three<br>years on a payee then you're expected<br>that you will survive up to well past<br>ten years and so that is wonderful and<br>much much better than the current chemo<br>therapies where it just drops off within<br>a year but and in this group of nearly<br>5,000 patients we have saved about a<br>thousand but they're still the other<br>four thousand that the P could not save<br>and so the big question is and the big<br>challenges how do we try and bring that<br>tau through the up there are two<br>approaches currently one is to use the<br>genetic the tools of precision medicine<br>and in sequence the genome of the<br>patients who have responded well and try<br>and identify why they are better<br>responders and the other way is to use<br>combination therapy if one immune<br>checkpoint blockade or give you that<br>many cures then let's add more and more<br>and both approaches have provided<br>positive results because we now know<br>that the<br>that the tumors that respond well they<br>have a higher to mutation burden than<br>the ones which are responding pure badly<br>that's because these are defect in the<br>gene that corrects for all the mutations<br>and in combination therapy where you add<br>more and more give more than one immune<br>chip not blockade yes you can get you<br>can push the natal up this is a P and<br>you can get twenty two percent which are<br>a live long long term and this is the<br>response from Nivola map nivo for short<br>that will give you 48 percent of the<br>patients getting durable responses but<br>the combination of the two is greater<br>than the sum of a forty eight and twenty<br>two percent so it's an adjuster now so<br>why aren't we doing more and more<br>combinations well these are moonship<br>bond blockades come worth the price they<br>have a lot of bad toxicities associated<br>with it with a P for a 22 percent<br>long-term survival it comes with 23<br>percent of the patients getting bad<br>adverse effects nivo is a better drug it<br>gives you 48 percent long-term survivors<br>with only a 16 point three percent of<br>adverse toxicities the combination<br>unfortunately the toxicities seemed to<br>be also synergistic so and some of these<br>toxicities are so debilitating the<br>patients choose to come off at so can we<br>find combination<br>where you can get better responses that<br>not the toxicities now maybe this is a<br>reap lot of the graphs that that I<br>showed you and it's called a waterfall<br>plot and as of and this is of nivo and<br>epi against the melanoma of patients and<br>you can see not all of them that the<br>tumor shrinks but the majority does and<br>here are the ones where all the tumor<br>has gone and as I said this combination<br>is you have 55% of your patients<br>suffering three and grade three and four<br>adverse events now if we showed there's<br>the waterfall plot from nivo same as<br>that one plus another drug will you poke<br>a dose<br>you pack a dose that I don't make up<br>these names and I don't know who does<br>again they were 19 they were Misha<br>static melanoma patients that were not<br>expected to survive from for long<br>periods but here they were getting very<br>good responses similar to us and these<br>have old disappeared but look at a<br>percentage of toxicities 11% compared<br>so the poker Doster belongs to a new<br>class of drugs that are called ido1<br>inhibitors would people like to hear<br>more about these good thank goodness for<br>that because I spent the last 10 years<br>of my life working on this now I do one<br>is an enzyme that converts tryptophan to<br>Kyra named tryptophan is an essential<br>amino acid that cells require in order<br>to make proteins now it's been shown<br>that many cancer cells Express I do one<br>which are seller rates conversion of<br>tryptophan to KO uranium and perhaps<br>either the decrease in tryptophan<br>concentrations or the increase and<br>Quarantine and downstream toxic<br>metabolites results and suppression of<br>their cancer killing t-cells and it's<br>been shown that many cancers Express<br>idea as a way of suppressing the immune<br>system and patients whose tumors are<br>expressing a lot of idea 1 have a poorer<br>survival or poorer prognosis so it's a<br>no brainer really that a we that we<br>should try and develop drugs that block<br>this enzyme and then we could use it to<br>restore the activity of the immune cells<br>that kill the cancer and we and many<br>other groups have been trying to sort of<br>do that now so next door next to the<br>toilets I had a team we developed essays<br>that allow a team of students to sift<br>through as many compounds as they could<br>to look for I do inhibitors and we<br>actually went through over 14,000 and we<br>got a quite a few 228 but not every<br>single compound<br>can't be converted or is suitable for<br>conversion or use as a pharmaceutical we<br>needed compounds that could get into<br>cells because I do is an intracellular<br>protein we also did not want the<br>compound to be cytotoxic and kill off<br>the immune cells or other normal cells<br>we wanted the compounds to have good<br>metabolic stability so it's not<br>converted quickly to a useless compound<br>as soon as you give it to patients and<br>we certainly want at once well you could<br>give as a pill because it's so much more<br>convenient and asking your patients to<br>come in for intravenous infusions and<br>once we'd sort of put all the compounds<br>through all these tiers we ended up with<br>about three and but the most promising<br>ones has been licensed to a<br>biopharmaceutical company who will have<br>who will help us take it through into<br>clinical trials now in April 6 2 0 15<br>Nature Biotechnology had an editorial<br>saying that I do and habit earth moves<br>center stage in immuno oncology and<br>chemical in the engineering news at the<br>front at the cover on I do inhibitors<br>unleashing the immune system to combat<br>cancer now I'd love to be able to sort<br>of say that this happened because of the<br>wonderful work we were doing but<br>unfortunately no that was when these two<br>companies they started two years after<br>us but would be a bigger deeper pockets<br>and a bigger staff got the I do and her<br>betters interface one Charles much<br>earlier and very soon after their the<br>big guns bristol-myers Squibb advisor at<br>their ideas and<br>face 1 clinical trials No<br>3 years later it's not to 0 18 where are<br>we where are they<br>well new links turn n hooks was the<br>first one to withdraw and we weren't we<br>still don't know whether it was because<br>the idea inhibitor didn't work or<br>genetics immune checkpoint blockade<br>which was untested at that time didn't<br>work but we weren't worried because he<br>polka-dots dad was borrowing long and<br>was in phase 2 and getting good good<br>results but then early this year<br>Pfizer stopped recruiting patients with<br>brain cancer for use with their idea<br>inhibitors they had only recruited 19<br>and decided to stop which I thought was<br>rather strange because normally one<br>doesn't expect much in face one Charles<br>with the mono therapy but it didn't but<br>if poker dos debt was still bearing long<br>and this time in phase 3 child's in<br>combination with Mertz anti pd-1 but<br>when in April to 0 18 they announced<br>murk announced that they were no longer<br>continuing to go ahead with insights<br>idea 1 inhibitor it did put everybody in<br>their bed of Aspen became very sooner<br>after bristol-myers Squibb just a couple<br>of weeks I have two words decided that<br>they would stop recruiting on for their<br>phase 3 trials of their in-house I do<br>one inhibitor in their in-house immune<br>bristol-myers Squibb had just recruited<br>72 of the 700 our patients that were<br>hoping to put our onto the face three<br>trials but both bristol-myers Squibb and<br>insight are not saying they're just<br>taking a breather so they can sort of go<br>back and analyze all the subsets and<br>they're faced two trials which were had<br>very good results and they just want to<br>analyze the patients that did respond so<br>they could find the markers of selecting<br>ones that will respond versus those that<br>don't and make sure that going forward<br>they recruit the ones that will respond<br>we at the same time have also put the<br>trials of our I do and of the inhibitor<br>on hold and at the moment we're back<br>into the lab trying to understand more<br>about the relationship of I do one and T<br>do because the body has two enzymes to<br>do the same pathway of converting<br>tryptophan to cane urine and we had<br>preclinical data that suggested that<br>when we in used idea one inhibitors to<br>well the increase in tryptophan sent a<br>feedback message to the liver which is<br>expresses the T do and it's T do who's<br>not who's responsible for the normal<br>homeostasis of tryptophan in the blood<br>and circulation and so when the liver<br>gets the message to increase the I do<br>activity then it converts tryptophan<br>takamura knee and just counter<br>counteracts the effect of the I do<br>inhibitors that we want to reverse to<br>restore to anti-tumor immunity and if<br>this is what's happening then I do<br>inhibitors on the gyro may not be<br>effective and you need to sort of<br>perhaps be giving an inhibitor of T do<br>at the same time and it just so happens<br>we we have in the lab some lovely I do<br>selective and dual inhibitors of I do<br>and T do and of our depending on the<br>results of our current laboratory<br>studies we caught the ACS I see could be<br>in a very good position to be one of the<br>first groups to put T do an appetizer<br>and into clinical trials now am I out of<br>time<br>today well<br>I did want to thank everybody and my<br>funders the Cancer CC santan a MRF and<br>since they get their funding from the<br>generosity of the public Oakland public<br>thank you for your generosity and<br>donations<br>thank you very much slamming um when we<br>were planning this evening we were very<br>conscious that it is a winter's night<br>and we didn't want to keep you all too<br>long so we are sticking very much to the<br>timetable but I'm assured that our<br>speakers will be around at the end of<br>the event so if you do have some<br>questions I'm sure there'll be an<br>opportunity to to connect up with one of<br>the speakers after the event so so<br>moving right along next up we have<br>Professor Kristen print who's going to<br>be talking about genomics for cancer<br>patients Chris graduated in medicine<br>from the University of Auckland and then<br>worked as a house surgeon in Dunedin<br>before completing in in immunology PhD<br>in Auckland Chris now leads the genomics<br>into medicine program at Auckland<br>University<br>he's currently professor of the<br>university's department of molecular<br>medicine and pathology and a principal<br>investigator in the Morris Wilkin Center<br>and I think still very much<br>demonstrating his connection with<br>clinical practice he's the immediate<br>past president of the New Zealand<br>Society of oncology so without further<br>ado welcome<br>thank you very much for the kind<br>introduction and thank you for coming<br>out on such a wet night my talks going<br>to be much shorter than li-ming's<br>because it's a area that is very<br>difficult to explain easily because it<br>is based in technology so I'll have a<br>shot though so what I'd like to do is<br>break my talk into three areas first of<br>all I want to introduce what genomics is<br>and how this disruptive technology of<br>genomics is really transforming our<br>understanding of cancer and moving into<br>transforming patient care then after<br>that I'm going to talk about genomics as<br>a way to transform what we can<br>understand about the complexity of<br>tumors and how it's really telling us<br>how little we actually know just when we<br>think we know everything where you get<br>knocked off our feet and then finally I<br>want to talk about the implications for<br>New Zealand patients people with cancer<br>in New Zealand from genomics so genomics<br>is a truly disruptive technology it's<br>the study of genes and genomes all of<br>your 21,000 genes and the myriad of<br>proteins they make how does all of this<br>integrate together to make the signaling<br>pathways and cells that buildi me and<br>blaming Cheng showed you the more we<br>study genomics the more we understand<br>about how cells work but at the same<br>time the more we know we don't<br>understand I said it's a disruptive<br>technology and it's really technology<br>led when I went through Auckland Medical<br>School 30-something years ago we didn't<br>learn about genomics at all but nowadays<br>we use small DNA sequencing machines<br>with the second-year medical students<br>who sequence something just five or ten<br>years ago we had these massive<br>sequencing machines that took up most of<br>a room now we've got one<br>you can hold in your hand and plug into<br>your laptop or even better ones that<br>plug into your iPhone<br>this is an iPhone just here with a<br>plugged in the bottom in a survey that a<br>very talented PhD student a surgeon<br>Deborah right working with me did in<br>2011 a very high proportion of cancer<br>specialists in New Zealand predicted<br>that the frequency of use of genomic and<br>similar molecular assays and the<br>influence on their clinical decisions<br>for patients would increase so there's a<br>really high expectation in the clinical<br>community at least that we have to live<br>up to with genomics so I'm going to give<br>you now a couple of examples where<br>genomics have transformed something in<br>our understanding of cancer and this<br>first example was led by my colleague<br>Annette elation in collaboration with<br>University of Otago researchers led by<br>Anthony Braithwaite and some Sydney<br>researchers and this is a example where<br>we looked at over a thousand breast<br>tumors and we looked at all of the genes<br>in each of those breast tumors and how<br>they were used by building computer<br>models we were able to work out that a<br>particular protein in these cells called<br>yb1 acted as a trigger that turned on a<br>proliferation or cell division mechanism<br>in these cells we didn't know this<br>previously previously we had no idea how<br>yb1 really worked<br>or rather we thought it worked in many<br>different ways and just weren't sure why<br>v1 turns out to be a protein or a gene<br>that you can measure in cells to<br>identify the prognosis of patients and<br>we've been very lucky in that using<br>similar techniques to what lamia's<br>described we've been able to use<br>high-throughput screening to get a small<br>number of chemical compounds that appear<br>to inhibit the action of yb1 which we<br>hope may be the start of understanding<br>how to develop a drug when we did this<br>work we found that in about 8<br>of ovarian cancers about 4% of breast<br>cancers this yb1 gene is so important<br>for the growth of the cancers that it's<br>copied and there's many many copies of<br>the gene so that's an example using<br>genomics linked with mathematics we call<br>that bioinformatics to really understand<br>an individual molecule but actually the<br>way cancers evolve they start at<br>individual cells which then divide and<br>get more and more mutations as they<br>continue to grow and this is a form of<br>evolution in practice in a study led by<br>Ben Lawrence microphone lay myself and<br>several colleagues in the room into<br>neuro endocrine tumors we've started to<br>untangle the whole genome complexity of<br>these cancers this is a graph just<br>showing how different chromosomes in<br>these tumors have different numbers of<br>copies or different splits between the<br>originally inherited alleles from two<br>parents in many of these tumors about<br>25% the tumors appear to be driven to<br>grow not by mutations but by complex<br>loss and gain of whole chromosomes that<br>same team chromosomes appear to be lost<br>in about 25% of the choose we've no idea<br>how this works yet so this is a<br>brand-new complexity that we've<br>discovered using genomics about how<br>cancer cells grow all of this new<br>discovery about how cancer cells grow is<br>leading to us understanding how we can<br>improve treatments in the graph that<br>leaming showed you where there was a<br>tail off of survival we want to use<br>genomics to better predict which<br>patients can do well with treatment and<br>in the other patients who don't do so<br>well to be able to identify why the<br>ultimate goal would be to play chess<br>with tumors to sequence treatments based<br>on the genomic evolution of the tumor<br>but that still remains in the future in<br>the area of pathology they used to be<br>this phrase the therapy<br>funnel where people would talk about a<br>variety of different histological or<br>microscopic appearances of tumors and<br>they'd use this to help identify which<br>drugs would be used and then as genomics<br>started to have an impact on pathology<br>we started to talk about a therapeutic<br>prism and this is an example in lung<br>cancer which mark McKeague is going to<br>talk further about about how different<br>mutations in different genes can help<br>identify likelihoods of responses or<br>resistance to different therapies these<br>days though we're trying to go beyond<br>this and combine whole genome<br>information to integrate in mathematical<br>models everything we know about a tumor<br>to better predict what drug what<br>prognosis and to match the right drug to<br>the right person as was alluded to by<br>build any one of the most exciting<br>technologies is using the sensitivity of<br>genomics to follow cancers through their<br>evolution I've got a colleague in Otago<br>Neil Gaiman who's sequencing lochness to<br>try and prove once and for all that<br>there is or is not a Loch Ness monster<br>and the reason he can do that is that<br>DNA sequencing is so sensitive that it<br>can detect a few molecules which<br>presumably have a loch ness monster<br>specific DNA sequence in the whole lock<br>well we can do the same thing in the<br>much smaller lock of the human blood and<br>this is a slide from a project led by<br>Sandra Fitzgerald Rosalie Stevens John<br>matthean several other clinicians in<br>Auckland where we're trying to follow<br>patients through the immune checkpoint<br>inhibitors that lei Ming Cheng told you<br>about to identify whether patients are<br>responding or not very early on and this<br>is following through three courses of<br>these checkpoint inhibitors and sadly<br>this is an example of a patient who is<br>not responding as these graphs of<br>trending upwards this is<br>telling you that the amount of mutations<br>that have leaked out of the tumor into<br>the patient's blood is gradually<br>increasing as the tumors continue to<br>grow despite the therapy so I'd like to<br>conclude by first of all reiterating<br>that this disruptive technology of<br>genomics and all the computer work that<br>goes with it is truly transforming what<br>we know about cancer but it's also<br>telling us how much we don't know the<br>major limitation to how we can use<br>genomics in the clinic is how much we<br>don't know about genes and proteins and<br>tumor cells and this is why basic<br>fundamental research such as is funded<br>by the Cancer Society a armory for many<br>others remains critically important<br>we've not solved cancer<br>we've just learned how much more we need<br>to do the second point I wanted to make<br>is that genomics is genuinely beginning<br>to guide precision oncology patients are<br>genuinely starting to benefit however<br>there's a few inequities creeping into<br>this as a rather socialist person I'd<br>love to see the democratization of<br>genomics and genomics being freely and<br>equally available one of the ways that<br>we're hoping to be able to do that is<br>with some of these new technologies like<br>measuring the circulating tumor DNA<br>measuring mutations in patients blood<br>can be easily done on a mer I clinic or<br>away from a hospital and we're hoping<br>that this isn't another perpetuator of<br>inequity in health in New Zealand but<br>rather these technologies can actually<br>reduce inequities thank you very much<br>Thank You crystal of you talk any<br>I think that's probably a laymen<br>question I hike do you want me to hand<br>it over to you give it a go Chris this<br>is a adoptive cell transfer approach I<br>understand if I'm thinking of the right<br>paper and I think the main challenge<br>with it is to use technologies like<br>genomics to identify why this is working<br>in some patients and not others<br>professor rod Dunbar in Auckland is<br>working up these technologies in New<br>Zealand were very lucky that we've got a<br>very active research program into these<br>technologies here thank you we will move<br>on for benefit of time so thank you very<br>much Chris yes talk it's now my distinct<br>pleasure and honor to introduce<br>Professor Bruce Bagley Distinguished<br>Professor Bruce Bagley Bruce grew up in<br>Hamilton and trained as initially as a<br>chemist but saw the light and moved into<br>biology he then did a postdoc after his<br>PhD in Auckland at a postdoc in in<br>Switzerland and returned in 1968 to work<br>in what is now known as the Auckland<br>Cancer Society Research Center since<br>that time he's either been director or<br>co-director someone's phone and Bruce<br>his major research interest has been in<br>the development of anti-cancer drugs<br>where comprehensive laboratory studies<br>can be complemented by clinical trials<br>in cancer patients so if that<br>introduction I'd like to welcome Bruce<br>to the podium<br>thanks mark and thanks everybody for<br>so this title of this talk were sexually<br>not my idea was somehow got transposed<br>but then I started thinking about it and<br>well actually it's quite a good quite a<br>good talk quite quite a title because as<br>you see from that what I want to talk<br>I want particularly since it's 50 years<br>from the start of the medical school to<br>go back in time a little bit because the<br>a year the medical school started here<br>was also the year that I started with<br>Bruce came team and Bruce was not only<br>an amazing medicinal chemist but he had<br>a real concern for cancer patients in<br>trying to develop new treatments for<br>cancer at which at that stage was quite<br>a deter quite an early stage so he one<br>of the first things he did for me was to<br>introduce me to a clinician John<br>Buchanan who is a hematologist and John<br>when I talked to him said that one of<br>the problems was that they had a new<br>drug exciting new drug for treating our<br>leukemia but it only worked in some<br>patients and not others and so was there<br>a way of picking in advance which<br>patients might respond and which<br>patients don't respond and since it was<br>a blood condition that's we could get a<br>blood sample which is quite easy to take<br>well hopefully most patients easier to<br>take and we could use set to decide<br>whether the patients might respond or<br>not now I don't want to talk about this<br>the actual project because it was quite<br>interesting but one of the things which<br>was important for me personally was that<br>I got to talk to patients who would go<br>every week to the hospital and collect<br>blood samples for these studies and so<br>for the first time really in my career I<br>got to talk to a lot of cancer patients<br>about what their views were and what<br>their aspirations were and one of the<br>things which struck me particularly was<br>that they wanted to help other people so<br>a lot of the their willingness to<br>provide samples and so on was aimed at<br>helping people in the future and so it's<br>quite inspired by the people that are<br>that I met at that time and it was<br>now I want to leap for a little bit now<br>because it's a better probably another<br>20 years and over that time there's a<br>whole lot of technological advances and<br>how we could look at cancer cells and<br>the kind of equipment in the lab was<br>changing and not only that we had some<br>some good people that are arriving<br>Graham Findlay joined the group and he<br>was an expert on cell culture and a very<br>good person to have in the lab John<br>Matthews was an enthusiast for cancer<br>treatment as a clinician and wanted to<br>see how we could bring ideas from the<br>lab back to the cancer patient so we're<br>in a good position to do that and we<br>thought that one of the things we'd like<br>to do is to take a sample when a patient<br>had surgery for other types of cancer<br>take a sample and and cultured in the<br>lab and then find out by exposing those<br>cultured cells to two different drugs<br>stuff which one was the best one for the<br>patient and he kept going there a little<br>bit further and say well if we had those<br>cultures we could use those to assess<br>new drugs that were coming out of Bruce<br>Kane's program so this for never double<br>advantage in a way if we could make that<br>kind of system work well and in 1989 we<br>had a some good luck in a way because we<br>employed with the help of funding from<br>the Health Research Council before<br>Elaine Marshall to do this and she was<br>not only a very excellent person for<br>getting these cells to grow she have<br>sort of green fingers for this but she<br>also knew how to talk to patients and<br>give the permission because we needed<br>ethical permission for all this she knew<br>how to talk to the theater nurses and so<br>on so the the samples from the surgery<br>came to the lab rather than being thrown<br>out she talked to the surgeons and<br>pathologists because all of those people<br>had to be involved in this whole process<br>and so she's real Jim as far as<br>this program project was concerned and<br>behind her sheep we had another person<br>Wayne Wayne Joseph it's still working<br>with us in fact who acted as a fantastic<br>backup person could do those things as<br>well<br>so we're very lucky to have that kind of<br>assist system going so what are these<br>cells look like once they've we get them<br>from surgery and take them into the lab<br>the first thing we do is to actually cut<br>them up into very small pieces because<br>they have to be portioned out to various<br>tiny tiny cultures and so this picture<br>here is probably magnified about a<br>thousand times and each of these little<br>clumps have got several hundred tumor<br>cells and if you go one further and this<br>is now another 100 times Fury magnified<br>so something like 100,000 fold<br>magnification you can see what looks<br>Strangers be forgiven for thinking it<br>looks like spaghetti and meatballs but<br>the spawn of spaghetti is actually<br>fibers like collagen which form a kind<br>of a nest for the tumor to grow in and<br>the gray parts are the tumor cells<br>themselves now one of the problems when<br>we take this tissue from surgery and<br>mentioned we have to cut it up into tiny<br>bits that induces a reaction called a<br>wounding response you might imagine<br>if you take piece of tissue and chop it<br>up it's kind of caused a lot of physical<br>damage and the body reacts to that by<br>certain cells that start dividing to try<br>and repair that damage and so you've got<br>to be very careful if you are doing this<br>you end up looking at the the response<br>rather than the tumor itself so hinter<br>differentiate those things and grandf<br>and they found a nice way of being able<br>to suppress the wounding response and so<br>we can actually just look at the at the<br>effects of on the cancer cells<br>themselves<br>essentially not a robot insect on the<br>other end of us is weighing in the<br>business<br>shaking eventers because I'm on the<br>camera<br>but this is a type of manipulation that<br>to apportion these cells and tiny<br>so of the many hundreds of patients this<br>is just a selection so you can see that<br>there are many different types of tumors<br>that we've got samples from and many<br>different surgeons that were involved in<br>these projects and these are just some<br>of the surgeons and this is a project<br>which is still going on and we're just<br>sort of completing it now but it's been<br>going for thirty years it's a long<br>project and you can see how you need to<br>have a large number of samples in order<br>to really find out what's going on and<br>one of the things we look for we thought<br>we grow these cultures that we might<br>find for a particular patient when we<br>grew these cultures that those cells<br>were really responsive to one of the<br>drugs and they didn't work with other<br>some so in that way we could say this is<br>the drug that we should use for that<br>patient and for another patient and<br>other than would light up and we could<br>use that one but didn't really work out<br>the same instrument like that we found<br>that there was a tendency when we got a<br>sample from a patient that either it was<br>sort of sensitive to everything or it<br>was resistant to everything so what was<br>going on that we could get a picture<br>like that there was a long time to to<br>understand what was happening and the<br>result was that these different cultures<br>actually growing at different rates and<br>we found that the growth rate in culture<br>related to see what was going on in the<br>patient as well and we went further than<br>that and had to get involved with sort<br>of mathematical modeling and so on and<br>people with mathematicians try and work<br>out on a population basis what was going<br>on so it's a long long process but it<br>was a very interesting set of results<br>because we found things that we hadn't<br>expected before now I just wanted to<br>stop a moment and talk about what's<br>what's in cancer tissue because you sort<br>of think of cancer tissue as being just<br>cancer cells in fact there's a lot of<br>different cells in there and doing<br>different things so the cancer cells and<br>this<br>favorite fibrous a little nest for the<br>tumor and the fire blasts that make that<br>nest there's also a blood supply and you<br>can see in this this picture here<br>there's a colored red cell here and this<br>is a capillary containing the blood<br>supply for that particular tumor and<br>also you have immune cells that lemming<br>has talked about but also you have what<br>might call a sanitation system you need<br>cells specialized that dispose of the<br>corpses of the dead tuna cells and why<br>do you need this well might just start<br>with the question of how fast a tumor<br>grows in a human how long does it take<br>for a tumor to actually double its<br>volume it might be surprising to you to<br>find out that the time taken to double<br>the volume of over the average human<br>tumor is about four months so it grows<br>more slowly than we give them credit for<br>those some tumors will grow faster than<br>them and that means if you think about<br>the mathematics of this is that we can<br>find out that individual cancer cells<br>doubled in number and about a week but<br>the tumor itself doubles its number in<br>about four months and this means that<br>there's a cell death going on all the<br>cells from the tumor continue they are<br>dying off at quite a rate and this is a<br>place-- process called turnover and you<br>can sort of think about that or you can<br>go and talk to an accountant who knows<br>all about turnover it's the same sort of<br>process so but it's possible just to<br>ignore this and say well the cells die<br>and it's that's all the risk to it and<br>that different tumors have different<br>grapes of turnover so different numbers<br>of dead cells have been formed and<br>transported away by the Sanitation<br>system well why is that important it's<br>important because dying cancer cells<br>themselves<br>send out a signal which is effective on<br>the whole immune system and so dying<br>cells make a signal to these sanitation<br>system cells that that tell them to eat<br>it up because that's the way that these<br>cells when it got rid of because other<br>cells them out but depending on how many<br>you have the system can get pushed in<br>one one direction or another so if it's<br>on a sort of an active phase in this the<br>system actually works together with the<br>immune system that lemming was talking<br>about and getting rid of tumor cells<br>recognizing and getting rid of them if<br>it's being sort of overloaded it goes to<br>another mode called wound healing where<br>it's really primarily concerned with<br>mopping up the damage and and it<br>actually suppresses the immunity so<br>that's a really important area if we can<br>understand that perhaps and some tumors<br>they've sort of exhausted as far as<br>their immune properties are concerned<br>and they stopped stopped working<br>properly<br>so in fact Stacey on on this on the<br>other side there's a student from here<br>who's now working at the University of<br>Bergen and in Norway and she's really<br>interested in this this area and<br>particularly in the the vitamin K seems<br>to be involved in this process as well<br>so if we could manipulate that and help<br>to turn the immune system back on again<br>we have a really important area to<br>develop as far as cancer is consumed and<br>the next steps it's a personal one for<br>me because in ten days time I'm going on<br>on leave and we're going to be working<br>in this lab and Norway on exactly this<br>this problem and trying to understand<br>what is going on and what is interesting<br>here is that the group in Norway have<br>got a new drug which works exactly in<br>this area<br>and at some clinical trial at the moment<br>and the results so far promising so this<br>is a new direction in a way of finding<br>out new ways and you might notice among<br>the talks that we've had so far there<br>are many different approaches to the<br>same problem so that's what we're going<br>to what I'm going to do and then come<br>come back here towards the end of the<br>year so in summary this is a thicker<br>picture an impression is pictured<br>dealing with some point illness and I<br>suppose sera I think of this the artist<br>but the point here in this picture is<br>that it's made up of a large number of<br>tiny little colored patches but when you<br>start to put them all together you've<br>seen a bigger picture and I think this<br>is what we feel with this culture system<br>that hundreds of patients have provided<br>samples we've collected data and we can<br>click more data using techniques what<br>Chris has talked about and gradually<br>picked up pick up a picture of of what<br>is really going on in human cancer at<br>the body level just to finish just like<br>to think particularly their cancer<br>patients because they've been very many<br>of them and they've all contributed to<br>this picture and their contributions<br>will carry on into the future it's<br>involved a large number of surgeons and<br>pathologists nurses to people in the<br>hospital and as first that of course all<br>the people behind the toilet is blaming<br>this mentioned that are working in the<br>cancer lab and they've all contributed<br>so I'll stop there and thank you for<br>listening<br>the other end of the world or down in<br>this part of the world a little ol<br>newzealand that newzealand really<br>punches well above its weight in terms<br>of its prowess in terms of cancer<br>research well of course that the Lebanon<br>Norway came to us in a way because they<br>recognize us as a as a leader as well so<br>it's it's a two-way thing it's not not<br>that the Belarus appeared you're ours<br>it's it's really a discussion from two<br>different points of view and different<br>do different backgrounds and I think<br>that's the sort of in Richards cancer<br>research when you work together with<br>other people like that so it's not one<br>one versus the other I think it's most<br>working together and you know they are<br>building on the legacy we've had by<br>Britain and are growing all of these<br>cancer cells form patients they can now<br>be useful for other studies in different<br>countries<br>yeah ladies and gentlemen it's it's a<br>real pleasure to invite professor mark<br>McKee to give us a talk on personalized<br>medicine mark is a physician scientist<br>with many years experience as a research<br>group leader he's also a practicing<br>medical oncologist clinical trial<br>investigator a teacher of pharmacology<br>oncology and clinical medicine with over<br>100 research articles and 3,500<br>citations published in Mark also finds<br>time to be a professor in the department<br>of pharmacology and clinical<br>pharmacology and co-director of the<br>Auckland Cancer Society research centre<br>ladies and gentlemen mark McKee well<br>thank you so good evening and<br>personalized cancer medicine what has it<br>achieved against New Zealand's biggest<br>so lung cancer is the biggest cancer<br>killer in New Zealand as shown here by<br>this data from the Ministry of Health<br>so lung cancer is the leading cause of<br>cancer death accounting for about 20<br>percent of all cancer deaths so this is<br>that if percentage caused by lung cancer<br>ahead of other major cancer killers in<br>New Zealand colorectal cancer breast<br>cancer prostate cancer and pancreatic<br>cancer lung cancer is the fifth most<br>common cancer registered in New Zealand<br>it accounts for about 2,000 cases of<br>cancer each year and it unfortunately<br>has poor survival<br>so only 30% of lung cancer patients will<br>so our society stigmatizes people with<br>lung cancer possibly because of its<br>association with death and smoking and<br>these negative attitudes towards lung<br>cancer are scientifically proven in<br>research so formal investigations such<br>as shown here which investigated a<br>comparative attitudes to breast cancer<br>versus lung cancer showing that<br>attitudes are much more negative with<br>concerning lung cancer than breast<br>cancer so but smoking habits have<br>changed greatly in New Zealand so<br>currently 60% of our population are<br>never smokers and 25% are former smokers<br>and only 15% are current smokers so if<br>this room was representative of the New<br>Zealand population perhaps the people in<br>the middle between the two aisles would<br>be the never smokers the people over on<br>the right here on my right maybe they<br>are the former smokers so they no longer<br>smoke but have smoked over 100<br>cigarettes in their lifetime and the<br>people on my left left over in this<br>aisle are the current smokers who are<br>struggling with their dirty habit so but<br>this hope from new personalized<br>approaches to lung cancer treatment so<br>personalized treatment involves of lung<br>cancer involves the identification of<br>molecular drivers of lung cancer in each<br>individual<br>patient and then using that information<br>to individualize their therapy it<br>involves no longer treating lung cancer<br>is one disease but a series of<br>individual diseases and treating it<br>accordingly<br>it involves collecting a specimen of the<br>lung cancer prior to treatment and<br>undertaking an analysis of that tissue<br>about its genetic makeup and protein<br>expression to understand to try and<br>identify the key driver of of that<br>cancer particularly those drivers that<br>can be disabled by a specific drug<br>treatment so within the last five years<br>these personalized lung cancer<br>treatments have been introduced into the<br>New Zealand healthcare system and so<br>with others I've been studying the<br>uptake of these new approaches and the<br>impact they have had on lung cancer in<br>New Zealand so epidermal growth factor<br>receptor or EGFR mutation positive lung<br>cancer was the first molecularly defined<br>subtype of lung cancer for which a<br>personalized treatment became available<br>in New Zealand so between 2012 and 2015<br>PHARMAC funded a lot and a benefit on it<br>which are EGFR inhibitors for use for<br>treating EGFR mutation positive lung<br>cancer at the same time the Ministry of<br>Health published guidelines for the<br>testing of lung cancer for EGFR<br>mutations and so we've been studying how<br>well these these new treatments have<br>been implemented in our healthcare<br>system and found that the uptake of<br>testing has increased with time up to to<br>reach a testing of 75% of patients who<br>are eligible for testing and that's<br>about the highest rate in the world so<br>we're doing pretty well on a lot of<br>global<br>scale also we've been able to understand<br>how prevalent EGFR mutation lung cancer<br>AB mutation positive lung cancer is in<br>our population so the prevalence and the<br>attested population is about 22% so we<br>would estimate that would be about 300<br>patients per year will present a New<br>Zealand with this molecular Li defined<br>form of lung cancer it has also<br>challenged the stereotypes about lung<br>cancer so it's enabled us to look at the<br>smoking status of patients presenting<br>with lung cancer who are eligible for<br>this testing and so which surprised us<br>because most of the lung cancer patients<br>are coming from the group over on our<br>right the former smokers that's the<br>orange bar there and then the next most<br>common most patients come from the<br>current smokers but almost the same<br>number of patients come from the middle<br>group they're never smokers so this is<br>really challenged the stereotype that<br>lung cancer is a problem of them the<br>smokers it's really not in our society<br>and our research has also allowed us to<br>study the impact that the introduction<br>of this testing and targeted therapy has<br>had on the survival of lung cancer<br>patients shown here so comparing<br>patients who were untested who have<br>relatively poor survival compared to<br>those who have who are tested and are<br>found to have an EGFR mutation in their<br>tumor and can be treated with one of<br>these drugs and even the patients who<br>are tested and have a have no mutation<br>have better survival compared to those<br>who are not tested so testing is<br>associated with improved overall<br>survival irrespective of the result of<br>that testing so an apply state lymphoma<br>kinase gene rearrangement positive or<br>alt positive lung cancers another<br>molecular defined<br>and highly treatable new lung cancer<br>subsidy subtype so this<br>l+ lung cancer was discovered in Japan<br>in 2007 and in 2015 the very first<br>treatment for specific treatment for<br>alt+ lung cancer crizotinib was approved<br>by mid safe in this country so for use<br>in New Zealand but here in 2018 we still<br>have no PHARMAC subsidised treatments or<br>national testing program for identifying<br>patients for without positive lung<br>cancer but in our research we have been<br>trying to learn about the prevalence the<br>profile and outcomes of alka positive<br>lung cancer patients in our population<br>so what is surprising despite the lack<br>of any farm act subsidized treatments<br>clinicians are still doing a lot of<br>testing they think it's important to<br>identify these patients and so over<br>three and a half over 350 patients have<br>been tested in northern New Zealand for<br>elq positive lung cancer so this has<br>allowed us to estimate the prevalence<br>which is eight point five percent of<br>tested patients which would mean in New<br>Zealand there will be each year over a<br>hundred patients present with elq<br>positive lung cancer we've also been<br>able to look at the profile of these<br>patients and it's surprising again<br>challenges the stereotypes out cause of<br>lung cancer patients are young most are<br>less than sixty most of them have never<br>smoked and they're more likely to be<br>Asian Pacific or Maori than bulk<br>negative who are mostly Caucasian and<br>we've also been able to look at the<br>survival outcomes of patients with alt+<br>lung cancer in the absence of any<br>farming subsidised treatments so for<br>patients who unfortunately have been<br>unable to access any specific ALP<br>treatment through a clinical trial or<br>access scheme their survival is as we<br>would expect for lung cancer so most<br>patients die within one year of<br>diagnosis whereas for those that are<br>able to access ELQ specific treatments<br>through clinical trials or access<br>schemes 90% is still alive two years<br>after diagnosis so a dramatic difference<br>in survival outcomes meaning that once<br>we get around to implementing ELQ<br>testing and targeted therapy in New<br>Zealand this will greatly improve<br>survival no doubt so the final subtype<br>of lung cancer I'd like to briefly talk<br>about is that it's defined molecularly<br>by its strong expression of a protein<br>called PDL one and it is highly<br>sensitive to immunotherapy with t<br>Trudeau so this is personalized<br>immunotherapy for lung cancer and<br>programmed cell death like in one is<br>expressed on tumor cells and helps the<br>tumor cells resist immune attack but<br>it's very variably expressed between<br>different patients so some patients have<br>tumors that have very little expression<br>other patients have tumors that have a<br>lot of expression of this PDL one and<br>what we know from clinical trials<br>elsewhere as if you select lung cancer<br>patients with very high expression then<br>you're selecting a group of patients<br>that benefit a lot from key Trudeau<br>treatment and this is a clinical trial<br>of key Trudeau in PDL one strongly over<br>expressing lung cancer and in this trial<br>Keith Reuter more than doubles survival<br>has less side effects but unfortunate is<br>more expensive currently we have no<br>local data on prevalence or profile of<br>PDL one strongly expressing lung cancer<br>in New Zealand and we have no testing<br>guidelines or state subsidized treatment<br>so I'd like to finish by urging you to<br>support these strong advocates of lung<br>cancer prevention and treatment so<br>firstly the lung Foundation who are a<br>new group and are doing important work<br>advocating to the government and others<br>for better access<br>lung cancer patients to treatment and<br>care<br>recently the lung Cancer Foundation<br>approached the health ministry officials<br>about the parlous state of lung cancer<br>treatments in New Zealand and those<br>health ministry officials then<br>transferred their health other lung<br>Foundation on to the minister of tobacco<br>so this so the problem with attitudes to<br>lung cancer go right to the top so it's<br>perceived in our government as a tax<br>issue rather than a health care issue<br>and also the Cancer Society who have<br>then continued to really important work<br>in striving towards a smoke-free New<br>Thank You Mack for a wonderful talk any<br>the question was the question was why do<br>such a large number of lung cancer<br>patients well patient people get lung<br>cancer and are not smokers it's it's<br>because there's a significant proportion<br>of the total lung cancer that is not<br>related to smoking the these are the<br>forms of lung cancer that we now<br>recognize have specific molecular<br>drivers like EGFR or elk and smoking<br>does not play a role in the cause of<br>those types of cancer these will become<br>increasingly important because smoking<br>will eventually die up from our society<br>and that means that the lung cancer<br>burden will end former smokers will<br>eventually disappear from our society<br>and that means that the lung cancer<br>burden will be from never smokers one<br>the question is is small cell lung<br>cancer a subset of lung cancers use<br>describing this evening or is it a<br>separate cancer small cell it's a it's a<br>subtype of lung cancer overall it<br>probably accounts for 10 to 15% of all<br>lung cancer it is becoming less common<br>as smoking becomes less prevalent and in<br>our society well that's a good question<br>I don't think we know thank you my well<br>answered there's always questions that<br>we can answer and so on that note I'd<br>like to introduce our next speaker thank<br>you Matt fifth American gut<br>professor gut is has had 20 years of<br>experience in conducting research within<br>the older population and with interest<br>in developing models of palliative care<br>and end-of-life care Meryl Marin is a<br>director of the TRA<br>palliative care and end-of-life research<br>group and that conducts research and a<br>multidisciplinary cultural setting by<br>using social creative social research<br>methods to inform practice and policy<br>Batman with very much looking forward to<br>a talk which will be quite a different<br>switch from what we've been talking<br>about that welcome thank you very much<br>for tonight a total take cutter good<br>evening everybody it's great to have<br>this opportunity to tell you a little<br>bit about the work of the Terai<br>palliative care research group and it's<br>late and I'm hungry so rest assured I'm<br>not going to take up too much of your<br>time and I'm also going to talk about<br>something that we all know something<br>about and that's caregiving so Rosalyn<br>Carter<br>former first lady and who's now a carer<br>activist says there's only four types of<br>people in this world those who've been<br>care<br>those who are caregivers those who will<br>be caregivers and those who need<br>caregivers so essentially we all have a<br>vested interest to get this right and I<br>want to talk about caregiving within a<br>particular context and that context is<br>palliative care because despite the<br>sterling efforts of my colleagues I've<br>got bad news for you and the mortality<br>rate is still a hundred percent so we<br>still do need palliative approaches to<br>care and this is an approach to care for<br>anyone with a life limiting illness so<br>our work includes cancer but it's not<br>exclusive to cancer and we also know<br>that palliative care can actually not<br>only improved quality of life but it can<br>also extend life and that was a trial<br>I'm done with people with lung cancer in<br>the States<br>I'm critical to the discussion that<br>we're having today it can also<br>significantly increase quality of life<br>for caregivers and I should say that in<br>New Zealand you can either receive<br>palliative care through a specialist<br>service or about a third of people will<br>receive it that way or via your usual<br>care provider very often your GP just<br>another point of contact these are<br>figures produced by a member of my group<br>Heather McLeod for the Ministry of<br>Health looking at need for palliative<br>care and the take-home message is that<br>within the next 35 years the need for<br>palliative care is going to almost<br>double and this is huge and within the<br>context of what I think were<br>euphemistically calling a constrained<br>health system it means that more and<br>more work is going to be put onto family<br>caregivers and the nature of this work<br>is becoming much more complex so we know<br>that being a caregiver can bring<br>benefits and I want us to remember that<br>but I also want to talk a little bit<br>about the costs it can bring and those<br>can be physical psychological social and<br>what I particularly wanted to mention is<br>financial because it's something we<br>don't really talk very much about but<br>I'm really keen to further explore the<br>financial costs of caregiving because<br>unless we know those the economic<br>analyses that we conduct actually<br>exclude all the costs that are incurred<br>by caregivers so we say well you know we<br>can reduce hospitalizations and this<br>saves the health system money<br>but what those lots of analyses don't<br>recognize is actually that a lot of<br>money is being put on to families and so<br>we explored this within the context of<br>Auckland and I just wanted to tell you<br>one story because I think our work makes<br>us social activists and makes us want to<br>create change and this is one of those<br>stories that stays with you and this is<br>two sisters we spoke to his mother was<br>dying in Auckland Hospital and they<br>couldn't actually both sit with her at<br>the same time because they couldn't<br>afford the parking so you know it's<br>really shocking that these are the sorts<br>of situations that people are living<br>with them as I said it's these sort of<br>stories that keep us going and motivated<br>in our work to create change what else<br>do we know well we know that family<br>caregivers spent approximately 70 hours<br>a week caring in the last three months<br>of someone's life so a huge amount of<br>work however they often struggle to<br>access the supports and information they<br>need and I'm sure those of you here who<br>have been caregivers will we'll find<br>some resonance with this and<br>particularly with the fact that<br>caregivers are having to navigate a<br>really fragmented health and social care<br>system and we talked a lot about<br>professional care navigators but open<br>with the lack of recognition that<br>families are actually often out there<br>doing this work already but they often<br>feel unsupported by health professionals<br>and health systems which is so siloed<br>our health system is so siloed and it's<br>family caregivers that are often there<br>trying to put the pieces of the puzzle<br>together but I didn't want to send you<br>out into this cold dark night feeling a<br>bit depressed about the state of things<br>I wanted to finish by saying a little<br>bit about what our research is doing to<br>make a difference so firstly our<br>research has been critical to informing<br>new policy directions by the Ministry of<br>Health so there was a new poly<br>palliative care action plan announced<br>last year and for the first time there's<br>a really significant focus upon family<br>caregivers it's one of the five priority<br>areas and I worked in really<br>instrumental in underpinning that shift<br>in focus but we are not naive enough to<br>think that policy<br>itself creates significant change there<br>wasn't any untargeted money put against<br>this policy but we also work a lot in<br>partnership with lots of different<br>service providers there's lots of<br>different people working in space so we<br>work with DHBs we work with the aged<br>care sectors a really big group for us<br>we work with communities and we work<br>with NGOs as well and just to mention<br>one project we're currently working with<br>colleagues at a dhb and they recognize<br>that the one area of patient experience<br>they don't know anything about at the<br>moment is what's happening at the end of<br>life so we piloted a questionnaire<br>perhaps being rolled out now across ADHD<br>we've got over 600 family carers who<br>who've completed that and that's for<br>anyone who's had a contact with ADHD in<br>their last year of life and what's<br>looking really positive is that ADHD are<br>keen to pick this up as a routine<br>service improvement measure so for the<br>first time will actually have<br>experiential data from the people who<br>are most affected to actually inform<br>policy and service development and<br>already there's some really interesting<br>stuff coming through and the palliative<br>care Government's group you're looking<br>at how those changes can start to be<br>made education and training who are in<br>university so all our research is<br>directly feeding into education and<br>training within the School of Nursing<br>we have palliative care as a thread that<br>runs throughout all our curricula we<br>also have specialist programs and we<br>also feed into public debate and to do<br>this and we're very aware that research<br>can sometimes be a bit dry and boring so<br>we look at creative ways of getting our<br>research out there so for example our<br>last HRC project we actually worked with<br>colleagues at the Faculty of Arts and we<br>made a film so we had actors talking to<br>the narratives that people were telling<br>us the stories they were telling us and<br>this is being as used as a resource for<br>training GPS for example and it's also<br>being used within communities to have<br>conversations so lots of the issues that<br>we find out about actually then create<br>don't require a huge amount of resource<br>to fix and one thing that we're trying<br>to do all the time is to look at where<br>we can actually do something that will<br>make a big difference<br>but there's not huge amounts of money in<br>this space so you know what can we do<br>with not very much so we're starting to<br>create a lot more resources for<br>caregivers so for example together with<br>undergrad nursing students my colleague<br>Michael Boyd has just created a resource<br>for people around choosing an aged care<br>facility so aged care facilities are<br>actually the most significant providers<br>of palliative care in New Zealand at the<br>moment particularly if you're a woman so<br>we're really looking at how we can make<br>palliative care better in those settings<br>and these sorts of resources you know<br>the sorts of things to look at when you<br>might want to choose a facility are the<br>sorts of things people have been telling<br>us that they want to receive and then<br>finally but probably most importantly<br>we're working alongside caregivers and<br>alongside communities to help them<br>identify what supports they want and<br>what can be put in place from their<br>point of view so for example the group<br>on the right of your slide their<br>community collaborators and komar TOA<br>from a new project led by my colleague<br>Tessmacher maxwell which is funded by<br>the HRC and that's looking at how mari<br>end-of-life care practices can be<br>gathered that information can be<br>gathered because this was something like<br>Omar to have felt was being lost and<br>it's going to be used to create a<br>digital resource so far no can can<br>accessing that information when they<br>need it we also supported this this lady<br>here Ross capper who's an amazing<br>activist and she wrote the first<br>practical guide to caregiving that was<br>written actually by an ex caregiver and<br>then finally at the bottom we worked<br>with the Pacific community and this is<br>why it really pays to actually ask<br>people what they want because I think we<br>went in thinking oh well they're<br>probably some sort of information<br>leaflets or maybe some educational<br>sessions but what they actually wanted<br>and this was a group of older female<br>caregivers was to create a music video<br>so they actually got a local rap group<br>to create a music video and if I had<br>time would play it to you but I don't<br>but it's fantastic and I never thought<br>that in my research career I'd produce a<br>music video but<br>one of the most exciting thing I have<br>ever created but what's great is it's<br>being used within Pacific communities<br>within churches to actually spark a<br>debate about the sorts of support that<br>caregivers need so that it's all I<br>wanted to tell you tonight so thank you<br>very much for listening I'd like to<br>acknowledge the rest of my group that's<br>about 12 to 15 of us we're a very<br>multidisciplinary team and also all our<br>research participants because it you<br>know we speak to people at what is often<br>not a very easy time of their lives but<br>I think as Bruce said earlier people<br>really want to give back and they really<br>want to tell their stories but we're<br>very grateful to them for doing that and<br>thank you for your time<br>you're a fan I just want to ask you<br>everyone what is the current time lag<br>between the end of clinical trials when<br>something is available and when members<br>of the public who have cancer or looking<br>for it can expect to find it it's the<br>first part is there an average length at<br>well I guess I ask that because we've<br>got a grand grandson who had leukemia<br>but the gap between the knowledge<br>knowledge that Judy and I as University<br>staff members can access and and<br>clinicians who are treating them and the<br>other people working with them are so<br>big that we found ourselves resourcing<br>and supporting and arguing and fighting<br>and so we would like better information<br>service available to people and we'd<br>like that funded actually as a research<br>project how to provide better<br>information services to people about<br>what's happening in cancer is wonderful<br>to be here tonight and hear this what's<br>happening but for lots of us this is a<br>one-off yeah so if you could do anything<br>did you pay for the parking no I wish we<br>could have done that actually this was<br>retrospectively so they were telling us<br>this story but yeah I've been thinking<br>about creative ways to do something<br>about that on my radar so if anyone's<br>so um in terms of access to health care<br>and in this case palliative care there<br>tends to be a huge like social economic<br>basis to UM bias and basis to it as as<br>you said in the news article about the<br>two systems had sleep in the car so I<br>was curious as to what you and your<br>group or any other groups doing to like<br>work on reducing this inequality between<br>say make people of different like social<br>economic classes or other like<br>inequities in New Zealand yeah thank you<br>that's a great question so one of the<br>big focuses of our research group is<br>equity so the way we do that is firstly<br>by primarily concentrating on people who<br>don't get access to specialist<br>palliative care because we know that<br>they have a much more difficult time and<br>we also work really closely with<br>different cultural groups to look at<br>specific needs and we're always very<br>sensitive to issues around economics and<br>we're just about to write an hoc grant<br>which is going to look at hopefully<br>probably might get funded but fingers<br>crossed but would look at palliative<br>care provision in economically deprived<br>communities using an athletes assets<br>based approach so looking at kind of<br>what assets they draw on and then from<br>their point of view what the challenges<br>are because I think that's always the<br>key is to to look at the strengths and<br>to look at what people on the ground<br>really want rather than guessing but<br>thank you it's a good question<br>a lot of these people will be older and<br>actually we the system probably doesn't<br>want us living longer because you know<br>so I'm just wondering how it kind of<br>balances out how you well you know what<br>I mean I mean you're right so that the<br>biggest growth in palliative care need<br>is for people over 85 and it's for<br>people with complex comorbidity so what<br>we really need to do is actually to<br>understand a bit more about the sorts of<br>care people need in that situation<br>because our models of palliative care<br>based on younger people with cancer so<br>we need to for example as we are looking<br>at how to improve palliative care and<br>aged care because that's a huge setting<br>for palliative care as I said if you're<br>a woman in over 65 you've got a more<br>than 50% chance of dying while you live<br>I'm ladies and gentlemen that brings us<br>to the end of tonight's program and I<br>just wonder if I could invite all our<br>speakers to just stand up for another<br>round of applause<br>I'm very conscious of time so I thought<br>but I was given the challenge to try and<br>sum up tonight in two minutes<br>so I'll have a go at that seats here we<br>can do because tonight really was a bit<br>of a smorgasbord a sort of a degustation<br>menu of incredible science Bell started<br>off with a very uplifting message around<br>the technology behind some very exciting<br>new drugs that are coming our way and I<br>think the very the great signal there<br>that you know cancer survival rates have<br>more than doubled since the 1970s it<br>still shows us we have a long way to go<br>but I think we get a sense that we are<br>making great progress each and every<br>year liming then put the frighteners on<br>us talking about killer T cells serial<br>killer cells and in weapons of mass<br>destruction but when you think about the<br>context of all of that it sort of makes<br>great sense and how she detailed how our<br>own immune system can be channeled to<br>fight our own cancer Chris was very much<br>the modernist he used the phrase<br>disruptive technology and talked about<br>playing chess with tumors hell science<br>can and understanding the genome the<br>genomes and tumors can outflank and<br>outsmart them and we can get our<br>targeted medicine then there was Bruce<br>and and what we didn't know about Bruce<br>was Bruce plays the cello he's a very<br>accomplished cello player and his<br>message was very much one of culture<br>growing cell lines in culture and<br>translating his laboratory research into<br>trials with with patients and we lived<br>that unique Greenfingers<br>it was good Mark's message was one of<br>great compassion for those in our<br>community with lung cancer who yes it is<br>true are often stigmatized because they<br>have lung cancer and we need to be very<br>compassionate and I think Mark<br>Illustrated that no two cancer's are<br>exactly the same and we can get very<br>much personal if we understand them<br>better we can get very much more<br>effective and personalized medicine and<br>I think Maron finished sings off very<br>nicely with a with a with a refreshing<br>dare I say a very caring approach to the<br>subject that we don't really like to<br>think very much about which is you know<br>palliative care end-of-life care what<br>happens to us in that last stage and<br>this is really really important work<br>because I think as you say we'll all be<br>caregivers and leaders of caregivers at<br>some stage how long<br>so look thank you again for our speakers<br>I thought it was a fantastic event it's<br>great to get these small tastes of<br>what's going on I know our speakers will<br>be staying around so I'm sure please<br>feel free to interact with them you'll<br>have other questions and I'm sure<br>they'll be only too happy to talk to you<br>after the event in the foyer and just as<br>a final word for me a commercial for the<br>next event that we're having here which<br>is on July the 19th and mirror and<br>you'll be very pleased that this is<br>called living longer a social revolution<br>so that's a seven o'clock July the 19th<br>I believe it's in the same place so we'd<br>love to see as many of you as possible<br>coming along to that and please spread<br>the word about these events they're<br>fantastic events and the more people<br>that can attend the better so thank you<br>very much for coming along in a safe<br>journey<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
