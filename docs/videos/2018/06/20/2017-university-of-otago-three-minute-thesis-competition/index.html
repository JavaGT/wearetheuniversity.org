very great pleasure to welcome you<br>here to the 2017 university of otago<br>three minute thesis final I'd like to<br>welcome everyone who's watching by<br>livestream people in the northern Kember<br>campuses and people in the future<br>welcome and I hope you enjoy this<br>special event people in the future would<br>quite like to know if there are still<br>bananas and also if they still fake news<br>if someone could get back to me that<br>would be great<br>all right I'm going to tell you a little<br>bit about the three minute thesis and a<br>little bit of about why I'm so<br>interested in the three minute thesis<br>I'll introduce the judges and then I'll<br>get us underway with what you're really<br>here for which is to hear these<br>wonderful people present their awesome<br>work the three minute thesis was it was<br>devised by the University of Queensland<br>in 2008 the competition has grown and<br>has now run in over 200 countries across<br>the world<br>I looked up one reference and it said 19<br>over 19 countries and then I looked at<br>another one and it said 200 I'm gonna<br>take the larger one because that just<br>seems so much more impressive there's<br>now a New Zealand version for masters<br>students the other versions are for PhD<br>students solely and we were delighted<br>that in the last time that we ran the<br>three-minute thesis<br>Ginny McDowell from the Faculty of<br>Dentistry actually managed to make the<br>final of the trans-tasman three minute<br>thesis competition there is a huge<br>accomplishment in terms of just how many<br>people are involved in that particular<br>competition right so why am i interested<br>in the three-minute thesis I kind of<br>just am about this time last year when<br>my boss Rachel sprung can Smurf Dean of<br>the Graduate research school the in boss<br>was trying to pawn me off on to some<br>other part of the university I said to<br>her alright I'll go but only if you let<br>me still be involved in the three-minute<br>thesis she said ok I'll do it and I hope<br>she doesn't live to regret<br>but I do know that the Faculty of<br>Dentistry might have a few bones to pick<br>with you<br>it's Brandon Smith all right I think the<br>three-minute thesis is a fantastic event<br>for two main reasons the first is it's<br>always a highlight of the Graduate<br>research calendar whenever it's run by<br>the Graduate research school it is<br>always incredibly edifying incredibly<br>enjoying and enjoyable and just amazing<br>to see the fantastic work that our<br>graduate students do it's a fun event<br>but that's not all it is about being<br>able to conduct research on something<br>one loves is a real privilege in my view<br>being able to do that at a university as<br>fantastic as Otago as another real<br>privilege the 3mt provides a wonderful<br>opportunity for the university to<br>showcase the work that our research<br>students are doing our graduate research<br>candidates and you've all got a lot to<br>live up to from this next sentence I can<br>tell you our our future academics and<br>researchers our future captains of<br>industry and our future leaders these<br>are the people that we will see doing<br>great things when we look to those few<br>people of the future who are going to<br>tell me about the existence of bananas<br>I am confident confident that our thesis<br>candidates are of a world-class standard<br>and I am confident that they are<br>receiving world-class supervision by our<br>academic staff our supervisors and<br>advisers who are all incredibly<br>accomplished we have a lot to celebrate<br>here at OU Tago I also love it because<br>it's inspiring to hear and see the<br>creative way that people can talk about<br>their research in such a short period of<br>time and with so few props the 3mt<br>provides an incredible development<br>opportunity it fosters important skills<br>of clarity and brevity this is a skill<br>which will last you throughout life it<br>will help you with elevator pictures and<br>it will most definitely help you<br>when you have an argument with your<br>nearest and dearest preparing a three<br>minutes recess three minute thesis<br>presentation and variably serves to<br>reignite your passion for your research<br>I did it a couple of times I did it very<br>badly but I still enjoyed it and it<br>still was incredibly helpful trying to<br>work out what the essence of your<br>researchers and how to explain that to a<br>layperson and simple and clear terms is<br>a wonderful exercise for us all to do as<br>a staff member getting involved in the<br>3mt provides a lovely opportunity to<br>witness the enthusiasm and the<br>accomplishment of our mini thesis<br>candidates firsthand I said there were<br>two main reasons why I was keen on<br>emceeing the three-minute thesis the<br>second reason is that I'm a frustrated<br>actor stroke director stroke producer<br>stroke writer and I heard that someone<br>from Natural History New Zealand was<br>going to be involved in the judging so I<br>thought this was a great opportunity to<br>pitch a few ideas for some t2 TV and<br>film first as a clock tower orange you<br>know like this it's a dystopian sci-fi<br>film that employs disturbingly violent<br>images about commenting upon PBRs<br>student fees and why you can never find<br>your supervisor on a Friday afternoon<br>the second a soap opera great King<br>Street it's a soap opera about the lives<br>the loves and the tooth extractions of a<br>group of dedicated and gorgeous oral<br>health professionals<br>it's got winner all over it finally<br>survivor 344 dancing with the<br>supervisors a hybrid reality show that<br>drops supervisors and students onto an<br>active volcano makes them dance the<br>tango dance of love until they are<br>competent enough to get their conference<br>funding another winner for all the<br>university community I'm sure<br>don't worry Craig I've got a million of<br>these and I'll talk to you later all<br>right speaking of judges it now gives me<br>immense pleasure to introduce our<br>esteemed judges<br>whenever I'm required to introduce<br>anyone of note who has accomplished a<br>lot of things I throw up a little in my<br>mouth well just be honest with you I<br>have however devised a technique to help<br>with us I get over this queasiness at<br>their achievements they success their<br>so-called dedication and I as I I just<br>lie about them that's what I do I'm<br>gonna do that here today and next time<br>you introduce someone I recommend that<br>you do to see if you can spot the lies<br>people I'd like to first introduce<br>Rachel sprung can Smurf rachel is the<br>professor and higher education and she<br>is also the Dean of the Graduate<br>research school<br>she has past head of the Higher<br>Education Development Center where she<br>worked as an academic staff developer<br>she initially trained as a geographer<br>and she first worked as a research<br>meteorologist or one of those with the<br>girls I think you were weren't you<br>Rachel she did her PhD in geography at<br>the University of British Columbia<br>specializing in urban climatology and<br>then she lectured at the University of<br>Kent abri and geography before moving<br>into higher education and coming down to<br>Otago Rachel came to the Graduate<br>research school in 2012 and I remember<br>it like it was yesterday<br>as Dean of the Graduate research school<br>she works on policy helps support in<br>graduate research students making sure<br>supervisors are occasionally there on a<br>Friday afternoon and she also still does<br>a lot of teaching and research her<br>teaching and particular has been<br>recognized with teaching awards at both<br>the University of Canterbury the<br>University of Otago and at the national<br>level as well she has won a sustained<br>excellence in teaching award at the New<br>Zealand level and in 2016 she won the<br>turns herds a medal for sustained<br>contribution to the research environment<br>in New Zealand she gained a Fulbright<br>Scholar Award and<br>for research on PhD education she's<br>heading to the u.s. in 2018 so when<br>Rachel takes up her Fulbright next year<br>she will be investigating new modes of<br>doctoral research primarily she'll be<br>exploring the pedagogy of pick apart<br>PhDs pick the path PhDs<br>it's going to be great she's also<br>working on thesis by meme that will be<br>fantastic to see to Rachel and finally<br>she's going to be investigating the use<br>of subliminal advertising in the<br>master's thesis trying to work in with<br>the arms industry I understand<br>welcome Rachel it's lovely to have you<br>here today the next one I am going to<br>introduce as our esteemed professor<br>Richard Blakey Richard is the deputy<br>vice-chancellor research at Enterprise<br>here at OU Tago he is also a professor<br>in physics he received his BS eons from<br>Otago a long time ago Richard I won't<br>say it to embarrass you a long time ago<br>and then he went on to do a PhD in<br>Cambridge he was a visiting scientist at<br>the Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory<br>investigating single electron transport<br>effects and semiconductor nano<br>structures rather you than me he<br>returned to New Zealand in 1993 to take<br>up a position at Canterbury University<br>he was also the director of the<br>McDermott Institute prior to coming down<br>to Oh Tago<br>he has been bestowed with many honors<br>and awards honestly it is incredibly<br>tedious to go through them I will<br>mention a few though he has received the<br>tpsid medal the Hector memorial medal<br>the Thomas medal for science leadership<br>and as deputy vice vice chancellor<br>finally Richard is in charge of all<br>research and commercialization<br>activities at Otago currently Richard is<br>thinking small<br>in moving from nanotechnology to pico<br>technology<br>good man he's walking the walk of<br>commercialization as well he's working<br>on a collaboration with<br>Golden Books series introducing the<br>world of physics to toddlers look out<br>for soon-to-be classics such as items I<br>can't see them I just pretend they're<br>there and physics no one knows how to<br>spell it let alone do it nice work thank<br>you very much Richard it's lovely to<br>have you here finally Craig Mead from<br>Natural History New Zealand Craig Mead<br>as an executive producer and him and his<br>production team at NH NZ are some of the<br>most successful and prolific producers<br>of wildlife and natural history programs<br>in the world there have been more than<br>50 wildlife shows completed in the last<br>four years I think I've watched more<br>than 50 wildlife shows in the last four<br>years so I'm doing equally as well as<br>you Craig<br>anyway after 30 years of writing and<br>directing Craig still doesn't class<br>himself as a wildlife filmmaker he is a<br>science communicator that prefers mud<br>teeth tents and mosquitos to<br>laboratories when he's not making films<br>Craig as a deer hunter in an uncle an<br>on-call firefighter Craig has been<br>involved in the production of shows for<br>National Geographic the Discovery<br>Channel and Fox international Craig has<br>been quoted as saying that predator<br>predators with big nashi teeth that<br>commit large-scale violence with other<br>animals really pull the ratings they<br>also seem to do well in presidential<br>elections too however in the new current<br>socio-economic climate he sees an urgent<br>need to move to a more gentle wildlife<br>documentary he's starting a new branch<br>of Natural History called unnatural<br>history he's bitching soon to be<br>classics as everyone has an aunt that<br>looks like a badger sloths Swift<br>compared to a stone haiku parrots and<br>finally and controversially a town and<br>gown crossover called PBRs portfolios<br>not just for humans<br>thank you very much for being here Craig<br>I think your career might have peaked<br>somewhat earlier than this this period<br>anyway enough of all that it was lovely<br>to have the judges here it's lovely to<br>have you here and it's lovely to have<br>the contestants here so we'll get on<br>with the real show I'll tell you a<br>little bit about the three minute thesis<br>and then we'll hand over okay the prizes<br>the winning PhD candidate will go on to<br>compete in the 2017 asia-pacific 3mt<br>competition in Queensland that will be<br>on Friday the 29th of September and I'm<br>sure that there will be live-streamed<br>for us to watch to the winning masters<br>candidate will go on to compete in the<br>New Zealand into University Challenge at<br>Victoria and there is to be held later<br>in this month the rules of the game and<br>this is incredibly important<br>there is one static single PowerPoint<br>slide there is it nothing else no more<br>no rules no ease no buzzy things just<br>the one static slide no additional<br>electronic media although you are<br>allowed to use a microphone thankfully<br>no additional props no costumes no funny<br>heads nothing like that no magic tricks<br>no laboratory equipment quite right<br>presentations are limited to three<br>minutes in three minutes only maximum<br>once that buzzer rings or bell we thank<br>you say no more<br>okay all right that bell goes and you<br>speak there's a disqualification<br>presentations are to be spoken word no<br>singing or rapping no limericks sadly<br>but it will still be good presentations<br>that commence from the stage this is the<br>stage presentations are considered to<br>have commenced when a presenter starts<br>speaking through or either moving in a<br>way to indicate that their presentation<br>has started the judging criteria is on<br>communication style comprehension and<br>engagement we're looking to see how you<br>can communicate to a lay audience about<br>your passion your area of interest<br>we have the timekeeper Susan Craig she<br>will be holding up<br>ray and she will be pressing that button<br>but she's not gonna need to press that<br>one okay judges will give feedback after<br>each individual presentation I will run<br>up to them with this one microphone not<br>that I'm bitter and I will try not to<br>trip up when I come back down okay so<br>that's what's going to be happening<br>there we have 11 finalists 8 PhD and 3<br>contestants ready audience ready come<br>saying more with less is hard taking an<br>average speaking time of 150 words per<br>minute your standard PhD candidate would<br>require over 11 hours to read out their<br>PhD and that's not taking into account<br>footnotes appendices or toilet breaks<br>the average masters would take 4 and a<br>half hours this lot have got three<br>minutes to explain their work no<br>pressure guys I know you're up to the<br>task let's all give everyone a big huge<br>right I would like to welcome chittim ah<br>ahem Chia butl chin amar is doing a PhD<br>in population health and Christchurch<br>her area of interest is the lived<br>experiences of internally displaced<br>women in northern Nigeria take it away<br>when you're ready good evening everyone<br>just imagine attending a family<br>get-together on Christmas and suddenly<br>you begin to hear gunshots and you<br>become aware that terrorists have<br>overrun your community although you<br>managed to escape many of your family<br>members are killed what happened in your<br>family what happened in your community<br>is making headlines but nobody has ever<br>given you the opportunity to tell your<br>own story how will you feel presently<br>Nigeria is undergoing a period of armed<br>conflict Boko Haram an Islamic extremist<br>group is determined to topple the<br>Nigerian government and as a result of<br>the conflicts about hundred thousand<br>people have died and more than 2 million<br>people 80% of whom are women and<br>children have been displaced but much of<br>what we know about these displaced<br>women's experiences are from media<br>reports so what I have done is to make<br>myself available as an empathetic<br>listener to give these women the<br>opportunity to tell their own stories<br>and they told me how their husbands were<br>killed in their presence and how their<br>boys and girls were abducted by Boko<br>Haram and how they gave back to babies<br>and the bushes and left them there to<br>die because they could not take care of<br>them and how they are under pressure to<br>give birth to more children because many<br>of the children they fled with died and<br>the ones they have now as sick the<br>privilege of listening to these stories<br>is also a call for action on my part so<br>for a start<br>I'm doing a critical analysis of these<br>women stories I am looking beyond the<br>surface to uncover some historical<br>social and cultural factors that have<br>underpinned these experiences and how<br>these women interprets them in order to<br>gain some understanding of what is going<br>on for example what is making headlines<br>all over the world is that Boko Haram<br>abducted 276 schoolgirls and the whole<br>world is reacting to this but according<br>to these women they have doctored boys<br>too<br>they killed the men and what does this<br>mean to these women in the Nigerian<br>culture if you abduct girls well it is<br>bad but if you abduct boys and kill men<br>you have destroyed the community and<br>it's as if you have taken the security<br>of these women away and we need to pay<br>attention to these things these are some<br>of the neurons is among covering in my<br>analysis and when I am done I'll be able<br>to work with the Nigerian government to<br>come up with solutions for these remains<br>Thank You honorific judge Jimmy de that<br>was excellent what you did very very<br>well was put us in the place immediately<br>with the Megan and drew us into the the<br>narrative that you had you were perfect<br>a time and gave us a very very good<br>overview of of what your thesis is if I<br>was going to suggest improvements it<br>might be to just have a little bit more<br>time thinking about the the outcomes<br>rather that was quite brief at the end<br>in terms of what the outcomes of the<br>research might lead to<br>but overall outstanding thank you very<br>much Cheatham up as a storyteller what I<br>appreciated most in that was your<br>department your energy your tone your<br>seriousness all conveyed what that story<br>was going to be about before you've<br>gotten very far into it so you kind of<br>embodied it very nicely sometimes the<br>teller of a story doesn't actually carry<br>the tone of the story as well but you<br>did a great job with that it's a big<br>story to take a bite out of to explain<br>and I think you did a great job it left<br>me wanting more and on certain level<br>that's the point on another level it's<br>not the point in this competition I<br>thought it was wonderful thank you<br>thanks to my great homage there very<br>confronting research again a terrific<br>story drawing us under that really<br>appreciated that and I also like hearing<br>about how you were doing the research<br>and like Richard just wanted to know a<br>bit more about of course only three<br>minutes so terrific job thinking<br>next up it is my pleasure to introduce<br>Severin F Prasad he is doing a PhD in<br>all Sciences in the Faculty of Dentistry<br>at you<br>and you are doing the smart project and<br>I've said enough about that so I'm gonna<br>say over to you what is the one thing<br>that you didn't forget to carry when you<br>left your homes in the morning today<br>your keys yes your wallet yes and your<br>smartphone almost surely yes even if you<br>did forget the first two right well it's<br>not just you two-thirds of adults in New<br>Zealand now own or have access to a<br>smartphone and then numbers are<br>dramatically increasing smartphones can<br>now tell you how well you slept<br>yesterday how many steps you walk today<br>or even how fast my heart is beating<br>doing this 3-minute talk but I want you<br>to wait for a moment and spare a thought<br>for the computer operator on long term<br>sick leave due to work-related neck and<br>facial muscle pain or the teacher who<br>lost three or four ten thousand dollar<br>dental implants due to muscle<br>dysfunction now typically what would<br>happen is the teacher and the computer<br>operator would have a detailed but<br>subjective clinical assessment of their<br>muscles and also a lab based assessment<br>for accuracy of these muscles with<br>equipment that is presently bulky wired<br>and would restrict movements during<br>recordings until now this prevented an<br>assessment of muscle behavior and<br>function as it happens in a natural<br>setting outside the confines of a lab<br>will not anymore as we have now<br>successfully developed and tested a mini<br>h of frigid spinner shaped device that<br>can detect and wirelessly transmit<br>muscle activity data to your smartphone<br>continuously for up to two days what<br>this means is you sitting over there on<br>your smartphone can visualize the<br>activity of my muscles<br>as I speak right here right now but you<br>don't want to be trusting those signals<br>as yet do you you want to make sure<br>whether those signals are telling you<br>how strong how long and how often my<br>muscles are contracting in other words<br>you want to be making sure that the<br>device is accurately telling and<br>measuring what it's supposed to be<br>measuring to answer these questions what<br>we are doing now in the smart study is<br>we are recording from the same muscle at<br>the same time simultaneously with a<br>wired and the new wireless device the<br>signals generated are then being<br>superimposed to see the extent of match<br>between these signals to validate the<br>device and my friends the initial<br>preliminary results have been very<br>encouraging moving forwards enabling<br>internet connectivity to this device is<br>what we are looking at this will then<br>help in remote monitoring of muscle<br>activity which will then help in sending<br>timely biofeedback to the smartphone's<br>of the teacher and the computer operator<br>based on which they can take corrective<br>measures to ease their muscle pain pain<br>may not be an option but suffering<br>thank you that sounds fascinating I was<br>waiting for why you got to why which is<br>great probably for me the lay person<br>hitting why in the first 20 seconds<br>would be ideal but you got there and it<br>was a clearly understood why so I<br>thanks very much<br>great presentation I like the way you<br>started by making it relevant to<br>listeners and terms that we could see<br>what the technology was we've all got<br>smart home phones and in good use of<br>humor too so thinking yes getting very<br>very good very polished very confident<br>presentation I like the image to me it<br>talks nicely about that I can always<br>refer back to the timeline of the<br>project and again a really good<br>narrative technique a trick of asking a<br>question at the start to get people<br>engaged with your talk so very very good<br>thinking<br>I tell you what though you don't want to<br>see Maya but my muscles are doing by any<br>smartphone device so you really don't<br>and Maya pulse was about 98 thank you<br>okay next up here's my pleasure to<br>introduce Alex Alex Wilson is doing a<br>master's in music theater and performing<br>arts and humanities<br>alex is going to be talking about his<br>thesis which is fog of war British<br>theatrical responses to the 2003<br>invasion of Iraq in a post truce<br>political environment take it away<br>please Alex why did the Coalition of the<br>Willing invade Iraq in 2003 if I took a<br>survey of this room I would get<br>innumerable answers and most of those<br>answers would be correct and incorrect<br>at the same time in the leader to the<br>invasion we're told many things by<br>politicians that Iraq had weapons of<br>mass destruction that Iraq had links to<br>9/11 that Iraq represented a threat to<br>the entire world these statements were<br>questioned and these statements were<br>repeated evidence was asked for and<br>evidence was fabricated these statements<br>were disproved these statements were<br>maintained Iraq was invaded half a<br>million Iraqis lost their lives and an<br>entire region was destabilized<br>destabilized even now in 2017 we have no<br>real idea why the invasion happened all<br>we know is that we were kept in the dark<br>by an administration who instead of<br>providing a dominant narrative about<br>what was going on decided it was best to<br>exploit the fog of war by providing a<br>series of contradictory statements this<br>of course is nothing new is happened<br>time and time again simply look at the<br>behavior of Donald Trump so words then<br>are weapons of mass destruction they can<br>not only destroy lives but they can<br>destroy truth meaning and critical<br>thought this of course presents a<br>problem for political playwrights who<br>depend on their words to not only<br>critique politicians in their views but<br>to present political ideas of their own<br>so but if they did this if a player I<br>did this well they're just presenting<br>their own version of the truth and<br>doesn't that make them just as bad as a<br>politician they're trying to critique so<br>my thesis is not only looking at how<br>we're playwrights have depicted the<br>invasion of Iraq but also how they've<br>depicted truth in an environment where<br>truth is increasingly more pliable these<br>changes broadly fall in line with the<br>views expressed by Harold Pinter who<br>said their play rights should be trying<br>to point out what the truth is but how<br>the truth functions<br>he says when we look into a mirror we<br>think that the image they confront us is<br>accurate but if we moved but a<br>millimeter of the image changes so we're<br>looking at an infinite range of<br>reflections and appendices a playwright<br>should smash through this mirror because<br>it's on the other side that the truth<br>stares at us we may never know why Iraq<br>was invaded or why politicians do<br>anything but for playwrights to make<br>more truthful more ethical work they<br>should be trying to fill in these gaps<br>now knowledged but rather point to how<br>excellently for Alex love the image<br>thought it was very fitting and I also<br>like the play on words around weapons or<br>words of mass destruction good great<br>message yes again very very good Alex<br>and again you've done a good thing to me<br>you've left me with the phrase that I<br>didn't come in the room with words are<br>weapons of mass destruction<br>you used the stage that you have in<br>front of you I was still though lift<br>with her what's your contribution to<br>this it's a big topic but with in your<br>master's thesis I have or I will that<br>was still worth a piece that I had<br>missing at the end of it I think it's an<br>important conversation to have and that<br>was great to hear about it and you did<br>it with all our confidence which speaks<br>to me about the quality of your work I<br>don't know about that harold pinter he's<br>wrong about the mirror when I look in<br>the mirror I see a middle-aged<br>overweight woman it can't be the case is<br>so absolutely insane I will smash<br>through it quite right okay up next we<br>have half a la Habana she is doing a PhD<br>for the College of Education and her<br>area is exploring the discourses of<br>social investment in the oil and gas<br>sector take it away when you're really<br>her forever thank you so I want to take<br>you on a journey to that place and I<br>want you to imagine yourself wearing<br>this orange large jumper heavy boots in<br>a white helmet you are in the muddy<br>noisy tearing surrounded by heavy<br>machinery but also by trees clear water<br>strings and animals a variety of animals<br>now we are going to visit a traditional<br>community of the Brazilian Amazon that<br>lives minutes away you will see that<br>they are reach of food and culture but<br>they're also very isolated and because<br>of this they've been deprived of the<br>basic Health and Social Care Services<br>this is where I worked I used to work<br>with the communities that lived near oil<br>and gas operations as you can imagine<br>oil and gas operations hugely impact the<br>life of those who live nearby but how to<br>compensate for such impacts well oil and<br>gas companies often use social<br>investment as a way of compensation and<br>my role was to implement social<br>investment and I faced several dilemmas<br>trying to do it for example I used to<br>believe the company should provide<br>communities with a basic health service<br>why not<br>we had the means and the resources right<br>well little did I know that when the<br>operation seized so as social investment<br>would was it right to take away from the<br>community the basic health service they<br>need it dilemmas like that made me<br>pursue a PhD<br>in oil and gas social investment I<br>wanted to know whether other people that<br>did the same job I did faced similar<br>dilemmas and I wanted to know how they<br>solved those dilemmas so I interviewed<br>2000 and gas experts from 11 countries<br>and they taught me that social<br>investment may actually harm people if<br>it raises communities dependency upon<br>the oil and gas resources I have also<br>learned that these experts are in a very<br>complex position because they have to<br>deal with different and often<br>conflicting expectations of social<br>investment from the community the<br>company the government in their own and<br>this can be a very tricky place to be in<br>now when I imagine myself going back to<br>that muddy and noisy tearing I know that<br>social investment and impact<br>compensation actions are different<br>things and they should be treated<br>differently I also know that social<br>investment cannot be a substitute to the<br>government my PhD at the Otago<br>University with Karen and viv has given<br>me an alternative lens to look at social<br>investment and I hope it does the same<br>to others who want to understand or work<br>with social investment in the oil and<br>Thank You Raphael are you in the fan<br>club prize so far and again it's very<br>clear while you're we are all here you<br>look very all very practice and<br>articulate and that I want to take you<br>on a journey as a good good way to start<br>I will leave my other judges to also<br>give you praise there's a lot to praise<br>just in terms of if you go through<br>further a little bit of voice practice<br>to get their diction up and just though<br>the strength of your voice might need a<br>little bit of an improvement okay thank<br>you<br>you just delivered the perfect narrative<br>that had the beginning the middle and<br>the end it had the complication where<br>it's supposed to have the complication<br>it had the resolution and the discovery<br>so that was well handed it takes a lot<br>of thought and planning to do that and<br>I'm very impressed thank you I really<br>enjoyed the opening story early<br>transported us under that setting and we<br>learned about your motivation for the<br>research and like craigers see it it<br>really took us through the whole story<br>to the end and the implications so great<br>job thank you thank you<br>that's lost country Craig yeah it's<br>next up we have Andrew Mills Andrew is<br>doing his PhD in psychology he is<br>exploring capturing crimes on camera hmm<br>let's just move out of the camera when<br>you are absolutely really take it away<br>Andrew have you ever witnessed a crime<br>maybe you've seen a handbag snatched in<br>a crowd<br>or watched a fight turn nasty late on a<br>Saturday night if you see a crime occur<br>chances are you'll need to talk to the<br>police about what happened you might<br>even be called up as a witness in court<br>if this happens your ability to<br>accurately remember the event becomes<br>crucial a couple of decades ago the only<br>tool to help you achieve there was your<br>brain but nowadays witnesses to crimes<br>are often armed with smartphones they<br>can instantly capture their surroundings<br>in HD I'm interested in how these<br>wonders of modern technology might help<br>or hinder Criminal Investigations so<br>could taking a photo<br>help us to remember a crime maybe taking<br>a photo focuses our attention something<br>we know build stronger and better<br>memories but there's another possibility<br>taking a photo could actually impair<br>memory because we're outsourcing our<br>memory relying on the camera to remember<br>for us and that's exactly what recent<br>research has suggested there people on a<br>museum tour were less likely to remember<br>exhibits if they've taken photos now I<br>began my PhD with lofty plans to study<br>that particular effect further to work<br>out what made it tick if you like but no<br>matter what I tried I couldn't get the<br>same effect in science we call this<br>failure to replicate although as a PhD<br>student I tried to focus too much of the<br>failure path because after all if you've<br>taken a photo of a crime then okay<br>what your memory is like you've got a<br>photo what's actually more likely though<br>is that people will have photos of the<br>event with a crime took place but not<br>the crime itself for example the Castle<br>Street local my head photos of a couch<br>on fire but none of the fire lighting<br>culprit so what I want to know is<br>whether taking photos could have fixed<br>other aspects of memory one likely<br>contender is confident to investigate<br>this I show people a movie of a flat<br>warming and have them take selected<br>photos as they watch later on I<br>carefully interview these participants<br>asking about two crimes that occurred at<br>the party we hypothesized that by taking<br>a photo participants would become<br>overconfident in their memory even if<br>their photos don't show anything useful<br>now most of the time overconfidence<br>isn't so bad annoying but not harmful<br>but overconfidence and a witness is a<br>big problem very confident witnesses<br>tend to guess more when they're<br>interviewed and they tend to be rated by<br>judges and jurors is more accurate so<br>that's very map - now my research could<br>help inform investigators about the<br>risks posed by competent witnesses and<br>for you having my research will give you<br>pause for thought the next time you<br>reach<br>that's quite on the cutting edge of the<br>world we live in<br>look it's left me with a lot to think<br>about actually just that three minutes<br>alone has fired up a number of questions<br>in my head I might want to ask you about<br>one day so I think in that level you've<br>done your job<br>I felt that perhaps the subject of the<br>talk meandered a little bit but it's got<br>me keen and wanting to hear more so<br>thank you thanks Andrew I really like<br>your engaging body language and the<br>rapport the audience I thought yet so<br>you know that fascinating topic we've<br>got to come back next year and tell us<br>what the results are yes I enjoyed this<br>very much again humour is good so again<br>you got us you got us engaged with with<br>a laugh a couple of times and again not<br>all of these three minute theses are at<br>the end so you you made that clear of<br>that's where I am up to now that was a<br>very good marker that you haven't<br>reached the point of being able to<br>describe what the in results are so that<br>was good - mark vet very clearly for us<br>thank you very much thank you<br>thank you very much Andrew I guess we've<br>all got a problem when we've outsourced<br>our memories so much that we forget to<br>take out our cameras right next up we<br>have Josie Cairns<br>Josie is doing a master's in geography<br>she is looking at investigations and to<br>soil moisture attenuation in a natural<br>soil when you are ready Josie you go<br>home you turn the tap on water comes out<br>if you're in Dunedin where's that would<br>have come from it comes from places like<br>this this is my field site it's called<br>Glen do it's just outside of Lawrence<br>some of you maybe have been there soil<br>moisture is about linking different<br>process of the hydrosphere hydrosphere<br>sorry if you think about hydrology<br>usually we're thinking about rivers<br>we're thinking about the water that we<br>can see that water comes from somewhere<br>there's a process that goes from the<br>rain coming down it hits the ground and<br>something happens there and that's soil<br>moisture so what I'm looking at is soil<br>moisture attenuation that's talking<br>about changes and the distribution of<br>soil moisture at depth so we can see<br>I've got made from DUPLO on the<br>left-hand side of my slide they're a<br>soil profile now I've made it from DUPLO<br>because it's kind of hard to photograph<br>and we can look at the different levels<br>there as part of my Master's at the<br>field site I have a set of six<br>instruments at depth in the soil profile<br>so basically at each of those titles<br>that I've got I've got an instrument<br>that measures the percentage of<br>volumetric water content that says how<br>much water is here simultaneously I<br>measure the amount of precipitation<br>that's coming through so what I can see<br>is the amount of water that's coming<br>through and how fast it moves through<br>that soil profile now that's interesting<br>to me but why is that interesting to you<br>it's interesting because it connects an<br>extra stage of the hydrosphere that we<br>don't know a lot about before this study<br>the main sites that we were using the<br>background that I've been looking at is<br>based on<br>maximum of 12 weeks of data most of the<br>studies that have been done in New<br>Zealand have individual discrete events<br>so someone will go out and they will<br>sample once or maybe twice<br>hopefully over a period of weeks I have<br>11 months of continuous data at 5-minute<br>intervals so you compare what's already<br>out there 12 days perhaps 12 weeks of<br>data to what I already have for a<br>masters which is 11 continuous months<br>what this does is it provides much<br>greater understanding to be able to link<br>these processes in the future will be<br>able to put this sort of data into a<br>model and build a conceptualization of<br>where our water is coming from it will<br>help to preserve these grasslands which<br>then will preserve the water that we<br>need to drink now many of you hopefully<br>will remember a precipitation event that<br>happened about three weeks ago the river<br>flooded some people's houses flooded at<br>my field site there was a hundred and<br>fifty millimeters of rain occurring over<br>30 hours that's a lot for those of you<br>that don't know and for the soil<br>moisture at the top 10 centimeters so<br>that's at the houmous lair those soil<br>moisture was increased for five days to<br>54 percent as opposed to a usual average<br>of 20% over the rest of the 11 months<br>thank you<br>thanks Josie of course I love the<br>geography in there but great relevance<br>to us and good setting the scene<br>I felt you did answer but too much of<br>the slide could have kept you no contact<br>with the audience more but a good story<br>wanted to hear more about other things<br>yes agreed<br>good engagement again it's a it's a<br>technical topic but it's Skinner you you<br>linked more than once back to back to<br>what we have in our daily life and<br>actually incorporating the recent event<br>is very good and I you must know<br>something about our MCU now with us who<br>who is a lego person now whether you've<br>done any harm or any good by using DUPLO<br>I'm not sure the discussion lately that<br>was really good I was doing it I would<br>start off with we don't know where our<br>water comes from because the second<br>people grasp that they understand the<br>journey you're taking it was in there<br>but just hit them in the face with in<br>the first sentence but that was really<br>interesting and I'm looking forward to<br>I'm for any kind of building blocks<br>actually yeah so that'sthat's all good<br>thank you very much<br>right next up we have Nicola Bateson<br>Nicola is doing a PhD in accountancy in<br>finance her talk and thesis is on<br>confidence matters when you're ready<br>Nicola please start I started my<br>literature review when I was four years<br>old I was given the book the little<br>engine that could and I was fascinated<br>by the story for those of you that don't<br>know it's about the smallest engine and<br>the yard given the job of taking the<br>toys over the hill to the children<br>waiting on the other side as he goes up<br>the hill it gets harder and harder and<br>harder and he says to himself I think I<br>can I think I can I think I can and of<br>course eventually makes it to the<br>children and delivers the toys so how<br>does this relate to my PhD well it<br>started a lifelong fascination with<br>self-efficacy or confidence I've always<br>been interested in this idea of self<br>belief in its power so when I had to<br>choose a PhD topic I was teaching<br>accounting at the time - first years I<br>thought I want to investigate the role<br>of self-efficacy with an accounting<br>education now I'm going to tell you<br>something at this point that might shock<br>you not all students want to learn<br>accounting in fact accounting as a<br>discipline has often seen as a little<br>bit dull who knew and yet all students<br>learning about business need to know at<br>least a little bit of accounting before<br>they graduate some students want to be<br>there they're excited it's interesting<br>other students well they see it as dull<br>boring and hard but they all have to be<br>there it's not optional so what I've<br>done is I've surveyed thousands of<br>students across multiple semesters at<br>two different universities all enrolled<br>in a first-year accounting course I've<br>asked them about their level of<br>self-efficacy with different aspects of<br>the course such as how comfy<br>are you worth asking for help from your<br>lecturers for studying for the exam<br>organizing your notes what about how<br>confident are you to pass the exam and<br>what I've found is that their level of<br>self-efficacy to do with the academic<br>success is actually the most powerful<br>predictor of whether they do succeed in<br>the course over and above all of the<br>other variables that I gather data on<br>including whether that done accounting<br>at high school or not meaning that<br>self-efficacy is more powerful than<br>prior learning in this context which is<br>really cool for me because it means I've<br>taken this well-established theory<br>brought it in and shown that it holds in<br>an accounting education space but<br>excitingly it also has a practical<br>contribution for learning and teaching<br>accounting because it doesn't matter if<br>you think it is dull boring or hard what<br>really matters at the end of the day is<br>whether you think you can<br>wasn't me first Oh what do I have to say<br>it lots and lots I love for image I<br>begin ambiguity is is something I live<br>by now I'm just not sure whether you're<br>your balance sheet is quite correctly so<br>you might just have to pick two the<br>numbers no I think that was that was<br>wonderful and I was I was making the<br>comment what can we do about it when you<br>get into the end we just win you answer<br>the question that I started to form so<br>that was very good in terms of<br>explaining what you've been studying<br>what you want to learn what you've<br>discovered and why it's important that<br>was the entire package I thought it'd<br>work lovely thank you thank you<br>great job knuckler years again you may<br>and I thought I love the opening story<br>to one that most of us be familiar with<br>and I love the way you came back to that<br>at the end so it really was the whole<br>package well done<br>that woman is living a lie oh yeah we<br>are all living a life right okey-dokey<br>next up we have a deal act now a deal is<br>doing a PhD in management and his thesis<br>is on reducing unnecessary suffering<br>through healthcare design in using Lean<br>Thinking in your own time hi everyone<br>I'm here to talk about a service that we<br>are all deeply connected with the health<br>care service and the health care<br>services its fair share of dysfunctions<br>two magics excellence of course and<br>these dysfunctions play are based around<br>three factors cost quality and capacity<br>and all in all these dysfunctions bring<br>a lot of unnecessary pain and suffering<br>to the people and the patients and<br>sometimes even result in their deaths<br>which is really unfortunate and if you<br>think about that these misfortunes these<br>misfortune events like this they don't<br>happen because of bad medicine we've got<br>the back the best medicine our species<br>ever got and we're making it even better<br>and better by putting the best minds<br>onto it<br>these misfortunate events happen because<br>of the bad service design the reason<br>behind it is very simple because health<br>care was designed with diseases at its<br>center and not the people which is to<br>say of course it was poorly designed and<br>nowhere are the effects of bad design<br>more heartbreaking and opportunities for<br>good design more compelling than in<br>health care but it is not all bad news<br>they still hope a lot is going on in the<br>health care sector in terms of the<br>redesign and one of the basic principle<br>methodologies used to deliver that we<br>design is called Lean Thinking which is<br>a management philosophy forged in the<br>factories of Toyota and it became the<br>primary success for Toyota's primary<br>reason for Toyota's success but the<br>problem is that Lean Thinking is a very<br>foreign concept in in healthcare its<br>core idea is to link individual<br>processes human<br>activities and operations of an<br>organization to deliver more value to<br>the customers while reducing the waste<br>and while in other industries the<br>definition of waste is always related to<br>monetary things I believe I personally<br>believe in health care the definition of<br>waste should be related to this<br>unnecessary pain and suffering that we<br>have to go through and this is where I<br>come in I'm looking into New Zealand DHB<br>is implementing lean thinking at micro<br>details levels to see whether and how<br>this foreign concept can actually help<br>to create safer patient journeys and how<br>the people inside the healthcare sector<br>can actually learn about this foreign<br>concept understand it better and adopt<br>or adapted to suit their needs to create<br>a better and safer healthcare system for<br>all of us thank you very much<br>a deal thank you how bet ODT wants to<br>interview you this evening I actually<br>didn't know what Lean Thinking was until<br>I sat down heard your talk but the<br>second you started explaining I fully<br>got it sound it looked like you were<br>thinking a bit about what had to come<br>next what had to come next what had to<br>come next just watching your eyes and<br>probably a few more repetitions and<br>you'll be past that but that was<br>informative it made me want to learn<br>more and made me want to see you in the<br>paper tomorrow thanks to do a great<br>presentation I at first I thought that<br>slide was a bit busy there was a lot on<br>there but actually it was a really nice<br>map of what you talked about so I did<br>enjoy that visual and obviously great<br>practical relevance I think's for me<br>thank you yes thanks a deal I also<br>enjoyed the slide particularly there's a<br>little reference about another brick in<br>the wall and it brings me to some<br>something that I had as a musical<br>interest in my earlier days but good<br>again it again it heads of this topic a<br>question of what can you learn from<br>making motor vehicles about making<br>people better so I wish you all the best<br>for your research<br>I hadn't heard of lean thinking either<br>I'm all for it as long as you keep it<br>out of my dinner right next up it noir<br>miked up as Deanna Beckett Deanna is<br>doing a masters and preventive and<br>social medicine in the Health Sciences<br>Division and her thesis is on<br>incorporating economic evaluation into<br>oral health related quality of life<br>measure for children dental diseases are<br>the most prevalent chronic diseases<br>worldwide with an estimated 2.4 billion<br>people globally suffering from untreated<br>dental decay alone but what does that<br>actually mean take a look at the image<br>of this young woman she has dental decay<br>that has spread to the nerve and blood<br>supply of her tooth the tooth has died<br>and become infected the infection is<br>spread through drained out of the root<br>of the tooth and is pulling into the<br>side of her mouth that is why her face<br>is swollen at the top you can see<br>untreated dental decay it doesn't look<br>good it doesn't smell good and it's<br>often painful if your teeth or mouth<br>look like this it is not easy to eat<br>sleep or concentrate people make<br>judgments and this impacts on the way<br>that you're treated now in New Zealand<br>if you have a sore throat or the<br>sniffles<br>you can go and see your GP and your<br>treatment is subsidised but if you have<br>teeth like this and you're over the age<br>of 18 there is no government funding and<br>that means that unless you have the<br>money to pay for private dental care<br>there is nothing you can do about it and<br>that is not okay so how do government's<br>decide how to split the health dollar if<br>you had to decide between treating one<br>person with cancer or 20 people with<br>tonsils getting their tonsils out what<br>would you do to make this process as<br>fair and transparent as possible many<br>governments are relying on economic<br>evaluation<br>one method is using a quality-of-life<br>questionnaire with an algorithm that can<br>calculate a quality adjusted life year<br>or quali a quali is a unit of benefit<br>measurement that considers not just the<br>cost of treatment but the length of your<br>life and the quality of your life is<br>what these guys need to help them make<br>really big decisions there are currently<br>no oral health related quality of life<br>questionnaires with their algorithm that<br>can calculate a quali<br>and that puts us on the backfoot when<br>trying to make a case for funding my<br>research is looking at how we can get<br>that quali I conduct a dental<br>examinations for 87 people and gave each<br>of them to quality of life<br>questionnaires to complete one was oral<br>health Pacific and the other was generic<br>I wanted to know whether or not the<br>general health measure with the<br>algorithm was reading the same as the<br>oral health measure and whether or not<br>it was sensitive to actual oral health<br>status because if so we have something<br>tangible that shows government oral<br>health is important people are suffering<br>they need and deserve treatment and at<br>the least it should be subsidized<br>thinking<br>thanks Deanna I I like the way you draw<br>asunder that in terms of giving us some<br>facts about the prevalence of these<br>problems great images too very powerful<br>I want to find out more about it which<br>is obviously the point of these talks so<br>well done yes thanks Deanna again you<br>use the you use the full width of your<br>stage and your gestures with good<br>pointing us to the image while you were<br>remaining engaged with us again I liked<br>it had some specifics again you often<br>leading with numbers at the start of<br>however many million people is good but<br>you did a really good thing I've been<br>grounding about and what does it<br>actually mean so a lot of very very good<br>techniques here thank you very much yeah<br>I felt like you didn't need three<br>minutes you pretty much had that done in<br>a minute and a half we understood we<br>understood why it was important and the<br>rest was elaboration and that means<br>you've done a great job of encapsulating<br>all your work and what it's about and<br>why so very well done thank you<br>look at what I have to go and work with<br>five days a week to take so much valium<br>to go into that dental school right next<br>up we have Ellie Mae Jarvis Ellie Mae is<br>doing a PhD in pathology in molecular<br>medicine from Wellington and her thesis<br>topic is profile and profiling innate<br>like t-cells and cancer in your own time<br>Ellie Mae your everyone as you may know<br>those diagnosed with cancer in the later<br>stages are more likely to die from their<br>cancer and this is because their<br>diagnosis comes well after the cancer<br>has spread throughout their body and<br>unfortunately this means that our<br>standard treatments are less effective<br>so we need to offer them something new<br>and that something is anti-cancer<br>immunotherapies so these are medicines<br>that target the body's own immune system<br>and they specialized it into killing<br>cancer so to develop a good<br>immunotherapy we need to be able to<br>drive a good t-cell response t-cells are<br>your basi immune cells they tell all the<br>other immune cells what to do how to<br>kill the cancer and they're also quite<br>good at killing the cancer themselves<br>but not all t-cells are created equally<br>and we're especially interested in the<br>innate like t-cells so these are your<br>t-cells they do all the same things<br>they're just faster they're generally<br>better and there's much more of them so<br>you get a much better anti-cancer immune<br>response however there are many<br>different ways to use an eight like two<br>cells to treat cancer for example<br>imagine it's your friend's birthday and<br>you've been asked by them to make them<br>something and there are any<br>specifications are to make it chocolatey<br>so there are a number of different<br>things you could make so let's let's<br>make a brownie and there are a number of<br>different recipes you could use but this<br>one will do so you melt the butter you<br>add the sugar you sift the flour and<br>then no eggs this is kind of like how we<br>make anti-cancer immunotherapies we<br>spend years developing something we put<br>it into people and in the clinical trial<br>and see if it works<br>well we don't stop to check what their<br>existing immune response is like<br>it would be much smarter like when<br>cooking for our friend if we actually<br>cheek to see what we had first right and<br>that's what I'm doing in my PhD I'm<br>taking blood from people with advanced<br>cancers and I'm looking to see whether<br>these quick bossy t-cells are still<br>present whether they're actually still<br>capable of killing cancer and whether<br>any of our current cancer treatments<br>have an effect on their function the aim<br>of versus turn from the development of a<br>night like T cell based immunotherapies<br>to treat these cancers how do we do that<br>what treatments can we use them<br>alongside and overall how do we be spend<br>all this this money that we have in<br>research to develop an effective<br>treatment so that it's not too late an<br>advanced cancer thank you thanks Ellie<br>Mae I like the way you took what was<br>obviously very complicated research and<br>made understand wolf the lay audience so<br>well done about that I now know what a<br>tea sellers are bossy immune cells so<br>thank you yes I can relate to this as<br>introduced I my research deals with<br>things that are not you can't hold in<br>your hand and are not visible so you did<br>an excellent job in using the analogy<br>the recipe and the and the imagine this<br>to get that and also you can you lead us<br>through the story of what you were doing<br>and what it may lead to so thank you<br>very much great graphics the metaphor of<br>cooking makes sense I sort of feel sorry<br>for you because you're dealing with<br>something a lot more arcane than some<br>other subjects and that means your<br>mountain is higher to climb to simplify<br>and explain but I felt like I understood<br>and I felt like I knew what the point<br>was at the end of it and why we would<br>all benefit if your work continues and<br>so I would consider that job done thank<br>you very much<br>first thing on Monday morning I'm going<br>to ask my boss to rename my job title as<br>T cell right lucky last and you must be<br>kidding me with this title of this<br>thesis gives me great pleasure to<br>welcome Aaron Dini who's doing a PhD in<br>physiology he's working on towards an<br>understanding of if AMD when you're<br>ready Adam so have you ever thought<br>about how many time today we smile<br>whether that's smiling at someone in the<br>street smiling a friend or just smiling<br>about the memory now think about if you<br>couldn't smile every day and how that<br>would make you feel this is what people<br>with fassio scapula humerus Gila<br>dystrophy have to deal with so far Co<br>scapula humeral muscular dystrophy or<br>FSHD is an inherited skeletal muscle<br>weakness and wasting disease and it<br>affects around 1 in 7,500 individuals<br>worldwide and around 20% of those<br>affected will end up wheelchair-bound<br>so this disease affects predominantly<br>the facial shoulder and arm muscles but<br>it does progress onto other muscles<br>within the body and it's characterized<br>by oxidative stress inflammation cell<br>death and a disorganization in the way<br>oscillating muscle forms so whilst there<br>is a lot of research going on into FSHD<br>it is in its infancy and was to date<br>there's no current treatments or cure<br>for FSHD the only treatments that we do<br>have within the clinic are non-steroidal<br>anti-inflammatories or athos's<br>which don't actually treat the<br>pathological consequences of the disease<br>therefore it's imperative that we<br>actually find some form of treatments<br>which is effective and can improve<br>quality of life for individuals with<br>FSHD so one thing we often do when we<br>look for these treatments is we look for<br>pharmacological thick fixes and we<br>forget about the complexity<br>of the whole disease we often also<br>forget about the complexities of the<br>human body and we look past this for<br>these pharmacological drugs when the<br>answer may actually lie within so most<br>of you will have heard about cholesterol<br>and the fact we've got both good and bad<br>cholesterol and is this good cholesterol<br>which I am investigating to see if we<br>can use this as a treatment for FSHD so<br>good cholesterol your high density<br>lipoproteins for hdls have been shown to<br>treat alleviate oxidative stress<br>inflammation and cell death three of the<br>things which are the passive the<br>characterized FSHD and our pathological<br>attend disease they've also been<br>progressed on to clinical trials in<br>humans for cardiovascular diseases so we<br>know they work so to date my research<br>has shown that HDLs can significantly<br>alleviate oxidative stress cell death<br>and this disorganization in skeletal<br>muscle which we see within FSHD and it's<br>been so profound that it's brought it<br>back to what we see in our healthy<br>skeletal muscle and we've now progressed<br>this on to a preclinical model smiling<br>is such a natural reaction that we often<br>take these things for granted this is<br>what my research aims to give back thank<br>thanks thanks Adam great image and again<br>connecting a complicated disorder to a<br>simple thing such as a smile was a very<br>very nice instrument to use again nice<br>full circle in that if I was going to be<br>critical again not critical of the of if<br>the long word and the title because you<br>did a very good job of getting to<br>abbreviation but you still had a bit of<br>jargon there you could have perhaps<br>weeded out some somehow I promise my<br>office I'd come home knowing how to say<br>that word I didn't count on the accent<br>though that was really interesting and<br>you had promising results you know you<br>understand here's the problem here's<br>what's happening inside the body here's<br>what we think here's what we're trying<br>here's what we're learning that was<br>fantastic I'm excited to hear more about<br>this I thought that was a good elevator<br>pitch literally that you got stuck in a<br>box or somebody you could bang that and<br>they know exactly what you roll about<br>and that's the job isn't it so they keep<br>thank you thanks Adam<br>very very much there I thought it was a<br>great quite clear explanation of the<br>disease and and you took us through how<br>you're researching it and what some of<br>your results are and it's clearly<br>research that's making a difference and<br>I kind of like the way that you<br>deliberately left your smile until the<br>end<br>thank you very much Adam I remain<br>convinced that nobody can say that word<br>it's a little bit like physics right<br>yeah<br>okey-dokey here's the finalists we've<br>heard from the finalists and we've seen<br>the finalists do the amazing wonderful<br>thing thank you very much for engaging<br>enjoyable and illuminating performances<br>now the pressure is on the judges so I'm<br>going to ask the judges to retire not<br>just to deliberate but just retire go<br>and make a decision make it sound follow<br>the criteria and you all can talk<br>amongst yourselves one more round of<br>drumroll it's about as good as I can<br>give for a drumroll oh nice I feel like<br>a bossy t cell awesome right I'm gonna<br>pass you to our esteemed DVC Richard and<br>now me he knew icky okoto guitar on<br>behalf of the judges I'd like to<br>congratulate all of the finalists that<br>was outstanding you all made our job<br>very very hard because there were no bad<br>presentations you have clearly got a<br>good grounding in your subject area your<br>topics are all ones that you find<br>engaging and interesting and compelling<br>you have all been coached well to be<br>able to use those both visual and<br>presentation techniques to draw us into<br>the presentation so we did find that<br>they were all of a higher standard than<br>I think I've been judging this for a<br>number of years a higher standard that<br>I've seen overall however in saying that<br>we had to come to some decisions<br>actually I should also say what you did<br>is you made me feel inadequate I did a<br>three and a half year thesis and I<br>certainly couldn't<br>have hoped to have explained it in such<br>a timely manner we did have to come to<br>some decisions and we have done that and<br>in the Masters category we have<br>determined that the winner of the three<br>minute thesis masters category award<br>from the University of Otago for 2017 is<br>Deanna Beckett<br>and for the PhD category we do want to<br>again acknowledge the excellent<br>presentations from all of the candidates<br>but before I announce the winner I would<br>just like to give a special shout out to<br>highly commended candidates chittim ah<br>ah hum Chia boat Oh congratulations and<br>Rafael Acosta came out rubella<br>congratulations<br>you are both very very close condensers<br>to our overall winner tonight who is<br>Nicola Beaton<br>so to those winners go well serve have<br>fun when you are in Wellington or in<br>Queensland and in particular we are<br>confident that you will be very<br>confident in excellent ambassadors for<br>the University of Otago thank you very<br>much<br>well done well done the winners but I<br>actually all think you're winners to<br>have come this far it's just brilliant<br>it takes a lot to coordinate a 3mt and<br>there are a number of people to thank<br>firstly I would like to thank the teams<br>in both marketing and communications and<br>gr s for all their hard work in<br>organising the heats particular thanks<br>ode to Andrew Lowe knee and Kimberly<br>LeMond thank you very much thank you to<br>to the judges the judges and all the<br>heats there's a lot of people who went<br>through those into all those who<br>participated in the heats as well a big<br>thank you is owed to our sponsor David<br>Smith's a director from hollow world<br>Dunedin we're going to keep our sponsors<br>happy I'd also like to thank you the<br>audience for coming along and supporting<br>your students your friends and your<br>colleagues and I'd like to thank the<br>judges and finals for their insightful<br>adjudication except for you Richard no I<br>would like to thank them and so should<br>finally I would like to think once more<br>and congratulate the finest finalists<br>getting to the final of the Otago 3mt is<br>a huge achievement you all did really<br>really well<br>and you should be proud of yourselves I<br>know that we are so well done you gave<br>fantastic presentations and I reckon you<br>probably deserve a drink about now one<br>more time<br>congratulate them all fantastic<br>before she runs

drink in a chat at the staff club</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
