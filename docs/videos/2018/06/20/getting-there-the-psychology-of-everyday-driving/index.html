you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor<br>Samuel Charlton Sam as an engineering<br>psychologist with over 30 years<br>experience investigating issues in<br>applied cognitive psychology and human<br>factors the founding member of the<br>university of waikato transport research<br>group his work has examined a range of<br>road transport issues such as driver<br>attentiveness and fatigue drivers<br>perceptions of risk and speed and the<br>design of self-explaining roads his NZTA<br>funded research into the effect of<br>cellphones on driver performance led to<br>changes in the land transport road user<br>amendment rule in 2009 and 2011 his<br>research and - acute error effects<br>associated with moderate use of alcohol<br>by drivers informed government policy<br>and led to changes to the land transport<br>rose road user amendment rule in 2014<br>Sam's also interested in driving as<br>skilled behavior and how it can inform<br>theory development and attention<br>decision-making and automaticity of<br>performance Sam is internationally<br>recognized as a leader in the areas of<br>driver simulation and driver behavior<br>research is the editor in chief of the<br>Elsevier journal traffic psychology and<br>behavior his work has been recognized<br>with the research excellence award from<br>the New Zealand Automobile Association<br>Road Safety innovation and achievement<br>award from the New Zealand local<br>authority traffic Institute and a road<br>safety engineering award from the Road<br>Safety trust and a 3m Traffic Safety<br>innovation award for many years he was<br>technical director of human factors and<br>training analysis for the US Air Force<br>operational test and evaluation center<br>his work on human performance issues for<br>the global positioning system<br>the consolidated Space Operations Center<br>and other projects and whom the US Air<br>Force's exemplary civilian Service Medal<br>in 1993 it's ladies and gentlemen it's<br>my pleasure now to ask you to welcome to<br>the podium professor Samuel Charlton to<br>discuss his recent work and findings<br>entitled getting there<br>the psychology of everyday driving<br>professor Samuel Charlton<br>Giada Tata and welcome I I can't tell<br>you how great it is to see so many<br>friendly faces out there thank you for<br>that introduction Vice Chancellor and<br>tonight I am indeed going to tell you<br>about getting their psychology of<br>everyday driving but first I have to<br>tell you about getting here there's some<br>obligatory slides that just describes<br>where I came from before I arrived<br>now I didn't always study driver<br>behavior in fact I studied everyday<br>hamster behavior for my PhD something<br>called instinctive drift or biological<br>constraints on conditioning hamsters<br>misbehave routinely and in this case<br>bright lights and shock actually<br>increase rates of lever pressing which<br>was an interesting sort of phenomenon<br>didn't fit the laws of learning and<br>that's because it triggered a hoarding<br>response and everyday behavior for<br>hamsters but perhaps not one that was in<br>the textbooks it turns out that if you<br>reward hamsters with food for face<br>washing it actually decreases its future<br>probabilities so food for certain kinds<br>of behaviors is a Punisher and I<br>promised my wife I would show this slide<br>and here it is Jean a three dimensional<br>bell-shaped curve that formed a part of<br>my PhD thesis because I had this idea<br>that that certain responses could be<br>conditioned with certain stimuli more or<br>less readily depending on the species<br>and how sort of prepared they were or<br>how sort of learning oriented they were<br>but those are the reagan-thatcher years<br>there wasn't a lot of job prospects for<br>someone studying hamsters so I had to<br>get applied and get applied pretty<br>quickly and my first position was at the<br>Veterans Administration Medical Center<br>researching recovery of stroke once<br>again the laws of learning didn't seem<br>to apply because relearning something<br>that you already knew how to do but now<br>I've lost the ability to do follows<br>quite different rules I did that for<br>about a year or so and then I<br>hired on with a company called BDM which<br>I guess today would be called a<br>think-tank then it was called a Beltway<br>bandit and we did a variety of different<br>kinds of research knowledge<br>representation and expert systems for<br>four police agencies and security<br>agencies worldwide they've returned to<br>profile people automatically to still<br>are some modeling and field testing for<br>medical procedures wartime medical<br>procedures are are just topsy-turvy of<br>peacetime medical procedures you treat<br>the least injured first so if they can<br>return to duty and a lot of task and<br>skill sort of analysis basic analysis<br>worked for satellite control systems and<br>that's who wound up hiring me away after<br>three years the people doing that<br>satellite control and I took a position<br>with the Air Force operational test and<br>evaluation center we were responsible<br>for testing all the new equipment that<br>the Air Force wanted to buy we tested<br>everything but the ones that I<br>specialized in with these big<br>one-of-a-kind kinds of projects like<br>over the horizon back scatter radar or<br>next-generation radar or the<br>consolidated Space Operations Center but<br>what took up most of my time was this<br>thing the Global Positioning System I<br>worked on that for about six years<br>before we launched any satellites then<br>after we launched one after we launched<br>three after we launched five and so<br>forth and so on it's a very ambitious<br>project and it works today in spite of<br>some some really significant crew<br>workload in situational awareness issues<br>but I'm not going to talk about well<br>well I will show you some pictures our<br>job was to turn things that look like<br>that into things that look like that<br>very very fancy but then in 1995 I I<br>left that and I moved to New Zealand<br>with my family and started studying<br>driver behavior and people sometimes<br>still ask me why study driver behavior<br>to me it's it's even more interesting<br>than any of those things I mentioned<br>it's got it all it's got it all in for a<br>cognitive psychologist anyway it's got<br>attention and memory and decision-making<br>and perception and<br>it's all of those things and what's more<br>we all do it I don't have to teach<br>anybody an artificial sort of task when<br>they come into my laboratory everyone<br>knows how to drive ship to my laboratory<br>and I can investigate that skill that<br>they've already learnt and I believe<br>that applied cognitive psychology or<br>applied psychology of any sort really<br>needs to improve people's quality of<br>life we have a responsibility to sort of<br>give something back and and of course if<br>we get transport improved that has huge<br>benefits in terms of quality of life<br>it's number three in the household<br>budget here in New Zealand it's very<br>expensive proposition it's about 40% of<br>all co2 emissions in New Zealand and<br>it's kind of difficult right now to use<br>here lots and lots of complaints more<br>about that later<br>the third reason third reason is of<br>course it's a significant public health<br>issue it is the number one cause of<br>death for New Zealanders under 35 years<br>of age it's very very expensive about<br>eighty eight point six nine million in<br>Hamilton City alone in one year and<br>that's that's a tremendous cost that we<br>can do without but now I want you to<br>cast your minds back I want you to think<br>back to when you first learned to drive<br>it was bloody hard this young woman<br>here's what she said about it she says<br>it really well I think I drove on the<br>road for the first time yesterday with<br>my dad in the passenger seat supervising<br>I'm terrible at it I'm having so much<br>trouble with staying or wearing aware of<br>everything that's going on and cars are<br>so bulky it's so difficult for me to<br>remain conscious of the fact that while<br>steering I not only have to keep myself<br>away from the side of the road but also<br>the whole other half of the car that I'm<br>not on I feel like driving would be<br>easier if I was in the center of the car<br>for some reason as opposed to one side<br>also I have a tendency to oversteer on<br>turns remember that how difficult it was<br>a lot to do oh it wants it for a<br>cognitive psychologist we tend to pat<br>ourselves on the back especially the<br>ones this study driving and say yeah<br>it's really really hard this is what my<br>colleague from Napier University Stephen<br>straddling said I like it a lot driving<br>is a skill based rule-governed Express<br>of activity involving balancing<br>capability and task difficulty to avoid<br>loss of control and ongoing real-time<br>negotiation with co-present transient<br>others to avoid intersecting<br>trajectories while maintaining and<br>enhancing your self-image his point<br>there is there's an awful lot going on<br>with driving it's a big part of our<br>lives but but regardless of how<br>difficult it seemed when you first<br>started or have difficult it seems to<br>cognitive psychologists with practice it<br>becomes so easy you don't have to give<br>it a second thought<br>listen to what Mabel says while I was<br>driving to work today I thought about<br>how I was driving without actually<br>thinking about it I found it really<br>difficult to go back to feeling the<br>clutch checking the mirrors etc in a<br>conscious way I just do it and that's<br>what we're calling everyday driving you<br>don't have to think about the journey<br>it's all about getting there it's not<br>about the journey we simply get in the<br>car and go and some people over the<br>years have pointed out everyday driving<br>of this sort is a classic example of an<br>automatic response or automatic task<br>here's what weekly and Wagner a number<br>of years ago said once the conscious<br>decision is made to drive to work the<br>drive itself can be quite unconscious<br>and automatic and we may remember very<br>little of the experience once we arrive<br>at our destination I'm sure you've all<br>had similar experiences maybe for<br>example you have to post a letter on the<br>way home you put it prominently on the<br>dashboard or on the steering wheel and<br>you start to drive home and the next<br>thing you know you pull up in the<br>driveway and you look at the letter Y<br>it's an automatic it's an automatic<br>response and and a number of years ago<br>we wrote we called it driving without<br>awareness and we wrote the sense of<br>driving without awareness as an<br>experienced familiar to most drivers a<br>sudden realization that you have no<br>recollection of this past several<br>minutes of driving and that you have<br>arrived at this point in the journey<br>with little or no conscious attention to<br>the surrounding traffic as with other<br>areas of skilled performance many<br>aspects of driving become automated with<br>performance and we've developed a model<br>of how that might work because that's an<br>amazing kind of thing that we do<br>complicated sorts of behaviors without<br>without realizing it or without thinking<br>about it or without any recollection of<br>it and we suggested this tandem model<br>was the reason that you've got this<br>operating process that's conscious<br>process that needs only look in<br>occasionally because it's supported by<br>this big grunty monitoring process<br>that's capable of doing error checking<br>and most routine things and as you as<br>you practice as you drive in more and<br>more places in more and more situations<br>you actually build more and more<br>stimulus response sorts of associations<br>or skills or schemata<br>at this monitoring level it's a lot like<br>an iceberg so you've got this explicit<br>attention maybe ten percent of the time<br>that you require when you're overtaking<br>or learning to drive or navigating in an<br>unfamiliar area but ninety percent of<br>the time you're sweet because you've got<br>this big grunty monitoring process under<br>the surface and so we said this is the<br>default mode free everyday driving that<br>most drivers in fact are driving without<br>awareness most of the time nothing sort<br>of prepared us however for the reaction<br>and the scientific community for those<br>kinds of statements people said well<br>this is inconsistent with most widely<br>accepted views of automaticity this is<br>implausible that someone would have an<br>infinite number of stimulus-response<br>associations for driving situations<br>another anonymous reviewers said there's<br>not a shred of evidence that driving is<br>automatic the mental workload during<br>driving is never zero now part of this<br>issue becomes came about because of how<br>automaticity is studied<br>soon after this idea of two forms of<br>attentional processing automatic<br>processing versus explicit or controlled<br>processing was proposed by by Posner and<br>Schneider and Schneider and Shiffrin it<br>be it became studied almost exclusively<br>in the laboratory using a very<br>constrained set of tasks very short<br>duration ballistic kinds of tasks those<br>who study psychology will know when I<br>say visual search priming and Stroup<br>exactly what that is and yet what we<br>think<br>of as everyday activities or automatic<br>activities have not been studied well at<br>all<br>walking bicycle riding assembly line<br>work washing dishes all too mundane to<br>be studied can can you consider these<br>continuous chains of behavior as being<br>automatic or does it violate something<br>well rather than then sort of wave a red<br>rag it's a bowl any longer we sort of<br>changed our language you stopped calling<br>it automatic and we started calling it<br>for a while preconscious continuous<br>control which is a real big mouthful I<br>don't like it and instead we we just<br>started saying everyday driving and now<br>in the literature when someone says<br>everyday driving we know what they're<br>talking about and they know what we're<br>talking about in a really nice example<br>of this is a study by Hyman and<br>colleagues a few years back you can<br>think about about how you process<br>information quite differently when you<br>are engaged in preconscious continuous<br>control in this study they hung money<br>from a tree along a path where students<br>regularly walked while talking on their<br>cell phone or texting none of the<br>students bumped into the money they all<br>ducked to avoid the money but none of<br>them recognized it as money and stopped<br>to pick it because they were processing<br>this information as an obstacle they<br>were processing it as a guidance cue<br>rather than semantically rather than<br>according to its meaning and we've<br>demonstrated that in driving as well<br>number of years ago in the simulator<br>almost twenty years ago now we showed<br>that adding a continuity line to the<br>beginning of the overtaking lanes kept<br>more drivers left when we demonstrated<br>that just a couple years after that it<br>became the standard treatment for all<br>overtaking lanes in New Zealand these<br>signs also we we spent a lot of time<br>working on here in the Waikato and other<br>places in New Zealand and we showed that<br>these curve warnings they're called<br>chevron site boards that are placed at<br>the tangent point of the curve were<br>really really well at slowing drivers<br>down much better than those advance<br>warning signs with<br>little curvy arrow and yet drivers don't<br>remember seeing them they can't tell you<br>what one was there but it all has a an<br>effect on their behavior it slows them<br>down in fact it doesn't really matter<br>what you write on the sign it could be<br>85 it could be 45 it could be 65 what<br>determines how much you slow down is the<br>size of the sign and there's a nice<br>linear relationship between the size of<br>the sign and the amount that you slow<br>down works really really well in fact we<br>just we determined the same relationship<br>whoops we determine the same<br>relationship for these things these<br>urban rural thresholds a number of years<br>ago the LTS a back then came to us and<br>said what should we write on these signs<br>some of these urban rural thresholds are<br>working really well and some aren't<br>working well at all and we said it<br>doesn't really matter what you write on<br>the sign it's the size of the sign that<br>matters and even if they're blank like<br>that you get the same effect you get the<br>same effect we said about doing an<br>everyday driving experiment a number of<br>years ago this took a long time this<br>took almost two and a half years to run<br>where participants came into the lab<br>over and over and over and over again<br>and our driving simulator and they drove<br>this road until they knew it like the<br>back of their hand didn't take very long<br>before they they reported a zoning out<br>driving on autopilot and we said oh<br>we've we've captured it we've got it in<br>a in a jar we've got everyday driving<br>what does it look like<br>well it's fast we drive faster the more<br>experienced we are and there's decreased<br>speed variability we tend to lock in on<br>one speed and try to maintain it but the<br>most surprising thing is change<br>blindness we don't notice we stop paying<br>attention to changes in the world there<br>was this big prominent building it's<br>really a noticeable building and on some<br>sessions we removed it from the<br>simulation no one noticed we added in<br>signs for pedestrian crossings in places<br>where there shouldn't be one nobody<br>noticed on some trials we changed all<br>the signs from English to German nobody<br>noticed<br>what they did notice is when you mucked<br>around with the guidance cue they're<br>very very good at detecting changes in<br>the center line particularly when you<br>take it away the automatic motor program<br>or the monitoring process it has lost an<br>important cue and people notice that<br>right away what people also notice is<br>police even in the driving simulator<br>where I can guarantee you no one has<br>ever gotten a ticket they immediately<br>hit the brakes immediately so we said<br>this is cool let's build one of these<br>let's build an activation trigger<br>because that's what we were calling it<br>so we had people flash their headlights<br>which also honked the horn every time<br>they saw a Volkswagen Beetle every time<br>they saw a Volkswagen Beetle they<br>flashed their headlights and they got<br>very very good at it that get detected<br>along the way away and flashed it their<br>headlights and in fact the participants<br>told us it's quickly generalized to<br>became a part of their everyday driving<br>behavior and they were flashing their<br>headlights at Volkswagen Beetles all<br>over town and to this day I know one<br>woman that was a participant in the<br>experiment I play badminton with her and<br>she tells me that every time she sees a<br>Volkswagen Beetle she reaches for the<br>thing and this is this as many years<br>later so with experience the look and<br>feel of the roads around us give us<br>expectations about what's going to<br>happen what speed to choose and what<br>will happen and we form those<br>expectations very very reliably we did<br>one experiment to see how good people<br>were at that's categorizing the road<br>types around them and they're they are<br>very good unfortunately those road types<br>that they choose don't always match well<br>the road types that the traffic<br>controlling Authority or the road<br>controlling Authority is using and<br>that's where this conflict comes into<br>into play there are certain cues in<br>these look and feel of these roads that<br>that are natural accelerators that keep<br>get people moving wide lanes forward<br>view you can see a long way you go fast<br>to get there smooth<br>road surface all of these things speed<br>people up things that are narrow or<br>regular vertical elements are natural<br>decelerators and we can actually use<br>that when we design our roads but for<br>the most part most of our roads look<br>identical my New Zealand Road is a New<br>Zealand Road as a New Zealand Road<br>these roads all look very similar and<br>yet they all have speed limits and these<br>roads look all very different and yet<br>they all have the same speed limit we<br>don't help our drivers very much in in<br>developing these good expectations about<br>about who's going to be there and what<br>we want them to do but a number of years<br>ago we had a rather large project took a<br>number of years funded about what was<br>then the foundation for research Science<br>and Technology or forced where we wanted<br>to systematically manipulate the look<br>and feel of a road we really wanted to<br>do is is take a set of roads and roads<br>we wanted people to go quickly on<br>collector roads or arterial roads we<br>want to make look and feel one way and<br>roads that are access roads around where<br>people live we wanted to make look quite<br>different so they would slow down we<br>want to use these natural accelerators<br>and natural decelerators and we also<br>wanted to increase the homogeneity<br>speeds and what that means is everyone<br>going the same speed because because<br>homogeneity of speeds is safer we've<br>known that for quite a number of years<br>when everyone's moving the same speed<br>the the speed the safety benefits are<br>huge when people are moving at different<br>speeds it it produces all kinds of<br>undesirable behaviors like dangerous<br>overtaking and and tailgating and<br>whatnot and in fact in our research we<br>routinely find heterogeneity of speeds<br>or non-homogeneity if you will two very<br>very different groups of drivers some<br>who will want to go ten percent or ten<br>kilometers an hour over what they think<br>the speed limit is and others who who<br>are more safety conscious and want to<br>keep under ten percent or ten kilometers<br>an hour under what they think the speed<br>limit is<br>called these fast movers and slow movers<br>and of course you put up them on the<br>same road and there's not these natural<br>accelerators of decelerators present and<br>you get chaos so we asked for volunteers<br>the people that came knocking on our<br>door was actually Auckland then Auckland<br>City Council and they said take Glen<br>Innes and we did and we divided it in<br>half with a control area and a treatment<br>area and as I said the roads around<br>don't look very different this road on<br>the Left Point England Road handles<br>about 7,000 vehicles per day can't tell<br>from that photo and it looks identical<br>with one of those access roads one of<br>those local roads that handle about 400<br>vehicles per day so we want to do is<br>make them look different right and we<br>came up with a design template with<br>those natural accelerators and<br>decelerate elevators those local roads<br>or access roads we gave we gave lots of<br>things to look at we made people look<br>closer to the bonnet of the car and that<br>slowed people down we prohibited them<br>from looking a long ways away we<br>narrowed the lane we roughen the road<br>surface and for the collector roads we<br>remove things out of the forward<br>visibility and we added delineation so<br>that all the road users have a place to<br>be because collector roads collect more<br>than just cars they collect pedestrians<br>and bicycles and all the rest and of<br>course we had to bring the the people<br>that live there along with us so we had<br>lots and lots and lots of open days and<br>no one ever questioned on my on my<br>expense account why I rented a bouncy<br>castle I was waiting for the university<br>administration to question that that<br>outlay but of course they never did it's<br>really disappointing before before the<br>local roads as I said looked at just<br>like the collector roads after they<br>looked quite different the local roads<br>on the top there we've limited the<br>forward visibility we removed the lines<br>from the road and the collector roads<br>we've added delineation and removed<br>things out of the way of the forward<br>visibility and we gave them lots of<br>things to look at on those access roads<br>we got the schools in the area to to<br>I contribute art the nice part about it<br>was though was the effect on drivers<br>behavior here's our pretreatment speeds<br>before we did anything and you can see<br>that the excess roads and the collector<br>roads people are going about the same<br>speed which is okay it's all 50<br>kilometer in our roads of course but<br>some people are going 30 and some people<br>are going 70 that's that heterogeneity<br>of speeds after those treatments went in<br>looky-looky naturally without signs<br>without enforcement people naturally go<br>the right speed about 30 for access<br>roads or local roads and about over 50<br>for our collector roads over the next<br>five years we achieved a 43% reduction<br>in crashes a 50% reduction in crash<br>costs that means the crashes that<br>occurred were much less severe and there<br>was a young woman who was doing her PhD<br>at aut at the time and she was using<br>this as a case study and estimated that<br>the health benefits because more people<br>were out walking and cycling because it<br>felt safer it was probably three times<br>the road safety benefits as I said no<br>speed signs no enforcement just<br>self-explaining roads and over the years<br>we've collected a lot of field trial<br>data and conducted experiments in the<br>laboratory identifying lots of these<br>natural accelerators natural<br>decelerators this one was a case where<br>we took one of the most dangerous<br>intersections in New Zealand and<br>restricted the the clear site access as<br>on the approach and and slow drivers<br>down five years before we did that we<br>had 24 serious crashes there only one<br>serious crashed that intersection in the<br>ten years following that installation<br>this was some delineation treatments<br>that we tried on on State Highway one<br>from from tear-out south to taupo<br>significant safety gain no increase in<br>speed some signs we did a rather<br>systematic assessment of New Zealand<br>hazard warning signs different signs<br>work better than others none of them<br>work as well as McDonald sign<br>as it turns out signs are not the most<br>effective thing we have in our and our<br>toolkit in fact road markings are and we<br>spend a fair bit of time looking at road<br>markings this is a very recent one where<br>we've trying using different kinds of<br>lines as a continuous cue for what what<br>the speed limit is at any given moment<br>it's not all signs and lines though<br>number of years ago this guy some of you<br>all remember him this is Harry Donovan<br>he was then Minister for for Transport<br>Safety I had been sort of bugging him<br>for a while<br>to eliminate or at least prohibit or<br>restrict talking on cell phones by<br>drivers and he said well is talking on a<br>cell phone any different than talking<br>with a passenger and so we put together<br>a bit of research that showed yes Harry<br>it is quite different for for several<br>reasons talking on a cell phone is very<br>different than talking with a passenger<br>and it leads to many many more crashes<br>talking on a cell phone does and it<br>doesn't matter whether it's hands-free<br>or handheld another gentleman at the end<br>said ta this guy dr. Paul Graham he's<br>chief scientist at the NZTA he came and<br>talked with us a couple of years ago and<br>said we want to reduce the breath<br>alcohol limit or the blood alcohol<br>concentration in New Zealand but we need<br>evidence we need evidence that that it's<br>going to be a safety improvement that<br>it's worth doing because it's really<br>gonna piss people off and so we<br>conducted two studies for him one with<br>moderate amounts of alcohol and one with<br>moderate amounts of alcohol in social<br>situations and yes point oh eight is<br>significantly worse than 0.05 I can tell<br>you<br>and what's more impairment the amount of<br>performance decline increases over time<br>even if the amount of alcohol in your<br>bloodstream stays the same and that was<br>a sort of novel and and very important<br>finding had received a lot of attention<br>worldwide we also in the social drinking<br>situation found significant placebo<br>effects people had no idea how much<br>they'd really imbibed and people<br>King the placebo we're driving just as<br>poorly as people drinking the alcohol<br>and more recently this gentleman<br>furgus take doctor Fergus Tate who is<br>the lead safety advisor at the Transport<br>Agency came to us and asked us is it a<br>benefit or is it a distraction to have<br>one of these apps on your phone in your<br>car telling you where you're going or<br>what the speed is right they're getting<br>a lot of questions about that and so we<br>did some research using a intelligent<br>speed app an app tation or excuse me a<br>intelligent speed warning device and<br>showed that if it's designed right and<br>if it's located in the right place there<br>is a net benefit now doing this kind of<br>work is fun I really enjoy it but it has<br>its drawbacks as soon as you start<br>talking about doing driver behavior<br>research people tell you well I know all<br>about it let me tell you about driver<br>behavior the problem is we don't always<br>have clear insights into our own<br>behavior particularly because 90% of it<br>you're unaware of and but people are<br>more than happy to tell you what the<br>real problem is they'll tell you that<br>it's the young drivers driving too fast<br>it's the old drivers driving too slow<br>it's the drink drivers driving stupidly<br>it's the tourist drivers driving badly<br>it's always the other driver that's just<br>the way we view the world another sort<br>of drawback or challenge for us is is<br>that government policymakers aren't<br>always interested in the causes we are<br>doing this research to find out<br>something about the way the mind works<br>well and about how humans behave they're<br>not always interested in that they would<br>really just like to know where to put up<br>the barriers to stop things from from<br>going pear-shaped they want us to focus<br>on the high risk areas and of course we<br>do that a little one of the most recent<br>ones is we raise the driving age because<br>those young drivers right they're<br>over-represented the only 7% of the<br>driving population but they're involved<br>in 14% of the faith<br>Crash's but we argued you might just as<br>well want to reduce the maximum driving<br>age because older drivers are<br>overrepresented as well in the rates of<br>intersection crashes and fatigue related<br>crashes and of course you often hear<br>that we want to get tough on drunk<br>drivers and it's true that 16 percent of<br>drivers treated at the midland regional<br>trauma service here are over the BAC<br>limit but a better option would be to<br>get tough on drunk Walker's because 56<br>percent of pedestrians treated at the<br>midland regional trauma service are over<br>the BAC limit and if you want to really<br>get it just out while driving in<br>Northland in the Waikato because those<br>are the areas that are with the greatest<br>over-representation but drilling down as<br>being a good academic we want to we want<br>to really drill down to the area of<br>highest risk and it's a women from<br>Hungary the highest rates of collision<br>across the two islands do come from<br>fungal a women report an incidence of<br>at-fault collisions two and a half times<br>the national average of course there's<br>some very good drivers if longer eight -<br>and I guess what I want to leave you<br>with or what I want to tell you is that<br>you know it's not the other drivers it's<br>all of us and it's in the driving that<br>we do every day and that's where the<br>answers are<br>to be found the answers about driving<br>safely and the way the mind works I need<br>to acknowledge some people of course I<br>need to acknowledge my family who are<br>here tonight thank you so much for<br>coming I'd like to acknowledge some my<br>collaborators past and present I'll name<br>three in particular Bruce Taylor Peter<br>bass and Nicholas and of course<br>there's a lot of people involved in this<br>kind of work all the support staff our<br>technicians the steering group members<br>and all of these different projects the<br>post grad students I've had and still<br>have and the postdocs and the research<br>assistants and participants and of<br>course the funders you're doing<br>Transport Agency newzealand Automobile<br>Association Research Foundation and of<br>course the University of Waikato all of<br>which I'd like to acknowledge and that's<br>it ladies and gentlemen thanks very much<br>Kirito I'm Alison Kirkman from the<br>Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and<br>as my real pleasure to thank professor<br>Charlton for his presentation tonight<br>within the faculty we pride ourselves on<br>the undertaking of research that<br>contributes to the betterment of all our<br>lives and professor Charlton's applied<br>research exemplifies the same I'm going<br>to point just to repeat to three<br>examples one that you didn't mention<br>tonight professor Charlton's the first<br>one is on driver fatigue and why I'm<br>pointing to these three examples as<br>showing the whole span which you have<br>shown tonight also across your whole<br>career and the impact across your whole<br>career of your research professor<br>Charlton's research on driver fatigue<br>and impaired psychomotor performance and<br>New Zealand truck drivers led to the<br>promotion of fatigue management programs<br>by government in their adoption by large<br>sections of the trucking industry I<br>think of this research as I Drive<br>backwards and forwards across the Como's<br>and I suspect on this drive I'm not<br>driving automatically in the way Sam has<br>demonstrated tonight and I also hope the<br>truck drivers have been part of this<br>program second has researched<br>quantifying the destructive effects of<br>mobile phone conversations and how they<br>differ from conversations with passenger<br>passengers led to changes in the land<br>transport amendment amendment rule and<br>has also been influential and law<br>changes in other jurisdictions finally<br>the research I want to mention as has<br>worked with us colleague in the school<br>of psychology professor Nicholas Starkey<br>on the effects of different levels of<br>alcohol and driving performance which<br>she's talked about tonight<br>all of Sam's research what she's talked<br>about tonight and which we know about<br>from our reading has had an impact and<br>the actual lives of individuals and I<br>think that's a real achievement<br>professor Charlton its traditional in<br>inaugural lectures that no questions are<br>taken from the floor and as we conclude<br>this part of the evening I'm inviting<br>everyone to join us for refreshments in<br>the foyer<br>once there I'm sure professor Charlton<br>will be willing to discuss his research<br>with you<br>but before we move to the foyer can I<br>ask everyone again to acknowledge and<br>thank professor children for his<br>engaging and insightful presentation I'm<br>sure that the points he's made tonight<br>will remain with us as we go about our<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
