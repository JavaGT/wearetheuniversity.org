She has won the inaugural Sir Peter Blake Trust environment award for her work in marine research and conservation. Associate Professor Constantine's work on a campaign to increase protections for whale populations within the Hauraki Gulf led to slower speeds for large vessels which has dramatically reduced the number of whales injured or killed by ship strike. She has been instrumental in leading a number of initiatives for expanded protection for humpback whales and Māui’s dolphin including revision of guidelines for international dolphin-watch tourism. She was also a strong advocate for the creation of a marine reserve at the Kermadec Islands.<br><br>Video produced by the Sir Peter Blake Trust</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Rochelle Constantine is an accomplished<br>biologist and inspirational lecturer and<br>a relentless champion for the marine<br>environment her academic record as one<br>of New Zealand's most distinguished<br>marine ecologists spans decades of<br>groundbreaking research into the habits<br>of marine mammals her research has led<br>to expanded protection for humpback<br>whales and Maui Dolphins and revision of<br>international dolphin watch tourism<br>practices I often describe myself as a<br>conductor of orchestras so I I'm really<br>I get really excited about certain<br>questions or the things challenges and<br>the first thing I think of is who can I<br>get to come on board and helping an<br>service her accomplishments as a<br>conservation campaigner are just as<br>significant she lived the successful<br>campaign to slow traffic in the hotaki<br>Gulf all but eliminating whales straight<br>by seagoing vessels in the region you<br>know going to people in my enthusiasm I<br>think helps bring others on board and<br>then often I like find any risk-taking<br>people as well because if you take risks<br>usually you're you'll gain a lot more at<br>there in her work as a researcher and<br>passionate marine science lecturer is an<br>inspiration to students in the<br>University of Auckland's School of<br>Biological Sciences and Institute of<br>Marine Science where she shares her wide<br>knowledge and resolve I think my legacy<br>isn't necessarily mine it's mine of the<br>collective and and so I guess and lots<br>of ways the success will come from<br>enabling others working with others that<br>in the future our planet our ocean will<br>be a better place because the ocean<br>needs some help you know so Peter Blake<br>knew that and that was you know his<br>final years were dedicated to that and I<br>think the answers lie and everyone</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
