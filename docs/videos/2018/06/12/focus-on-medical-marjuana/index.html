Last year Victoria crowdfunded to create the educational documentary, ‘Mum, Cannabis and Me: the right to informed choice’, with the aim of highlighting the science, ethics and law surrounding cannabis as a medicine to increase patient health outcomes and minimise harm. Victoria discusses her film (not part of this recording but the trailer is available here <br>https://vimeo.com/ondemand/mumcannabisandme)<br><br>Following Victoria, Associate Professor John Ashton from the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology provides an overview of the ways in which THC acts on cannabinoid receptors, and CBD, which acts on a variety of other molecular targets. <br><br>THC based products have been under investigation for analgesia, and CBD mainly as a drug for childhood epilepsy. Although THC has undoubted analgesic effects, experiments have found that these are moderate at best, and in some clinical trials do little better than placebo. The best quality data has come from clinical trials run by GW Pharma, whose products include Epidiolex (CBD) and Sativex (a 1:1 mix of THC and CBD). Although trials for Dravet’s syndrome using Epidiolex were initially promising, analysis of pharmacokinetic interactions of the drug with other drugs used by patients have cast doubt on these results. With respect to cancer pain, Sativex failed to relieve pain to an extent greater than placebo. <br><br>This evidence base is at odds with anecdotes from some patients. It has been suggested that cannabis is used not so much by these patients for direct analgesia, but for its non-specific sedating and mood altering properties.

please<br>identify themselves okay just a reminder<br>if anyone else is that Tory is happy to<br>be recorded and filmed but not our<br>second speaker associate professor John<br>Ashton okay so my name is Lindley<br>Anderson I'm the head of department of<br>the bioethics Center and I'll be<br>emceeing this event we all know that<br>cannabis and medicinal cabinet cannabis<br>has been in the news recently we know<br>that many places around the world have<br>relaxed their laws around the use of<br>cannabis and its derivatives for either<br>medicinal use but also for recreational<br>use new zealand least so but we do have<br>a bill currently before the house and<br>this bill would amend the misuse of<br>Drugs Act 1975 in three separate ways to<br>introduce an exception and a statutory<br>defense for terminally ill people to<br>possess and use illicit cannabis and<br>cannabis utensils and provide a<br>regulation making power to enable the<br>setting of standards that products<br>manufactured imported and supplied under<br>licence must meet and amend schedule 2<br>of the Act<br>so that cannabidiol CBD and CBD products<br>are no longer classed as controlled<br>drugs the measures are intended to<br>improve access to medicinal cannabis and<br>are guided by principles of fairness<br>quality and safety and compassion so<br>that's where we're at at the moment in<br>New Zealand today we're going to hear<br>from two people we're going to hear from<br>Victoria Keith Wood is sitting<br>am i right now Tory is a trainee intern<br>who's been looking at the use of<br>cannabis as a medicine she's got a<br>rather personal story and we're going to<br>watch a documentary about the story of<br>her mother and the documentary is called<br>mum cannabis in me and Tori's mother was<br>in the position of needing to use<br>cannabis and it's in different forms so<br>we'll watch the documentary and then<br>we'll hear from associate professor John<br>Ashton and genres from the department of<br>pharmacology and toxicology at the<br>University of Otago and he's going to<br>tell us some of the science around<br>cannabis and its uses so I'm gonna hand<br>directly over to Victoria thank you so<br>much for coming and thank you for making<br>the documentary I'm sure you'll all<br>enjoy it thanks everybody hear me yeah<br>okay great so I just like to introduce<br>myself again i'm victoria Catherwood I'm<br>a training intern at the Christchurch<br>School of Medicine University of Otago<br>branch<br>I am currently taking some time off my<br>year which for reasons I'll explain<br>later I'm going to play this documentary<br>first and then I'm going to give a<br>10-minute presentation and we'll field<br>thanks that can everybody hear me okay<br>can I just quickly see a quick raise of<br>hands of people who have already seen<br>that documentary<br>just a couple okay great thanks for that<br>so hopefully that was somewhat<br>thought-provoking for you I'm now going<br>to just give a bit of any explanation as<br>to what's happened since the documentary<br>and you know pass on to John and he'll<br>explain the science behind it so like I<br>said before I'm currently based in<br>Christchurch in terms of what I'm going<br>to talk about<br>I'm going to talk about what happened<br>since the documentary I went to<br>California to study under some doctors<br>over there who do recommend and<br>prescribe cannabis as a medicine so I'll<br>talk about what I found out from them as<br>well and I also talked about my own<br>house journey and I should only talk for<br>about ten minutes so just to kind of<br>summarize from the documentary it was<br>released in September last year and mom<br>is still alive and she was still<br>currently defying medicine daily and she<br>is still using cannabis as a medicine<br>unfortunately she's not using the legal<br>substance anymore side effects because<br>it was pretty difficult to get and was<br>really expensive she also has I guess a<br>lot of issues around the fact that a you<br>know cannabis as a medicine the whole<br>plant is still illegal with hopefully<br>this new law change things will become<br>beautiful her least stress because it's<br>not well she has a protection around<br>being convicted but she could still be<br>prosecuted under the new law in<br>proposing so is he still issues around<br>getting prosecuted which hindering her<br>house in terms of the documentary itself<br>because it was a crowdfunded we decided<br>to do crowd screening so we showed the<br>documentary throughout New Zealand and<br>the month of September at 12 different<br>locations we've heard some pretty<br>extraordinary response both nationally<br>and internationally as well it was shown<br>also at the Australasian integrative<br>medicine Association conference a couple<br>of weeks ago and it was really well<br>received by the doctors and health<br>practitioners that were there to-- so I<br>plan to go to California during my<br>elective and I just recently came back<br>and learnt some pretty incredible I<br>guess the way that they use medicine<br>cannabis isn't me there's no video it<br>was it was pretty incredible to learn<br>what they're doing right and what<br>they're doing wrong so they definitely<br>don't have things 100% right so it is<br>still federally illegal which means that<br>dispensaries are<br>shut down California and the first<br>January made cannabis recreationally<br>legal but it's still federally illegal<br>so there's this in terms of medicinal<br>recreational use it's still difficult<br>there is in terms of medical axes and<br>medicinal access I learned in California<br>that they are actually quite different<br>so the medical side over there is sort<br>of single I select compounds they have a<br>compound which is synthetic THC called<br>mono which is the trademark name or<br>Geneva no they can prescribe that but it<br>does have a lot more side effects and<br>it's more expensive as well but it does<br>allow doctors to kind of get a dose<br>which then often they will be in<br>recommend get a recommendation for<br>cannabis as a medicine and that patient<br>can then go to the dispensary and say<br>look this dose of THC works well for me<br>can you please give me some advice on on<br>whole cannabis as medicine so patients<br>can switch between being prescribed the<br>the medical single single isolate form<br>or they can get a recommendation for<br>medicinal cannabis that they go to a<br>dispensary and then they have a whole<br>range of products that they can access<br>that way in terms of the chemicals I<br>know that John will talk about this<br>shortly but I did learn there there is a<br>phenomena within the the scientific<br>world called the entourage effect and<br>I'm sure that John will probably touch<br>on this but it serves the idea that<br>since the scientists and biochemists<br>discovered THC and CBD back in the<br>sixties they have realized that they<br>don't get the same findings from single<br>isolate studies is what they do on the<br>whole plant and in terms of efficacy so<br>sometimes the yeah the entourage effect<br>means that that doctors tend to prefer<br>to recommend whole plant cannabis rather<br>than single Ursula medical cannabis<br>because it has fewer side effects and I<br>did learn that from the four doctors<br>that I studied under that's obviously<br>what<br>they are saying that again and again as<br>well different cannabis trains are<br>available over there's obviously a huge<br>range where they vary the concentrations<br>of THC and CBD and they obviously have<br>have different effects these different<br>ratios of different cannabinoids I don't<br>think that there's a whole huge body of<br>literature in terms of what rate ratios<br>Australians are good for different<br>conditions but it seems within the<br>community anecdotally people seem to<br>have ideas as to what they would they<br>prefer and what other patients prefer so<br>it's kind of a different strokes for<br>different folks kind of mentality<br>patients go into these dispensaries and<br>they try something very low low dose<br>they start low and they go slow and they<br>kind of move up into different strains<br>and different methods of using it in<br>terms of the methods of actually getting<br>cannabis only to other patients and<br>there's obviously the inducing so either<br>eating it or juicing it<br>there's also having sublingually you can<br>get through drops or other mechanisms is<br>a side effects as a sublingual alcohol<br>tincture of cannabis which is<br>sublingually gets into the body topic<br>clearly there's bombs as well directly<br>there are suppositories being used over<br>in the state and obviously also inhale<br>inhaling however a lot of the doctors<br>didn't ever recommend smoking it so just<br>so you know and they did recommending<br>recommend the harm minimizing model<br>which were in vaping if they wanted a<br>fast release form of cannabis to help<br>them with something that for example<br>pain but they didn't actually recommend<br>it and so just you know just keeping it<br>open in terms of the consultation and<br>how doctors go about you know having<br>consult with patients of surrounding<br>cannabis as a medicine it was always a<br>pre visit screen so the notes from the<br>patient will always transfer to the<br>doctors prior to the doctors having a<br>consult with the patient they would<br>always ask what was the diagnosis and<br>who was it diagnosed from and what okay<br>and they're doing available for<br>investigations in terms of treatment<br>they always want to know what treatment<br>they've had and what treatment they<br>currently on the appointment<br>from sort of 30 minutes to 60 minutes<br>depending on the complexity of the case<br>these doctors that I am studied under<br>were doing things I guess in the right<br>way there are also Skype booths and some<br>dispensaries where doctors can give a<br>recommendation over five minutes and<br>these doctors strongly criticize that<br>that model and they said that this is<br>not it's not a way of treating it like a<br>normal medicine so this is the 30<br>minutes to 60 minute concert as sort of<br>the the guideline over there so the<br>doctors would discuss the history the<br>science the effects and the kind of<br>legal aspects around it the beginning<br>state their room and I guess it would<br>give the patients a chance to asking<br>questions if they had any often the<br>patients were quite curious around<br>driving and cannabis and working in<br>cannabis so that's quite interesting<br>because THC or the gentleman all the<br>synthetic THC is legal to drive on and<br>it's legal to test positive for it work<br>however medicinal cannabis that is<br>illegal to drive on and that's illegal<br>to test positive for a few workplace<br>doesn't allow it so there's still a huge<br>discrepancy in the medical versus<br>medicinal world and hopefully it gets<br>better but um you know there were a lot<br>of questions around that which was<br>interesting the doctors were being give<br>the patient and really thorough<br>examinations to take vitals and sort of<br>a review of the systems which of they<br>were and then the treatment would sort<br>of be either the prescribed single<br>isomer or a recommendation for the whole<br>plant from from a dispensary but<br>basically it's just like any other form<br>of medicine practice good medicine and<br>take really good medical notes that was<br>the general gist so in terms of my<br>health journey I mentioned before there<br>I've taken time off school so this is my<br>this is my tumor yeah this isn't my left<br>prefrontal cortex and this is the reason<br>that I have decided to take Thomas go I<br>think it's been my last been a bit of an<br>adventure since all of us cannabis death<br>began but it wasn't incidental finding I<br>had them to have some symptoms watching<br>and a brain scan and we found this so<br>I've taken time out from this year and<br>I'm going to return next year and finish<br>my studies I have a repeat skin in a<br>couple of months but I'm heading to<br>Europe and a couple of days there's a<br>conference over there and there's a<br>couple of scientists who do some really<br>incredible research so I give now the<br>story's kind of turned back around on me<br>and I'm looking for my own informed<br>choice so I guess I've got a background<br>in biochemistry I did my masters and<br>finished in 2013 and with my math I did<br>a bit of research the the statistics<br>don't really apply to me because it was<br>a completeness of into a finding however<br>those statistics The Critic does more if<br>you look them up on google it says that<br>i had seven years till of which given<br>the current research that I did do seven<br>years is not a long time and there is a<br>scientist in Spain called Christine<br>Sanchez and she does some pretty<br>incredible stuff with THC and ester a<br>sarcoma cells and petri dishes<br>astrocytoma as the most common brain<br>glioma and so I'm going to go meet up<br>with her and talk about sort of possible<br>ways for it and just get an idea I'm not<br>rolling out surgery at all I think it's<br>just really important given what I can<br>find to make my own informed choice in<br>2017 GW Pharmaceuticals who make the<br>cannabis tank sure side-effects they did<br>a phase two placebo controlled study and<br>21 patients with recurrent glioblastoma<br>multiforme a which is the late stage of<br>what I have or what they think I have<br>and they found that teens rose and<br>sativex a day and for the duration of<br>their work in conjunction with two Mazal<br>to Mozilla Meyer which is a chemotherapy<br>drug standard for glioblastoma<br>multiforme a and they found that in<br>patients who were exposed to this sort<br>of low-dose cannabis lived on average<br>50% longer and then the patients who<br>weren't exposed so I think it's pretty<br>compelling there's also other<br>research and humans that do suggest this<br>finding as well but I mean I don't I<br>don't know exactly when you read a study<br>what goes on behind the scene so my idea<br>of going over Europe is just to kind of<br>you know a bit of idea to make an<br>informed choice so watch this space<br>cause we're like and say and we have<br>questions later<br>yeah come Thanks thank you very much<br>Tory thank you for your personal story<br>about your mother<br>and your journey but also also your own<br>personal stories so thank you very much<br>and I'm sure the entire group here wish<br>you well on your travels to Europe and<br>in the success of any future treatment<br>come so the next speaker thank you very<br>much the next speaker is associate<br>professor John Ashton as I said before<br>from the department of pharmacology and<br>toxicology so I will hand over<br>I wasn't going to start the my talk this<br>way but after that well I have a<br>confession disclosure to make I am also<br>I've got Stage four lung cancer same as<br>Tory's mum I died however I was<br>diagnosed nearly five years ago and<br>spent seven months very close to death<br>and then went on a targeted therapy<br>which it's given me a really good<br>remission but one of these days it'll<br>stop working so I'm telling you this<br>because well I've got skin in the game<br>I've got this is interest in finding the<br>best possible this possible treatment<br>for myself and being in this role I've<br>done a lot of patient advocacy work in<br>that time so I meet a lot of patients a<br>lot of oncologists and I'm on clothes<br>Facebook sites talking to hundreds of<br>different people with advanced cancer<br>and yeah I hear a lot of a lot of a lot<br>of things a lot of stories and I can't<br>really relay and so having that<br>interaction to gives me a vested<br>interest in trying to find the best<br>quality information I can write so why<br>I've called my talk between evidence and<br>Eric voters because when I talk to<br>oncologists a lot of them will say my<br>patients some very intelligent very<br>well-educated patients and they say<br>cannabis makes them feel better and make<br>that it works for them it's good and<br>then I go to the evidence-based medicine<br>approach the clinical trials and it's a<br>little bit underwhelming and so trying<br>to work out exactly what's what's going<br>on there<br>so I think the first thing we need to do<br>is realize that we're talking about<br>essentially - well actually various but<br>at least two different drugs here they<br>both come from cannabis but they're very<br>different I mean it's not like just<br>talking about codeine and morphine which<br>you can both get from opium which at<br>least work on the same target these<br>don't work on the same receptor target<br>so THC it's the one that gives the high<br>it some works on cannabinoid receptors<br>which Michelle talked about the<br>g-protein coupled receptors cannabidiol<br>or CBD which has also been in the news<br>well it doesn't really activate<br>cannabinoid receptors it works on them<br>in some sort of roundabout sort of ways<br>but not not twenty great except I would<br>say it's not psychoactive there is some<br>evidence that it's it has sedating<br>properties Ang's the electric properties<br>but it doesn't cause euphoria so in a<br>lot of media stories is medicinal middie<br>of course I don't know ministers<br>cannabis and these two things wrapped<br>and together and you know we know I hear<br>cannabis I think someone's smoking a<br>joint but after they're talking about a<br>Medora of oil it's very different things<br>all together right so that distinction<br>has to be made<br>and it's very important because<br>essentially we talk about two different<br>drugs given the same name so I'm going<br>to focus on two different types of<br>treatment I'm going to look at THC on a<br>talk about analgesia what is the<br>evidence for THC having pain reducing<br>effects well in rodent experiments<br>there's what we call the tetrad test for<br>cannabinoid activity one of those four<br>properties is analgesia so as a<br>recognized feature of THC my question is<br>how good is that therapeutic Lea<br>compared to placebo how beneficial is<br>that so the evidence base is this is<br>quite as Tory said it's quite tricky<br>you've got the smoked cannabis which is<br>quite rare there not many trials because<br>of the gala tea there there are some and<br>then there are most of the trials views<br>which have been larger-scale randomized<br>placebo-controlled etc is using Sativex<br>which is a one-to-one mix of THC and CBD<br>so it's both drugs together or there's<br>another drug by GW Pharma called<br>epidemics which is a purified form of<br>CBT so I'm gonna come back to CBD so I'm<br>sort of back up and say why my genes<br>like me so sort of skeptical about<br>anecdotes or not skip talk about the<br>stories themselves I people I believe<br>what people say what but why isn't it<br>that it's you it's counted as as as<br>strong evidence as clinical trials well<br>I think there are at least three things<br>and the first one isn't really well<br>understood alright so if you ask me why<br>do we need randomized placebo control<br>trial so it's like you see perfect but<br>that's that's one of the things probably<br>the main thing as this thing called<br>regression to the mean<br>sometimes are very over very over time<br>so I had so I had thoracic pain I think<br>that's the same way your mom described<br>she's a stabbing pain and in the other<br>side before I got adequate treatment um<br>but there wasn't all the time sometimes<br>some days was good sometimes it was bad<br>and at varied right so on the days when<br>it was bad I would be more motivated to<br>try to do something about it right but<br>this regression to the mean means that<br>you have a particularly bad day then the<br>next day is more likely to be close to<br>an average day<br>right it's a regression to the mean so<br>you walk along the street see a 7-foot<br>tall person you think it's the person I<br>see next likely to be seven foot tall or<br>closer to the average if it'll be closer<br>to the average same with you see someone<br>about four foot right so this can give<br>the illusion of successful treatment so<br>a regression to the mean is what is one<br>of the fundamental things that clinical<br>trials using for controls match controls<br>trying to get around there's also the<br>problem of anecdotal reporting so<br>positive anecdotes of newsworthy we get<br>spread around you're gonna I've got lots<br>of negative anecdotes I can't tell was<br>there give it to me in confidence but<br>they don't really get communicated so<br>again in a kanay in a trial you've got<br>all the positive and all the negative<br>evidence together and then there are as<br>courses it'll see perfect but see both<br>effects in pain studies and in mu and<br>studies can be very very strong one of<br>the side effects trials had a 20% pain<br>reduction from placebo but only 10% they<br>said of its result right anyway so<br>eventually the trials themselves so most<br>of the trials with pain and sativex up<br>until very recently have been for<br>patients with multiple sclerosis and so<br>it is indicated for use it is allowed<br>for use and new zealand's for those<br>patients it most of their muscle<br>most of the pain relief seems to come<br>from reducing that painful muscle spasms<br>but there is an effect on neuropathic<br>pain that is pain due to pathologies and<br>the nerves themselves GW Pharma have<br>more recently done some very large-scale<br>trials with said of its cancer pain and<br>been quite disappointing it's a lot of<br>hope for those anyway so I'm gonna go<br>back a few years and I reviewed the<br>evidence back in 2012 for can happen<br>always a neuropathic pain and I just<br>I'll just select out some points from it<br>this is from a meta-analysis are done<br>aback in 2007 and it looked at Sativex<br>looked at Drummond at remember Knoll<br>which is a basically synthetic THC and<br>cannabidiol right so Sativex is<br>essentially both together then you got<br>receive oh there so that was it's about<br>as good as the evidence gets as this<br>type of meta-analysis they even that's<br>difficult because it's there's a lot of<br>heterogeneity and the pain outcomes<br>we've got muscle spasm we've got<br>virtually you've got um we've got your<br>pettit pain of other types as well but<br>anyway you can see is that overall there<br>was about a this is a VA s visual<br>assessment scale for pain and about a<br>better one about a 10% drop on pain from<br>Seba effect about double from side<br>effects and a banal cannabinol i<br>cannabidiol that so there is a real<br>effect here not mess about given the<br>subtraction from the placebo here<br>getting better with time in these trials<br>now that's difficult to actually<br>interpret because at this stage it's<br>usually an open-label trial there's no<br>actual imaginable super so it's<br>difficult to actually assess what that<br>means<br>alright so that is not inconsiderable hi<br>Roy<br>just more recently GW Pharma announced<br>results of their cancer pain trials and<br>in this one the side-effects failed to<br>show you superiority over the sasebo at<br>all which is but we're disappointing<br>would you compare the some of the<br>evidence base for some of the more<br>standard pain relievers you've got<br>paracetamol does better than that<br>so does ibuprofen and you've got to<br>morphine about 75% of patients get at<br>least 50% pain reduction so the next set<br>of trials at GW Pharma did was focusing<br>on patients who were refractory to<br>opioid therapy who didn't get any any<br>relief and unfortunately that failed to<br>any give any sort of demonstrable effect<br>on a numerical rating scale for pain<br>over and above cancellation now one<br>thing I haven't got in this talk but I<br>just reminded of listening to Tory talk<br>is that there has been a smaller trial<br>done with combination opioids Sativex<br>and there was about around about a third<br>reduction in opioid use so it's kind of<br>consistent with what some experienced<br>but by itself doesn't seem to do a lot<br>in these trials at least remember these<br>are very hard cases these are people who<br>you don't know getting relief from<br>anything so there's sativex there's a<br>problem with set of X and that is as we<br>heard Michelle say dose is everything<br>but dose effective dose or concentration<br>of site of action depends upon route of<br>administration how quickly the drugs<br>getting to the body so let us look at<br>some some ways in which sativex differs<br>from smoked cannabis<br>so here's studying on smoked cannabis<br>and what this is showing is is the<br>inhalation and we're getting about up to<br>150 micrograms Polly<br>to concentration the plasma of THC<br>notice it drops away very quickly that's<br>not because it's leaving the body it's<br>because it's very little philic at the<br>plasma very quickly some of it is<br>metabolized to her dropsy form of THC<br>and then to carboxy form and which is<br>glucuronidation it eliminated this is<br>quite interesting because well there's a<br>couple of things wanted to share amount<br>of THC the other is the presence of this<br>one hydroxy THC which is there's some<br>theories at some of the less desirable<br>aspects of taking cannabis are due to<br>this it's an active metabolite it's<br>formed by p450 enzymes in the liver so<br>in the smoke form you don't get a lot of<br>it being produced all right but if we<br>look at that compared to side of X so if<br>this has got a whole lot going on but we<br>just look at the ones with the circles<br>which is if you can see look at just THC<br>to start with first of all note that the<br>sheer amount of THC is I've been putting<br>things out for a ok couldn't see ok so<br>that the sheer amount of THC is about 15<br>times lower which is a lot the other<br>thing is you can see there is quite a<br>lot more hydroxy THC produced why is<br>that it's because it's an our own<br>mucosal spray and a lot of it gets<br>swallowed gets metabolized but first<br>pass metabolism you get this produced so<br>so which at least the question well what<br>about is it just simply because Santa<br>vyx is not getting enough THC into<br>people's by the way that that inter eyes<br>effect could be partly to do to this CBD<br>and THC both can<br>Peter the same metabolic enzymes so<br>there might be some effect on the<br>production of hydroxyl for yes all right<br>so again going back to when I reviewed<br>all this there was a few only very few<br>papers I could find a few years ago<br>which had used smoked cannabis for pain<br>one of them was in a clinic with HIV<br>where people were getting a neuropathic<br>pain from HIV and what the results of<br>the study was for about one in every<br>three or four patients treated one would<br>get about 30% pain reduction the other<br>one what I found was a more experimental<br>sort of situation we kept saying was<br>uses that chili pepper compound to<br>produce pain and that was a little bit<br>more difficult to interpret because at<br>low concentrations low amounts of THC<br>gave pain relief high concentrations<br>that made it worse but there's been a<br>few studies done since then here's one<br>which was used on again the smoked<br>cannabis in neuropathic pain and you can<br>see here it's a pretty profound SIBO<br>effect but th see both the lower and<br>high doses to outperform it by about<br>seven or eight points on the VAF scale<br>which is enough to come some people<br>considerable relief to interpret these<br>graphs do realize that when we talk<br>about a 10-point difference<br>you've got to you've got to really<br>convert that into heads to a percentage<br>from the baseline score so hundred would<br>be unbearable pain so we're talking<br>about fifty maybe ten ten points out of<br>fifty so that's a twenty percent pain<br>reduction overall you can see it's more<br>than that but we're really talking about<br>the difference from the placebo effect<br>here's a recent review which was came<br>a few more THC smoked cannabis trials<br>and the it was largely negative on a<br>vote pain which evokes means basically<br>breaking some of the pen and but there<br>was a lot of reports and improvement of<br>quality of life so we come back to that<br>thing I started with about patients<br>saying it makes them feel better which<br>is improving the quality life for pretty<br>much the same thing they're trying to<br>pin down what that means is it's proving<br>to be tricky lastly there has been<br>trials with inhaled THC scissors again<br>more of a titrated quality controlled<br>knowing dose for the delivery<br>but getting higher concentrations of THC<br>then you can get from sativex and you<br>can see here that this is pretty messy<br>but there is a strong see birth fact and<br>then a dose-dependent THC effect so this<br>isn't a diabetic neuropathy right<br>there's a whole lot of measurements in<br>this trial but this is one of them two<br>things to note from that really one is<br>the fact there is a difference from<br>placebo it is real but notice how mess<br>of the placebo effect is even by itself<br>so if someone needs to do something<br>about this okay so can't see over here I<br>doesn't mean that they're just notice<br>that yeah but the difference between the<br>how far the placebo comes down from<br>baseline so if you would have been a<br>patient or a doctor and you didn't know<br>you're part of a trial and you've got<br>the placebo you would have been pretty<br>impressed with the pain relief okay so<br>something up th see there is analgesic<br>effects I haven't even talked about the<br>antiemetic effects are well known the<br>fix on appetite and so forth I just<br>because they've got a lot of time I want<br>to quickly get to C V D so C BD hasn't<br>been under some investigation with pain<br>but mostly most of the news has been<br>around its potential as an antiepileptic<br>before particularly hard to treat cases<br>so some of you may have followed the<br>Alex Winton case in Christchurch a few<br>years ago worthy of me as a boy young<br>man was in a induced coma because he had<br>status epilepticus and his mother was on<br>the on the news a lot and she got<br>permission to use our CBD that was<br>Alexson all so licks and all is a hemp<br>oil product which is quite low low<br>concentration of CBD I can't remember<br>off the top of my head exactly what it<br>is it's only about 20% tissue all right<br>compare that with a HIPAA dialects which<br>GW farm have produced which is up there<br>in the high in 98 99 percent purity so<br>this is the one that's really been<br>studied licks and oils been in the news<br>epidural X has been in clinical trial so<br>there was a lot of excitement for GW<br>Pharma cause if shares have been falling<br>when this and they're rising again when<br>this came out last year which is in<br>travail syndrome which is a childhood<br>epilepsy syndrome which is particularly<br>nasty and it<br>these children were resistant to drug<br>treatment and they there was a<br>substantial procedure reduction found<br>for cannabidiol over and above receiver<br>however rates of adverse events actually<br>increased so that's free that was very<br>exciting and in my lab were at the time<br>trying to work out exactly how CBD was<br>doing this unfortunately there's one fly<br>in the ointment with this and that is<br>that CBD inhibits various set p450<br>enzymes<br>which are the main method drug<br>metabolizing enzymes in that trial the<br>children were all kept on their existing<br>antiepileptic medications for ethical<br>reasons now it is not one of those is<br>labelled over them and that is known to<br>be interact with CBD to increase the<br>concentration by two to eight times<br>right so there's been a lot of debate<br>over whether it was a real effect from<br>CBD or whether it's simply if it<br>increases the effective dose of the<br>concomitant medications who knows right<br>I just want to maybe Li for something a<br>little bit more sort of that contentious<br>I suppose and that is just I just love<br>this quote because it was from Charles<br>Newton Hauser works in Christchurch and<br>he is very much the skeptic and he but<br>there was one quote I kind of liked<br>because it sort of sums up what my<br>even you know why is it that some people<br>really give benefit I think part of it<br>is that there is a there is individual<br>differences right so people were<br>different in their metabolizing enzyme<br>so different their response<br>that's what's called our trials are<br>found to respond or analysis and seems<br>to be a subset of people particularly or<br>small to cannabis at this time it's the<br>same with most much drugs but a lot of<br>them when I talk to people it this quote<br>was stood out and makes them feel better<br>and drilling deeper or no talks have got<br>a number of people many names that can<br>range from having a good night's sleep<br>feeling more relaxed<br>not using so much opioids so they're not<br>hung up constipated all the time alright<br>that sounds like a you know stupid<br>little thing but I'm telling you<br>actually being a cancer patient that's<br>not and anyway so jaws is basically said<br>that what's going on here is people are<br>taking for a sort of as a nonspecific<br>NZ little sedating drug and that's<br>something we like to see but anyway I'm<br>gonna leave it there thank you very much<br>John no leave it on yeah leave it on<br>take a seat thank you very much for your<br>own personal story and sharing that with<br>us as well I'm sure people have got lots<br>of questions we probably have about ten<br>minutes or so for questions so has<br>Jeanine oh we've got a little microphone<br>that cube thing that Janine's holding is<br>a microphone actually so go ahead my<br>first question is for John and that is<br>about the increased rate of adverse<br>effects in the title of the CBD trial<br>was that adverse effects serious adverse<br>effects like all cause mortality or<br>where that was that just the minor side<br>and basically the adverse events<br>associated with that's one more will I<br>have this it's fast do you think that<br>there's like a single nucleotide<br>polymorphism that some people have and<br>that we will find that would a tree<br>would have these antics would ground for<br>the anecdotal effects of a certain<br>subset having a huge respect doto<br>response<br>and not being able to be reproduced when<br>you go across the whole population yeah<br>this people being I know John with<br>parlons been trying to track this down<br>trying to we're trying to match up<br>responders to particular polymorphisms<br>and we know there are and they septic<br>genes<br>and not only those but also in the<br>endocannabinoid metabolizing and to<br>catabolism genes i think anyone's that<br>being able to find any any converting<br>explanation here though there are some<br>some of that works really sort of got<br>into trying to see how people were<br>different they also have Isis it<br>pathologies yeah it could be the case I<br>mean apparently it could be I think it<br>could also be farmer cooking it it could<br>be people with metabolizing enzymes<br>different concentrations okay we've got<br>a question in the middle of it hi I'm<br>using this topic but it seems to me that<br>there's quite a lot of scope for humans<br>and if this gets passed in the<br>legislation so do you know if the<br>legislation makes room for or funding<br>for further studies on this question<br>about efficacy of it in humans not as<br>cannabis trials or looking to start them<br>up there's a lot of interest and a lot<br>of the production of more legal<br>production of hemp and cannabis people<br>crying out to to test it in different<br>ways I think yeah I think it's it's<br>close so will that happen whether or not<br>this gets passed or not yep<br>yeah yeah well the research I think is<br>as being lined up to heaven<br>and it was happening blind up to heaven<br>and before the law change the bill was<br>the promised by labor so I don't think<br>that though has anything to do with the<br>research still as difficult as eager<br>with that funding okay<br>can you pass the speaker behind you just<br>one behind and then along this woman<br>here thank you thank you what fascinates<br>me is that we have these count<br>cannabinoid and receptors so they must<br>be part of some sort of evolutionary<br>process why do we hit them okay so the<br>thing is what makes it hard to develop<br>drugs before in a cannabinoid system is<br>it because of the the cannabinoid<br>receptors are virtually everywhere in<br>the brain right so when you have opioid<br>receptors its densities though along the<br>mood and and pain-relieving pathways but<br>with collab annoyed receptors they're<br>involved in virtually everything so it's<br>more like it's more like like glutamate<br>or GABA receptors they're involved in<br>lots and lots of functions and I think<br>the best theory that I've come across is<br>that it's you've the endocannabinoids<br>endogenous cannabinoids now they by and<br>large retrograde transmission from<br>receiving you know that what's you've<br>got a neuron it loses neurotransmitters<br>to another neuron<br>well endocannabinoids go back the other<br>way where they work on cannabinoid<br>receptors and tend to tune down release<br>of whatever is being so it's kind of<br>like a homeostatic or regulatory<br>mechanism at all a huge variety of<br>neurons in the brain so it's got a very<br>basic function in neurophysiology<br>whether they're aligns with some sort of<br>more global physiological so the<br>function is something I don't think<br>anyone's really figured out is endo<br>cannabinoids and colostrum much as this<br>mis palabras milk so and yes I see is in<br>the central reason for you there's<br>another receptor the cb2 receptors<br>immune cell receptor so it does have<br>immune functions as well<br>okay thank you can you pass it forward<br>and you take that and then pass it<br>forward again turnips or the black but<br>yeah thank you both your presentations<br>though that was that was really<br>brilliant really enjoyed it um I just<br>wondered<br>Tori if you had any insight into the<br>thousand dollars that they charge for<br>the set of accent and mean up to<br>California it seems to us and trimming<br>up to the states that is not as<br>expensive up there to buy Sativex<br>it's well I'm not so sure about the set<br>of X but I know other CBD products than<br>other other marketed products that they<br>say if you got an insight toward a<br>thousand dollars and my idea is probably<br>because GW Pharmaceuticals ran a lot of<br>trials on unsteady cervix and I would<br>say that you're trying to recover money<br>for for the eraser I don't know someone<br>who's luckily getting confessional<br>access to a type of drug which actually<br>if I had to pay for it it would be with<br>some people New Zealand have to it's not<br>funded using as thirteen nails so why is<br>that is because it's on paint than the<br>drug companies do yeah because people<br>need it that's what I think so<br>lesser than the states in California<br>what do they pay for the Isetta beans<br>well Sativex is actually not licensed<br>over there it's only 11 all I need<br>trivalent almost nine hours check yeah<br>so side of excess not and what does it<br>cost<br>it's really I think a prescription was<br>five hundred dollars that's what I was<br>told by one doctor who the patients that<br>he prescribes it to this kind of talked<br>about their pay but I think that that's<br>only a month supply I mean it's still<br>expensive mmm it does have more side<br>effects than the whole client stuff<br>because I think we loaded to this before<br>the CBD decreases the psychotropic<br>effects of THC so it's it's always I'm<br>Connor to kind of have good<br>ratios of CBD THC yeah wait we didn't<br>really touch with mister that's right<br>yeah yeah<br>I was in California earlier this month<br>and went into a dispensary out of<br>curiosity so I can try and answer the<br>question but you can buy quite a lot of<br>like oral marijuana and and bath salts<br>for about each product was probably<br>about twenty dollars and I don't know<br>maybe about one day one or two days<br>supply if you're using it ten times a<br>day like this out of X but if you're<br>using it irregularly it's about 20 doses<br>for twenty dollars and it depends where<br>you go and what state and which does<br>sort of I guess products the<br>dispensaries are stocking because it's<br>thanks for having the talk this evening<br>my question and interest is around the<br>neuro protective and neuro<br>anti-inflammatory properties I say this<br>because I'm a researcher and I was<br>researching at the University of<br>Canterbury about 18 months ago<br>and I was involved in a workplace<br>accident and I received a brain injury<br>and I have a diffuse axonal brain injury<br>which generally means that some portions<br>of my brain have started to die and so<br>when you have a brain injury which is<br>it's very important that you reduce the<br>inflammation in your brain so there are<br>recent studies that have shown that CBD<br>in particular have very strong<br>anti-inflammatory properties and that<br>THC may have some neuroprotective<br>properties are either of you willing to<br>speak to that yeah John with this and um<br>so<br>comes back to the function of the system<br>if you take my sweat on mice we've had<br>the cannabinoid cb1 receptor remove<br>knocked out their transgenic and they<br>have an inducer stroke brain it will get<br>about a two or three times worse injury<br>then a wild-type mouse so there is a<br>protective function going on with this<br>system now there's a the question is by<br>putting in an exhaustion Asst agent a<br>drug to activate those receptors are you<br>doing any more they'd already saturate<br>with Indianapolis that's a question so<br>there's been a lot of a lot of research<br>done on this I know referre Michelin it<br>was a discover of THC and an end amide<br>the first we've discovered endo<br>cannabinoid he has a patented drug which<br>I think they're trying to get into<br>clinical trials which has been promising<br>for traumatic head injury and animal<br>tears called H you might know it's of<br>Israel well but it's only for the acute<br>phase now in terms of the the long-term<br>phase the the neuro inflammation I mean<br>there's a lot of we tried to study there<br>we try to use what's called cannabinoid<br>to cb2 receptor agonists which are more<br>trying to get the anti-inflammatory<br>effects we didn't we don't have any<br>Oh so again we know that cannabinoid<br>system is involved in production of new<br>neurons and Europe genesis that parts of<br>the brain when it happens but it so it<br>goes wrong if you take the gene out but<br>that doesn't necessarily translate into<br>okay well there are some questions that<br>are pending that I have we haven't got<br>time for I think we're going to have to<br>call it a halt for the evening I'd like<br>to I'm sure our two speakers will be<br>able to hang around for a little bit<br>longer if but I do notice that some<br>people have having to leave so I just<br>like to thank you both very much for<br>your for what you've offered today and<br>thank you very much for your very<br>personal stories we wish you all the<br>best for your future treatments and and<br>so on and I just like you both all to<br>join with me and think both of our</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
