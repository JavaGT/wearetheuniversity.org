Findings from the study show a link between people’s experience in the earthquake and their levels of fusion, or connection, to Christchurch.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>identity fusion in general is when<br>people feel very close and connected to<br>their society so they feel even that<br>their identity is similar to their<br>society and we found that participants<br>when we asked to tell about the<br>earthquake and to recall the earthquake<br>felt stronger connection to Christchurch<br>when they had more negative affect when<br>they felt more fear as they recalled the<br>earthquake or when they suffered more<br>harm more physical or psychological harm<br>due to the earthquake so fusion is a<br>known measurement for the last let's say<br>10 to 15 years and it includes two<br>components one of them is surgeon van<br>diagrams where you can say how connected<br>you feel to the cities or to whatever<br>you're experimenting on so you can<br>either be separate or getting closer and<br>closer and feel full identification and<br>there's also a verbal measurement in<br>which we asked people how strongly they<br>feel connected to the city how emerged<br>they are of the city if they feel that<br>the city makes them feel stronger or if<br>they contribute to the city so it's a<br>two dimensional animation<br>well we had a few measurements of Carm<br>we asked them how if they were<br>physically or psychologically harmed and<br>how affected they were we also measured<br>if their area that they live in or their<br>home was impacted or destroyed due to<br>the earthquake also about their work<br>area but what we found that was<br>particularly influential and more<br>influential than other measurements was<br>the suffering their emotional and<br>physical suffering that they injured due<br>to the earthquake so people who suffered<br>more physically and psychologically also<br>felt more fused and stronger connections<br>to the city when they recall there<br>we had an interesting finding where we<br>asked participants to say to what extent<br>they felt that God was involved in the<br>earthquake or that the earthquake<br>happened for a reason and we found that<br>participants who attributed more agency<br>or more intention to the earthquake were<br>also - were also more fused to<br>Christchurch so they felt stronger<br>connections to the city this is<br>important for us because usually these<br>kind of studies are conducted when you<br>relate to an out-group kind of threat so<br>when you see there's a terrorist attack<br>or war people tend to fuse and then we<br>say oh it's because they say someone<br>else did it it's an out-group threat and<br>it was interesting to find that<br>intention even when it's a supernatural<br>one influenced how strongly people would</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
