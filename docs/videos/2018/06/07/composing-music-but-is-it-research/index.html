row rocket Adama tena koe tow<br>tena koe tow tena tato katoa<br>my name is Harlan hain and I have the<br>great privilege of being the vice<br>chancellor here at the University of<br>Otago and it is with great pleasure that<br>I welcome you to our very first<br>inaugural professorial lecture for 2018<br>I'd like to begin by welcoming academic<br>staff and students and professional<br>staff from around the University and<br>also members and former members of the<br>University Council who have joined us<br>here this evening I'd like to extend a<br>particularly warm welcome to Professor<br>Richie's friends family and members of<br>the Dunedin music community and the<br>wider community who have all come along<br>this evening to support him on this very<br>auspicious occasion I am sure that your<br>support here is going to be in very very<br>very important to him now often times<br>when I introduce our speaker at these<br>inaugural professorial lectures I<br>sometimes use the word superstar our<br>promotion criterion here at Otago are<br>extremely stringent so in order to<br>achieve the rank of Professor you must<br>be a superstar in teaching in research<br>and in service to the University and to<br>the wider community but tonight in<br>addition to achieving all of those<br>successes professor Ricci actually is a<br>superstar in the traditional sense of<br>the term he is a prolific composer with<br>close to 200 original compositions for<br>both instrument and voice his music has<br>been performed and recorded by top-level<br>artists and ensembles both here in New<br>Zealand and in other parts of the world<br>reviewers of his work have routinely<br>heaped praise on his talent now when we<br>sought external<br>it into our decision-making process<br>about making professor Ricci a professor<br>his referees were unanimous in their<br>laudatory comments we were reminded over<br>and over again that professor Ricci is<br>one of New Zealand's top ranking and<br>internationally established composers I<br>would also like to take this opportunity<br>to publicly thank you for agreeing to<br>compose an anthem for our 150th year<br>celebration next year and I know that I<br>speak on behalf of everyone who is here<br>and the rest of the university community<br>that we are all very much looking<br>forward to hearing that anthem being<br>performed during a gala concert in the<br>Town Hall over Queens birthday weekend<br>so professor Ricci on behalf of the<br>University of Otago I would like to<br>congratulate you on your very<br>well-deserved promotion to Professor and<br>I will now call on associate professor<br>Peter Adams who is going to tell us just<br>a little bit more about your journey to<br>becoming professor<br>noreda tena koe totin okoto tena Tata<br>Tata<br>vice-chancellor deputy vice-chancellors<br>pro vice-chancellor Anthony professors<br>ladies and gentlemen it's my great<br>pleasure to introduce professor Anthony<br>Richie to you and the first thing I'd<br>like to say is that Anthony is I think<br>unique in New Zealand we've already<br>heard that he's written so many<br>compositions but he's also the most<br>performed New Zealand composer behind<br>Douglas Lubin and at this very moment<br>there are rehearsals in place around the<br>country of Anthony's music whether it's<br>an amateur school choir preparing a<br>choral piece for the big singing<br>competition or whether it's the Auckland<br>Philharmonia Orchestra who will be<br>playing his viola concerto later in the<br>year you can guarantee that somewhere<br>Anthony's music is being rehearsed ready<br>to be performed<br>Anthony is also like father like son<br>and this was also a unique aspect of<br>Anthony is that his father was a<br>professor of music and his father was<br>one of the first-generation New Zealand<br>composers John Ritchie and he passed<br>away just a couple of years ago but I<br>know he would have been absolutely<br>delighted and so proud of his son for<br>achieving the same status as a composer<br>and as a professor of music as John<br>Ritchie did and John had a very long<br>career at the University of Canterbury<br>and Anthony is already showing the same<br>sort of longevity in his career here at<br>Otago so Anthony as we've heard as<br>composed actually it's just over 200<br>works now because of course he's written<br>one between he actually wrote one the<br>other day for my birthday so thank you<br>Anthony studied at the University of<br>Canterbury completing a first-class<br>honours in composition and then he<br>furthered his study in the list Academy<br>in Hungary completing a PhD on the<br>Hungarian composer béla bartók and I<br>think a lot of us in Anthony's earlier<br>compositions would recognise the<br>fingerprint of Bartok in his style<br>before he added the cook island drumming<br>in the Pacifica and the rock music to<br>his style he was composer in schools and<br>Christchurch in 1987 he was the Mozart<br>fellow here at Otago University in 1988<br>and again in 1989 and he was the<br>composer in residence with the Dunedin<br>Symphony Orchestra in 1993 to 1994 and<br>then he started his leadership with us<br>in the music department<br>he's freelanced in the early 1990s<br>writing many commissioned works<br>including the flute concerto the viola<br>concerto from the southern marches and<br>two symphonies all of which have been<br>performed and recorded the viola<br>concerto is to be performed in Auckland<br>later this year but something about that<br>cinderella instrument the viola that<br>Anthony likes he's written a second<br>viola concerto which is to be premiered<br>there's at the end of this year or the<br>big league in August this year so that's<br>fantastic<br>he's written music for theater and for<br>dance he's completed three short operas<br>in the 1919 and 90s as well many of his<br>work has been recorded and broadcast and<br>such renowned ensembles as the Ulster<br>orchestra the tacacs quartet soloist set<br>such as Bala Hissar / Alex are still the<br>flute player the BBC Symphony Orchestra<br>has recorded his overture a bugle will<br>do his symphony number four stations and<br>was selected as one of the recordings of<br>the year by music web international in<br>2015 and last year 2016 he was sorry<br>2016 he was the joint winner of the<br>classical album of the year with Ross<br>Harris Wellington composer 4000 in the<br>distance work for clarinet quintet which<br>was recorded by the dalla Collier<br>quintet just recently his oratorio<br>Gallipoli - the Somme was performed last<br>year here in Dunedin and it's about to<br>be performed in London and Oxford and<br>Anthony and our senior lecturer in<br>violin Tessa Petersen who has been<br>invited to lead the orchestra in London<br>and Oxford will be heading off very<br>shortly for those performances which are<br>in June<br>Anthony's also very involved with the<br>local community just a couple of weeks<br>ago he conducted a concert with the<br>Otago symphonic wind band of New Zealand<br>composers for May New Zealand<br>composition nuts another aspect of<br>Anthony is he likes that vicious game of<br>croquet he has been the Otago champions<br>for seven times and he's represented New<br>Zealand at two World Championships one<br>in Florida a member of the New Zealand<br>team in 2009 and then an Adelaide in<br>2012 today his talk is entitled as we<br>can see up above me composing music but<br>is it research we in a composer creates<br>music is he or she doing research<br>Anthony will endeavor to answer this<br>question we'll also taking you on a<br>journey through his life and career he<br>will talk about his creative practice<br>and is striving for a musical voice<br>you'll hear about some of the influences<br>in his life both musical and non-musical<br>he will outline what skills you need to<br>be a composer and these are not all<br>musical the ability and desire to engage<br>with the other arts sciences in life in<br>general is an important part of being a<br>well-rounded composer he will also talk<br>about innovation and the nature of<br>creativity finally he will talk about<br>the creation of knowledge when composing<br>what is that we find out when we listen<br>to new music and along the way of course<br>we're going to hear some of Anthony's<br>music ladies and gentlemen Professor<br>Anthony Richard<br>thank you very much kayako Nui ke Akua<br>he can come here cut sohcahtoa KO Araki<br>t mama ko Waimakariri to our no otter<br>tae-hee ah ho<br>ko Anthony Taku lingua tena koutou tena<br>koutou tena tato Katara<br>welcome vice chancellor pro<br>vice-chancellor staff friends family<br>it's great to see so many familiar faces<br>here I find that some people are puzzled<br>when I tell them that composing music is<br>my main research activity surely<br>creating new music is not form of<br>research where are the words where's the<br>literature review and so forth I hope I<br>can provide answers that will satisfy<br>you that composition is a type of<br>research a way of searching for and<br>discovering new knowledge it's also of<br>course a creative act a form of<br>self-expression and an activity that<br>requires substantial self-discipline<br>but first I'll share my research journey<br>with you how I came to compose music<br>some of my influences and how I came to<br>work at this university many composers<br>through history have enjoyed working in<br>tertiary institutions although it's a<br>more recent trend relatively speaking<br>one of the reasons we had the glorious<br>New World Symphony of Dvorak is that he<br>took up a job at the National<br>Conservatory of Music in New York where<br>who's paid 10 times as much as back in<br>bohemia' the great 20th century composer<br>Arnold Schoenberg shared his knowledge<br>in a book called fundamentals of musical<br>composition which grew out of his<br>teaching at Californian universities so<br>if the gradual decline in aristocratic<br>petrich academies and couldn't serve<br>attires became more natural homes for<br>composers allowing them to balance the<br>creative solitude or for sharing of<br>knowledge with their students so after a<br>decade of freelancing I to join the<br>ranks of composers and universities and<br>have never regretted it<br>I was fortunate enough to be born into a<br>musical family as you've heard already<br>from Peter the fifth of five children I<br>was born in Christchurch my mother was a<br>singer a soprano of some renown singing<br>solos and Messiah and so forth his<br>singing was a constant companion to me<br>to my early life and I can blame her for<br>my habit of singing and having all the<br>time which drives my wife spear however<br>I can think of for this to there's been<br>research to show that exposure to music<br>and early life is crucial than the<br>development of musicality and I think<br>the exposure to music - singing in<br>particular is especially powerful my<br>mother also started me on the piano and<br>showed constant faith in my musical<br>abilities she was of a generation who<br>would have had a more substantial career<br>herself we were it not for raising five<br>of us my father as Peter said was also a<br>composer and a professor he died 2014<br>and I'm very sorry that he didn't live<br>to see this day he was an alumnus of<br>Otago completing a music degree in just<br>two years during World War two before<br>being sent off to Europe as a fighter<br>pilot he had the good fortune to go to<br>us to go to school at King in with<br>technical we're a musician by the name<br>of Vernon Griffiths was undertaking an<br>extraordinary experiment he made all the<br>students at the school learn a musical<br>instrument and sing in the choir<br>no exceptions I can't imagine that<br>happening these days there they all are<br>somewhere in this photo<br>my parents they meet at King Edward Tech<br>and both became immersed in music at<br>school my father learnt the cornet B<br>flat base the keyboard and the clarinet<br>he showed musical aptitude and Vernon<br>encouraged him to compose and conduct as<br>well and after the war my parents<br>settled in Christchurch we're dead<br>during the Department of Music at<br>Cambridge so most people when they hear<br>this say you're following in your<br>footsteps<br>can't be denied I suppose however I can<br>truthfully say that my mother and<br>siblings had a more direct influence on<br>me when I was young than my father it<br>simple reason being that Dave was so<br>busy that he was often away we spent<br>many long hours around the old valve<br>gramophone record player here it is we<br>sold it the other day for $15 on trade<br>me very sad day so my brother and I we<br>had an eclectic mix of LPS ranging from<br>Shostakovich and Sibelius through direct<br>city and blue and t-rex in in my teens<br>my sister lives returned home and added<br>show music to the repertoire cabaret<br>fiddler on the roof and so forth I spent<br>long hours listened to the radio to the<br>gramophone and hammering on the piano so<br>much so that I regularly broke strings<br>on it I found it more interesting to<br>improvise then learning my set pieces<br>and this was the beginning of my<br>composing around age 11 there is a<br>saying about a person helping to spend a<br>thousand hours learning a skill before<br>they produce quality work and I want to<br>thank my family very much for allowing<br>me that time and space to create at the<br>piano in a teenager must have been times<br>when it drove them up the wall likewise<br>my father tolerated me pinching his<br>manuscript paper out of his office to<br>write music<br>he didn't impose lessons on me - I think<br>this is interesting he he waited till I<br>was 16 or 17 before giving me some<br>harmony lessons which I found very<br>difficult<br>incidentally up till this point I just<br>listened to music and and played it and<br>my favorites were 20th century composers<br>like Bartok Stravinsky Shostakovich<br>Schoenberg and the gt' in other words<br>when I was young I liked dissonance<br>my brother-in-law called at that bloody<br>awful music he is an extract from my<br>opus 1 for solo violin dating from 1976<br>when I was in the fifth form which shows<br>this tendency towards distance now the<br>violinist here most of you will<br>recognize the Sidney monoliths who<br>taught at<br>Tiger University back in these days back<br>in the 80s and he picked up the sonata<br>of mine and it's quite remarkable that<br>he played it and recorded it for the<br>radio completely office out of his own<br>volition and it's a recording I treasure<br>just one little bit having a musical<br>family around meant the idea of becoming<br>a musician didn't seem weird in fact I<br>really didn't consider any other career<br>path to be honest so I studied at<br>Canterbury University while my father<br>was still teaching here there no that<br>was a little weird but he endeavored to<br>keep an object of distance between us<br>the times I found most valuable with him<br>we were when we were attending concerts<br>and talking about this or that composer<br>and there's all that peace I grew up at<br>a time of turmoil for the Arts and<br>general the post-war period up to the<br>80s will be remembered as a time when<br>everything was questioned even the very<br>definition of music in New Zealand there<br>was a flourishing interest in electro<br>acoustic music for example where it was<br>no performer it was a reel-to-reel tape<br>playing at the same time many composers<br>were still happy to can write continue<br>writing melodies and harmonies as before<br>by the 1980s the range of musical styles<br>and approaches within the classical<br>world was buu Aldrin lead verse as John<br>Cage put it the history of music in the<br>20th century is like a river delta<br>spreading out and ever greater number of<br>streams and this was reflected by the<br>types of teachers our head it was my<br>father he wanted me to stay sane in a<br>mad world see poet<br>my third-year teacher John Cousins<br>heavily into experimentation with a<br>liking for electronic music and<br>performance art my fourth year teacher<br>Chloe moon who tried a mid path middle<br>path between the conservative and the<br>radical and finally when I went to<br>Budapest to study I had composition<br>lessons with Attila Banzai a quiet<br>intellectual composer who pushed me<br>towards an atonal style of music so as a<br>student I tried to embrace all these<br>diverse elements but found I was in<br>danger of losing my individuality in<br>fact it was John cousins who encouraged<br>me to block out too many influences and<br>just to focus on what was special about<br>what I did and I think in today's<br>globally connected world it's more<br>important than ever for artists to<br>develop their own ideas and to treasure<br>them and not to be overwhelmed by too<br>many influences my PhD as Peter said was<br>on the hungarian composer béla bartók<br>and involved tracing the influence of<br>folk music in his work this exercise of<br>analyzing folk music and how it's used<br>had a profound effect on my own work the<br>idea that folk music is like flora and<br>fauna constantly evolving and changing<br>over time really interested me so I<br>tried to do this in my own compositions<br>I wrote a work called a folk lament<br>which combines the elements of Mary<br>water of Hungarian lament I wrote it for<br>organ of all things and it won a prize<br>resulting in performances and a<br>broadcast by Dane Julian we're the style<br>of this music is atonal as I mentioned<br>that's what I was heading towards that<br>as music without a key Center my keys<br>which reflected my teaching however I<br>never really felt comfortable working in<br>the style and when I came back home I<br>head back to turn allottee one of the<br>results of this was by concertino for<br>piano and strings written for Otago<br>alumnus Sharon joy bogan this had the<br>honor of being recorded onto an LP in<br>1984 just before cassettes totally took<br>over<br>and this in turn led to commissions for<br>the Auckland Philharmonia and this<br>helped my cause when it came time to<br>applying for the Mozart fellowship this<br>was my first contact with Otago in<br>Dunedin the Mozart fellowship was a<br>dream come true a chance to spend all<br>year composing music and being paid for<br>it it also allowed me to make<br>connections with a new city<br>playing piano bobstine was in the<br>picture getting to know composers Jack<br>Spears Peter Adams and John Drummond<br>see John's here I was encouraged by the<br>music department to do some teaching and<br>discovered I had a love for sharing<br>knowledge with young people<br>unfortunately my second year as mates at<br>Farrow was not so happy with a marriage<br>breakup and sometimes composing can be<br>good therapy and other times it's the<br>last thing you feel like doing<br>I had a commission at the time if I had<br>deadlines from the Dunedin symphonia as<br>it was called in and Nicholas McBride<br>was in charge of it then and he asked me<br>to write a piece for your opening<br>concert of 1989 following a period of<br>chaos I managed to write this commission<br>in two weeks a result the resulting<br>piece was called the hanging bulb<br>eventually published by missing<br>university priests and although it's a<br>deeply unhappy and personal piece it's<br>been kind to me<br>after the premiere it was picked up by a<br>workshop by the Auckland Philharmonia<br>recorded onto CD by the New Zealand<br>Symphony Orchestra and that recording<br>session was an experience I'll never<br>forget<br>the CD had a limited budget which meant<br>limited time with the orchestra in fact<br>they picked up the music for the first<br>time of this 15 minute piece at 2:00<br>o'clock and finished recording it by 4<br>o'clock as time was nearly up the<br>conductor Qingyang was still trying to<br>get a particular rhythm right I was<br>biting my nails and the recording<br>producer was yelling come on come on<br>fortunately the recording made it by the<br>skin of its teeth and I offer this is a<br>story as an example of her fragile music<br>business can be depending on<br>circumstances and lucky breaks the<br>hanging bulb reached a much larger<br>audience as a result of this recording<br>became a set work for NCEA students were<br>a resource made by Sheryl kam a former<br>mates a fellow here and ever since this<br>resource was adopted I've been fielding<br>questions from high school students<br>asking what the piece is about the<br>painting on the cover is by New Zealand<br>a Philip Claremont a very talented<br>artist who sadly died in the seventies<br>over from a series of vibrant interior<br>paintings that usually feature light<br>bulbs in response to the music tries to<br>suggest brightness by the high sounding<br>woodlands and simultaneously a sense of<br>despair through falling motifs and<br>harmonies that seem locked into repeated<br>rhythms<br>following the Mozart fellowship I<br>decided to stay in Dunedin and it was<br>the best decision that I ever made<br>first of all I met my second wife to be<br>sandy he's been a wonderful partner for<br>me for 25 years and secondly Dunedin<br>offer plenty opportunities for a<br>musician our happily freelance through<br>the decade and stayed in touch with the<br>University getting to know a string of<br>interesting Mozart fairly such as<br>Gillian might eat and also made a living<br>from a succession of commissioned works<br>some residency's a little teaching some<br>conducting reviewing and judging I was<br>lucky enough during this period to have<br>taught ticklin evens and Holly Madison<br>and Michael Norris have gone on to<br>bigger and better things and Peter<br>mentioned the southern marches that was<br>a significant work for me written to<br>celebrate the hundred and fiftieth<br>anniversary of Otago and Southland I<br>also did the southern journeys which is<br>a music for a Natural History Museum<br>film the one that played in the airport<br>for many many years the stopped at<br>recently for me though my heart late<br>with symphonic writing it's been a dream<br>of mine since young to write a symphony<br>so when I was appointed composer in<br>residence with the Dunedin Sinfonia in<br>93 I seize the opportunity it's the<br>first page of my Symphony number one<br>first page of 200 which and I hand wrote<br>and got Paris I as a result symphony<br>boom as it's called I demonstrate<br>several areas that I was exploring at<br>the time in my work first of all<br>synthesizing small melodic fragments and<br>to a coherent whole also I was<br>interested in returning to a simpler<br>style away from my Bartok based more<br>deep style thirdly<br>I was interested in popular music at the<br>stage so there's some influences from<br>jazz and rock cumin and the influence of<br>some Eastern philosophy now Marla and<br>Sibelius once famously disagreed about<br>what the nature of a symphony should be<br>Sebelius said he<br>mired the symphony's profound logic and<br>interconnection Marla disagreed by<br>saying a symphony must be like the world<br>must embrace everything now I wanted<br>boom to bring these two ideas together<br>some air so I adopted the idea of<br>Sebelius's synthesis of motifs and at<br>the same time I wanted to make a<br>statement about life the universe and<br>everything so the title boom Bo um comes<br>from en Foster's novel A Passage to<br>India and as a haunting echo that is<br>represented in the music by the tempting<br>or the gong which is the instrument you<br>see behind me in that photo the<br>recurring boom symbolizes for me at<br>least the extinguishing of the ego the<br>self the realization that we humans are<br>but a tiny speck in the natural order of<br>things the eastern concept of samsara or<br>reincarnation is also woven into the<br>music with ideas and sounds being<br>recycled as you may be able to tell from<br>this description I'm interested in prog<br>music that as instrumental music that<br>has meanings or messages in them and<br>this approach has been criticized by<br>those who prefer absolute music or art<br>for art's sake<br>you see prog music is offense full and<br>romantic or as Copeland said almost<br>childlike my belief in the power of prog<br>music has come about through absolute<br>observing the reactions of non musicians<br>to musical experiences purely<br>instrumental music Ken's two powerful<br>emotions and images I think think of the<br>searing sonorities of barbers famous<br>Adagio for Strings well the power and<br>drama are Beethoven's fifth symphony<br>first movement or the sheer joy of<br>living in our Gershwin's Rhapsody in<br>Blue<br>as listeners we all develop our own<br>associations with purely instrumental<br>music so I prefer to describe my music<br>as simi programmatic that is I create an<br>idea specific ID on my own mind and put<br>it into the music but they knew the<br>listener can either take it or leave it<br>you can listen to it just as pure music<br>if you wish and this is the beauty of<br>music<br>after all it's open to many<br>interpretations<br>in my Symphony bomb I also tried to<br>develop a more simple direct style so as<br>to make these emotions more apparent and<br>this was partly informed by my<br>experiences in the early in 1990s when I<br>connected with live popular music at<br>Sammy's the over dams and other venues I<br>sort of had the the adolescence I never<br>had I felt the need to get in touch with<br>the cathartic experience of rock<br>concerts and this led me to be somewhat<br>dissatisfied with the culture<br>surrounding classical music the<br>formality of concerts the restrained<br>emotional responses and the intellection<br>approach to composition that I observed<br>amongst some of my peers so technically<br>my music becomes less dense dissonant<br>and simpler and style here's just a<br>little bit of Symphony bombed towards<br>the end getting near the climax of the<br>piece and my mind it was like a rock<br>concert<br>doesn't really sound like music sense<br>bomb I've written three more symphonies<br>and have a fifth in draft form at the<br>moment which hopefully will be performed<br>in the newly rebuilt crushed each Town<br>Hall next year and these and other<br>symphonies I've explored themes related<br>to politics history psychology religion<br>disasters childhood around 2000 I began<br>to explore some new directions man in my<br>musical style and did so via a set of 24<br>preludes for piano which eventually got<br>recorded onto CD by Sharon Bergen and<br>this involved methods I hadn't tried<br>before such as the tone clock method in<br>some meth medics coincidentally at this<br>time I also accepted a half-time<br>contract at the University here which<br>led to a permanent job and I guess this<br>takes me back to the question I posed at<br>the start but as at research this will<br>be my light motif my recurring theme for<br>the rest of the talk I would like to<br>show why I think composition is a form<br>of research when a composer works they<br>create new sounds they do this for their<br>own creative pleasure and a<br>self-expression but they also do it as a<br>form of communication to impart<br>something to you people the audience the<br>composer has no control over the how the<br>sounds will be received we talk about<br>the audience as if it's a unit but of<br>course it's made up of many individuals<br>with many different personalities<br>experiences and of course you all hear<br>different things and music here's a nice<br>parallel to what I'm saying from a<br>chapter on the psychological and<br>physiological aspects of hearing by JD<br>what we said it's worth remembering that<br>when the hi-fi enthusiasts<br>striving for perfection with the<br>sophisticated equipment twiddles has<br>knobs and dials all he's doing is to<br>impose upon what he hears a quality<br>which he finds has he had been pleasing<br>to himself so likewise I twiddle the<br>knobs and dials of my compositions and<br>try to communicate with the audience but<br>in the end what they take out of it is<br>over to them<br>moreover I would say music is not a<br>universal language despite the global<br>spread of Western popular music it is<br>culturally defined therefore an order<br>for my music to connect there has to be<br>a set of shared musical signals with the<br>audience and in order to develop these<br>shared signals a composer has to be part<br>of a community and its musical to use<br>the word of Kristoff's small to reach a<br>stage this stage a composer has to have<br>mastered the craft of composition so as<br>before any researcher there are a wide<br>range of technical skills required<br>before any significant creative work can<br>be done and I thought it might be just<br>worth pointing these out the mastering<br>of a musical instrument was very<br>important the ability to improvise<br>fluently mastering of a written musical<br>language musical notation development of<br>an inner ear through lots and lots of<br>listening<br>ideally singing as well in school<br>reading the ability to sight read<br>fluently on an instrument is incredibly<br>valuable for a composer and finally the<br>development of an aesthetic through many<br>repeated listening to music and<br>sometimes the same piece of music over<br>and over and over again all this leads<br>to what Zachary Dunbar calls know how<br>the knowledge that has built up inside<br>us through formal practice so that we<br>operate instinctively with it like<br>riding a bike<br>this accumulated instinctive knowledge<br>is essential for the development of a<br>musical voice or style all good and well<br>but wires at research when I sit down<br>and write a new piece of music my<br>research I'm certainly creating<br>something new that didn't exist before<br>an original composition is opposed to a<br>plagiarized one<br>but there is experimentation and new<br>knowledge is the experimentation and new<br>knowledge being created well I'd say if<br>my musical style had stayed the same as<br>my opus one violin sonata they know you<br>couldn't claim that my composition was<br>research creative artists have to try<br>new approaches and methods to what<br>innovate I'll come back to the word<br>innovation shortly but it is worth<br>pointing out historically that some of<br>the greatest composers have written to<br>order be up to the church patron or<br>theater and have often stuck to a<br>formula for efficiency sake so not every<br>one of Rossini's 39 operas are original<br>masterpieces and one could argue that<br>most of them these days wouldn't qualify<br>as research because we're in all<br>likelihood dashed off in a hurry in<br>following a formula however recomposing<br>similar ideas trying them out in<br>different contexts is actually a natural<br>part of composing just as jazz musicians<br>take an idea and play around with it so<br>composers develop their ideas through<br>lots of repetition they develop their<br>voice<br>the musical DNA it's not a sign of<br>laziness but rather it can be seen as a<br>composers preference for certain<br>patterns a collection of these<br>preferences develops into a style or an<br>ascetic the analogy I would make is<br>there of a scientist who sits out with a<br>hypothesis and has to run an experiment<br>several times maybe with different<br>conditions to produce slightly different<br>results each time this leads me back to<br>the question of innovation a word that's<br>much used in art circles and as the<br>cornerstone of funding agencies such as<br>creative museum<br>innovation and research go hand in hand<br>but innovation is a surprisingly tricky<br>concept to pen down in the arts for<br>example every composer I know his<br>influences and the music can sound<br>somewhat similar to someone else there<br>are many examples of composers creating<br>themes that are rather similar to each<br>others in his book on composition sure<br>big highlights three three of these one<br>by Mozart<br>theme from his forty of Symphony one by<br>Beethoven this is one of his eerie piano<br>sonatas and one by Mendelssohn a string<br>quartet so do we need to get the lawyers<br>in that's not at all<br>Beethoven a Mendelssohn were both<br>influenced generally by Mozart and the<br>similarities of these themes are<br>probably subconscious rather than a<br>deliberate borrowing when you are<br>thoroughly immersed in a rich musical<br>culture ideas tend to be pinged around a<br>lot and shared and in any case what<br>Beethoven amounts a meddlesome did with<br>the themes was very different to might<br>say after World War two composers and<br>artists turned themselves upside down in<br>a search for innovation any conceivable<br>noise or sound could be employed or you<br>could have a completely silent piece so<br>when it comes down to it however the<br>thing that will distinguish one composer<br>from another is a collection of<br>aesthetic choices the composer makes and<br>not necessarily whether there is a great<br>novelty in each piece so I think<br>innovation can be better defined as an<br>attitude that sees this I'm personally<br>willing to try things I haven't tried<br>willingness to change willingness to try<br>different methods is something we see in<br>the greatest artists in composers<br>Beethoven is a good example in the music<br>world Picasso is a good example in the<br>visual world enjoys in the literary<br>world they were what we would call blue<br>sky thinkers the willingness to change<br>and innovate and composition is<br>something that we might associate more<br>tangibly with research in my own work<br>I've tried these are three examples as<br>medical concepts as I mentioned before<br>using magic squares and golden ratio to<br>structure pieces now these are not my<br>inventions they've been used by other<br>composers but they were new for me<br>transcription and recomposition is<br>another method<br>that I've used so for example recording<br>birdcall transcribing the bird called<br>down we even get him to a piece of music<br>in minimalism so the reduction of music<br>to its basics and this has been a trend<br>in music in the last 30 years and it's<br>influenced me through performance as as<br>well as academic research even my method<br>of composing has changed in the last 30<br>or 20 years since buying my first<br>program for a computer<br>my wife sandy who's a tick was helped me<br>to set up an acorn computer for the<br>Sibelius version one in 1994 following<br>that bout of our sio mentioned excellent<br>actually it was much kinder on the hands<br>and since then the playback function has<br>improved and it's now possible to get a<br>reasonable idea of how the piece<br>actually sounds before being performed<br>it also allows for some experimentation<br>in the music score as it unfolds I<br>thought it might be interesting to show<br>an extract of music that I did on the<br>MIDI on the computer first of all and<br>then what it sounded like in performance<br>live the extract I've chosen is from<br>Gallipoli to the psalm which Peter<br>mentioned before one of the first<br>courses sang by said he didn't acquired<br>the needin and of course there's<br>aleene's symphony orchestra company it<br>all paid to Atari Sir apirana Ngata<br>woods for the first Maori battalion so<br>it's probably enough of that those are<br>the voices but of course they don't they<br>haven't developed the skill of mimicking<br>widget or at least I don't think so<br>here's the real thing<br>so a composition that puts new ideas<br>into practice can be viewed as a more<br>tangible form of research I think Dunbar<br>talks about a purposeful dialogue<br>between theory and practice<br>resulting in practice as research and<br>this is now the model that is encouraged<br>for creative DMAs and PhDs at the<br>University and it allows composers and<br>performers to undertake postgraduate<br>study involved in both their practice<br>and the academic research for example<br>one of my DMA students Trevor common but<br>for a theory about organizing music and<br>two cycles of rhythms and meters and<br>then put this theory into practice for<br>free innovative albums of music I've<br>noticed another change in my own method<br>in recent years I like to take longer<br>thinking about the creative work to be<br>done<br>the part of the thinking involves<br>research in reading I've just mentioned<br>gallipoli to the psalm and this is an<br>obvious example to use here too the<br>preparation for this work involved quite<br>a lot of things obviously reading the<br>book of the same name by Alexander<br>Aitken the soldier who went to Gallipoli<br>ends on researching his background and<br>his friends meeting his friends and<br>relatives also researching other texts<br>related to the First World War poems<br>latest Diaries which then I see it too -<br>music building a structure out of those<br>different texts it also involved talking<br>to war hit War historians Chris Pugsley<br>Kate Kennedy and others and archivists<br>like David Murray helped me look at some<br>old war music and consultation with<br>people in my own department Rob burns<br>who look kindly loaned me a material<br>suzanne little all these things and in<br>fact I'm now working on a book chapter<br>on the on the theme of how war is<br>represented in arts and music portrayal<br>I like to spend time also thinking about<br>the actual performance I am writing for<br>so classical composers do not generally<br>play all the instruments they write for<br>they some have tried but as they<br>research their capabilities and<br>characteristics however there is a<br>danger of becoming divorced from real<br>performers especially in these days of<br>computer playback midis and so forth<br>therefore I like to stay connected with<br>the performers as much as possible in<br>Gallipoli to the some for example I<br>worked with the orchestra's<br>concertmaster Tessa Peterson on her solo<br>part and adopted suggestions she made<br>because after all she knows her<br>instrument a lot better than I did and<br>therefore this process of composition is<br>not necessarily solitary it's in fact<br>I've enjoyed many happy collaborations<br>over the years with other colleagues<br>Helene did Percy Terence Denis Tom<br>McGraw<br>John Van Buskirk Peter Adams many others<br>who sorry for I haven't mentioned people<br>but it's been a joy one of the joys of<br>being a composer is working with so many<br>talented musicians here's another one<br>particular Nivens conducting a recording<br>session me<br>so far I've talked about my creative<br>practice the development of the musical<br>voice striving for innovation the<br>thinking and researching that informs my<br>work in collaboration with other artists<br>I would like to return to one of the<br>questions I asked at the start which was<br>where is the new knowledge in order to<br>qualify as research it could be argued<br>composition should produce new knowledge<br>and impassive to the audience now when<br>music collaborates with the other arts<br>the literature for example it's much<br>clearer to grasps where that new<br>knowledge might lie<br>I've enjoyed many fruitful<br>collaborations with writers over the<br>years for example my opera this other<br>Eden was a collaboration of Michael and<br>Forster and this opera reveals<br>narratives from 1820s New Zealand and<br>biculturalism but suddenly new lives<br>however when no text is involved when<br>the music is purely instrumental how to<br>regain you knowledge then I think we<br>have to apply a broaden a definition of<br>what knowledge is here's one from the<br>Oxford Dictionary awareness or<br>familiarity gained by experience of<br>effect or situation very simple one but<br>experiencing an instrumental piece of<br>music and concept can lead to a new<br>awareness I believe this is more likely<br>to be an emotional awareness than a<br>cognitive one feelings rather than facts<br>although I have to say musicians can and<br>do listen to music as an intellectual<br>exercise and analyzing harmonies and<br>structures as they go exactly what we've<br>become aware of though in when listening<br>can be intangible because as I said<br>before instrumental music is not<br>specific and its meaning hints it's<br>difficult to talk about specific<br>knowledge being gained however I think<br>music at its best can help create<br>narratives in our minds to help us<br>contemplate our lives or contemplate<br>issues or release emotions that may be<br>lurking below the surface in other words<br>it can help us to know ourselves in the<br>relation our relationship with the world<br>I also think music in the arts reside on<br>what I call the shadows of doubt that is<br>they deal with both tangible knowledge<br>and intangible knowledge my teacher John<br>Cousins once compared composers to<br>shamans saying the a role in society was<br>somewhat similar to the old peoples of<br>spiritual knowledge whereas the sciences<br>focus on ret the rational the arts deal<br>with both the rational and the<br>irrational they deal and tell their<br>question and challenge us delve into<br>uncertainty and doubt as well as<br>providing pleasurable and meaningful<br>experiences and ease knowledge I've just<br>finished reading a fascinating book by<br>Steven Pinker enlightenment now in which<br>he advocates for the humanities and<br>science is coming closer together for<br>their mutual benefit and I have to say I<br>agree I think this is probably a way<br>another important part of research is<br>reflection after a premiere I reflect on<br>my creation to see if it succeeds look<br>for improvements so I developed some<br>self-knowledge in other words I can<br>learn a lot from the physical reality of<br>a performance the people around me in<br>the audience the nature of the<br>performance and the acoustic all these<br>can influence my own perception of<br>whether the music has worked or not I'm<br>also interested in what performers and<br>listeners think so I talked to them and<br>I also regarded as part of my research<br>to find out what other people think and<br>this includes reading reviews now this<br>is not always easy there's some critics<br>like to criticize my piano concertino<br>was once described as having a slight<br>but genuine lyrical charm and some<br>cleanly rinsed memories and the oak<br>trees odd you call them so as a 24 year<br>old this hit somewhat but then on the<br>other hand it's very nice to be affirmed<br>by the critics and of course I take<br>these all think these things to hurt and<br>think about them 30 years later when my<br>Symphony 1 and 2 were released on CD the<br>British reviewer Nick banner had made<br>the summary of my musical style which is<br>unusual to get a big review like this<br>and he finished it in this way he<br>strikes me as a part of a small elite<br>group of composers who found a personal<br>musical language that takes elements of<br>contemporary musical culture with a<br>classical if Nick or popular and fuses<br>them into works that speak with a<br>relevance and depth to audiences who<br>might otherwise feel contemporary music<br>was too unapproachable<br>whichis music speaks with a very<br>individual yet accessible voice I wish I<br>had a dollar for the number of times my<br>musics been described as accessible but<br>the implication of this course is that a<br>lot of contemporary classical music<br>isn't their accessible and sometimes<br>this often seems to be true my music is<br>accessible because it uses some<br>materials that people are familiar with<br>from the past melodic lines triatic bass<br>chords pulse bass rhythms<br>doesn't sit in the minimalist camp or<br>the complexity camp which are two<br>significant trends in the last 30 years<br>classical music itself isn't constantly<br>evolving and adapting and despite rumors<br>of its death it maintains a vibrant life<br>and for me the key to classical music's<br>health is a willingness to engage with<br>its audiences in my own music I want to<br>invite new people in I don't see the<br>Meerut and snubbing you I think I still<br>want to make strong statements about<br>what it is to be human and I want people<br>to think about issues but I also want<br>them to enjoy the sounds I guess a good<br>example of this coming back to Galilee<br>to the psalm is the song Ellen's vigil<br>in which I am to make very simple so<br>that the the message is got across very<br>clearly and in this another recent works<br>I've been exploring the idea of a type<br>of artistic naivety almost as a way of<br>conveying strong messages so let's have<br>a little listen to Ellen's vigil just<br>the first part<br>sewing beautifully bill one of one of<br>I hope I've convinced you today that<br>composition is a form of research and<br>then it contributes to a body of<br>knowledge I feel very lucky to have had<br>such a good network of musicians and<br>supporters here in Dunedin New Zealand<br>and overseas I'm looking forward to the<br>performances of Gallipoli to the Somme<br>in London and Oxford in June and I think<br>the University for these support for me<br>going here I want to thank the academic<br>and general staff and the Department of<br>Music Theatre Performing Arts for all<br>their support over the years<br>composing can be a lonely job at times<br>like any form of research and projects<br>can seem to take forever to come to<br>fruition so research has really do<br>appreciate being reminded occasionally<br>that what they do is worthwhile even<br>though people from outside might not<br>assume we need that type of boosting I<br>want to thank my family for all their<br>support - and finally I want to thank<br>the University for its support over 18<br>years showing faith in what I do<br>tena koutou katoa my name is Tony<br>Valentine and on the pro-vice-chancellor<br>humanities and it's really with great<br>pleasure that I deliver this votive<br>thanks to Professor Richie Anthony has<br>delivered I think a truly excellent<br>lecture providing us with rich insights<br>into the development of his musical<br>sensibility<br>and taking us on the journey with him<br>through the development of his<br>composition practice he's offered an<br>engaging and I have to say extremely<br>humble set of reflections on the<br>significance of his work I also think<br>that Anthony's lecture has demonstrated<br>many of the qualities that make him such<br>a respected figure in our arts community<br>as well as in the university and I think<br>the warmth of your applause underscores<br>that he is thoughtful he is imaginative<br>and he's engaging he has offered us a<br>compelling set of reflections on the<br>interplay between the creative arts in<br>society I think in a really compelling<br>fashion I was particularly struck by<br>Anthony's rectification of his early<br>life and his pathway into composition<br>and I think there is real value in<br>hearing such narratives<br>scholars researchers and composers are<br>not born born fully formed they are<br>shaped by complex and shifting sets of<br>personal relationships accidents of time<br>and place and in the case of composers<br>as Anthony showing us the development of<br>a distinctive is theatre which develops<br>over time through their engagement with<br>a range of traditions through reading<br>through personal exploration and of<br>course in the case of music through<br>listening practicing and performing and<br>as he's showing over time they home and<br>rework a unique voice produced by the<br>accumulation of choices that they've<br>made thus has offered us a kind of sneak<br>peek into his creative practice but is<br>clear that it isn't all a matter of<br>looking pensive<br>and then being moved by lightning bolts<br>of inspiration but rather involves<br>knowledge experimentation and a lot of<br>hard work so I would ask you to join me<br>in thanking and congratulating Anthony<br>and and celebrating his promotion to<br>Professor I have a small gift to present<br>to him but I would also like to invite<br>you all to accompany the academic party<br>to the staff tab and to join Anthony in<br>this very special occasion so thank you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
