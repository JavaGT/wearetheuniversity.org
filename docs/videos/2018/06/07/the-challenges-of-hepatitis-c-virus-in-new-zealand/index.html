a<br>fascinating topic that is I've watched<br>with interest over the last thirty plus<br>years from you know a mystery sort of<br>non-a non-b hepatitis to something that<br>that we realized the full extent of the<br>problem and then have moved on to<br>actually effective treatments so it's<br>actually been like not that long 30<br>years to actually understand there's a<br>mystery there's a real problem right<br>through to this potential solutions<br>unfortunate they probably do cost a bit<br>of money anyway Steve Johnson from the<br>Department of Medicine very welcome to<br>come talk to us today about hepatitis C<br>that was all a little better so I think<br>the the interesting thing about this<br>virus has gone from a mystery disease to<br>one that we is curable and so really we<br>won the game I think we should have won<br>the game but I'm not sure we have so<br>we're going to talk about today in the<br>short time is I'm going to discuss some<br>of the natural history of hepatitis C<br>we're going to talk about the<br>epidemiology of hepatitis C both<br>worldwide and in New Zealand they fought<br>briefly about treatment options it gets<br>really boring really fast and I start<br>talking about a lot of drugs<br>Heflin I probably can't even pronounce<br>right I talk about barriers to treatment<br>why have we not won the game and that's<br>really the focus of this talk and then<br>briefly you need to have a national<br>strategy to eliminate the virus and how<br>could we do that<br>so we're going to come from and when I<br>was preparing for this talk I had a<br>moment where I asked myself I've heard<br>nothing about the history of this virus<br>I don't know how old it is<br>how would it come from and so I started<br>delving into the later sure bottom line<br>we don't really know we think it came<br>from sub-saharan Africa probably<br>originated 500 to 2,000 years ago that's<br>a pretty big range not brief precise but<br>that's as close as I can find the in<br>literature is recently called non-a<br>non-b hepatitis and that's what it was<br>called when I was a student but also the<br>interesting thing about this disease is<br>it is a disease caused by doctors and<br>healthcare collage degree it's spread<br>all over the world because of vaccines<br>and medical treatment vaccines for<br>yellow fever of measles<br>a tie schistosomiasis unsterile needles<br>before people really understood yatta<br>sterilized needles before you use them<br>but so this is a largely a degree of<br>modernization and war<br>so when with war became transfusions<br>massive migration so people moved around<br>and the virus spread quite a bit in the<br>past hundred years just in the wars<br>it was first cloned and identified in<br>1989 for those of you remember 1989 it<br>wasn't that long ago just to remind you<br>that's when Timothy Dalton was<br>double-oh-seven and licensed to kill<br>Dead Poets Society was a the big movie<br>and they were saw it but it was really<br>popular and most importantly Bill &amp;<br>Ted's Excellent Adventure came out<br>that's my favorite one so we'll just<br>briefly talk about the hepatitis C virus<br>it's an envelope RNA virus what's a<br>fragile virus it cloaks itself in your<br>own cell membranes as part of the way it<br>invades your immune system it wraps<br>itself in your own cell membranes your<br>own proteins and it circulates you to<br>free bound to lipoproteins antibodies<br>it's a just all over the place and this<br>is a photo mark micrographs of the<br>actuals Hep C virus always like to look<br>my enemy in the eye if I'm going to<br>treat them or try to attack it and<br>that's the hepatitis C virus so and this<br>is an awful slide and I put up here for<br>really one reason that's it that's as<br>complicated as hepatitis C gifts right<br>there it's one strain of RNA it'll<br>translate that whole strand into protein<br>then how you slice up that protein you<br>get two different pieces parts of the<br>hepatitis C it's only about ten<br>different proteins that matter and the<br>really important thing is these three<br>non structural proteins which are<br>basically involved in viral replication<br>that are the targets for all of our<br>therapeutics and I'll point out that<br>there's an NS three which is a serine<br>protease<br>that cuts up the big protein molecule<br>into the different pieces parts there's<br>the NS 5a which is like an RNA binding<br>site in the NS 5b which is an RNA<br>dependent RNA polymerase that's it those<br>are the targets we have period so every<br>therapeutic you see is going to involve<br>one of those tooth one of those three<br>things with the exception arrived a<br>Biron or interferon which are not as<br>important nowadays as they have been so<br>the other thing that's interesting about<br>this virus is it mutates like crazy one<br>air every ten thousand two hundred<br>thousand nucleotides so it's making<br>non-viable variants all the time the<br>half-life is 45 minutes for the virion<br>think about that are slowly living<br>forty-five minutes you make ten to the<br>twelfth new baryons per day you know<br>average personal chronic hepatitis C so<br>what are these people are tired there's<br>a cranking out viruses like there's no<br>tomorrow it's divided into genotypes and<br>genotypes are only important because it<br>affects response to treatments there's<br>six major genotypes we're not going to<br>delve too far into those things but<br>there's lots of subtypes and basically<br>they determine response to treatment so<br>far but that's changing so what happens<br>if if you guys all go out and share<br>needles tonight and one of you has<br>hepatitis C so you're all going to get<br>infected tonight well about 80% of you<br>will develop chronic hepatitis C<br>somewhere between 60 and 85 percent I<br>think is closer to 85% a lot of you will<br>develop an acute hepatitis C illness you<br>might get jaundice you become very ill<br>then you'll either recover and eliminate<br>the virus and you won't have chronic<br>hepatitis C or you'll evolve into a<br>chronic hepatitis C situation but people<br>with chronic hepatitis C 20 to 30<br>percent will develop cirrhosis over 20<br>to 30 years so it's easy to remember<br>those numbers so a third of the people<br>hepatitis C grande up with cirrhosis<br>and lots of people with cirrhosis are<br>going to die of complications related to<br>that cirrhosis hepatitis C is a big risk<br>factor for peda cellular carcinoma<br>cirrhosis is a big risk factor for a pet<br>assay or carcinoma so that's what's<br>killing a lot of these people who<br>acquire hepatitis C one of the most<br>impressive things I've seen in the years<br>taking care of people with hepatitis C<br>is they feel terrible<br>becomes they come to your clinic and you<br>say how you feel I feel awful I'm tired<br>all the time I can't concentrate and for<br>decades we'd say quit whining you're<br>okay just this virus isn't hurting you<br>or you know it's we're gonna treat it<br>with something you're okay quit whining<br>about it well they're actually correct<br>it terribly reduces your quality of life<br>fatigue is a huge problem with hepatitis<br>C and there's almost a dementia that you<br>get with hepatitis C cognitive abilities<br>are clearly affected so people who have<br>high-level jobs you know air traffic<br>control scientists people who need very<br>sharp mental skills that will affect<br>their mental abilities so it's a in when<br>you cure these people with whatever<br>treatments you use they all will look<br>and say wow I feel like I'm out of the<br>fog I don't I haven't felt this way in<br>20 years it's rather remarkable and it's<br>now a document in fact this really<br>happens<br>so hepatology lectures get really boring<br>people start talking about genes and<br>pills and things and so I like to get<br>real life here so here are some healthy<br>livers and you can see the only problem<br>with these livers are still not attached<br>to the person there's one there and one<br>there it's the bottom side of the liver<br>you see they're big and they're generous<br>and they're smooth<br>well if cirrhosis this is what it looks<br>like this one's actually kind of big for<br>a cirrhotic liver unless your why this<br>one's so big but you see it's Nigel er<br>doesn't look right that's a in stage<br>liver there so this is normal liver<br>histology and you see all<br>beautiful pata sides arranged and nice<br>little cords and the spaces between the<br>portal areas the central veins all very<br>nice and regular looking this is a<br>cirrhotic liver so what's the real<br>difference well the difference are these<br>large bands of type one collagen that<br>surround this of pappa sides you're<br>putting these hepatocyte syn boxes now<br>if you guys go out and rot half your<br>liver tonight will be really sick for a<br>while you might have to the hospital but<br>ultimately you'll probably recover and<br>your liver will regenerate and you'll<br>get new to pata sites and you know your<br>liver volume will increase back close to<br>normal if you have all these little<br>boxes of fibrous tissue in your liver<br>your liver cells cannot regenerate so<br>you will not grow new petaa sides and I<br>was taught as a medical student once you<br>have cirrhosis you have cirrhosis the<br>rest your life you can't regenerate new<br>liver it's not quite true anymore we now<br>know people who have early cirrhosis or<br>advanced fibrosis when they get cured of<br>whatever was causing that damage we've<br>seen the cirrhosis or the fibrosis<br>reverse totally not what I was taught<br>when I was a student but now it's real<br>once you get this advanced cirrhosis<br>like this one there's no going back<br>shorter liver transplant the other big E<br>is the pata cellular carcinoma and<br>that's a big old one right there and<br>it's often multifocal because the liver<br>is cirrhotic and lots of areas of the<br>liver are all at risk for developing<br>tumor so you see lots of little<br>satellite nodules so if you see person<br>with hepatitis C they walk into your<br>clinic the interesting thing is eleven<br>percent already have cirrhosis they<br>don't know it their liver is severely<br>damaged but it's still working still<br>doing its job they don't know they have<br>cirrhosis yet 23 percent already have<br>advanced fibrosis they're heading<br>towards cirrhosis<br>so already you have a quite a number of<br>persons with significant damage to their<br>liver and if you look at who has this<br>hepatitis C plus people in their 40s<br>45:49 this peak right here caring the<br>prime of your life you know people by<br>now they're in their job they're in the<br>career ladder their days of risk factors<br>for how they got hepatitis E are long<br>gone they don't want to think about it<br>but these are the people who have most<br>of the hepatitis C so the median age of<br>diagnosis 47 so one other point about<br>the hepatitis C bar especially in New<br>Zealand is the genotypes because over<br>half of the persons with hepatitis C in<br>New Zealand have type 1 and that's going<br>to be important when we talk about<br>treatment options so 56% have genotype<br>one the second runner-up is going to be<br>genotype 3 there's lots of it in New<br>Zealand it's very rare in Texas where I<br>practice before we had genotype 1 also<br>as predominant one so where is it<br>worldwide well by far and away<br>China wins 30 million people with<br>hepatitis C New Zealand's a paltry<br>50,000 54,000 and second is Africa it's<br>20 million and North America 3 million<br>is higher than that I believe and most<br>of those live in South Dallas so<br>worldwide it is very common so 2.3 5% or<br>160 million people have hepatitis C so<br>you think of that disease burden these<br>people you know Leaney take 30% of those<br>are going to develop cirrhosis and the<br>pedicel or carcinoma<br>that's a huge morbidity and mortality<br>coming in New Zealand we believe it's<br>1.9<br>we're not really sure because it's not a<br>reportable disease here but we sort of<br>follow Australia and our trends and<br>that's the best estimate was about<br>54,000 here have hepatitis C might be<br>little higher the key point is half of<br>hepatitis C anybody positivity in<br>Dunedin okay you think of Dunedin is<br>fairly educated and we're not all day<br>out on the street shooting drugs but a<br>study here we're going to talk about<br>briefly found up to four percent of<br>random blood samples tested positive for<br>the antibody tests for hepatitis C<br>that's pretty alarming so this is a<br>study that was done from this<br>institution on the prevalence and<br>knowledge of hepatitis C and middle-aged<br>people and Dunedin New Zealand and it's<br>quite an interesting article before we<br>get into that let's give you the same<br>quiz we gave the people for the clinic<br>in the study so which of the following<br>are risk factors for transmission of the<br>hepatitis C virus in a household so<br>household contacts these are the<br>questions I get asked every time I see<br>somebody with hepatitis C about<br>preparing food is that a risk factor so<br>if I'm a chef and I'm preparing your<br>food<br>could I give you hepatitis C the answer<br>is no it's not a risk factor okay well<br>how about if we're sharing the same cups<br>same Forks or knives and stuff like that<br>is that a risk factor<br>no it's not how about sharing a<br>toothbrush I think that's weird<br>just going record I don't well I don't<br>share a toothbrush with my wife but so<br>sharing a toothbrush is a risk factor<br>you think about brushing your teeth<br>especially if you get get at it and you<br>draw a little blood with the bristles<br>onto your gums and then somebody else<br>comes behind uses the same brush yeah he<br>did have to have C about sharing toilet<br>facilities this could be a huge public<br>health problem if we didn't have<br>segregated toilets for hepatitis C<br>patients now not a risk factor at all<br>about<br>sexual contact that's a tough one is it<br>is it you know I get that asked that one<br>a lot<br>well I must do the New Zealand thing to<br>say yeah there it kind of is and kind of<br>isn't it's not zero<br>but it's not very high it 0.07%<br>transmitted per year among monogamous<br>couples the Japanese study and they<br>looked at monogamous presumably<br>monogamous couples and they have one who<br>had hep-c one didn't and it took ten<br>years before anybody contracted<br>hepatitis C and then after that it was<br>really low rate but the other<br>interesting thing about that steady is<br>they had different strains of viruses so<br>the spouse probably got from somewhere<br>else so not much of a contact not much<br>of a risk it's not zero though about<br>breastfeeding should these women<br>breastfeed their newborns that maybe<br>didn't get it therefore not a risk<br>factor so you don't change any of that<br>so in this study we I didn't but the<br>questionnaire was sent out on general<br>knowledge and risk factors for viral<br>hepatitis in hepatitis C and the score<br>was 59% were answered correctly so<br>wasn't too great but yeah some of those<br>questions are a little tricky and even<br>in a very educated crowd I mean these<br>things are not often common knowledge<br>mean II did not know that the toothbrush<br>risk was there 93 percent of the<br>population had no idea that you can have<br>asymptomatic hepatitis C so they just<br>think if you feel good you don't have it<br>25 percent had no idea you could be<br>treated for it and of the the analyzed<br>682 just rained them blood sitting<br>around the lab and four percent had<br>antibodies to hepatitis C now just<br>because you have antibodies hepatitis he<br>doesn't mean you have it but it's still<br>so what are our targets for therapeutics<br>well I told you there's only three<br>things we got that's it we can go after<br>the ns3 the serine protease and go the<br>NS 5a which is the RNA binding site or<br>when go for a NS 5 B which is the RNA<br>dependent RNA polymerase the key to<br>understanding all these drugs there's<br>too many to memorize and don't bother<br>but the nice things are all named the<br>same so if it's an NS 3 inhibitor<br>it's a ends in preview like perry kept<br>revere just off for beer if it's an RN<br>in s5 by nurse and as beers like i'm<br>bidis beer and if it's in this 5b<br>inhibitor it's a boo here that's it<br>so any drug they throw at you now for<br>hepatitis C you can liquor you all<br>that's a NS 5 B inhibitor or OD ACE<br>inhibitor so what is the history that<br>we've been talking about it's been<br>around not that long in 1986<br>somebody recognized non-a non-b<br>hepatitis is all this weird ice emember<br>as a medical student seeing people<br>coming to the liver clinic carrying<br>coolers with interferon on eyes and when<br>they have what they have non-a non-b<br>hepatitis it was sort of this mysterious<br>thing but what they found was if you had<br>non-a non-b hepatitis you put a minor<br>fear on the lfts got better now they all<br>felt like death warmed over but their<br>elytis got better so the doctors<br>consider that a win even though it<br>wasn't in 1989 we talked about we<br>discover we cloned it in 1991 interferon<br>was starting to be used for hepatitis C<br>in 95 we added ribe of iron and we got a<br>40% SVR SVR is the term that this is<br>equals cure sustained biological<br>remission that's just cure so people<br>it's too easy to put words like here so<br>we put dumb morons like SVR but 40% on<br>that initial treatment supposedly we're<br>going to be cured I've treated lots and<br>lots of people with that regimen i cured<br>nobody I mean a lot of people feel<br>terrible and they love me when they were<br>done because they felt great relative<br>I just cuz I not only her fear anymore<br>and then 2001 we got pegylated<br>interferon with 56% SVR rate I got a few<br>people here but not as many as that<br>would suggest and then in 2011<br>everything changed we got to previews so<br>protease inhibitors and these were awful<br>drugs but they worked really well I care<br>of lots of people with that well the<br>weird side effects for one of these<br>medicines it makes you get anal itching<br>you go well that's not that big of a<br>deal are you going to get cured of<br>hepatitis E it can destroy your life so<br>they had they call it weird rashes that<br>caused all sorts of strange things but<br>we cured lots of people so a lot of<br>doctors isn't banned in treating Hep C<br>for a long time I was one of the few<br>that would still do it in Texas and West<br>Texas and then in 2013 we started<br>getting the really good stuff got<br>next-generation they don't cause anal<br>itching or on these other weird things<br>and currently we're looking at Pan<br>genotypic once a day pills that have a<br>98% plus cure rate that's winning the<br>game if you get it into everybody so<br>this is just to show you that it's kind<br>of complicated right now so just<br>genotype one without cirrhosis genotype<br>1a without cirrhosis you got this as an<br>option of treating and in New Zealand we<br>have these two labissiere salaah severe<br>which is harvoni and then the spike era<br>pack and nothing else is available here<br>but elsewhere there's lots of other<br>options but it's still kind of<br>complicated well let's look at cirrhosis<br>with genotype 1 well even though you<br>guys change your regimens again so now<br>it's even more complicated well say well<br>I want easy so let's just go to<br>up-to-date and get their advice I just<br>want to know what pill to give this<br>person<br>there's ty genotype one oh my gosh<br>really I have to sort through that to<br>figure out so my enthusiasm is dropping<br>pretty rapidly if I'm not a dedicated<br>liver person so this is the state of the<br>art stuff right now and and you<br>the names are not important but if you<br>look at this one called maverick it<br>treats all genotypes epic loser all<br>genotypes and Pacific all genotypes<br>what we have is harvoni which will treat<br>genotypes one four five and six by<br>carrier pack which teach to genotype one<br>so ultimately I hope that we're going to<br>have a here's your pill take it once a<br>day for eight weeks you'll be cured<br>adios in there cure we're not quite<br>there yet we can treat gene type ones<br>okay we really have nothing in New<br>Zealand for hit genotypes three which is<br>nearly half not quite half that he's<br>close so this should be easy from now I<br>know we're kind of done we've cured<br>hepatitis C right we got great drugs<br>these have to wait for farming to get on<br>board get these drugs here here's your<br>pill you're cured so when we did get by<br>carry pack and harvoni released by farm<br>act so for GPS to prescribe and since<br>more than half the genotypes are Pepsi's<br>and New Zealand RG and type one we<br>should at least get rid of half the Hep<br>C and New Zealand right off the bat so<br>when we started it the GP is weren't<br>really buying into this too much the<br>first year about two thousand twenty one<br>hundred scripts were written for by<br>carry pack in the GPS wrote four hundred<br>twenty three in the first quarter of two<br>thousand eighteen there's only been two<br>hundred and sixty one scripts from I<br>carry pack and only 180 by GPS and<br>really only hundred fifty three by<br>secondary care sounds pretty pathetic<br>what's going on and if you think there's<br>fifty four thousand people here with<br>hepatitis C what fifty guests are all<br>this we have in this country we're not<br>going to see all those people gonna have<br>to be at the forefront of all this so<br>why haven't we won the game that's my<br>question this frustrated the heck I mean<br>when I was in Texas and we had drugs<br>that were available for anybody to<br>prescribe they're a little Messier<br>located but nobody would treat it other<br>than me<br>the family practice internal medicine<br>Doc's when did hepatologist would some<br>guests are all just wood but a lot of<br>people wouldn't so I got to New Zealand<br>thought I was a national health system<br>it'll be much better<br>no it's still GPS don't want to write<br>scripts for the stuff so why are there<br>so few prescribers that was my question<br>when I was in Texas and it's still my<br>question here so I did this study and<br>this was to identify barriers to<br>treatment for hepatitis C and primary<br>care so why are these people not<br>treating it and to answer that question<br>I asked the GPS and what I did is I sent<br>out oh this might these are my<br>objectives I'm going to identify<br>potential barriers find out why why one<br>you treat this what's your reason<br>I wanted to look at their attitudes the<br>current practice are they treating we<br>just don't know it and look at<br>demographic and regional differences in<br>treatment of Hep C and then also ask<br>them hey what can we do to make you want<br>to prescribe it or be okay with<br>prescribing it so I sent out a survey<br>and this is kind of an awful four-page<br>survey mailed to every GP in New Zealand<br>and I got that list by internet stalking<br>every GP in New Zealand went through the<br>PA chose got their list of doctors and<br>looked up their addresses and sent<br>everyone on the survey it's surprising I<br>got 24% back it's been too bad I thought<br>especially you look at the length of<br>that survey a lot of them had lots to<br>say unfortunately I left too much blank<br>spots for them to write and write they<br>did oh my gosh it was insane so this one<br>I found out that this is an experienced<br>group that responded to the survey in 22<br>years in practice so this is a seasoned<br>group most of the were in groups of five<br>I was surprised I thought there are lots<br>of solos or groups of two but most human<br>groups of five or more less than 5% or<br>by themselves and the shocking thing is<br>that<br>be percent said they do not write for<br>Pepsi treatment and nobody in their<br>practice writes for Pepsi they're not<br>interested in managing Hep C nobody in<br>their practice them or anyone else in<br>their practice 21% said that they are<br>currently prescribing treatment which<br>was kind of encouraging but not great so<br>we said well if how about if you've been<br>educated so if you eat D<br>you only have two buttons I don't hey<br>mess it up but I did okay so careful in<br>this slide so this is what we just<br>talked about this far as interest in<br>managing hepatitis C 17% had no interest<br>in managing a cup of type C currently<br>prescribed 21% said they do we just<br>talked about those how many completed<br>medical education activities already 54<br>percent and how many were offered<br>medical educational activities 65<br>percent so not too bad<br>also we found that history of hepatitis<br>C training was clearly associated with<br>prescribing activities so if you got<br>trained you're way more likely to bribe<br>than if you were not trained in some<br>fashion and this is by D H by sort dhb<br>and you can see that the red bars are<br>kind of important one there's the ones<br>that initial this is confidence quotas<br>on a 0 to 100 scale 100 being I am the<br>best Hep C treatment person on the<br>planet because 0 as I know nothing<br>how confident are you for treating<br>hepatitis C and in awk Northland about<br>63 percent confidence quota in treating<br>hepatitis C for people who've been<br>trained versus EO down here to find<br>annuity and more those people are not<br>too confident living person or so just a<br>big variation across the country on how<br>confident you are in treating Hep C the<br>black bars or the people who have not<br>had hepatitis C at the same dhp so you<br>can see confidence goes way up when<br>you've had<br>training this is no surprise overall<br>conference was about 38 and 4 we also<br>asked him if something else started it<br>how confident are you to maintain it and<br>they felt better about that 58 number on<br>that confident level so we said well<br>maybe it's my years in practice maybe<br>the young guys are way more enthusiastic<br>about it so the green bars are the<br>people who've been in practice less than<br>five years the black bars are the people<br>who are just about to retire they've had<br>enough so if you look at interest<br>nathless no difference they're really<br>prescribing Hep C not none of these<br>recent statistical significance but it's<br>the people who are kind of the middle<br>part of their career that a little more<br>likely to be offered education completed<br>Medical Education on Pepsi but not<br>anything that's significant so how about<br>if you're not grouped by yourself or<br>during a big group and if you're all by<br>yourself you're a little more interested<br>in things again none of these recent<br>statistical significance at all but the<br>guys by themselves were a little more<br>likely to prescribe they were more more<br>interested so what are the reasons well<br>these are the reasons they came up with<br>and we're not going to talk about them<br>all cuz there's too many what are the<br>important ones so inadequate<br>reimbursement big surprise there it's<br>always about money I'm not getting paid<br>for my time this is complicated this is<br>hard I'm busy I don't have time you know<br>for you know the amount of reimbursement<br>to use up my time in this so that was<br>the biggest one 44% of GP said that's<br>problem closed number two and three is<br>they say I don't have enough Hep C<br>patients to make it worthwhile that's a<br>very interesting complaint or barrier<br>not enough we're all these 54,000 people<br>that are out there caseload with other<br>patients I'm just too busy 40 percent<br>said that I can't get a fiber scan quick<br>enough or easy enough I don't know how<br>to do it so getting a fiber scan which<br>is<br>commanded in our guidelines to get<br>before you treat a lot of people just to<br>the eyes too much I can't do that lack<br>of expertise they just don't feel like<br>they're up to it and lots of people<br>consider this a specialist area so<br>that's also very important barrier so<br>let's talk about reimbursement 44% said<br>that's a problem so interestingly enough<br>up in the north is 4d HP's that gave<br>their GPS extra money to treat Hep C<br>it's somewhere between 100 and 300<br>dollars per case so they're prescribing<br>rate went up 31% treated hepatitis C<br>versus 16% elsewhere so that's pretty<br>good but those same doctors said hey<br>it's I'm not getting enough money for<br>this so there's still a problem even<br>though you're paying them more but yeah<br>it's one of those things that you paid<br>me a million dollars I want 10 million<br>dollars that's just if dreamers must<br>always probably this is what they would<br>say in those those dreaded lines if<br>money is unfortunately the biggest<br>barriers not viable money's good bait<br>and funding it for a 45-minute consult<br>is a very common statement so let's talk<br>about their practice in a caseload so 40<br>percent reported that not treating their<br>hepatitis C due to they just don't have<br>enough patients in their practice that<br>habit so it's not really worth their<br>while they're not they don't have a<br>hepatitis C heavy practice so this is I<br>think well the best slides of the whole<br>thing so I we said how many patients do<br>you have in your practice that nobody<br>really knows I never known how many<br>patients are in my practice but people<br>like to estimate and so this is on the<br>left here is let's say the GP said I<br>have between 5,000 and 10,000 patients<br>in my practice 36 percent of GP said<br>that now we say how many patients of Hep<br>C do you have your practice the average<br>was I got 22 I think in my practice and<br>the median was 10 now if you<br>take the predicted Pepsi rate a 1.9% and<br>put it in loose numbers those people<br>ought to have 95 290 patients with Hep C<br>in the practice you look at the people<br>who said man I got the biggest practice<br>on the planet not many people said that<br>but they said I got 28 people with Hep C<br>well they ought to have more than 380 so<br>they're way not thinking big enough on<br>the number people in your practice that<br>should have hepatitis C throw off by<br>factors of two point three to seven but<br>this that's a major finding on this so<br>the practice they say things like you<br>know I can't manage this with all the<br>other issues they have those fiber scan<br>availability this was a really wildly<br>varying complaint 35% people said that's<br>one of the problems for them but it's<br>various wildly from 8 to 67% by DEHP and<br>this is what they told us hey make it<br>easier we've won direct access which is<br>really interesting that we have direct<br>access pretty much here but they were<br>still saying they want direct access<br>they said no it training this is also a<br>big one lack of training adequate<br>training or expertise 30% of GPS I just<br>don't feel up to it<br>and their suggestions were just keep<br>educating increase our opportunities at<br>present Mosul's are very time pressure<br>doing long days practice financial<br>viability is a looming issue so we're<br>feeling under the gun or trying to keep<br>up with all these mandates lot of them<br>believe that this is just a dump from<br>secondary care we don't want to do this<br>this should be a guess or all this or<br>infectious disease job that's a big<br>problem<br>so he said what he suggests well<br>interestingly most of them said we were<br>more training okay and then they said we<br>want more money fair enough<br>and we want clear guidelines but they<br>you look at the percentages there it<br>really dropped off you know I went from<br>you know a third of the suggestions of<br>increased training and reimbursement you<br>know 11 percent so their suggestions<br>weren't didn't quite follow their<br>barriers so much but what we concluded<br>with this study is that the perceived in<br>adequate reimbursement coupled with them<br>already feeling overburdened overwhelmed<br>under the gun they just don't take on<br>new responsibilities they're already<br>just maxed out so our conclusion with<br>this is that if you just give them more<br>money that's not gonna fix the problem<br>it'll help that by itself this is not<br>just throw more money at a problem I do<br>think he should the healthcare<br>organizations should look at funding<br>based on real-world resources and time<br>in it it's going to get easier so the<br>funding may change as it gets easier<br>improving access to help I see education<br>really needs to be national priority you<br>know we only heard back from a quarter<br>of these people and a whole mess of them<br>or just in smaller towns and have<br>absolutely no opportunity to get<br>education<br>so maybe a online educational activity<br>that's relevant and efficient would be<br>an option but I think the biggest<br>finding in this was the lack of<br>awareness of the prevalence of hepatitis<br>C is the biggest barrier these people<br>just start looking for it<br>they're not going to ask all their<br>patients who walk in well when you were<br>20 where you shooting drugs well I don't<br>want to talk about that patients don't<br>want to talk about that so I don't think<br>asking the GPS to find all these people<br>is realistic or going to work I think<br>you have to have a national health<br>approach you have a public health<br>approach to this type of thing so I<br>think we need a clear head<br>see screening strategy and with a public<br>health approach so that's good thank you<br>that's a great both update and new<br>information certainly for me most up was<br>ion pediatrician so I've just can I just<br>ask you to say a bit more about the<br>breastfeeding respecter I mean when I<br>last up this for seven or eight years<br>ago so the information must have changed<br>you're still a big question mark about<br>you know breastfeeding you know sort of<br>cracked nipples blood coming from the<br>mother to the baby you know it happens<br>so how solid is that bit about this<br>feeding not being a respecter for<br>therefore that baby it's solid enough<br>now pretty much all the major groups and<br>societies recommend breastfeeding it's<br>been looked at a number of times<br>nobody's ever shown it to be a risk<br>factor by itself now vertical<br>transmission is still a risk factor but<br>the breastfeeding I it's been looked up<br>pretty heavily on yep okay that's good<br>and I said any great from the postnatal<br>point of view because I don't think they<br>screen mother's blood for hip C and the<br>international screening right then this<br>it's a microbiologist in the community<br>laboratory and I think the main issue is<br>lack of GP understanding of the disease<br>process of Pepsi in the genealogy um and<br>I think you're right that they're not<br>comfortable necessarily asking people<br>about history of IV drug use and people<br>not necessarily comfortable about<br>discussing IV drug use I think also that<br>the prevalence of Hep C in our country<br>is probably pocketed I suspect that<br>there's higher rates of Dunedin for<br>example compared with some other places<br>some preliminary data from Auckland and<br>Northland suggested higher rates and<br>North and say compared with Auckland<br>there's enormous amount east thing going<br>on so it left his last year we tested<br>35,000 people for hip seeing people<br>so there is actually enormous amounts of<br>testing going on it's probably that a<br>lot of the teasing has been aimed at the<br>wrong people and sort of the worried<br>well the middle classes hope I'm seeing<br>them we did do an anonymous<br>seroprevalence study some years ago of<br>antenatal samples in Auckland we tested<br>a thousand and there were only three<br>that were antibody positive and of those<br>three only one had a decent anybody<br>positivity level and the other two were<br>quite low level of Mahlon fake things of<br>low level false positives what we do see<br>we need testing a low prevalence<br>population so I don't think that there<br>is a role for widespread screening among<br>internet'll women pregnant women I think<br>another thing around screening that's<br>not perhaps well understood except for<br>me begging on about it and seasonally is<br>in contrast to some other tests like HIV<br>TS that hepatitis E interview this is<br>actually expensive but I mean it's not<br>like expensive like a PCR T's but it's<br>certainly not cheap like an HIV test and<br>so there is a balance between you know<br>risks and benefits in terms of the<br>economics of the testing and I think<br>that's why we've tried to have this<br>targeted testing approach which i think<br>is valid but I think it hasn't been<br>managed well and primary here LeBron in<br>terms of the costs and you mentioned the<br>cost of tests what's the cost of I think<br>you said six or eight weeks of treatment<br>or one bill and and weighing it up<br>against the long-term costs of chronic<br>cirrhosis Cepeda cellular carcinoma that<br>you would be preventing still a deal to<br>treat and prevent the complications of<br>cirrhosis need for a liver transplant<br>all the medical care of a cirrhotic<br>patient it's still a good deal the<br>problem with these misses they're<br>horribly expensive when harvoni first<br>was released in the United States and<br>even to this day it's roughly a thousand<br>dollars per day or per pill it's insane<br>now there's the only it's a cheaper<br>price on things like bike carrier pack<br>and I'm sure they get you on the harvoni<br>I don't know what it is but I think<br>they're still in the range of fifty<br>thousand dollars for a course of<br>treatment<br>right okay there's somebody needs to do<br>the numbers well one good admission for<br>cirrhotic with the GI hemorrhage and<br>patter anal syndrome will blow through<br>that in two days so one further question<br>you mentioned Lisa G is a key symptom in<br>some and you know the range of people<br>may want an answers but if you present<br>to G I mean the presentation of lethargy<br>is very common if you're not jaundiced<br>and you don't have a history of IV drugs<br>or should you routinely check for I mean<br>I would normally check a liver functions<br>in but I wouldn't necessarily do the<br>full virus hepatitis virus screen should<br>I be that's a really good question and I<br>think ideally if they're in that age<br>range from 30 to 60 I would I think a<br>lot of people to argue against that<br>that's such of a nonspecific symptom<br>that it's that's a tough one to say I<br>have - I think I'd have to probe more<br>for some risk factors but they should<br>want to talk about that so I think if if<br>I was saying somebody with nuance said<br>just fatigue and achy and sore that non<br>specific stuff they had pre part of my<br>work is just a Hep C anybody living<br>function themselves they're not good<br>enough their function tests are not good<br>enough because lots of Hep C page will<br>have normal liver function tests quite<br>frequently it'll spike up and down if<br>you don't catch them during the spikes<br>you'll miss it and with the labs be<br>happy with us I mean I think I think<br>probably testing in the community for<br>fatigue is probably one of the most<br>difficult consults that primary care do<br>and it's one of the things that leads to<br>a speeding a lot of tests that we<br>probably look at and thinking on see<br>it's cool but I agree with what dr.<br>Johnson saying that actions don't it is<br>it is a symptom of hips they'd like to<br>see an alt but you're right that Aoki's<br>not always elevated so it's better than<br>STI testing an 18 year old female<br>engineering students which we're seeing<br>give you more targeting there are<br>clearly published guidelines of risk<br>factors out there that if you have any<br>of those you're supposed to be tested it<br>is very complicated and just the that<br>the risk factors that are listed out<br>there so broad that it's very hard for<br>somebody to go through all those things<br>you know I think it's yeah unless that's<br>really the the crux of the problem is<br>how do you find the people who have the<br>risk factors it's easy to test them but<br>getting those risk factors Allen was a<br>tough I thought was great in your age<br>and your past when you're at university<br>and in an expert at risk and I don't<br>know if it's still there but it was<br>quite nice because it's something that<br>people could do in the privacy of their<br>own home and then perhaps they achieve<br>me I'm worried about<br>Hep C and in it and of itself there's<br>probably enough to to go on with this<br>thing without it being out of the street<br>so it would be interesting to see if it<br>still is on that wheel I'm pretty sure<br>it was a hit foundation website be nice<br>to have it all disintegrated I recently<br>did there's a Ministry of Health's AER<br>perang<br>whither you should have your prostate<br>antigen screen you go through and put<br>them all your preferences minutes but<br>start saying on the whole this is what<br>you should do<br>I found it quite helpful I wanted to see<br>what was behind it and that's always the<br>issue you do these things and you know<br>you have they got that all the equations<br>right but they should all be amalgamated<br>somewhere are the questions in which<br>case I will say thank you very much to<br>Steve it's been a fascinating<br>presentation and<br>I'm sure we'll have another update and<br>another you know a few years time to<br>hopefully have a national strategy thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
